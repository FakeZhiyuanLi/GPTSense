      Happy early Thanksgiving to all.  I hope that travel plans are working out, and that everyone is preparing for big feasts ahead.  I won't be able to post my Thanksgiving wishes tomorrow, since I will be at home, where I have no internet.  I am a little depressed about the holiday, because I will be missing my family, who are 3,000 miles away.  Well, I don't know the exact mileage, but I do know that it's very far and that I won't be with them.  But it'll be better this way.  This way, I'll have a very productive weekend and will not have to worry about getting to spend enough time with my family.  So, happy holidays to all.  Eat lots of turkey and gravy (or whatever it is you do to celebrate) tomorrow, and enjoy football or shopping or just visiting with family, or whatever your weekend may entail.

      A friend of mine, my very best friend really, has a great quote up in her away message that I just felt compelled to share:   It is never too late to become what you might have been. ~ George Eliot   This means a lot to me, and it really made me stop and think.  Lately, I've been questioning my career path choice, and all the other choices I've made in my life.  I used to take ballet, and I always wanted to be a ballet dancer since I was very little.  A part of me still does, even though I haven't taken a ballet class in years, am woefully out of shape, and could never ever get back to where I was, and even if I could, I still wouldn't be good enough to actually do it.  But I still feel great regret over the whole thing.  I took the easy way out.  I didn't want to have to work as hard as I would have had to in order to make it happen, so I just gave it up and went to do something else instead.  But I've always avoided doing things I really want.  I don't know if it's because I'm afraid of failing or what, but I always do it.  A part of me has always wanted to write scripts and make movies, and while I've dabbled a little on my own, I've never done anything to actually make it happen in the real world.  I justify it by telling myself that those things I've always wanted most in the world are pipe dreams, and that I am not a dreamer, but a rational, practical person, who would never do something as crazy as that.  Instead, I've always made the rational choice...or what I thought was the most rational choice at the time.  And the rational choice is always the safe choice.  That's why I'm in law school now.  It was absolutely the safest, most rational choice I could have made after college.  Not that a part of me doesn't want to do it, I'm just not sure that it is right.   I worry that it really is to late for me to become what I might have been, but wiser people disagree.  And that gives me hope.

      I'm feeling spunky today, folks.  Well, as spunky as a girl can feel on a limited night's sleep.  Guess the adrenaline is starting to kick in now that finals season is upon me.  Well, me and the rest of the crowd here at St. John's University School of Law.  Around this time of year, the tension in the library really picks up; it is palpable as soon as one enters the building.  It's hard to handle at times, but since I'm a veteran compared to the poor 1Ls who are getting ready for their first law school exams ever, I think that it isn't as bad for me.  It isn't a matter of knowing whehter I can succeed anymore.  Instead, it is a matter of endurance.  I just hope I can make it to the end.  And today, I feel like I can.

      Here are  urlLink the vote totals  from the Senate on the big Medicare/prescription drug bill today.  Apparently, the Democrats say there are major problems with the bill.  I will confess to not knowing very much about it (having been in a little time warp called law school for the past few months), but I will say that I think it is interesting that the only two people not to vote on the measure at all are both running for president:  Kerry and Lieberman.  My theory (and it's not very deep or original, I'm sure) is that neither one of them wants to vote against it, because the Republicans are going to use this to say that they were the ones who got prescription drug legislation through the Congress, but they also didn't want to vote for it, either for ideological reasons or in case Democrats are right, and the legislation tends to harm the elderly or turns out to be unpopular among them.  Hence, the no shows.  Or perhaps they were just too busy campaigning to bother.  Edwards, who is also in the Senate and is also running for president, did show up to vote against the measure.

      I am sitting right above you, but you don't know I'm there.  I stare at you Boldly Across the way Knowing that you will not look mine That you will not notice That you do not know I exist. And if you did happen to glance my way I'd look down, or over, or anywhere else, Just to not be caught up in your stare, Just to avoid your attention, Just to stay away, Even though that is the last thing I want.  I peer over the rail And down upon you where you sit below Your back to me so it's truly safe And I wish I were next to you. Or even that you'd just turn And look up And you'd see me and smile And I'd somehow find the courage to smile back. But of all these possibilities The last is the least likely. Because I am hopelessly, consistently afraid. So I stop my peering And return to whatever it is I should be doing, Doing my best to ignore the distraction The nagging image of you In my mind Sitting below, And I know that before I leave I will stoop to peer down on you yet again And hope that you turn and see, But praying even more that you don't.  This is my torment, My punishment for some unknown evil deed, That I should want constantly to know you, Hope constantly to see you, And yet be frozen by fear, contrained by some unknown force From ever so doing. The most I will ever do is see you. I will never know you.

      I'm feeling very inadequate at the moment.  My complete inability to open up to even my closest friends on certain things, my constant pretending to be some variation of who I am, but never completely myself, around people because, try as I might to deny it, I really do care what others think of me, sometimes to the point that it is pathological, is all beginning to frustrate me just a bit.  Also, though, I feel a strong and compelling fear that is forcing me almost not to change.  I continue to see people at school that I would like to know or want to learn more about, yet my stubborn and unassailable refusal to DO anything about it depresses me to my very inner core.  I don't let people see myself for fear of being broken, yet I end up broken anyway, unable to operate in the world at all.    And all this after my weekend seemed so hopeful.  I guess there is still hope for the week as well.  I do have a certain resiliency of the spirit that comes out; it acts as my defense mechanism in times like this, especially at times like this when I am very stressed and very susceptible to these thoughts and feelings and depressions, and hopefully it will save me yet again.  And hopefully one day soon I will learn my lesson, learn to be more assertive, and go for things and just tell people how I really feel, regardless of the potential harmful consequences.  It's better than living a lie, and it's better than being alone.

      James Taranto quotes a reader in  urlLink yesterday's Opinion Journal  joking about the potential political implications of the Michael Jackson story that is consuming the news this week:   I have to hand it to Karl Rove. Getting Michael Jackson arrested less than a year before the presidential election is a stroke of genius for the re-election of George W. Bush.     "When it comes to news coverage, the 24-hour news networks, major newspapers, local stations--everyone--will be focused on that. Who's going to pay attention to the whiny Democrats and their complaints about Iraq (especially since the economy is improving)--when the Michael Jackson trial is going on? Talk about a feeding frenzy!   A year from now as people are getting ready for Thanksgiving and Christmas, they're going to pause and say, "Wasn't there supposed to be an election or something this year? Oh, well."   Don't know how Rove pulled it off, but it's brilliant."   Obviously, for anyone who is offended, the above is meant tongue-in-cheek.  And for anyone who doesn't read or subscribe the Opinion Journal's Best of the Web should do so immediately.  It gives a little summary of the news of the day in a humorous, albeit conservative, manner.

      Check  urlLink this out .  I wasn't sure where it was going at first, but it's pretty cool, if you are the schmaltzy patriotic type, which I am.  Even if not, the artistry of it is interesting.  It's amazing what people can do with digital technology and the internet these days.

      Well, I was remiss in posting yesterday, I know.  It wasn't for lack of things to post about though.  It's just getting to be crunch time here for me at law school, so I don't really have the time.  It isn't stopping me from doing it now, of course, and probably won't stop me from updating occasionally throughout the day, but since I'm not sure if anyone is even reading this, I won't feel that bad if I don't get to it.  Mainly it's an outlet for me anyway, and if I don't have the time, then I'm the one who's getting hurt.  And yes, in case you were wondering, it really is all about me.  Now back to work.  I'm outlining for my tax class, trying to see if I really know anything from the massive amount of material we covered in class.  So far, I've done pretty well in school, but this class may be the one that does me in.  Or it may just be one of those things that I have to let go.  Hopefully, after a day spent in the library agonizing over the Internal Revenue Code, I will have a better handle on it.  'Til then...

      Here I thought I was being clever with the name of my blog, but a quick Google search turns up  urlLink these results  for "yankee from mississippi."  So much for originality, which I feel is pretty much dead.  It's so hard to be original these days; it seems like almost everything has been said or done before.  Does nothing have the capacity to surprise us anymore?

      Had a big scare today.  I was with my study group, and we were looking over practice exams for Tax class, and we were having major trouble answering the problems.  Not that I was expecting it to be an easy ride, but even the concepts were foreign to me which, considering I rarely miss that class, was cause for great alarm at this stage in the game.  Luckily, for us, we had exams for the Corporate class rather than the Personal class, which is the one we are taking.  The fact that it took us so long to figure this out is a sad, sad thing, that is a subject for another day; today I am choosing to focus on the positive, not the negative.  I'm trying this new thing called "optimism" and you all should really give it a try.

      Here is some  urlLink good news   (link requires registration--but you all should register--it's the New York Times, after all) out of Massachusetts.  As a straight person, it continues to embarrass me that there is any question as to the right of homosexuals to marry.  As a Christian, it shocks me that so many others of my faith are willing not only to verbally condemn what they feel (however erroneously) is a sin, but are desirous of passing judgment on their fellow man here on earth by restricting their rights, even though it is God's place to judge and not man's.  And as a conservative, it angers me that so many so-called conservatives are willing to intrude on people's private lives and private decisions and are willing to  urlLink expand the power of the federal government  in the process, to achieve what is essentially a non-libertarian end with what is essentially a liberal means.    It's a world gone mad.  But I guess none of it should surprise me in the least.

      In other news, there is this really annoying girl sitting in the cafeteria at school, popping bubble wrap incessantly.  As I turn around to glare at her for the tenth time, she still doesn't notice, or doesn't care.  No one else seems to notice either, or be annoyed by her actions, so I thought I'd post here, just so I could vent a little, and make my frustrations felt.

      I love the way you can hide in a crowded, large room.  It affords one a good opportunity for people watching, or surveillance, or spying, or whatever you want to call it, that one doesn't get when sitting in a smaller space, such as a classroom or a subway car.  This, as I'm thinking about it, probably sounds pretty creepy, but people really are fascinating to watch, and there are times when you want to just stare at a person, but don't want the uncomfortable feeling of having their eyes meet yours and for them to know, by the quick way you shift your attention to the floor, or to someone else, anything else, that you were staring at them.  Across a crowded room, this type of scenario is highly unlikely.  Of course, it also has the effect of making one feel very detached and alone at the same time as it affords interesting observation opportunities.

      Coolest TV character to be completely given the shaft:  John Hoynes (Tim Matheson) from The West Wing.  He was my favorite character on the show, and I really looked forward to the episodes he was in.  I miss him so much, though, the show did the very best they could in replacing him with Gary Cole, who is a wonderful actor.  I just hope they end up doing something more than they have so far with the character.  I've got my fingers crossed for this week's show, but I'm not holding out too much hope.  A once great show has proven, this season, to be a major disappointment.

      For something that isn't all about me, read A.O. Scott (film critic for the  New York Times --he and I are on the same page when it comes to likes and dislikes) on  urlLink movie piracy  (link requires registration).  I don't mean to burst anyone's fun, or to pass judgment on anyone who downloads movies illegally.  It's just, I think, important to think about the impact that piracy has on those in the industry, not the stars who make millions of dollars per film, but for the people behind the scenes, who are really middle class or working class guys like the majority of other people, except they happen to work in Hollywood.  Also, the campaign that the motion picture industry is putting on in order to thwart the pirates is very interesting.  I've seen the Goldstein spot that Scott talks about in the article, and I found it to be very effective.  I don't mean to preach, but I do think that as individuals who live in society, it is important that when we act, we think about the consequences of our actions, even if those consequences don't change our minds.  So, don't worry--I'll step off the soapbox now.

      I'm such a fool.  There's this guy at school that I find attractive.  It's silly, because whenever I see him, I feel like I'm back in high school, like I have a crush (my heart even skips a beat and everything), even though I should be beyond this stage of my life by this point.  The other day I saw him, and he was wearing a suit.  Now, I don't know this guy (I've only spoken to him once, and I'm pretty sure he wouldn't remember me from then), and I'm not much of a believer in casual sex, but if he had randomly come up to me and propositioned me, I'm quite sure I would have said yes.  Well, at least in the deep and abstract recesses of my mind I would have; in reality, and let's face it, something like this would never ever ever happen, it would be a different story.  Anyway, this is not my point.  I'm posting this now because I'm sitting here in the library (considering this is the second post I've sent from the library, you must all be thinking I'm a pretty big geek by now), and I just saw him again, and I felt like telling someone.  These are things that it is not that easy for me to talk about, but for some reason, posting them anonymously in cyberspace is easier.  And hopefully it will make me feel better to get it all out, so that I can get back to work.  I've never been much of a relationship person; I've always been independent and tend to push peopel away when they get too close.  In the words of Elvis Costello:  "I don't want to kiss you.  I don't want to touch.  I don't want to see you, 'cause I don't miss you that much."  As an aside, that song is called "No Action" and it's from an album called   urlLink This Year's Model  , and Elvis Costello is a genius, so you can't go wrong.  But I digress.  Most of the time I'm being alone, even if I'll be alone for a very long time, because there have always been things that are more important to me.  It only bothers me when there are people like this guy around, to remind me that I do feel; it's then that I feel truly lonely.  So, I'm such a fool.  That's what I wanted to say.  I'm such a fool for letting opportunities like this go by, for not going up to him, or even smiling at him, at least acknowledging that I've seen him, that I know he exists, even if he doesn't have a clue who I am.  But I don't, and I just didn't, and I'm quite sure I never will.  And then I will have missed any chance.  Until the next guy, when I'll repeat the whole silly psychodrama all over again.  And if anyone out there is still reading this by then, then I suppose you'll get to hear about it.  But I suppose there's no use thinking about it now.  The moment has passed, and there is work to be done.

      I'm sitting in the library, trying to get caught up on the reading that I haven't been doing all semester.  As a side note, to anyone reading this who might be thinking about attending law school:  DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THREE WEEKS BEFORE FINALS TO TRY AND GET CAUGHT UP ON THE READING.  So now you know.  I cannot recall what the main point of this post was supposed to be.  I guess I'm just a little down because I'd really like this blog to be a place where I express my thoughts on the big important issues of the day, but with all the time that law school sucks up, I only have the time or energy to post about...well, about how much law school sucks or how much my life sucks or how much I'd rather be at the dentist than sitting here getting caught up on my Criminal Law reading.  I know that these things cannot possibly be of much interest to the great folks out there reading this...I mean, they're barely of interest to me.  Hopefully, once the semester ends, I will be able to get caught up on the world around me, and will have interesting things to say.  In the meanwhile, check out  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  (also linked to the right) for content along these lines much better than anything you could ever hope to find here, even on my best of days.  Chances are if you're reading this, though, you already know who he is, and the link is completely unecessary.  Ah, well.  Enough wasting time.  Back to work!

      Today, to lighten things up a bit, I thought I'd regale everyone with tales of my evening commute last night.  First, there was the guy who was next to me on the train who was sleeping.  As he drifted off into the world of slumber, he slid to the side so that he was leaning on me.  Normally, I do not like such invasions of my space, but he smelled of sweet tobacco, and he was tired, so I didn't mind so much.  It's not like he did it on purpose.  Eventually, he woke up and sat back up straight, and it didn't happen again; when I got the chance, I slid down a little bit so that I wasn't right up next to him, so that he would have space to sleep and I would have space to read for Torts.  This is one of those "New York Moments" that some people find endearing, others find revolting, and I am growing increasingly ambivalent about the longer I live in New York City.    Then, after I departed the F train and made my way down the surly streets to my apartment, I saw the Christmas decorations were up at Bloomingdales.  I'd never seen them before.  They have strings of white lights dangling, forming a sheet across the top of the building; they also have large wreaths filled with red lights.  As I saw this, it suddenly hit me that Thanksgiving is almost here, and that with that, Christmas cannot be far behind.  I suddenly got very scared, since this really drove home the point that finals season is upon me, and I'm woefully unprepared for any of them.  It also made me feel a little...well, I guess nostalgic is the best description, since I usually call it depression, but that doesn't quite capture the feeling, for it is happy at the same time it is sad...for Christmas season, since it is my favorite time of year.  It also made me realize how much I miss my family, who are all back home in Mississippi.   Then, as I turned my attention from the decorations to the people walking down the sidewalk in opposition to me, I noticed that there were an inordinate number of couples walking down the street.  Now, this depressed me, but I will not linger on it; I will only say that it didn't depress me as much as it should have.  I've been alone for a while now, so I guess I've just gotten used to it, and while there are times I long for something more, I realize it isn't going to happen to me any time soon, so I've just accepted it and moved on.  As wise religious folk say:  "It's in God's hands."  So, how's that for not lingering on it?

      Something I don't think I made clear from my first post, something that is very important to me, and that is my faith and my Christianity.  So, in that spirit, today's post is from Judges 12:6:             Then they said unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he                    could not frame to pronounce it right.   Shibboleth was a password, used to distinguish members of one tribe from members of another, who pronounced it Sibboleth (those of you who watch The West Wing are probably familiar with this story).  In other words, as one of my professors says (in albeit a different context), "You can't fake this stuff."  Faith cannot be faked, and if you try to fake it, you will be found out in the end.  It will be obvious to God, as obvious as a mispronunciation.  That being said, I don't shove my beliefs down other people's throats.  I post here who I am, my thoughts and my feelings.  If you like it, fine; if you don't, it's equally fine.  Or, in the words of one of my fellow classmates:  "I don't judge; I just accept."  Share your thoughts all you want, call me crazy for anything I write here.  The quote above is meant to address the intracacies of all kinds of faith, for all of us, not just faith in God, and not just for those who are religious in any way.  After all, even the Bible says that Love is greater than Faith.

      Well, this is my first post, the beginning of my great blog adventure in cyberspace.  Perhaps that statement is a bit redundant, since the idea of a blog implies a location in cyberspace, but I think those of you reading this will forgive me for my redundancy, as well as for my neurotic tendencies, which should be all too clear to you by now.  I guess I should tell a little bit about myself for those people reading this who don't know me.  My name is Shannon.  I'm from Mississippi, but I live in New York now and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  I'm currently in law school, which I wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you are really sure you want to be a lawyer, and even then I'd pause.  But my judgment may be clouded by the fact that I am deep in the throes of exam preparation and I know that it is only going to get worse before it gets better, so perhaps we'll have to revisit this topic when I graduate.  Since I'm in law school, I really don't have that much time for other interests, but when I do, I like to watch television, read, go to the movies, and follow current political events.  I've read blogs before, and thought they were pretty cool and, more importantly, that it would be something fun that I might actually be good at, so, coupling this with my deep feelings of the importance of myself and the things I have to say (read:  I'm self-absorbed and little arrogant), I figured I was the perfect candidate to do this sort of thing.  So here I am.  If you're bored already, then I wouldn't recommend coming back.  But if not, I promise all my posts won't be so, well, self-centered.  So enjoy your future adventures on the web, whether they bring you back here or not.

      A strange thing occurred to me today: Christmas, which is normally my favorite time of year, depressed me, still inexplicably, while New Year's, which is normally depressing, has not had such an effect at all.  I can't say that I'm happy it's New Year's Eve, but I am in a good mood...perhaps despite the impending new year.  I have no explanation for this reaction at all.  I am only grateful that the gloom of last week is gone.  Sorry for my absence...I have been immersed in the world of Harry Potter (now in the 4th book...all I can say so far is...WOW), and been busy spending time with friends and family...lunch, movies ( Something's Gotta Give  is greatly funny and everyone should see it), football (Southern Miss, my dad's alma mater - and my sister's too, come to think of it - just lost to Utah in the Liberty Bowl), the works (played a great game called Scene-It - a must if you are into movies).  Hardly have had time for anything else...  Happy early New Year to all!

      The first sign of trouble was upon my last visit The loss of my bed. I walked by the room and found it occupied By another. In my room. Little was I to know at the time That this would be the last time My feet would grace the presence Of that humble yet majestic abode. I was to be cast aside, Forgotten, Like last year's Christmas toys When the new ones are opened. I'm last year's model, Tattered and torn, Welcome outworn, Never to return to the house and the family I love Who I thought loved me. It is the end of happiness And the beginning of that which follows it. I am utterly and hopelessly alone.

      Ugh.  I'm groggy from a nap.  Does anyone out there notice how hard it is to wake up from a nap in the middle of the day, no matter how long you sleep for, you always feel awful.  But I really needed a nap today.  I was up late reading, and then I awoke fairly early to meet a friend of mine from lunch.  She's my best friend from high school.  We aren't really best friends anymore, because she and I don't talk all that much.  But I still love her to death, and every time I get together with her (which is not all that often - the perils of choosing a college and law school 3000 miles away from home) I feel very happy, and I feel like, even though it's been ages since we last spoke, that it really hasn't...if that makes any sense.  Incidentially, I always say it is 3000 miles from Gulfport to New York....But I do not know this for a fact...I just say it because it sounds right...exact mileage coming soon...

      I had all these big plans for what I was going to get done over the break.  One of them was losing some weight.  I have no idea how I thought that was going to happen.  It's not like I'm fat, I could just stand to lose some weight.  It's funny, but I still have the same hang-ups about weight that I had when I was dancing.  I still feel guilty when I eat something fattening, even though I haven't really danced in years.  It's odd, anyway.  But I'd like to get my weight back down a little.  Perhaps once I get back up to school it will be easier.    I also haven't done a lick of research.  I need to come up with a topic to write about in a paper for next semester, and so far I've done no work on it.  Oh well.  Perhaps I will find a sudden burst of committedness.  Meanwhile, I think I've got more Minesweeper to play and more Harry Potter to read...  Busy showing the world that when I've got nothing to do, I am really quite lazy...

      Christmas has come and gone, and now the real depression sets in.  I must confess that New Year's Eve is probably my least favorite day of the year.  And every year when Christmas is over, I start to prepare myself for the year end specials that remind us how quickly time passes and how much from the previous year we could actually forget had happened until we are reminded by the cable news channels.  I usually try to occupy my time that evening somehow, which is hard for someone like me, who isn't into drinking or partying.  But as long as the sickies have the hold of me, perhaps I can just sleep through it all.

      Ugh.  I have been battling an impending sickness, which is why I have been an absentee blogger the past couple of days.  But I did have a very nice Christmas.  The day after was a nice adventure as well:  shopping, waiting in Wendy's for over 30 minutes for service because of computer problems - this is why, incidentially, even though computers grow in importance nearly by the second, computers will never take over the world - and seeing the new, and last, installment of Lord of the Rings.  It was good, but I'd still say The Two Towers was the best one.

           And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.      For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.      And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.      And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,      Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.  ~Luke 2:10-14  Merry Christmas everyone!

      It's Christmas Eve.  Things are looking up.  Christmas Eve is my favorite day of the whole year.  I hope that everyone out there has finished their shopping and can avoid going out.  It's a madhouse out there, or it's going to be.  But this is a good day.  It will be a good day.  It can't help but be.

      I have finally finished my Christmas shopping.  A day of fun filled shopping just passed, and tomorrow will be a day of wrapping and taking it easy.  I just don't have that Christmas feeling yet.  Hopefully, tomorrow it will come.  If not, then I guess it never will.  Part of it is surely the weather.  It is very warm here.  Today it was colder, but it was also rainy, which is enough to bring out the "Bah, humbug" in anyone when you are out in it going from store to store.  I think I was actually pretty creative with the gifts this year, which is good.  Normally I am at a loss for things to buy.  Perhaps seeing the happy looks on the faces of those who I have bought for will do it for me.  This is always my favorite part of Christmas; it is the one way in which I am un-selfish.  Speaking of self destructive behavior...the eating continued today.  I felt so sick after my Coke Float that I had to lie down.  I am straining to fit in my jeans.  This is truly what Christmas means to be right now...No wonder I'm a little down...Now I'm off to eat some more...

      I am really tired.  I can't understand it, but ever since I got home I've been dragging, regardless of how much sleep I've been getting.  I haven't been getting a lot of sleep, but every morning I keep waking up, knot in my stomach, and even though I'm still really tired I cannot get back to sleep.  I had thought the knot would go away after the end of the semester, but it is still there.  I am always nervous about something, and I just can't get rid of the feeling.  I am beginning to thing there is something wrong with me...Then again, perhaps it is just post-semester confusion - I don't know what to do with myself.

      Cyberspace seems to have eaten my last post, for as soon as I posted it, it disappeared.  I shall try to recreate it as best I can, though I'm sure something entirely different will be put forth instead...  I have had a remarkably lazy day.  Nothing has been accomplished.  Mostly I've just eaten a lot.  I really should stop eating.  My mother, who is at least five inches taller than me, now weighs less than I do, wears small clothes than me...you get the picture.  It's borders on shameful.  But what do I do:  I keep right on eating. And then there's my sister and her boyfriend.  I have never been fond of change, especially the type that feel so permanent, and that is how this feels.  She told me they are getting married.  Not anytime soon, but still.  It got me thinking.  I am the one mature enough to handle such an undertaking, such a relationship, and yet I remain worthlessly and hopelessly alone.  But it isn't jealously that I feel.  It's anger.  Change is bad.  This is probably why I cling so desperately to my conservatism; contrary to the old adage, change is not always good, and is quite potentially disastrous.  Suddenly, everything is different.  People you thought you knew become inseparable from people you don't know or don't care to know.  They put up a wall, that no one can reach over.  There's a door, but only one person has the key, and it isn't you.  They don't understand your upset and confusion, for they are in love.  And when they say "We'll do something soon," they mean you, them, and some other entity, for great lovers must never be apart.  And you bite your tongue, and you want to scream, because something isn't right, this isn't right.  It's a mistake and it isn't fair and you just want to bang heads together.  Perhaps it is jealousy after all.

      And the accent returneth.  It's very strange, but every time I come home, my southern accent returns in full force, generally worse than it was when I lived here regularly.  Then, as soon as I get back to New York, I talk like one of them yankees.  Very strange indeed.  I think I just tend to mimic those around me, and pick up on their mannerisms, speech patterns, and even accents I guess.  But it is really funny to hear myself talk down here as opposed to up there.

      Andrew Sullivan provides  urlLink an analysis  of the varied view of conservatives on the proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, showing that not all conservatives are raving lunatics.  As a fairly conservative person myself, I find it appalling that there is so much support for this among people who call themselves conservatives.  It is not a conservative position, and the constitution should not be amended on a whim.  I do hope the President will take some effective domestic leadership and steer us away from this madness.  There are more important battles to be fought.

      I'm home.  And home is indeed a wonderful place.  It has been so nice, so far, my break.  Normally, I am never quite sure what to do with myself.  But I have managed to keep pretty busy, what with flying and helping my mother out with her performances of The Nutcracker.  The show was very beautiful.  Well, at least what I saw of it.  It is hard for me to watch ballet, especially this particular ballet and this particular production of it, because I am so intimately familiar with the music and the choreography and everything about it.  It makes me realize that when I quit dance, I probably made the biggest mistake of my life.  It was the one thing I ever did that made me completely happy, and it was the one thing I did that I was the best at, and could have been great at, and the one thing I always and ever wanted to excel at doing.  But it was scary, the thought of failure, because it was also the hardest thing I've ever done, and the risk of failure was great.  So I gave it up for something easier.  It's one of the reasons I think I ended up going to law school.  I had to prove to myself I had the guts to do something hard.  But even this was the safer decision - for me, getting a job would have been much harder.  But here I am, probably a better person for it.    Anyway, enough moaning.  It's Christmas.  Today is a little bit of shopping.  I've pretty much finished my shopping, so it will mainly just be for fun, to get me out and about and in the Christmas spirit.  It's a balmy 65 degrees here in Mississippi this fine day.  And I'm going to enjoy all of it while I can.

Perhaps I will return tomorrow evening.  If not, look for me on Sunday.    I will try to blog as much as I can from home, but given the difficulty in having to be at my at my father's mercy for the computer.  But we shall see....  Until then, take it easy...

      There are things in life that I am never going to understand, and I have resigned myself to a fate of being in perpetual confusion.  But alas, sometimes it still befuddles me the things that go on in this crazy world.   Par example , (I thought about saying "to wit" but didn't want to sound too much like a philosopher) there are rumblings of noisy maintenance in the library.  Now, I realize that it is the last day of exams, but considering that every 1L & 2L has an exam today (this representing over 2/3 of the school because the 1L class is huge), it does not seem unreasonable to assume that it should be quiet up here, epsecially since 2 is supposed to be one of the quieter floors.  A little noise I could understand...I mean, maintenance doesn't stop just because exams are in full gear...and most of the maintenance people here at St. John's are very courteous.  So perhaps I'll cut the guys behind me a break, in the holiday spirit and all.  As for the students...People seem to think that if you talk really loudly by the elevators that no one else on the floor can hear you.  Well, I'm here to tell them that they are sadly mistaken in their delusions.  I wish all of you could be here to see the layout of the 2nd floor so I could prove my point.  So for now you'll just have to take my word for it.   I'm so glad the semester is coming to an end...Whew.

      1 & 1/2 hours until the beginning of the end.  I feel pretty comfortable with the material for this exam, but I have no idea how I am actually going to do.  I mainly just can't wait for it to be over.  It seems like this exam period has been really long.  But soon (tomorrow) I will be wisking my way home on the wings of angels (and Northwest Airlines) to holiday merriment and relaxing fun.  You will not recognize the person I will be over the next couple of weeks.  Cherish the time you have to be yourself while you can, I say.  It may not soon return.

      Courtsey of Mike:  On this date, in 1882, The Nutcracker premiered in Russia.  In this spirit, I would highly recommend that everyone get out there this holiday season and see some production of this ballet.  Chances are you won't have to go very far to find one.  And, if you can, try and support a local dance group.  My mother runs one herself in Gulfport, MS, and it is a daunting thing to undertake, and very very expensive, so support your local arts community, especially your local ballet.

       urlLink The Golden Globe nominations for 2004  are out.  Normally, movies used to be a much bigger part of my life, and I used to have seen everything - at the very least I wanted to see it and was barred from doing so by virtue of living in Mississippi.  Ironically, I had to come to New York to lose touch with film.  I've seen a few of these movies, and there are a few more that I want to see.  And I've heard of most of them, so I suppose that is an encouraging sign.

I will have more to say on the substance of these decisions later - during the break when I have more time to devote to understanding it.

      Law related movie of the day, because it's nice to remember that law and law school are not synonomous:   Inherit the Wind .  Okay, so it may not very much resemble an actual trial that you are likely to see anywhere.  But there is some wonderful acting in the grand old style of over-the-top theatrics, and it is at least based on actual events (The Scopes Monkey Trial), so it does have a modicum of reality about it, even if the courtroom dramatics are pure theater.  The movie does play a bit like a filmed play rather than a film in its own right, but I think this is because most of the action takes place in the courtroom.  And check out Gene Kelly in a decidedly and unabashedly un-musical and generally strange- but not altogether terrible - performance as a cynical and caustic journalist in the style of H.L. Mencken.    The title of the film comes from Proverbs 11:29, quoted by Spencer Tracy (in the Clarence Darrow role) at the end of the film:  "He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart."

That should tell you everything you need to know. But never mind those keys to Scripture: This intelligent homosexual can tell you the difference between socialism and capitalism in two sentences, thus saving you three-plus hours of excruciating agitprop. (No need to thank me, gentle reader.) Under socialism, we Gays are usually led to a field and shot dead. Under capitalism, we design clothes and decorate houses. Which would you choose?"

      Sorry I've been MIA for the past couple of days, but between exams and getting sick I have not had the time or energy or ability to post very much.  But I'm back!  There are so many things I want to talk about, but I'm just going to have to limit myself a little bit longer.  So I'll just do the highlights:  Sunday:  Saddam was captured.  If anyone missed this, then I pity you and your little oblivious self.  I don't know how big this is, politically speaking.  I mean, I don't know how much it changes, because I think Bush was pretty much unbeatable before.  This certainly doesn't help the Democrats in general, though I think it might help some and hurt others, though it is really too early to tell how all the reactions will pan out.  Apparently, Dean believes that capturing Saddam does not make the U.S. safer.  And maybe he is right.  But the other Democrats, particularly Lieberman, Kerry, and Gephardt have jumped on these comments.  So only time will tell who it helps and who it hurts.  It should be interesting to see what happens in New Hampshire next month, to see if the Dean magic starts to slip away.  As for me, I'd like to see it help Lieberman, as he's the only Democrat I'd consider voting for out of this crew.  Also on Sunday was the Great Con Law Review.  It was fun.  No, really, it was.  Monday:  The sickness came over me.  Didn't get as much studying done as I should have.  Was very lazy.  Tuesday:  The Torts final.  Thankful that it is over, but wish it had been a wee bit easier...oh yes, and more than that I wish I'd been taught something by the professor to help me on the exam.  But perhaps this is asking too much.  The evening was much better.  I got to hang out with cool friends and eat food that was really bad for me - well, I always eat food that is really bad for me, but the cool friends thing was nice.  Then, I wimped out on them, got lazy, and went home to watch hours on end of TV, the highlight of which was "24."  I can't say enough good things about this show.  I missed it last week, which was very disappointing because a lot happened - luckily I know cool people who were willing to take the time to fill me in - but this week was really good also.  I only started watching it this season (over the break I hope to be able to watch the first two seasons on DVD), but so far, I really like what I've seen.    I swear there are few things better than good television.  Maybe good gin.  And good food. And good friends, of course.  All four, and I'd think I'd died and gone to heaven.  There's all the latest.  Now, back to work.  But never fear...I shall return.  And sooner than you'd think or want.

       urlLink Interesting news  out of Europe.  I'm not sure how I feel about the "ever closer union" that is the EU.  On the one hand, I am not with my Grandfather who feels it is the start of the New World Order.  But this statement by Gerhard Schroder is interesting:   "We don't have a consensus on a constitution here because one or another country put the European ideal behind national interest."   This may all be well enough, but to imply that his sole motivation is the furtherment of the "European ideal," as some abstract concept that has no connection to what his country stands to gain from that ideal is somewhat disingenuous.  In other words, he is sitting on the largest economy in Europe, and given that the EU started as a economic organization, any furhter integration is surely in Germany's national interest.  And aren't the elected leaders of a country supposed to act in that country's best interest, and isn't that interest  necessarily and inherently  national?  I think Tony Blair (not surprisingly), gets closer to being honest, and right, when he says:   "It is in my view entirely sensible that we take the time to get it right.  To look at this in sort of apocalyptic terms is, I think, rather misguided."   It is interesting, though, that Europe should be having a problem that is so American, that is the balancing of local and federal interests.  Though I guess in the case of Europe this should be national and supra-national interests.  But it is something that the United States dealt with over 200 years ago, not to mention fought a civil war over, so let's hope the resolution to this "crisis" proves less bloody (not that I expect it will be anything close to bloody), especially considering that the reason the EU was started was to prevent further wars among the European powers by so inter-linking their economic interests as to render it impossible for them to go to war with one another.    And it seems largely to have worked; never have France and Germany been so close, though it is not only their economic interests that unites them.

      Where are you? I haven't seen you in such a long while I have been too busy to look for you Or even think about you Except to glance for you when I pass a place you normally inhabit. But I haven't seen you When normally I don't have to try to see you When normally you just appear Like the last time I saw you When I nearly ran into you As you were entering and I was exiting When I saw you then, I didn't feel The shock to the heart, followed by the pang of overwhelming sadness That I usually feel when I see your face. If I hadn't come face to face with you I might not have noticed you at all. So perhaps I have seen you and didn't realize, Becoming more like you. But still, I wonder where you've been, So maybe not.

      Question of the day:  what piece of music comes to mind when you think of  Barry Lyndon ? I mean the movie of course; I've been meaning to read the novel for a while, ever since a friend of mine bought it for me, but a little thing called law school has gotten in the way, and before that it was just sheer laziness.  (As an aside: if you have not seen  Barry Lyndon  or have no idea what I am talking about, it's a film directed by Stanley Kubrick and it's great and everybody out there should see it, if for no other reason than it is one of the few good films that Ryan O'Neal ever made.)    Anyway, I suspect most people think of the music that plays during the duel scene toward the end.  Forgive my ignorance of the title of the piece or who composed it.  But whenever I think of the film, the first piece that comes to mind is the Schubert piano piece that plays when Barry is seducing Lady Lyndon.  I guess it's because that scene is, to me, more evocative of the mood of the film, with the candlelight and all.  The film was shot with no artificial light, don't you know?

      I'm dragging today.  I just can't seem to get motivated, and I still have two more finals to study and prepare for.  I keep telling myself the worst is over, but I'm not sure that is the case since I have to learn an entire class in three days.  But it will all be over soon, and then I will be going home for Christmas.   So as long as I keep the end in sight, I should be fine.

      I have a confession to make:  MY FEET STINK.  I don't mean just a little smell either.  You see, I have these dress boots that are too big for me, so I have these big socks that I have to wear with them, and I've been wearing them a lot lately because I bought some new clothes and I don't have that many shoes I can wear with them and I've been a little lax in my laundry duties...Anyway, so I took them off last night and all I can say about the smell is...Wow, it was really bad.  I mean rank, putrid, the worst of the worst smells.  Anyway, I just felt like sharing that, as a warning for the future...don't get too close to my bare, stinky feet.  The smell could be lethal.

Yes, I have an exam on Friday  night ; that is St. John's School of Law, the school I love so dearly.

      Here's the latest from the Supreme Court:   urlLink McCain-Feingold has been upheld .  I haven't had time to read the court's opinion, but I do not suspect this is the big deal that it seems at first glance, though only history will tell.  I suppose it is important as a statement, but I don't think it's going to drastically change the way campaigns are run in this country, and it will only be a matter of time before the politicians find loopholes.  That said, I think it is generally a good thing.  And perhaps I will turn out to be wrong about it's relative importance.

      I've been hearing the name "Robert Ford" lately, and it got me thinking:  Who the heck is Robert Ford?  So I did a little investigation (taking a little break from studying), and I find out that he was none other than the man who killed Jesse James.  I found  urlLink what appears to be a review of a book about this event , and I find the last paragraph particularly compelling, where he contrasts Jesse James and Robert Ford as representative of the two different centuries while living on the cusp, though I do not know enough about the specific history of these two men to champion its validity.    It did get me thinking about something which is a nice segue into something else I wanted to do, which is make a movie recommendation:   urlLink Once Upon a Time in the West .  Yes it's long, and yes it's dubbed, but this is an wonderful, monstrous epic film about the death of the old West and the rise of the Modern era, symbolized by the coming of the railroads and the capitalists.  And if this doesn't exactly do it for you, it's got Henry Fonda, one of the nicest looking men ever to grace the face of the earth, looking quite rugged and quite evil staring out of those steely blue eyes.  Oh yes, and one more thing:  make sure you see it Widescreen, or else you'll miss the best thing about the film, which is it's style and beauty.  They say looks aren't everything, but I think with film, looks are almost everything.  If a film looks good, so much else can be forgiven.  And this film looks great.  It's very nearly perfect.  And it just  urlLink came out on DVD , so there are no excuses.

      I really think people have started to go a little crazy from being couped up in the library, or else it's all the studying that it driving them insane--though it does seem to be a little early in the exam period for that.  It's like Romper Room in here.  A minute ago I heard the pitter pat of feet pounding on the floor, running, and then I see these two guys emerge from behind the bookshelves, and what do you suppose they are doing--you guessed it, play-wrestling with each other.  Then, I'm trying to walk down the aisle to get back to my desk, and there is this crowd of people around one of the carrels, a girl is sitting on the floor blocking up the aisle...and they are all TALKING VERY LOUDLY.  There are these little things called exams preoccupying everyone at the present, so you'd think that all these people would have something better to do.  I mean, I'm not exactly studying at the moment, but I am not disrupting those who are trying to either.  Ah,  c'est la vie , I suppose.  Sometimes I wonder if people are really worth all the trouble...

      He's back.  And  urlLink this one's  a beaut; here's former VP Al Gore on the Iraq War:  "That war is not a minor matter to me.  I realize it's only one of the issues, but my friends, this nation has never, in two centuries and more, made a worse foreign policy mistake."    Now, regardless of where you stand on the U.S. involvement in Iraq, surely most of us can see that IT IS NOT EVEN OVER YET, so perhaps it is too soon to be jumping to conclusions.  Oh, and...ahem...can anybody say "Vietnam."  I don't think this war is quite to the Vietnam stage; it may get there--I don't happen to think it will, but it is a subject on which there can be valid disagreement--but I don't think we're there yet.  And I think it is a strange, and potentially dangerous thing, to make historical judgments about a given event when we are still deep in the midst of it.    That, and he should have said "in two centuries and change," because it just sounds cooler.

      I've been meaning to post this for a while, written by the always enigmatic and sharp Christopher Hitchens, since it is the most  urlLink sane thing written about the Kennedys  that I've read in a long time.  I may not always agree with Hitchens, but he is one of the most thoughtful and intelligent and biting writers I have ever come across.  He really cuts through it all and gets to the point, and doesn't constantly take knee-jerk reactions to things based on his politics.  For more stuff written by him, go to  urlLink The Christopher Hitchens Web .  As for the Kennedy mystique, I'm not sure it's totally gone yet, but I did notice that on the 40th anneversary of the assassination that just passed last month, there were some serious revisionist documentaries on TV, not the fawning fare of the past.  And I suspect as we get even further removed from the 60s, this trend will probably continue.  Perhaps, one day, we as Americans will even be able to let the 60s go.

      In conducting a Google search for lyrics for David Bowie's "Rock 'n' Roll Suicide," I came across  urlLink this .  As I started reading it, I thought, "wow, I don't know this song as well as I thought I did, because I had no idea this is what he was saying."  Then, I did some investigation, and discovered that this site,  urlLink Crazy Lyrics , claims to contain lyrics translated from English into some other language and back into English again, though I leave it to you to decide whether or not it is a joke, as I tend to think it is.  Some people seem to be very offended by this (check out  urlLink the Guestbook  on this guy's site), but I think it is just harmless fun.  Some of the "alternate" lyrics are very entertaining, especially from songs that do not make much sense to begin with.

Actually, and more accurately, I am missing it as I type this, and I am far away from home, so there is no chance of me getting home in time to catch even part of it.  Couple this with my lack of VCR possession at the moment, and we have the makings of a real modern American tragedy,  n'est-ce pas ?  Oh well, I shall have to muddle through somehow, and content myself with being informed by my friends of what happened without getting to visually partake in it myself.  Sigh.

      Sorry there were no posts this weekend, but it was the weekend from hell.  First of all, the snow.  There was just so much snow.  I braved the snow to come all the way out here to school, only to discover that the internet was down.  So I bravely treked back home.  Just one more word about the snow, before I let it go, because it is a sunny and beautiful, albeit slightly cold, day here today:  I think snow is evil, sent by the Devil himself, to lure hapless sinners into thinking that the heat and damnation of Hell might not be so bad after all.  Then, there was the other big crisis of the weekend.  I nearly lost a very important file, i.e. the much talked about tax outline.  Yes, I know I should back up my files, and normally I do, but I've been very busy and have neglected this duty.  And so I flew into a panic.  But all is well now.  My father calmed me down over the phone, and gave me some very helpful suggestions.  It turned out that the file was not corrupted after all, I was just having trouble opening it with Word on MY computer, but it opened elsewhere fine.  I copied and repasted it into a new document, dubbing it "New Tax Outline" and the world as I know it was saved.  The moral of this story:  there is a God, and he is merciful at times, even to an ungrateful sinner like myself.   I have a final today, so things might be a little slow going here on the blog.  I will try and post things if I can, but otherwise, I will be cramming little bits of information into my brain as best I can before 6:30 tonight.

      IT'S STILL SNOWING!!!  At least I think it is.  It's starting to get dark so it's hard to tell, but looking up at the lights outside, I can still see drifts of snow floating through the air.  I'm sorry to keep harping on the snow, but I am starting to get a little worried about the commute home tonight.  It should be fine though...my bus is on a main road that I'm sure is being kept clear, but still...it's cold and icky out and I'm going to have to stand and wait for the bus.

      Okay, my initial feelings of nostalgia and comfort upon seeing the snow falling this morning have quickly wasted away.  I'm sitting here at school, and it is still falling, and a lot of it is falling, and it is all sticking to the ground.  It wasn't supposed to be this much snow, and I am not looking forward to trying to commute back into the city through it.  But hey, it could always be worse.  And it does look awfully beautiful, as I stare out the window at it falling from my safe and warm spot in the library...when I really should be studying.  And eventually it will stop....right?

      It's snowing here in New York this morning.  Anyone who knows me has probably heard me complain about the impending snow, but my sad little Mississippi heart really does like the snow, and I always feel a little bit lighter, if a little bit colder, with the first snow of the year.  To me, snow actually brightens the day.  And I don't mean in the figurative sense; snow literally brightens the day.  When it snows, the sky is usually cloudy and dark.  But the snow is white, and it reflects the limited light available.  So it's brighter.    Some of you are probably thinking that it's amazing, and somewhat scary, to see how my mind works.  So I guess I'll just say stay warm, wherever you are...and depending on where you are, it might be easier or harder.

Or at least I think I saw him. I caught a glipse Across the way And the person I saw had the feel of him But I didn't investigate So I don't know. I was strong. I kept on walking, even though I really wanted to know And carried myself far away Where I couldn't see And stare And wish And cry. And I managed to forget completely about him.

      A friend of mine from college just paid me a great compliment: she told me that she admired me for going to law school.  It's kind of funny.  First of all, it made me feel a lot better about myself on a day when I really need that, so praise the Lord for that.  Second of all, it made me think, because I never really thought of my decision to come to law school as admirable, or anything close to it.  To me, it was the easiest choice to make at the time.  I always thought it was a bit of a cop out for me to come straight to law school from college, without even trying to make it in the real world.  I always felt like I was running away from something, deferring growing up for as long as possible.  It just goes to show that what seems like an easy or compromising decision to you can seem to be the most difficult and arduous decision to someone else.  And we don't often get to find out how other people really view us; it doesn't often come up in conversation.  I don't know what any of this means; I'm nearly delirious from lack of sleep and studying for Tax, but it just struck me as interesting.  It made me re-evaluate the way I look at myself, and made me think that maybe I should give myself the benefit of the doubt, and not assume that every decision I've ever made in my entire life was to put myself in the most comfortable situation as possible.   And it's so true, because law school may be many things, but comfortable is not one of them.

      Here is a  urlLink very interesting report  from Andrew Sullivan, who is almost always right about everything, from  The New Republic Online  on the watchcry from the left that Bush has somehow shirked his duty as Commander-in-Chief in not going to funerals for any of the soldiers who have died in the War on Terror.  He does a good job in pointing out the flaws in the argument, especially noting that this is standard practice, and that sitting Presidents usually do not attend such events, that it has even been their policy since the first Bush administration specifically to not do so.  There are plenty of things that President Bush can be criticized for, so it doesn't really behoove anyone to waste their time on the silly or misguided ones.  And these same people would be criticizing him for attending funerals, if he so chose, saying that he was only doing so in a vain and self-righteous attempt to score political points.

      Well, sometimes people surprise you.  And I don't mean in a good way.  I guess people often surprise me in a good way because I tend to assume the worst about people, and I've come to realize that most people really aren't as bad as I think humanity is.  I'm often taken aback by generosity and kindness from unlikely places.  But today, something I've been feeling about someone has been driven home to me in a bad way.  This person is normally sweet, and friendly, and now I am beginning to see the light, that all is not as innocent and supportive as it seems.  You hear stories like this about law school, about people being two-faced:  seemingly friendly and eager to help, but really deviously plotting behind your back.  But you'd think that after you've been in school for awhile, you would have figured out who those people were.  Yet they are continuing to surprise me.  And disappoint me.

      Okay, folks it's the post you've all been waiting for...well, not really, but it sounds good anyway, no?  I watched "The West Wing" last night, just like I said I would, and though I did not give it my complete attention, I do have a couple of observations to make about it.  1.  Since when is  urlLink Dylan Baker  the Attorney General?  He is one of my favorite actors, so I'm pretty sure he hasn't been on the show before.  It was pretty cool to see him actually, since he is one of my favorite actors, and I didn't expect it.  Plus, his character was somewhat adverse to the administration, which the show is in sore need of since they got rid of Tim Matheson, who used to play the Vice President before they unceremoniously (and stupidly) got rid of his character.  I hope Dylan Baker returns soon, for the show could use more of that tension.  2.  Not only was Dylan Baker on the show, but his character was from....you guessed it, Mississippi.  If you'll allow me a personal rant on this point, I find it very difficult to believe that a Democratic president, especially one as liberal as the Bartlet is on the show, would appoint someone from Mississippi as his AG.  Most people from Mississippi, particularly those who are active in politics, are just not that liberal...not even the Democrats...and the AG is one of the more political positions in the Cabinet.  And Democrats from Mississippi tend to not be that influential in national politics, precisely because they tend to trend more conservative than the party as a whole at the national level.  I'm not saying it's impossible...just highly unlikely.  Still, kudos to my home state on getting a mention on "The West Wing."  3.  Other than this, I found the episode to be sort of weak.  There were nice moments, as there always are on holiday episodes, including one between the President and the First Lady, who have been having some marital difficulties as of late.  But overall, I couldn't really figure out what was going on here.  It was very erratic.  Perhaps this was supposed to be some statement and representation of what the holidays are like for people, and what it's like to be President, but there was just too much going on, most of which didn't really bear any sort of relation to anything else going on, or anything else that has ever happened on the show.    That said, it could have been worse.  And it was a lot better than most of the episodes this season.  And it will probably be enough to get me to tune in after the holidays are over.  I've been looking for a reason to give up on this show for awhile, and they showed me enough last night to make me stick with it for just a little bit longer.  Sorry for the hopeless rant about my television show.  But I don't know anyone else who watches it regularly, so I have to vent my frustrations about it somewhere.  After all, television is life.

      Here's an interesting quiz:   urlLink What 20th Century Theorist Are You?   I don't even know who some of these people are, for which I hold the Cinema Studies department at NYU personally responsible.  But then again, the whole current course of my life is pretty much their fault.  But that's the subject of a whole other post.  Meanwhile, here are my results for the quiz...    You are Michel Foucault! You wrote groundbreaking histories of prisons, hospitals, asylums, and sex. Interestingly, you thought basically the same thing about all of them. Your historical accuracy is a bit dodgy, but that was never really the point. You were very obsessed with power roles - so obsessed that you frequented gay S&M clubs, and died of AIDS in 1984.    urlLink   What 20th Century Theorist are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    For those of you unfamiliar with Foucault, I cannot express to you how depressing it is to be compared to him.  I'm sure he was a nice person and all (well, actually, I'm not sure of that at all, but I'm willing to give anyone the benefit of the doubt), but as someone who was forced to read his dribble in college, it saddens me to be told by some silly quiz that I have some affinity with him and his theories, which, being inside my own head, I know is not the truth.  Those of you familiar with Foucault probably understand.

      It has been noted that the posts here are somewhat...well, depressing, and that my life may be lacking in a certain "joie de vivre."  Well, such is law school, especially during finals.  After December 19th, things should get decidedly less depressing, and hopefully stay that way for a while.  At least here's hoping that turns out to be the case.  Now, I should get back to work.

      I was watching "24" last night (kudos to Gary for getting me to watch the show - I love it), and it was a very good episode, very tense, with an ending taht left you hanging.  Yet I noticed as I was watching it that all of my observations concerning it were...well, silly to say the least.  For example:  I noted that the wardrobe for the show must be really easy, since the entire season takes place all in one day and nobody will be changing clothes that often.  Never mind the fact that these people are dealing with concerns of life and death and clothes are the last thing on their mind.  But I sure am thinking about it.    Wish I could remember more of my keen and witty insights.  I was watching it alone, so I didn't have anyone to share them with, so I am reporting them now.  Tonight is "The West Wing" Christmas episode, so tomorrow I should have further inane things to report.  So stay tuned.

      Just posting this as a sign of how pathetic my life has become:  I'm sitting in the library working on my tax outline (believe it or not, this is not the most pathetic part of the story), and I notice this case called  International Freighting Corporation, Inc. v. Commissioner , and I think to myself that first party's name is silly, because "corporation" is in the title, followed by "Inc." so that the name of the company is "International Freighting Corporation, Incorporated."   Pathetic, huh?  Feel free to email me and tell me to get a life.  Or better yet, send me an instant message:  NarcissistSLB.

      Well, I hope everyone had an enjoyable Thanksgiving and a relaxing weekend following it.  I took a little break myself, as I'm sure you could notice from the lack of posts.  I only have internet at school, so when I don't post, it means I am crazy busy at school, or I am not there.  This weekend, I was not there.  I decided to work from home for the break.  I was not very successful in getting a lot done, but I did spend a lot of money eating out and seeing movies.  I also watched a lot of television, especially with the Christmas season upon us, there are always really sappy holiday movies on and I manage to get sucked into every one of them.  So this was how I spent my weekend.  It wasn't all fun and games.  I did get a fair amount of work done as well, so I guess I can hold my head high today and say that the break was not a total waste.  Just would have been a lot nicer to have been wasting that time at home with my family.  Oh, well, I guess the Rolling Stones were right:  you can't always get what you want.

      I have been chastised for not posting my thoughts on the Oscars yet (well, perhaps not chastised...but let's say the conspicuous absence of said thoughts has not gone unnoticed) so I thought I'd  urlLink give the old noms a look see  and then get to it.  So here are all my thoughts on any category that means anything to me.  Special thanks to my ex-roomie and goodest (yes, I know it's not a word) friend, a.k.a. the bonnie lass from Jersey ( New  Jersey, that is) for her help in gathering my thoughts on these auspicious awards:   Best Actor :  To me, this category includes the biggest surprise of the nominations, and that is the inclusion of Johnny Depp among the ranks.  Not that he's not a wonderful actor, or he wasn't good in the movie - I myself haven't seen it, so I will refrain from commenting - but  Pirates of the Caribbean  is not the type of movie that usually gets Oscar recognition.  That said, there are always surprises, and I guess this year is no different.  I'd really like to see Sean Penn win for  Mystic River .  I think it'll be him or Bill Murray for  Lost in Translation .  Right now, I'll give Penn the edge, but sometimes controversy is something the Academy likes to avoid, so they may go with Murray in the end.   Best Supporting Actor :  Yay for Alec Baldwin.  He was great in  The Cooler , and I'd like to see him win.  But it's not going to be him.  Probably, it will go to Tim Robbins from  Mystic River .  And as he's a good actor who often goes unrecognized, I wouldn't have any problem with that at all.  The rest of these performances have gone unseen by me, so I can't comment on their desert of the nomination or the award.  Del Toro's won already (nominated here for  21 Grams ), so I'd say he won't win again, though.     Best Actress :  I've only seen one of the movies, and Diane Keaton was very good in  Something's Gotta Give , so I can't make much of a statement of who should win the award.  What's surprising is who is missing from the list.  No Nicole Kidman from  Cold Mountain , even though her co-stars Jude Law and Renee Zellweger received nods.  Also no Scarlet Johansson, who was, in my opinion, even better than Bill Murray in  Lost in Translation .  But look for Charlize Theron in  Monster  to take the award, as this is the performance of the year, if you listen to all the buzz and hype.  I haven't seen the movie, but it strikes me as one of those roles that actresses would kill for, meaty and full of Oscar potential.   Best Supporting Actress :  This award will probably go to Renee Zellweger, though I suppose, if it doesn't, it could just as well go to anyone.  It's nice to see Patricia Clarkson here.  I didn't see  Pieces of April , but she is a great actress and she deserves recognition.   Best Animated Feature :  Definitely going to go to  Finding Nemo , even though I've heard good things about both the other films, especially  The Triplets of Belleville .   Best Director :  Best thing about this category - Anthony Minghella was not nominated to  Cold Mountain .    Also, it happens every year, and this year, the odd man out is Gary Ross, who was not nominated for  Seabiscut , even though is movie received a Best Picture nod.  The Academy opted instead for  City of God  director Fernando Meirelles, backed by the Miramax machine.  As an aside, I think that Harvey Weinstein might be the anti-Christ.  At the very least, he is the Boss Tweed of his generation and of the film industry.  I'm hoping Peter Jackson wins here.    The Lord of the Rings  trilogy is an amazing achievement, as even non-fans must acknowledge, and he deserves recognition for it.     Best Picture :  Again, I have to side with  Lord of the Rings: Return of the King .  Though I do have a soft spot in my heart for  Mystic River , if for no other reason than all the Boston accents were actually really good.  As an aside, for an example of a bad Boston accent, watch the first ten minutes of Kevin Costner in  Thirteen Days .   Best Screenplay - Adapted :  I must say I find the nominations here a little weak.  Perhaps it was just a bad year for writing.  As much as I liked  Mystic River , I'm not sure I'd credit the screenplay for that as much as I would the acting and the photography.  I'd have to pick  American Splendor  here, which was easily one of the most original movies of the year.  And it also had one of my very favorite film moments of the year, in which Hope Davis' character, who has a habit of diagnosing the personality disorders of everyone she comes in contact with, dubs David Letterman a "megalomaniac."   Best Screenplay - Original :  The pickings are better here, though I haven't seen very many of them.  I'd have to side with  Lost in Translation , which bore one of my other favorite film moments of the year, namely that Japanese guy doing a karaoke version of the Sex Pistols' "God Save the Queen."  I still haven't stopped laughing at this...  So those are my thoughts...whatever they're worth.  It'll be fun to watch the Oscars on Feburary 29 to see who wins.  My thoughts might change if I see more movies between now and then.  And look for my post-Oscar night rant.  There's always something that upsets me, and I'm sure this year will be no exception.

      For the second Presidential election in a row, I took  urlLink this quiz  to ascertain my political match for the 2004 election.  My results were unsurprising:  Lieberman - 100%, Bush - 98%, Kerry - 96%, Edwards - 90%, Clark - 89%, Dean - 88%, Sharpton - 87%, Kucinich - 66%.  If the Democrats were smart enough to nominate Lieberman, I'd vote for him in a second.  Don't know that I will vote for Bush, no matter who the guy running against him is.  I may have to go third party again, if it's between Kerry and Bush.  But we shall see.  It's a ways off, and a lot can happen before the end.

      I was in a good mood today.  I went out to school to put in some time at the Journal helping out, and I ran into one of the Journal members when I stopped to eat lunch.  And she asked me why I was so smiley.  And I didn't have an answer, but as I thought of it, I realized that I was indeed in a good mood.  It wasn't something that had occurred to me straight away, though, that I was in a good mood.  But when my attention was called to it, I realized that I was.  I was happy, and smiling.  And I started to wonder why.  And though I could think of many reasons, e.g. getting the internet set up at home, the wonderful book I am reading, the fact that I'd just seen a good movie the day before...none of these reasons seemed particularly satisfactory.  I guess it's just as hard for me to figure out why I'm in a good mood as it is to figure out why I'm in a bad mood.    And I guess that's the way it should be.

      Okay, I had kind of a strange experience today.  I went to see  urlLink  The Cooler   this afternoon (yes, I was at a movie at 4:30 on a Thursday afternoon - as one reader of this blog  urlLink commented once , and her blog can be found  urlLink here  as well as in the links at the side denoted Crossing the Rubicon, this really is the best time of my life), and none other than Mr. Mike Wallace was in the audience.  So my friend is the one who notices him first, so she looks over and tells me, so I glance over all casual and stuff and I see that it really is him.  Except, in some strange way, it doesn't look like him.  And I can't figure out why.  But there's this nagging thought in the back of my head, like he should be taller or he should look different.  Then, it hits me:  I've seen  urlLink  The Insider   so many times that whenever I think of Mike Wallace, I picture  urlLink Christopher Plummer , who plays him in the movie.  Just goes to show, that sometimes movies can become reality in your head, until reality smacks you on the head, that is.  Anyway,  The Cooler  was good.  I really liked it.  Never been a huge Alec Baldwin fan, though he is great in  Glengarry Glen Ross .  But I'd say he gave one of the better performances I've ever seen him give, as well as one of the best of the year.  And William H. Macy is great, but he's always great, and I usually like him, so that was less of a surprise.  I highly recommend it.

      Been tired and busy, too busy to update.  My thoughts on the Oscar nominations will be forthcoming though.  Never fear.  I'm going to see one of the movies that received a couple of nominations today, so I wanted to hold off on my thoughts until I see it, since my whole analysis may change.  So there.  Otherwise, I'm just sitting here in the library, occasionally doing work and trying not to fall asleep.

      Check this out for  urlLink why I will not be voting for John Kerry .  I think Kerry makes a valid point.  It is true enough that if Al Gore had turned his attentions to states other than those in the South, he might gotten the electoral votes necessary to win the Presidency.  But Kerry seems to be forgetting that part of Gore's strategy in going after some of the states in the South that he did (Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana) was that Bill Clinton had been able to win them in  urlLink 1992  and  urlLink 1996 .  This is hardly ancient history.  Gore's problem in the South was not that he decided to campaign in these areas; it was that he was perceived not as from there and not as reflecting the ideals those voters were looking for, unlike Bill Clinton.  Gore tried to distance himself from Clinton, who was still an emmensly popular figure, and it was this that hurt him.   I think that Kerry is right:  the general trend in the South has been away from the Democrats and toward the Republicans.  But I think we'll need to see a couple of more election cycles before we completely write off Democratic hopefuls from winning the South.  If, say, the Democrats were to nominate John Edwards, I think a few states in the South would probably follow, and probably not at the expense of too many Northeastern states who would decide to vote against the Democrat - after all, who else are they going to support?  Mainly, what bothers me about this is not that he's said it or acknowledged it, because in certain respects he is most certainly stating aloud what many have thought or implied for a while.  But what is vaguely offensive is the rhetoric he employs.  He says:   "Everybody always makes the mistake of looking South...Al Gore proved he could have been President of the United States without winning one Southern state, including his own."   This is insulting language that seems to imply that, to him, the South doesn't matter.  And perhaps the South does not, or even should not, matter to John Kerry, for if he is to be President, he will likely have to become so without the support of a single Southern state (discounting Florida - mainly because it's not really Southern at all), because he is certainly not the type of Democrat the South will go for.  In other words, he is not Bill Clinton.  And while I normally find that to be a good thing, I think here it is not.  For he writes off an entire region of the country because it will not be supporting him in his bid for the Presidency.  And while that may be realistic of him, it certainly isn't very Presidential.

      Here's Shannon's confession time, where she pours her soul out and admits that she was wrong about something.  For those of you who don't know me, this is indeed a rare occurence and something of a treat.  I'm only doing it now because I wasn't completely wrong, just somewhat.  And now, I hang my head in shame, as I admit that I saw Cold Mountain and I actually liked it.  Not all of it, but it definitely had some good qualities that I am perfectly willing to admit, and ultimately, it wasn't half bad.  At the very least, it wasn't boring, which was my biggest fear going in.  It was long, but it didn't seem interminable.  It's not destined to become one of my absolute favorites, but I didn't hate it, as I expected I would.  And the Southern accents, while annoying, were not unbearable.  I've heard much worse.  So that's my tentative approval of the film.  So I release you all to go see it if you feel you must.

      Okay, it's officially Sunday (though I'm asking them to double-check on this for me, since I could use the extra day), and I've officially not gotten anything done.  Unless one counts watching Match Game on the Game Show Network.  Interestingly enough, I was watching this last night (actually very early this morning) and there was this woman on there from my hometown.  I wish I could remember her name.  But when they each did their little bios of themselves that they give at the beginning, she introduced herself as being 23 years old, and just as I was thinking how this was odd, because I am also 23, she then introduced herself as being from Gulfport, Mississippi.  And I thought...wow.  Of course, this episode was over 20 years old, so she'd be my mother's age now, but still it would have been cool if I could have caught or remembered her name, since you never know...

      On the lighter side...well maybe not so light, considering this is my future profession we are talking about, but...How great is the American hatred of lawyers?  Well, I was watching The Game Show Network the other day (yes, I know – I have no life), and one of those game shows that cropped up after Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and was popular for about 2 seconds was on, called The Weakest Link.  Anyway, for those who don’t remember the premise of the show, it’s like a game show that meets reality television.  They start with a certain number of contestants who perform together as a team, answering questions and banking money that will carry over to the next round.  At the end of each round, however, this harmony is disrupted by allowing the players to vote one of their teammates off of the show.  When I was watching it the other day, the guy voted off first was selected by nearly everyone, even though he was the strongest link, meaning he answered the most questions right and banked the most money.  When the host asked why various members chose to eliminate him, even though he had performed well, the answer given unanimously was that they hated lawyers.

      Okay, guys, I'm going to put it to you plain.  My mother is sick.  She is in the hospital; she is way back in Gulfport, Mississippi, and I am way up here in New York, and it's driving me crazy not to be there for it.  It's a serious thing; she's going to be there all week, and she's been subjected to all kinds of tests, and they still can't figure out exactly what is causing what's wrong with her.  She's sick, and I'm scared.  She's my mother, the person who is supposed to take care of me, and she is way too young for something like this to be happening to her.  And I can't get by without her, at least not anytime soon.  I know there comes a time when we have to say goodbye to our parents, but we never want it to come, and this is certainly not the time.  I still have so much more to learn from her, so many more days to spend with her, to get to know her better, and to see our relationship grow.    Anyway, if you're prone to praying, then throw a little one her way.  Her name is Cheryl Black, and she's an amazing woman who gives so much and gets little in return, but none of that even matters, because no one deserves this.  I mean, she is going to be fine, at least for the semi-immediate future, this much I know.  The prayers are more for getting her to take better care of herself, to get her to quit smoking, and to keep her alert to things like this when they happen in the future, so that she will be able to catch them before they get too bad.  She wasn't even going to go to the hospital when this whole thing began.  My father made her go, and in doing so, he saved her life.  The prayers are that next time he won't have to, that she'll be willing and able to do it herself.

      Feeling better about my grades after talking to friends.  Friends really are a gift from God, and all of them should be cherished along with life itself.  So, thanks for making me feel better, guys, and taking my mind off things.  You know who you are.  Speaking of, it seems permissble in the North to refer to both genders with the term "guys."  But it is not so in the South.  I guess it's just a language thing, as most people down there say "ya'll."  But when I used to say "guys" referring to my friends both of the male and female persuasion, someone would invariably correct me, saying:  "I'm not a guy; I'm a girl."  On days when I miss the South, I try to remember things like this, just to keep it all in perspective.  I still miss it, but my nostalgia becomes tempered with reality.  Sorry for the digression, but such is the way my mind works.  Speaking of work, back to it I go.

      This was kind of a fun quiz to take, and I think the description is interesting & accurate:    You are Form 5,  Dragon : The Weaver.   "And The Dragon seperated the virtuous from the sinful.  He tore his eyes from his sockets and used them to peer into the souls of those on trial to make a judgement.  He knew that with endless knowledge came endless responsibility."   Some examples of the Dragon Form are Athena (Greek), St. Peter (Christian), and Surya (Indian). The Dragon is associated with the concept of intelligence, the number 5, and the element of wood. His sign is the crescent moon.  As a member of Form 5, you are an intelligent and wise individual.  You weigh options by looking at how logical they are and you know that while there may not always be a right or wrong choice, there is always a logical one.  People may say you are too indecisive, but it's only because you want to do what's right.  Dragons are the best friends to have because they're willing to learn.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I've just been told that the movie  Cold Mountain  was filmed in Romania.  Perhaps it is untrue, but it is from a most reliable friend of mine who I am sure put some investigation into the matter before telling me.  This is the final straw for me.  I was on the fence about seeing the movie, though the oddity of the casting had lead me to lean against.  But still, there is a lot of buzz and some good reviews for it out there, so I was being pulled in the other way, part of me willing and trying to give it a chance.  This, though, coupled with the fact that it is directed by Anthony Minghella - a man that I have never quite forgiven for  The English Patient  - has planted me firmly in the "no see" camp.  This is doubly true now that I am back in New York; I will not pay $10 to see this movie.    What is the problem with filming it in Romania, you ask?  The movie is supposed to take place in the United States, particularly the South.  There are plenty of places to film in order to make it look realistic.  Hell, filming it on a studio backlot would make it look more realistic than filming in Romania, which I'm quite sure looks nothing like it does here.  It doesn't look like the South at any rate.    The casting is another frustrating problem for me.  I mean nothing against Nicole Kidman or Jude Law:  I think both of them are excellent actors.  But I'm not sure either one of them have proven adept enough at something that is very hard to do, and that is accents.  Sure, they have had different accents in movies and it has been okay.  But the Southern accent is one of the more difficult ones out there to make sound convincing.  I have not seen the movie, so I suppose I shouldn't complain, but I did see the trailer, and I do believe that the accents sounded slightly forced in that forum.  Then again, very few movies even attempt to get the Southern accent right, and even when actual Southerners are cast, they seem to be doing a caricature of their own accent rather than a true one.    Then again, Vivien Leigh and Leslie Howard were British...Perhaps I just like to have something to complain about.  Maybe the accents just seem fake because I already know that isn't how they really talk and I am that much more ready to judge them.  And then you really do run across people in the South who do talk like that.  So I'm done with my rant now, and I am sorry to waste everyone's time.  The main reason I won't see the movie is that it looks like an awful bore to me, and I have seldom been impressed with the director's work, though I did rather like  The Talented Mr. Ripley .

      Okay, so I was bad and didn't post yesterday, but it isn't my fault.  I was planning on coming to school, even though I don't have class on Thursdays.  But the school was closed.  Which is sad, in a way, because I was trapped at home with nothing to do, because all of my books were in my cold and lonely locker in Queens.  Don't feel too bad for me though.  It was a nice relaxing day.  I did grocery shopping and sat around watching a lot of TV.  But I was going to be one of the few people I know who got a five day weekend this weekend, but now everybody seems to have gotten one due to the cancellation of classes yesterday.  Wouldn't you know they would cancel class on the one day I don't have it?  So I am no longer special this weekend.  But I am at school now, doing research and reading for next week.  Have fun, and stay warm if you live in the Northeast.  It is cold out there, folks.  My face is chapped from the wind and the cold.

      It's funny because I like to think of this as an accurate portrait of what is going on in my mind, but there are, of course, so many things going on in one's mind that it is impossible to duplicate, at least impossible to do so in a way other humans might understand.  I have a feeling that if it could be done, it would be complex beyond all reason and hope of understanding it, as we cannot even fathom our own minds, how are we to fathom anyone else's?  As for this page, stuff that I think and feel gets left out and discarded all the time.  Even things I can open up, things I could mention, fall by the wayside, either because of embarrassment or neglect or forgetfulness.  Makes me wonder what the point is...But this is, at least, a very therapeutic experience, for which I am grateful.  My best friend and former roommate was both my confidant and shrink, and since I do not live with her anymore, I have become seriously less well adjusted.  So perhaps this forum is helping...  Or maybe not, because when I write, I tend to focus on the negative, which is good, because I get it out somehow, but is bad, because it presents a lopsided picture of who I am and what I feel.  But I guess I can't worry about that...I only have myself to worry about, and here, we're doing just fine!

      Busy morning.  Getting a lot done, or at least it feels like it.  Do you ever feel a great sense of acomplishment upon completing a few tasks?  I usually do.  I think it has something to do with procrastination.  I put things off, so when I end up getting them done...since most of my time is spent doing nothing...I feel good.  Perhaps, though, 'tis best not to dwell too much on this.  The point is I feel GOOD!

      Trying to get work done, but it is very difficult since I am so tired.  It's also very warm in the library, which isn't helping matters.  Looking forward to getting outside in a bit, on a quest for food.  The cold air should wake me up, but the food will probably have the opposite effect.  Oh well.  Perhaps I will just stay as tired as I am now, the future adventures cancelling each other out.  I'm almost done with reading my assignment, which means surfing time is here soon...

      First day back:  so far so good.  Sat through two classes already without getting called on (nobody else got called on either, so this is no great feat) and have one more to go.  I'm very tired, since I didn't sleep well last night due to the usual first day nerves and excitement, though with every passing semester the first day grows less and less exciting.  Still only have two grades, but such is life.  I'm happy with the ones I have, and getting other ones could only disrupt that happiness.  Looking forward to a slightly less burdensome semester, so we shall see...

      I've always longed for a venue like this, so I could spread my views to the world.  For example, at this time of year, I would be putting out a top ten in film list.  Unfortunately, I have not seen that many movies this year, so it would be hard to compile an accurate one.  But perhaps I will put a little thought into it and see what I can come up with...But don't hold your breath or anything...the wait will not be worth it.

      From My Stupid Dog blogger Timothy Hulsey, on the  urlLink best and the worst in film this year :   Robert Altman's  The Company  was far and away the year's biggest disappointment. Aside from some well-shot (though overlong) ballet sequences, the movie is a sloppy, ill-conceived, unreleasable mess. Still, a friend of mine notes that Altman has achieved the nearly impossible: He's made a two-hour film about dance which features not a single openly Gay character. That's like making a film about jazz with no Black people. So much for the director's legendary "honesty."   Heh.  This blog is quickly becoming one of my favorites.

I have a little reading to do, and if I am very very good about it, I can stay away from Queens tomorrow.  Woo hoo!  Then classes start on Monday, which should be depressing, but is somehow a relief to me.  I think it will be nice to get back into my routine.  Oh, yes, and the best news at all....I'm finally getting internet in my apartment.  This means I will be able to spend less time in Queens over the semester.  This should help my mood during the semester.  Last semester the traveling back and forth nearly every day was draining a lot out of me.   Feeling very optimistic today...

      My grandmother gave me one of those cross-stitch things with my name on it and under it was a description of what the name is supposed to mean and a Biblical quote.  The meaning it attributed to my name (though I make no claim as to it's veracity) was "Little Wise One."  Even if this is far removed from what my name means, it is eerily apropos because anyone who has seen me knows I am little (just a hair over 5' tall) and, as anyone who reads this blog can tell, I am very, very wise.  And modest too, though that is neither here nor there.  Then, there was this quote from Proverbs 31:26:  "She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness."  I guess the kindness thing doesn't fit too well - I'm not a nasty person or anything, but I would never describe myself as particularly kind.  But the law thing is kind of strange.  I looked to the whole chapter in Proverbs for some context, and it appears to be about the virtuous woman, which is also appropriate enough.  I'm so virtuous I'm downright prudish. Meanwhile, my name is on top of the thing, which is the weirdest part of all.  For all I know though, they make ten of these with different quotes and meanings on them, so that they will be assured of coming up with some match with everyone.    Then again, Shannon is not all that common a name...

      Well, I'm back at school, sitting in the cafeteria as I type these words, away from the semi-warmth of the Mississippi Gulf Coast (though it did turn a wee bit chilly just before I left) to the blistering cold of the big bad city.  It has not been a good couple of days, as you can tell from this recap:  ~I almost threw up during my landing at LaGuardia yesterday.  It was very bumpy and hot and I couldn't reach my air thing.  As soon as we landed it was fine.  But the thought still lingers.  ~The bookstore doesn't have one of my books, and they guy told me it would probably take two weeks to get it.  I try to give people the benefit of the doubt (well...sometimes I do), but there is really something wrong with the intelligence of the people who work at the bookstore here at St. John's.  Not to say anything against the guy who helped me - he was very nice and it isn't his fault the book wasn't there.  I need it for Monday, so I will have to go on a quest to find it now.  Or I'll just copy someone else's pages until the books are in stock.  ~The bookstore charged me for highlighters and then didn't give them to me, which means I have to go back in there and deal with the people again.  The girl checking me out even asked if they were mine as she was bagging my stuff.  Oh well...  ~Oh, yeah, and I'm back at school when it's just about the last place I want to be.  In fact, I almost didn't come back at all.  But here I sit, ready to embark on another semester.  I am halfway through, so hopefully, it will all be over soon, and relatively painless at that.  Depressed.  And back.  But still trying to see the bright side of life...

      Well, I just finished the last in the series, and I must say that I am feeling quite depressed.  What's more, I have this odd feeling in the pit of my stomach that will not go away.  I should have known this would happen, but in my zeal to finish reading them all, to absorb all that is currently out there, I ignored this, when I could have been preparing myself.  Perhaps I was unprepared because this usually only happens with movies, and not so much with books, for while I like reading, words have never flown off the page for me in the same way that images dance before me on the silver screen, and thus I have never gotten quite so involved personally in the outcome and the world of books as I have with film.  However, I could sense my feelings, could tell by the way I would shout out at key points, and react viscerally and loudly to things that happened, almost as if it were playing itself out before my eyes - I could see it all - so I should have realized...but I did not.  Anyway, I have always done this...gotten personally involved in things that aren't real.  I get moody and irritable...it's why I never like, or generally don't, like to talk after a movie.  And it isn't any specific outcome that does it...at least I don't think it is.  Instead, it is more to do with the fact that it is over.  I get so immersed that I don't want it to end.  I guess the knowledge that there are more parts to the story should be some comfort to me...but I guess it is the lack of the immediacy that has got me down.    But I shouldn't dwell on it.  I always get over it.  Always.  And I always return to the real world, the world of the living, after dallying in fantasy for too long...but I always fear that I will not.

      Ah, the joys and perils of living in Manhattan, especially in an old apartment building.  Someone is blasting music out their window, and even though mine is closed, I can't keep it out.  At first it was rather novel, and kind of even fun; I was dancing along to the music as I worked on my outline.  Now it is just annoying, about five songs into the program.  I can't exactly tell where it is coming from, or I might complain - though I probably wouldn't, since it is much more my style to toil and fester and seethe in anger rather than to actually do anything constructive about it.  This, coupled with my lack of appreciation for the fine art of confrontation - someone remind me why I want to be a lawyer again - leaves me at something of a loss when it comes to situations like this.  Guess I'll just have to deal with it, ignore it, or continue to dance along.

      ...in every category, with no explanations, though I will admit some of them might seem a bit crazy, but it's just because I'd like to go out on a limb to keep this interesting.  Let's just say I'm not going for total accuracy, and I'm trying to work the surprise factor in as well.  And in some of the..hrm..less important categories, I'm actually blindly guessing (in case you can't tell) So here we go, in the order in which the  urlLink Oscar website  gives them to me:  Best Actor:  Bill Murray Best Supporting Actor:  Tim Robbins Best Actress:  Charlize Theron Best Supporting Actress:  Renee Zellweger Animated Feature Film:  Finding Nemo Art Direction:  Lord of the Rings Cinematography:  Cold Mountain Costume Design:  Girl with a Pearl Earring Best Director:  Peter Jackson Documentary Feature:  Capturing the Friedmans (which the ads on the F train have really made me want to see) Documentary Short Subject:  Asylum Film Editing:  Lord of the Rings Foreign Language Film:  The Barbarian Invasions Makeup:  Lord of the Rings Music (Score):  Lord of the Rings Music (Song):  "Into the West," Lord of the Rings Best Picture:  Lord of the Rings Short Film (Animated):  Nibbles Short Film (Live Action):  Two Soldiers Sound Editing:  Master and Commander Sound Mixing:  Lord of the Rings Visual Effects:  Lord of the Rings Writing (Adapted Screenplay):  Mystic River Writing (Original Screenplay):  Lost in Translation  Okay, so after going through that little exercise, I think most of those were guesses.  I think it's going to be a big night for Lord of the Rings, mostly, so I picked it for nearly everything.  And tomorrow night I'll find out just how wrong I really am.

      I haven't posted a quiz in a while, but this is a silly one for all the law minded folks out there:  YOU ARE RULE 8(a)!  You are Rule 8, the most laid back of all the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  While your forefather in the Federal Rules may have been a stickler for details and particularity, you have clearly rebelled by being pleasant and easy-going.  Rule 8 only requires that a plaintiff provide a short and plain statement of a claim on which a court can grant relief. While there is much to be lauded in your approach, your good nature sometimes gets you in trouble, and you often have to rely on your good friend, Rule 56, to bail you out.     urlLink Which Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    By the way, I don't think this describes me at all.

      I suppose today was a semi-productive day.  The highlights:  1.  I was able to get out of bed at 8:30 AM as planned.  I was tired as heck, but I made it.  2.  I got to school by 10 AM, and settled in for a productive day on a nearly empty 2nd floor in the library.  3.  I got nearly all of my Con Law reading done for the week.  But see below.  4.  I left my computer at home in order to up my productivity level, and it largely worked.  If I weren't so generally lazy, I might have had a more productive day.  But considering if I'd had my computer with me, I'd have gotten even less done, I think I did pretty well.  The lowpoints:  1.  I was assigned to read the new campaign finance case that the Supreme Court decided just last year,  McConnell v. FEC .  And it took me nearly an hour to print.  It is very long.  I was put off by this, so I did all my other Con Law work instead and just skipped this case.  2.  I took a long lunch - this was actually a highlight, but as I'm talking about productivity and not my fun factor, I list it here.  3.  The talking people in the library (ugh!) distracted my focus on my Business Organizations reading, so I didn't get as much of a dent in that as I would have liked.  So I guess I left feeling pretty good.  And I made it home before dark, which makes me feel like I have more time this evening.  Perhaps I will use my time wisely and attack the aforementioned extremely long - but sure to be riveting - Supreme Court case.  Or maybe I'll just eat and watch TV.  Either way, I should be able to sleep well tonight.

      The blogging will be light tomorrow.  In an effort to become a better student, I will be spending most of the day in the library, far away in the land of Queens.  And in an effort to get lots more done than I normally do in said library, I will be leaving the computer behind in fair Manhattan.  Expect activity later in the day, however.   I mean, you can't expect me to stay in the library all day...can you?

      A few words about the symposium I attended today at St. John's Law School, on Immigration Law, put on by my journal.  It was not as bad as I thought it was going to be.  I have very little interest in this area of law, I must say.  One thing that was rather annoying was that all of the speakers spoke for too long, leaving very little time for questions at the end.  All except the keynote speaker - he did a good job of keeping his remarks down, and there was plenty of time at the end for questions.  Lunch was good.  Though I stuffed myself too much with food that I didn't have room for dessert - gasp!  But it could have been a lot worse.  It wasn't even too bad getting up at 6:15.  Maybe I will start trying to get up earlier so I can have more productive days.

      Okay, so I saw  The Passion  last night.  And it was quite an experience.  I think some of the reviews I've read missed the point - which isn't surprising, as I'll explain in a second - when they described it as an assault, because that is exactly what it is meant to be.  Never have I felt so confronted by my faith, with my faith - largely as I believe it to be - and I mean this in the best possible way.  It was a profoundly moving and evocative and...well, profound experience for me, and one I will not likely soon be rid of from my conscience.  Many times I have tried to motivate myself to get back in touch - more accurately, more in touch - with my faith, i.e. finding a church, reading the bible more frequently and in depth.  But now I feel like it is something that I will actually do.  I know it sounds silly, but there is something about seeing a visual representation of something that makes it very hard to ignore - the images and sounds will be long planted in my brain.  I have not been able to get it out of my mind.  Luckily, I saw it with friends, or else I might have literally sobbed all the way home.  It was nice to have a buffer, and even now it's hard to talk about.  The experience, while moving, was also very internal, and it feels strange writing this now, as if none of these words are going to be adequate to explain what it was like.    Aside from all of this, it was a very well made film, and I was surprised by the technique and artistry of it all.  It is a spectacularly beautiful film, and I found myself at times - being so familiar with the story and the passages from the Bible - not reading the subtitles just to take in the wonder of the images.  I think the film is worth seeing from this perspective alone.  Yet, if you are not a Christian, I am not sure that you will be able to get anything more out of it.  I think that this is largely why there have been so many problems with the film, because if you are not Christian, you will likely miss all of the things I've described above in the first paragraph and this is because the film, while exploring the pain suffered by Jesus, doesn't really focus on his message.  This, of course, is the entire point of the passion play - they were largely Catholic exercises, made for believers already.  This is no different, though I'd expand "Catholic" to include any Christian sect.  This film is not likely to convert anyone, or even all that likely to move those "Sunday morning" Christians who are not all that serious about their faith.  This is, to me, a film made for Christians - to expose them to what they believe (not in all its particulars, because there are things in the film not directly derived from the Gospels, but just in the general, basic sense) and to confront them with it, and yes, even to assault them, in the hopes of getting them to take it more seriously.  I think every Christian should see this movie.  But I'd be hard pressed to recommend it to anyone else as anything more than a fine piece of filmmaking in the visual sense (as well as the performances, which I feel are all top-notch) and certainly not as a tool to convert people or educate them more about the Christian faith.  For that, you should read the Bible, and perhaps some C.S. Lewis.    As for the anti-Semitism charges that have plagued the film, I saw very little to complain about - but then, maybe I am once again being colored by my faith.  But I think the film makes fairly clear that God was in control and that it was His decision to sacrifice His Son, and to make Him suffer as much as He did.  This is the entire point of Christianity, and I do not think the film glossed over this aspect in any way.  I'm not saying it was perfect in this respect, but I think the anti-Semitism we are seeing now (like people posting signs saying "The Jews killed Jesus" - I saw one today in the 96th Street station for the 6 train) is not as a result of people seeing the film and lashing out, but is because of all the charges people are making about the film, which in turn has inspired all the nut-jobs to come out of the woodwork.    But I am very glad I saw it.  It was something that I very much needed to see, and I do commend Mel Gibson for making this film and making it as well as he did, if not for all his efforts (or lack thereof) in promoting it and in helping to alleviate concerns of certain groups before the film came out.

      I heard these two transit workers on the train tonight talking about Ralph Nader.  Their general consensus was that he's an idiot who has nothing better to do with his time, so he runs for President.  They are concerned that he could ruin things for the Democrats.  They also seemed to think that he could better serve elsewhere without ruining the party for everyone.  Bottom line, Ralph:  the people want you...just not as their President. But then, I guess you already knew that.

      Been too busy today to post.  Trying to finish up my journal assignment, mostly, and talking with law school friends.  Going to see The Passion tonight, so will probably have something to say about it - though nothing very profound, I'm sure - tomorrow at some point.  I think that it will be an experience, to say the least.    Tomorrow is the Journal of Legal Commentary symposium.  Topic: Immigration Law.  Some of the stuff should be interesting, but because my attendance is compulsory, I am of course not looking forward to it.  It's like when there were books you were supposed to read for class.  It made it that much harder to do because you were forced, when it might have been something you would have otherwise enjoyed reading if you had decided to do so on your own.   But maybe that's just me...

      It's weird when school and real life intersect.  Today, we talked about a case in Con Law dealing with the FCC indecency regulations for the radio.  Then, this afternoon, I trek over for my daily trip to  urlLink Drudge , and find  urlLink this story  about Howard Stern and the FCC regulations on indecency on the radio.  It is moments like these that make me glad I went to law school.  The things I am learning here have some importance and application in the real world, which is something I didn't get at NYU as a Cinema Studies major.

      I don't much like it sometimes here, inside my own head.  It can be a very dark and scary place.  This thought came to me while I was waiting for my search to still load on Westlaw, and as I am still waiting, I figured I'd go ahead and record it here for posterity.  Or at least for the not so distant future.  Sometimes I marvel and the inner workings of my mind.  This is not to brag - I'd probably marvel even more at the inner workings of someone other people's minds assuming I were privy to them.  But that's what's so scary about being inside your own head, it's that, no matter how hard you try, you really can't ever get anyone else to understand your thought processes.  Even those people who know me best, and who can often tell what I am thinking, don't really know how I am thinking it - and it is not something that is easily explained.  In fact, I think it is probably impossible to explain at all.  And that is what is scary, because it is that very thing that can make one feel so isolated and alone.  Except that it shouldn't, because everyone is exactly the same in that respect.  So we are all alike and in it together on the outside, even if we are all alone on the specifics of the inside.  And I think that is certainly something.

      Can we please do something about the girls in the bathrooms here at school who stand for hours in front of the mirrors primping?  First of all, there is no one here worth impressing, and any adjustment that you could possibly make to yourself in the mirror is probably not going to affect anyone's impression of you anyway.  Second of all, you clog up the works for people who need to use the restroom for it's actual purpose in a hurry between classes.  Third of all...well, it just annoys the hell out of me.  I mean, I'm here to learn, not to look like a princess or supermodel.  I can see wanting to look put together; after all, it is a professional school.  But these girls often look anything but professional, wearing tight blue jeans and those pointy, spiky dress shoes with them, and way, way too much makeup.  But I digress.  I don't care what you wear.  I don't even care if you primp.  Just do it out of the way.

      Sometimes I think I try too hard. Others, not hard enough. I seem to always be caught wanting something And not able to articulate it Or willing to ask for it Or even mention it at all For fear of upsetting the balance The way people see me The way I want them to see me Which is not the way I see myself Or the way I really am. For if people could see me, I mean really see me They certainly wouldn't like what they saw And they'd run from me Or never speak to me again, And then I'd be alone. Only I already am. Alone because no one knows me, No one sees me, I won't let anyone in And won't let anyone out of what I want them to see. And I hide when I cry, Until the crying passes and I can once again face the world, The world that doesn't even know I exist Where people meet me only to forget me, Because I don't want them to remember, Because remembering is knowing. So sometimes I think I try to hard. And at the same time, not hard enough.

      Why do I find it so hard to talk about things that really bother me?  I can't honestly say.  The only thing I can say is that when I'm upset I feel trapped inside my own head.  And it's a very oppressive feeling.  I think this is probably why I so often have dreams where I am in trouble, and I need to scream for help, but I can't get any sound to come out of my mouth.  Things move very slowly and I feel like I'm underwater, and that there is this great weight on me that I can't throw.  And it hurts.  And that's exactly what I feel like when I'm upset.  And I guess I don't say anything because when it's a dream, I always wake up.  Only now there's nothing to wake up too, because I'm already awake.  Only that's not it at all really; that's only my way of rationalizing my own silliness.

      This is a  urlLink remarkably silly  idea from the President of the United States.  I'd say it was something more, like frightening, if it weren't the most unlikely of events that it would succeed.  But indeed, it is somewhat frightening that the President has so little respect for the Constitution that he would be willing to throw his support behind this type of amendment.  It is simply beneath the dignity and beyond the scope of the document to be worthy of inclusion alongside those amendments dealing with freedom or speech or religion or equal protection.  And he is totally trashing the supposedly conservative concept of federalism, which should let each state decide how they want to handle this subject.    The cynic in me realizes that Bush knows this doesn't have a chance in hell of actually becoming an amendment to the Constitution.  He is merely trying to appease his base now that it looks like the election in November might actually be close.  But it does seem to be a rather petty and fickle thing to command the the President's attention when it should be focused elsewhere.  I am very disappointed indeed.  I'm not saying he should come out in support of gay marriage, but he should stick to conservative principles of keeping the federal government's nose out of stuff that it doesn't belong in.  I am reminded today why, though I share so many of their views, I do not call myself a Republican.  If I did, today I would indeed be ashamed to carry that title.

      Well, today is Mardi Gras, and normally (had I not moved from Gulfport, MS to New York City), this would mean a day off of school for me.  Apparently, the word from my mother (not to mention the Weather Channel) is that it is a rather dreary day, so perhaps the celebration will not be as big as it usually is.  I was never much into the revelry of it; I just liked to have another day off of school.  But I live here now, and in the library I sit, aiming for another productive day.  Oh, and for those who are keeping the weather score, here it is snowing.  But it's not sticking, and this is the kind of snow I can really get behind, so that's cool.  And it's not like I have to be outside in it.

      I sometimes think that I have a very narrow world view.  By this I mean I tend to think squarely inside the box.  For instance, it would never occur to me to ask for an extension on something due at school, even for a one-on-one project (like my directed research) simply because in my mind, things are due when they are due.  I tend to think of due dates as immutable.  It wasn't until I was talking with my professor, and I asked him to confirm the due date for my research outline, that he suggested that if I am a little behind it would be OK to turn it in late.  Now that I think about it, it makes perfect sense.  Obviously, he'd prefer to have it in on Friday.  But he'd also prefer it to be well-done.  Me, I'd half-throw it together to get it in on time, rather than take into consideration that he might not want to read it that way, and would rather a better finished product, even if that means that it takes more time.    That said, I may not take the extra time anyway, because something still seems wrong about it, to me.  Like I'm getting preferential treatment or something.  Which I guess isn't always such a big deal - it happens all the time really.  I guess I'm just extra-sensitive about it because I grew up taking ballet from my mom, and she was always going the extra mile to make sure it didn't seem like I was getting favored treatment.  It's kind of ingrained in me.  Which just goes to show: no matter how rational we are about anything, old habits die hard.

      Well, well, well.  Normally the Screen Actor's Guild Awards are an accurate prediction of who will take home the acting honors at the Oscars.  So I don't quite know what to make of this:  Johnny Depp, who surprised me with a nomination, managed to  urlLink pull off the upset last night by winning .  Last year they were  urlLink somewhat off as well , so perhaps I will write this off as an aberration, and stick with my tentative prediction of Sean Penn to win.  Still, it might be time to check the odds.

      Check out this precious little nugget from the  urlLink New York Daily News  (scroll down to see that I am not making this up):   New York Sen. Charles Schumer's fondness for publicity was the subject of a little needling by New Jersey Sen. Jon Corzine at the recent 50th annual Washington Press Club Foundation Dinner.   "Frankly, sharing a media market with Chuck Schumer is like sharing a banana with a monkey," said the Garden Statesman. "Take a little bite of it, and he will throw his own feces at you."   Schumer, who wasn't at the dinner, was said to be irked by the simian swipe. But he tells The Hill: "It was all in good fun."   Looks like the New York/New Jersey feud lives on my friends, up to the very highest branches of our national government.

      In today's segment of Where-Is-Shannon's-Brain, Shannon decides to trek all the way to school to be a good student and actually do the reading for some of her classes, and walks all the way to the 53rd and 3rd entrance to the E train to discover that she'd forgotten that this entrance was closed.  Then, upon arriving at school, she realized that she'd forgotten the charger for her computer, so she couldn't do half of the things she planned on doing in the library because her battery wouldn't last long enough.  So now, Shannon,  sans  brain, sits in the library doing her reading, which is the only thing she can do without prolonged use of the computer...Except for updating the blog, of course.  They say talking about yourself in the 3rd person is a sign of great trouble....Just think how well it served Bob Dole.

      Okay, so I sat through the 5 hour Bar-Bri lecture on Professional Responsibility for the MPRE today, and I must say I'm better for the wear.  I mean, some of the stuff was familiar from when I took Professional Responsibility last semester, which I'm still bitter about having had to take, considering I have to sit through the torture of preparing for this exam as well.  Ah,  c'est la vie .   Now, I'm rewarding myself by taking the evening off, watching some movies perhaps (otherwise just television), and finishing up my second trip through the third Harry Potter book.  And there's chocolate ice cream waiting for me in the freezer, which, considering it is the only edible item in my whole apartment, will most certainly be devoured sometime soon.  It will not survive the night.  It's perhaps not the most exciting way to spend a Saturday night, but it is relaxing, and that's about the best that I can hope for from my life at the moment.  I had a better offer for tonight - but I need to be productive tomorrow, so I really can't be out until all hours.  That said, it is Gina's birthday celebration, and I'm very sorry I have to miss it.  If only my law school friends were into more low key forms of entertainment.  Re-reading the above prior to posting this, and seeing the progression of my thoughts, I must say that it never ceases to amaze me how my mind works.  I hope this stream-of-consciousness thing is working for everyone else...I'll try and be more structured in the future.  'Til then...

      Fox News is reporting that  urlLink Ralph Nader will be entering the fray  of Presidential election politics yet again.  This comes relatively soon after Dean has dropped out of the race, and one has to wonder if the two situations are related.  I'm not sure how significant this is, really.  Nader could be a factor in a close election, as he was in 2000, but I'd say most people who are on the fence about Nader really don't like Bush and would do almost anything to see him not get re-elected, and this would include settling for the Democratic candidate, whoever that might turn out to be.  But there are still going to be the crazy die hards who will vote for him, and if that is the case, he could have an impact.  It's something to watch anyway.

I think I've finally found a direction, and now I just have to bust my butt on the research end of it to come up with support for what I want to say.  Woo hoo!  Things are looking up yet again.

      Okay, so I haven't posted anything very meaningful in a while.  But there's a lot going on here.  I've realized I'm over a month into the semester and things are going so fast, and of course I'm behind, so I'm constantly playing catch up, only the fact that I'm behind drags me down, so I get even more behind...you get the picture.    This week I've been working on this very big, very important paper that I'm supposed to be writing.  Only I have no idea what I want to say, much less what I can say.  Writing a legal paper is not so easy.  It's not like college, where I could just say whatever I wanted with nothing to back it up.  Most of this paper is going to be footnotes, which means most of it will be stuff that other people have said that I have to use to support what I want to say, to support my argument.  This is not an easy task.  So today I'm trying to get a grip on it.  Only it isn't happening as well as I'd like.  I know if I work hard it will come together, as it always does, but that doesn't stop me from having the same huge self-doubt that I always have when something like this is looming on the horizon.  I always think I can't cut it, and no matter how many times I'm proven wrong, it still comes back.  So I'm chanting in my head to remind myself that I'm not a miserable failure, which is actually helping - only all the chanting makes it a bit hard to concentrate.  But this is not the only craziness going on in my life.  If this were all I could handle it with no problem at all.  But despite this, there are so many good things, so I shall choose to focus on them.  Not to the point of ignoring the bad stuff, though, because I've done that before and nothing good comes of that.  Oh, well.  I guess I should get back to work now.  Already, I feel better just from having vented.  It's hard not to have someone you can really vent to, or worse still to have people to vent to but to be to concerned about bothering them or bringing them down with your trifling problems.  So I vent to this page, and if people happen to read it, then that's cool.    No worries folks.  I'm not teetering on the edge of sanity.  I'm just stressed.  But it's law school, it's what I signed up for, and I'm very happy with it most of the time.  It just gets to be a bit much on occasion, which is when I feel the need to post here.   And now that I have done so...and feel tremendously better, I should get back to work, so I can figure out what the heck I'm going to say in this paper.  I have an outline due next week, complete with sources, so I figure now's a great time to get it together.  Onward and upward, as they say.

      Drudge links  urlLink this story about the primary race in Wisconsin .  It's nice to see Edwards doing well, since...well, since he's not John Kerry.  However, there is a quote about halfway through the article (scroll down if you don't believe me) that struck me as rather odd:   Byron Conway, 27, of Milwaukee, said Kerry was the only candidate with a shot at beating Bush. "I just want him out," he said.   Barbara Chamberlain, 79, also of Milwaukee, backed Edwards for the same reason. "I have hope for him beating you-know-who," she said.    You-know-who ??  Is Bush really so evil that Democrats can't bring themselves to say his name?  I think this lady needs to get a grip.

      Here's an interesting piece from MSN on  urlLink unworthy Oscar winners  of the past.  I don't agree with all of the reviewers choices, per se, but it is a fun sport nonetheless, to second-guess the Academy.  One he doesn't mention (or perhaps he does - I only skimmed the article) from recent history that really bothered me was  Gladiator  winning Best Picture.

      Well, my big six day weekend has turned in exactly zero productivity.  I let it get away from me big time.  I guess I kept thinking I had all this time, so I kept putting everything off, when I really didn't have that much time at all.  And then - it was all gone.  So today's the last day, and I'm scrambling to get stuff done again.  The good news is I only have class tomorrow, and then I get four more days.  One of those will be filled with reviewing for the MPRE, but other than that, I should feel the crunch, and get some stuff done.  And perhaps even have a little relaxation time...

      Maybe it's just me but..."Godric" doesn't seem to be all that common of a name.  Yet, in flipping through the Fall 2002 issue of the  St. John's Law Review , and there he was:  Godric C. Shoesmith.  So I  urlLink Googled him , knowing that this is such an unusual name that I was bound to come up with the right guy.  Looks like he works for Simpson Thacher & Bartlett now.  Wish he could get me a job...with his cool name and all.

      My bestest friend, who was so nervous about not getting into any graduate programs, just got into Vanderbilt, who apparently loves her very much.  So congrats, Christina - even though I already delivered them personally, this is extraordinary news that wants sharing with the world, or at least with the three people who read this blog, including myself.  And if you end up going there, well then you'll just have to start your own blog and call it "Southerner from New Jersey."  Oh, and I told you so.  So this is a cautionary tale to all you non-believers out there - do not doubt the power of the word of Shannon.  Once I speak on a matter, it is all but set.

      A particularly cruel (but not so unique) twist in the affirmative action debate - a student of Michigan State University is actually  urlLink called out ,  in front of her whole class , by the professor for writing a letter to the school paper expressing her opposition to affirmative action.  Check the link (courtesy of  urlLink Andrew Sullivan ) for comments of support.  I posted one myself (not because I'm necessarily against affirmative action), but I am mainly appalled that someone who supports affirmative action would excoriate a student for expressing her opinion on  any  subject when one of the main justifications (and a noble one, I might add)  for  affirmative action is the diversity of ideas that is beneficial to the collegiate experience.  It is a strange atmosphere for diversity indeed when one must agree with everything the prof says for fear of getting reamed in class for disagreement.

      Girls night out was fun...girls protesting Valentine's Day.  Saw  Win a Date with Tad Hamilton , which, as those movies go, was not too terrible after all.  It was helped greatly by the presence of Gary Cole - which was a nice surprise.  Also ate some pizza, talked some politics, and had an all around fun evening.  Now, I'm polishing off the rest of the ice-cream, and then it's to bed.  Oh, and I watched  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington  today, and quickly reaffirmed my deep and abiding love for Claude Raines.  One of these days, perhaps I will mount a semi-spirited defense of his character in the movie.  But not today.

      Well, I've been very lax in posting I know.  It's just that there isn't much going on that's exciting in my life.  I've been working on my second go-through of the Harry Potter books, which makes me an official geek.  And Ken Starr was on campus today, a guest of the Federalist Society (the first campus organization that I think I might actually join semi-enthusiastically - totally unrelated to the presence of Ken Starr I can assure you), so I went to hear him speak.  It was very interesting.  He was a bit long winded in his responses to questions, so there weren't as much discourse as I would have liked.  But students were mostly respectful of his presence, which was nice.  With a different audience, it could have been a lot more hostile and confrontational, and I'm not sure I would have liked to see two such events at school in one week.  He gave a nice talk, didn't say anything too controversial, and it was not an unpleasant experience.  I guess I just expected something more from someone with so impressive a background - despite his rather infamous position as independent counsel, he served as Solicitor General and as a Federal Judge, so he's obviously a pretty bright guy, no matter what one thinks of his politics.  But he didn't seem to have anything too original to say.  But he was very articulate, so I suppose the afternoon could have been spent in a worse way.  I could have been watching the Game Show Network.

      Well, I've managed to get a good night's sleep a couple of days in a row, so (not wanting to jinx anything), I think I may have my sleep patterns sort of back on track, which is a good thing.  Now, if only I can keep up with going to bed early and getting up (relatively) early, since I have so many days off before I have to get up early again.  But I will do my best.  No caffeine after 3 PM, which means I need to hurry up and get going, or I'm going to miss out on my caffeine quotient completely today.

      I just went to a very interesting debate on the issue of affirmative action here at St. John's Law School.  I myself am not entirely sure how I feel about affirmative action.  I think that, as a political idea, quotas are bad but I do favor the use of race as one factor among many that can lead to a person being a qualified candidate for admission to any school or job or whatever the case may be.  That said, I think that it may well be unconstitutional in many contexts, though I honestly have not investigated the issue enough to form an opinion on this.    Having said this, I was impressed with the diversity of the views expressed by the debaters themselves, as well as the audience.  This is an issue that tends to get people riled up, because race is a very sensitive subject in this country.  For once, it was nice to avoid the "blame the South" mentality, and to even hear a recognition that racism does indeed exist outside the South, as well as a recognition that the "problem" of affirmative action arises partially from the problem of "white flight," which is, if not wholly a Northern occurrence, is at least an urban occurrence, from which the South is at least more immune than the North, because there are not as many large cities.  That, and the more open and more governmental forms of discrimination employed against black people in the South have ironically I think led to a situation know where racism still exists, but is largely going to be overcome because of desegregation.  This, coupled with the poorer socio-economic status of the average Southern person (thus preventing "white flight" as much because it is not economically feasible for as many people), will, I think in time, as the generations pass, lead to a more harmonious relationship between the races in the South because the racism that is taught in so many homes will be counteracted by the reality of being exposed to people of different races and seeing them for who they truly are.  Or perhaps this is overly optimistic of me.  To me, the problems that affirmative action is seeking to fix are not problems that are going to be fixed by affirmative action.  In a perfect world, I think that race would not matter at all.  But of course it does, not so much because of racism (or at least not because of individual racism, though there may be an institutional component), but because the socio-economic conditions that many minorities find themselves in that prevent the situation from being corrected.  A better corrective would be to fix the educational system in this country, so that everyone who receives a "public" education receives a decent education.  But this costs too much money, so affirmative action sort of exists as a band-aid - it covers the wound but does not prevent the scar.  That said, I think diversity is a good goal.  I think that I benefited from growing up in Southern Mississippi, and going to a public high school, that was probably 60/40 white/black ratio.  I think it has made me more comfortable around persons of different races, especially because race is such a big deal in this country, that I think many people who grew up in mostly white areas as a result of fleeing the cities for the suburbs have not been exposed to.  And if race is one of the factors considered as a corrective, then I have no problem with it, although a better route might be to focus on socio-economic factors instead of race to avoid the issue of "race" altogether.  But since race is the whole issue, and a very volatile one at that, I think that it is a debate that will not end any time soon.  There was a girl behind me at the debate who seemed to have a problem with both sides at various times.  Mainly she annoyed me because she was talking through the whole thing, very loudly at that, and seemed to think that everything that was said was stupid or wrong, yet offered no comments of her own to contribute to the elevation of the discussion, aside from those she muttered under her breath.  And one of the debaters was this white kid, and he was against affirmative action, and as he was making some of his arguments, she dismissed them as coming from a "white Jew" and wondered what such a person could possibly know about the difficult of discrimination or the hardship in getting a job.  I do not profess to know the debaters religious or ethnic background - but this seems to be patently unfair, as it suggests that no one who is not black or not an "approved" minority has no right to have an opinion on the issue.  The whole point of a debate is to bring people together from different perspectives in order to get those different perspectives addressed.  And everyone should be able to have a say.  And if you aren't willing to stand up and say what you think, you really shouldn't throw sneaky comments around in the background.  If you aren't willing to publicly engage, then perhaps you should just sit idly by and listen, and respect those with whom you disagree.    All in all, while it was informative, I'm not sure it was all that productive.  It was too heated - which leads to people not really listening to what each other has to say and no true debate can function this way.  Unfortunately, with human passions the way they are, I think that there is no other way to have such a debate.  That said, all the people on the panel were very well-spoken and very respectful of one another.  And I think that was really good.  I could say a lot more on this, but I think I'll spare all of you.  It's two and a half more hours until the beginning of my super long weekend, so I should be of a more cheerful stock.  And I must prepare for class...

      I haven't posted anything from Christopher Hitchens in a while, but this is a good, and relatively short, read, on who  urlLink he thinks should be the Democratic nominee for President .  I must admit I have lost interest at this point as to who the nominee will be, since I am just to the bad side of ambivalent about Kerry, who it seems now is almost certain to be the nominee, though it is not "official" just yet.  But read the piece anyway, for a thoughtful and nuanced position...from the left (I don't care what Hitchens' compatriots on the left say about his so-called political conversion - he is still a man of the left)...on the importance of the issue of the "War on Terror" (for lack of a better designation) in the upcoming election.  If ever I were to advocate voting based on a single issue, this would be it.  Hitchens puts it much better than I ever could, but the if the problem of terrorism (both foreign and domestic) is not dealt with, if it is not front and center on the agenda until the problem is significantly eradicated, then the other issues simply don't matter.

      I lead a charmed life, folks.  I've just been introduced to my new best friend:  the six-day weekend.  That's right, starting tomorrow night at 10:35, I will be freed from the obligation of attending class until 9:00 the next Wednesday morning.  Let's just hope I can make all the extra time worthwhile, and get caught up on things, and perhaps even a little ahead.

      Been running around like a crazy person this morning.  You know, if it isn't one thing, it's another.  The good news is I was able to sleep last night.  The bad news is I wish I'd stayed in bed, with the morning I've been having.  I printed stuff out last night, and came to school this morning to find that it had not printed at all.  Then, this morning, I reprint, and nearly everything I sent to print printed incorrectly.  So on the third try I finally had some success.  So I guess I'll just have to thank the Lord for small miracles, and hope that some larger ones find their way my direction soon.  There is a long weekend coming up for me, which is nice.  My goal is to be caught up and ready to take on next week with full force come Tuesday morning, just a week from now.  We shall see how that works out for me.  Guess I should start my dedicated fast working now, if I'm going to get anything done at all today.  No time to waste...I wasted it all already on the Lexis printers in the Journal office on the third floor.

      Okay, so I know I promised a big time analysis of Bush on Meet the Press...but I didn't watch it.  I decided to watch Masterpiece Theatre instead, for the next part of The Forsyte Saga.  And I was not disappointed.  It was a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed it a lot.  So I can't wait for the next part.  That's all for now, because I just gushed about it with a friend, so the rest of you get spared my blathering on about it.  But it was good, and everyone should watch.

      Okay, folks, I need the big time prayers and thoughts and best wishes today.  I seem to be having a slight insomnia problem of late.  It's a vicious cycle, because every night I am up late, and then I sleep late into the next day and am unable to get started, and am up late again the next night...I think you get the picture.  Part of it is my schedule, since I only actually have to get up early two days a week, so I'm more prone to stay up late (which I like) and sleep late (which I like even more).  So, I need help getting it in gear.  So, send me prayers or keep your fingers crossed, or send me happy mental thoughts or whatever it is that you do so well...unless of course you like the idea of me tossing and turning in bed at 3 AM, in which case you may feel free to ignore my plight.    So now I'm trying to muddle my tired self through the day.  I'll make it though, with the help of my good friend, the Dew.  Though I have to be careful not to drink any too late, because I don't want the caffeine messing up my system.  I want to be tired enough to drift off into peaceful slumber tonight...

      Ice cream is God's little helper.  It's there to soothe you and get you through a particularly tough time, one that is not so readily solvable, or to tide you over between tough times.  It is comfort and joy incarnate, and as it winds its way from the carton to the spoon and through your body, it spreads that joy to you, so that it can very nearly emanate from you.  Of course, it also has the effect of adding on the pounds, but this is rather a small price to pay.  It's also God's way of getting you to exercise - if you are going to enjoy one of His finest creations with as little repercussions as possible, then you'd better get your butts up off the sofa and into the gym.  Of course, it is not so easy to practice what one preaches.  It seems I want all the comfort of ice cream without any of the sacrifice.  So I am doomed to a life where I never fit into my clothes...But still I think the ice cream is worth it.

      I have a few words to say about Tony Kushner.  I think that, politics aside, he is a very brilliant man and a brilliant writer.  I loved  Angels in America  when I read it, as a work of literature and of art, and I think the HBO movie adaptation was wonderful.  And I'm sure, if I'd been old enough to have seen the original stage version of the play, that I would have loved it as well.  He has a way with words and images that is rare to find in a playwright.  The thing with him is that it is hard to put politics aside because he blindly refuses to.  And in doing so, he very often  urlLink goes to far .    But even this could be forgiven if he produced works that were not only brilliant in their own time, but were somehow transcendent, the way really great art is and should be.  But his works are so tied up in current political and social events that I fear his works will be largely forgotten by the time the next generation comes around.  Despite the warm reception that the T.V. version of  Angels in America  received at the Golden Globes - winning everything it was up for - even that play, a little more than a decade after it was written and first produced, seems largely out of place, largely dated in today's world.  It's hard to make historical judgments about works that are still largely unhistorical in the same way that it's hard to make a judgment about how important any particular event will be historically speaking when that event is not far enough removed from the present to accurately evaluate it's significance.  But Kusher's works are so specifically grounded in the current time in which they are written that it is hard to think that they will continue to be significant when circumstances have changed.  So perhaps it is easy to put up with him and his polemical silliness now because time, in the end, will render him completely insignificant, and his brand of discourse, while attractive to some, is never long-lasting.  In the end, it turns people off and runs them off with its unreasonableness.

      Just watched "CSI" for the first time in a while.  I forgot how much I love that show.  This one was especially good.  Any show that can fit vampires and  The Mikado  into the same episode (albeit different story lines) has got to have something going for it.  This, of course, immediately made me want to watch  Topsy-Turvy  - which is one great movie, for those of you who haven't seen it.  Anyway, after a long period of wandering in the dark, I have seen the light and am back on the "CSI" bandwagon.

      Okay, so I had this strange dream last night, and normally I can tell why I dream the things I do, but this one has thrown me for a loop.  It came out of the blue.  I dreamt I was in my Con Law class from last semester, and the professor was making me go over my answers to his exam...in front of the whole class.  He was very kind about my stupidity though, but since it wasn't really him, I'm not going to give him any credit for that one.  Anyway, it was very weird.  And since that class is now over, it's strange that I would dream about it now.  But dream it I did.  And I still remember it now, which is also strange, because I usually never remember my dreams longer than a few minutes after waking up.    Oh, well, speaking of sleep...I feel rather like taking a nap...

      Oops...spoke too soon...we're watching a clip from  Presumed Innocent .  But I'm still not into this.  After all, I did come to law school to get away from movies in class.  I had a great quote once, I think it was Will Rogers who said it:  "There is only one thing that can kill the movies, and that is education."  The good folks in Cinema Studies would be well-advised to take this man's advice.

      I got the giggles in my Constitutional Law class today, and I couldn't get rid of it.  The professor is very animated, and he's also very funny, plus some of the cases are rather funny...if one is slightly immature, which I've never seen myself as.  But still, today I laughed.  And once I started I couldn't stop.  Guess I was just really tired.  I feel like it's been a long week, even though it hasn't.  I guess I just have a lot going on, and that makes it feel long.    Today, however, is a long day.  At school from 9 AM until 10:35 PM.  I may need a map to make it that long.  That, or copious amounts of caffeine.

      I'm going to pick an Oscar nominated film to see this weekend, so I can be more informed than I am now come Feburary 29.  Right now I am leaning toward  21 Grams .  Other choices:   House of Sand and Fog ,  In America ,  Pieces of April ,  City of God ,  Monster , or  Master and Commander .  How I'll ever decide, I don't know...

      This is the second time I've heard tale of it, so I am guessing it is true:  Bush is actually proposing a  urlLink rather large increase in the budget of the National Endowment for the Arts .  This article calls the increase the largest in 20 years.  The article also notes that this is surprising, to say the least.  But maybe it isn't that difficult to believe after all.  If you ever read  urlLink Andrew Sullivan , (and if you don't I'll keep saying it - you should) you'll know that the conservative fear of spending has actually seemed to elude the younger Bush.  So we'll just add this to the list of more money that the administration wants to spent.  It is, however, strange that the administration wants to spend it at all.  The article above seems to attribute this somewhat to the influence of Laura Bush, and the concept of a First Lady being the cause of policy initiatives is not anything new.  I have no idea what the cause, but I do find it somewhat ironic that the largest increase in the budget of the NEA should come under a  Republican  president, in particular  this  Republican president, who has probably engendered more hatred among those in the artistic communities than any other, which the possible exception of Ronald Reagan.  Not that this is likely to change any of that...for the complaints will still come that, despite the increase, the arts budget is pitifully low.  Which I suppose is true enough.  But still, it would seem to be that a small step in the right direction is something to praise, not criticize, and this is something that could be readily admitted to by those on the left without signing on kit-and-kaboodle to the whole of Bush's policies.    But that's just my 2 cents...though it's probably worth less than that even.

      I got some bad news this weekend, and I was trying to figure out the best way to post about it, hence my delay.  My mother emailed me on Saturday morning to tell me that my Great-grandmother - everyone called her Mammy - had died.  The news has saddened me, though not for the usual reasons.  It is sad that she is gone, but she did lead a full and meaningful life, which is more than any of us can ask, and she didn't die in any pain, she just gradually faded over the course of the week and slipped away from this world sometime in her sleep.  What grieves me the most is that she lived so long and saw so much - she was 100 years old - and yet I never appreciated that fact, and how much she could teach me about the world as it was and as it is.  It is rare to meet a person who has lived through so much...even now that people are living longer, it is still a somewhat rare occurrence to meet someone who lived so long as her.  There are so many things she must have seen or been a part of or been affected by, from the great historical events from last century that are just pages in a book or images from the past to me to the mundane and personal family traumas and triumphs that now exist only as stories from people who weren't there or are too young to remember.  Other memories are locked tightly away in her mind.  In recent years, it might have been difficult to extract such information from her - she was still as alert as possible, but hard of hearing and slightly forgetful.  But when I would visit her, she would always, after a second, upon prodding, remember who I was.  And that is what is sad, for I don't have the capability of remembering who she is, because I never really knew.  And I could kick myself for not being more curious about her when I was younger, when I could have gotten her unclouded perspective on things.  Someone very wise once chastised me for not knowing more about the past of my family and its individual members.  I didn't listen, so it is too late for my Great-grandmother.  But it is not too late for my grandparents, at least the ones that are left.  And the next chance I get, you can bet I will extract from them all the knowledge and remembrance that I can.  I will not tune out my Grandfather's military stories, or my Grandmothers memories of her childhood in Mississippi.  I will listen, I will be curious and ask questions to elicit even more information than is offered, and I will learn, before all of it is gone forever.

      Current love of my life:  Richard Dawson.  He can currently be seen on the Game Show Network, as an erstwhile panelist on "Match Game" and as the ubiquitous host of the older episodes of "Family Feud," wearing three-piece suits.  Also famous for being one of the more normal people associated with "Hogan's Heroes" - he was the British guy.  Then again, Bob Crane was probably strange enough to make up for everyone else.  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, rent  Auto Focus .   Now what was I saying...

      Somehow I knew the whole  urlLink Janet Jackson exposing herself at the halftime show last night  was going to come up in my Evidence class tonight, especially since we were beginning character evidence tonight.  The highlights (from class, not the show, which I didn't see as I never watch the halftime show at the Super Bowl):  "I don't even have cable, so breasts on my television are a strange occurrence" and "How do you spell pasty?"  Both quotes are from my professor.  Incidentally, there seems to be some debate about whether a pasty was involved at all.  But I guess that just goes to show that one man's pasty is another man's nipple ring.    I would also like to disavow all claims that I do indeed know how to spell "pasty."  Any correctness of my spelling is purely coincidental.  Oh, yeah, and by the way, the Pats won.  This was  urlLink promptly followed by riots in Boston .  Damn yankees.  But, still I say, GO PATS!

      The connections between New Jersey and the South just keep coming, folks... urlLink Woodrow Wilson , born and raised in the South, served two years as governor of New Jersey before becoming President of the United States.  Oh, and just so you don't think that I was surfing the Presidential biographies, my professor just happened to mention it in class.

      My master plan did not go as...well, as planned.  I got to school, sans computer, yes, but unfortunately also sans syllabus, so I was unable to do any of my reading because I did not know what to read.  So I'm back, Con Law book in tow, back in pain from having to lug it back with me.  And I had to deal with the crowds.  I guess I'm not usually out and about on a Sunday afternoon, but there did seem to be an awfully large number of people out, and all in groups too.  Oh, well.  Perhaps it is just Superbowl mania hitting the streets of New York.  In that spirit, GO PATS!  As I go back to work...

      Going to school without my computer for the second time.  The first time it didn't help me too much, but then there were people I knew around to distract me.  So today should be better, since everyone else is involved in Superbowl prep, and I will be watching the game all alone (sigh), so there is nothing to prepare for.  Go Pats!

      I have not watched the news in a while, having been rather busy and preoccupied with other matters.  But last night, I managed to snag a good night's sleep, so I'm up with a little extra time this morning, so I put on the news.  And I must admit that I am disturbed by what I see.  Or rather, what I don't see.  Let me preface this by saying that I know this is an election year.  And I know that the outcome of this election is very important, possibly more important than any election since 1860.  But it is certainly not important for the reasons the news seems to suggest.  For example, when I turn on the news, they're talking about the 9/11 Commission mess.  Now, I believe that it is important to know what was known, and when it was known.  But I don't think it really matters for the here and now.  And I don't think it says anything about future action.  Everyone was caught by surprise on 9/11.  Should it have been surprising?  Perhaps not.  But it was.  Hindsight is 20/20 and for anyone to say now that the administration knew exactly what was going to happen and dropped the ball is silly.  Let's not forget that there was eight years of Clinton's Presidency, and four years of Bush's father, and so on, for however far you think we should go back, not to mention all the Congressmen who have access to intelligence information.  I say this not to blame anyone, because I think trying to assign blame after the fact is just wrong.  Or, more accurately, I think trying to assign the blame to anyone in any administration or in the government here after the fact is just wrong.  Finding out what happened is one thing, but what's more important is what has been done afterwards, after the threat has fermented itself and seared itself on all our imaginations.    There is only one thing to blame for 9/11 and that is terrorism; and only one group to blame, and that is al-Qaeda, and those that supported them and other terrorist groups.  And having been awakened to the terror threat wholly and fully, and not just by foggy intelligence info and rumors, the Bush administration has largely risen to the call.    I fear that all these distractions mean that Americans are getting complacent, that terrorism is no longer a fear of most of them, nor a major issue that they plan on voting on.  For me, it is the main, and probably sole, issue I will vote on, because I think that if this war is not handled properly, then the rest of it doesn't really matter.  That doesn't mean that terrorism should be the only thing people talk about.  I think there are plenty of other issues out there worth discussing, and discussing robustly at that.  But I also think we should not lose sight of what is really most important of all, and that is preventing another 9/11, and ending as best as possible the terror threat that is spreading across the globe.  And these things should be prioritized accordingly.  But I have no hope that they will be.  I fear that only the worst can refocus people's attention, and then it will largely be too late.  For the best lesson we can learn from 9/11 is that the threat is real, and it can hit us at any time.  And the best lesson we can learn from knowing what was known in the months and years before 9/11 is not to lay the blame at someone's feet, but to know how to read such information we might get in the future, because prevention is the goal.  That, and eradication.    I hope I'm wrong.  I hope people can be re-convinced of the importance of this without another attack.  But there's already been another attack, the bombings in Spain, and that didn't seem to refocus anyone too much, so I won't be holding my breath.

      Another fun quiz, from the same place as before:         I am  a Bowler Hat .   I'm very proper, often politically correct, precise and dapper. I generally look down on the masses, but I usually try not to let it show.  What Sort of Hat Are You?       It's amazing how in ten questions one of these quizzes can size up your life so well.  I don't know if that's sad or cool.

      Fun Quiz Time:          I am, of course, none other than  blank verse . I don't know where I'm going, yes, quite right; And when I get there (if I ever do) I might not recognise it. So? Your point? Why should I have a destination set? I'm relatively happy as I am, And wouldn't want to be forever aimed Towards some future path or special goal. It's not to do with laziness, as such. It's just that one the whole I'd rather not Be bothered - so I drift contentedly; An underrated way of life, I find.     What Poetry Form Are You?       It's kind of ironic, and appropos in a way, because I once wrote a poem in blank verse.  And it was actually good.  Perhaps, one day I will post it.  But today is not that day.

      The eye drifts Down the leg, The perfectly fitted, starched leg of faded blue jean, To the pointy clad foot Sticking out from under the hem. The hard heels Pound their surly Manhattan beat, Ankles holdind their own, Wobbling, threatening to keel over, Straining to avoid a strain.  These women and their shoes, I hate them so much.

      I have it on good authority (i.e. Christina told me and TV Guide confirmed) that  urlLink Jerry Orbach is leaving  Law & Order   at the end of this season.  I do not follow this show (or really any other show) that faithfully anymore, but it is still very sad news.  Though he has been doing the show for 12 years, so perhaps it is for the best that he is moving on, perhaps he will do other interesting things.  Though the show will not be the same without his character.    This does, however, make me mildly interested in seeing the rest of the season.  The show has not always been the best at giving its characters good exits, but after 12 years, Lennie deserves to go out with flair.  Dare I suggest a musical episode?  In other TV news, I watched  The West Wing  for the first time in a while this week, and it was actually pretty good.  No idea whether this was just a blip in an otherwise downward trajectory, or whether this is a signal of better things to come.  I hope it is the latter, but I am still a skeptic until proved otherwise.   Also,  Law & Order  season 2 is coming out on DVD soon, just in time for my birthday.  I may have to use a little bit of the money I am (hopefully) getting and pre-order it.  Since TNT barely ever shows these old episodes, it will be nice to have access to them.  In case you didn't notice from reading this, I'm trying to waste time.  I am very worn out from my week of heavy hitting, and can't work up much of a will to do anything other than stare at my computer or watch TV.  I need to be working on my Personal Statement for Journal elections, but as I'm not in the mood - and have no idea what I should or am going to say - I will perhaps put that off for a little bit longer.  My goal is to finish that before I go to bed.  If I can manage that, I'd say that today would be productive.

      I just went grocery shopping, something I've needed to do for a long time.  It's nice to have a little food in the house.    But, of course, I'm still going to Wendy's for lunch.  I'll be attacking the food I bought for snacking and desserting purposes soon enough, though.  I'm just having one of those too-lazy-to-cook days.  Of course, that's just about every day for me.  And it's not like anything I bought requires that much "cooking" anyway.    I could go on with this inanity, as I'm sure you'd all wish I would.  But my stomach is growling and Wendy's is beckoning me over to Third Avenue.

      For some reason, I feel the need to post something, yet I feel I don't have anything new or different or important to say.  So I am just going to keep typing until whatever it is that needs to get out gets out.  Then I will collapse into slumber.    I know I should be happy, upbeat, ready to go, but there are so many thoughts churning around in my head right now.  There are too many changes coming up, and while some of them are good and wonderful, and for the best, I feel that I don't want them to happen.  This is because I am selfish, and I am feeling fairly content about the state of certain things in my life, and I don't want them to get all stirred up and altered again so soon after finally being satisfied with them.  I know change is a natural part of life, and a huge part of me welcomes it, but there are some things that I wish could stay the same forever.  But they can't of course, and those are always the changes that come first.  Why do I have to be so complicated?  Why can't I be one of those people who do not dwell on thoughts like these?   Time goes by too quickly, and once it slips by it is gone forever.  There are so many opportunities that I have let slip away with the passing of time, and now I wish I could have all of them back.  Well, maybe not all of them, because that would be a little scary and tough to deal with all at once, but I do wish some of them would re-present themselves.  I want to be one of those people who doesn't look back, who merely looks forward, but unwieldy forces are always pulling me in the other direction.   I've even fallen out of my routines over the past couple of days.  Part of this has been because of my sheer busy-ness.  But also, I think that now that I have nothing to do - or at least I keep thinking I have nothing to do, so it's nice to know that I have no trouble deluding myself in some respects - I find that I am alone with nothing to do, which is the way it always is in the end.  I sometimes rather prefer being busy, for there isn't time to dwell on the internal, on the emptiness, for I am too busy focused on what needs to get done.  I do not know why this does not help to keep me buried in my work, or stop me from procrastinating, but it does not.  I must not be posting about the right things, because I am not really feeling any better.  When I should be feeling great.  Tonight was a good night.  Dinner with two of the best and most supportive people that I have the deepest pleasure of knowing.  Yet it was in leaving them that this uneasiness set itself upon me.  Perhaps it is just the loneliness again, and the desire for things never to change, or even for things to change back to the way they were.   But then, I think back, and I've always been like this.  This is the problem that I have always had.  Looking back, I always remember that I was content when I know somewhere deep inside that I was not.  So this gives me some comfort, that I have gotten through it before, that this has always been the way it has been, that this is just the result of being prone to introspection and self-doubt.  And I know, in that same deep down place, that everything will be OK.  Because it has too.    Even if one doesn't always get everything one wants.  There are any number of things that I want right now.  And I will probably get none of them.  And somehow, that is OK with me.  Because I've not gotten what I wanted in the past, and I've lived to tell the tale, and that's all one can ask for in the end.

      ...the First Draft, anyway.  It's nearly as long as it is supposed to be, and it isn't quite as wretched as I imagined it would be at this stage.  I've never worked so hard on writing anything in my life, and depsite that icky hangover feeling I have from lack of sleep, I feel kind of good about it.  Perhaps I can relax a little now.  At least I can relax about it - going in and fixing the problems that I know exist with it will not be too daunting a task, even with exams looming just over the horizon.  Today, I am going to try and relax as much as possible, but there is no rest for the weary as they say.  I've got to go to school, and for the second day in a row, my commute there will likely be longer than the time I actually spend there.  Well, actually, that's probably not true of today, but it certainly was yesterday.  But that's what happens when you put things off until the last minute.  So, my paper is done.  It's not that there weren't bumps along the way.  I finished just shy of 3 AM.  Would have been done sooner, but I hit a series of setbacks.  First, my computer froze and I feared loss of my draft or at least significant portions of it.  But God was with me so all was fine.  Then, the internet stopped working, so I could no longer conduct the research I needed to finish my paper.  But it finally came back on, and I got back to work.   I don't feel as elated as I thought I would, but I'm going to chalk that up to the fact that I am many other daunting tasks still to complete.  But I can at least relax a little bit this weekend, and that's a very good thing.

      Okay, so I'm getting ready to leave, and I look down at the schedule of when I'm supposed to meet with these people, and I realize that I have more time than I realize in order to get there.  So, I think to myself, wow, I have an extra 15 minutes.  Except, upon reflection, I really don't have any such thing at all.  I have 15 minutes now, but it is not like extra time has dropped itself into my day.  It'll have to come off the time I have later, and I really shouldn't feel like I have a minute to spare.  Yet here I sit, not working on my paper, not doing anything but typing this and watching The Weather Channel, because we all know its more important to avoid bad weather than it is to get our most important tasks done.  I am so frustrated with myself.  Yet three of those minutes have already gone by, and more will continue to do so, with me doing nothing of consequence, nothing I'm going to even remember at the end of the day, certainly nothing I would include in the biography of my day if it came to that.  And I continue to waste away the time, and waste away myself, for time is energy, and now I am awake and alive, and I should do things when I am like this, rather than at the end of the day when I am tired and deflated and unable to continue.  Yet I'm sure at 3 am I'll be sitting at this keyboard, just like I am now, only then I'll be typing for my life, trying to finish something that's due tomorrow.  And maybe the 15 minutes might seem small, but they really add up.  And every time I have some excuse:  oh 15 minutes isn't enough time to get anything done, oh I need to sleep later because I feel myself coming down with a cold, oh it's 10 pm and I'm never that productive at night.   If I'd used all of the 15 minutes that I've given up over the past semester, I'd certainly be less stressed now.  I wouldn't be behind in my school work, and I wouldn't have had to skip class to make up for it.  I wouldn't be going into April - the busiest month of the semester - further behind than I should be.  I'm actually looking forward to April, because I will no longer be saddled with this paper (or at least I will be less saddled with it - this is after all only the first draft), and I will be able to focus on the really important law school thing, which is preparing for exams.  It is indeed frustrating sometimes to be me, and to not be able to escape being me.  It's as if my own anger toward myself doesn't matter to myself.  There's a great internal struggle between me and me.  I don't believe in world peace, but I do at least think that my two warring selves should be able to work together, to co-exist.  After all, they are both me in the end, aren't they?

      Do yourselves a favor and read  urlLink this piece from the Opinion Journal by Jose Maria Aznar .  Regardless of where you stand on the war on terror issue, it is good to be acquainted with the best arguments from both sides, and this is one of the most thoughtful and passionate pro-war pieces I've ever read.  I have not blogged on the bombings in Spain in a while, but this article provides an informative summation of the events and the uncertainty that followed them with honesty.  Some highlights to entice you in:   The debates that followed the Madrid attacks have been about whether they were carried out by ETA or al Qaeda. It is obviously essential to find out who was behind the attacks. But all terrorism carries the same threat; all terrorist attacks are infused with hatred for liberty, democracy and human dignity. They feed on each other.   Up until the attacks of September 11, Spain took great pains to demonstrate to the outside world that terrorism was not an isolated phenomenon, that it shouldn't be fought by its immediate victims alone. Following the collapse of the Twin Towers, a new consciousness about the world-wide reach of terrorism finally emerged.  ETA or al Qaeda--the difference is important, to be sure, but the response to what has happened should be the same: firmness, political unity and international cooperation. Each and every democrat in the world was on those trains in Madrid. It has been an attack against all of us, against everything we believe in, and against everything we have built.

      Caught this fun little link over at  urlLink Crossing the Rubicon , and thought I'd give it a whirl.  So here are the  urlLink Wednesday Weird Ones , and my answers, on Tuesday:  1.  What would be the best and worst things about waking up one day and finding out you had been turned into a walrus?   Best:  I'd have an excuse and the ability to drop out of school. Worst:  No more quarts of Haagen Dazs Chocolate ice-cream.  2.  For whom does the bell toll?  More importantly, why does the bell toll?   The bell tolls for me, obviously.  It's really all about me.  And it doesn't need a reason to toll.  It just likes me.  That's it.  Just me and my bell.   3.  What are snakes afraid of?   Well, they should be afraid of my father, 'cause I've seen him cut the head off of one with an axe before.  But I don't think snakes are smart enough to be afraid of anything.  4.   Which is your favorite toe?  Why?   This is a tough one, because I try to love all my toes equally.  But since toes can't read, I guess I can play favorites here.  So I'd have to say the one next to my little toe.  I think it feels neglected.  The other toes get lots more attention.  I know how it feels.  5.   Was the movie Gremlins a morality play?  Explain.   Definitely not.  Heck no.  It is however a cautionary tale for kids.  Follow the rules?  No.  Take care of your pets or they might try to kill you.

      There is probably a total of one person out there (and, for all I know, this may just be myself) who will appreciate this, but I felt compelled to post nonetheless, as it amused me.  In reading for Evidence, I came across the case of   urlLink United States v. Owens  , which deals with an appeal based exclusion of evidence of prior out of court identification by the witness of the defendant as hearsay.  The relevant Federal Rule of Evidence provides that such evidence (an identification) is admissible if the person who made the I.D. is a witness at trial and subject to cross-examination.  This is a very long winded discussion, but I felt it was warranted, because after my  urlLink dismal performance on the Evidence quiz  yesterday, I feel the need to prove that I am learning something in this class.    Now, onto my point.  Justice Scalia wrote the opinion in the case, which held that the witness being subject to memory loss does not mean that he is no longer subject to cross-examination, so long as he still takes the stand and is willing to answer questions to the best of his ability on cross.  Anyway, those of you familar with Scalia will know that he fashions himself a literalist and prefers to say what the interpretation of a statute is by looking only at the language of the statute.  It is a noble endeavor (if not always practical), and it is one of the things I admire him for.  That makes his language in this case rather odd, for he actually relies on the Advisory Committee notes accompanying the rule instead of just the language of the rule itself in reaching his decision.  The Advisory Committee notes are not part of the text of the rule, and serve as scholarly interpretation of the rule only, though they are often cited with approval by courts.    To Scalia's credit, he later repudiated this reliance on Advisory Committe notes in his concurrence in a case entitled   urlLink Tome v. United States  .  He did not join the part of the majority opinion that made loving reference to the Advisory Committee Notes in support of the decision, and wrote:  "I have previously acquiesced in, and indeed engaged in similar use of the Advisory Committe Notes.  More mature consideration has persuaded me that is wrong."

      I just got this email from one of my law school friends, who is also my law school mom:   Good morning, Febs.  Just thought I'd let you know that today marks the chronological halfway point of our law school adventure.  Back on our third day of ILLP, already miserable, exhausted, and in search of excuses not to read (as I am at this moment), I decided to count the number of days from the first day of orientation until graduation.  In any case, my count is purely chronological, i.e., weekends, vacations, holidays, breaks, are included (I did, after all, have to read the burst balance wheel case that night).  The grand total was 882 days.  Today is day 441.  Good luck with the second half.   Perhaps some explanantions are in order for those of you who do not go to school with me:  ~Febs are what they affectionately call students who start law school in the spring semester at St. John's.  I believe this is because the semester used to actually start in Feburary, because exams were after Christmas in January.  This is, of course, no longer the way things are done, but the name has stuck.  ~ILLP stands for "Introduction to Law and the Legal Profession," which is a Pass/Fail class at the law school that basically clues you in on what this whole law school and lawyer thing is all about.  It starts the week before the other classes and its a brutal marathon.  I went into it with only two weeks between the end of my undergraduate career and the start of law school, and I cried and wanted to go home and wanted to give up.  And I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one who came close to it that first week.  Brutal, it was.  Brutal.  ~As a testament to how much I remember from that week, I have no idea what the balance wheel case is.  It is merely a vague recollection that rests in the back of my head that I once read something that involved it.  But nothing else comes to me.  Perhaps some of my more attentive classmates will refresh my recollection.  The important thing from this email is that I am halfway done.  This is much needed joyous news, and should do a lot to help me get through this week, which promises to be almost as brutal as the first one of law school.

      Try this on for depressing.  I fancy myself to be somewhat of an Evidence genius, yet I just majorly bombed one of the online quizzes the prof has online for us to take.  I am embarrassed that he is going to be reading my answers.  Some of them were so bad, and so wrong.  But at least it got me laughing at my own stupidity, which is never a bad thing.

      Today, I made significant progress on my paper.  Well, maybe not significant, but I did finish the section I was working on, so it gave me a big sense of accomplishment.  Now I just have to figure out what I am going to say next...

      Today, it's all about the feeding.  First, it is fish feeding off of each other.  My sister's boyfriend (and pseudo-fiance) bought her some fish to put in a fish tank that he had left over from when he used to not live at home with his parents, and gave them all to my sister to keep in her apartment (or, more accurately, her trailer).  He bought the ones that looked the best, but apparently they were all very "aggressive" fish and now, there is only one left.  All the rest are dead, having been attacked by what I can only assume is the meanest one of all.  I'm sure that this was incredibly upsetting when it happened to my sister, but I can't help but smile about it.  It's typical of my sister's foibles, and what makes her such an endearing person.  Later, I was walking down the street, after having made a run to the Bridgemarket Food Emporium for some Haagen Dazs chocolate ice-cream and a Pepsi and a Lean Cuisine dinner, and I started thinking about this latest funk I have found myself in.  And I started to get confused with the cause and with the effect.  Am I depressed because I don't do things?  Or do I not do things because I am depressed?  As soon as I think I've pinpointed it, I only get confused in tracing it back.  And I think that by doing so I miss the point.  Because it doesn't matter which causes which - the point is they feed off of each other.  And it's important to try to break the cycle.  And since it is hard to break out of the depression end of it because it's all in my head, I've been making a concerted effort to get out and do things, and keep up with my routines (as I've said before), and I think that this little mini-depression may be nearing an end.  I still feel stressed and overwhelmed, but as this is a normal law school feeling, I'm willing to accept it, and it is easier to deal with this.  So that's the state of things.  Tentative, but it's the best I can do at the moment.  My paper is coming along slowly.  I am not used to this kind of writing, or really even writing at all since I've been doing very little of it since coming to law school.  It's funny because everyone talks about how good writing is potentially the most important thing for a lawyer, yet we do very little of it in school.  Just moving closer to my belief that law school has very little to do with the practice of law.  But as I don't have the luxury of skipping over the school part, bear with it I must.  And back to it I must go.    I don't normally say this, but special thanks to all who have taken the time to read my thoughts here and comment on them.  It has probably not been so fun a task as of late, but it means a lot to me that even one person reads, sympathizes and understands.  So thank you to all of you, whether I know you or not.

      My Stupid Dog blogger Timothy Hulsey has a  urlLink very interesting review  of Errol Morris' film  Fog of War , which takes a critical (to put it politely) look at Robert McNamara and his involvment in foreign policy during his tenure with the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.  He also links to the text of Morris'  urlLink acceptance speech from the Academy Awards  where he actually thanked Robert McNamara, saying "...if he hadn't done it there would have been no film."  I confess I have not seen the film - mainly because I have not had the time.  But when I do get the time, I will see it, though it'll probably be out on video by then.  But it sounds to me like the art of propaganda is not dead; in fact, it is alive and well and, judging by the last two years' Best Documentary winners at the Oscars (this film and Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine last year), it is something that is more than tolerated.

      Thursdays have quickly become my favorite day of the week.  After the hell of the first three days, busy with classes and reading and schoolwork and everything else, Thursday, which is the one day I can sleep late and not make the trek out to school without feeling guilty, is a welcome reprieve.  Even now that I am bogged down with work, Thursday comes as a relief, for I can devote all my the hours of the day to getting things done without having to worry about going to class or accomodating others or any of those crazy things.    So today, that's what I've been doing.  I slept in, and then finally got my last Journal assignment to work on - so I've been busy with that.  Now I'm getting ready to attack my paper once again.  Hopefully all will go well with that effort, and I'll have some time later in the day to post something more meaningful.  Until then...

      I laughed nearly all the way home on my commute tonight.  It all started when I got on the train at Union Turnpike and pulled out my magazine, the April issue of Atlantic Monthly.  I began reading  urlLink this piece by Christopher Buckley , and it was very funny.  You should all read it, but some of the highlights:   Historically, you have to be careful interpreting royal gestures, or before you know it you're slicing up archbishops in the cathedral.   and:   The bottom line of my extensive research with the Oxbridge dons and the focus groups was that the English people value one quality above all else in their monarchs: killing the French.    I haven't finished the story yet, so perhaps I will come across more funny things to share.  The story is vaguely about Prince Charles hiring some American PR guy to help him change his image in Britian.  And yes, it's fiction.  In the story, he recounts the (true) incident in which a recorded phone conversation caught the Prince telling his mistress that he wanted to be reincarnated as a tampon...and I'm sure you can imagine the rest.  I remember hearing about this story, and finding it so ridiculously silly that it isn't even funny.  And thinking about it tonight, I just couldn't stop laughing.  Perhaps it is not kind to laugh at the misfortunes of others, but I couldn't help it tonight.  If I lived anywhere else but New York, I might have looked crazy, because the particular giggly humor of this didn't hit me until I was walking down the street.  So on I went, light snow falling, and me either burying my face in my overlarge turtleneck or covering my face with my gloved hands, laughing to myself and by myself.   And I'm finally in a good enough mood to go to sleep.

      Sitting in class.  Really shouldn't be blogging, but we are getting really bogged down in something that I already understand, so I'm taking a little break.  Plus I already got called on, so I'm safe for the rest of the class.  At least in theory.  I guess with my first name, and today being St. Patrick's Day, the prof thought I was Irish so he called on me.  But you heard it here first folks:  I am not Irish.  At least not wholly.  I've got a little bit of everything in my heritage, so for all I know there may be some Irish there as well.    It's been a long day.  Didn't sleep so well last night, so I got droopy earlier.  It was hard for me to get my work done.  A girl in the cafeteria later told me, when she saw me doing my reading, that it was no wonder I was so smart because I was doing my work.  When I expressed shock - not that I don't think I'm smart, but it is so often that we don't recognize it of others, especially for someone like me who doesn't speak that much in class and so often fumbles around when she does - she told me that she thought I was one of the smarter girls she'd met in the school.  It is nice to receive such unsolicited compliments completely randomly.  I post this not to pat my own back, but just because it really surprised me.  I don't even think most people know who I am here, and that gets frustrating, but this girl does know me, she actually remembers that she's met me and recognizes me, and that is gratifying in this world of perpetual strangers.    That said, why do we always put more stock in what total strangers tell us than what our friends tell us?  I know people who think I'm smart, but they are my friends, and when they say it, while I love and believe them, I take it with a grain of salt, because who wants to insult their friends, even if it requires a little fudging of the truth.  I don't have a ready answer to this question.  Now it is the break, and there are a sea of happy faces around me, engaging in playful banter and small-talk, enjoying each other's company, and generally having a good time.  And I feel very lonely and isolated among them.  I feel close to tears.  But I can't let myself cry, not now, not around all these people.  So I bury my head for a few moments, feigning frustration with the heat of the classroom, and avoid the eyes of others.  I take off my glasses so that I can't tell if other people are looking at me.  And luckily for me, class begins again before I have a chance to drive myself insane with these thoughts.  It's kind of funny to think of law school as keeping me sane, rather than driving me insane.  I think it's a little bit of both sometimes.  Okay, so that's over.  I feel much better now.  Guess I should get back to work, and actually start paying attention.

      Yesterday was good...I think.  It's kind of funny, because I have been lately taking comfort and refuge in my routine.  Normally those routine tasks that one has to do every day - getting up, washing your face, brushing your teeth - are more of a hinderance and an annoyance to me than anything else.  Now, I am relying on them, every small task I complete is reason to celebrate, reason to know that - despite all of my recent doubts - that I am going to make it, and more importantly, that I  can  make it.  Then this morning, despite my lack of sleep, I was able to get up when I was supposed to, able to force myself from the comfort of my bed to get out and face the day.  I was not able to do this last week, and that was on much more sleep.  So making myself do these menial things, relying on my routine, has helped me out greatly.  Even despite my awful commute this morning (sidenote to the rude guy on the bus:  you suck), I am in a good mood.  So there, icky depression, you have been driven away.

      Someone told me tonight that they found me brave.  Well, more accurately, they described one of my posts here as brave.  Only I don't feel very brave at all.  I feel like I'm hiding behind something, hiding from something.  I feel anything but brave...I hide behind my words here.  I post only to make myself feel better, but I'm not sure that many results are acheived by my doing so.  I feel like every day I merely continue to prove my own futility to myself.  That said, I made it through the day, painful spots and all.  It was a little up and down, but all in all, though I didn't get much work done, I did acquit myself in a fairly good fashion.  And tomorrow will be upon me before I know it.  So maybe I am brave, at least partially.  So many times over the past couple of weeks, with the piles of work building up and my decreasing lack of affinity for law school, I've seriously contemplated dropping out.  Yet in it I still remain.  I am still standing, if barely, and each day I continue to stand, though I may feel weaker, I actually grow stronger, because I know I can take it.  Now all I have to do is remember that at my darkest moments.  So here's to tomorrow, and may it be better than yesterday.

      Okay, so I had a fairly productive day.  It was not as much as I had originally planned, but given that I was hampered slightly by the lingering effects of my cold on my sinuses, I think that I should be cautiously pleased.  I have also set a new schedule for myself, so that means less blogging and more doing work.  But never fear, I will never abandon you completely, you who depend on the latest word from me...  If you see me blogging too much, feel free to leave nasty comments or send admonishing emails - I could use all the help I can get. ;)

      Okay, so I had a little change of plans this weekend.  Today I will take my long trek out to school in the hopes of getting some productive reading done.  I will be leaving my lonely computer behind, so chances are I will actually be able to get things done without the lure of the internet at my fingertips.  Expect an update tonight when I get home as to the level of my progress.  It's really starting to get scary now, when I think about the growing mountain of things I have to get done, so hopefully that scared feeling will stay with me and motivate me to be productive.  It hasn't failed me before.

      So there's this guy at school.  There's just something about him.  I can't exactly put my finger on it.  I wouldn't say he is per se attractive, but everything about him just appeals to me, from the way he dresses to his lean build to his somewhat familiar face.  He reminds me, if this is possible since I don't actually know him, of a character I made up for my as yet and never to be completed novel.  This is the thing that first drew my attention to him - his face, his demeanor, is reminiscent of a figment of my imagination.  And so I started to watch him, and become more engrossed.  When I don't see him for a while, his face fades away quickly, and I almost am able to forget about his existence.  But that is the hard thing about law school - it is a small environment where you see the same people day in and day out.  And while I don't see him as often as I used to, I still look for him in all the old familiar places (I used to see him haunting the first floor of the library when I did as well - and even though I don't sit there anymore, I still glance over nearly every time I walk in, half-thinking I'll see him there yet hoping I won't).    He's a third year, so pretty soon he'll be gone, and it's likely that I'll never see him again.  I don't know a thing about him, but I do so wish I did.  Every time I see him, the same thoughts wash over me.  First, I think I do actually know him - this is the old feeling of familiarity in his face.  Then, I think, I'd really like to talk to him.  But I never even say so much as a word.  I've never been one for small talk, and whenever a situation like this presents itself to me, I run and hide rather than take the step of speaking and introducing myself, or even just saying hi.  Fear overcomes me - indeed, it overwhelms me.  It makes me feel foolish and weak, for I have taught myself that it should, that I should be strong enough for anything.  But I'd rather hide behind the curse of anonymity than actually stick myself out there and take a chance.  From someone like myself, who has accomplished so much, it might seem strange to hear about fear.  Yet it pervades my every thought some days.  Fear that I won't have anything interesting or useful to say, fear that if I put myself out I will quickly be pushed back and out of sight, fear that I won't be wanted, fear that everyone will figure out that I've just been faking it all along - that I don't belong, that I'm stupid and weak and useless, or worse that they will think that I am all those things, even though I know I'm not, because of my complete inability to be witty or articulate.  These are my thoughts in my darkest hours.  And these are my thougths now, because they always come out the most when I am stressed and busy and concerned that I won't be able to get everything done, that I won't measure up.  I could kick myself now for all the time I've wasted.  And this is the story of my life: procrastination, then looking backward, wondering what I could have done or should have done differently, rather than looking ahead to what I can still accomplish with the time I have remaining.  And then the misery really begins to flow, and I think how I am alone, and always will be - not that this thought ever changes my behavior, because I still don't put myself out there, and still hold back the few times I get caught out there, when I've managed to drop my guard accidentally for a second and found myself in that scary unprotected place.    I thought for a brief shining moment when I first started law school, in my first semester, that all was well.  For the first time in my life, I was on top of things, working hard and meeting new people, and I truly felt like a different person.  And I thought that, in a very short while, I would be dating someone.  There was this guy - a different guy (as an aside:  there are more and more, the older I get, that I could actually see myself with - I used to think my standards were getting lower from being alone for so long, really for forever, but I think that it is more that I am growing up and into myself, and am becoming more realistic in my expectations of the world...but I digress), that I honestly thought it was going to happen with.  I felt so content and sure, which is odd for someone like me who so seldom feels sure about anything.  But I think I was mistaken, or at the very least, there was a moment when it was possible, but it just slipped through my fingers, and with moments like that, you never get more than one chance.  I fancied myself to be falling in love - and indeed, I think that it was the closest I've ever come to doing so, and I still have very deep feelings for this person.  Though, like everything else, they go unexpressed - denied even in the company of those who know us both - in the hopes that my ignoring them will make them go away.  I've gotten way off track with this post.  This is what happens when one gets out of bed with the intention of spilling her guts in the hope that it will help her fall asleep.  All of that hopeful feeling that I started last week with has dissipated.  Like everything else I want, it seems beyond my grasp.  And I have only myself to blame for that, because all things that are beyond my grasp are only there because of my stubborn unwillingness to go and get them.  I know this is true, and yet it doesn't make me change.  It is not in my nature to change, and it is the hardest thing to do, to fight against one's nature.  So on I trod, hoping to make little pushes here and there, to get a little bit closer, ever closer, even if I never reach the goal.  But there's one thing I know for certain - even after all this, I will not dare to speak to or initiate contact with the mystery man.  I will continue to just catch fleeting glances at his familiar face from afar, and try impossibly to content myself with this, until he disappears from my life forever like so many others before.    The only thing I know about him is his first name.  And that is all I will ever know.  UPDATE:  Just FYI, because I know that it will invariably happen, as people I go to school with who read this will try and solve the mystery, "Samuel" is not this person's real name, or anything even close to it - I have used the name of the character of mine that I talked about above instead, to protect the innocent.  Hey, I am still a law student after all - and I may sound crazy, but I'm not stupid as well.  And I'm feeling much better, as always, in the light of day.  Sometimes, I think that it isn't evil that God needs to save me from, but instead from those worse natures of myself.

      There will be very little (if any) blogging by me tomorrow.  It is going to be a day filled with trying to get as much reading for the week done as possible, so there will not be much time for anything else, such as finding fascinating things out there on the web or sharing my deepest and scariest thoughts with you.  Perhaps, if I have a really early and productive day, I will be back in the evening in all my splendid glory.  But I'll probably be too tired and cross-eyed from all the reading to think, let alone post.  But we shall see...Until then, a little quote from the Good Book to help remind us (meaning myself) of the task at hand:  Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth - Proverbs, 27:1

      This was too funny not to share, from P.J. O'Rourke, in Atlantic Monthly, on primary fever in New Hampshire:   Although John Edwards was held in high esteem, only the most ardent admirers of his "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" favored him at the polls.   Of course, Jonathan Edwards was a famous American preacher in the 18th century and is still studied today in American Literature classes around the country.  He was probably most famous for his sermons on the wrath and judgment of God, the most famous of these being " urlLink Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God "  A highlight from that work:   Your wickedness makes you as it were heavy as lead, and to tend downwards with great weight and pressure towards hell; and if God should let you go, you would immediately sink and swiftly descend and plunge into the bottomless gulf, and your healthy constitution, and your own care and prudence, and best contrivance, and all your righteousness, would have no more influence to uphold you and keep you out of hell, than a spider's web would have to stop a falling rock. Were it not for the sovereign pleasure of God, the earth would not bear you one moment; for you are a burden to it; the creation groans with you; the creature is made subject to the bondage of your corruption, not willingly; the sun does not willingly shine upon you to give you light to serve sin and Satan; the earth does not willingly yield her increase to satisfy your lusts; nor is it willingly a stage for your wickedness to be acted upon; the air does not willingly serve you for breath to maintain the flame of life in your vitals, while you spend your life in the service of God's enemies.   He's really a very wonderful writer, and even if you aren't religious or are and don't subscribe to his particular brand of religion, his sermons are worth reading for the language and imagery of them.  I really like the passage above.  Not all of his sermons are hellfire and brimstone, however.  There's this for example, from " urlLink A Divine and Supernatural Light ":   This spiritual and divine light does not consist in any impression made upon the imagination. It is no impression upon the mind, as though one saw anything with the bodily eyes. It is no imagination or idea of an outward light or glory, or any beauty of form or countenance, or a visible luster or brightness of any object. The imagination may be strongly impressed with such things, but this is not spiritual light. Indeed when the mind has a lively discovery of spiritual things, and is greatly affected by the power of divine light, it may, and probably very commonly does, much affect the imagination, so that impressions of an outward beauty or brightness may accompany those spiritual discoveries. But spiritual light is not that impression upon the imagination, but an exceeding different thing. Natural men may have lively impressions on their imaginations, and we cannot determine but the devil, who transforms himself into an angel of light, may cause imaginations of an outward beauty, or visible glory, and of sounds and speeches, and other such things. But these are things of a vastly inferior nature to spiritual light.   I know what you're thinking:  all of this just because I read some thing in a magazine and thought it was funny.  It IS funny, because O'Rourke's piece (sorry - I looked on  urlLink Atlantic Online  and it wasn't there yet) is all about how he didn't run into any real enthusiasts in New Hampshire for any candidate except for Dean.  It is also funny because it is not surprising that a bunch of New Englanders would think of Jonathan Edwards when hearing about some random Southern Senator named John Edwards.  There are too many people running around (past and present) with variations on this name:  the preacher, the Senator, that psychic guy John Edward.  Go here for  urlLink more sermons and info about Jonathan Edwards .

      Andrew Sullivan reports on the French (or at least some of them)  urlLink coming to their senses .  This is very encouraging indeed.   It's about time.    One question, though:  Does this mean I can't make fun of them anymore?  I think I'll reserve judgment on that one until it's not  Le Monde  but Jacques Chirac himself.

      Well, it seems that  urlLink Republicans for Kucinich  is disbanding before it even got off the ground, for the lone member (as far as I know...), Jeff Ellis,  urlLink cast his primary vote in Texas for President Bush .    Jeff gave me a little plug over at his blog, so I thought I'd return the favor.  He's linked over on the side, or you can just  urlLink click here .  His blog is really great: he has witty and interesting and diverse insights, and he is an excellent writer.  So stroll on over and give him your patronage.  You will not be disappointed.

      The Public Interest Auction last night had a Mardi Gras theme.  I found this strange for a couple of reasons.  First of all, Mardi Gras is not, by any stretch, a New York event, so kudos for my fellow students for thinking outside the box.  But, alas, Mardi Gras was in February, so it seems to be too late for the theme.  But at least they tried.  It was actually very nostalgic for me, because where I grew up Mardi Gras was a holiday.  So for a couple of hours tonight - despite the accents - I almost felt like I was at home.  I even got beads for purchasing raffle tickets.  It was actually a fun evening.  And me and some of my friends actually bid on something.  I think we must have been the only four people there who actually wanted this item (well, us and the other guy that was bidding against us - he looked older so he might have been an alum), since everyone else seemed to largely think we were insane for bidding.  Well, maybe there were others but they had trouble rounding up four people to go in on it.  We did as well; in fact, one of our fellow companions was a bit reluctant and only came in with us because he lost on some other thing he was bidding on.  So we will be going with one of our professors for a tour of a historic cemetery in Queens and then out to lunch.  I'm actually looking forward to it, because I'm a big history geek.    The one disappointment of the evening:  I didn't win the raffle this year.  I won it last year, and was hoping for a repeat, but alas, I missed out.  There's always next year...

      Someone asked me the other day, knowing I'm a sort-of conservative, how I felt about gay marriage.  And I told them that I didn't have a problem with it.  When pressed for elaboration, a strange thing came out of my mouth:  it would seem to me that instead of opposing gay marriage conservatives should support it.  Not only do I not think gay marriage is a bad thing, I actually think it is a good thing; it is something not to be opposed, but to be encouraged.  This is exactly the type of commitment that conservatives are always proposing; in fact, a lot of them support marriage incentives for the receipt of welfare benefits, which could have the effect of practically forcing people into marriage.  I think the difference is that conservatives have yet to accept homosexuality is here to stay.  Some crazy part in the back of their brain thinks that denial of this right might make it go away.  But homosexuality is a way of life that is here to stay, indeed it is a part of life that simply cannot be removed, and it seems to me that conservatives should accept this and move on.  And by moving on I mean that they should encourage marriage between homosexuals.  I'm not going to buy into the stereotype of gays being more promiscuous than straights, but if it turned out they were, who could blame them, given the fact that they are denied the most permanent and lasting form of commitment and monogamy that there is.  Sure they can still "practice" monogamy all they want, but without the protections of marriage I can simply see no incentive to do so.    Plus, it just doesn't make sense that any man and any woman can get married - and that this is something that conservatives approve of if not encourage (tracking back to the marriage incentives for welfare) - but that same level of commitment is denied to same sex couples.  Andrew Sullivan  urlLink posts a letter from a friend  (heading: Dan Gets Married) that reflects the silliness of it all very nicely:   "Sure," the license-department manager said, "If you've got $54, you can have a marriage license." ... It's not the marriage license I'd like to have, of course. But, still, let me count my blessings: I have a 10-year relationship (but not the marriage license), a house (but not the marriage license), a kid (but not the marriage license), and my boyfriend's credit-card bills (but not the marriage license). I don't know what a guy has to do around here to get the marriage license. But I guess it's some consolation that I can get a meaningless one anytime I like, just so long as I bring along a woman I don't love and my $54.   This is sheer insanity, people.  I don't expect the religious right to come to its senses anytime soon, and I don't expect they will even when it finally becomes legal, as it is bound to do.  Another thing to consider is that if they would back off, and not oppose it, and stay true to the "federalism" that the espouse, then the right to gay marriage might never be read into the Constitution's privacy protections.  But now that they are making it a national issue, and blowing it up on a bigger scale, a more liberal court might be inclined to do just that, and then the issue will go the way of abortion, when it should be left up to the states.  Ultimately, to me, it is not a constitutional battle; it is a political one.  True change should come this way; it is my view that the states should be able to come to it in their own time, and that eventually, they all will, even though it may not be in any of our lifetimes.  But if conservatives continue to make it such an issue, then my fear is that the meaning of the Constitution will be further eroded and that a right to gay marriage will be created where none exists.  And while I would not politically oppose the result, I would oppose the means.  And if that ever happens, I think the religious right will be to blame for being so vociferous and insane in the opposition.  UPDATE:  I've been giving it some thought, and I need to clarify my position on the constitutional question.  I would oppose the right to gay marriage being included in the right to privacy.  But there is another way for homosexuals to get the constitutional right to marry, and I would not (necessarily) be opposed to that route.  There is a potential Equal Protection argument to be made, and it might not even require a change in the level of scrutiny that the Court applies.  In  Lawrence v. Texas  (the sodomy case the Court decided last year), one of the rather bizarre statements the Court made was that morality could not serve as the basis for law.  This would mean that even under a rational basis test, the law would fail.  This is basically what happened in Lawrence, even though that was not an Equal Protection case.  The issue with Equal Protection there was that if the Court said the  Lawrence  law was unconstitutional because it only forbade same sex sodomy and not heterosexual sodomy (which the law in fact did), then there was the fear that states would then rewrite their laws to make them non-discriminatory on their face.  There might then be a potential problem of application, i.e. if the states had a neutral law but only enforced it against homosexual, but I think the Court would not have favored a uniform application of the law any more than an unequal one, so they went with privacy instead.  The issue of marriage does not have the same problems, as no state is likely to rewrite the laws to prevent marriage by everyone, or to enforce such a law equally should they choose to do so.  And given that the main justification for these laws is morality, the Court could say that there was no rational basis for the law, thereby still applying the lowest level of scrutiny to strike down the law.  The Court signaled in  Lawrence  that their decision would have no impact on marriage, that marriage was a different question, but with a different Court...

      Well, the auction is about to commence here at St. John's.  We are about T-10 minutes from the fun and frivolity of it all.  It feels weird to do it on such a sad day.  But as it will raise money to help students who want to commit themselves to public interest work, I can see the purpose and the good in it.  Plus I've been authorized to purchase raffle tickets for one of my absentee classmates.  So, I guess I'm off to it.

      Though we all feel in our hearts for what Spain is going through, these latest attacks have had a  urlLink more direct impact  here at home in the stock market, which fell 168.44.  The experts attribute this fall to the bombings themselves as well as the fact that the French have raised their terror alert in response to the bombings.  The French are starting to take the threat to the world seriously, now that it is hitting so close to home.  Their concern only heightens my belief that this is possibly not the work of ETA.  Why would the French be scared of them?

      My Mom told me about  urlLink this dreadful story from back home  last night when I called to see how she was doing:  a man killed a woman who was his ex-girlfriend and then killed himself.  This in itself may seem unremarkable in our age of terror and violence.  But the woman's five year old daughter was in the house at the time of the shooting.  This little girl is one of my mother's students (for those who don't know - my mother owns and runs a dance school and teaches ballet there), and there are things that are not in the article (or anywhere else for all I know) that make this story particularly heartbreaking.  The man shot her mother in the driveway, then went back into the house, where he saw the little girl.  He waved at her, pulled the gun out from behind his back, and shot himself right in front of her.  This poor little girl is going to be traumatized by this terrible event for quite some time.  If you are the praying type at all, perhaps you'll want to throw one in for her and her remaining family.

      There are now reports that  urlLink al-Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the Madrid bombings .  There is no way to assess the credibility of this claim thus far.  But it is not the only evidence available.  Perhaps the most damning account is from UPI, making a  urlLink persuasive case that this is the work of al-Qaeda .    One telling thing from the UPI article comes at the end, when a German intelligence officer is quoted:  "[N]ow the war has reached Europe."  Uh, I'm pretty sure the war reached Europe already.  This war has touched many countries and many lives, and it will continue to do so until it ends.  I said in an earlier post that, if this was the work of al-Qaeda, then hopefully this will help open the world's eyes that this is not just an American problem.  Now, I would alter that statement slightly:  I hope that it will help  remind  the rest of the world that this isn't just an American problem.  I started out the day believing that this was the work of Basque insurgents.  I now stand, perhaps not convinced, but with one foot in the other camp.  Only time will tell, but either way this event should alert us that there is a threat out there, no matter where it comes from, and it is growing.  I fear the worst - that it is happening all over again.  And it is, no matter who is responsible.

      Let me tell you a little story about my brilliance.  Earlier today, I strolled over to Gail's blog, Crossing the Rubicon, as I do every day, and I found  urlLink this entry from her  about Kerry's branding of the entire Republican party as "the most crooked, you know, lying group I've ever seen."  I quickly responded with a comment, the entirety of which may be found at the same link, wrapping up by saying "nice to know that Kerry is not so "nuanced" as to get caught up in the finer details of Republican character."    Later in the day, I opened my email to find  urlLink today's Best of the Web , where James Taranto writes in response to this statement by Kerry:  "John Kerry has finally said something that wasn't nuanced!"  We already knew James Taranto was brilliant and insightful.  Who knew I was as well?

      There seems to be a general dispute as to whether  urlLink the terrorist bombings in Spain  are the result of the ETA or al-Qaeda.  To me, it matters only so far as the Spanish need to know who is responsible for the purposes of justice.  And it matters so that the world can know what the threat is.  But it doesn't matter in another sense - the war we are fighting now is not the war against al-Qaeda.  It is the war against terrorism, and that, to me, means all terrorism, regardless of the name or form it takes.  No matter whether it is the same people responsible for 9/11 or not, we should express solidarity and support for Spain and the Spanish people.    UPDATE:  Maybe this is too early to say, as it's just in and its reliability could be questioned, but several news outlets are reporting  urlLink something like this :   A van with detonators and an Arabic-language tape of Koranic verses were found near Madrid, Interior Minister Angel Acebes said Thursday, opening new lines of investigation into the train bombings. So far, the probe has focused on the Basque separatist terror group ETA.   No idea what it means...yet.  But as it's related, and this is a matter of pressing importance, I thought I'd post it.  If this is indeed al-Qaeda, I hope it will awaken the rest of the world that this is not just an American problem.  And if it is ETA, then I hope that it will awaken the world to the disparate treatment and hypocrisy of European reaction to this in comparison with the terrorist attacks perpetrated by the Palestians in Israel.  Things like this shouldn't have to happen for us to take stock of what is going on in the world.  When will the politicians finally start to listen?  UPDATE II:  Just a small  urlLink squib from Reuters  on the latest developments.  One thing stands out:  the reference to "Islamist militants" instead of calling them "terrorists."  This may seem like no big deal, but I think it just goes to show that some people will never get it.

      ...I've been busy as heck.  Perhaps a slight rundown is in order, since my absence was prolonged:  Tuesday night was the Journal of Legal Commentary Alumni Dinner.  It was not as bad as I thought it was going to be.  I was not looking forward to this event at all, but it was actually kind of nice.  The food was good (it was at Trio, a restaurant in NYC on 33rd between Lexington and 3rd - run by a St. John's Law School and Journal alum), I finally got to meet some of the people on the Journal, and the conversation was nice and actually veered away from the standard law school fare of classes, professors, and complaining about the amount of work.  There was a speaker - Judge Carmen from the Court of International Trade - and he was good as well, though I was sitting at a very odd, uncomfortable angle throughout his speech.  Wednesday is normally my worst day, but yesterday was even worse than normal.  My alarm didn't go off, so I missed my first class.  Then, I had a rather unpleasant commuting experience, which is probably not fit for blogging.  Then a full day of hurring through my journal assignment and re-reading the Evidence stuff for class.  Found out that, as usual, the school doesn't tell us anything, and that registration for the summer (when I have to take class, having started in January instead of the Fall like all the other 2Ls) starts on Monday.  More unpleasantness ensued with that.   Finally, I got home and called my Mom, easily the best part of the day.  I watched a little HBO - for once, Bill Maher did not annoy me to death.  Then, I snuggled up in bed and drifted off to sleep.    And now we're at today.  I'm waiting for this lady from school to call me back, and so far she hasn't, so I'm a little bit annoyed by that.  But I suppose there is still time.  Only there isn't, since if I want to do an Externship this summer (I figure if I'm not getting paid for work I might as well at least get credit) I need to meet with the professor by tomorrow, and if she doesn't call me back, it's going to be hard to schedule a meeting.   I may have to take matters into my own hands and just go up to the office to schedule it in person.  But since I've got 10 million other things to do, this prospect annoys me slightly.  But we shall see.  Tonight is the Public Interest Auction at the law school.  Should be a fun time.  And this time I plan on being sober enough to remember most of it, so that's even better.

      I had a really witty and informative post all ready to go, but somehow when I went to post it, it magically disappeared.  This is all that remains of it, and I still do not understand how this much of it survived:   In today's segment of St. John's Law School Hall of Shame, we are transported (rather unmagically, I'm afraid, by the intake of too much Mountain Dew) to the ladies restroom on the 1st floor of the library, where I just rather remarkably encountered two girls having a giggling conversation while standing in front of two of the three avai   I'm sure you can all see the makings of yet another wonderful post from me.  Perhaps if I have energy later, I will try to recall my brilliance.  But it is never as good the second time around.  Light on the blogging today I know, but had and have big plans to attend to.  Finishing up my Journal assignment, and then off to the Journal dinner.  Not looking forward to it at all - but I'm starving, so at least there will be something to eat.  Not that I didn't already pay through the nose for it.

      From Gail at Crossing the Rubicon, there is  urlLink some seriously disturbing news  of anti-Semitism from Alan Dershowitz.  Here's just a short bit:   One sign carrier shouted that Jews who support Israel are worse than Nazis. Another demanded that I be tortured and killed. It wasn't only their words; it was the hatred in their eyes. If a dozen Boston police were not protecting me, I have little doubt I would have been physically attacked. Their eyes were ablaze with fanatical zeal...   See the link above for more, and go  urlLink here  for the whole piece by Dershowitz.  This reminds me of my days at NYU, where it was unusual - though not unheard of - to hear similar things.  I remember one thing in particular, though I don't remember many of the particulars, when, after 9/11, one of the Arab groups on campus associated their organization with a letter from notorious bigot and anti-Semite David Duke.  Here's an  urlLink editorial from the Washington Square News  (NYU's campus newspaper) on the affair, with some more details.  The student who was responsible for disseminating the letter later withdrew it, claiming that she did not know who David Duke was.  I make no observation about the veracity of her claim, so for now we will just say that she was negligent in not investigating anything about the background of the person who wrote the letter before putting it out to the public as representative of her organization.  This is bad enough.  That and the association with the content of the letter itself.  I have noticed though a trend for those on the left, who are generally pro-Palestinian, to let their support of that cause to bleed over into anti-Semitic furor, especially since 9/11.  It seems that the left's tolerance only goes so far.  I was raised as a conservative Christian, and I was raised to respect Jews and to support Israel.  My grandfather has studied and related aspects of Judaism and Jewish culture to me.  I heard much about the grand Judeo-Christian tradition of which I was a part.  Perhaps my upbringing was unusual for someone with similar Christian right tendencies.  But I think it might be more common than some realize, particularly the support for Israel.  And I think that is kind of interesting.

      From Electablog, a  urlLink very funny observation  on Bloomberg's confusion over whether gay marriage should be legalized:   Mayor Bloomberg came out pretty clearly in favor of a NY state law that would legalize gay marriage. Then he sort of came out against. And then for. And then against. By the end of the evening, I wouldn't have been surprised to see him toking on a cigarette at a local bar.

      The Telegraph has some  urlLink interesting letters written by the late actor, John Gielgud  - I especially enjoyed the one to Claire Bloom about the death of Richard Burton.    This has got me thinking, though - no one really writes letters anymore.  This was one of the thoughts that ran through my mind last night as I was lying in bed unable to sleep.  I thought about my dear friend Christina, who is probably going to be starting graduate school at Vanderbilt in the Fall - and how I was going to have to harrass her with loads of emails since I won't get to see her on a regular basis anymore, Nashville being a long way from New York City.  I've been called a fairly good email writer by some - it's probably only because I truly enjoy writing and it is how I communicate most effectively, but even though I think email has in some ways revived the writing of letters to a degree, I think that people use it more as a quick way to get information to others rather than a meaningful channel of communication and correspondence.  Unless of course, you're me.    But I fear that all these collections of letters that are constantly being published will one day die out completely, because people don't really do them any more.  I write long emails to keep in touch with friends and acquanitances, but I don't even save any of them.  I think that's why email will never be like letters - there is something very impermanent about all things related to cyberspace:  links die, email addresses change, and since it is an informal and anonymous way of staying in touch, people tend to lose touch easier, especially if there is no connection between them outside in the "real" world.    I think it's sad that people don't write letters any more.  Then again, I'm a bit much on the nostalgia, and often say I was born in the wrong time.  So this may just be a part of that.  But I think that if people wrote more letters, they'd have no other choice than to become better writers.    On a related note, I think I'm going to start writing open letters to various people - people I like, or people I don't, famous people or someone I saw on the subway who interested me - and putting them here for all (if all is the four people who read this blog - and the occasional stragglers who stumble upon it) to read.  No idea when or who...it'll be random I'm sure.  I'd ask for suggestions, but judging how well the epic poem thing went...well, perhaps I'll just handle it on my own.

      Well, not exactly, but here's a  urlLink little follow up  on the economic development of the place where they filmed  Cold Mountain ...in Romania.  It's funny but before I saw the movie, when I found out where it was filmed, I must admit - as a proud Southerner (well, sort of) - I was shocked and bothered.  But the scenery in the film wasn't bad and didn't look un-Southern, and I was even looking out for it.  Eventually through the movie, I began to forget completely about the fact that it wasn't filmed in the South - or anywhere near - at all.  Of course, this may be less because it ceased to bother me and more because other things about the movie began to bother me more, but honestly it looked OK to me.  Partially because, as this article points out, it would have been...difficult (but certainly not impossible) to actually film in the United States because of the development that has gone on there, and also because the story takes place in the northern part of the South (Virginia? Or North Carolina?), which while it certainly doesn't look like Romania, certainly looks less like the flatness of the Mississippi Gulf Coast where I grew up.     Update :  For the Jude Law fans among us - and I do know who you are - scan down to the bottom of the article, as there is the slightest mention of him.

      Okay, so last night I think I had some kind of a breakthrough.  It's hard to evaluate such a moment when you are still in the wake of it, but I think I might be right.  Last night, I did something that I haven't done in a very long time.  As I was lying in bed, this overwhelming feeling of dread and anxiety began to fill my stomach.  My heart started to pound very fast, and I felt genuinely scared.  So, for some strange reason, I said aloud, "I'm sorry, but this is something I have to do," and I got out of bed, knelt next to my bed, and began to pray, prostrate over my bed and before God.    It's not that I don't ever pray, it's just that I've never been very good at prayer unless there was some sort of external crisis going on, like sick relatives or problems with friends.  I've always prayed for other people, but never really for myself.  This might seem strange to some, and it certainly seems strange to me.  I've always thought of myself as a Christian - certainly not the best or more pious out there, but it's something that I've rarely questioned.  But I guess that was the problem - sometimes, I think it's easier for people who aren't brought up religiously, who come to it on their own, because it somehow means more to them.  Me, it was always something that was a part of my life - so I think I've taken it for granted.  Only recently did I think I really understand for the first time how awesome a power and force it could be in my life.  And I think it all finally came home to me last night.  For the first time when I was having a personal, internal problem and conflict, it occurred to me to actually ask God for help.    So I got out of bed, down on my knees, and began to pray.  And I cried as I did.  I cried at the simplicity of this action, at my own stupidity and ungratefulness, for my complete ignorance in not realizing this thing was before me.  I prayed for a while, falling upon great moments of silence as I fumbled through unfamiliar ground, ground that shouldn't have been unfamiliar to me at all.  And after I was done, I felt the most amazing feeling of peace.  I don't honestly think I've ever felt like that before.  I asked for God's help, and for once, I didn't feel weak doing so - or, more accurately, I did feel weak but I realized that it was okay, that it was the whole point.  I am weak.  I am weak and I need help and I shouldn't be afraid or ashamed to ask for it.  I had asked God to calm my mind, and when I got back into bed, I found that it was calm.  It still took me a while to get to sleep - as it always does - but the thoughts running though my mind were not harried thoughts of the millions of things I had to get done and hadn't.  They were pleasant thoughts, silly thoughts, thoughts completely mundane, or dreams of things I still long to accomplish.  But the stress was not there, the agonizing over how I am going to get through another day, of the piles of things that went undone as I fritted away my time this weekend, just like every other weekend.  These thoughts were nowhere to be found.  I woke up tired, but not plagued with doubt and dread about starting another week.    I do not want you to think that these thoughts are all I have been having.  It is indeed the rare occurrence (usually Sunday nights, when I am at my most stressed and unhappy now that the relaxation of the weekend has passed and another week of things to do is upon me), but when it has happened before, I've not had any recourse but to lay there staring at the ceiling, doing nothing, hoping for it to pass from me so that I could get to sleep, since no one likes to face Monday tired as well as grumpy.   But last night I fought back, fought back against the force of woe with the only weapon I have, the only one I know, and the only one truly strong enough to fight.  My faith took an enormous leap last night.  It may be too soon to say that my life has changed - but at the same time, I don't think it is too soon, because any further acceptance and recognition of God's love and power has to be an important occurrence in one's life, certainly more important than the trifling deadlines and pesky classes and general duties of my existence.  This morning I came to school really happy, really charged and ready to be here, even though I was majorly unprepared for my classes and dreadfully behind in many things.  And I haven't felt like that...well, ever that I can remember in my existence.  So I think that it is something...something big and exciting and unforgettable.    I already owed God so much.  And now I owe Him a little bit more for proving Himself to me when it was unnecessary for Him to do so.  I cannot repay the debt, that is for sure - but at least I can make it worthwhile.  I can make it mean something.  And from now on, I will try to do my best to do so.  I may often fail, but I've no doubt that, in the end, I will succeed, flourish, and prosper.

      Just when  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  was starting to get me down,  he  urlLink posts this  on his blog today.  Money quote (as he would say):   My stomach lurches at the thought of another terror attack while Kerry is president. What would be his first response: reach for a dog-eared copy of the early Sartre? Look, Eliot is a spectacular poet. I've read him year after year after year. I dramatized the "Four Quartets" at Harvard. But that's not a qualification for the presidency.   There's simply nothing I don't love about this quote.  Eliot's my favorite poet, hands down, and the stuff about Kerry is right too.  Then, to top it off, Sullivan provides this Kerry statment, quoted in an  urlLink op-ed piece by Maureen Dowd  (this will probably be the last time I post a link to anything by her, so don't get used to it, but it really is kind of an amusing read):   "I remember flying once; I was looking out at the desert and I wrote a poem about the barren desolation of the desert. I wrote a poem once about a great encounter I had with a deer early in the morning that was very moving."   Look, I'm a writer myself, and I've written poetry from time to time.  But if I ever said anything as remotely silly as this about something I'd written, I'd have a lot to apologize for.  And I'm not running for President.  To quote Sullivan:  "Oh God.  Four years of  this ?"

      Another Sunday arrives, and yet again, I find myself completely unready to face the week.  But since I don't really have much of a choice on that score, I should probably spend the rest of today getting as close to ready to do so as I can.  I have a little residuals of sickness - like my constantly needing to be blown nose - but otherwise I'm feeling better, if not great.  I have still been sleeping lots in hopes that the sickness will not return, but I do not think it will at this stage.    Now that it is March, this is when things get (or should get) really serious with school.  Like today, I have many things I need to do, and will begin doing as soon as I finish this.  No matter how much I get done, I always think it is never enough.  This weekend it is especially not enough, since I am so behind from missing most of last week.  But everything will be okay.  I had a dream last night that I had a class that I had completely forgotten about and had neglected to attend the classes all semester.  I've had this dream at least once before.    Well, it's off for a day of work, then perhaps a slight relaxation by 8 PM - and then it's to bed to let the week truly begin.

      From  urlLink Drudge :  once again, the cable news networks, in the rush to be first and report things the second they happen,  urlLink get it wrong , this time on the Martha Stewart verdict.  I myself saw it on MSNBC, and they did indeed call the first count "not guilty" and flashed a graphic reporting it as such before correcting themselves.  It struck me as ironic watching all these reporters stream out of the courthouse just as quickly as they could after the verdict was read, looking like complete idiots as they tried to communicate to their colleages in their own special way what had happened.  Of course, I sat there like a fool watching it, so I guess I'm their target audience.  And I must say too that something about all that confusion and chaos made it sort of exciting.  That said, I wouldn't have been injured in any way if I'd had to wait a few more precious seconds to hear the news, and that's all it would have taken for them to get it right.  As for the verdict, I must say I was surprised.  I haven't followed the case that closely, but from everything I have heard and read, the prosecution's case was weak.  It just goes to show that you never know what a jury is going to do, so it is best to avoid them to begin with.  In an informal poll in my Evidence class on Monday, most people seemed to think she would be convicted of  something  - even I thought she would be - but I didn't think they'd get a conviction on all four counts.  This probably means, that barring any favorable decisions for her on appeal, she will probably do some jail time.  Most experts say around a year to 18 months.  Very surprising indeed, in my admittedly uninformed sense.

      Gary sat in class, a furrow spreading across his brow. Hiding behind his laptop, but his moment, it was here. The prof's bony finger picked his name off of the list And croaked, "Mr. Borrelli, would you please recite this case?"  And yes, if you must know, I am sitting at home on a Friday night, writing an epic poem about one of my classmates (hey, he was the only taker on my whole epic poem idea - I can only work with what you people give me - plus I rather like it thus far, though at four lines it's not seeming very epic).  Want to make something of it?

      As soon as I start feeling better, the weather starts to stink again.  It has been, from what I've been told (since I've seen very little of it first-hand from my window overlooking the building next door while sick in bed) some of the best weather New York has seen in a while this past week.  And I missed out on it, being ill.  But today, I feel well enough to venture out, and it was cool and foggy and wet and rainy and...yes, even icky.  Made me wish I hadn't gotten out of bed at all.

      Well, I think the worst of the icky cold is over.  Sorry to all for my overuse of the word "icky" over the past couple of days.  But I just like the way it sounds, and it just about perfectly describes the way I feel.  I had a very good night's sleep (although I was up a bit too late), but I awoke this morning from a rather strange dream to find myself nearly choking with coughs.  This was quite an inauspicous start to the day.  But hopefully it will get better from here.  I feel okay, and I haven't even had my medicine yet.  Plus, the planned trip to Wendy's for lunch is upcoming - it will be my first time out of doors in over 24 hours.  Hopefully, I won't be attacked by another sneezing fit, or I'm liable to be arrested for something - it seems just about everything is illegal in New York City nowadays.  They've already gotten rid of smoking in bars (which is really quite lovely because now, living on a street with many such establishments, I get to walk down a gauntlet of smoke every evening), so I'm sure sneezing cannot be far behind.

      I jest a little with the title, but having strolled over the Jeff Ellis's blog today, I find that his self-described Libertarian/Republican self is  urlLink on the verge of casting a vote for Kucinich .  Now I find this to be rather strange, but I share with deepest sympathy Jeff's basic point of frustration - a frustration I also felt in 2000 - that this election is calling out for someone who will truly lead, truly inspire, who will dare to put forth a concept for what this country could and should be, rather than just saying whatever they think their party base will want them to say, or weaving from left to center depending on whether they are trying to win the nomination or the Presidency.  I too admire Kucinich, because he has the bravery to stand up and say what he thinks.  Now, I almost always disagree with what comes out of his mouth, but his veracity is a rare find in politics these days.  Perhaps it is the fact that he really has absolutely nothing to lose that makes him speak without fear; I like to think that it is the fact that it is just the way he is.  I am reminded of one of the Democratic debates I saw months ago, way back when everyone in the world was vying for the Democratic nomination, when one of the moderators asked each of the candidates to say one unpopular thing they would do if he (or she - we musn't forget Carol Mosely-Braun) were President.  Most of the candidates, including all the biggies - Dean, Kerry, Edwards - fumbled over themselves, saying that they would stand by their principles, but not being incredibly specific.  Only two of the candidates that I recall (though I must admit my brain is somewhat foggy on the details) were willing to say specific things that sounded remotely unpopular: Lieberman stated his basic committment to continue the fight that President Bush has been waging, the war on terror (which may not be all that unpopular, but considering Iraq has been a big issue in the Democratic primary, probably didn't do too much to gain him support) & Kucinich started off by saying that he opposed the death penalty, and then continued to list a whole other host of things that were truly unpopular - I can honestly say that I probably didn't agree with a single one of them.  But he actually answered the question, which almost no one else did.  And he gained a little bit of my respect that night.  But there are tons of people that I respect that I would never vote for.  And since I can't really watch Kucinich for more than five minutes without getting annoyed with what he is saying and changing the channel, I probably would find it difficult to cast my vote for him.  A lot of it comes down to personality with me, and if I can't stand looking at the guy for the next four years, then he's probably not going to get my vote.  This is what ultimately led me to not vote for Al Gore.  It's sad that this is the way politics works, but it is just the same.  I don't know who I'll be voting for come November, but whoever I do vote for, I cannot say that it will be with much enthusiam.  It might end up being the lesser of two evils, I might end up voting for Bush despite my reservations against him because of the importance of the war and my lack of confidence in Kerry to be up for the task in the way I think it should be pursued, or perhaps I'll end up voting third party again.  But it will be done with a heavy heart.

      Well, I've got some drugs in me, and have had for quite some time, so I'm feeling a little more functional, if not better.  The left side of my nose kept me awake last night, it kept getting all stopped up again and again, no matter how many drugs I used to combat it.  I didn't get as much sleep as I would have liked, but today, I have things to get done, so here I sit, at my computer, toiling away.  Perhaps I'll even feel up to posting outside the context of my icky sickness later on today.

      Well, I took some DayQuil, and the fog that has addled my brain seems to be lifting somewhat.  So perhaps the worst is over.  My roommate, who means well, suggested I take a walk earlier and get some fresh air, but I only succeed in sneezing my way up and down the streets of New York, insulting New Yorkers with my sickness invading their space.  I bought some coffee, which brought a temporary relief to my sore throat, but not to my sneezes, so on my way home I'm sure I managed to alienate those few friendly New Yorkers still in existence out there.    I finally broke down and bought the drugs though, so at least my cold should be a little more bearable now.  Somehow, the cold made the trek up to my head quite suddenly, without my knowing it.  I can handle the hacking coughs, but once it reaches my sinuses, I need drugs to clear my head.  And so I went to Duane Reade to get some.  I spent a small fortune, but I think it was worth it.  Hopefully, the end of this cold is near, and it will die a horrible quick death really soon and just leave me all alone again.    Unfortunately, my day was not very productive.  But I got a lot of rest, so hopefully that will help, and tomorrow I can begin to function like a normal human again.

      Okay, so the icky sickness has chosen to get worse and not better.  I couldn't even move when my alarm went off this morning.  So I'm taking another day off.  I hate missing this much school, especially at this point in the semester, but given that I can barely talk or think, perhaps it is for the best.  Thanks for the well wishes everyone...except for Gary, who has been very mean to me ;-)...they have made me smile and brightened up my sickness filled days just a bit.

      It is amazing how much one can sleep when one has a cold.  Taking the day off, trying to recoup.  But even a day off isn't completely a day off, so I'll be doing some work as well.  But mostly sleeping.

      I am deep in the midst of getting a cold.  I am going to be sleeping lots and blogging less, hoping to ward it off as best I can.  Also going to be blogging less because my roommate's computer crashed, and my internet connection from home is dependent upon hers.  So for now, it's just from school for me, and as I'm trying to be more productive at school...let's just say, if you don't hear from me, never fear...I shall return soon enough (perhaps too soon for the likes of many of you).

      Well, I didn't do too badly on predictions.  My going out on a limb for Best Actor backfired, but as Sean Penn was very gracious in his acceptance speech, only throwing in one joking reference to the lack of WMDs to be found in Iraq, I am willing to not be too upset about this.  I think he probably deserved it more anyway.    Lord of the Rings  won everything, so the few times I strayed from that strategy didn't pay off too well.  I really didn't think it would win for Screenplay, and on Costumes...what can I say.  I also missed on some of the other categories, most notably Documentary - but in retrospect, I should have chosen  Fog of War  instead.    All in all I found the awards show to be very boring.  There were no surprises, but there were some funny moments along the way, and watching it with friends never hurts.  Perhaps I will have more to say on it later.  Right now I have to get to work.   UPDATE :  I predicted 17 categories correctly, by my count.  Those I missed:  Best Actor (Sean Penn), Best Documentary Feature (Fog of War), Best Documentary Short (Chernobyl Heart), Best Animated Short (Harvie Krumpet), Best Costume Design (Lord of the Rings), Best Cinematography (Master & Commander), Best Adapted Screenplay (Lord of the Rings).

      I feel that there is something more I have to say on this film, because it is something that is weighing heavily upon my heart and mind, and I have been largely trying to ignore it, but to no avail, so I am going to post on it, and hopefully I will feel better and will be able to think on it introspectively, without turning it into the sole focus of this blog.  First off, I'd like to say, that reading the wide variety of responses out there to the film, that my own thoughts on it are something akin to those of  urlLink Roger Ebert , from both a filmic and emotive standpoint.  His is actually one of the most thoughtful and reasoned approaches to the film that I have thus far encountered.  It is difficult for me to be reasonable in my approach to this, because it is an emotional and spiritual question that goes to the very core of my faith and identity, so sometimes I wonder when I read some of the vicious attacks of the film and of Gibson personally that are floating out there, some of which are from circles that I normally admire and agree with, I have to wonder if my emotions are getting the better of my judgment.  Then, I read such thoughtful and reasonable opposition on Gail's blog,  urlLink Crossing the Rubicon , and I see that this cannot possibly be the case.  As a case in point, I feel that  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  - who I normally appreciate above all else (I've given money to support his blog, and I read it daily, and always leave wanting more) - has been incredibly unreasonable on this issue.  Today, on his blog for instance, he has two entries that I find devoid of all meaning and relevance to the issues at hand.  The first can be  urlLink found here  (scroll down to the heading "Gibson on Non-Catholics"), where he notes that Gibson thinks that all non-Catholics (and presumably all those Catholics who don't share his particular view of pre-Vatican II Catholicism, though this is a guess on my part) are going to Hell.  First of all, I fail to see the relevance of this statement to anything.  So the guy has a particularly wacky, exclusive view of Christianity.  He is certainly not the only one.  It is in the nature of most religious belief to be exclusive in one way or another.  What matters is how those people treat others, regardless of whether they believe that person to be destined for Hell or Heaven.  Christianity teaches that God loves everyone ("God so loved  the world  that he gave his only begotten Son") regardless of whether they love His back or even believe in His existence.  Perhaps Mel Gibson doesn't believe this either, and this would be a valid line of attack against him.  But what Sullivan poses has no relevance whatsoever other than a silly attempt to make him look like a bad guy.  And for all I know he is.  But let's at least try to prove that with things that matter.  Second of all, this is old news, as I remember reading these quotes months ago in an interview Mel Gibson gave with the  New Yorker .  And I seem to recall vaguely from the Diane Sawyer interview that he made a statement that contradicted this (I do not remember the exact content, but I do remember thinking it was odd because I remembered the earlier statement from the interview - perhaps I will look into it if I have the energy after this post and update accordingly), so perhaps this is something that he really doesn't believe, or perhaps it is something that he has reconsidered, or perhaps he just thinks that saying it publicly makes him look bad.  The main point is Gibson has said a lot of crazy things and done a lot of crazy things over the course of making this movie, and singling this out for special comment seems slightly ridiculous to me.  The second entry from his blog can be  urlLink found here  (scroll down to "Noticing Evil"), where he links to  urlLink this piece by David Frum  and  urlLink another by William Safire .  Both of these pieces are interesting, and well worth reading, even if I disagree with their ultimate conclusions.  It is Sullivan's final statement that I take exception to: "Gradually, conservatives are cottoning on to the  real agenda  behind 'The Passion of the Christ.'"  Since both pieces are about the possible anti-Semitic implications of the film, and possible anti-Semitic leanings of Mel Gibson, I feel that this statement is unfounded.  Even if the charge can be leveled that the film is anti-Semitic on some level - a charge which, as I've said before, I do not subscribe to - this does not necessarily mean that this is the "agenda" of the film.  And I do not think it is.  Even Abraham Foxman has stated, most forcefully in the same Diane Sawyer program, that his major concern was not that the film itself was anti-Semitic - a charge that to my knowledge he has not directly leveled - but that it could be seen as anti-Semitic by some and fuel anti-Semitic feelings.  Perhaps this is just a facile distinction.  Except I don't think it is.  The difference between making a blatantly anti-Semitic film and making a film true to what one believes, but that also happens to fuel anti-Semitism, is huge, in my opinion.  And I do not feel that Mel Gibson set out deliberately to make an anti-Semitic film.  Perhaps I am wrong.  It could certainly be said that he has not done enough to allay fears that his film could provoke such a reaction.  But I also feel that with all the controversy for months and months, almost a year or longer it seems, surrounding this film before anyone even saw it means that no one can come into it with an unbiased eye.  And I think that all this controversy has done nothing to help the development of anti-Semitic feelings that have or will happen, and in fact has probably even hurt it in the long run.  It would never have occurred to me before all this mess began to come out of the movie blaming the Jews for anything, much less for the death of Christ.  I was not taught this either by my parents or by my religion - and my religious upbringing was as conservative and evangelical as you are likely to find - and to do so would not only seem strange to me as a person, but in complete opposition to my faith.  Am I unique in this?  Perhaps I am.  I do not profess to know what the average Christian is raised to think or believe.  But I do not think that I am all that unique.  I know that religion is a touchy subject, as is racial bigotry, and emotions tend to get in the way.  But I think if everyone would try to approach this with something less than hysteria and something more like caution, that differences could be worked out.  Or perhaps I am just too optimistic?  Or perhaps unreasonable?  I don't honestly know anymore.  I wish that I could just live with my personal experience of the film, without having to delve into all of these difficult questions that are way beyond my grasp and reach.  But when I read these attacks, I keep thinking that there must be something wrong with me for not seeing anything wrong with the film and indeed for seeing many things right with it.  For me it was a profoundly moving experience for which I am truly grateful.  But I begin to wonder if maybe I should have been sickened or offended by it.  But ultimately, I can only go with what I thought and felt.  And I cannot be swayed away from it by the fact that some crazies have taken things too far (as if they needed an excuse like this) or that even Mel Gibson himself is at fault or culpable in some way for not helping to stem the tide of the controversy.  But I do feel, from seeing the film, that his faith is indeed genuine, and perhaps his reaction is chalked up to defensiveness.  I do not feel that he could have made this film otherwise.  And while the other stuff matters, I'm not sure there's anything Mel Gibson could have done short of altering his vision or not making the film at all.  I leave it to you to decide for yourself whether he chose the right course of action, for I have nothing more to say on the matter, other than to say, while I might not have done it the same way as him, it was not my choice to make.

      I was a little disturbed by Peggy Noonan's  urlLink account of a play audience's reaction  to the news that a character is thinking about having an abortion:   But I must tell you of the small moment that was actually a big moment. (There's a possible spoiler coming up, so if you don't know the story and mean to see the play, stop here.) An important moment in the plot is when a character announces she is pregnant, and considering having an abortion. In fact, she tells her mother-in-law, she's already put $5 down with the local abortionist. It is a dramatic moment. And you know as you watch it that when this play came out in 1960 it was received by the audience as a painful moment--a cry of pain from a woman who's tired of hoping that life will turn out well.   But this is the thing: Our audience didn't know that. They didn't understand it was tragic. They heard the young woman say she was about to end the life of her child, and they applauded. Some of them cheered. It was stunning. The reaction seemed to startle the actors on stage, and shake their concentration. I was startled. I turned to my friend. "We have just witnessed a terrible cultural moment," I said. "Don't I know it," he responded.   Perhaps I'm not the best audience for this because I am pro-life.  But as I've said before, I can understand the pro-choice position, and even respect it.  This is where I am different than so many on both sides who get caught up in the rhetoric.  I understand that it is a difficult issue.  Others refuse to accept that.  So much of the language of the pro-choice movement simply refuses to acknowledge that the choice it is advocating might in fact be a difficult one.  I suspect for most people who choose to have an abortion, it turns out to be one of the most difficult decisions of their lives, and I hardly see the danger in admitting or acknoweldging that.  It would give the arguments for choice a lot more credibility.    But this is not the case.  It is seen in this account Noonan provides.  Cheering for the ability to make the choice may be perfectly valid, but cheering for the choice itself, or even worse, for the agonizing decision making process that a woman has to go through in order to make that choice is simply misguided.  It is not a good thing to have to make that choice.  It means that something is wrong, it means that a woman is ill, or that the baby is ill, or that the family can't afford any more children, or that the woman was raped, or the victim of incest, or that she is only 13 years old.  Most of the times when the woman is presented with the choice (assuming, of course, that abortion is not just another method of birth control), it is a stark and bleak future she faces either way she chooses.  It is not a situation to be taken lightly, to be applauded.  It is a situation to be thought upon, so as to avoid it in the future; it is a situation to be mourned.

      Going to be light (more like non-existent) on the blogging today, as I am in major crisis study mode.  Or rather I should be, so I'm going to act like I am, even if I'm not feeling the pressure just yet.  If today turns out to be a productive day (or something happens that I just can't resist blogging about), then you will see me tomorrow, if not sooner.

      I'm sitting in the library, cracking up while reading  urlLink this article  about a rhino who got a little too friendly with some dude's car.  Toward the end of the story, I really lost it:   A spokeswoman for the park, which says "rhinos are not particularly intelligent animals" on its Web site...   At first I'm laughing, cause I'm thinking, "Uh, duh, that's pretty obvious from the story."  Then, I start thinking about the wording of the sentence.  And I wonder how long it will take the PETA folks to complain about the denigration of the reputation of rhinos.  But perhaps this is just paranoia on my part.  The link is via Alex Neckles' AIM profile.  And I like to give credit where it is due.

      What is it about law students that makes them all insane?  And I don't mean insane in the way that I am insane.  This is the normal insanity brought on by stress beyond all imagining.  This I can understand.  Hell, I can even empathize with it.  There is much ranting going on below this point.  If you are not interested, please stop now.  If you do start reading though, please read to the end, otherwise it wouldn't be fair to the point I am trying to make.  No, I'm talking about that thing about law school that turns people, no matter their age or maturity, into 8th grade girls.  Or perhaps law school just attracts people who are prone to petty and childish gossip.  Either way, it's annoying as all get out.  Everyone talks about everyone else, as if there is nothing else worth discussing in the entire world.  People form cliques that are impossible to penetrate.  And then there is the competition.  A lot of people in law school seems to think they deserve much more than they actually get.  It's always the same with the complaining.  I can understand a healthy dose of complaining - we all suffer from life's disappointments, and things do not always turn out the way we have expected they would, and all of us like to get those things off our chests by moaning about them to our friends, or anyone else who will listen.  But if you are complaining in anything but a joking manner about anything months after the time has passed, then there is a serious problem.  I'm sick of hearing that you should have gotten an A in X's class, you should have gotten the job that Y got, or that you should have made law review.  And while I'm (tangentially) on the subject, I've noticed that everyone in law school seems to be getting really good grades, by the sound of self important tones in people's voices - "I'm doing so well."  Considering there is a curve, this strikes me as darn near impossible.  Very few people are honest about this.  And I'm not saying that if you are pulling straight Cs you should announce it to everyone.  But don't talk like you're making As.  Perhaps people all have different definitions of what doing well is, though, so perhaps I'll let this slide.  Though when you add the haughty tone, it makes it sound different - like not only you are proud of how well you are doing, but that everyone else should be too.  Again, perhaps this is a matter of perspective.    But it isn't even the hardcore competition that you hear about.  Probably because it's St. John's.  But I'd prefer that - at least it is out in the open, so you can be prepared, so you know who to avoid.  It all becomes clear so fast that way.  I've been stabbed by the cutthroat forces only once while I've been here, and that was a complete and total shock to me, and it still isn't even widely known, because the news of it came out of left field to me.  Stop with all the pretending already.  If you want to backstab your way to the top, fine.  I'm told that is often the best way to go, and at the very least, Iif you are willing to sacrifice your self-respect, it is at least as good a way as any other.  But at least try and be semi-honest about it.  I'd certainly respect you a lot more if you cut out all the two-faced crap.  Sorry.  I've been wanting to get that off my chest for a while.  Perhaps this is not the best place to do it, but what the heck.  I'm fed up with the way some of the students act here, sick of the feelings of entitlement that permeate a good portion of the student body.  I'm sick of the way everyone always knows everyone else's business, and more, most people think that they are entitled to know everyone else's business.  That said, most students here are not like this.  Or at least not most of the ones I know well enough to know.  This is an albeit small category of students, but I can imagine and tell that there are other normal, laid back individuals out there, who have the normal law school stresses but aren't complete and total nutcases like the rest of the student body.  For all I know, it may even be a small minority.  But it seems larger, perhaps because it is so vocal, because it constantly needs attention and devotion, because it alerts you to it's presence at every possible moment.

      Please step on over to My Stupid Dog, to find out how  urlLink blogger Timothy Hulsey became a conservative .  A lot of it rings true for me, though, unlike him, I was never a leftist.  I did at one time consider myself to be fairly liberal, though now it is tough to remember that time.  Perhaps one day I will try to articulate here why I stand where I stand today.  Until then, go read the piece above.  I won't even display highlights because I'd want to represent the whole thing, and I think everyone should get it direct from the source.  Plus, I don't want to chop it up - everything should be read in context.

      I find  urlLink this article about the pro-choice protests in D.C. this weekend  interesting.  I want to say at the fore that, while I am against abortion, I understand both sides of the issue and do not mean to denigrate anyone who is pro-choice.  I can even understand advocating strongly for that end, including protests like the ones this weekend.  And as a libertarian, I believe in free speech for all, no matter how much I might disagree.  Still, there are several things that struck me from this article:   Women joined the protest from across the nation and from nearly 60 countries, asserting that damage from Bush's policies is spreading far beyond U.S. shores through measures such as the ban on federal money for family-planning groups that promote or perform abortions abroad.   Abortion is a constitutional right (more on this in a minute), and as such I'm pretty sure it's only guaranteed to American citizens.  Furhtermore, it is the right to have an abortion, not the right to federal funds, that is protected by the right to have an abortion.  Whether the government should fund abortions is a political question, and thus a proper subject of the protest, but I'm not sure that the government deciding not to do so somehow erodes the right.  They are two separate questions.  At least to my mind they are.  The question of keeping the Supreme Court on track to not overturn  Roe v. Wade , or the political pressure against a constitutional amendment banning abortion (neither of which are likely to happen either - more on this below), is different than the issue of whether government funds should go to the promotion, or even the performance, of abortions.   Advocates said abortion rights are being weakened at the margins through federal and state restrictions and will be at risk of reversal at the core if Bush gets a second term.   As far as I see it, only one right is implicated here:  the right to choose to have an abortion.  And I'll make a bold prediction right here:  if the President gets re-elected, nothing will happen to that fundamenal right.  These "erosions" as they are called might occur, so we might get even more complaints about the chipping away of the right.  But the right iself isn't going to go anyway, at least not without a drastic change in the current political climate.  An amendment to the Constitution outlawing abortion is pure fantasy.  It's been tried and has failed every time.  It will never get out of either House, not with the stringent vote requirements there, at least not so long as Congress remains fairly evenly divided along party lines.  But even assuming that such an amendment could get the votes, there's no way it would be ratified by enough states:  too many of them want to provide abortions to their own citizens.  An amendment that proposed to leave it up to the states might get more traction, but would, in the end, be equally unviable and would equally fail.  The best chance is for the Supreme Court to overturn  Roe .  But this is not going to happen either, again not without a major change in public opinion on the issue, or absent a radical change in the Senate membership.  There is no way a Supreme Court nominee who would be willing to overturn  Roe  will ever get confirmed.  And with the vetting of these nominees that goes on (the next confirmation is likely to be a blood-bath), it is unlikely that anyone could succeed in getting through the process using smoke and mirrors.  But assuming the right wing conspiracy really is vast enough to pull off a rather neat and impressive trick, at the very worst, abortion will not be a constitutional issue anymore.  It would not be a fundamental right, but it would not go away.  It might be harder for poor women to get one, because they would have to travel across state lines, or perhaps halfway across the country, but many states will certainly choose to preserve the ability of women to secure abortions.  And over time, more states would probably join the wagon.  In fact, if the Supreme Court hadn't stepped in and decided the issue when it did, it might have already happened that most states would have come to allow them by now.  Certainly the pro-life movement wouldn't have been as mobilized and as powerful and as centralized as it is today.  Which brings me to Hillary:   Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York, referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, said the administration is "filled with people who ... consider Roe v. Wade the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history."   I won't dwell on this point, but it is possible to think that  Roe  was badly decided without necessarily being pro-life.  And if you don't believe me,  urlLink just ask Alan Dershowitz .  If you scroll to the bottom of that link, a summary of his argument that sounds a lot like my own:   On areas where the public is divided on “moral vision,” Dershowitz (generally viewed as a liberal) takes the conservative position that the people should continue fighting out these issues in the legislatures.  The abortion debate, for example, hinges upon one’s definition of when human life begins, and this cannot be changed by experience (any more than can, say, the Axiom of Choice).  Dershowitz argues that Roe v. Wade (1973) would eventually energize the socially conservative movement (the “moral majority”) of the 1980s, while the “progressive” side on the part of female reproductive choice remained lazy as to fund-raising and political activism, depending on the courts.  (Dershowitz feels that a purely political battle would have otherwise settled for pro-choice.)   But as if all that isn't enough, I'll leave you with this rather bizarre quote from the first article I mentioned.  I make no comment on it because I think it speaks for itself:   And feminist Gloria Steinem accused Bush of squandering international good will and taking positions so socially conservative that he seems - according to Steinem - to be in league with the likes of Muslim extremists or the Vatican.   There's much more to say about this issue.  But I should be studying.  Perhaps I'll parse the rest of the article later for more things to say.

      There are a lot of things that peeve me about the students here at St. John's.  I guess this means that I am really peeved at humanity, because I do not think the students here are any different than people generally.  Well, at least not in certain respects.  Not the ones that bother me the most.  It's just that I have little exposure to people in general (though when I do, I often complain about them as well - let's face it, I just complain about everything that bothers me, and a lot of things bother me) but I do have great exposure to the fine, if somewhat annoying, populace here at St. John's, so complain away about them I will often do.  Like right now.  Why, oh why, is it necessary to use a credit card to buy only a soda, worth a grand total of about a $1?  I know a lot of people here do this in the cafeteria all the time, some of them are friends of mine.  I could understand it before, when the nearest ATM was not in the building, with the tight schedules we law students keep.  But now there is one right next to the cafeteria.  Why not just get $20 or $40 out and make that your cafeteria money for the week?  Would that be so hard?  Some people say that they just never use cash.  I can understand this.  But there are other options.  The university offers a debit system, so that you can put money on your ID and just have them swipe the card every time you buy something.  This is the fastest and most strongly advocated method.  And you get the added benefit of not being charged sales tax, which here in NYC is no joke.    But it's just a suggestion.  As you were.

      I know I mention lots of quizzes here, but this one is very different and very worth the while.  It's absolutely hilarious.  It's a satire of all those political quizzes you see out there that are supposed to tell your affiliation should be.  This one turns it all on its head.  Probably most fun for those who already have a sense of their own orientation and want to have a good laugh at their own expense.  So if you have trouble laughing at yourself, then proceed with caution to the  urlLink Satirical Political Beliefs Assessment Test .  There are four categories of response to each question:  CONS (Archconservative); LIBL (Leftwing Wacko); LBRT (Antigovernment Libertine); COMM (Commie Sympathizer).  Here's a sample of what you will find:   Robin Hood's practice of stealing from the rich to give to the poor was...  CONS: a crime. LIBL: a brave, generous and heroic deed. LBRT: a foolish, misguided attempt at social engineering.  COMM: an inspiration to us all.    And then:   How do you feel about nude sunbathing?   CONS: Never tried it.  Never will. LIBL: Did it a lot in my college days. LBRT: Do it so often, I no longer need sunscreen. COMM: It repulses me.  You see, for some mysterious reason, God made naked communists rather unsightly.   Check out the whole thing.  There are lots of questions for lots of laughs.

      I found  urlLink this while perusing Google News .  It's a short review of Quentin Tarantino's  Kill Bill :   Kill Bill is just another run of the mill revenge tale dressed up with lots of martial arts action and blood. The Bride (Uma Thurman) is the one out for revenge.  On her wedding day, her husband-to-be was killed, she was beaten up and her unborn child was stolen from her womb.   After waking from a four-year coma she sets out to even the score with the five people responsible: Bill (David Carradine), Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), Copperhead (Vivica A Fox), Side Winder (Michael Madsen) and California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah).   What follows is a fairly typical Quentin Tarantino bloodbath. By the end of it all you’re left is numb and bored.    It's nice to know not everyone in the world is enamored with Tarantino's style.  I have never really been able to get into his movies.  I admit he has a certain style, and is certainly very consistent in sticking to it, but I categorize him with Oliver Stone - both of them make very competent, but somewhat hackish and brutish films.  I guess I just prefer more subtle work, and while this is not a universal proposition, there is something about those two directors' particular unsubtlety - perhaps the fact that is is beyond unsubtle and is instead like being assaulted - that I do not care for.  That said, I haven't seen  Kill Bill , either volume, so I say nothing specific about the merits of that particular film.  Perhaps someday I can bring myself to watch it.

      Take the quiz below to find out where you fit in in Dante's Hell.  Here are my rather auspicious results:   The Dante's Inferno Test has sent you to  Purgatory!

Through contrition, confession, and satisfaction by works of righteousness, you must make your way up the mountain. As the sins are cleansed from your soul, you will be illuminated by the Sun of Divine Grace, and you will join other souls, smiling and happy, upon the summit of this mountain. Before long you will know the joys of Paradise as you ascend to the ethereal realm of Heaven.   Not suffering damnation is generally a good thing.  However, I am slightly disturbed by my high score for Level 8.  It  urlLink doesn't sound like a very fun place .  I'll have to do my best to avoid it.

      Okay, so for the good.  My iPod came today.  And I'm already deeply attached to it.  Can't wait to try it out on the mean streets tomorrow.    But this hardly makes up for the bad.  I missed out on a fun trip for dumplings in Chinatown and a fun movie viewing experience because of my stupid procrastination.  The final draft of my directed research paper is due tomorrow (well, technically, today as it is already after midnight), and of course, I put off working on it so I had to spend the whole day working on it.  It's a cautionary tale, but I'm quite sure if I haven't gotten the lesson by now, it isn't going to come.  Now for the random mutterings.  I've been thinking about Jerry Orbach's exit from "Law & Order" this season, and how the show could send him off with a little fun, and while listening to the CD of  The Fantasticks  today, it came to me.  And I'm requesting in advance that you not be offended by what I'm about to type, because if you haven't seen the show or are not familar with the music, then what I'm about to say might be a little strange.  Jerry Orbach was in the orignal cast, and he plays this unsavory sort of character who at one point is hired by two of the characters to abduct someone.  As they plan the crime, Orbach's character says that "the proper word is rape."  He then starts to sing, a long and loud recitation of the word "rape."  It isn't funny in the abstract, of course, by in context, it is humorous, though I suppose you'll just have to take my word for it.  Or go out and buy the CD.  Anyway, so I thought it would be (funny?  no, perhaps just interesting) if the detectives on "Law & Order" were investigating a little rape/murder (now I smell a cross-over with SVU...mmmm), and instead of the usual quip before the commercial break, he could do a rendition of the beginning of the song:  "Ra-a-a-pe."  But perhaps this is too sick.  No one would get it, and they'd all be offended.  Definitely few would get it.  It would be like that time that I was watching "Boy Meets World," and Mr. Feeney (played by William Daniels) cracked a quip about  The Graduate  (which William Daniels was in) being a great film.  But I digress...Ah, yes, I was just dragging myself back to work, after alienating half my readership (read:  2 of you) by cracking jokes about rape.

      Something about this has been bothering me for a while, since I was not brought up Catholic (or any other religious belief that pays homage to this theory), so I never really knew what was meant by Immaculate Conception.  Then, I was pretty sure that I read somewhere it referred to fact that in Catholic doctrine Mary was born without the stain of original sin.  But bringing this up with some Catholic friends at school led to some confusion.  So today, long after the initial discussions, I decided to put off work and go on a little quest for the information.  A quick Google search led to the  urlLink following information discovery :   It’s important to understand what the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is and what it is not. Some people think the term refers to Christ’s conception in Mary’s womb without the intervention of a human father; but that is the Virgin Birth. Others think the Immaculate Conception means Mary was conceived "by the power of the Holy Spirit," in the way Jesus was, but that, too, is incorrect. The Immaculate Conception means that Mary, whose conception was brought about the normal way, was conceived without original sin or its stain—that’s what "immaculate" means: without stain. The essence of original sin consists in the deprivation of sanctifying grace, and its stain is a corrupt nature. Mary was preserved from these defects by God’s grace; from the first instant of her existence she was in the state of sanctifying grace and was free from the corrupt nature original sin brings.   So this solves the mystery.  And it is nice to know that I was not going insane, that I did not imagine I read something that I did not.  This got me thinking about other things that Catholics believe, more specifically the doctrine of It’s important to understand what the  urlLink doctrine of transubstantiation :   Transubstantiation means more than the Real Presence. According to transubstantiation, the bread and wine are actually transformed into the actual body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ, with only the appearances of bread and wine remaining. This is why, at the Last Supper, Jesus held what appeared to be bread and wine, yet said: "This is my body. . . . This is my blood" (Mark 14:22-24, cf. Luke 22:14-20). If Christ were merely present along side bread and wine, he would have said "This contains my body. . . . This contains my blood," which he did not say.   This has been explained to me many times by my good friend Christina, who is not Roman Catholic but is more wise about these matters than myself (really, she's more wise about everything, but I don't like to dwell on that), and I can never quite remember exactly how it goes, so for good measure I looked it up as well.  So thanks for taking this trip with me down the road of Catholic dogma.  It's been fun.  Assuming you kept reading this far, that is.   UPDATE :  Since the original source of my consernation was a correction I read in the New York Times, this evening my curiousity got the better of me and I went to look it up.  I found the  urlLink original correction I had read :   A Critic's Notebook article in Weekend yesterday about religious films that have stirred contention included an erroneous reference to the Immaculate Conception in connection with Jean-Luc Godard's 1985 film ''Hail Mary.'' Christian doctrine teaches that Mary was conceived by her mother, Anne, without the stain of original sin; the term does not refer to the conception of Jesus by Mary.    But then I found this, a  urlLink correction to the correction :   A Critic's Notebook article in Weekend on Friday about religious films that have stirred contention included an erroneous reference to the Immaculate Conception in connection with Jean-Luc Godard's 1985 film ''Hail Mary,'' and a correction in this space on Saturday misattributed the belief involved. It is Roman Catholic teaching -- not the teaching of all Christian denominations -- that Mary was conceived by her mother, Anne, without the stain of original sin. And the term does not refer to the conception of Jesus by Mary.   I found this to be amusing.  Not surprising.  But very amusing.  So I thought I'd add it on the the fun.

      Okay, so I get home from a fabulous evening of theater (more on this later), and I rewind the tape that is supposed to contain the new, hours old episode of 24.  But when I hit play, I have the image of the show, but the sound of whatever the tape previously contained.  So I cannot watch my show.  Or I suppose more accurately, I cannot listen to my show, though I can watch all the images and try to read lips.  But that doesn't sound like very much fun.  So now I'm in crisis mode, because I'm going to miss the new episode of The West Wing that is on tomorrow night.  I already missed the return of Tim Matheson, and now this.  I cannot take any more TV setbacks.  TV is my old standby.  This whole night class thing really sucks.  Okay, I'll stop feeling sorry for myself now.  I promise.

      Today has just been an awful day.    It was a moment like you only see in the movies.  Do you ever have those?  I had one today.  This one was like those scenes in the movies where you accidentally overhear a conversation that just changes everything for you, or puts all the pegs into place for you, and is rather unwelcome or uninviting information that you have been wanting to know for months, but only if it came out the other way, and now that it hasn't, you wish you could forget it and go back to living in blissful ignorance.  And then, just when you think the situation cannot get any worse, someone else blunders into the picture, someone connected to the situation, but who doesn't realize that you, too, are connected, and of all the people present, you are the only person who truly understands the whole of the situation and how horribly disappointing it is for you, but since no one else present could possibly understand that (you could explain it, but it would only make you sound pathetic or insane), you must carry on a mundane conversation as if nothing is out of the ordinary.  And even that conversation manages to be about how much your life sucks, anyway, but for a completely different reason.  Not that I expected the whole affair to turn out any differently.  I just didn't expect it to happen in so trite and formulaic a way.  My life is sometimes like a movie, but it's usually more like one directed by David Lynch:  kind of weird and makes no sense.  But at least this whole thing is finally over.  And hopefully, I can put it easily behind me, not dwell too much on it, and move on.  I realize that reading this, many of you will not have a clue what I am talking about.  And that's fine.  That's as it should be.  Being too specific will only lead to trouble.  It's something that I have to deal with on my own.  But it's nice to have had this space to work out my thoughts.  And since I've written them, I'm of course going to post them, as a public reminder to myself of all the time I've wasted on silly fantasies.  I've been brought back down to Earth today, and been given a healthy dose of reality, and now it is time to move on, and let the real work commence.  Onward and upward, as they say.

      Tom Devine, an American blogger living in Switzerland (to be read daily at  urlLink The Bluebook Authority ),  urlLink sums up rather nicely  the level of frustration I have been feeling of late with the whole 9/11-could-have-been-prevented talk:   Of course people have thought about the possibility of hijacked jetliners being used by terrorists as weapons, that's what scenario planners do, they think of what could happen and how it can be prevented.  There are volumes and volumes of scenario's sitting around somewhere that have every imaginable Trojan Horse plot. The question is, how much of that could have really been acted upon?  Can you imagine the reaction if the President said on August 5, 2000, " we have reason to believe that terrorists will use commercial aircraft as terrorist weapons. We don't when, where, or which airline, but we wanted you all to know this concern ."  Ok, thanks for that.   I was just having this conversation yesterday with the lovely ladies of my study group.  To me, as I've said before, I find it perfectly legitimate to look into what was known.  It would have been great to have prevented 9/11, and the more we look into intelligence failures and communications problems then the greater chance we have of fixing the problem and preventing it from happening again.  But so far, I have seen no evidence that it could have been prevented at all.  Nothing close to it.  There seems to be nothing more than a vague, uncollected and unconnected series of facts and theories and opinions and hypotheticals that say very little about specific plans at specific times and specific places.  Instituting general warnings on the basis of what was available would have been foolhardy, as Mr. Devine persuasively points out.  And even if there was enough information available to prevent it from happening, all that information was not put together, and had it been, it would probably have been too late at that stage to do anything about it.    This is all symptomatic of what I like to call the Hindsight Syndrome.  We all think we know best, and we all see how obvious it was something was going to occur after it has already happened.  But I tend not to buy into this. At the end of the day, even if everything was done right, something could still have gone wrong.  There are any number of variables that go into each single daily occurrence, and there is no way to know even what all of them are, not even after the fact.  Is intelligence a problem we should be working on?  Yes, of course.  I'd rather not get blown up on the subway at any moment, and most people I'm sure feel the same way.  Does this mean I think the political blame game currently going on is appropriate?  No, I don't.  I think it's foolish and unnecessary to engage in such discussions and debates.  Planning for the future is more important than dwelling on the past anyway.  These distractions are endless and unhelpful.  And while I am on the subject, I am equally appalled at the attempts by those on the right to foist blame upon the Clinton administration.    But I know better than to ask for more, especially in an election year.

      My Stupid Dog blogger Timothy Hulsey has written a  urlLink superb review of  The Alamo  .  Rarely do I read reviews of movies I haven't seen.  Even less rarely do I read reviews of movies I have no desire to see.  And before reading this, I must admit I had no burning plans to rush out and see this film.  I felt largely ambivalent about it, despite my love of Westerns, and this was driven by something Mr. Hulsey describes in his review:   Meanwhile, Republican red-staters hear the filmmakers' statements about "historical accuracy," and grit their teeth: The left-wing revisionists are at it again. Allen Barra, writing for the online magazine Salon, expresses the hope that today's historical epics can take pesky pro-American sentiment down a peg: "The dark side of these cowboy heroes depicted in ... 'The Alamo' are [sic] just what America needs to see today." Conservatives hear those words and cringe: They know that a financially successful film which venerates General Santa Anna and execrates the historical Texians could ruin a vital American myth for an entire generation. Of course, a film that abandons history for mindless action violence would prove no less destructive to America's self-esteem.   I like the Western myths.  They are something uniquely American, and they make great movies. And while I am not saying that the myths should remain unquestioned and continue blaring on through all eternity as gospel truth, I do think that they have their place, and should be treated at least with something bordering on critical respect.  To get an idea of what I mean, rent  The Searchers  and Once  Upon a Time in the West .  There you will see nostalgia mixed in with the gritty reality, almost a sad and reluctant letting go of the myths of the West.  But Hulsey, a self proclaimed conservative himself, provides ample justification for seeing the film, and calms my fears about that a little:     Fortunately, we conservatives have every reason to rejoice at The Alamo. Unlike Disney's bewildered marketing department, this film knows precisely what it is and what it intends to do. Not for a single moment does it deviate from its course or pander to its audience. There are two brief, intense battle sequences -- one at the Alamo, one at San Jacinto -- in which the gore is almost entirely suggested. But for the most part, this particular epic is concerned with discussions, not concussions. We learn why the people of Texas went to war with Mexico, and their reasons should hearten today's conservatives: The Texians wish to force a sudden regime change on General Santa Anna, who has replaced Mexico's constitutional republic with a despotic tyranny. (Does this conflict sound at all familiar?)   In fact, his entire description of the film makes it sound just like those Westerns that I have come to know and love.  It does not seem to buy into an easy view of the situation from either perspective, not painting anyone in a particularly flattering light, and yet, at the same time, clearly coming down on the right side of the events.  Everyone should trek on over the his blog and read the entire review.  His reviews are always worth reading, and this one, unlike most I've ever read, actually leaves me wanting to see the movie.  Well, that and the presence of Dennis Quaid doesn't do much to hurt, either.  So perhaps I will be carving some time out of my hectic exam preparation schedule to go and see this film.  And when I do, I think I will not be disappointed.

      I'm sitting here in the library, bored, and as I think that, I ponder what exactly I mean by it for a second.  For there are varieties of boredom, two of which my brain has the capacity to comprehend at the moment.  At the moment I am bored not because of lack of things to do.  In fact, I have a rather large pile of things sitting here to occupy myself with, and even more at home (well, at my apartment - lately, I am having much trouble referring to it as home, but that is a subject for another day, perhaps).  Perhaps it is because all of it is so overwhelming that I am bored with it, bored with the monotony of constantly shifting from one thing to another, with no break, with no variation in the type of work presented to me.  One begins to come up with variations, however slight, in order to make the task less objectionable.  I begin to, for example, decide which one of my fascinating law school subjects that I prefer to the others, even though in the end the work is the same, reading and outlining, reading and outlining.  But most of all I am just bored with the experience of it all.  Never in my life have I been a particularly hard worker.  I just sort of meandered through school, making fairly respectable grades (though nothing stellar) and that has been OK for me.  I wanted law school to be different, and I knew that I would have to work hard, and at first, that was certainly not boring.  It gave me a sense of purpose, fear drove me to expand my powers of preparation for class and for exams.    But now things are different.  I have not failed.  I have flourished, for the most part, with a few bumps along the way, again in the same way I always have, not stellar, but nothing to sneeze at.  And I started to get a little complacent, and a little lazy too.  So now I am just bored with the experience of it all.  Bored of the reading, bored with going to class - and this is even in the classes that interest me.  And as this is only my second year, I suspect this feeling will only get worse next year.  Every semester I say that the one coming up is going to be different, and that I am really going to apply myself and make out a strict schedule and stick to it.  And every semester I end up spending lots of time watching cable and surfing the net.  And while this gives me occasional pause and makes me feel like a lazy bum, I usually quickly get over it, at least enough so that it doesn't prevent me from continuing on what some might call a self-destructive track.  I get bored with feeling that way, too, so I throw it off and think of something else.

      Every once in a while, I am intrigued enough by the title of one of the blogs on Blogger's recently updated list that I click on it.  This time I was not disappointed as I found  urlLink Do I dare? , a great journal type blog.  Those who know me well can probably guess what it is about this particular title that would pull me in.  For those who do not, I will allow myself a slight digression, to quote from  urlLink my favorite poet :   And indeed there will be time   To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”    And then:   Do I dare          Disturb the universe?   In a minute there is time   For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.    And the part that immediately came to mind:   Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?   I do not know if this was the blogger's intended reference, but I suspect that it was.  And I submit the following  urlLink portion of a post from her blog  as evidence in support of my conclusion (scroll all the way to the bottom):   What life have you if you have not life together? There is no life that is not in community, And no community not lived in praise of GOD. Even the anchorite who meditates alone, For whom the days and nights repeat the praise of GOD, Prays for the Church, the Body of Christ incarnate. And mow you live dispersed on ribbon roads, And no man knows or cares who is his neighbour Unless his neighbour makes too much disturbance, But all dash to and fro in motor cars, Familiar with the roads and settled nowhere. Nor does the family even move about together, But every son would have his motor cycle, And daughters ride away on casual pillions.  TS Eliot.

      Here's the first line of a  urlLink story from Reuters :   Democratic White House challenger John Kerry has accused President George W. Bush of manipulating fears about security and terror for political gain.   The article goes on to quote Kerry directly:   "Home base for George Bush, as we saw to the nth degree in the press conference, is terror. Ask him a question, he's going to terror," Kerry said, referring to Bush's prime-time news conference on Tuesday.   In all fairness, I must post the Bush administration's response, also quoted in the article:   Bush campaign spokesman Steve Schmidt called Kerry's comments "outrageous," saying, "They are the latest example of him playing politics with the most serious issue of our time: winning the war on terror."   I've said it here before, though perhaps a little disdainfully, and that is that EVERYTHING IS POLITICS.  Perhaps it is not for the best, but that is the way it is, and one cannot expect either Bush or Kerry to change the rules at this point in the game.  And as this is an issue, i.e. the war on terror, that I do hope people will be driven to vote on, then why shouldn't it be part of the political discussions we have in electing our leaders.  In other words, why shouldn't either candidate use this issue to get elected, since it is, in my opinion, the most important issue out there?    My main beef here, though, is with Kerry's suggestion that Bush is trying to make everything about terror.  Well, get a clue, because it is all about terror.  If the problem of terrorism isn't addressed now and eventually resolved (though I suspect the war will continue long after Bush's second term expires, assuming he is re-elected), then the rest of it really doesn't matter.  It is this lack of understanding that upsets me most about Kerry.  And this is the main reason I cannot support him in his run for President.

      Reading  urlLink this article in the New York Times today , I was struck, but not surprised, by what I read:   The prime minister, in a phrase that surely must have sounded good to Mr. Bush, said their two nations were committed to eradicating "not just terrorism, but the breeding grounds of terrorism."  Mr. Bush has argued that the campaign in Iraq is that kind of campaign, and some administration officials, notably Vice President Dick Cheney, have suggested that there were at least contacts between Saddam Hussein or his minions and the terror network of Al Qaeda. Others have been more circumspect. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in January that no concrete evidence had been found of a link between the Hussein regime and Al Qaeda.  But there is nonetheless wide agreement now that post-Hussein Iraq has become a magnet for anti-American militants of all stripes who are opposed to the American occupation there.   I think this passage, particularly the last sentence, largely misses the point, which is perhaps not all that surprising for the New York Times.  It shouldn't matter, ultimately, whether the current violence in Iraq is the result of forces that were already there or a result of the war on terror reaching into its borders.  This is purely an academic question, and should thus be left to the vagaries of academia.  Our focus, and the focus of the leaders of the worldwide war on terror, should be on understanding the cause only so far as it helps dealing with the problem in the present or in planning for the future.  It is the same with all the 9/11 Commission nonsense.    In other news, the Utah Jazz will be missing the playoffs for the first time in a whole bunch of years.  Sorry, but I'm too lazy to look up the actual stats.  But, some say, and I'd be inclined to agree (though I'm slightly biased as they are my team), that Jerry Sloan should get Coach of the Year.  I have not followed the NBA as much in the past couple of years as I used to (I don't follow anything as much as I used to - I am in law school after all), and the retirement of my very favorite player, John Stockton, and the departure of Karl Malone, did very little to alter that trend this season.  But the fact that the Jazz could come even remotely close to making the playoffs say something about Sloan's abilities.   urlLink David Aldridge says it best :   Losing two Hall of Famers is, um, tough. So is losing one's leading scorer 31 games into the season. Of course, Sloan never allows excuses to enter the state of Utah, so he said he'd coach what he had left. And so he put his Arroyos and Lopezes and Giriceks and Pavlovics on the floor, and the Jazz just kept on winning. To say this is Sloan's best coaching job is redundant; every season since he took over in Salt Lake City has been like this. His team gets the absolute maximum out of its ability, and if it loses, there's no whining about the officiating or lamenting things not done. One of my remaining goals in this business is to get to see a Utah practice from start to finish. I just wonder how Sloan does it.   He will probably not win, of course.  The NBA is all about flash and egos, and that has never been the style of Sloan or the Jazz.  He quietly gets the job done, and I think that's something to be respected and admired, so I thought I'd make mention of it here.    Oh, and, if I'm not mistaken, Sloan's never won Coach of the Year.  Again, I'm too lazy to look it up.  But I'm nearly certain that I'm right.  Assuming I am correct, it's all the proof that is needed that he won't win this year.  If he hasn't gotten it in years past, then he certainly isn't going to get it now, when the team isn't even in the playoffs.  And that's a shame.

      So I'm back at the grind today.  I spent the weekend when I wasn't busy talking to my family or hanging out with them, or doing nothing, taking that oh-so-often trip down the road of regret.  What would have happened if I'd only [fill in the blank].  Lately I've been beating myself up over staying in New York, because every time I go home I realize how much I miss my family and my home and I don't want to come back.  But come back I do, because I must, because I made a rather silly decision to come here in the first place and a rather hasty decision to remain here when I had other options.  Now I'm stuck with my choices.  And I regret that I made them, as those of us who are prone to self-doubt often do.  But then I start to think what would life be like if I'd never moved here to begin with.  I certainly wouldn't realize that home is where I want to be if I'd never left it.  And I wouldn't have met someone I consider to be my very best friend.  And if I hadn't stayed here, I wouldn't have met all the wonderful people I've met in law school, or gotten to better know a previous acquaintance, a person who I cherish now for her kindness and friendship and support.  So all in all I'd say that there is, at least, a silver lining.  And considering that all of these experiences have largely made me who I am today, and that I like that person, even though she's hard to find sometimes, I think that I have made the right decisions.  Except that now, should I choose to move somewhere closer to home, it could prove very difficult for me, since most people who graduate from this law school stay relatively close to this area, and certainly very few end up working in the South.  At the same time I feel I must go home.  I am feeling drawn toward there.  My sister is going to be getting married relatively soon (perhaps in a little over a year), and will probably be starting a family not too long after that, and I would like to be close enough so that I can be a presence in my sister's children's lives.  I want them to know me and love me; I want to be the cool aunt who gets to have fun with them and then send them home to their mother when they start to get on my nerves.  I do not want to see them only once or twice a year.  I also feel a great sense of peace whenever I go home, no matter how much stress I may be otherwise under, something I never feel up here even when I have no stress at all.  And I long for that feeling to return.  I just fit so much better there, something I never would have known had I not left.  But returning will not be easy.  It will probably not be easy to find a job.  But I have to do it and so it will get done.  I trust that if it is where I am supposed to be, and I really feel that it is, that all will work out for the best in the end.  So on I toil.  I promise more lively and interesting and un-personal posts will follow in the coming days.  As well as complaints about studying for exams I am sure.

      Sorry for my rather unceremonious disappearance.  I went home for Easter Break, and the internet situation is a little spotty there (trying to get my Dad to go wireless - perhaps I'll make it a Father's Day gift, as my father loves messing with things like that), plus I was feeling too lazy to blog.  It was a thoroughly unproductive week, if one looks to the traditional indicia.  But I did get to relax and visit with my family and go to my parent's church on both Good Friday and Easter Sunday, so all was not lost.  It was a very enjoyable visit.  Now the pressure sets in, now that I am back in New York and cannot ignore the work looming on the horizon.    That's about it for now.  Have lots more to say, but I'm really quite tired.  So off I will go to shower and then to bed.

      I was struck by something this morning watching Dr. Rice's testimony before the 9/11 Commission.  All the talk has been, and the supposed purpose of the Commission is, to asses the response to the threat of 9/11 in order to preven it from happening again.  But watching this morning, I was struck by the animosity some of those from some of the Commissioners toward Dr. Rice, particularly in those "questions" from former Senator Bob Kerrey.  Now, I've always liked and respected Mr. Kerrey.  But he seemed to take this opportunity to learn more and use it to score political points, first urging Dr. Rice to use her influence within the administration to signal some change in the current actions of the U.S. in Iraq.  This is something so blatantly without the scope of the Commission that even Kerrey's preface that he would not get another opportunity to speak with her about his feelings was not enough.  It makes one wonder what the tone of the secret meetings of the commisssion have been like, without cameras for everyone to play to.    I felt Dr. Rice held her own pretty well.  She was forceful and firm when needed, without ever being rude, even when subject to what I would characterize as rudeness from members of the Commission.  I'm not sure the testimony really cleared anything up though.  I'm not sure it was all that productive.  Perhaps I will glance over the transcript later and see if I can glean something from it.  The whole point seems academic anyway, since 9/11 did happen, and while I think the goal of preventing future attacks is a worthy one, the Commission seems to be putting itself more to the uses of attacking what wasn't done, rather than trying to use it as a learning experience.  But I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  If you put a bunch of lawyers and politicians in a room with cameras, and a lot of buzz assuring a major audience, they are going to resort to things like this.  Everything is political after all, especially in an election year.  Silly of me to expect something different when the topic is as serious as this.

      From  urlLink Andrew Sullivan, under the heading of "Poseur Alert" :   "The value of listening to Brion's score by itself - with the exception of his thematically tongue-in-cheek "Strings That Tie to You" - is situated in the potency of its corresponding visual nostalgia. This seems to be the logical fate of most film scores, but in the case of Eternal Sunshine, Brion's insistence on certain themes popping in and out of his textures seems particularly appropriate, as the soundtrack's fluid matrix performatizes the cinematography's mind/body collapse: In the film, Brion's organi-synthgaze postlude "Phone Calls" plays after Joel decides not to try and save his first memory of Clementine, but just to enjoy it. Here, Brion's score meets Eternal Sunshine's oculophilia halfway, and fittingly comprises one of the film's most potent scenes." -  urlLink Nick Sylvester , Pitchforkmedia.   I may not know a lot about music, but these things should be understandable to persons of moderate intelligence, of which I believe I am one.  And this makes no sense to me whatsoever.    This is a nice segue, since I did see  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .  I thought it was good, but not great.  I think there were certain problems with the plot that I will not go into here because I would not want to spoil the story for anyone who might want to see it.  But there were things in the plot that were secondary, and seemed tacked on only to advance the main plot.  And things like that annoy me, because secondary characters and plots are ususally my favorite parts of movies, and when they are independent, yet integrated, then I tend to get annoyed.  Perhaps those of you who have seen it will understand what I am talking about, without my being more specific.  Otherwise, I would recommend it.  It's unlike most things out there, and is very engrossing, while being distancing at the same time.  Of course, I haven't seen anything else out there at the moment, so I don't have a lot to compare it to.

      I had to post  urlLink this item from yesterday's Best of the Web :   President Bush got some support from an unlikely source yesterday. CNN reports that Sen. Ted Kennedy declared in a speech at the Brookings Institution: "Iraq is George Bush's Vietnam." John Kerry, Bush's foe and Kennedy's junior colleague, has made Vietnam, where by the way he served, the centerpiece of his campaign. It's interesting to find Kennedy of all people arguing that Bush's own record of service matches Kerry's.  Not that Kennedy's speech was entirely favorable to the president. Indeed, much of it was an anti-Bush rant. "In this administration," he said, "truth is the first casualty of policy," whatever that means. The  urlLink Associated Press  reports that Kennedy said, "This president has now created the largest credibility gap since Richard Nixon." And: "He has broken the basic bond of trust with the American people."  Mary Jo Kopechne could not be reached for comment.   I hope Kennedy keeps shouting his mouth off, because this could become a recurring bit in Best of the WEb, much like when it reports some story involving Arafat's continued support of terrorism with this statement:  "Arafat won a Nobel Peace Price in 1994."

      Sorry my blog self has been a little non-existent, but once again the second year of law school is threatening to overwhelm me.  So I've been a little busy.  Since blogging provides too much of a distraction to me, I have been leaving my computer at home and spending lots of time at school in an effort to up my productivity.  It has not necessarily helped so much, but I will be getting a much needed break this week, no school from tomorrow through Monday.  Well, at least there are no classes, but I will still be deeply absorbed in the worlds of Business Organizations and Evidence, not to mention a glance over or two of my paper, most likely on the plane ride home tomorrow.  It has been a bad week.  I have been dealing with a lot of difficult and unecessary anger.  I think I am finally starting to get past it, but every time I think that, it resounds upon me once again.  I am hoping that going home, and seeing my family again, will help make it more bearable.  At least this is my hope.  I think I just need to get away from New York, and law school, and everything else in my life up here.  Of course, there are unique challenges awaiting me there, such as seeing my sister for the first time after our unpleasantness of Sunday.  Plus there will be many distractions that I will have to do my best to avoid if I am to make it a relaxing, yet productive visit.    So, all of this is to say that you, my faithful readers, may be seeing precious little of me over the next few days.  I will do my best to stay in touch, and update you all on my progress back to normalcy.  It's really time to dig in now, and I know I will be able to, if I can just let go of a few things, and since I have to, I know I'll be able to.  I hope everyone who is celebrating something this week enjoys their festivities and their reflections on the meaning of the season are worthwhile.  If not, I hope you at least get some holiday time to relax and recoup.  Take care, and I'll see you on the other side, if not sooner.

      Okay, no more harboring ill feelings, no more letting the anger and the frustration overwhelm me.  I have been like a yo-yo all day, I know, and I truly hate days like this, but I think that this time, I've seen the light.  First, I had a most wonderful and calming conversation with my good friend Christina, who listened attentively as I expunged the day's difficulties upon her.  She was most supportive, as she always is, and I came away feeling renewed and refreshed, though little bumps along the way threatened my serenity.  Then, a thoughtful and supportive instant message from Simone picked me right back up again.  She and I shared the benefit of good conversation and company this weekend, and now I realize that God was really looking out for me in that department, preparing me for the misery (or so it seems) ahead.  I am grateful for being able to get to know her better over the past few months, and I choose to focus on that rather than the nasty business at hand.  Then came the real kick in the knees that I needed.  I mentioned earlier that I unintentionally inspired my roommate to get out and go to Palm Sunday mass tonight.  She didn't come back immediately afterwards, and I wondered what she was up to.  She just came back in, having been spiritually renewed and inspired by the beginning of the holy week to go and see  The Passion .  It was as profoundly moving an experience for her as it was for me.  But that is not what got me.  Nice as it is that I was able to indirectly benefit someone spiritually, what she said back to me was most beneficial of all.  She told me that she forced herself to watch every bit of Christ's suffering, because if he could go through all that, then the least she could do is watch.   And it all clicked.  What is it that I'm really upset about?  It is a trifiing matter that will be unimportant to me in a matter of days.  Surely if Christ could bear the weight of the torture and the weight of all sin, then I can bear the discomfort of not having a perfect life, of meeting with disappointment and despair.  No, I am not God, and He knows that, and does not expect me to be as strong as His Son.  But surely He can expect me to not go to pieces over a simple and ultimately unimportant matter.  And more surely than that, I can and will deliver.  Though I may stumble along the way, I have ever intention of success.  And so, as Scarlett O'Hara says:  "Tomorrow is another day."  I get to start fresh, and make light of today's irksome difficulties.  And they will be ground to dust.

      Okay, folks, it's just going to be one of those days.  Feeling very angry at the moment, like I was led on and betrayed and stomped on.  Wish I could say more.  But I'm too angry, and it's too personal to talk about at the moment.  But I will overcome this.  I complained to a gracious friend, I'm refusing to do work for the rest of the night - instead, I'm watching The Chamber of Secrets on HBO.  Then more TV, and then bed.  I think I might eat some ice cream and stuff, and then clean my room up.  That always makes me feel better, and keeps my mind off of things.  I know how to ward off the evil, bad thoughts.  So if you'll excuse me...

      Well, it's the little things in life.  Here I am, feeling down about my sister and being unproductive and lazy and I just happen to mention in passing that I went to church this morning, and how it is Palm Sunday and all, and I just inspired my roommate to go to an evening service.  She even thanked me for doing so.  And that feels really good, praise be to God.

      It's amazing how a day can go from sublime to foreboding in a matter of seconds.  I got up early (for me) this lovely Sunday morning, remembering to set my clock forward, to attend church with Christina and Simone.  It was a very lovely Palm Sunday experience in the beautiful Greek Orthodox Cathedral on 74th Street.  I even got a lovely palm to take home with me as a reminder of the day.  Isn't it amazing how I can't find more to say about such a pleasant experience, when I am getting ready to say so much about an unpleasant one?  So, my sister called me last night (actually early this morning) when I was in bed and left a message telling me that she had some "news" that she wanted to share with me.  Now I love my sister - she's my twin, and as we've gotten older I've come to think of her as one of my best friends - and she is so nice and sweet and kind and really lovely in so many ways, and a much better person than I am, assuming such things can be quantified.  And I knew what her news was to be - an official announcement of her engagement to her boyfriend.  I can honestly say that they seem very compatible, and that I hope with all my heart that they will be happy together.  And I also am glad that they are planning on waiting a while before actually getting married.   This, surprisingly, is not the thing that made my day turn sour.  After all, I've had a lot of time to prepare myself for it.  I've known it was coming, and while I may not think it is the best possible way things could turn out, it is the way they are going to turn out, and I think that, as a whole, it will all work out in the end, and I am at peace with that.  After all, I don't have to be happy about it so long as she is.    It is what my sister said to me when I finally got her on the phone after playing hours of phone tag that got to me.  Let me preface this by saying that she meant it as a joke, and that I should have realized it - and that somewhere in the back of my mind I did realize it, or at least saw that things weren't adding it - but it was one of those moments of sheer gullibility when no matter how fantastic the thing the other person is saying to you sounds, even while acknowledging it, you still believe them.    So what was it she said?  Nothing so dreadful; just that she wanted me to dance at her wedding.  I thought she was being serious, and it made me mad.  Why?  Partially, I suppose, because I wanted to have a bigger part in a day that is so special.  Partially because dancing is a very special and sacred thing to me, and not to be entered into in such a manner - with me out of shape and in the environment of a wedding.  But I do know one thing.  I shouldn't have gotten so upset.  But I did, and even as I did I felt bad, because my sister doesn't ever purposely set out to upset people - she is too nice.  And its not even like her to do something like this - the whole joke was my father's idea.  Perhaps I am just too sensitive.  In some ways I don't like the idea of my sister getting married because it will mean things will never go back to the way they were, even though that would hardly be the only thing preventing a return.  I guess I just don't like change so much.  Having typed all this out - well, that and consumption of more of my birthday chocolate, has made me feel a lot better.  Now, I should really try and do some work before the day is complete.

      And read today's  urlLink Opinion Journal piece by Christopher Hitchens .  He is a brilliant writer and thinker, in my opinion, even when I disagree with him, and he has been especially amazing in his pro-war writing since 9/11.  Here is his explanation of why Iraq, that it was not just some random choice made for political motives, but that it was the right choice based on the history of the region:   But this "Heart of Darkness" element is part of the case for regime-change to begin with. A few more years of Saddam Hussein, or perhaps the succession of his charming sons Uday and Qusay, and whole swathes of Iraq would have looked like Fallujah. The Baathists, by playing off tribe against tribe, Arab against Kurd and Sunni against Shiite, were preparing the conditions for a Hobbesian state of affairs. Their looting and beggaring of the state and the society--something about which we now possess even more painfully exact information--was having the same effect. A broken and maimed and traumatized Iraq was in our future no matter what.   Obviously, this prospect could never have been faced with equanimity. Iraq is a regional keystone state with vast resources and many common borders. Its implosion would have created a black hole, sucking in rival and neighboring powers, tempting them with opportunist interventions and encouraging them to find ethnic and confessional proxies. And who knows what the death-throes of the regime would have been like? We are entitled, on past experience, to guess. There could have been deliberate conflagrations started in the oilfields. There might have been suicidal lunges into adjacent countries. The place would certainly have become a playground for every kind of nihilist and fundamentalist. The intellectual and professional classes, already gravely attenuated, would have been liquidated entirely.   Go and read the whole thing.  He makes, as he as consistently done, a logical case not only for the war in general, but for the direction the war has taken.  And while you're at it, perhaps you should just peruse  urlLink the Opinion Journal  page every day, since I'm always recommending them.  I'll have to put a link to them over on the side.

      Today is my birthday.  I am 24 years old today.  It was not much fun growing up with an April Fools Day birthday, but as I was not popular and, as a consequence, no one knew who I was or cared when my birthday was, it could have been a lot worse.  I suppose it probably was for my twin sister (we're fraternal, for those who don't know), who actually was popular, and everyone knew who she was, though I never bothered to ask.  Everyone says it was harder to grow up unpopular, and I suppose that is true where the popular kids make fun of the others.  But mostly, they just let me alone.  Perhaps it was some unspoken understanding between them and my sister, who was among them, that I was not to be harassed.  Hmm...how exactly did I get off on this tangent?  Oh yeah, it's my birthday.  A friend from school brought me some very good chocolate yesterday - and over the course of the day, I ate exactly all of it, save the two pieces I gave away.  Then, I came home last night, and more chocolate had arrived from home.  I didn't eat any then, for fear of getting ill, but I'm sure I'll plow into them today.  I sure do wish chocolate was considered healthy.

      I struggled all day yesterday to think of something to say about this atrocious event, and then I woke up this morning and checked my email to find  urlLink that Peggy Noonan had already done it for me .  In a response that I have not yet heard from others, and one I felt myself, but couldn't articulate, she writes:   The pictures that television appropriately mostly did not show and the Internet inevitably mostly did were horrifying in a way that was reminiscent of the first still pictures of the Trade Center victims of 9/11. It was like seeing people in business suits falling through the air again. It was as if someone pointed a camera at evil and actually caught it in the act.   It goes without saying that I see this as more evidence that we need to continue the fight.  No one said it was going to be easy, and here's more proof that it isn't.  But the only things worth fighting for sometimes are the difficult battles.  And this is perhaps the most important and difficult battle at all.  I'm not even sure it can be completely won.  But still, all that can be done must be done.  Sides must be taken.  In this, the President is right.  This isn't the time for nuance, for rationalization.  It is a time for action.  Carefully, thoughtfully planned action, of course, but action nonetheless.  Things like this must be stopped.  I do not know how many reports of such violence, from whatever part of the world they might occur, and upon whatever group of people they might be perpetrated, that I can bear being witness to.  We are all witnesses, and we must never forget that which it is we are fighting for.  I witnessed 9/11 firsthand.  I heard the loud boom and felt the low rumble as the planes went into the towers, and I looked out of my window, and I witnessed the towers on fire.  I was impacted personally in such a small way - aside from seeing it personally, I was inconvenienced so slightly, in comparison to what others went through, in comparison to the victims and their families.  But I felt so much anger afterwards, and a part of it was specifically based on having seen the event.  And that anger has never gone away.  It has settled, so that it is like a numb pain that every now and again rises to the surface.  Every time I see something like this, despite not witnessing it firsthand, I get a little resurge of that anger.    This is why I worry that Americans are getting complacent, because I see the evidence of it, yet I don't and can't possibly understand how it could happen.  I suspect that some of it is a defense mechanism, because it is still too painful and difficult for a lot of people to even talk about 9/11.  But I think some discomfort is to be had by all, especially given that there are men and women out there right now fighting for us, specifically because of 9/11.  So I have deliberately not pushed it out of my mind.  It is not always on the surface of my consciousness, but it indeed haunts all my thoughts.  It is always with me, even if it goes unspoken.  I can only hope that others feel the same way, and that they are just not openly expressing their feelings, yet they are bubbling below the surface, and they are conscious of all that has happened - and that, even if they don't agree that this war is the answer, they will never, ever forget why it is being faught.

      Okay, so my two weeks of freewheeling and fancy free-ing are over.  Tomorrow, I return to a somewhat normal schedule, when I start school.  Yay for summer school!  Not really, but I'm trying a little reverse psychology on myself. I am looking forward to having a schedule, and having somewhere to be at specific times, as I don't really do the whole detached aimless thing too well.  Hopefully, this will make me better about blogging and not worse.  Though the next couple of weeks will be busy for me, with work, and class, and trying to get the writing competition papers read.  So we shall see.    It's a busy week coming up in other ways as well.  The new Harry Potter movie opens on Friday.  I'm contemplating a midnight showing in my neighborhood, but I don't know if I'll be up for it then.  In fact, considering my busy-ness, I should probably wait, as I probably will, as I detest crowds.  But then again, my curiousity and desire to see it might just get the better of me.    Also the Tonys are this weekend.  Only having seen two shows that are nominated for anything - and really, only two shows period - I do not have much of a stake in the outcome, but I am interested to watch nonetheless.    More fun with friends also promises to visit me soon!  So it will not all be boring books and slightly less boring work, so don't feel too sorry for me.  As I'm sure you won't...  And now, to get a good night's sleep, for once, to prepare for the busy day tomorrow.  Or perhaps I'll just watch the rest of the Lakers game, though if they win (as I'm sure they will) I'd be too depressed, so on second thought maybe I won't.    Until tomorrow...

      I've just been in a kind of a funk, brought on by what I do not know.  It's always like this when a semester ends, I just find myself wandering aimlessly, unsure of what to do with myself.  As a consequence, I end up doing nothing.  Not that I've done nothing.  I've been working.  I'm doing research for two professors this summer.  For one of them, I've been researching tax malpractice cases.  For the other one, I've been looking into motive in criminal law.  It's been fun and interesting so far.    I've also done other things.  I've rented some movies, and watched a lot of TV, and gone to see a movie with one friend and a play with another.  I also finally got all of my grades, and not only did I not fail, I had my best semester yet in law school, much to my incredible surprise.  I also think I've finally worked out my schedule for the fall, and it will once again, I believe, only be three days a week of class.  Woo hoo!  That said, some of the classes are not going to be the fun things I planned on taking, basically because I think taking some other more practical things are more important.  But we shall see.  I have a little time to change my mind.    I've also been taking vitamins, and I finally went to the grocery store so that the living off of takeout existence has ended for the time being.  And I'm holding my breath hoping my loans come in soon so that I will be broke no longer, and can stop living off my credit cards, temporary though that state of life might be.    I haven't watched the news at all, or kept up with world events.  I haven't had the heart or the stomach for it, to tell you the truth.  But I will be picking this back up, as it is my civic responsibility to keep myself informed and to talk about the things that are really important not just to me, but to the world at large.    I will also be trying to start an exercise regimen, hoping that getting out into the glorious summer days with energy and vigor will help lift my spirits a bit, and prepare me for the trials and tribulations and the business ahead.  Summer school is fast approaching, and then I will have not only work, but class to read for, and starting this Friday, writing competition papers to grade, so my work will be cut out for me.  Never fear, I also plan healthy doses of fun along the way.  A friend is coming to visit soon, and my family soon after, as well as my last summer o' fun with Christina before she leaves to go live with the crazy country music lovin' folk in Nashville.  I should be busy enough to stay out of trouble, at the very least.

      Blogging will be light today, as I am going to spend most of the day working.  It's been fun being lazy, but I know there are many things I need to do, some of which I'm getting paid for, and it is no longer an option to put them off.  So it's back to the grind I go.

      Okay, tonight were the season finales of my traditional shows, i.e. "The West Wing" and "Law & Order."  Only they aren't really my shows anymore, especially "The West Wing."  This episode was only worthwhile for the presence, albeit brief, of Jason Isaacs, even though I could only understand about half of what he said.  Don't ask me what else happened, because I honestly didn't follow the episode too well, having missed last weeks lead in.    "Law & Order" fared better, though instead of being ripped from the headlines, it was ripped direct from Patricia Highsmith and Alfred Hitchcock.  Yes, that's right, it was a variation on the theme of  Strangers on a Train , with women instead of men and minus the homosocial overtones and homosexual undertones.  It was also done well enough that it didn't become obvious quickly, and with a fleeting reference to Hitchcock from D.A. Arthur Branch.  But the highlight was the sendoff for Jerry Orbach.  It was done with just the right amount of nostalgia and not a moment more of lingering than necessary.  His presence on the show will surely be missed.

      Randy Johnson  urlLink has pitched a perfect game , becoming the oldest pitcher in MLB history to do so.  And they say life ends at 40.  He compares this performance to his earlier no-hitter back in 1990:   "That was far from perfect," he recalled. "I was a very young pitcher who didn't have any idea where the ball was going. I was far from being a polished pitcher. Fourteen years later, I've come a long way as far as knowing what I want to do."   It sounds very exciting.  I only wish I had seen it instead of just reading about it.

      I finally have some cool Google ads appearing on my blog...for some odd reason, though I very rarely talk about Harry Potter (even though I am a fan - though, having perused the Potter fan sites, I am definitely not a fanatic) here, I have Harry Potter related ads from Google.  Right on.  On second thought, I forgot about  urlLink this post .  At least the mystery of the Potter ads is solved.  How I could have so quickly forgotten about that which I have posted, is of course, another matter entirely.

      Tim Hulsey, blogger at  urlLink My Stupid Dog , has once again written an eloquent post on why he is a conservative.  This time, he tackles how  urlLink his transition from the academic left toward the right came about :   Even the smartest conservatives gradually bent under the pressure. One day, as we held class in the shadow of Thomas Jefferson's Rotunda, a clever fellow named Will who had heretofore passionately defended America against all attacks, threw up his hands and gave up the fight. He was licked. "I guess America really is just for old, white, bigoted males after all," he said, dejected.  Would it surprise you to know that I nearly cried? It certainly surprised me then. Like a freight train at full throttle, the final lines of Pope's Dunciad clattered through my brain:  Lo! thy dread empire, CHAOS! is restor'd; Light dies before thy uncreating word: Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall; And Universal Darkness buries all.  It was the triumph of the Adversary: As an emissary of left-wing academia I had won, and I did not want to win. Now I can see that though part of me thought my students needed a left-wing, anti-American viewpoint, another part of me propagated it because I wanted them to prove me wrong and take their rightful place as American free-thinkers. (Students, if you can't agree with your professors' leftist boilerplate, take heart: Chances are good they don't really agree with it, either.) Of course, this was about as thoroughly wrong-headed as wrong-headed folk pedagogy could get: A teacher should never deliberately present falsehood so his students can discover the truth on their own.  It took me years to figure that one out; I didn't realize any of it then, or at best realized it very dimly. (For a former teacher, I can be a pretty slow learner.) I only knew that I had committed a great wrong, that some reparation had to be made, and that -- since there were about two minutes left in the class period -- I would have to make amends very soon, and quickly. I spoke up as soon as Will finished, and it was with an unexpected tongue of flame:  "No. Not you, Will. If anyone else gave up on America I could accept it. But not you.  "Yes, America has injustice. Every country does. Yes, UVA's founder Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. But he also wrote that 'All men are created equal.' Slavery lost that fight, equality won. That's because America belongs to people like Jefferson who criticize injustice and work to change it, even if they can't always understand what their words and actions truly mean.  "When America sees it's in the wrong it changes for the better. Thirty-three years ago, we didn't have any Black students at UVA. Now we do, and everybody is better off for the change. What's more, our students aren't just Black, but every race and ethnicity imaginable, and they come here from all over the globe. Even Gay students like me have found a place at the table, when thirty years ago or even fifteen, we'd have been unthinkable.  "In other countries, people who speak out against the government are executed. They get lined up against a wall and shot. Gay people like me fare even worse -- we get stoned to death. But here, we've made a national holiday to celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King, our greatest gadfly. Ronald Reagan even signed the bill! So Will, don't let your professors hand this country's legacy over to bigots. These people lost the fight over what America is; they're dead, buried and forgotten. The country we have now is something to be proud of, something to defend, something to bring to others who don't have ... this ...."  And I stopped cold. I was running late, unconscionably late; I would make my students late for their next class. Yet none of them had left, and what's more, other students walking past the Rotunda had stopped to listen to me. I had drawn a small crowd unawares. And I recognized the look on their faces, because I had seen it during my Gay-activist days, when I delivered news and information each month to Gays and Lesbians all over Virginia. These students were curious, fascinated, perhaps even hungry. They were listening -- and, unaccustomed to this situation, I didn't know what to do or where to go next. I mumbled an apology for keeping them too long and for making a spectacle of myself, then dismissed the class, a bit ashamed.  "It's okay, Tim," one student said. "You did well."   Please go and read it all.  It is an incredibly moving piece, if not only because it mirrors my own track, though I can honestly say that I was never a leftist.  But I was a sight more liberal than I am today, that is for sure.  I abandoned Mississippi party to get away from a brand of conservatism that I found detestable.  And I still do find it to be so.  And I still get into debates with my parents and other family members over issues with which I disagree with them.  But my parents are not bigots.  I know this now, though I'm not sure if you'd asked me five years ago if I would have answered in the negative, at least not honestly and whole-heartedly.  Now I know that they are merely wrong, and that I disagree with them on a great many things.    Politics has always been a tricky business for me.  I see and hear things, even if they are very minor things that have very little impact on the day to day lives of Americans, that people I would otherwise be inclined to agree with have to say, and their lack of class and their lack of reason, and I find myself unable to get past it.  I suppose I have always seen the world in black and white, and one ill fated and misplaced statement that turns my stomach is enough to turn me off of someone forever.  And in politics, it is very rare indeed to find someone who is always so accomodating and agreeable to my disposition, especially since my own political beliefs tend to cut across party lines and America is a party town.  I have no idea what any of this has to do with what I've just quoted, but it just started coming out, so I figured I might as well type it.  But I believe that my line of thought here is indicative of my difficulty lableing myself a Republican, or even a conservative.  But I believe that if labels must be applied, as they are wont to be, then both of them are closer than their negatives to describing me.  Immediately after September 11, when no other issue seemed important and worthy of discussion, and the kings of the religious right were shot down in their insinuations that American debauchery had brought the terror upon us, I thought perhaps I had finally found my political home.  But now that memories have faded (too soon, I believe) and it is an election year, and other issues crowd the plate, I find myself disconnected yet again.  This is not to say that I do not know exactly how I am going to vote in November, because I do, because for me, there truly is only one issue (well, for me personally there are others, but they are not ones that will any time soon be resolved by the political process).  I think that, despite recent setbacks, Bush and Co. have done a good job addressing the needs of the war on terror, and I certainly prefer them to the alternative.  And I cannot imagine anything happening between now and the election to change my mind, and I say this perfectly mindful that a great many terrible things potentially loom on the horizon.  But so long as this war must be fought, and this is something that will not change by November, then my support and my vote only has one place to go.  Because nothing is perfect - and that includes candidates for President.  There is just more or less perfect for me.    On a lighter and completely unrelated note (only because I am too lazy to post this and create another one), Tim Hulsey also has an  urlLink incredibly funny post on the film  Dogville  .  I have not seen the movie, and I'm not sure I ever will, but this is highly amusing nonetheless.  In order to make this tangentially related, I quote this:   To call the movie anti-American doesn't go far enough: It is just plain anti-human.   He then proposes some drinking games to make the film more bearable.

      Sorry there has been no posting.  I have been taking a break from all things of late.  It's hard sometimes.  I've been bored out of my mind, and it's sometimes hard to motivate oneself to get over the boredom and get up and do things.   Another reason for the lack of posting has been that I have been wanting to post something meaningful, something about my anger at many world events at present.  But I have not been able to find the words.  Anger is not an eloquent emotion.  So I have persistently struggled with those emotions over the past couple of days, trying to put them down.  I will eventually succeed, but it is a more arduous task that I have the energy for at the moment.  Until then, I will tell you of the fun I've been up to, in the form of major movie time.  I love film, and I have been too busy to appreciate it of late, but now that I find myself with very little to occupy my time, I have gone a little crazy.  First, I watched Big Fish.  I had wanted to see this movie since it was out in theaters, and it just never happened.  I was supposed to see it with my sister over Christmas, but it had not opened at home yet.  Then, when I got back up here, I found no one to see it with and then, before I knew it, it was gone.  Should have gone by myself.  But, alas, I did not.  But I rented it this weekend, and I really liked it.  I think it was almost the perfect example of how a familiar story can be told in an unfamiliar and wonderful way.   Then, for the surprises.  I wasn't planning on renting Kill Bill, Vol. 1, when I went to the video store, but I walked by it, and something told me to rent it.  And I was not disappointed.  I actually really liked it, having only one small quibble toward the end of the movie.  It wasn't the violence and gore that bothered me, it was the fact that it all just went on for too long, and I started to lose my interest in the film.  For all I know, this was some sort of tribute to Asian cinema, but my complete lack of familiarity with these films puts me at somewhat of a disadvantage.  I actually was more impressed with the other homages in the film, particularly the references to the spaghetti westerns.  It was a nice blending of styles.  And Vol. 2, which I went to see at the theater after liking the first one, was even better, helped greatly along by the presence of David Carradine, who was merely ephemeral in the first film.  I can see that they would benefit from being screened as one, though.  Finally, yesterday, I watched Matchstick Men.  I liked this film, even more because it was not at all what I expected it to be.  It was finely crafted, and really really surprising to me.  So I guess I'd say I liked it.  All in all it was a very successful rental trip.  And I still have one movie to go, 21 Grams.  So I'll be back to present my thoughts, though I'm expecting a very heavy and depressing experience.  But these are emotions that are easier to express.

      Well, it's hot and summer is here.  The air conditioner is out and in the window and currently making life as bearable as possible.  Today has been a lazy day.  I should have taken a nap, given my complete lack of sleep last night, but I am still awake, not doing much of anything.  Watching "Ghosts of Mississippi" on Bravo.  It's not a great movie, but I always really enjoy James Woods' performance in it.  He manages to create a character that is oh, so distasteful yet utterly believable at the same time.  Sort of a human caricature.  Even though it gets some things about the South wrong, like almost every movie does, it sort of doesn't grate on my nerves the way some other movies do.  It paints a portrait of Mississippi that, while not flattering, is not exactly damning either.  And the accents aren't completely wretched, so that's a plus.  In other news, I did the unthinkable today.  I went to Wendy's (this is not the unthinkable part) and...wait for it...ordered something other than the spicy chicken sandwich.  Someone recommended that I try the new homestyle chicken sandwich, and it was well worth the try because I highly enjoyed it.  Perhaps I'll have to work it into a rotation with the spicy.  I'm also trying to plan my schedule for the fall, since I have to register on Monday.  They sure don't give you much time when you don't have to be thinking about the law or law school, do they?  Anyway, I'm trying to find something that won't be too difficult on me.  But there are lots of things I am interested in taking, so we'll see.  This summer I'll be taking Criminal Procedure and Administrative Law, so that'll be nice.  At this moment I'm actually looking forward to taking them.  Of course, when the moment arrives, I'm sure I'll be groaning and complaining about it as usual.  Not looking forward to the hot commute.  Hopefully the summer won't be too brutal.  9 minutes until Law & Order comes on TNT.  I'm really looking forward to being able to watch it.  I'll pull out a copy of the fall schedule, sit back and settle in for a long night of television viewing and schedule planning.  Yet a part of me can't help but think that I don't deserve to be so relaxed, that I didn't work hard enough over the past semester to have really earned it.   Not that it's going to stop me of course...

      It is such a wonderful feeling to have awoken this morning, even though with a slight hangover and from very little sleep, and realize that I have nothing that I absolutely have to be doing right now.  As nice as it is to be done with exams, there is that little creeping feeling that will be with me until I receive my grades.  But as there is absolutely nothing to be done about that now...  So congrats to all my law school friends who are done.  Congrats also to all those 3Ls I know who are graduating - I am so jealous.  Oh, and a special congrats to Christina, Simone upon their graduation from NYU, which should be going on, wrapping up as I type this.  Woo hoo!  You guys made it and you are free!  Okay, I'm off to do nothing for now.  I'll be back later for more substantive posting.

      Well, just took 10 multiple choice question quiz after having read through the entire semester's worth of notes just once - 6/10, not bad, considering before I read through said notes (thanks, Mike, I owe you one) I knew just about nothing.  Normally, I do not rely on multiple choice to get me through, but I feel like on this exam, I will have to hope that the multiple choice and short answers save me, because my essays are going to be rambling messes.   It's all going to be over soon.  Going back to re-read, and see how much more I can glean before tomorrow night.  Woo hoo!

      Okay, so I just finished my third exam.  It wasn't bad.  There was one set of questions that totally blew my mind and confused me since I wasn't exactly sure what he was asking for, but hey, it happens, right?  Overall, I think I did OK, and most of all it is over.  Now to the real test of my will...one to go, and it's the hardest of all, the one I'll be least prepared for.  Oh, Lord, please just let me make it through.

      In  urlLink this interview , Gary Oldman makes the following statement:   I'm not the subtlest actor.   Hmm...looking over  urlLink a list of his movies , it's almost difficult to understand what he means.  Okay, stepping off the sarcasm box (don't worry, it isn't you - I'm not any better at sarcasm in person), seriously, dude, nothing like stating the obvious.  That aside, I still love him.  And the interview is well worth a read.  Another highlight:   Q: And are your kids excited about you being in this film? A: Oh, they're thrilled. I'm a hero at school.   "This film" for those of you not in the know, refers to  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , which explains the link above.  Yes, I am an proud Potter fan and am very excited for the movie to come out.  Wanna make something of it?

      Woah!  What the heck is going on with blogger?  It's all different.  I hate it when they change things around on me.  Takes a while to get with the program and try to find things.  Most annoying.  No time to check it out now, so hard to say whether I will like it better or worse.  In deep trouble exam wise.  Feeling pretty good about Evidence tonight.  Had a crisis moment on Saturday studying with someone from another section.  But returned home to studying what my prof has taught me, and I am feeling more confident now.  We shall see come tonight for sure.  The problem now is Business Organizations.  This class has been a thorn in my side all semester, and now it is getting ready to pay me back for all my neglect big time.  Here's hoping I don't fail.  I keep lowering my expectations, but right now, lack of failure or a D or something is really all I can ask for.  And hopefully I'll do OK in everything else this semester to help balance out the lot.  My new mantra:  It'll all be over on Wednesday, it'll all be over on Wednesday, it'll all be over on Wednesday...

      #1 Why am I so jealous of you? Why do I feel that you have taken something that belongs to me, taken my place? Why do I feel I know you so well, when I don't really know you at all? Why am I afraid of you?  Because when I look at you, I see myself, only a better, more complete, more functional version.  You should give me hope, hope that I don't have, that I don't get from anyone.  Hope that I won't be me forever, or that the me I'll be then will be better than the one I am now, that somehow I will get better and stronger. But you make me feel inferior and imperfect, unwanted and unloved. Why do I blame you when there is only me? Why do I wish I were you?  #2 Why can't I tell you I'm in love with you? Why, when I look at you, do I want to cry? Why do I feel I missed our chance when I know I never had one, not with you, not ever?   Why do I think that we are so much alike?  Because I know that we are not, that for all the similarities I've concocted in my head we are very different people, ones who could not function well together, not like that.  We'd be miserable and unhappy, yet I can't help but think that I'd enjoy a new, different kind of misery, anything to escape the one I'm in now. But you don't even know how I feel. Why don't you know how I feel? Why do I feel so lonely whenever I'm around you?  #3 Why couldn't I say anything to you? Why, when I caught your eye, and you caught mine, could I not finally acknowledge that I noticed you? Why, when the opportunity repeated itself, did I still not jump at the chance? Why did I shift my glance away the last time I saw you, even knowing it would be the last time I'd see you?  Because I'm such a fool who doesn't ever do anything about anything.  I like to sit and imagine myself some tragic figure, destined for misery and gloom and unhappiness and pain.  Because I'd much rather feel sorry for myself than do anything about it.  Because you are gone. But you don't even know who I am. Why do I wish you knew who I was? Why did I not just smile?  #4 Why am I such a fool around you? Why must I make things so dysfunctional for us? Why must I take everything as a slight, when it is never intended as such? Why do I expect you to remember every little trifling thing?  Because I never forget, and I expect everyone to be like me in all the right ways and unlike me in all the wrong ones.  Because I think I need you more than you need me.  Because I can see you growing beyond me, leaving me, and I do not want or like to be left behind.  Because I want to be important to someone, and you are the closest I've got. But I'm not that important to you. Why do I think I should be? Why can't I just tell you so?

      I am taking a much needed break, heading out to dinner with friends.  Perhaps when I receive my grades for this semester I will be sorry I did this.  But right now, my sanity requires it.  If I don't do this, I may get better grades (though at this point, I'm sure it won't make much of a difference), but I might also snap before finals are over, which would be worse.

      Well, I've just done the impossible and taken two law school exams in less than 24 hours.  Earlier in the semester, when the future ahead of me was bright and unclouded, or at least when I wasn't worried about exams, I thought "oh, it doesn't matter that I have exams back to back like that, since I don't have any exams for over a week from the end of class to the first of my finals, I'll be fine, I don't need to get one of them moved or anything."  Well, now I rather wish I had gotten one of them moved, which is one of my few rights as a law student, but, alas, I took a whimiscal and romantic approach to the whole process, which would account for the feeling I have now like I've been hit by a truck.  And it isn't even over yet.  I still have two more to go.  Yes, folks, that's right, and they are two biggies.  I honestly think I could fail Business Organizations.  At the very least, I am expected to do poorly and have it as a constant anchor on my GPA, in all its 4 credit splendor.  Ah, well.  It could be worse.  On a better front, I sort of have my summer plans worked out, and it will involve the actual earning of money, which is something I am in very desperate need of.  Not a lot, mind you, but every little bit helps.  And for this I don't even mind spending my summer in Queens.  It is cooler there than it is in Manhattan anyway.   Well, I guess I'd better get back to it, as they say.  Though the lack of sleep has given me a headache that I'm quite sure no knowledge can permeate, especially not boring law school knowledge (though I'm sure I could fill my head with useless trivia) so I may just give it up at some point and rejoin the world of the studious and the living tomorrow.

      Sorry for the lack of blogging, but I am deep in the bog here studying.  For the next week or so the posting may be skimpy.  But never fear, I shall return.  As a personal aside to Mike Jackson...if you're reading this, yes it is me, Shannon Black, erstwhile Kubrick fan, and still a fan when I have the time to remember it.  I tried emailing you, but I don't know if you got it or not.  If you did, the pardon the redundancy.  If not, then you did find me, and you can use the link at the right to reach me by email, should you wish.  Until then, people, c'est la vie.

       urlLink Drudge  has linked to a story about  urlLink a bicycle accident that John Kerry had .  Never fear.  He'll be fine.   Normally, this would be fodder for the late night talk show guys.  And it probably will be.  But is it also possibly the most Presidential thing Kerry has done?  Fans of  urlLink the West Wing will certainly agree .  Or at least they'll not think I'm insane.  For those who do, read on for a description of the pilot episode of that show:   WHITE HOUSE STAFF HOLDS DOWN FORT UNTIL INJURED PRESIDENT (MARTIN SHEEN) RETURNS IN PREMIERE OF 'THE WEST WING' -- The entire White House staff bristles with activity when it's learned that the President (Martin Sheen)  injured himself during a bicycle accident , and his absence becomes a factor as chief of staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer) must juggle a host of impending crises, including a mass boatlift of Cuban refugees approaching the Florida coast and the reaction of conservative Christians to a controversial televised comment by deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford). Meanwhile, Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), the trouble-prone deputy communications director, unknowingly spends the night with a call girl (guest star Lisa Edelstein) and then makes another critical error during a children's White House tour. The series is from Emmy Award-nominated Aaron Sorkin ("Sports Night," "A Few Good Men") and Emmy winners Tommy Schlamme ("Sports Night") and John Wells (NBC's "ER). Moira Kelly, Allison Janney and Richard Schiff also star.    The emphasis is, of course, mine.  The parallels are not absolute:  President Bartlet rode his bicycle into a tree and he was injured.  And of course, he was President already.  Still, perhaps Kerry should take heart, and maybe even make it a part of his campaign.  It couldn't hurt.

      It may not be that difficult to make me cry, but considering I am sitting in the library, rather than in the comfortable solitude of my own room, it is perhaps something of an accomplishment.    Whether you cry or not, do yourselves a favor and  urlLink go read Andrew Sullivan's email of the day .  It's a very beautiful and moving piece of writing in regards to the death of Pat Tillman.  Here's what the reader has to say about life and death:   So much value is placed on living a long life, it is easy to lose sight of the underlying assumption that the reason we hope to live long is so we have more time to live worthily. What it means to live worthily is sometimes hard to tell. People have lots of opinions about what you are supposed to be doing with your life, but when the end of the line comes, you're the one who has to lie there alone on your deathbed and reflect upon the choices you made when all is said and done. If only that reflection were done earlier in life instead of later.   Please go read the whole thing.  It's not very long and is well worth the time.

      ...that I'm  urlLink glad I still live in New York .    And it gets better.  Or weirder.  I was just thinking on the long, local train ride home from school tonight, as I listened to the new love of my life, i.e. my iPod.  I have it set on shuffle, so I never know what song I'm going to get next, and up came "Someone in a Tree" from  Pacific Overtures .  And I thought, "Hmm...I wish they'd revive that show.  I'd really, really like to see it."  Then I come home and find out they are.  Crazy.  Sometimes, I awe myself.  Actually, I almost always awe myself, but not in a good way like now.  And while we're at it, we've got more Broadway news and reason #28, as well as how depressingly out of touch I am with all of that which I used to love.  There's a  urlLink revival of  Jumpers  on Broadway .  I remember reading this play and loving it, though with Tom Stoppard plays, I think it really helps to see them.  So I know what I'll be doing once my new loan money comes in.    It's so nice to have things to look forward to.

      I'm slowly becoming convinced that any of life's mysteries can be solved by watching  Law & Order .    I was going to stop there, but I figured that such a bold and impressive statement such as that might require more explanation.  The story begins with when Christina took me to see  Assassins  for my birthday.  A slight digression here...I'm a major Sondheim freak, who has enjoyed every production I've ever seen of one of his shows, no matter how bad it might have been objectively speaking.  But this production of  Assassins , currently running on Broadway at Studio 54, is definitely, objectively speaking worth seeing.  The production was originally meant to run over two years ago, but it was halted post 9/11 both for the general nature of the show - because it is about a bunch of people who want to kill, and some who do kill, the President of the United States - and the specific instance of Samuel Byck, a would-be assassin who plotted to kill Nixon by flying a plane into the White House.  Understandably postponed.  But now it is here, and it is a very good production.    Bet you're wishing I'd get to the point, so I will.  One of the actors in the show was so familiar to me.  Yet I couldn't place him.  And not just familiar in the "oh I've seen him in something before," but that something could be anything, and certainly not important to you.  No, this guy was familiar from somewhere very specific and very important - I could tell, yet I still couldn't place him.  There was no intermission in the show, so I couldn't look it up, and by the end I was so enthralled by the production, and very into talking to Christina since I don't get to see her as often as I used to when we were roommates, so there's always more to say (as I recall I'd also had a particularly bad day that day, and I just now recalled something that happened to me that day that was especially strange, especially after everything else, but that's for another day since I've already had too many digressions).  On the train ride home it didn't occur to me either - instead I perused some Fitzgerald short stories.  Anyway, several days later it finally occurred to me to look him up in the Playbill and find out his name:  Denis O'Hare.  He played Charles Guiteau, who assassinated James Garfield.  He was very good in the show, but then Guiteau is something of my favorite (if you can really pick a "favorite" assassin) in the show.  I scanned his bio, and he seems pretty famous by Broadway standards, but I've not seen him in any other show before.  Then, I see it toward the end of his bio, something that is seen so often when I go to the theater that I'm surprised it didn't occur to me sooner that this might be the connection.  That, of course, is the ubiquitous Law & Order credit.  That said, even reading this was not my "A-Ha" moment.  After all, there are a great many episodes of the show, and while I've seen a great many of them, I still had the feeling that my connection here was something more than a tenuous connection to some random episode of the show.  And how right I was, as I found out last night.  After my long day of study, I arrived home (after a debacle at the local Wendy's - again, a subject for another time) and started doing the only thing I have the energy for any more in the evenings, watching TV.  TNT had one of their marathon evenings of  Law & Order  episodes, so I tuned in, only halfway watching, mildly interested but also distracted by other things.  Then, at 11:03 or so, I looked up at the TV, and something clicked in the back of my head.  Surely this wasn't one of my very favorite episodes ever.  I got up and went over to the TV, and sure enough it was indeed what I'd consider my very favorite episode of the show ever, one from season 6 entitled "Pro Se."  And then, even though he wasn't to enter the world of the show for a while longer, I got an image of the defendant from this episode, and I realized that it was him.  Sure enough, when his face appeared on screen a little latter, ratty though his appearance was, it all came together.  Mr. O'Hare was not just on any episode of  Law & Order , he was on my very favorite episode, performing one of the best guest appearances I've ever seen on the show.    I, sadly, felt very validated in this moment.  But hey, you take any validation you can get, right?  As an aside, he was in one of my very favorite episodes of the  Law & Order  spinoff  Special Victims Unit,  where we see that Dr. Skoda (the shrink played by the very cool J.K. Simmons, who was guest star on  Without a Trace  this Thursday - anyone think I watch too much TV?) is more than a curmudgeon, that he actually has a heart as well.  But I digress yet again.  I really gotta work on that.  Uh...yeah.  I'm going back to work now.

      ...I fell down the stairs again.  I don't know when I will learn that I cannot walk up the escalator.  It moves by itself and it is really unnecessary.  I don't know what possessed me to try it today.  I felt a little bit daring, though, so I thought what the heck...perhaps I just felt like moving, to just keep on moving, carried away by the tunes from my iPod.  Whatever spirit moved me, move me it did, right on up the escalator.  And at first it went rahter well, if I do say so myself.  I was proud of my prowess, as I weaved and dashed between those less bold souls who were contendedly relying on the motor to carry them to the top.  I was graceful and lyrical.  Then, the song changed and I caught my foot.  My knee crashed into one of the escalator stairs.  Now I have two holes in my knee - battle scars from my hard fought war with the escalator.   Just in case you're keeping score, it won.

      ESPN.com has some fun things related to the best sports movies.  First of all, there is a poll to  urlLink rank the best sports movies of the past 25 years , in celebration of ESPN's 25th birthday.  You can go and vote, and then tune in at a later date to see how the experts feel.  This poll is somewhat weak because it eliminates all those great, older sports movies, such as  Pride of the Yankees  or the musical  Take Me Out to the Ballgame .  They also have, on Page 2,  urlLink a comparion of fiction and reality , per the Cleveland Indians and  Major League .  There's also a  urlLink very funny article by Bill Simmons , also on Page 2, about the "evil women of sports movies" and the foibles of watching deleted scenes of your favorite movies.  Here he is on his experience getting to see deleted scenes from the upcoming release of  Hoosiers :   No Wet Blanket Girlfriend was worse than Fleener. She didn't invent the genre, but she did perfect it. I was already expecting the worst from the Hickory rally scene ... and then ... there was Myra pulling Coach Dale aside, batting her eyelashes, dusting off a smile that hadn't been used since 1938, her voice softer than ever before. She looked like -- gasp! -- a real person. Myra thanked the coach for everything, wished him luck in the game and announced she was moving to Chicago, win or lose. "I just wanted to thank you," she says. "I wouldn't have had the courage to do this without you."  Wait a second ... what? You're Myra Fleener! You may as well be Satan! You're thanking someone?  Then she drops this bomb: "You know, Chicago isn't that far away." Or something like that. I can't remember the exact wording, because there was blood spurting from my eyes while I was watching it. Basically, she was telling Coach Dale she wanted to continue their relationship in long-distance form. Like two college kids. What was this, the season finale of The OC?  "No!" I kept screaming. "Noooooooo! This can't be happening! MAKE IT STOP!!"   And that's when they escorted me out of the building. But not before I learned three important lessons. First, be careful what you wish for. Second, deleted scenes are usually deleted for a reason. And third, Wet Blanket Girlfriends are much more useful in sports movies than Dutifully Supportive Girlfriends. Find a woman who doesn't believe, a woman with a knack for twisting the knife, and you'll probably find a pretty good sports movie that comes with her.   I will admit I don't remember the movie all that well, though I remember a vague feeling of liking it.  But this piece is still very funny, nonetheless.  Anyone can relate to that deleted scenes thing - or at least any movie fan can.  My favorite sports film is probably  Field of Dreams .  This movie is wonderful, and lyrical, and I never tire of watching it.  Not only is it one of the best sports movies, it is one of the best films ever made.  And I say this as the person on the planet who is probably least enamored with Kevin Costner.  He is not what makes the movie good, though it is serviceable in it (I feel the same way about  The Untouchables ).  The movie really captures the essence of what makes baseball so special, and this is no easy feat, since it is very hard to put into words, except to say that it is part of the very fabric of the nation itself, one of the few things that are truly American.  Much like the art of movies itself, which while it developed somewhat contemporaneously around the world, was perfected in Hollywood.  It is also for this reason that baseball makes the best movies.  There is something magical about baseball and film, something that comforts us and makes us think that we are not alone.  When you see a really good movie, or a really exciting ball game, it makes you feel connected to the other people around you, from close friends to perfect strangers, and all of you leave understanding something that you didn't understand before, sharing a secret and a commonality with those who were there that those who weren't could never comprehend.  There are some good movies about other sports - Oliver Stone's surprisingly good  Any Given Sunday  is a notable example - but baseball has definitely provided the most fertile ground.  What's the best scene, you ask?  Well, aside from every frame of Field of Dreams, I think that honor would have to go to the very last scene in  Eight Men Out , about the Chicago Black Sox scandal of 1919.  If you have not seen the movie, feel free to read on or not, as I really don't think it ruins anything - unless you're one of those people who likes to go into a movie pure.  In the scene, which takes place several years after the scandal was over, a bunch of guys sit around watching a game of some sort in New Jersey.  They are speculating about one of the players on the field, wondering if it is really Shoeless Joe Jackson playing under an assumed name.  It is in fact him, played in the film by D.B. Sweeney.  They argue back and forth, and discuss the player's checkered past - he has now been banned from professional baseball.  Suddenly, one of Jackson's former teammates, the also-banned Buck Weaver, played by John Cusack, interjects into their conversation:  "I saw him play."  He describes him as the best.  They ask him if they think the guy playing now is him.  His very sad response:  "Nah.  Those fellas are all gone now."  This is one of the better film endings I have ever seen.  It always gets me - the pathos of it is brilliant and such a striking failure and corruption in baseball is certainly akin to the failure and corruption of the American Dream itself - and stays with me long afterwards.    But  Field of Dreams  is still the best.  The film is a wonder.  It is mysterious and strange, yet so familiar and warm at the same time.  And I can't watch it without turning into a blubbering fool.

      So, I'm walking down Lexington Avenue today, humming along silently to my iPod, a slight bounce in my step, perhaps, when all of the sudden a gloom overcame my day.  I could see, on the sidewalk up ahead, in between me and the entrance to the train - so there is no way to escape - the people from Greenpeace.  They are often on the sidewalks and in the parks, sounding their usual call, "Do you have a minute for Greenpeace?"  I should of course, have begun preparing my responses:     "Sorry, I'm in a hurry."   Or:   "Sorry, I hate the environment."   Or better yet:   "Sorry, I voted for George W. Bush."   The fact that none of those statements are particularly true does not diminish their value as a tool to irk.  It's not that I have anything particularly against Greepeace.  I've not had much of a problem with them, though I'm told some of their representatives can be particularly forceful in trying to get you to talk to them.  Mainly, they annoy me because they are standing on the sidewalk and a busy part of the day, taking up space and getting in the way, interrupting the free flow of traffic.    I, alas, made none of my witty responses.  I didn't think of them until later.  Instead, I just turned up my iPod, and started straight ahead, pretending I didn't hear.  Though, I did think to myself, "Sorry, I can't hear you.  I'm too busy listening to Frank."   "...Fly me to the moon..."   There are days when the moon sounds rather nice and appealing

      The Potter fans have had a difficult couple of days.  First, someone claimed to have hacked  urlLink J.K. Rowling's Official Site  and  urlLink discovered the title of Book 6 , claiming it was  Harry Potter and the Pillar of Storge  (the "e" should have an acute accent, but I don't know how to do that).  For a while, the fans toiled in agony,  urlLink wondering if it was true or not , mostly concluding that it was not.  Then, confirmation came from Rowling herself:   urlLink it was a hoax .  Then, a new twist, as Potter fans  urlLink discovered something new on Rowling's site , another title, this one  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince , apparently a rejected title for Book 2.   urlLink The Leaky Cauldron  is  urlLink confirming that this is indeed the title of Book 6 , from a very mysterious and anonymous, but apparently reliable, source.  Now Potter fans across the globe are trying to discern the meaning of the title, and just who the mysterious "Half Blood Prince" is going to turn out to be.  If you don't believe me, just check out some of the comments on the last link.  I don't know what to think.  I do know one thing:  I trust the folks over at Leaky, so as long as they say that this is the title, I think I'll stick with them, even if I don't know the identity of their source.  They are always very cautious with the information they give out, so if they are confirming, I've pretty much got to believe it.    Knowing the title is all well and good, but I'd feel much better if I knew a release date.  Or better yet, if I actually had the book in my hand, and were reading it right now...  But, alas, I do not.  So I guess it's back to reading cases.

      Well, after a prolonged week of agony (perhaps one day I will post about my almost sick compulsion to blow every little thing WAY out of proportion - but alas, today is not that day), I have decided to continue with the reports of family fun, even though the memories are two weeks old and they are rapidly fading from my brain.    Today, the events leading up to the single most surprising event of the whole week, and a little on the event itself, namely, the fact that I recommended something to other people and  they actually ended up liking it .  I should probably offer some sort of explanation for the previous statement.  Whenever I recommend something, or pick something to see or do, usually my family ends up hating it.  I cannot tell you how many times we'd have family rental nights, when we all still lived at home, and each of us would get to pick a movie.  Everyone always hated whatever I ended up picking.  Then again, I sometimes ended up hating what I picked as well.  I remember one particularly unfortunate incident involving an Oliver Stone film which shall remain nameless...but I digress.  Anyway, everyone had settled on  Assassins , perhaps despite my recommendation, though no one held out much hope that it would be available at the TKTS booth.  I was slightly more optimistic.  Anyway, I arose bright and early (quite a feat considering I had wandered the streets of Times Square with said family the night before in search of food and only arrived home after a prolonged train ride home - prolonged because I had to wait at least 30 minutes for the darn thing to show up), and went to meet my family (more accurately, my grandmother, sister, sister's fiance, and one of my mother's students who was also on the trip) at their hotel for the incredibly short walk (a whole block almost) to the TKTS booth.  We were the first ones in line practically, which was cool.  Highlights while waiting in line:  meeting the guy in line behind us, named Brian, who was also hoping for  Assassins  tickets, seeing my sister's fiance and my mom's random student almost get hit by a cab as they ran jaywalkingly across Broadway just as the light changed, and getting to really talk to my sister and grandmother for the first time since they'd arrived.  Well, eventually, we did get the tickets we wanted, and being the first ones in line guaranteed us really good seats.  And they were really good, as we found out when we got to the theater...but I am perhaps getting ahead of myself, for why should I make this story shorter, when I could make it longer and more boring.  After we got tickets, we took a stroll through the Diamond District in search of an optometrist so that my sister's fiance could get hold of some new contacts.  We struck out there, and then wandered over to St. Patrick's Cathedral.  It was beautiful, as always.  Then we wandered some more, in search this time of ice cream, and we ended up at Bryant Park, and the public library there.    This may not seem like it took up a lot of time, but then, suddenly, it was time to go to the theater.  But not before getting distracted once or twice by clothing stores, which always create in irresistible impulse in my sister to go in.  Seriously, they have almost a hypnotic effect on her.  Eventually, though, we were able to drag her away from the light and into the darkness of the theater.  We settled in and found out that our seats were, indeed, fabulous, and that we were right next to our friend from line named Brian.  We all got drinks (I had a Jack & Coke, thank you very much - perhaps one day we'll get a post on why I like mixed drinks, but again, today is not that day - I wouldn't want to confuse anyone), and chatted a little before the show began.  As I began to explain the premise of the show, and how there wasn't a plot to speak of, I could sense everyone's eyes glaze over a bit, and I began to have that sinking feeling that I get every time I recommend something.  But I thought, oh well, at least I am going to enjoy myself.  The show was, once again, spectacular.  It was so much better than I'd remembered it.  I would recommend to anyone thinking of seeing it to get seats as close to the front of the stage as possible.  It is an intimate show, and even though Studio 54 (which, by the way is on 54th Street, hence the name - this was one of the discoveries that seemed to make the rounds in our group one by one, with someone no one hearing as each declared that they'd finally figured it out) is a small theater, it still benefits one, I would think, to be as close as possible.    As I've already indicated, everyone in the group loved the show.  And it wasn't that fake praise that I hear sometimes because people are worried about bruising my ego or hurting my feelings.  No, they really meant it.  I felt very proud, like I'd accomplished something of great import, even though I'd done nothing of the kind.   Next time, a slightly more depressing post, as we go backstage at  Movin' Out  and sit too close at the ballet and our heroine comes to a realization...well, of sorts, anyway.

      I'm really beginning to wonder if I might be invisible to anyone other than those who have actually met me and conversed with me more than once and has actually formed an opinion that they sort of like me.  Seriously.   First of all, this happens at school all the time.  I don't know how many times I will say hello to someone, a someone who I may or may not have met, only to have them either (1) look at me as if I were insane or (2) fail to recognize that anyone has said hello to them, or stands before them, at all.  This is especially true of people I have met before, who, in typical New York fashion, pretend like they have never seen you before the next time they see you, even if you had a fairly lengthy and engrossing conversation.    This certainly does nothing to help the level of my frustration.  But these are not the things that bother me the most, or make me feel the most invisible.  For while these people are most certainly being rude, they are perhaps forgivable.  I mean, it is possible that they are just in a hurry, and rather than having to stop to say "hi" and explain that they are in a hurry, they'd rather just ignore.  This is understandable, even if it isn't the best way to deal with the situation.    No, the ones that get me the most are the complete strangers, the people on the street.  Just today, for example, two different sets of people came and stood directly in front of me at the bus stop, in the middle of and completely disregarding the line, as if I were not there are all.  I wanted to shout at them "Look people, there is a line here, and believe it or not, I AM STANDING IN IT!"  But in my typical passive-aggressive style, I just stepped to the side and sighed.    Anyway, I hope this happens to other people.  Not that I'd wish ill on others, but at least it would mean that I am not, indeed, invisible.

      I know I haven't posted anything in a while.  Hence the frustration in my title.  I just can't think of anything worth saying, and those things I can think of that are worth saying, I've already said before, and I do so hate to be repetitive.  I do not have the time to fully devote myself to this great blogging adventure in the manner in which I would like.  It's kind of funny, actually.  I started this out thinking that I would have a place to vent all of my frustrations with life.  And now, in typical me fashion, I'm blogging about my frustration with blogging.  I say typical me fashion because everything I add to my live, every decision I make which I think will make things all better, only tends to have the opposite impact eventually.  I mean, everything goes along all fine at first, and then something goes wrong.  I don't know what it is.  Perhaps I just like things that are new, and when they aren't new anymore they begin to irk me.  Or perhaps I'm just on a downslide at the moment, and things will pick up again soon enough.  I'm betting it is the latter, since I have been down this road before.  All of this is to say, is to explain why I have been absent these past few days.  I even have things that I want to blog about, e.g. my recent family visit, but I can't seem to find the right words.  I got so frustrated, I just wanted to destroy something, and since blogging is not really a tangible medium (I mean, I could have destroyed my computer, but that hardly seemed a good move), I ended up deleting a saved draft of a post I had about my anger.  I was saving it for a rainy day, when I could really devote the time I needed to it.  But now I'm not sure when that'll be, or even if I had the time to devote that it would do me any good.   But don't worry.  The anger itself is still there.  And one day, I know that a confluence of events will allow me to be able to tell my story, the story of my anger, often, to me, the only story that matters.  I can't watch the news for more than five minutes without getting angry or frustrated or scared.  This must be why I spent the day yesterday (when I wasn't doing work) watching bad movies, or the Yankees/Mets game.  Sorry, Mom, but GO METS!  Perhaps this present exercise will help me come out of the blogging doldrums.  Or perhaps it will lead me to commit blogging suicide.  Either way, I hope and fear that a resolution is on the way.

      I have not blogged on either one of the brutal beheadings of American citizens that have occurred recently, and I feel the absence of anything about this on my blog is conspicuous, given my feelings and beliefs about world events, so I figured a short explanation might be in order.  There are a couple of reasons:  1. I am very angry about it, and it is hard for me to adequately express my anger and still stay lucid and coherent.  This is doubly true when I am as busy as I have been.  I do not have the time to sit down and focus on the problem to the extent necessary to make my thoughts readable.  I have been working on a post about my anger for months - my general anger, the big anger that has never left me once since 9/11 - and this is unusual for me, since I usually just tap something out quickly and post it.  You're lucky if I run a spell check.  I have not posted it yet, though, because though I have been working on it for a while, I just can never quite get the words right.  Perhaps one day I will be able to present it.  2.  I am going through a down period at the moment - missing my family, fed up and unhappy with school, general summer blah-ness - and I just don't think that I can handle focusing too much on it right now at the moment.  Just thinking about it makes me want to give up on this world completely, with all the things that are wrong with it.  This makes me very selfish I know, but it is the way I have to be to survive.  Perhaps some day I can come back and look at this.  I felt like a heel out enjoying myself with my family this past week, thinking about this man's life hanging in the balance and then hearing that it was abruptly ending.  Life goes on, I know, but it is harder for someone like me, who gets caught up in the little things of life that the big ones often seem unbearable.  Seeing the graphic pictures on Drudge made me burst into tears.  It makes me wonder whether all of this is worth the bother, even though I know it is.  Robert, the Expat Yank,  urlLink sums it up best :   I can't be the only one who REALLY would like to drop an atomic bomb on someone, tonight . . .  Oh, well . . . you know I don't mean that. I know I don't, too. We never mean that.   And that's the difference between us -- and them. That's what makes us better than them. Never forget that.   I have not forgotten, not completely.  Though it does help to be reminded.

      I will try to do little snippets throughout the week on the fun stuff I did last week.  Today, I will talk about the Mets game I saw on Friday night.  Things did not start out well.  I was kind of upset because I really didn't want to go.  My sister had asked me if I wanted to, and I told her not to buy me a ticket because I wasn't sure, but she went ahead and did it anyway, so I felt kind of obligated.  But once we started out there on the 7 train, my mood started to lighten a bit.  We got there very quickly, and it was fun getting to ride above ground and see the stadium coming up on our left.    Once we got there, things got even better.  We found out that Tom Glavine was going to be pitching, which was good news for those of us who are/were fans of his former team, the Atlanta Braves.  I am a fan not so much because he used to play for the Braves, but because he is hot.  We were right next to the bullpen, so we got to see him warming up before the game (but not before a slight bit of rain threatened our good time) and he even threw the ball that he'd been using to warm up with up to us.  It is now in my possession.  It would only be better if they'd stuck around to have him sign it, but hey, having an official Major League baseball that had been used by Glavine is cool enough.   It was Mike Piazza night, and since he'd just made the recordbooks for the most home runs by a catcher, and there were all these really great catchers who are also on the list there to help commemorate the moment - Carlton Fisk, Johnny Bench, Yogi Berra, and Gary Carter.  Tommy Lasorda was also on hand.  He got a new truck, and loads of other prizes, and it was pretty cool to be there for it.  We also got to sit next to this guy who was pretty cool - he goes to a lot of games, and makes lots of signs to hold up during the game when good Met things happen.  He also had a lot of cool buttons on his hat.  Overall it was a very cool experience, and it made me glad I had not forsaken the trip to accompany my grandmother to the theater.   The game itself was pretty exciting as well.  Glavine was less than stellar in his pitching, and the Tigers took a 2-0 lead fairly early.  But then Glavine drove in two runs to tie the game.  The one bummer was that since one in our group had to leave early - and he was too young to go it on his own - I was the lucky one who got to leave early with him.  He probably would have been fine on his own, but I had volunteered, and I knew that it would be my fault if something happened to him, so up we got at around 9:20 or so.  Anyway, we missed the best part of the game, when in the bottom of the 9th, with two outs, game still tied, Mike Cameron hit a home run to win the game for the Mets.  But it just so happened I was on the phone with my Dad (who was still at the game) at the exact second it happened, so it sort of felt like I was there.  I am very sorry I missed it, especially given the reason I had to come back into the city early - but that is a subject for another day.  Next time...I take some of the family to see  Assassins , and it doesn't turn out as badly as I'd imagined it would.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  Until then...

      Well, the family's gone.  Or they will be very soon.  And I was too tired and worn out and blistered to join them.  Though now that I am sitting here, all alone, I wish more than anything else that I'd gone with them, even though they were going to Chinatown.  I would try to go and join them, but I have no way to contact them and absolutely no way of finding them.  Perhaps I will just go back to their hotel and try to catch them before they leave.  But then I'll only leave feeling all depressed again, like I do now, and I don't think I could go through that again.    It's very tough to live so far away from my family, which makes it tough to think about staying in New York.  But, sometimes, it is just as tough to think about leaving New York.  Of course, I'm not going anywhere yet, so it's all academic at this point.    I have things to do the rest of the weekend, to make up for all the time that I spent with my family.  So probably no more blogging after this, unless something strikes my fancy.  And perhaps I will update at some point to provide a breakdown of all the fun I've had.  But today is not the day for that.  Right now, I am just too sad and depressed.

      Okay, so the whole Black family is probably just arriving in NYC as I type this, so I figured, since I know you all care so much, I'd update you on my plans.   Today - A little post-class meet-up with the fam.  They are all going to the ballet, while I wallow in the depths of Criminal Procedure.  But I will be meeting up with them afterwards at their hotel, just to say hi.  Wednesday - Meet Grandma, sister and her new fiance (I say this not to indicate that there is an old fiance floating around somewhere, but merely to indicate that this is relatively newly fianced) for a little TKTS action in the morning.  Pretty much looking for whatever is available, though I kind of want to drag them to see  Assassins , even though I've no hope that any of them would either like or appreciate it.  But they'll be better than all the other old folks that usually attend the matinees, so I think it'll be OK.  Or we'll just go see something else.  Sigh.  Then, it's skipping class and going off to the ballet again.  American Ballet Theatre doing Swan Lake.  Yawn.  But I've never seen a full version of it live, so it should be educational, if nothing else.  And not nearly as boring as Administrative Law.  Thursday - Hopefully, lunch with the whole fam (and fiance, of course - but since he's very nearly family already, he's included) and Christina (heck, who am I kidding, she's family too, since most of my family is more excited about potentially getting to see her than they are about getting to see me) someplace fun.  This will work out because I want it to, and will bend everyone to my will.  Then, that night, probably skipping class again (I know, I know, you're silently thinking to yourself that I'm a lazy student - and you would be right) to go see Movin' Out.  I've been wanting to see it for a while.  The kicker is that I actually know someone in the show, and since the lead dancer guy got hurt, the guy I know is filling in for him.  So I really don't want to miss it, so I think it's going to be bye-bye to Criminal Procedure.    Friday - Not sure what's on the agenda, besides a Mets game.  I've never been to Shea, and any team is better than the Yankees, so it should be fun.  Saturday - The fam leaves and my life returns to a state of semi-normalcy, i.e. boring.  Aren't you glad you got to read all of that?

      I think I am going to sue the Weather Channel for misrepresentation.  Everyday they tell me it is going to rain, so I carry my umbrella with me, only to make it through the whole day with nary a drop falling from the sky.  Doesn't the Weather Channel know that I've had three umbrellas in the past two weeks, and that every day I carry it with me, I risk losing the present one and having to buy another?  It's a risk I'm willing to take if it is actually going to rain, but if it's not...  As an aside, I'm sure I'd know why I don't have a cause of action against the Weather Channel for misrepresentation if I'd only learned anything in Torts II.  But alas, I did not...  Having said all of that, and even though I did bring my umbrella with me, I'm going to have to go knock on wood, since I don't actually want it to rain.  At least not right now when I am about to depart the building and walk up to Union Turnpike for lunch.  It can rain later, once I'm back inside for the duration of the day.  Okay, enough with the mindless chatter...it's food time.

       urlLink Andrew Sullivan  links to a  urlLink great piece by Lawrence Kaplan in The New Republic , where he bemoans the new rise of realism in American foreign policy:   The new realism, moreover, has already been enshrined in official policy. The Bush team still employs high-minded rhetoric about America's democratic mission abroad, but, in practice, it has reverted to a more humble focus. The Kerry campaign, too, has abandoned any pretense of democratic idealism. Strategic chokepoints, oil wells, alliances--these are the things that animate Kerry's "realistic" vision of the world. Which is too bad. Because, no matter what you think of Iraq, realism can't win the war on terrorism.   He then goes on to confirm my worst fears about what a Kerry Presidency might mean for the war on terrorism:   In April, Kerry said the goal in the present war should be "a stable Iraq, not whether or not [Iraq] is a full democracy."    This is almost nothing in and of itself, except a poorly worded (or I guess well-worded, depending on whether Kerry was going for clarity or not) statement.  Of course full democracy is not the goal, as there is not a full democracy - reading "full" to mean "pure" - anywhere in the world that I know of.  Some republican influences on the democratic form are to be expected.  But Kaplan goes on:   When it comes to Egypt, Kerry said in a recent interview, democracy promotion would have to take a backseat to "general stability in the Middle East." In China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Pakistan, too, "Kerry indicated that as president he would play down the promotion of democracy," according to the Post. After all, Kerry said, in an echo of Jeane Kirkpatrick's famous argument that the United States shouldn't push too hard to democratize "friendly" dictatorships, "You have to put your priorities first."    In all fairness to Kerry, I'm not sure that Bush currently plans to pursue a goal of bringing democracy to the world, one government at a time.  Or if that is his goal, he has not been the best at articulating it or making it the forefront of his justifications for war.  But after reading this article, I can't help but think that this is understandable, since apparently "talking the talk" is not very politically acceptable right now.  I'd give a slight edge to Bush, as he is at least somewhat committed to "walking the walk" in a way that Kerry has not shown thus far.  Continuing:   Yet, when approached by democracy and human rights advocates about having Kerry devote an address to the subject during his recent series of speeches on national security, the campaign declined. Asked to explain the lack of any references to the topic in Kerry's recent addresses, one adviser says, "He doesn't want to sound too 'soft,' and, my guess is, he doesn't feel passionately about it."    Is Kerry so out of touch that he thinks talking about supporting democracy, and advocating bringing it to the rest of the world, makes him sound too  soft ?  I guess  urlLink we have different ideas of what makes a Presidential candidate look soft .  To be fair, yet again, Kaplan doesn't provide much reason for us to be optimistic of Bush's motives either:   Trouble is, the very realists whom Bush decries are now running his foreign policy. The Pentagon's neoconservative democratizers have been losing influence for months now. The nadir came three weeks ago, when the National Security Council (NSC) signed off on a raid on the home of former Pentagon favorite Ahmed Chalabi--without informing the Pentagon beforehand. The neoconservatives' decline was already apparent last October, when, in an attempt to centralize Iraq policy at the NSC, Condoleezza Rice formed the Iraq Stabilization Group--again, without consulting the Pentagon. The official chosen to chair the group, Rice's boss in the first Bush administration, Robert Blackwill, has "reduced the Defense Department's influence to zero," says a senior administration official.   But this piece is not about advocacy of a candidate, but about advocacy of an idea:   But the United States is entitled--on September 11, the aim of a democratic Middle East became a matter of our national well-being, even survival. And the United States is obligated--because either pressure for democracy in the Arab world will come from the United States or it will come from nowhere at all.    And the oh-so-right conclusion:   To be sure, with Iraqis killing Americans every day, the temptation to yield to such pessimism may prove irresistible. But, when they advertise Iraq--like they advertised Vietnam before it--as the repudiation of a larger democratic war of ideas, the realists encourage a more pessimistic conclusion than circumstances justify. A policy can be measured by its successes, and it can be measured by its failures. When it comes to America's record in promoting democratic change, the former surely outweigh the latter. The world may not change easily, but, because of America, it has changed. Having come so far, and confronted with a new totalitarian threat, how "realistic" would it be to quit now?    I think this is a must read for all.  Really, go and check the whole thing out, especially if you are like me and need a little bucking up every now and again.  I start to think that I am crazy to feel the way I do - and then I read something like this by someone far more knowledgable and brilliant than I and realize that I am not.  Or at the very least, I am in very good company.

      I really think God is trying to tell me to go and see this show again.   I submit to you the evidence:  On Wednesday - ironically, the same day that my friend and her friend were going to see it without me because of the pile of work I had to do (boo for work!) - I found the following passage while dutifully doing my Administrative Law reading for my evening class:   President James Garfield is reputed to have complained, "[e]very time I make an appointment I create nine enemies and one ingrate."  Then he was killed by a disappointed office-seeker.  Few stories about the civil service can compare.   Then, today, there is this gem from  urlLink Best of the Web :   For some reason, gratuitous Abu Ghraib references keep popping up in movie reviews. Maybe film critics wish their editors would allow them to review "adult" movies as well as normal ones.   The Dallas Morning News's critic manages to work Abu Ghraib into a review of "Garfield: The Movie," a PG-rated biopic: "At this point we're really rooting for Garfield to save Odie. But in the creepiest of the film's questionable turns, Garfield manages to get the electric collar fastened to the bad guy's neck. Then Garfield sends electrical currents charging through him. Yes, in a world where recent news about the torture of prisoners appalls, kids are supposed to cheer as the fellow writhes in agony. And then Garfield zaps him again."  Of course, the movie concludes unhappily for Garfield, who is fatally shot by a disgruntled job-seeker. Yeah, we know, we should have warned you a spoiler was coming, but we figured anyone who saw "Arthur" back in 1981 already knows how the prequel turns out.   This is not to mention that there's a  urlLink new movie about Samuel Byck .  Or that Amazon lists the  urlLink release date of the new cast recording as July 27 .  Anyway, folks, given the immense pressure that I am under to see the show again (and especially since I never told the world about it here - yes I am aware that in using the word "world" to describe my audience I have vastly shrunk the size of the world) by forces beyond my control, it would seem just plain wrong to resist.  So try I will - and hope that all those pesky Tony wins don't make it difficult to get tickets.

      Blogging may be light this week, as my family will be in town starting Tuesday, and between work, and class, and trying to hang with them, I may have little time for anything else.   A full report of fun times will follow their visit I'm sure...

      I know I've said a lot of controversial things on this blog...but nothing like this.  But I've absolutely believed it is true for a while, and rewatching  Stir of Echoes  today has only reaffirmed those beliefs and entrenched them more deeply than ever before.  If you haven't seen either movie, you'd be well advised to stop reading now, and go to the video store...  The first time I saw each movie, I had a rather different opinion.  The first time I saw  The Sixth Sense  - I'd been grudgingly dragged to see it by a friend of mine (speaking of which, Christopher Steele, if you ever happen to read this, drop me a line why don't you?) - I thought it was really good.  And I still think it is a fairly well made film.  I just also think that it isn't a movie that stands up very well after two or so viewings.  I'll admit the first time I saw it I didn't figure out the ending.  So the second time I watched it, it was kind of fun to see how the director structured the film so there was just enough information for you to figure it out, yet not enough to make it obvious, or even all that easy to detect for a more savvy filmgoer like myself.   My mother, by the way, figured it out about halfway through.  She sure is one smart lady.  But by the third time I had watched  The Sixth Sense , it annoyed me quite a bit.  Once you know what happens, and you know how its structured, the movie loses all of its fun, all of its appeal.  It's what I like to call a gimmick-film.   Memento  was another one - though it is a slightly better film than  The Sixth Sense  (and I'm not just saying this because I love Guy Pearce).  These films seem to solely exist for the purpose of being clever, and once you've witnessed the cleverness and been taken in by it, subsequent viewings serve only to annoy, and not to provoke thought or even to entertain.    Great art should sustain well, even get better, upon subsequent viewings.  Now, I am not calling  Stir of Echoes  great art.  It is certainly far from a perfect film.  There are things that don't make any sense, and there is not enough development of some of the plot lines.  Still, every time I watch this movie I find myself liking it more.  The first time I watched it, I thought it was OK, but no  Sixth Sense .  But the story and the film, for all its faults, does not fall apart upon subsequent viewings like  The Sixth Sense  does.  So it is for this main reason that I boldly pronounce that it is a better film.  Just so you all know that it isn't just my appreciation for the underappreciated Kevin Bacon that is driving this pronouncement.  There are other things that set it apart, and this is mainly a question of approach to the subject matter.  In  The Sixth Sense , the child must come to terms with the fact that he "sees dead people" and must graduate from the fear that they instill in him to understanding what they want and being able to help them.  In the end, he is nothing but a happy, fairly well-adjusted child who is contentedly coping with his burden.   Stir of Echoes , instead, presents us with a father and son, both of whom see the same ghost.  The father's involvement in the world of spirits is temporary, imposed upon him by a hypnotic episode.  The son's involvement is permanent.  So, after the scene when the father alleviates himself of the burden, by solving the mystery and setting the ghost free, the audience is lulled into believing that this film has a happy ending.  But the film ends on a rather somber, and to me, ultimately more realistic note, as the son sits in the back of his parents' car, listening to the voices of the dead coming at him from all around, unintelligible because of their sheer volume.  And he tries to shut them out, covering his ears with his hands.  This scene alone makes it a better movie.  It's almost  The Sixth Sense  in reverse.  In the beginning, the kid seems perfectly content to be visited by ghosts.  But at the end, it proves to be too much for him, as he hears the overwhelming cacophony of voices calling out for help.    But really, I just like watching  Stir of Echoes  so much more.  And I honestly can't say why...not really.  My attempts to explain it here are vain and not really satisfying, rather like ramming my head into the wall over and over again, something I've been getting really good at lately.  Here's my argument anyway - for what it's worth.

      Today I went to the annual Mississippi Picnic in Central Park.  I happened upon my knowledge of the picnic in a rather odd way.  One day, when I was still a student at NYU, I was sitting in the common area in the Cinema Studies Department, waiting for a friend, when this girl from one of my classes came and sat down next to me and started talking.  She was very friendly, and I learned that it was her first semester there (I'd already been there for a year) after having transferred in from elsewhere, like me.  She was complaining because she had to go some new students dinner or something that night, that her mother was making her go because she wanted her to make new friends.  She said something about her mom being from Mississippi.  This surprised me since most people that I'd met in New York thus far had barely heard of Mississippi, never mind having met someone from there.  I was so sick of hearing after I told people where I was from that they'd "never met anyone from Mississippi before."  So this was refreshing to say the least, as now I was looking at someone with actual family connections to my birth state.  We got to know each other better over the course of the year, and she eventually told me about the Picnic.  Of course, when I mentioned this radical and seemingly crazy idea to my family, they of course knew all about it and how it was a big deal and usually on the news back home and all.  Funny how they never mentioned it to me.  So, anyways, I've gone for the past three years now, though I haven't had quite as rewarding an experience as I had this year.  Last year it rained, for the first time in the entire history of the Picnic according to my friend.  Her parents are deeply involved in planning for the event, which brings together people originating from Mississippi who now live in the tri-state area and beyond as well as visitors from back home and friends of friends with no other connection to Mississippi at all save the one that brung them.   So today I went and basked in the sun and ate lots of yummy fried chicken and awesome banana pudding.  And I got to visit with Logan and get caught up with her, which was nice since I hadn't talked to her in such a long time.  Because of the rain last year, I didn't get to see her for very long and I hadn't seen her since.  Even though I couldn't stay as long as I would have liked, it was nice to get to spend some time out of doors, in the Park, and hearing lots of people speak in my native tongue - or at least my native accent.    If I'm still here next year, I'll definitely be there again, and I'll try to plan ahead so I can spend more time and get the full experience.  And even if I'm not here, perhaps I'll make a special trip for the occasion.

      I noticed that with Blogger comments non-Blogger users would have to post anonymously...or at least that's what it seemed like to me.  So the Haloscan comments are back.   If only I were more decisive...

      I've decided to switch over to Blogger's internal commenting service rather than using Haloscan.  So I'm sorry everyone's comments have disappeared (I know, I know, you're thinking "what comments? there were only two or so"), but rest assured I did read them all, and I appreciate...as always...the comments.  It's nice to learn what you guys think about the blog, and me, and life.  It's also nice to be reassured in my darkest moments that I am not, indeed, insane.   So many thanks to all who read and visit this blog.  This venture is at times my own personal sounding board, my own personal anger management device, and my own personal shrink.   Here's hoping the new comments work well...and that they induce more submissions.

      Now that both  urlLink Lawren  and  urlLink Gail  have posted the same link, I can no longer ignore it.  So here it is:   urlLink 10 foods you should never eat .  It will be very hard to give up the Entenmann's Rich Frosted Donuts, even after reading this.:   How can one doughnut have as much artery-clogging saturated and  trans  fat (10 grams) as nine strips of bacon? That’s what happens when you completely cover a doughnut in chocolate. Try Entenmann’s Light Donuts instead. With anywhere from six to nine grams of fat per doughnut (no more than three of them saturated), they’re not health foods. But if you’ve got to have a doughnut, they’re a lot better than the regular version.   I really, really like them.  In fact, I feel like going out to buy some right now.  I'll try to restrain myself though.  Or maybe I'll just go buy some McDonald's fries, since according to the list, they are better for you than Burger King's.    Umm...fries.

      John McCain has said " urlLink no dice" to John Kerry's offers to dance :   Kerry has asked McCain as recently as late last month to consider becoming his running mate, but the Arizona senator said he's not interested, said a Democratic official who spoke on condition of anonymity because Kerry has insisted that his deliberations be kept private. A second official familiar with the conversations confirmed the account, and said the Arizona senator made it clear he won't change his mind.   Sorry, on second thought, it seems my use of the word "offer" is wrong:   Both officials said Kerry stopped short of offering McCain the job, sparing himself an outright rejection that would make his eventual running mate look like a second choice.  ``Senator McCain categorically states that he has not been offered the vice presidency by any one,'' said McCain's chief of staff, Mark Salter, who would not confirm the officials' account.   Of course, now that it is all over the news, and people have been speculating about it (with many dreaming that it might come true) for months, and now that we have had confirmation that Kerry was indeed open to such a proposition, I fail to see whether or not an actual "offer" was made is going to make a difference to whoever gets the job.  Not that he or she should mind being second choice, or even fifth choice, and at the very least, he or she should be consoled by being just a heartbeat away from the Presidency.  Now I don't like to toot my own horn, but I do have just three more words to add:   urlLink told you so .

      As far as I'm concerned, this day of frustration has been enough.  So I think the blog changes are done for now.  I think I like it better, though I may still play around with the font size a little bit.  I'm glad I've changed it, but I don't think it'll be happening again any time soon - judging from the headache I have - so hope everyone is happy with the new look.  This would all be a lot better if I had a slightly-more-than-rudimentary understanding of HTML.  Sigh.  I guess I'll have to add it to the list of things I need to learn.

      As you can see, the new blog changes are underway.  I am having trouble getting the buttons I have to add to line up in the way I want them too.  But I do not have the patience to try and figure it out right now, so I'm going to take a break.  Still have gotten nothing useful (aside from this) done today.  Where, or where does all the lost time go?

      I think I may try to tinker a little bit with the format of my blog over the next couple of days.  I'm getting kind of bored with it, and it looks like blogger has some cool new templates that they didn't have when I signed up.  Anyway, so if my links to blogs or other sites disappear at any point, this is why, and never fear, for they shall return soon enough.  I have a busy weekend planned (including, barring inclement weather, the Mississippi Picnic in Central Park on Saturday) as I have to get as much done as possible, since my family is going to be in town next week visiting, and I'll want to get to see them at least a little.  Anyway, all this is to say that the blogging may be light, but now that I'm back on the horse, there's no keeping me down for long.  In other words, I'll be back.

      Debbye over at  urlLink Being American in Toronto, Ontario , has made a similar point to  urlLink one I made the other day , only her post is  urlLink much more succinct, not to mention humorous :   CNN (actually, Wolf Blitzer) maintained a respectful silence during yesteday's observances, but as I was leaving they were starting up with that all too familiar phrase "Reagan led the country to the right" which is guaranteed to get my engines fired up (and this is despite the fact that he didn't lead me to the right until I saw the hostages disembarking and the Berlin Wall being busted up. So I'm a slow learner ...)    Do the morons in Old Media suppose that when Reagan was elected in 1980 (and re-elected in 1984) that voters didn't know he was a conservative? We don't elect people to lead us anywhere; we vote to inform those who would lead us as to what we want and heaven help them if they don't deliver.  The US electorate chose a conservative candidate because they approved of fiscal responsibility, a strong defense and had no intention of losing the Cold War.  The voters of the USA led the nation to the right, not Ronald Reagan. Sorry to bust your delusions, CNN, but there is help: try enrolling in a remedial Civic course.   There is one difference, of course:  I was complaining about the left, and she is complaining about the media.  But that is such a negligible difference that it nearly amounts to a non-difference.  And while I'm not one to buy into conspiracies, of either the left wing or right wing variety, the story I read that got my dander up was  urlLink this one , from none other than CNN.    Coincidence?

      Since I'm working on campus this summer, I spend a lot of time in the library doing research, looking up and reading articles, and this requires some level of concentration.  But not as much concentration as it takes to study for the bar exam.  Not that you could tell this from the state of things in the St. John's Law Library.  Now I understand that the recent law school graduates (and in defense of my school, not all of the students making use of the library to study for the bar are in fact students recently departed from St. John's, as anyone can take the bar review course here and study in the library) may have something less than respect for the rules and regulations governing library conduct.  This is evidenced by the number of cell phones I have heard going off just since I began to type this, not to mention the hurried gathering and chattering amongst fellows.  But even if they aren't interested in taking the rules seriously, or even in being curteous toward their fellow library inhabitants, you'd think that fear of the bar exam would force them to take more interest in studying than in talking incessantly to their significant others on the phone.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised, since it is always like this at finals time as well, but I figured that the increase in the difficulty of the exam, not to mention the increase in the seriousness of acheiving a passing score, might just evince a change in the atmosphere around here.   I guess I was wrong.  I can tolerate a certain irreverance for the rules, just as I can tolerate almost anything, so long as it is in moderation.  But people, let's get one thing straight.  This is a library, not Romper Room.  I don't mind hearing the occassional whispers, or even quiet talking to the person next to or across from you.  I engage in such activity myself.  If I wanted total silence in all things, there are places in the library I could go.  But even in the most "liberal" sections of the library, some modes of decorum and respect must and should still be observed.  If someone could talk quietly on their cell phone, I might not be so offended.  But the rule that requires everyone to shout into the phone makes using a cell phone in the library a most inappropriate action.  Since you're obviously not studying anyway, you might as well pick yourself up from your chair and proceed to the nearest area where it is permissible to speak on one.  I can only guess that the same laziness that is preventing you from studying also stymies your efforts to extract yourself from your chair and take the long journey across the stacks to the nearest stairwell or exit.  One wonders how you muster up the energy to drive all the way here and sit through the bar review class without requiring life-support or an oxygen tank.  Guess I'd better get back to work now...while it's relatively quiet in here.

      I promise I won't dwell on this, but the good folks over at  urlLink The Leaky Cauldron  have posted a  urlLink transcript of Alfonso Cuaron's appearance on FOXNews today  which contains the following exchange between the Prisoner of Azkaban director and an audience member:   Audience Member: I noticed, um, there was lots of foreshadowing in the third book that kind of leads to the fourth book and explains it a little better and I noticed that it was kind of left out. Particularly at the end of the third movie and I was curious if that was deliberate, or like how the fourth movie will be, especially because there's going to be a new director.  AC: Well, yeah, what happened is that you have to discriminate a lot when you are doing an adaptation. And we decided to just adapt everything that was relevant to the theme of a kid growing into a teenager. And pretty much we had to leave everything else, whatever didn't stick to that theme, we had to let it go. And that was one of those things. And yes, I know, it's setting up for the fourth one, but in the fourth one they are taking elements of the third to do the set up for the fourth.   I find the question to be odd, because I thought that of the many things left out of the movie, this was not one of the problem areas.  I mean, the most important bit of foreshadowing from the book, i.e. Professor Trelawney's prediction, actually remains in the book.  Now, those of you who have a clue what I'm talking about will note that this is actually a prediction of the end of the third book, but it is directly relevant to the fourth and is referenced therein.    I also find it odd that some things left out of the third one will be added to the fourth one, since it is a much longer book and as such there is going to be even more trouble fitting everything in.  Though, honestly, as the fourth is my least favorite, I say snip away at the story.  There are parts of it that I want to skip when reading it.  I guess my only qualm here is that, again (not to beat a dead horse) the movie went way too fast and things were unnecessarily left out.  Ultimately, I guess I disagree with the theme that Cuaron chose to focus on for the film, that of Harry's turning into a teenager.  I think that this is indeed an important theme in the book, but I do not think that it is the most important one.  If anything, this is a more important part of the later books, and I hope that those films do not end up going the same route.    But then again, what do I know about it?  I'm a law student, not a film director.

      When I signed on to AIM this afternoon, I was confronted with that annoying window that always opens containing news headlines and dumb entertainment and game links.  Today, the main news headline read as follows:   Breaking News:  Some Still Angry at Reagan.   There are so many things wrong with this.  First of all, duh.  Of course there are still people angry at Reagan.  I'm sure the same will be said upon the death of every ex-President, as those involved in politics are likely to draw the wrath of at least half of the country.  This is doubly true when you are the most visible politician of your nation, and the most visible representative of your nation's political character to the communities of the world.  It is even more true for someone like Reagan, who spoke what he felt to be the truth, no matter what and without much regard to how others might feel about it, for someone who felt there were more important things to a political identity than polling data.  But this headline fails to articulate with any specificity exactly why people are so angry with Reagan and his legacy.   Clicking on the headline and then the article to which it refers, one arrives  urlLink here , to an article that mainly focuses on Reagan's dealings with the AIDS crisis that unfolded during the course of his Presidency, but also talks of his many other purported sins, one of which is, oddly enough, signaling and starting the rise of conservatism in Washington:   Bruce Cain, a political analyst at the University of California, Berkeley, said Reagan singularly brought conservatism into the mainstream during his presidency, an orthodoxy that has made Democrats and liberals an enduring minority in Washington.   ``What made things worse for them is that he was an extremely influential figure, and his ideas had lasting impact,'' Cain said.    Oh, the horror.  There's nothing worse than them conservatives, is there?  And then there's this:   Reagan also dealt a blow to organized labor by firing the striking air traffic controllers, and appointed Antonin Scalia, still the Supreme Court's most conservative jurist.    Ack, how dare he appoint a brilliant conservative jurist to the Supreme Court.  What could he have been thinking?  News flash guys:  he was a conservative.  And he was also elected overwhelmingly to the Presidency...twice.  You can qualify this by saying that he just happened to be in the right place at the right time, or that his opponents were weak.  But the way some people talk, it sounds as if Reagan instigated a coup and then forced his views and his will upon an unsuspecting nation.  The debates about Reagan went on in his own time, and his detractors lost.  If you're looking for someone to blame, don't blame Reagan.  Blame the voters.  Then there's the obligatory "other side of the story" paragraph:   Critics give Reagan grudging credit for his ability to connect with working-class voters, who would come to be known as Reagan Democrats. He also galvanized conservative Christians to participate in the political process - even while putting some of their more prized goals on the back burner, like restricting abortion rights or restoring prayer in public school.    But they quickly bring it back to "reality" and finish up with a bang:   In the end, critics say Reagan's enduring legacy may be the generation of Republican leaders - including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, House Majority Leader Tom Delay, and to some extent George W. Bush - who came of age during his presidency and have pursued a conservative social agenda with even greater gusto. That, in turn, helped create the bitterly divided political environment that exists to this day.   ``The tone has gotten more venomous, largely because of the people who came after Reagan and carried the Reagan banner,'' said Roger Hickey, co-director of Campaign for America's Future, a liberal advocacy group. ``I give him full credit for unleashing the vast right-wing conspiracy.''    Right.  His most enduring legacy won't be, say, winning the Cold War or anything.  It won't be defying the expectations of those very critics by not launching us into nuclear oblivion and instead resolving the situation with peace and dignity.  Instead, it'll be spawning the rise of conservatism and giving us the likes of Tom Delay.    I suspect that either way, he'd take the credit, and be proud to take it (well, perhaps all except the Tom Delay part - I cannot quite reconcile Reagan's firm but civil tone with Delay's brutal and uncivil one).  But I just as easily come to the conclusion that this analysis is wrong.  I will not debunk all of the claims made against him in the article.  There are other people with much more knowledge and much more skill to do so than me.  For one example, see  urlLink Andrew Sullivan on Reagan's response to the AIDS crisis  (and really on everything else related to Reagan - skim the whole blog for mentions), where he not so much debunks but clarifies.  I would never argue that Reagan was perfect, or that he didn't make mistakes.  Of course he made mistakes.  He was just a human being like everyone else in this world.  None of our President's have been perfect.  And none ever will be, even if the machines one day take over the job.   But my main beef with this article is that it seeks to blame, or more accurately quotes those who seek to blame, Reagan for the current brand of conservatism on display in the Republican party.   But, again, Reagan was only one man, and I'd argue that he was less the cause and more the response to it.  The 60s and 70s, and the events that transpired, with social liberalization and the constitutionalization of abortion, as well as a whole other host of political issues, is what gave rise to modern social conservatism.   If liberals want to see the true cause of the rise of conservatism as it is today in the United States, they need only look within.  And I do not say this in a bad way.  But whenever there is a popular political movement, one opposed to it quickly rises to meet it, and will often surpass it.  I think we may be on the brink of it swinging back the other way, if Republicans are not careful.  These things are cyclical, and if anything, liberals should take it as a great compliment to the power of their movement that such a strong response rose to meet it.  The problem now is that they keep looking backward, and it is this that will keep them from regaining power, if anything can.    So if you're unhappy with the state of the union today, don't look back to blame Reagan.  Look ahead and try to do something to change it.

      Disgusted with my  urlLink trip to the movies on Saturday  (I must reiterate that  The Day after Tomorrow  is not worth seeing, so just don't - EVER), and throughly unenchanted with my Administrative Law reading, on Sunday I braved the lines to go and see  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .  The good news is the film was playing right around the corner, so I didn't go too far out of my way.  Also, I've been to this theater often, but never seen a movie on the particular screen the film was showing on and I had no idea that they had a theater that big - the other ones are much smaller - and the movie was not sold out, so I had the comfort of having an empty seat on either side of me (go ahead and feel sorry for me if you will, having to see the movie all by myself) in case I got restless, which indeed I did.  After all of that, I must say that I was more than a little disappointed with what I saw.  And I'm conflicted about exactly why I was so disappointed.  Part of me wants to say that it was a good film in its own right, but not a very good adaptation.  But then I start to second guess that because even I was a little confused by what was going on in parts (because it moves so quickly and skips over things) and that's saying something as I've read the book twice in the past six months.  Then I start to wonder if I'm turning into a Potter purist, and that I just wanted to see everything from the book in the movie and when it wasn't all there, I became disgruntled.  It is my favorite book of the series after all, but I'm not sure I can (quite) say it's my favorite film of the series.   I'm not sure it bothers me so much that things were left out.  I am a realist and it is just not possible to include everything, and even if everything could be included time-wise, some things just don't translate well from the page to the screen.  It didn't bother me that many of the things depicted were basically the same as they were in the book, but changed just slightly - almost nothing in the film is exactly as it was in the book - by adding a character who isn't supposed to be there, or placing it in a different part of the timeline.  This is what adaptation is all about, and I think that - for the most part - it captured the spirit of the book nicely.  But there were ways in which it did not live up to this task.  Many things were left out completely, some of them vital (in my opinion) to the advancement of the story.  And many of them I feel were also unecessarily left out because they would have taken maybe a second or two to explain and wouldn't have added that much to the total running time.  Then there were some rather odd additions.  I will not go into detail, because those fans who might be reading this and haven't seen the movie yet will not be appreciative of having me spoil it all, and the rest of you couldn't care less and wouldn't know what I was talking about anyway.   Mostly, I think the pace was just too fast.  I think this was an overcompensation from the first two films, where the opposite problem arose.  I guess I'd just rather have a slower pace, especially for this film, because there was some wonderful cinematography and not nearly enough time to enjoy it, for fear that any turning of attention away from the action might lead to missing sometthing vital.  Perhaps I will have to see it again to see if it improves any.  It strikes me as odd that as the children get older, and as the content of the films gets more mature (as do the audiences), that the pace would actually speed up.  One would think the opposite would be the case.   That said, there is much here to love, especially by way of the performances.  Though again, one wonders why some of the juciest acting material was cut from the thing entirely.  Gary Oldman realized, and even surpassed, my expectations of him.  And David Thewlis, though he is not what I pictured the character to be when reading the book (oddly enough, since I knew he was going to be in it before I started reading), was pitch perfect.  As for Alan Rickman...nothing more needs to be said, though I could have stood with a sight more of him.  And all of them.  I think the child actors continue to improve, despite the pigeon-holing and one-note writing of their parts at times.   Anyway, while there was much to love, in the end, I left wanting more.  But I guess if I want more, I'll just have to suck it up and read the book again.  Or direct my own version using stick figures and cardboard backgrounds.  That'll get me to appreciate the original.

       urlLink Drudge  directs us to this  urlLink story from the New York Post's Page Six :   WHEN ABC News broke the sad news of Ronald Reagan's death Saturday afternoon, it sent its competitors into a frenzy. The press corps traveling with President Bush in Normandy first heard the news when ABC's White House reporter Terry Moran began doing a live report in their midst. The reaction, according to one eyewitness, was "total chaos — people running everywhere, knocking into things." CNN's John King yelled into his cellphone that CNN had been beaten and was so upset he threatened to quit. King ended his tan trum by throwing his cellphone to the ground. Bad move: his meltdown was captured on tape. So just how did ABC get such a big jump? The network refused comment, but insiders credit ABC News chief David Westin. Apparently, working the phones produces better results than throwing them.    I like the image of John King throwing his cell phone.  It reminds me of that scene from the movie Primary Colors, when the character who is supposed to be Clinton throws his cell phone out the window of a moving car.  They have to stop and go back for it, and when his wife proclaims that she has found it, he states emphatically that she never would have found it if he hadn't thrown it out the window.  Priceless.  The chaos thing also reminds me of the sheer insanity that happened with the Martha Stewart verdict.  The network I was watching actually got it wrong.  I guess the odd signals they were using to get message of the verdict out didn't work to well.  I don't remember which one I was watching.  Oh, wait,  urlLink yes I do .   I heard the news of Reagan's passing while sitting in Burger Heaven, semi-watching the Yankees game.  All of the sudden, I looked up at the screen, knowing that the game was still in the middle, and wondered why the fans were all standing and singing.  Then I realized, from the closed captioning, that they were singing God Bless America, and before I could wonder why, they flashed a picture of Ronald Reagan on the screen.  My friend, who is a liberal, found this a most unfortunate occurrence.  I just found it odd, until I remembered that I had seen a headline just that morning referring to Reagan's rapidly deteriorating health.  Both of us came to the conclusion at the same time that he must have died.  My friend graciously refrained from saying anything.  Murmurs rippled across the restaurant as the news passed, and people started pulling out their cell phones to confirm.  The manager switched the TV to CNN and turned the volume up.  I called my family but no one answered.    It is strange to recall in such detail.  There are only a handful of events in history where I can remember exactly what I was doing when they occurred.  Both of the deaths of Presidents during my cognizant lifetime are on the list.  I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when Nixon died as well.  It is amazing to me how one person can become so tied to the identity of a nation that when that person dies, it is as if a part of the nation dies with him.  It is a reminder that all of those from a different time are leaving us, one by one, and soon they will all be gone and we will be denied of their presence forever, or at least until we die ourselves.  It is a reminder, most of all, of the ultimate fragility of the state in which we live...as any state must be without a despotic and immortal leader.  And it should resolve us to make sure that the nation stays strong, that the bulk of it goes on, even if slightly battered and forever changed.

      I was a recent convert to the world of  24  this season, so I did not quite realize, until the past couple of weeks, when I have been watching the first two seasons on DVD, how incredibly unbelievable the plots of the show really were.  Given the current state of world affairs, where we have seen the impossible happen time and again, one is inclined to believe that almost any scenario is possible, and fiction can almost seem more realistic to us, possibility-wise, than the truth.    This is not the case with  24 .    I want everyone to know that I do not consider this to be a bad thing.  I was instantly hooked on the show when I started to watch it this season, even though I came into it late in the game and a lot of my knowledge of what was going on had to be picked up from various third persons, sypnoses on the web, and context clues (now there's a phrase I haven't used since elementary school) from the show itself.  I cannot wait until this past season also arrives on DVD so that I can watch it uninterrupted and experience all of it visually, as it was meant to be received.    I was even more instantly hooked on the first two seasons, and I experienced a feeling of suspense and engrossment, even though I knew a lot of the things that were going to happen, from having watched the show this season.  For a show that is so unrealistic in its depiction of events, and a show that any conspiracy theorist would just love, it is almost surprising how quickly one becomes engrossed.  I got so into some of the episodes that I would be screaming at the screen.  I think part of the suspense is that you already know what is going to happen - even if you haven't seen an episode, for there are things that happen on every show that are a given, and things that will never happen (though I can imagine that the season finales of both the first two seasons must have been nearly shocking to watch - indeed, I was shocked by the second season finale, even though I really shouldn't have been) - and it's just a matter of when and how, and since the show only takes place over twenty four hours, the writers can really drag out events and delay the gratification that comes from seeing your expectations realized on screen.    It is also one of the few television shows that I think might be much more fun to watch with a group of people than by yourself.  Normally, I do not approve of this type of activity as an ideal viewing situation, because invariably you get to talking with people about what is going to happen or what has already happened and you miss things that are going on.  That is not as much a danger here, and some of the things are so crazy that you want someone next to you so that you can turn and say "Oh my God!  I just don't believe it."  Or perhaps this is just my old complex about talking to my television coming back to haunt me.  Overall, I think it's a great show precisely because it is so unrealistic.  It is no wonder that this show has been a success whereas a show like  The Agency , which tried to be more straightforward, was a flop.  It's fun to watch, and it doesn't get you thinking about what might or could happen in reality, and any time it gets close to doing so, it blows back up into crazy tall tales and fantasy yet again.  And for a show that features a politician and President so prominently, it is surprisingly non-political.  And any time the show skirts politics, it quickly takes a backseat to the action and the mania of what is going on around it.  If you're unfamiliar with the show, do yourselves a favor and go and rent the first two seasons.  I thought I was a fan of the show before seeing them.  But now I am something closer to a fanatic.

      You may not hear me say many good things about John Kerry on this blog or in life.  But today will be an exception to the general rule,  urlLink for after reading this , I gained a little more respect for him:   Here at the University of Toledo on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Kerry bowed his head for a moment of silence in Mr. Reagan's honor and edited a tribute to the late president into his keynote speech at the commencement of Bedford High School in nearby Temperance, Mich.   Ignoring their obvious differences - Mr. Kerry's first flash in the Senate was leading the investigation into the Reagan administration over Iran-contra - the Democrat praised the Republican as a "modern giant" who provided "the voice of America in good times and in grief."   "Because of the way he led, he taught us that there was a difference between strong beliefs and bitter partisanship," Mr. Kerry told the 372 Bedford graduates and their friends and relatives. "He was our oldest president, ladies and gentlemen, but he made America young again."  Lauding Mr. Reagan's speech 20 years ago on the 40th anniversary of D-Day, as well as his leadership after the Challenger explosion, Mr. Kerry said the American spirit "wears no political label.''  "In service to others and yes, in sacrifice for our country, there are no Republicans; there are no Democrats; there are only Americans and patriots," Mr. Kerry told the class, which includes the largest number of Bedford graduates in a single class, 26, ever to enlist in the military.   These are thoughtful words, and poetic ones.  He has also postponed two large, star-studded fund raisers that had been scheduled for this week, possibly at great expense to his campaign.  He didn't need to do it this way and he did, and for that, I graciously give him the utmost credit.

      I don't have much to say on this, except that people seem to feel strongly about Reagan.  I have never met anyone who is indifferent about the man.  But some things everyone should be able to agree upon:  1.  For better or worse, Ronald Reagan was one of the most important and influential men to hold the office of President in the 20th Century.  I happen to think it was for the better.  Many disagree, and I suppose I could understand that.  But he served this country during some of the most important moments in history, and he is largely responsible for the state of the government today, though his rolling back of the sheer size of government has been curtailed slightly under Clinton and the current President Bush.    2.  Because of this, the occasion of his death means something.  It is the end of something, of someone who meant something very big to the country.  It is a moment to stop and reflect and to mourn, if so inclined.  He filled a space in this world with his giant presence, and his absence, though not sudden or even new, leaves a great void that must be acknowledged.    My personal thoughts are that this is a sad and momentous occasion.  I don't think there's anything in politics like him any more, or ever will be again, and I think we are the worse for it.

      I just got back from seeing this movie, and couldn't wait to post here to say how awful it is.  I should have braved the lines to see Harry Potter instead.  But my friend said he wanted to see it (he ended up hating it too), and it was playing at the Ziegfeld, so I figured what the heck - at least it should have some good special effects.  And it did.  Those did not disappoint.  I also guess I can't say that the rest of the movie did disappoint, because I wasn't particularly looking forward to seeing it or anything.  But I guess I just didn't expect it to be as bad a movie as it really was.  For once,  urlLink I must disagree with A.O. Scott .  I mean, I suppose it is possible that the badness of this film was intentional, even though it wasn't billed that way.  But if that is the case, then I suppose it would be unforgivable.  I thought the point of the film was to raise awareness and get people to take the threat of global warming seriously.  But this film is simply too ludicrous to be taken seriously.    Ironically, the most offensive political devices in the film were not what bothered me the most.  I did not know or expect it to be so specifically referential to current political figures, and while I found this annoying, it could have been easily forgiven had the movie been good.    I have no idea whether the science of it is accurate or not.  I suspect that if another ice age does come, it will not happen over a span of hours or days, but I leave that to the experts.  I do know a thing or two about film, and I can honestly say that this is not how to make one.  So if you're thinking about it, stop and just don't.  Not even the presence of Dennis Quaid can save this film - and that, folks, is really saying something.

      I'm out for a day of fun with an old friend from home.  Of course, it is  urlLink going to rain .  It seems like every time I have places to go and people to see, it rains, which sucks.    Since I'm going to be out, and I don't know when I'll be back, I'm going to have to try to find somewhere to watch the Belmont.  Shouldn't be too hard.  I'll even go so far as to step into a bar if I have to.  If there's going to be a Triple Crown winner, I want to be able to see it.  Even if not, it's still very exciting, horse racing.  I don't know how into it my friend is going to be though.  He wants to go to a museum.  Not a lot of TVs there, unless there part of some freaky post-modern art installation about the alienation of the human race or some such nonsense.  Maybe I'll bring along my portable radio, just in case.  Haven't seen the new Harry Potter yet, which sucks.  I really want to see it, but I guess it'll just have to wait until next weekend.  Might not be too bad then...probably be less crowded, and we all know how I feel about crowds (and if you didn't, now you do).    As an aside to all of you out there that I owe emails to - don't worry, I haven't forgotten about you.  I'm just very bad about remembering to email, and even worse about keeping in touch.  I always have been...it's like being caught in a vicious cycle:  when I think about replying to emails, I either don't feel like doing it or I don't have the time, and when I do feel like doing it, I am too busy.  That said, now that I've typed it here, it will be on my mind, and you will hear from me soon enough - if you're still speaking to me, that is.  Good weekends to all!

      Robert Tumminello, the very wise and very prolific blogger at  urlLink Expat Yank  has  urlLink this to say about a possible Kerry victory in November :   One scenario that cannot be overlooked is simply this: What if John Kerry wins?  Well, I suspect that  urlLink Tom  may decide to head to Crete permanently and cease communications with the outside world. And  urlLink Shannon  might pile up her law books and leap off.   Yes, folks, that is me he is talking about, as it is my blog he linked to.  I received a considerable amount of traffic (well, for me anyway, which isn't saying too terribly much), so I just want to allay any fears that I will try to do myself harm if Kerry wins.  Alas, even if I wanted to, I have sold a lot of my law books back to the bookstore, so I would be unable to execute such a plan.  Perhaps I will stop selling back and start stockpiling my books again, just in case.  I do still have all the ones the bookstore wouldn't take back becuase new editions have been published...  But I digress.  Robert goes on to offer some hope even in the face of a Kerry victory:   And of course, there are many others. All kidding aside, we have to be prepared. Take a deep breath and consider it: What if Kerry does win?   Well, the world will not come to an end -- at least not immediately.   Yes, I must admit that I feel much better now.  He goes on to make the anti-Kerry case, better than, and with much more authority, than I ever could:   Kerry's ducking, diving, "nuancing" and  urlLink insisting this is not a war  might appeal to some in the U.S. electorate, but the Islamist crowd is not voting (at least, not in large numbers) in a U.S. election. The enemy remain AT WAR WITH US, regardless of whether or not we -- as many of us seem weirdly determined to -- choose to cover our eyes, in the manner of a two year old playing peek-a-boo, in an attempt to make it all just go away. It won't.    I have to admit that at times I wish to succomb to this impulse as well.  There are times I almost find myself doing it, after watching the news for a long period of time, it all starts to seem so reasonably distant.  In the sight of recent setbacks and horrors, it makes one want to retreat even further, as I have been wont to do in recent days.  But ignoring it will not make it go away.  It is braver to stand up and fight, even if mistakes are made along the way - as mistakes will invariably be made, as no one is perfect and it follows that no nation can be perfect, and in fact is further from being perfect than any one individual because a nation is simply made up of many individuals with their imperfections compounded - than to curl up and admit defeat at the first sign of trouble or to pretend that it isn't happening at all.  Going back to the pre-9/11 mentality is absolutely the worst case scenario, and it is the most unacceptable position that any government, but especially this one, could possibly take.

      Well, I'm not back home very long, and already, I am seemingly creating enmity all around me.&nbsp; Though some of it did start before I left.  In one respect, I had a couple of great debates with one of my friends, who I cannot seem to convince that the United States owes the rest of the world something for being the world's only superpower, and that as the world is ever shrinking, we, along with the rest of the world, will benefit from our foreign policy decisions of late, fraught with mistakes though it may be.&nbsp; I think we have a great mandate, as well as a great responsibility, after September 11, to do something, to do everything that we can to make the world a better place, including freeing the Iraqis from Saddam.&nbsp; My friend thinks that since none of it impacts him directly (in one of his weaker arguments, he said "the terrorists didn't fly planes into me") and because there are so many problems at home that need our attention that we shouldn't be sticking our nose in where it doesn't belong and trying to solve the rest of the world's problems.&nbsp; I disagree with his premise because there is no reason that we can't do both, and it means less to me that I have government provided health care when I know that things are so much worse for nearly everyone else in the world.&nbsp; That, to me, is the real American arrogance, and I think the rest of the world is right to reprimand us when we are slow to take action.&nbsp; Still, this argument is better than Michael Moore's the-war-is-all-about-oil mantra, but I'll save that for another day, since I want to present all my thoughts on his film in one place, and here is not that place.  But just when I think I've found a place to fit in, I am surprised yet again.&nbsp; A friend of mine - who has apparently been captured by the religious right and held hostage - sent me an unsolicited email the other day trying to recruit me into the fight against gay marriage.&nbsp; It surprised me, and I don't quite know how I am going to respond to it yet.&nbsp; Now my parents are mad at me because I did not want to go to church, because I didn't want to run into her.&nbsp; I was afraid I couldn't help but respond with my disgust, and I didn't think church was the place to carry that out.&nbsp; But I do feel disgust.&nbsp; Not at her - or anyone elses - opposition to gay marriage.&nbsp; I think reasonable minds can differ.&nbsp; I do object to the rhetoric of the relgious right, though.&nbsp; These people should pay more mind to the tenets of their religion, which teaches them that we are all God's children and that it is not for us to judge here on earth, but for God to judge us on how we lived our lives once we are through with this world.&nbsp; I also object to the perversion of conservative principles that is embodied in this ridiculous attempt of Congress to continue dealing with this issue, when it is something that should more appropriately be dealt with by the states, not the federal government or, even worse, the United States Constitution.  All in all, it's been a frustrating couple of days for me.&nbsp; Still, it's nice to be home, and it's even nice to have a little debate or two, keeps the brain from shutting down.&nbsp; And my sister's engagement party yesterday was a big success, I think, though I haven't gotten the chance to spend very much time with her fiance yet.&nbsp; And her kittens are very cute, and no longer occupying my room.&nbsp;   So, it's the little things.

      I'm back, in oh so many ways.  I'm back home in Mississippi for two weeks.&nbsp; I thought it was hot in New York, but it's ten times worse today.&nbsp; Lying in bed this morning - I'm bunking with my mother because my sister and her kittens have taken over my room - listening to the too-loud radio, I heard that in New Orleans it is going to get up to 96 today, but that it will feel even hotter - well over 100.&nbsp; Of course, my sister is having her  outdoor  engagement party today, starting while the sun is still relatively high in the sky.&nbsp; Hopefully, I won't pass out or anything.  I'm back from the doldrums of law school life, able to be lazy and not feel guilty about it for a couple of weeks.  Lastly, I'm back to blogging.&nbsp; Sorry for my prolonged absence, but it is a difficult life I lead, at times, and it becomes impossible for me to do all the things I like and or want to do, especially those that require energy, since much of my free time is spent doing that which requires as little thought as possible.&nbsp;   Upcoming highlights:&nbsp; details of my adventures in flying, my review of  Farenheit 9/11,  random musings on the  Law & Order  universe, and much much more.&nbsp; I promise not to disappoint, 'cause now, I got nothin' but time.

      I haven't posted in a while, I know, but  urlLink this one  really dragged me out of my hole.&nbsp; Here's Martha Stewart, on going to prison: &nbsp;  "I could do it,'' she said, according to excerpts released by ABC late Friday. ``I'm a really good camper. I can sleep on the ground. There are many, many good people who have gone to prison. Look at Nelson Mandela.''   &nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; Puh-leeze.&nbsp; She deserves every bit of her sentence just for saying something like that.&nbsp; To even compare her situation to that of Mandela is insulting to...well, everyone.&nbsp; Get a grip, lady. &nbsp; In other news, I am busily studying for finals.&nbsp; But good things will follow that, I know, so stay tuned.&nbsp; Or, more accurately, come back in about a week. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      The good thing about summer classes is that they go by rather quickly.  Unfortunately, this is also one of the bad things.  In other words, before the semester started, it seemed nice that it would be over before I knew it.  Now that exams are looming on the horizon, only two weeks away, and I am behind and have lots to get done, I'm wishing that I'd had more time, or had at least applied the time I did have better.  Of course, when the two weeks are over, I'll be back to being glad it was short and sweet.  Or maybe short, but a little on the bitter side.  All of this is to say that if it seems as if I've disappeared over the past couple of weeks, it'll just be like all the other times when I've been too busy for words.  It will not signal my demise, or my fall from grace in the blogging world.  I'll try not to disappear completely, but just in case I do, I shall return.  Never fear.

      Well, that's all I wanted to say really.  Hope everyone enjoys the day, whatever their plans might be.   I have nothing special planned.  I might meet up with some people later to go check out some fireworks.  But other than that, I'm just sitting around, doing some work, listening to the Yankees/Mets game on the radio - GO METS!  The game yesterday was awesome, by the way, back and forth, never boring, won by the Mets in the bottom of the 9th.    Take care all, and if you have a long weekend, like I do, then by all means enjoy it.  I'll leave you with my thoughts on the anneversary of the birth of our nation.  Well, it's my nation anyway, though it dawns on me that anyone from around the world might be reading this, many of you not American.  I've been in school so long that you'd think all the optimism I feel about this country would have been drilled and beaten and drained from me by skeptical and cynical professors, but my love of this country has grown even more, if for no other reason than in resistance and defiance of those self-same cynics.  This country is far from perfect.  It has things in its past - most notably slavery, though that is hardly our only transgression - that are particularly shameworthy, things that no one but a cold and heartless and evil soul could look back upon with any pride.  But this nation has survived so much, and has done so largely in tact, in the same form in which it began.  This nation may not be as old as most in the world, but it has endured in a stable form.  The Constitution of the United States has been in effect since 1789, and it has only been amended 27 times (really, you could make that 17, since the first ten came so quickly that they have almost always been a part of the Constitution itself, and they were things that many people advocated making part of the Constitution proper) in that time.  Moreover, its authority as the supreme law of the land has never been seriously challenged.  Even that most defiant of former Presidents, Richard Nixon, bended before its will when the Constitution was interpreted by the Supreme Court as not protecting under executive privilege tapes related to a criminal investigation.  All of this is to say that there is something to admire about American, and Americans, who are able to adapt to changes and circumstance, and were even able to survive the Civil War.  There's a line in the film Amistad (a wonderful movie that everyone should see) when Anthony Hopkins, playing former President John Quincy Adams, comments that the inevitable Civil War (the events take place roughly 20 years before the Civil War started) will be the "last battle of the American Revolution."  I think that the sentiment is partially correct - the Civil War was indeed fought, in part, to correct one of the glaring oversights and mistakes of the Revolution, namely that the fight should have been for the freedom of all Americans.    At the same time, though, this sentiment is wrong.  I think it is more wrong that right.  For we are still engaged in this battle, on many fronts.  And we will be as long as the nation is in existence.  But this is not a reason for pessimism.  The struggle for perfection, of constantly reaching for it, even if you never quite make it, even if you know it is impossible to acheive, is a noble endeavor.  And it is one that Americans have been engaged in since the beginning.  And it is one, I think, that will never end.

      Apparently,  urlLink several U.S. representatives , in a fit of insanity, have requested the presence of...wait for it...United Nations officials to "observe" the 2004 Presidential election on November 2:   The lawmakers said in the letter that in a report released in June 2001, the US Commission on Civil Rights "found that the electoral process in Florida resulted in the denial of the right to vote for countless persons."   The bipartisan commission, they stressed, determined "that the 'disenfranchisement of Florida's voters fell most harshly on the shoulders of black voters' and in poor counties." Both groups vote predominantly Democratic in US elections.   The commission also concluded, the lawmakers added, that "despite promised nationwide reforms (of the voting system) ... adequate steps have not been taken to ensure that a similar situation will not arise in 2004 that arose in 2000."   Even if all of these things are true, the presence of the U.N. is hardly likely to help matters.  They're only likely to amke it worse by setting up some kind of directive or standard or demand and then not following up upon it, not enforcing it, and decrying others who try to see that the aims are met.    This is what they did in Iraq, after all, is it not?
