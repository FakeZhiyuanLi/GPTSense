      Selfishness. A word that never really got into my head. What is selfishness, can somebody tell me? yes i really can't make head or tail of this thing. When someone calls me selfish i go crazy, if that person is somebody for whom i have done ething possible, gone out of all limits to help him.(It's a him,,,, hehe ...yes such a someone exists). Do ething posisble and then u ask for a small favour, or u expect that person to help u ,,, then u become selfish? Isn't he selfish then, in calling me selfish , not being ready to help at all? This is what i can't understand about being selfish. And every time this happens i decide, no more helping anyone. I should learn to say no... but i never learn. Can someone teach me that also. Ok for that don't pour on me advise that u should learn thigns in life on ur own... letme be selfish from now on( Maybe he will say as if u were not till now)...weird isn't it.

      ok so y does this happen...or i feel nothing happens... always runs into a stagnancy. How can anything run to become stagnant, i don't know but when u think u'll get what u hope for, u rush things just to end up in a no escape no change blank point. yes back to square one ,,, life's stagnant.  But do i say so because all that's happening around me, right in front of me ... no actually it's all thats happenign to my life,,,to me...every thing is going exactly opposite of what i want or what i had hoped for. Have all these made me frozen,,, or is it that am already frozen at mind to even accept that these are happening to me. But one thing a frozen mind is all that u need now... ??Now, that reminds me , people say live in the now, power of now... i can't even believe in the now. y do i think so much,,, what next?that question doesn't frighten me,it just kills meeee....My so called frozen mind still throws that quest to me every now n then sending a chill down my spine....am scared i accept (at least that, rest nothing i accept). But what am i scared of .... of nothing ,,,yes am scared exactly of that ,.., the feeling of having nothing , the loss of belonging . No more feelings , nothing can get to me.. all's there at a distance ...the distance that my frozen mind has created. Then y do i again think of what's next?????  Maybe i should just stop thinking, but again i can't.
