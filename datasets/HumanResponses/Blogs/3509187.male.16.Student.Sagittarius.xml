						   Hey... I was looking at my page and saw the comment at the top under the title and decided Miss Pangborn would be very proud of my wandering mind... or as she says meandering thoughts... and when I thought of her I thought of this movie thats coming out June 11 that looks like one of the funniest movies in the world... Napoleon Dynamite... its going to be great... go to http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/napoleon_dynamite.html to see the preview... you will pee your pants it so funny... If you think its funny then let me know and we'll have to go see it when it comes out. Umm I guess thats all I had to say, maybe I'll find some pictures now...  Dan V

						   Haha I know this is the 4th psot today, but 2 were pictures, and its like a christmas present, I'll play with it for a while and the it will get old, so humor me... read them all... Yeah so firt I'll give Chedward credit for finding this blog host... you should check out his page too... http://seventheclipse.blogspot.com/ ... He's a funny funny man...  Yeah well I'm going to steal yet another thing from Mr. Chad... I'll tell you my weekend... or parts cause its pretty boring. I'll do it the organized way cause i'm like that...  Friday: School wasn't bad... Who am I kidding it sucked like it always sucks. But hey only 11 school days to go. After school I mowed a lady's lawn and got $20... not bad for about an hour of work. I went home and just hung around... played a lot of GTA: Vice City cause I just purchased it tuesday or something like that.  Saturday: I woke up and thought... Hmm More GTA: VC... Then I ate food and got ready for the Memorial Day Parade... I'm a sexy sexy Trumpet Man is the one and only SC Marching Band and proud of it.  The parade went well... other than full whool uniform in sun and hot weather, an hour of waiting, a long walk playing a song I can't play sitting down and feeling band about making chad later than her already was for Cabaret cause he drove me home... I'd have to say hes a good driver... a bit conservitive at times but a good driver with a very nice purple Accent... its got a nice ride but horribly speekers... o well... Toxic still sounded nice on them... RIGHT. So then thats really all of the Saturday. Sunday: Woke up nice a late.  Helped my dad with some yard work and landscaping outside... Dug up some dirt and did some manly sweating... then i called up my good buddy CHedo and suggested a movie... me and him and chris went to see The Day After Tomorrow... Pretty Great Movie... GLOBAL WARMING IS EVIL!!!! the audience made the movie o so much better... WHOO After the movie, we looked at some movie posters with a Virginian woman and her volleyball playing daughter (freshman).  They were nice and all, but ha as chad says she might have been a bit tipsy... And Chad and I both agree that the daughter look familiar... He says chadicus7: maybe every school has the same set of freshman that are slowly corrupting schools all over the nation... hmm he could be right... this years freshmen are particularly evil... and tall. I came home and talked to some people online cause other than Duck Tape and GTA: VC thats all I do... my parents and my sister Renee were watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with Jack Nickleson... scary man... I caught the tail end, its looked like a pretty good movie. Monday: Hmmmmm Nice Long sleep... til like 11, I think it was about 10 hours... o boy was that nice... I got up and just hung around all day... then around 5:30 all 5 of my family members when out to Prospectors... MMMM good food... Just before we left Julie Cutler (sorry if i spelled that wrong :( ) came in with her family... sorry again, but she looks a lot like her litterl brother and sounds a bit like him too. I got home and did homework... thought I had a lot but didn't so that made me happy! Then I came to see who might be online... talked to chad some, saw his BLog and liked it so here I am with my own for all the world to see! Tell me what you think, i'll be putting more pictures of Duck Tape stuff and maybe other stuff on here soon enough...   -Dan V

Any Duck Tape item found on this site is either for sale, or I can make another for you.  Prices are negotiable.  Please tell your friends, relatives, teachers, parents, and random people you see on the street, to come check out my web page and buy some awesome Duck Tape Stuff.  They won't be sorry they did.

						   Yeah well I said not to expect anything else, but I am at Schlow Library waiting to leave for On-Road, and I have nothing to do so I am giong to write this entry. Accually I'm leaving a little earlier today so that I can go to Wegman's and get an application.  I hear that they were advertising for part time workers.  I've heard its a pretty good job with great pay.  I'm really hoping to get a job at Music Mart but I haven't gotten a call back yet and its been almost a week.  I also put in applications at a couple of other places.  Where else can I get a job that's like Music Mart? I don't think Robert M would hire me, they have college + people and they seem like "career people."  I guess I should have asked at Rainbow and Alley Cat, maybe I'll do that Firday cause I'll be back in town for the day Friday because of my last day of On-Road... WHOO. I'm eligable to test for my license today, but I'm going to wait until Friday so that I can test with the school cause I've heard it's a lot better to test with the school.  SO what else? nothing? well thats interesting...  Yeah so people keep coming in and all the computers here are being used so I kind of feel bad about using one for something as useless as this Blog... but then I think whats so important that they need to use this computer? and also there are somepeople in here that I have a feeling are not doing anything useful.  Well then... Let me see... Hmm well I've been working on my arts fest Duck Tape Usables... Also I made a pair of sandles... they aren't the best but I like them. I'm going to be one heck of a duck taped kid at the arts fest.  I'm going to wear my RHCP visor, the sandles, a tie, a belt, and who knows what else I will come up with in the next week....  Wow its only a week away and I have to get on this making thing.  I want to make another 4 belts, 20 flowers, a few visors, another hat, some wallets, ties, and who knows what else... yeah I've got a lot to do but then agian it doesn't take that much time, I probly spend more time chosing a CD to listen to then I do on each item.  Time to go bye...  -Dan V

						   HA... Like there are any of you out there... Well, I'll have to say sorry about not posting in a while.  My Canoe trip was fun and camping over to sunday was also pretty fun... I'll be camping again tonight so don't expect anything new until later tomorrow.  The delay has also been partly due to my computer being infected by horribly crap... but... Thanks to Mr Ebersole Sn. my computer seems to be back in normal working order.    I don't really have much to say cept nothing much has happened and I'm hoping to hear something about Napoleon Dynamite soon.  Monday was my last day of In-Car.  I drove the Focus cause I really like it.  I also used some of my time yesterday looking them up online.  I've decided I like the 3-Door Hatch Back.  The 2003 is a nice model.  New they run around $15000 and a used 2003 would be about $10000... not to bad for a nice car. Yesterday was my first day of On-Road.  I drove the new Malibu.  Its interesting.  We did emergency stops and stalls. I have On-Road again today and Friday.  Thats about all there is, cept I'm going to be posting 2 really funny pictures from Mad mag.  They are a spoof of the IPod ads.  Until I reture and write again...  -Dan V

						   Hello Once Again... Have you ever noticed how when you get only a little sleep, you feel a bit more energized that lots of sleep but only in shoty bursts, but you have a lot less self control...  well then tonight... Untitled Live and Uncut... at band practice. yep thats right more Untitled Practice. I miss yesterdays cause I wasn't home or something but oh well, Eric said they wrote an original and we'll do some more writing tonight...   So other than that what has happened since my last post??? Wellll... A whole lot of nothing.  More In-Car.  I still like the Focus best of all.  I drove the matrix today, and there isn't a wole lot of visibility out the back, but it has a cool interior set up. Its a lot like the Focus crossed with a van. Tomorrow will be the Focus or the Malibu.  Also, I handed in my cover letter and resume at Music Mart... Hoping to get the job, that would be such an awesome place to work. Tomorrow I have a Dentist appointment at 9:30, so after I will go around town dropping off application and resumes.  Maybe I will see Crazy Miss Pangborn again...  Where should I ear lunch tomorrow?  Well then... later there maybe more...  -Dan V

						   Hello Everybuddy... I'm being lazy and a procrastinator, I need to finish these applications, resumes, and cover letters...  Well let me see... Saturday morning I'm going to be leaving for a canoe trip and won't be home until sunday afternoon, so try not to miss me to much. Its about 10:30 am rightnow and my brain is not quite alive. Last night, or I guess this morning, I watched Jason X... 2 am to 4 am, it was pretty much the biggest waist of time ever. I have In-Car again today so I'll be leaving about 11:45 today for town.  I'm hoping to have at least my Music Mart cover letter and application done by then...so... I'll end this now and get to work on that...  Until later when maybe I'm awake and not so lazy...  -Dan V

						   Sorry about the lack of poast as of late... Its a combination of Lazyness and a very boring life...  One thing there is to comment on; I started In-Car Monday (yesterday-feels longer ago than that).  It pretty fun. Yesterday I drove a Honda Civic, nice car but I don't like it that much. Today I drove the Ford Focus and I like it a lot. Tomorrow I'll try and get the sentra, and I guess sometime I'll drive the Malibu.  I hope to drive the Martix, its looks like a prett nice car.  Today we did S's through cones and that was fun, especially with the rain and big puddle.  Wow, I could have my lisence as soon as a week from tomorrow! Thats crazyness...  Other than that I really haven't done much, I go downtown with my mom in the mornings cause she works at Schlow Library and my sisters can't take me in during the day usually.  Yesterday I went to a bunch of different bussinesses and got applications.  I'm hoping to get a job at Music Mart cause that would just be an awesome kind of place to work... Help people look at instruments all day... sounds great to me. Today, I worked on my resume and then wandered around downtown until about 1 when I headed over to the school for In-Car (1:30 each day).  I saw Miss Pangborn again today... HaHa she's pretty funny and I'm not even sure why.  It must be pretty nice having the summer off like us kids.    Well thats all for now, I'm going to post some pictures. I'll be selling AWESOME Duck Tape Stuff at the Arts Fest this year... Come out and buy some great cheap stuff... July 7th 10 to 3.  If you come early enough you can give me an order that will be done by the end of the day.  Until later then...  -Dan V

						   I found a pretty good band completely by accident.  I was searching for something on google and one sight was for a punk band that sounded pretty good so I downloaded some stuff.  You know whats really cool about the band? Its Italian.  The Band is named Punkreas.  I think you should download some stuff or at lease visit their web page  urlLink HERE .  They are punk but not real heavy stuff.  -Dan V

						   Well... I went downtown round 5:30 and met up with Meghan, Nicole, and Bart.  We were doing our Super Fun Day/ Gym Reunion.  I met them on the Porch of Panera.  They had been downtown since like 2 and so they weren't up for more wandering so we just sat.  It was pretty good.  Miss Pangborn, who meghan said they had seen twice already that day, walked by and stopped to say hey and ask how summer has been so far.  That was cool cause she was one of my favorite teachers, and the one I'd most like the pass on the street.  Then the 4 of us started toward the Movies to see Stepford Wives.  On the way we stopped into Gift Adventure and sadly Meghan unknowingly lost her sunglasses while... having some fun... with a big stuffed Polar Bear.  We then left for the Theator.  We got there kind of early so bought our tickets and went into an empty room.  It took like 10 minutes to choose seats cause no one really cared where we sat.  Just as we sat Steph and Hazi came in, saw us, and sat in the row infront of us.  It was a pretty good movie.  Funny and I liked it.  After we decided to eat at Brothers Pizza, but found out it was closed so went to Chili's.  Pretty great food.  And so then we waited for parents.  I'd have to say it was a pretty fun night.  There are lot of movie coming out this summer, so we'll have to go see some.  If you want to see a movie let me know I'll be home most the summer until the end of July and parts of August.  You'd better like movies cause I'll be in touch and we are going to see tons of great movie.  Well I had fun...  -Dan V

						   Well... Untitled has a new member... Matt Ward is our new BagPipe/Piano/Fill-In Man... and I'd have to say its pretty great.  This afternoon, Most of Untitled met and it was pretty good. I'd have to say, Untitled's future is looking pretty bright. August 1 we have a gig in Pine Grove Mills...  So what else today? well today isn't over, but I'll let you know how the first part went...  I woke up nice and early (accually too early, my clock was an hour fast and freaked me out).  I went into town with my mom who works at the Public Library.  I read Mad Mag until like 10:45 and then went to Music Mart where I happened to see Miss Margret Byron.  Then to Quiznos to get a sub with a cupon (I'm such a cheapskate).  Then back to the Library.  My mom took me to Erics House to jam witht Untitled. On our way out I saw Noah.  Eric drove me back tot he Library at about 2:15.  I drove us home and while stopped at at a light, I saw Mr. Patrick Powers in the parking lot of Harner's.    I'm heading out soon to the wander town, a movie, and some food for a Super Awesome Fun Day with some gym conrads...  Until later tonight...  -Dan V

						   Hello Bass Players and Bass Players' Friends... I'm looking at bass amps, and i was wandering if anyone had any suggestions.  I've heard GK's are really good and they seem to be a good enough deal for the quality.  I'm looking at amps that are say 200 to 400 amps. And idealy I'd like a stack with 4 10" and 1 15" speaker. If you know anything at all about bass amps, let me know. Thank you.  -Dan V

						   Well... the first day of summer is only about half over and I already having fun... well kind. As you can see I just posted a bunch of pictures.  I was cleaning up my files and found these and more.  These are the ones I thought you'd all like, or at least, I'd like.  I'll be posting much more but thats all for now...  A PS for the prom couple, I forgot to say, that is all DUCK TAPE... they are the winners of the 2003 Stuck at the Prom Contest hosted by Maco Duck Tape.  Hundreds and Hundreds of people enter each year.  Rules: Make a tux and dress of all duck tape and take a picture.  The best couple wins a $2500 scholarship... Would anyone be interested in going to the prom with me in a Duck Tape Dress?? I will make it for you, you just have to be guttsy enough to wear it and look like you're having a good time... You will forever be my hero if you agree to go with me...  Sorry Gentalmen, but I need a girl to go with me, I dont' think anyone you would look to great in a dress...  Also, if any of you know where I can get a Gnome like the one from Amelie or the one in our ANV picture, please let me know cause that would just make my day from now 'til forever...  Until later...  -Dan V

						   WHEE HEE ~~ SUMMER IS HERE!! How Completely Awesome Is That?? It doesn't feel like summer which in a way makes it so much better...  I have a little bit of saddness though, I didn't get everyone I wanted to sign my yearbook... Oh well I'll just have to keep in touch with them over the summer so there is no need for a memory in some ol' book...  So what is going on with all of you this summer? So far I've heard some pretty great stuff; Cancuun (yeah I know I spelled it wrong...), France, Jersey Shore, Deleware, Ocean City, and some other great ideas...  Hmm I'd have to say this summer is going to be way to cool.  We have to hook up and do something that mean YOU. If you've got ideas let me know.  Hmm I really should be making Chad's Duck Tape Boxers... I think I'll go do that soon.  Right now I just have to say WHEE HEE WHOOPIE DOO WHOO HOO YEE HAA!!  -Dan V

						   Hey sorry for the absents of post for a few days... I got back from Trenton,NJ Saturday night and then was just too lazy to do anything until now...  Well nothing much really happened until today anyways so its not like you've missed anything... I've got to say as sad and horrible funerals are, they are almost ok in a little way... I met family I never knew I had and it was pretty cool, I also got to talk to my three cousins who's dad lives in AZ and they all live in Flordia now (one lived in Costa Rica for a while witch is totally awesome).  They are pretty cool girls.  I also talk to their dad who I am probly going to visit this summer in mid to late August (sorry Victor, but AZ is better than Marching Band).  I'm going mostly for the vacation, but also maybe visiting a college or so.  I'm definately hoping to go to college out there, if not in AZ then knew by cause it is such an awesome State.  Today was the first day of finals and I'd have to say I didn't do as badly as I thought i would... then again that's just how I feel, last year I felt the same way and totally sucked it on most of them... We'll just have to see. Two to go. After school Chad, Chris, Paloma, and I piled into the Acsent and brought Paloma home, not cause she's a good friend or anything but because Chad is just that nice of a guy... but Paloma should not be expecting another ride anytime soon cause she was just a little horrible at her directions and we ended up in almost a complete circle. Then Chad, Chris, and I proceeded to Chirs' house to see who wanted to come play B-Ball at StoneBridge with us.  It ended up being Raz and Pu.  We played b-ball and then some beach volleyball, it was a hard game not cause we were very competetive, but mostly cause we were distacted by some umm... red beachballs by the pool.... umm right... and then we played some more b-ball. Chad had to go pick up his dad at work cause they carpooled this morning, when he got back we had managed to get ourselves (none StoneBridgers) into the pool with the help of Jesse Rodger's little brother who became out instant best friend... Chad brought us home and thats about where I am now...  Tomorrow I'm not sure what I'll be doing after the final 2 finals of this school year WHOOOO HOOOOO!!! I maybe going to Park Forest Pool con Senor Chedo. or maybe not.  So yeah Thank You to Angela D for taking my yearbook to school Friday and getting some people to sign it... I still need some people to sign namely: Marie, Mike, Stosh, Mary, Michael, Cliff, ?Jared?, Big T-Travis, James, Noah, Michelle, Katie Martin, Eric, Patrick, SexySexy Saxton (dan that is - I don't think he'll be there... so sad), and Angela Yen (crap she won't be there either).   If I forgot you I'm so sorry... just let me know and you can sign, I need all the friends I can get...  Hmm I should have made this list for Angela, she doesn't know all my friends, but you did get a lot of good people thank Miss Angie D...  So what are you doing after school tomorrow? How about for the summer?  Friday the movie "Dodge Ball" comes out, and it looks SOOOO Funny... we should see it sometime, maybe not friday but sometime, talk to me if you want to see it... Also heads up on: Napoleon Dynamite... Not sure when its coming here, I think in July. I Love the 90's, if its done as well as I Love the 80's, I Love the 70's, and I Love the 80"s Kicks Back, then it will be awesome... Starting July 12.  Well I maybe posting again later tonight... 'til then...  -Dan V

						   Do you ever feel like stuff all has to happen all at once?  So I won't be in school Friday because of the funeral, Friday just happens to be the last Friday in school, the second day of the Spanish finals, the day I can get some extra credit with Wade (by missing math and talking about a book about fast food, and its horrors), a concert thing with Lemonsoul and North in Lemont, an oppertunity to hang out with some great friends and let myself completely forget about finals and school and all the crap I'll have to deel with come Monday...  Not to mension missing Friday would be the only day I've missed, making this year the first year that I would have gotten perfect attendance, not that I care but it would have been something to think about... not anymore.  But instead Mr Big Man Upstairs decides its time for my awesome cool PopPop to meet St. Peter at the big ol' Pearly Gates...  When people say God works in mysterious ways they are not kidding in the slightest.  Sometimes I wonder how people who don't believe in God can live with explaining everything scientifically... Conincidence is a word that takes the blame and the credit for some much... how can you accually think everything on earth and in the sky and everywhere just happenes to be and that after you die you cease to exist... what would you feel? Nothing? Then how do you know you're dead?  I don't know what to say to a lot of people's questions, but one thing for sure, stuff happens and it happens for some reason that will probly never make sense to you...  Stuff is crazy and I'd just like to let you all know, make everyday the best it can be cause there isn't much you can do about what life serves up about doing what you can is all that keeps you from complete animal insanity...  I'm not sure what thats all suppose to mean... The extra credit isn't all that big of a deal anyways, I'd need a 310 out of 200 on the World History Final to get an A for the year... so whats it matter anyways?  -Dan V

						   Hmm well... Bonnie would be pretty high on a list of "Nicest People I Know."  I met Bonnie Jean in 6th grade, we were in the same "Core Studies" Room with a nuttso teacher who left us a even more nuttso sub when she took an extended leave of absents.  We weren't best friends or anything but she was a pretty awesome person. The next year we both has Mr Bandel for math... haha what an odd class... One thing about Bonnie that has always stuck with me is how she made me feel like we'd been friends for years, I accually asked her if she remembered something that happened in like 3rd grade even thought she didn't go to my elementry school and I didn't meet her until 6th grade. I think its her genuine kindness and fun personality.    I dont' remember if Bonnie was in any of my classes since 7th grade math, but this year she is in my Bio 1 class... haha what an awesome class (as I've said before).  Bonnie adds to that class but I'm not sure how... haha well Bonnie will aways be a fun memory for all the old years of my life...  -Dan V

						   Well, once again we tried to make Wade proud of us but ended up deciding to just play "Bash Wade" and relize half the answers she gives us are not right... This got us wondering if she will have the ScanTron programed to accept the right answer or her answer will be on the Final... Erg...  So today it was Chad, Angela D, Stosh, Michael C, Becky, and I at Panera.  Chad's  car  only fits 5 and despite Stosh's willingness to ride in the trunk, we decided it would be best for soemone to walk... Angela volunteered and I, being the nice guy I am, said I'd walk with her so she wasn't alone... Chad had to stop for gas, so we all got to Panera at about the same time. We started off well, going over one of the tests, but then some of us got some food and nothing much happened while we ate, and after that we didn't do a whole lot of work, but it was ok cause we were really just rechecking ourselves and we have tomorrow inclass to work on it.   We decided to bash Wade a bit cause it just fit so well... and we found that she had answered differently for the same question for the two class represented at todays study session. It was like 5:30 when we finally finished and I finally got home around 6ish... I'd have to say it was a fun day.  I'm hoping more fun stuff will being happening this summer and such.  Well lets see, I guess it time for the sad news... if you don't like sad news skip this part I will tell you when its safe to read again...  Today my Grandfather passed away... odd way to say it.. Its sad because I will miss him and everything, but I don't believe it is a horrible thing because he was 92, lived a full life, did what he wanted to do, and as far as I could tell had fun to the end.  He was definately an awesome grandfather... and as much as it seemed to be approaching, it was a surpise... Pray for him if you do that. thanks  OK SAVE TO READ THE SAD NEWS IT OVER...  Well I guess that it for now... I may be doing another one of those "profiles of a friend" (like the one of Robin and Angela)  -Dan V  P.S. Sorry about not having any Pictures for today's session...

						   Hey this is for all of you, but partly for Angela D... See I can write about you too...  Angie D... What is there to say about a person like her???  Well.... She is absolutely crazy... but in a good way. I have World History and English with her... Almost my first class, and my last class... great way to begin and end a day...  If you ever see Angela frown, no scratch that, if you ever see her not smiling, take a picture it will be a one of a kind rarity...  And you know something else??? Angela my seem to be a "dumb blonde and in lack of common sence (which I guess she is at time), but she has asked me some of the most insightfull and interesting questions I've ever heard... Stuff that makes you think more than anything else... Its really pretty great.  As I said about Robin, If you don't know Angla (oops spelled it like she did...on her wall in paint) Angela* then you really should get to know her... You won't be sorry.  -Dan V

						   Ah hA so i remeber what I really wanted to say today with the study group thing...  As many of you have probly noticed I've been growing out my Italian Facial Hair for about 2 and a half weeks (shaved last on Fri May 21), well I didn't shave it off, but I did clean it up... I am not quite the bum I was...  Speeking of hair... Do you think I should grow it out on top again? Either like earlier this year or like in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Picture below...  Well as Johnny B says "The opposite of Annyong"  -Dan V

						   O wait one more thing...  Touching Evil: Awesome show, on every Monday night @ 10 pm... You definately should watch it.  It's about a detective that got shot in the head and when he recovered (if you can call what he is now recovered) he was hired by SCI: Serial Crime Investigations (I don't think thats the exact right name, but you get the idea).  He is reall funny but also a great agent.  He has this insight that is creepy and awesome... If I had to compare it to other shows I'd say is almost like CSI with the investigation of Crimes, but not exactly the same.  It's really hard to compare, and there isn't usually to much of the victums.  You have to watch it and tell me what you think.  -Dan V

						   Well here I am... nope haven't forgotten about all 2 of you who read this, just nothing fun or exciting has happened since the last posts.  Well... Today changed that. Nothing to great happened all day... just another boring day of stuff... the highlight had to be being Partied by Robin... haha I feel so bad for anyone who missed the beginnings of Party. But... After school Angela D, Chad, Meg Hoover, Brandon, and almost Stosh (Grama stole him away...) went to Big Eats and studied for Wade's world history final... and had way to much fun.  HaHa wow so yeah I don't know if I'll do any better on my final but I know it was nice to do something fun after school. I never really knew Meg Hoover before, shes a pretty funny person. while eating some french (or are they still freedom) Fries: Meg: "Just so you all know I'll be running tonight" Brandon: "Running what?" Meg (with no hesitation): "My Mouth"  And you know whats really fun about it all... We are doing it again tomorrow... WHOO. you can tell I don't get out much...  So I guess thats all for now... I'll be back with more later maybe... I'm to lazy to think of anything else I wanted to say right now...  -Dan V

						   Chad: "R-o-b- i -n? Tweet Tweet." Robin: "Did you just tweet at me?!?"  Ha Robins Rocks... yeah so my Saturday was pretty great mostly thanks to Miss Robin...  Before I tell you that I have to say how crazy it is that my eye doctor's name is Robin Du tt  and Robin's name is Robin Du nn ... Funny, ain't it?  So, My day, Robin and Robin's rockin'ness... I woke up nice and early to go volunteer at Special Olympics.... Aren't I just the nicest kid ever? I was home about 12:30. Had to clean my room and stuff. Round 5:30 I left for Dollar General to get a birthday card for the Robin' who has turned 16 monday and got her permit today... while in the store I heard the sad news of Formal Presiden's Regan's death due to Altimers... Sad news though I never knew the guy... I'd have to say the card was pretty good... on the fround was  "This year I went all out for you..." Inside "...I got you this card and an evenelope."  I added "and of cource some party" If that last part makes no sence to you... I feel sorry for you and the fact that you missed the DC Spy Museume and the awesome buss ride home... I also included a small envelope of "party" also part of the DC Trip awesomeness...  I proceeded to Robin's house to party with the rest of them... pretty good party, great people, great music (a lot of the Who and RHCP, and 93.7 the BUS), gread volleyball and pingpong games, and of cource great cake.... hehe droped all but a bite of my first piece... sorry Robin's Mom... Robin got some pretty great presents...  Well thats why Robin Rocks today, most other days she just rocks cause shes Robin... If you don't know her, then you should...  If you know Robin's favorite flower that would be pretty cool of you to tell me... Thats all I've got to say to you as of now so adios, chao, and goodbye...  -Dan V

						   No I'm not telling you about Sunday, its just that i relized what I really liked about the movie, "The Day After Tomorrow."  Its the fact that there was no bad guy.  All the problems were a result of mankinds own actions.  There couldn't be a hero that defeated the evil in one quick attack, there was no one representing at that is bad in this world, it was a picture of what we will do to ourselves.  Not having a bad guy gave the movie a different depth, people could defend themselves from the weather, but they could never fight back against it.  If you haven't see the movie yet you should, at least plan on seeing it when its out on video/DVD, its pretty good.  -Dan V

						   The Time to Introduce all of you to my band has come... Untitled is: Eric N on Drums... Dan V on Bass... Justin P on Guitar... and maybe if his parents get smart... Chris D on Vocals...  Eric and I have had a "band for a couple years now, guitarists  and vocalists have given us problems the entire time, but we have a good feeling about Mr. JP on guitar and hoping for goodthings from Chris.  As of now we have not written any complete songs, Eric and I have thrown around some ideas, but bass and drums don't make the best songs...  Eric had the genious idea to add a bagpipe... I love the idea, What do you think? Well, now you know Untitled, look out for us at any high school concerts. We don't have much of a set music style, but we like bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Blink 182, Metallica, Led Zepplin, Rush, and many others...  Untitled... who needs a name when the music says it all?  -Dan V

						   WHOO Friday is here at last.  Hmm, funny how this whole week felt like friday cept today... Nothing exciting happened cept we watched our movies in English... Crazy Man Johnny is FUNNY! And I had forgotten about most of my groups... funny thing is I was the only one in the group who had seen the whole thing until today.    And after School Chad drove me home! Whoo... I got home like 20 minutes earlier than usual... it was nice... Can't wait til I can drive.  I called Goodwill to see if my aplication would be considered again now that they are hiring again... I hope I get the job cause it would be so nice to work right there by school, and I've heard its a pretty easy job... I'd be pretty with most any job right about now... I need some money. Well thats about it.... Have a great weekend and Good Luck if you are taking the SATs tomorrow...  -Dan V

						   Well, Today was not to much of a special day, as far as days go.  Thursday... Not early in the week but not quite friday... So in gym we're playing Softball... hmm not my best sport, but I'd have to say I made a pretty impressive catch both day and yestday... it made me pretty happy.  I'd have to say not many sports made me happy this year, volleyball (suck at it but  like it) and football have been the only two I've liked.  Hmm o well, its all almost over *grin*    So after gym I had a pretty uneventful school day.  Miss Pangborn informed us all that the underclassman year books will be here Wednesday... That sounds fun.  I waited for my bus until about 3:40 just to sit on it for another half hour plus... arg as Steve says, "Our bus driver sucks so bad she should be arrested for prostitution."  So then my sister drove me to Bigler Field for the Special Olympics Opening Cerimony with the State College High School Marching Band... WHOO HOO... honestly tell me why I joined for another year?  Does it get fun? Was I brainwashed? Am I that much of a loser? Well I guess it can be fun... High Way is fun. The Ceremony went well...  My sister came and picked Me and Chad up... It was a surprisingly quiet ride home...  I didn't have any  real  homework, I should do the math review (first third due monday) or the biology review (don't remember most of it), but I decided to eat some cookie (that my sister so kindly made for the family) and come online to talk to all my wonderful friends (Chad and Chris D).    Well I guess I let myself ramble again... sorry 'bout that...  -Dan V

						   Ha so there I kept my word... the next two were pictures... Alright I'll admit they are random pics I found on my comp, but hey deal with it. So yeah yesterday... Not a bad day... After school I went to the eye doctor for my last appointment concerning contacts, I hae 8 boxs now... set for a year... that makes me pretty darn happy... glass really are annoying... after the eye doctors, my mom and I met my sister before work. While in Panera it started to rain really hard and that made me really happy... I love Rain.  Lucky for me, it was till raining when we left.  Hmm Rain...  Well... next order of buisiness... I've got to pass on a situational question that Miss Angie D asked me and asks a bunch of people... An evil dictator takes over the world and tells you that everyone Highschool age and up must choose a spouse.  No devorce or Cheating allowed.  You must be able to spend forever with them and it doesn't matter if they like you back or not.  If you have a significant other pretend you don't and answer me this... Who would you choose?  Well then... I will talk to all of you later... and make sure you leave comments... I promise more Duct Tape pictures to come.  -Dan V

						   Well I have remembered... I would like to introduce all of you to the wonderful word known as Quleshe... It is a word I accidenally made up when trying to type cliche to Angela Yen... So some credit must go to her for forcing me to attempt such a difficult word. After typing it i decided it should become a word.  So I entered it into Urban Dictionary and made a definition.   urlLink Here  is the definition.  I think a lot of you will be feeling quleshe within the next couple weeks, because of finals and such... I wish you well on that adventure... been feeling that way for a couple weeks now, and its really not to bad. I promise the next entry will not be boring, it will be a picture or two...  -Dan V

						   Whoo so its accually June now... that means summer is on its way!!! wow haha i need summer so much... this year is turning my guts into a big ol' knot.  Well... hope yall had a rip roarin' good time this past weekend.  I know mine was pretty good.  Hmmm so I already forget what I was going to say when i set out to write this post... o well it will come to be evenually... i'll just ramble til then. Miss Pangborn is my hero of the day... I think it was last year that I was talking to a friend about how teachers never taught us basic grammer. Upto a certain grade the teacher never made you use grammer vocab, but just helped you make your sentences better.  Then after that point teachers assumed that you learned it all the year before and never even reviewed much.  I remember my sisters teaching me what a noun is and that was the only basic grammer i learned for years.  In 7th grade we touched on some of it but it was a more advanced level.  To day Miss Pangborn took the period to teach all the basic grammer.  Stuff I pretty much knew from picking up little bits over the years, but never knew how it all worked together... For that I have to say "THank You MIss Pangborn"  Well then... I'd have to say I will miss some of my teachers very much, much more so than last year... also I will miss a lot of the classes I have, I got pretty lucky with the people in my classes.  Bio has to be one of the greatest bunch of people I've had in a class since 7th grade English, which was pretty great.  Any suggestions to where I should apply for a job? I was thinking Cold Stone (thanks for the idea Robin), Weis (right near school nice and easy), or Rag 'n' Bone (awesome place, sadly not hiring).  If you have any ideas I woudl be happy to hear...   Well I will leave you now... Forgive my rambling please, until later...  -Dan V

						   Well... Wilderness Camp was Fun... and VERY VERY Wet... Hmm I should learn to back a lighter backpack... or become a beast of a hiker... Well, Other than rain, Wilderness was fun...  And you know what... GIG tomorrow... WHEEE that'll be a rush...  ummm yeah so a week away brainwashed me in a way so I don't really know what to say so...   Hey Mike Tyson/ Amy... Oregon you say... thats pretty far from humble (and rainy) PA... I'm doing pretty well... how about you?  I just read you latest post (sorry too lazy to read more then that...) but its crazy cause you remind me a of a friend, lynn, and you mention Kelsey and McKenzie... I know people with those names and they are not common sames... well ok I guess this is getting to be as rambling (and worse) than your last post... which in my eyes went a perfectly clear path... then again look at my posts...

						   Yeah so our Microwave broke... 3rd one in not to long of a time... the first was a loyal micro, but the second and thrid stunk... both GEs that died and displayed criptic messages... We just got your 4th tonight... We opened the box... Unwraped the Microwave... Opened the Door... AND... SQWish... had to kill a spider that had taken a ride in it from China where it was assembled... Hmm yeah... a living Chinese spider.  Well I just had to write it down or I wouldn't believe my memories in a couple years...  Screwy world...  By the Way this tough spider reminds me of the one Eric, Justin, and I found at an Untitled practice... remember that gentlemen?  -Dan V

						   Yeah so, I've been tired I think since about September but for some reason I have more energy and than Jolt right about now....   This happens to me every once and a while and I like referring to it as Punchy...  Its is the state I reach after night after night of limited sleep and a goodly amount of stress or anxiousness doesn't hurt... But don't get me wrong and think Punchy is another of my made up words, other people use the term... well my mom uses it, if she counts...  Do you know the feeling I'm talkinga bout?  Well I can't stand to keep typing its too slow...   -Dan V  PS I think I would make a very Violent Drunk so don't try and get me intoxicated...   -Dan V

						   Two random things...  New singer (new to me at least): Jamie Cullum      He is a little like Jeff Buckley, cept up beat and not as       good. Check him out if you get a chance.  I randomly found this web page: http://www.qis.net/~jimjr/life87.htm Its kind of funny, my favorite, I think, is "Never get into knock-down, drag-out fist fights with ugly people, they have nothing to lose."  well thats all I have for you for now...  -Dan V

						   Whoo so I've done a whole bunch since last post... WHEE, I like being able to drive...  Thursday Angela and I went bowling to get her away from her annoying sister... I got to drive. Friday I went downtown and hung out with Angela, Matt, Chris, John, Robin and some her friends.  We hung out on Old Main lawn... pretty good... drove that night too. Saturday I went downtown once again and hung out with Angela, Matt, Chris, John, Katie Martin, Kate Sobel, Steph, Steph's "cousin" Jen, Robin and some of her friends. And then Chad showed up later cause he got home from the beach.  I didn't drive cause I wanted to stay for Kairos at 11:30 and I'm not aloud driving after 11 cause I have a Jr Lisence. Sunday I went downtown, not the last time, and then a bass lesson and then back downtown, I hung out with Angela, Chad, Chris, Jordan, Matt, Steph, Kate, Katelyn, Michelle, Meghan, Devon, Pat Powers, Robin, Becky, and Robin's friends. It was a pretty great concert.  Jordan Thomson sat in with the Earthtones on a couple songs which is pretty awesome.  His dad is the singer.  I drove that night too. Tonight I went to see Anchorman with Angela, Chad, Jordan, Chris and was surprised to see Robin and Adam.  It was a pretty great movie... I like the Character Brick the most... he was awesomely funny... You should see it if you haven't yet. We could not stop laughing.  Then we went to College Pizza and then waited for rides.  I drove and took Chad, so being the nice kids we are, we waited for everyone elses' ride to come.   All for the the nights I drove (and the only 4 times I've driven late enough at night to have to worry about the 11 pm rule since getting my lisence) I roled into my driveway at exactly 10:58...  Yep so I had a bunch of fun but now that the Arts Fest is over I'm not to sure what I'll do...  Yep so that about all I've been up to so thats all I really have to say...  I promise not to let it go as long before my next post.  -Dan V

						   I'm sorry I almost forgot to thank everyone who came to my booth yesterday... Thank you for coming to see me even if I wasn't your main reason... Kate, George, Steph, Micheal, Marie, Eric, Matt, Linsey and everyone else... sorry if I forgot you... its just my bad bad memory... I'm getting old...  Especially thanks to those who supported my insain crazy with a material made to fix windsheilds in WWII and then later used for ducts...   Random: Robin and I now know how to tie a bow tie and what cravats and ascots are... we also decided I am going to be a Cheese Connoisseur and she will be a Hair Dye Connoisseur. My one restriction/limitation is the cheese that scottish farmers made and then let maggots diggest for like a year and then have a big family reunion to eat even though it's is illegal to make, and Robin's is no blonde... We also decided to never let maggots dictate when we eat cheese... yeah i know its random but hey its something to talk about at 1 am...  Until I get bored again...  -Dan V

						   Well... Kids Day of Arts Fest went pretty well... I made about $100... I didn't see as many of you as I had hoped. I'm not sure if I am going to do it again next year. One of the radio stations asked me a few questions and then asked if they could use some Tape... I accually had a total of 5 people ask to use some tape... If nothing else, I helped 5 people today.  I am still accepting orders for duck tape use-ables.  If you want to order something just email me at Danvalenza21@hotmail.com.  Tell me what it is you want, colors, discription, and how much you'd pay for it. I'll email you back to discuss your order.  After Arts Fest, I went to Untitled practice... Wow we ROCK...  We're working on some songs right now, and have almost 2 completely done... No lyrics cause our singer quit... Do you know a singer who likes a ton of kinds of music and can write lyrics? Please Let Me Know...  By the Way the bass I have a picture of on this Blog is sold sorry to anyone who wanted to buy it...  Whoo Arizona!  Hmm well thats about it for now... I'll probly think of something else, but for now good bye...  -Dan V

						   Well I am back from the weekend... and... some awesome news, for me at least... I got my Lisence (now if i could only spell)!!!  Yeah pretty awesome...  So Jared Dillion's parents had a 4th of July picinic, and my parents let me drive myself so that I could leave before them... It is pretty great to drive alone... Its a lot different then with a permit...  And then I came home and started watching Donnie Darko again cause it was just that good and I know it's one of those movies you have to watch a lot to really get it all... I'm watching it as we speek in a start stop kind of way.  Yeah so... If you want to make me a rabbit suite like the one in Donnie Darko, I will give you rides and love you forever...  Until later...  -Dan V

						   Hmm... I really would like to just straight out say I hate the generic sad sap, rags to riches, nerd getting the girl, teen angst movies.  But I can't, if it is a well made movie then it makes you want to say and watch, it makes you want to help the main character, it makes you sad, and you cna't help but smile when the entirerly too predictable ending comes.  The main character is always clueless and completely flat in character.  And in the end they will be better off than you, and you know it, but you still can't help but feel what they feel and know this is your story just with the ending you haven't gotten to yet.  You almost feel home, and no matter how much you tell yourself that it is a movie and a horrible one at that, you can't ignor the fact that so much of it is more believable than the life  you're living.   Not exactly sure what I want trying to say there, but I think I said what I wanted to say.   So... about 2 hours til my driver's test... hmm I'm kind of nervous, but I don't know I feel like as long as I watch my speed, stop before crosswalks, and dont' hit the curb on the way out, I should be fine... Whoo, driving is going to be pretty great, I think...  Hmm, haven't been playing my bass lately...  I won't be home until tomorrow afternoon.  Duck Tape... wow I haven't made even half of what I need for the Arts Fest... I'll have to pull an all nighter the next couple of days... What is your favorite kind of flower?  Well I've been random long enought, I'll be leaving now, try not to be too sad...  -Dan V

						   Check out the Donnie Darko Web Page  urlLink HERE .  Its best to have your screen resolution set at the highest, because you need to be able to see a lot of web page and it isn't scroleable. I dont' know if you understood what that last part ment but I think you will if you check out the site. Don't go if you haven't seen the movie.  Well again, goodbye.  -Dan V

						   I think thats a movie title... Well here I am in the Schlow computer lab being bored until 2pm. I'm going to hand in my Wegman's application today. Yesterday was a week from when I handed in my resume and cover letter to Music Mart. I think I'll call them early next week.  Hmm...  I wonder if anyone accually reads this... Don't be shy, leave a comment. I promise it won't make me hate you even if it is mean.  Yeah so I'd have to say I like Jake Gyllenhaal's preformance in Donnie Darko and October Sky more then The Day After Tomorrow, not that he sucked or anything.  28:6:42:12  Have you ever seen pulp fiction? I've heard it's good and I want to see it but someone already checked it out and I am too Lazy and poor to go rent it. I also have to see Fight Club, and about a million other movies... Is there anything in theators right now worth seeing?  .... Oh Yeah I have to see Dodgeball.  Spider-Man 2 looks good and got a great review in Rolling Stone.  What do you think about White Chicks.  Personally I don't think its going to be all that great.  It just looks like another movie full of racial jokes and cheap humor.  Well, I don't have to go anywhere, but I'm done here so I'll say farewell for now... I may be back sooner than you think.   -Dan V

						   WOW... I just finished watching Donnie Darko and pretty much all I have to say is Thank You Steph, Robin, and Kate for telling me to see it. It is one heck of a crazy movie. If you haven't seen it, go rent it and watch it ASAP... It all just fit together.  The acting, the storie, the soundtrac, just everything.  Its almost in a small way like Stir of Echoes which is another good movie. And it reminded me of Memento and Vanilla Sky.  Wow... Very odd movie.  The most beautiful work combination: CellarDoor...  -Dan V

						   Well... I just LOVE summer... I just wasted my whole morning watching movies on tv.  First I watched Young Frankenstien...HAHA that is one hell of a funny movie. Mel Brooks is a GENIUS! Then I watched Angus.  Its about a fat kid who tries to survive teen years.  It was pretty good I guess.  Kind of boring and predictable... but hey it beats the sox off school.  So what else is up for me today? Hmm not sure. Probly have to clean my room and then I'll probly try and make a bunch of Duck Tape Stuff cause I am really far behind I have less than a week... o well I'll get it done. I'll just not sleep for a while.  Does anyone know when Napoleon Dynamite will be in theators here in good old State College? That looks like an awesome movie.  Well ok I'll try and find some pictures for you-all or maybe I'll do something fun then I accually have something interesting to write about...  Until Then.  -Dan V

						   I fixed all the problems... at least as many as anyone could... I will admit as crazy as it sounds, sometimes I wish the day was longer... but really what I'm saying is I wish there weren't so many required classes...  Fall - 1. Orchestra/Chem Lab fri 2. Chem 1 - Davis 3. Band/ Study Hall mon, wed, thurs 4. CP English - Horgas 5. Creative Writing - Myers 6. CP US History - Long 7. Adv Precalc - Sutherland 8. Drafting Arch 1 - Klaus  Spring - Same cept: 5. Phys Ed - Mackes/ Lunch fri  If you know anything about any of the teachers, have any classes with me, or anything else that would make me happy, or maybe just not as bored... then TELL ME, won't you please?  WHoo so far I know I have lunch (yes the once a week for only half the year) with 2 people I know... Robin and Steph... Well lets make that one day a week a fun one... See you both ever Friday of the second Half... If I survive...  Yes you read it right... I am in Orchestra and not on Trumpet, On the string bass... Whoo... don't worry I'll play softly until I accually know what I'm doing up there... See you there James and Jenny...  Sad but True (yes thats a Metallica Song): I was going to have Basic Drawing (at the suggestion of Klaus to anyone interesting in architecture), but the day is just too short and correspondence gym would have taken a lot of convincing from me to my parents...  FergFaces... Do you remember Mackes???? I think she was there for 2 years... one of the longer staying gym teacher (another being Mr Ishler).  WEll ok then, until later to all of you all...  -Dan V
