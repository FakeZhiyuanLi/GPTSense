      Monday was kids day at Summerfest.  GameRiot was pizacked to the gizills.  I’m going to be attaching some pix here.  Absolute mayhem, I think we even had our youngest tournament winner today.  This guy was MAYBE seven years old and he ruled his competition. Soon I’ll be putting pictures of all competitors in one large post.  Then I’ll try to get pictures in every couple of days.

      Today I learned about the “Lake Effect”.  Needless to say rain was in the forecast again.  Again more bands stopped by the GameRiot tent and kicked it for awhile.  Early this week Particle stopped by and rocked the Mech Assault system link games

      I checked the Summerfest  urlLink website  this morning and I was happy to see GameRiot on the front page.  Front page!! We are famous!!    Another band made an appearance at GameRiot.   urlLink Tantric  stopped by.  They spent some serious time playing Leisure Suit Larry.  They swore to me that this was the only game where they could “score”… whatever that means.

      Woo Hoo!! No more rain today.  This is more like summer.   Today  urlLink Pomeroy  stopped by in the tent.  I caught part of their set on one of the many stages here at summerfest and I have to say, they rule.  After kicking butt on their stage they came and cleaned up on ours.  One of the guys made it to the finals of our Soul Caliber tournament.  Actually it was one of our more interesting tournaments.  We had a boyfriend/girlfriend fighting it out for the finals.  Now there’s a tough one.

      Hey hey hey!!  Welcome to Summerfest.  It is raining cats and dogs but that doesn’t keep people in Milwaukee from kickin’ it!! People are still out here partying, ponchos and all.  So, I have two questions:   When does Milwaukee settle down? & Why don’t I live here?  I’ve got some good pictures and I’ll be posting pictures of all the tournament winners along with some killer pictures of the venue and the show later in the week.  The  urlLink Darkness  made an appearance in our tent today.  If you didn't catch them on the stage you would have caught them in the tent.      ns

      I missed Summer Fest last year.  I missed it by a week or two and to this day I still regret it and this is why.  As far as I can tell people in Milwaukee love to hang out in the streets and party.   Summer in Brew Town rivals the atmosphere of Bourbon Street.  The cops block off the roads and people party… and party.  Honestly I can’t wait to bring our show to Milwaukee.

      I am on my way out to LA for GameRiot pre-production. As I’m sitting here in row 16 seat c of my flight I’m starting to think about the games on Gameriot.  In particular the pre-release games I’ll shortly be loading onto machines.  Microsoft has really stepped to the plate for the summer tour.  Tomorrow I’ll be loading Jade Empire, Forsa, Sudeki and MechAssault Lone Wolf and Conker.  We had Sudeki out on the tour last year and it looked phenomenal then and at E3.  Lone Wolf also looks sweet.  I’m a huge Xbox Live fan and I can’t wait to start throttling unsuspecting Atlases.

      To my knowledge nothing like this has been done before, well nothing on a scale of this. When we started at the Lollapalooza festival tour last year we had somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 Xbox kits and 30 top of the line Alienware machines.  Since then we have expanded.  Now there are more PCs and plasma screens in the area where we have our tournaments.  Our website has a rather apt description of our show:  GameRiot is the largest traveling video games event and competition in the world. It offers gamers a chance to be the first to play the hottest new and unreleased titles. The event features over 70 state-of-the-art Xbox and PC gaming stations with the newest PLASMA and LCD screen technologies, competitions every hour, a huge assortment of prizes, the Blockbuster Halo Championship, and the celebrated GameRiot Girls. In a raging party environment, GameRiot also features the hottest DJ tracks, surprise celebrity appearances, and lots of cool giveaways. It has hosted the premieres of some of the best selling video games. GameRiot has appeared in over 30 cities, with 90,000 attendees to date, and will have over 250,000 attendees this summer and fall.   However if I had to quantify what I want to bring to Gameriot it would be this, “We’ll bring E3 to Columbus Ohio”,”E3 in Lansing Michigan” or “E3 in McAllen Texas”.  If you are unfamiliar with E3 it’s one of the entertainment industry’s premier trade shows.  Literally every game in every stage of development is shown both in public and behind closed doors.  Along with all the deal making and hand shaking that goes on at E3 there is an excitement that goes along with all the pre-release games, parties, music, lights and booth babes.   At E3 you must be an industry insider to gain entrance.  At Gameriot you spend a few bucks on a ticket or a pass and you get in.  No industry insiders here.
