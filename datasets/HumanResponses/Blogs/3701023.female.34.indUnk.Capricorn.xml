      When Enrico woke me up this morning (1 p.m. in fact ^_^) I was so weak I thought I had a flu...gah. Fortunately, I was okay after a couple of hours but I gotta do something with this cough...mostly, I might as well stop keeping  all  the windows in the house  open  at the same time so that instead of feeling like I live on the seventh floor downtown - which is the undeniable reality anyway - it actually feels like I'm by the sea, or by the mountains, what with all the lovely winds and cool draughts... :coughs: ^_^  Speaking of which, they said that starting on Monday we're going to have the very same hot, african weather we had last summer...Scary! In Italy we are not used to having air conditioning in the houses but I get the feeling this detail will be very different in just a few years from now...

      Wow, two  great  games in two nights, yay! the European Soccer Championship is becoming increasingly exciting and I never thought I was going to say this after my team had to get its lazy ass back home ^_^  Oh, and yesterday it was the city's patron saint holiday hence...I couldn't call the dentist ^_^ But the good news is I just decided it's time to stop once and for all feeding my soul with inconsistent and useless fears. At the end of the day I'm  happy  no matter what, and intend to go on this way.

      Today my mood has been so weird I've shifted from happy and relaxed to kinda sad and lonely.   Having no job really sucks, dude.  Besides the moody stuff, there are too many things I'd love to do and at least one thing I  have  to do, although I'd rather play dumb about it: going to the dentist. Eek!   Geez I'm scared like a five-year-old although I know too damn well it ain't gonna hurt...still, I can't seem to take the decision and call the doc. I hate having to spend money  now  for a goddam couple teeth, that's it. But I better do it soon anyway, before they start aching. Wisdom teeth, how ironic that I have to have  them  removed...Tomorrow I promise I'm going to call the dentist. I know that with all the serious issues I could be worrying about this is definitely one of the smallest, but I can't help feeling it's actually a crucial point...maybe cause I know that if I don't have the guts to do such a ridiculously stupid and necessary thing, I won't be able to sleep at night thinking how fool I've become. Maybe because I need to feel kinda safe, and sane, and okay, starting from my teeth...God, it's scary to realize how not having a job makes you focus onto yourself in a way you had forgotten because you were too busy working all day long and enjoying your status -  and  your money, aww! When one and a half year ago I had a very serious issue with one tooth I acknowledged the pain only the moment the only possible thing left to do was to be taken to the hospital in a rush, all the while begging the Lord to please just make me pass out pleeeeeeease. Hee!    I'm definitely calling the dentist first thing tomorrow morning ^_^

      Hiya blog world. I feel SO ridiculous I can't even start to explain, hee! Main reasons I'm here are that I'm still unemployed and the summer is a-coming, this meaning that finding a job is getting possibly harder than usual hence I'll go on having way too much time on my hands these days :p  Besides, I'm a sucker for tv shows while Enrico definitely isn't :p But he reads a few blogs every now and then so he was the one to suggest I get a blog of my own...I guess in order to share my interests and random babbling with people who might actually understand my squeeing - hee!  Last but not least, Bob Mould has a blog. Holy cows!  Bob Mould  has a blog :) The silly thing is that I'm not American and I'm not English either, I'm in fact 100% Italian...still I chose English here as writing in English is much more fun so I'm going to do it this way. Just bear with me when I spell wrong, do grammar mistakes and sound painfully horrible from time to time :D

      Just a very quick post to say we went to see Iggy Pop and the Stooges on their only italian tour date, tonight. Maybe tomorrow I'll talk about their music that still totally rocks yada yada, but now I just feel kinda like saying ->  squeeee!  Holy cows. Iggy is such a slut, mwhahahaha! I just  love  him. He looked like he was ready to fuck, you know, the whole front row, hee! Dude, he sure as hell looks better than tons of guys who're half his age and God knows I was SO impressed. Couldn't keep my eyes off him even though I had to struggle all the time with the tallest guys in the park, who - of course - were standing  right  in front of me the whole gig ^_^
