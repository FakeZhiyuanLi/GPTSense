Now I have started another.. but still I'm not doing good with my reading.. cuz I hate it.  I miss Brittany and Sammers.. they are gone until Wednesday.. and I'm not gunna see them because I am leaving on that day. I hope they have fun.. and I'll see them after that fo' sho'.. mwahaa  I also miss Heather.. she is in Albany and I am sending her mail tomorrow to make her unbored.. haha I am such a good friend!.. When she gets back we are going to go to the movies cuz we both really want to see the Notebook.. and it is at the strand.. yeah.   Song of the day -   Franz Ferdinand - take me out   -Good song.. but easily gets stuck in your head..-

           I haven't felt well for a few days and I am beginning to feel better.. I don't know why, but I haven't been sick for a long time. - Weird.. but I felt sick this week.. but never threw up or anything.. just felt like shit!      School is comming very fast and I hate it. There was barely any summer whatsoever.. it was like never hott. And along with school comes soccer season.. which means lots of running and exercise.. I better get practicing.. ugh. I also was supposed to read this summer, this was supposed to happen while i was tanning - I tanned twice.  Pages for reading contract - 0     It sucks but its the truth..  I'm going to Hampton Beach with the fam. soon - what fun.. - Hopefully, I will get  some  reading and running done while I'm there.. 'cause I know I'm not gunna get any done when i get home.. well maybe a little but im not wasting the little bit of summer I have left on that shit.       Anyway.. I should get reading. My first book.. I laugh at myself.. haa
