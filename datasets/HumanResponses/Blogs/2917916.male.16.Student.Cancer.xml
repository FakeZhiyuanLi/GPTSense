        Here It Goes...  Hey~ Okay, I finally have the balls to do this, thanks to Derek and Steph!  Here is how I feel...I like steph SO much, but I feel like she lies to me to make me happy. I ask her out on a date...while at the same time, she is asking someone else out on a date. It just sucks feeling like you're being lead on. For the record...Love is a strong word and I don't necessarily love anyone, so my love for steph is not getting stronger. My like is getting stronger. Mabey I'm not getting led on...ya never know. But the reason I decided to post this is I want honesty...so why not give honesty?  Their ya go.  ~Andy

        HAPPY BIRTHDAY TARA!  Hey~ Today, I hung out with the wayside kids! It was really fun being with them all. We did the usual and went to the park. The park was alright, we played don't touch the ground tag for a little while! Than, Taylors mom picked us up and we just hung out at their house for a while! It was REALLY fun being with Taylor, we had never hug out alone and trying to play karaoke was AWESOME! Than, Tara got out of her 2.3 hour shower and watched Peter Pan with us! We than all went to Down in the Valley. What an awesome store! Oh yeah, we ha a great talk about winning the powerball. Tara is gonna by some powerball tickets and win the 212 million dollar PRIZE! It's gonna happen! We than went to Arby's. That was probably the funniest thing ever. I pretended Tara was my mom who had me at age sixteen. I was screaming how It's not my fault she got knocked up, and I wanna live with daddy, and how she always gets me curly fries when I ask for straight fries. Wow, that was great! We than picked up Derek, Thomas, Steph and Matt! We went out to Friday's for Tara's 18th BIRTHDAY! That was fun! I got some sesame chicken strips and saw my favorite waitress, Jessica! It was really fun! We than went to this park and hung out. S**** was being kinda weird and was flirting with M*** alot. Whatever, even though she says she likes me! Wanna know the best part, I HAVE MOVED ON! I still wanna be friends with S****, but I really like someone new! I will update you all more on that a bit later! Than Tara and Taylor drove me home and Steph forgot her book. I talked to Steph and she thought it was Tara for like ten minutes. It turns out Steph FORGOT HER BAG in Tara's car and wanted Tara to drop it off. But it was gonna be past their curfew so they couldn't. It's not Tara's fault, but it's not steph's fault either! I gg thought! ~Andy Joke Of The Moment: What did Hellen Keller say to my mom? "Hey Judy"!

        I'm gonna be RICH!  Hey~ Okay, So guess what, I was driving with my dad and had a feeling! It was the best feeling in the entire world. I knew that if I bought some Powerball tickets, I would win the lottery! So I made my dad buy a few tickets. It gets verified that I won at 9:59...only 40 minutes to go! I don't know why, but I just have a feeling that I will win. I am SO excited! I have everything ARRANGED PERFECTLY! $500,000 Goes to Charity. $500,000 goes to my personal spending. With that $500,000...I will buy a new car and a Sony Lap Top. I will also put a spiral staircase in my room leading up to a third floor which I will be adding. The third floor will have a movie theatre, my master bedroom, my master bathroom, an office, a sitting room and a hot tub. The other $4,200,000 will go into a savings account. I will gain 5% every year giving me around $230,000 a year for the rest of my entire life!  Derek doesn't think I'm gonna win, but he is just a doubter. If by some weird chance I don't win than it was a glitch. Something went wrong and fait was cursed by some evil person, probably Derek! Atleast Matt believes me! He will be the first to ride in my Porsche 911 Turbo! ~Andy Feeling Of The Moment: GREED!

        FUCK  Hey~ FUCK! The only word I can fathom. Why is life so unfair. I got one thing going great for me, but at the same time another aspect of my life is shitty. I am sorry Im so bussy. I don't mean to never be available. Its just sometimes all the drama catches up with me. Everyone knows itAcTiNgChIcK25: my dear we have some very dramatic friends. I just need/ed some time with my Edina friends. I am not saying they are superior to any of you I am saying it is just a nice break. It' annoying when people get mad for being bussy but than hang out with like two people in the group. It annoys me how certain people are all best friends. You guys are all my best friends but I don't have a best friend. Steph has WG's, Tara has Thomas, Thomas has Matt, Matt has Derek...etc. I don't have a TRUE best friend at stages, but I do have a few at Edina. I am sorry! ~Andy Feeling Of The Moment: Frusterated
