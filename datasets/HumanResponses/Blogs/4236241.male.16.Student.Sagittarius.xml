       In every relationship there will always be screwups.  Your partner or yourself might screw up something really big.  But if u think bout what would you want your partner 2 do if you had screwed up like this.  Probably you would want a second chance.  So loosen up a little, your partner is the love of your life.  So give em a second chance 2 redeem themselves. =).

       Ah communication one of the most important things in any relationship. Learn 2 talk 2 ur partner, risk fights if u have 2 just 2 get the two of you 2 talk things out. Remember fights are not always bad if a couple can fight and love each other after that then that's the kind of relationship that will last. But failure 2 talk 2 your partner about problems will eventually build up and cause more problems and more problems and that will come back 2 haunt you when both people explode. Then those fights will cost you a relationship and much pain afterwards.

       Ok u got a bf thats head over heels for u.  He does whatever u say and tries 2 do whatever he can 2 keep u happy, awesome.  After a while ur used 2 ur goddess treatment so what do u do.  U either appreciate him and in that case perfect.  But most times its not the case, you start taking advantage of his "head over heels for u" bit and u kinda make him do whatever YOU want.  Reality check ladies just cause we're "Head over heels" for u doesn't mean we are your slaves.  We only do it because we love you so don't abuse it.  Treat us like your opposite half.  Give us love.  Treat us with respect.  Don't make a joke outta us so you and your best friends can get a good laugh cuz 1 of these days we're gonna explode and you're gonna be the 1's suffering.

        Relationships need courage.  The courage 2 stand up 2 something thats not right.  The courage 2 take responsibility, the courage 2 admit 2 your lover that you are wrong. the courage 2 reflect on what you did wrong and learn from it and the courage 2 be forgiving.  Not saying u should always take the blame but have at least the courage not 2 always blame your partner in the relationship for everything that goes wrong.  Sometimes reflect on what you did wrong first, maybe its something you did wrong that triggered ur partners reaction in a negative way.  The courage 2 stand up this is mostly directed at the female counterpart in a relationship.  Guys get addicted 2 sex and so do some females but eventually the female wants no more and thats the time u stand up and tell ur male counterpart no more enough is enough.  Forgiveness is a crucial part in any relationship, and having the courage 2 do it will get u places with your partner.

        Love is a very innocent thing, keep it that way, don't ruin it by putting 2 much into the physical stuff...not saying its not important but u can live without the physical stuff, but the emotional stuff is just more important, without the emotional stuff relationships dun last. The physical stuff wears out and after a while its boring, just like an old sweater u've worn over and over again. But the emotional stuff changes day after day always different its like everyday u get a new sweater.
