      Broken this fragile thing now And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces And I've thrown my words all around But I can't, I can't give you a reason  I feel so broken up And I give up I just want to tell you so you know  Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go, but there's just no one no one like you You are my only, my only one   Made my mistakes, let you down  And I can't, I can't hold on for too long  Ran my whole life in the ground  And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone  And something's breaking up  I feel like giving up I won't walk out until you know   Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go, but there's just no one no one like you You are my only my only one  Here I go so dishonestly Leave a note for you my only one  And I know you can see right through me  So let me go and you will find someone  Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go, but there's just no one no one like you You are my only, my only one  My only one  You are my only, my only one

      I can see what's happening..  (What?)  And they don't have a clue.  (Who?)  They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line..    Our trio's down to two.    (Oh.)   Ze sweet caress of twilight; There's magic everywhere.. And with all this romantic atmosphere.. Disaster's in the air!  - Can you feel the love tonight, The peace the evening brings? The world, for once,  in perfect harmony  With all it's living things. -  So many things to tell her; But how to make her see: The truth about my past.. Impossible! She'd turn away from me.  He's holding back, he's hiding But what, I can't decide. Why won't he be the king I know he is, The king I see inside?  - Can you feel the love tonight, The peace the evening brings? The world, for once, in perfect harmony With all it's living things.  Can you feel the love tonight? You needn't look too far.. Stealing through the night's uncertainties, Love is where they are. -   And if he falls in love tonight..  It can be assumed: His carefree days with us are history;  In short, our pal is doomed!

      Already the 3rd day in school and I have to do homework. Grade Seven is totally different from Grade 6. It's like we skipped a whole chapter.  Our batch is the first to study Muslim Maths in the history of Assumption. Woohoo. That means more things for us to study. (Mr. Ramos stinks!! Literally.)  I'll write tomorrow.. Sleepyness at 9pm.

        Stranger than your sympathy     This is my apology     I'm killing myself from the inside out     And all my fears have pushed you out     &nbsp;  I wish for things that I don't need   All I wanted   And what I chase won't set me free   All I wanted   And I get scared but I'm not crawling on my knees    &nbsp;  Everything's all wrong   Everything's all wrong    Where the hell&nbsp;did I think I was?     &nbsp;  Stranger than your sympathy   I take these things so I don't feel    I'm killing myself from the inside out    Now my head's been filled with doubt    &nbsp;  It's hard to live the life you choose   All I wanted   When all your luck's run out of you   All I wanted   You can't see when all your dreams are coming true    &nbsp;  It's easy to forget   You choke on the regrets    Who the hell did I think I was?       &nbsp;  Stranger than your sympathy   All these thoughts you stole from me   I'm not sure where I belong   Nowhere's home and I'm all wrong      &nbsp;  And I wasn't all these things   I tried to make believe I was   And I wouldn't be the one to kneel   Before the dreams I wanted   And all the talk and all the lies   Were all the empty things disguised as me    &nbsp;   Stranger than your sympathy

        I look into your eyes     and it's just a grey and empty sky     Like nothing ever mattered       &nbsp;   There's nothing I can say to make you stay behind     You'd rather be talking&nbsp;with someone else     Like there's somewhere you'd rather be     As long as I'm nowhere to be seen       &nbsp;   I just try so hard to see that smile that makes me whole     The one that makes me feel invincible     Like there's nobody else around me and you     I try but I fail and there's nothing I can change it       &nbsp;   No wonder

      SPEEDING LIVES -Author Censored- 06.20.04  06.15.04 Wow, an angel. I could not believe my eyes. This girl, this woman who has entered the creaking doors of the air-conditioned classroom is my classmate. Her brain and beauty has made her one the popular girls around. We could say the epitomy of your fantasies and dreams of "chinita" women. Ironic, we are already in college and it feels like a high school thing! How sad... She has made me a poet once more. Poetry was never happy because only sorrow can have me paint words beautifully.  06.17.04 And once again she’s my classmate, but this time it is different. She transferred seats! I was so happy because this time around our distance apart has been cut to half. It made my heart race and my fantasies vivid and colorful. The infatuation levels are off the charts! My heart aches with content as I await her smile.  06.22.04 Man, this is making me so depressed. To be so close yet so distant... I better stop this. Nothing is going to flourish from this. There is simply no future. It is just an infatuation and raging hormones that I should just ignore. I suppose it will wear out anyway after a couple of weeks. I probably only got excited with the fact that this "Dream Girl" I keep on seeing became my classmate and it gave me false hope. Moving on is a good thing. That which does not kill me makes me stronger.  06.25.04 ... I was crossing the main road outside our school, and then to my surprise, she was walking alongside with me! Of course we weren’t really friends, but we smiled at each other as if she acknowledged that I was a friend. I was so happy... and then.  CRASH.  Next thing I knew she was on the road, her face still bright and angelic, yet unconscious. She was bleeding like hell, and nobody really tried to help her.   Nobody.  People ran away, and oddly bystanders were... non-existent. Where were the onlookers when you needed them? The panicked driver sped away but not to worry because I got his plate number so he better be ready for pain. Rule of thumb was to not move the body right? But then I felt something inside of me, saying that I have to move her, to carry her, to bring her to the hospital. Something or someone compelled me to lift her from the ground and to bring her somewhere safe and warm. Good thing she was still alive when I was able to bring her to the nearest hospital.  "And you are her brother? Husband?" The nurse asked. All that came out from my mouth was, "Classmate."  They said I made the right decision. She was bleeding heavily after the impact, hemorrhage in the head or something... everything was so blurry but the fact that she, the being I consider untouchable and unreachable, is now in a room next to mine, being operated on or whatever.  Her parents thanked me. They were so grateful for the risk I took when I rushed her to a hospital. We had dinner altogether which was fun and very fulfilling, if the circumstances were only different. It was like instant introduction of a boyfriend to the family. A "meet the parents" thing that fortunately was fun and informative. They fell in love with me, and I fell in love with them that quick. Once again I just hope the circumstances were different.  They said that if I wanted something, I should ask them without any apprehension. And that I can visit her any time.  06.26.04 I was informed that she is still in critical condition. Even if my gamble paid off, the only thing I did was delay the inevitable. She had lost a lot of blood and chances are still slim that she would live through the weekend.  I thought that I should visit her before I do my studies. Her mother was there, right beside her. I figured that this was the time to tell her what I thought about her and so on. I had to take advantage even for just five minutes. I asked her if I could talk to her daughter alone, and she granted my wish. So there, I was there, it was 3:00 p.m.  So there I saw where her mother sat, and then I held her hand. It was magic and tragedy all at the same time. Such a painful paradox...  Her face was still the same, like nothing had happened to her the other day. She only looked as if she were sleeping the day off. But then shortly thereafter suddenly you will hear beeps and air going through some mechanisms as if you were in a factory. All types of medicines being taken intravenously and that life thing, I think it is called the electroencephalogram.  I was there, her mother was just seated somewhere near the door of the room, watching TV. It was then I started my piece.   I’ll be honest and straightforward since you won’t be hearing this anyway, I think. I like you. Yeah, like every male entity in this land who has the same taste as mine. Most people only see you as a trophy girl though… take my word for it because I know. But then I see something in you that I don’t see in most people. There is this something that I cannot discern. I will try but you will have to bear with me on this one… but what can you do, you’re just there, and I am here, and you will have to listen to every word I have to say. I am not saying I am the greatest person, or the perfect guy for you, but then I am so glad that I have this opportunity to tell you how I feel for you and what I think of you. I just hope that the circumstances were ways different! This wasn’t exactly what I had in mind you know. But then anyway I hope that you get better, and I hope that we would also get to know each other more. I would love to be your friend if not anything else, because you are indeed a genuine person. How do I know this? It is because of your smile. Never did I see a smile so pure, so genuine and honest. Please live, for your family, for your friends! I am pretty content being your savior here, or so they say, and with this pouring of my feelings to you, I feel as if I have been so blessed already. I should have prepared for this! I would love to cross the street with you again if you know what I mean… I am not expecting anything else, I think holding your hand is already harassment! I am kidding! Anyway you take care, and go do your thing.   Yeah they said she was in a coma so I thought this would be the perfect time to actually say what I want to say. So I did right? Yes and something shocking really happened…  She held back...  It was a gesture of acceptance, of "I hear you." It was like she heard everything I was saying. Nothing else but her hand moving, and I was so happy that she was able to listen to me. I felt that she was on her way to a speedy recovery because she heard me.  And then that life thing, it flat lined.    She flat lined.    She was gone.  On that very instant everything was a blur once more.   What if I had asked her to live for me...?

       You got to leave me now, you got to go alone  You got to chase a dream, one that's all your own   Before it slips away   When you're flyin' high, take my heart along  I'll be the harmony to every lonely song  That you learn to play   When you're soarin' through the air   I'll be your solid ground  Take every chance you dare  I'll still be there  When you come back down     I'll keep lookin' up , awaitin' your return  My greatest fear will be that you will crash and burn  And  I won't feel your fire   I'll be the other hand that always holds the line  Connectin' in between your sweet heart and mine  I'm strung out on that wire   And I'll be on the other end, To hear you when you call   Angel, you were born to fly, If you get too high  I'll catch you when you fall     Your memory's the sunshine every new day brings   I know the sky is calling Angel, let me help you with your wings   When you're soarin' through the air  I'll be your solid ground  Take every chance you dare    I'll still be there  When you come back down   Take every chance you dare,  I'll still be there  When you come back down
