        Yeah, I set up this blog so Heather would be happy...she better be! lol Well, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to put in this thing...Today I woke up really early at 8:37. I missed the sunrise by like 2 hours. I went to the hospital place to wait for my grandfather, but it turns out we didn't need to be there that early. So my little sister and I went back to his house and chilled then we picked him up around 1. Then I went home and took a nap.....big suprise lol. And now I'm bored and frustrated....argh...Why don't guys call when they say they are going to? Matt finally called me yesterday, but only because Heather yelled at him a lot (thanks Heather!! lol). We&nbsp;talked for a few minutes then he was like, "I've gotta change, I'll call you back later and &nbsp;we'll talk." Then I talked to Chris later that day and he&nbsp;asked if Matt called&nbsp;me and&nbsp;I told him yes and he was like "good, he's been meaning to call you for a few days, he just kept getting drunk and forgetting." &nbsp;lol Gee, thanks I feel special.&nbsp;Yeah....and Matt hasn't called&nbsp;back...Stupid 19 year olds... oh, well &nbsp;lol. But other than that, my life's been good...I'm going to California Friday, so that should be fun...And sorry if I've bored you reading this....and I'm sure I have, because I just read over it and I was pretty bored...How sad lol

       Yesterday I went to Home Depot. Wow did I get strange looks lol...I was looking for nails. Sort of...Actually I went to see if I could find any hott guys and home Deopt seemed like a good place to start. But I really did need nails. I walked and it seemed like every guy (there weren't too many girls) in there that I passed looked at me like I was lost lol. It took me like 1o minutes to find the nail section (is that what it's called?) and then I decided there were way too many and I wasn't properly educated to make an informed decision. However, I did see a couple cute guys, so it's all good. Today I went to buy speakers to go with my CD player/ stereo thing in my car, and its all going to be installed tomorrow...So by like 10 tomorrow night I will be completely broke but rocking out lol. And then I talked to Heather about an hour ago. I haven't seen her or Chris in forver!! (hi Chris!) Matt drove by me today, but he didn't see me. Oh, and I've decided that I need to go to THE In 'N' Out (the one math hottie works at)....you know, just to see if he got hotter..If you wanna go with me let me know *cough Steph!! *cough...I can't believe we go back to school in 11 days. It'll be fun to see everyone again but the actual school part is going to suck...oh, well...at least I'll be able to drive there....and maybe I'll be taller than some of the freshman...No, wait, nevermind that lol...Speaking of shortness (jk!!) I saw Michelle today! Hi Michelle! lol....And now I'm listening to music....Phonebooth by Death Cab for Cutie is an awesome song...in case you were wondering lol

       Ok....well...Yesterday was ok, although it was boring. I did get hit on by some guys at a stop light which made me laugh. lol...It still does make me laugh. Today we went to see Princess Diaries 2 but in the middle of the movie the film like melted. It was so werid, and they couldn't fix it so we have to go see it again tomorrow...thats ok, cause the guy in the movie is really hott lol. Then I went driving around and it started to rain a little bit...and I was like "Oh, shiznit!" (I had the top down) but thankfully it stopped.  And now I'm just talking to people. (Heather, I hope you have a better day tomorrow! and we'll hang out after your "groundation" is over!)

      Well, let's see....Monday I went to lunch with Heather, Chris, Matt and this other girl. It was, uh, interesting listening to Matt talk about all of his "girls"...but it made me think. I have no idea whats "poppin" between us (to quote Chris). Oh,well... Then I got to meet Will!! (GO HEATHER!! He's cool!) We all hung out at Starbucks and that was fun...cause they're fun people. Later I watched the first part of Top Gun....Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer....mmmmm lol Then I went to Jamba Juice with Steph, Emily and Amber. Today I didn't really do much. I drove around a lot...but what else is new? lol I pulled into a shopping center to answer my cell phone and when I was leaving it, 4 hott cross country guys from our school ran by me. One of them was like "Nice car". I wanted to say "Nice bod" but I just said "Thanks" instead lol. Yeah...thats about it.

        Somebody yelled at me when I was driving...and it wasn't nice yelling lol. I wonder what I did wrong...Oh, well...Wednesday was my birthday, and I hung out with Steffie. I baby-sat on Friday and Saturday from like 5-1...So I'm tired of baby-sitting! lol It wasn't that bad, though and I make some serious cash, so its all good. I bought what I thought was the new Maroon 5 CD, but it was an acoustic version of their songs. Oops...It's still good, though lol. And I went to  Best Buy to buy a stereo for my car, but they said that since my car is a convertible and sits in the sun, the dash will most likely crack. Argh...I don't need a dash anyway lol. Now I'm talking to Heather cause she's finally back from California. (I'm so glad you're date went well cause you  rule!) Dangit...I was going to wash my car since its after 7, but now it's too dark...Last time I washed my car in the dark it looked worse than when it wasn't washed.     Hmm...I really should update this more often, because I'm not sure what else happened this week...

        Well I called Matt last night because he said to call him when I got back from California. He was at his cousins house and told me he'd call be back when he got back on this side of town. I haven't heard from him yet. Hmmm...lol But I know if he ever does call he'll make some excuse and I'll just be like, "Oh, its cool.", even though it isn't...Argh. Maybe I'll have to go back to Sunset Station and take that drunk guy up on his offer...or not lol. Today was pretty boring, I cleaned a lot, and then drove around. Some guy talked to me at a stop light, which was really odd. And then I watched Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights...it was ok, but the first one is way better. Now I'm just talking to people and listening to The Killers...exciting, yes, i know.

      lol if the title doesn't make sense thats ok, its an inside joke. I went to California this weekend, that was fun. It's weird seeing people you haven't seen in like 4 years...but cool lol. And I'm thinking about putting lights under my car...Anybody know if thats legal here? lol just kidding...I don't need yet another reason for the cops to pull me over...But yeah, today we drove home. Six hours in a car...what fun! lol But I drove for like 30 miles on the actual Interstate freeway and I didn't crash!! ( For those of you who are confused, I was freaked out because I've only been on the freeway like 3 times before) Then I took a shower and drove around a lot. There was this really hott guy on the other side of the gas pump when I went to the gas station. He was like an Abercrombie-model uber-hottie...but he was old lol. But the n I was leaving and this guy waved to me, so I waved back...that was weird lol..Then I drove around and went home...And here I am.
