      when u think of harry potter and the lord of the rings if u've read either of those books well then u'll go either, theyre good or they suck. And u leave it at that.  I've been reading tho, ever since harry potter has come out and lotr has been made into movies, about ppl who seem to think that   Hp + LotR  -----------&nbsp; = Something satanical  religion   i mean seriously, ppl get a life! First of all, there is absolutely nothing satanical about these books! geez! harry potter is especially persecuted (because well jrr tolkien was a strong catholic -so forget lotr-)  but saying that:   1) it goes against the principles of god and religion  -come on!, these ppl only say this because god is not at all mentioned in the harry potter books, nor is religion mentioned, but&nbsp;this is a fantasy book not a bible and those ppl will realize that if it does not talk about god it doesnt talk about god being non-existent or evil or whatever, either; it doesnt give people ideas. And they say that because it talks about magic it goes against all principles of religion, well o dearie me pardon me, wasnt jesus' miracles like magic for those who saw them? besides every kid&nbsp; thinks about what the world would be like if something magical happened once in a while, so should we ban kids from society then? or punish them? of course not!   2) it promotes satan worshipping&nbsp; -  and at this point i laughed so much because this did not make any sense. I have seen hide nor hair of anything relating to satan worshipping in the harry potter books (maybe reading the book backwards tells u to worship satan !*gasp*). seriously, there is evil in this book because theyre has to be (where would a book go without a bit of evil) and in case these ppl havent noticed so far the GOOD side always wins. so ha! now even if there is voldemort -which is pretty much the closest thing to satan in the books- u will notice that way more ppl are against him then with him.. and the ppl against him are good do i need to spell it out for u? G-O-O-D, they are brave, smart ppl who do anything to protect the ppl they love (now would anyone tell me, does satan help the ppl he loves? nooooooo he doesnt love anybody and im pretty much sure that he wouldnt bother being brave and GOOD either, not too mention the fact that satan most likely doesnt exist because he has never manifested himself.) Come off it! Kids get more bad ideas about the world and life and satan IN SCHOOL THAN BY READING HARRY POTTER!!!!! well then lets ban schools shall we?   3) it promotes  -what was it the guy said-  the occult  -something like that-  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; riggggghtt. so basically what hes saying is, it promotes people doing witchcraft. uh huh. now, does anyone see little kids truly believing that they are a witch or wizard and actually, seriously, as tho their life depended on it, saying latin spells and levitating things? no. besides even if they tried to, how many times would it work eh? like none; it definitely would not work. &nbsp;and i think that the rest of us who arent little kids and who happen to be much smarter and knowledgable than they are,&nbsp;know that witchcraft ''like what harry potter does'' is entirely fictual and not at all dangerous in real life.&nbsp;   And so i ask where the hell do u see these books having a negative impact on someone? have u seen it on the news? -like a teenage boy&nbsp; killing somebody and saying; well he tried to curse me OR i killed him because he said harry potter sucked-&nbsp; erm, no, ok? no.  if kids are actually reading and taking the time to let their imagination take a spin isnt that a good thing? i think that parents who consider these books harmful to their children are parents who try to swallow their children up into their own world and not let them be independent. if anything, harry potter promotes the idea&nbsp;that good is better than ''evil'' and that those who join the ''evil'' side will get nothing good of it ( look at wormtail). There&nbsp;are more evil and satanic things on the eleven oclock news (what with murders and gang drug dealings) than in the harry potter books. so get a life and read it and then tell me if u believe that neville is promoting satan worshipping or if perhaps hermione or professor mcgonagall&nbsp; are.   and might i add that nobody (not even normal little kids -those who have reached sufficient intelligence and not those who&nbsp;believe absolutely everything including that there are monsters under the bed-)&nbsp;believe that harry potter is real anyways so there is nothing they can do to imitate him or get in contact with him or whatever.   &nbsp;

      Original title eh?   anyways, well im kinda new to the whole blog thing, i&nbsp;usually stay away from those and quitely surf my usual sites; i have quite&nbsp;a selection of those&nbsp;heh. I'm on the com today cuz my tv busted (it might be cuz they cut the cable cuz&nbsp;were moving in like 3 days: &nbsp;so *poof* no more cable), and so without television one must resort to the computer.   anyways with&nbsp;that little introduction out of the way, let us proceed&nbsp;to more important things. The fact&nbsp;that life is really a whole bunch of sour candies, i mean sometimes its really too much and&nbsp;at times its nice and enjoyable. some ppl are allergic to living out their life (so u&nbsp;could say they hate sour candies) and others just try to make the best out of it.  i remember once i ate a&nbsp;whole bunch of those super sour cherries candies and the day after my tongue felt really weird and then during gym class i&nbsp;felt like a piece of skin hanging off my tongue&nbsp;and im like&nbsp;showing my gym teacher (''miss is there something on my tongue'') and she was like ''ewwww wat did u do?! i think u should go see the nurse!'' turns out i had burnt the taste buds&nbsp; on the top of my tongue&nbsp; because of the&nbsp;sour-ness of the candies ( and the&nbsp;quantity i ate) and the skin had turned white and was peeling off, needless to say it was&nbsp;totally gross and really not enjoyable&nbsp;(and the moral of this&nbsp;story is,&nbsp;''dont eat too many sour candies&nbsp;at one time.'' OR ''the point of life is too take it in, not to drown in it'' -in otherwords take it slow, live it one day at a time and dont overload urself-).   S'all for now dudes and dudettes  have&nbsp; nice day

      turning 16 soon! how cool is that? 16 is the age that everything seems to start at... i mean; i got no curfew, i might start drivin, i feel like partying alot more, i am no longer scared of sec 4's!! (like i was in sec 1) ill start workin this summer etc. i mean, this year is the year of no limits! its my year! thats what i've decided.  its time to pump up my self confidence, pump up my music and drive myself a style; "bref'' be who i wanna be. no more being influenced. no more pretendin, no more hating myself, no more following rules (well alright ill still follow rules). this year i am all smiles, it is the year of change haha!  i mean i've been in a shell since i was a kid, never wanting to bother anybody, never wanting to get on the wrong side of someone, always making compromises and contradiciting myself> hopefully that'll change, cuz i want it to. for sure it'll take time. but this year im figuring out who i am and was meant to be.  seriously, how many ppl in high school act as though living is torture? well as far as i know, alot. i mean ya, its hard, ya u sometimes just wanna chuck evrything down the drain and forget it. ah well, tears are part of living and feeling arent they? where would we all be if none of us could cry or feel sad or guilty? we'd all have turned murderers by now. and tip to the guys; what the hell is it with keeping everything inside?!?!?!? u'll explode! i know this is an extreme example but seriously, u know why there are more male killers out there? cuz they keep all the stuff inside ur head, in any case thats wat i think, some poor man gone crazy with all the pressure and the stress and the sadness that he kept inside that he goes and kills his wife and kids. i told u it was an extreme example but its true.  so i wanna change. cool. and good. change is good. in some cases. i think i was always afraid of change, i like routine but routine becomes boring after a while and henceforth change needs to happen. i dont like surprises, well not the ones where someone goes hey i have a surprise for you and tells u they wont tell u wat is it and itll be like next week, thats annoying. but i think everybody needs to be surprised once in a while especially if they're feeling down; a nice little surprise from their friends nothing big like a chocolate bar or a flower (one u picked urself) or even just saying how much ppl care about them.   so i dunno if any of this is good advice, but to me it sounds like thats how u gotta live ur life. tho the problem is if i can sometimes say smart things and give advice, i cant take it. ''do wat i say not wat i do'' i guess i need to change that as well.  and the sad part is that all i said right here i will most likely forget and go back to my old self, lol but i will remember one day. lol and theres always a possibility that i wont forget and will lead a better life...i'll see once i get there.  summers nearly over! so everybody make the last summer days nice and sweet!
