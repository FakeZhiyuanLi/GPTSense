      im in a better mood today..i think its cuz i woke up with a  good  start..everything was makin me mad last night..and i mean everything..guess what?! jakob ruined my warped tour..i cant listen to my warped tour cd..without thinking about him..god dammit.. him and his gross pierced nipples..god damn that was sick..oh well..it'll give me something to guide him by..yah know? that didnt turn out right..but im not going to backspace it cuz ima let you guys  think  about whatever you want..and what i meant by that..and jose..jeez..he sang a song to me last night..and i sang very quietly..so quiet he couldnt hear..not that the fact of him yelling at nina helped..but whatever..it was a rap song..i know it from when i used to listen to that.. "boy i really like..what you've..done to me and i..cant really explain it..i am so into you.." who is that song by? anybody know? anybody at all? whatever..hah hah..i still think about when we went down to the river..and he gave me a rock and he told me to pitch it like a pitch softballs..and i did..cuz he thought it was sexy..and so i did..but..he wasnt watching the rock..and how i pitched it..he was watching something else..jeez..he's such a dude..and when he told me to drink out of the shorter drinking fountain..hah..you probably might not understand that one unless you are a girl, in tight jeans..at the park..with your boyfriend..hah..well i think ima go..call him..i havent talked to him..maybe he's mad me..speaking of that..i think im bipolar..is that a disease? i think it is..uh oh..well.. kishes from the kitty..
