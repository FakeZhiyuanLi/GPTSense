      So I spent today playing with stuff, and the fruit of my labor is  urlLink here . That's right, I made a new blog, but this one is special, cause I'm hosting it myself :)  Yes, MovableType (a blog making engine) is now installed on my linux box, and so is my blog :-D  Sometime soon, when I get a PCI sound card, I'm going to be transplanting computers around. So I'm *hoping* that all my movable type stuff doesn't get deleted, but if it does, I haven't messed with it that much, so it's all good.

       urlLink This woman  posted "what she wants in a man" on her blog... I find the most recent update to the list quite funny (keep in mind, I haven't read the rest of the blog):   "Part XII  I want a big geek.  I don't necessarily mean a computer geek, although those are fun, and it's amusing to think that saying something like, "but I couldn't, because the file extension was .php! hahaha!" is a turnon.  But I like smart guys, I like men who have a clear interest in something, and I really, really like people who have passions - in other words, geeks.  Particularly ones who babble on like crazy about the thing they're into, and then realize they're doing it, laugh about it, and then maybe accidentally do it some more, realize it again, and then talk about something else. Awfully cute."   Links to the rest of the list (I find it quite entertaining):  urlLink Part I  |  urlLink Part II  |  urlLink Part III  |  urlLink Part IV  |  urlLink Part V  |  urlLink Part VIish  |  urlLink Part VII  |  urlLink Part VIII  |  urlLink Part IX  |  urlLink Part X  |  urlLink Part XI   Yes, this lady puts a lot of thought into all of these... hehe

        i’ve totally been undedicated to God lately. the thing i love most in the world, and i can’t even chase after it. i sure can chase after everything else materialistic and worldy. as ecclesiastes says, “a striving after the wind.” my whole life this week has been just that. and for the most part, many of the weeks before that.   - Kevin's Blog    I think it's so easy for us to fall into the path of materialism. Holding the posessions we have in such high honor, rather than understanding that they're not that important, they're things God has blessed us with. I've noticed in my life I tend to do this a bit, but not really that much. I'm pretty content with what I have, I think it comes from not really having that much. Sure, there are things that I would like, but really I'm content with what I have and I don't try to get them very much, and if I do and they're taken away, I'm upset for a bit but get over it (IE: Guitar that I don't get back till next month). However I notice just how much Americans as a whole are materialistic. Wealth and levels of achievement really all depend on how much you have, what you have, and how much it's "worth" (how you can put a worth on things that aren't important is beyond me). Americans seem to think that the way to happiness is through things... that's why if you notice, when Americans go overseas they try to give the people things in hopes that it will make them happier.  Just something I'm pondering.

      Well, I had an interesting Valentine's Day... I didn't really do anything that you would identify as a normal V-Day activity. I woke up early... wrote a poem... was written a poem... and then went out with Brady. No, not in some wrong sense.  Brady came and picked me up around 2:30pm... I wasn't sure of what to wear... well, actually I had just gotten out of the shower a bit earlier and didn't have a shirt on yet. I don't think it's anything Brady hasn't seen, so whatever.  ANYway... we had decided the night before we were going to get a new love interest for him, on a limited budget... the answer was unanimous. He needed a new computer. So, we first went to CompUSA to look at parts... mostly cases and power supplies, but we priced other things as well and decided that Fry's would be a bit cheaper for the rest. So we got a pretty nice case, with blue LED lit collums and a nicely lit power supply as well. Then off to Fry's we headed.  Man... it was raining hard when we got there.  So, we went in and figured out where in the store to get what we wanted, then got the help we needed (they have to make an order thing for it)... so we were talking to the guy and told him we wanted 512 MB of ram (and the kind that allowed for the full 800mHz system bus)..... he started a list of ram on the computer screen... and it looked to us like he was trying to somehow swindle us out of hundreds... but that was explained and yeah... it all worked out. We were about to go up and pay when Brady realized he didn't have the checkbook for the account we were planning to get the stuff on... but it all worked out in the end. So, we got the board in one trip (and oh were we happy), then the processor and ram after a short lunch at McDonald's.  Then we went back to Brady's, for three and a half hours of installation. Oh joy... I live for that stuff, so of course I did it. So, we got in the board, ram, power supply, stickers, drives, and other random cool stuff, and flipped on the switch, and after a little work, it all turned on and looks really cool, and works really well.  So, Brady now has a new computer with a 2.8GHz Pentuim 4 processor with HT, a VERY nice Intel Motherboard with the newest Chipset and onboard gigabit ethernet (along with that 800Mhz Bus! And 512kb Cache!), 512MB of DDR400 Ram, some lights, a nice case, and then an old HD that needs replaced in the not too distant future. The ending cost for this major upgrade? $630... not high at all! And it was fun, so it's all good.  I'm going to go now, putting Debian on the mac....

      Yes... apperantly it happened a few years ago... there's some huge cover up or something going on. Bill Gates is dead... For the full story, check out  urlLink this .  For the full video of the event, check out this:  urlLink small   urlLink large .  Yes, apperantly somebody had way too much time on their hands.... and made the independent film  urlLink "Nothing So Strange" . I don't think Microsoft liked it much.

         Oh yes, my beautiful Linux shell, with beautiful motd   Ok, so right now I'm in a big nerd out phase... due to the fact that I've got a debian system (two really, one on each hard drive) working, and... yeah, I'm having fun playing and learning things on them. So far, I've not done much useful, but there is a webserver running. So, if my computers on, if you head  here  you should be able to see the basic debian "your webserver is working" page. Which is pretty nifty, if you ask me. (right now it's down, because I decided I wanted to reinstall it).  In other news, my PC has yet another interface, and is very pretty (in my opinion):     Pretty Interface

              A novice asked the Master: "Here is a programmer that never designs, documents, or tests his programs.  Yet all who know him consider him one of the best programmers in the world.  Why is this?"         The Master replies: "That programmer has mastered the Tao.  He has gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the system crashes, but accepts the universe without concern.  He has gone beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code.  He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident.  Truly, he has entered the mystery of the Tao."                 -- Geoffrey James, "The Tao of Programming"

      So in my tired state, I wrote a poem and put it on my poetry.com thing... maybe it'll win again and get published like a lot of the others, I doubt it though.    When Sleep is Fleeting    Nothing can describe The way I feel at night A time of cold and darkness But warmed beyond belief By thoughts of you. Thoughts of letters written and paths traveled... prayers said... hopeful hearts. The night becomes a somewhat happy place Where my mind wanders onto happy things. Leaving the problems of the day To meet the bliss, that is meeting you. And when I wake I wonder If it will all turn out this way And again I pray That it will be. But I thank God either way... Here for a moment or here to stay, I thank him for what he's done In bringing us to meet this way.

      "ECC 1:2 "Meaningless! Meaningless!"     says the Teacher.   "Utterly meaningless!     Everything is meaningless.""  Don't ever say that to a parent.... at least if they're like my mom is. I said that and she took my guitar and some stuff and said "Well, if it's meaningless than I guess you won't mind me taking this.... yeah... that stunk. Then the asking for it back, standing in the parking lot while she goes around singing what a loser I am and what a hypocrite I am (because of course, my guitar is not meaningless to me and I wanted it back...)  It's been a tough morning, please pray for me.

      Yeah, this song really gives me a lot of hope right now... cause my mom's pretty much going all at it telling me what a failure I'm going to be and how I'm not going to make anything of myself when I'm older (or just telling me to my face that I am a loser). Maybe she's true, but I take comfort in the fact that the worldly measurment doesn't really matter... I'm not looking to be rich of famous, just looking to follow God wherever he leads me.   Lyricz|  4him - Measure Of A Man  This world can analize and size you up and throw you on the scales They can I.Q. you and run you through Their rigorous details They can do their best to rate you And they'll place you on the charts And then back it up with scientific smarts But there's more to what you're worth Than their human eyes can see Oh, I say the measure of a man Is not how tall you stand How wealthy or intelligent you are 'Cause I've found out the measure of a man God knows and understands For He looks inside to the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines The measure of a man Well, you can doubt your worth And search for who you are And where you stand But God made you in His image When He formed you in His hands And He looks at you with mercy And He sees you through His love You're His child and that will always be enough For there's more to what you're worth Than you could ever comprehend Oh I say the measure of a man Is not how tall you stand How wealthy or intelligent you are   'Cause I've found out the measure of a man God knows and understands For He looks inside To the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines The measure of a man You can spend your life persuing physical perfection There is so much more More than ever meets the eye For God looks through the surface And He defines your worth by what is on the inside I say the measure of a man Is not how tall you stand How wealthy or intelligent you are 'Cause I've found out the measure of a man God knows and understands For He looks inside To the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines Oh, I say the measure of The measure of a man Is not how tall you stand, How wealthy or intelligent you are Oh, I've found the measure of a man God knows and understands it For He looks to the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines Yeah, what's in the heart defines Yeah, what's in the heart defines The measure of a man I know, I know   As  much as things at home hurt... make me want to cry(well, I am crying) or leave or just end it all... I take comfort in the fact that the Lord loves me no matter how much I screw up, and he's there for me no matter how far I stray. Well, I try to at least.... truly, it is hard.

      Look at my Archives....   Well, after about a year of Blogging, I've decided to start anew. Since I'm trying a lot lot lot harder to live my life in a way that glorifies God, I figured my blog ought to show that.  I'm not perfect, I'm a sinner, and I appologize deeply to those I've hurt... and continued hurting through things I've posted in the past.  I'm sincerely appologizing to anyone I've ever hurt... and hoping that you can all manage to forgive me. Right now, I want to put the past in the past... and start again. New Beginnings.... those are wonderful things. It's true for school, and it's true for life.  Right now, I really feel that the song Ocean Floor, by Audio Adrenaline, really applies.  The mistakes i've made  that cause pain  i couldve done without  oh my selfish thoughts  oh my pride  the things i...  you have forgotten about   they're all behind you  they'll never find you  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  of the ocean floor   My misdeeds  oh my greive  the things that harm me now  they're not a pretty site to see  but they wipe away  by a mighty, mighty wave...mighty, mighty wave   they're behind you  they'll never find you  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are erased  and they are no more  they're out on the ocean floor   take them away...  to return no more...  take them away...  to the ocean floor...to the ocean floor...   they're all behind you  they'll never find you  they're on the ocean floor...  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  all on the ocean floor  your sins are erased  they are no more  they're out on the ocean floor  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are erased and  they are no more  they're on the ocean floor...    And for that, I am very happy. The wounds I have caused will heal... God will provide for those people.  In that sense, this blog is hopefully going to become a lot less about me, and more about God and what he's doing... though I may throw in a little bit about things going on recently... just a few personal updates... but nothing near what it was before.  So, with that, I'm going to end this post.

      You're probably wondering why I'm posting here again, and not on my personal hosted blog. Well at the moment I'm doing a major overhaul of my netowork infrastructure (IE: I'm installing a router), and I was forced to remove my blog for the computer I normally host it on... I'm thinking about backing up the databases though, not really sure.... I think I will.  Therefore I should still be able to get it back up and running quite quickly.

      "For as long as I shall live I will testify to love I'll be a witness in the silences when words are not enough With every breath I take I will give thanks to God above For as long as I shall live I will testify to love"  I love that song...  I also love punk music I have discovered. I've been listening to New Found Glory, Yellowcard (I love ANYTHING from Ocean Street), and MxPx.

      My Pastor's Daughter Nicole has been diagnosed with cancer in her lymph nodes. They removed one yesterday and don't know if it'd malignant yet, but they think it is so she'll most likely be stuck in chemotherapy. I'm so glad that she's close to Sherrie (my Youth Leader's wife), as Sherrie went through cancer earlier in her life too. Please be praying for her and her family in this hard time.

      Hotmail and Yahoo hate eachother, and thus I hate both of them. Google seems to be the only one who's email service doesn't suck in some way or another.  I've had two emails to yahoo addresses sent from my Hotmail account come back "This message has been delayed", and it's really getting on my nerves.  Other than that... lets see here.  Oh, last night at the fair was fun! I left work at my normal time and went out to Katy's and we just hung around until other people came (Katie was there too)... then we all hung around for a while longer and finally went to the fair. Marjen came so some of us (the ones who didn't want to ride rides) went to meet her while the rest of the people went to do their thing. Umm... then we went to Burgerville and got some food and then we hung out for more time at the fair. I dunno, the fair is cool n' all but gets old fast. I like the tractors though, I could play on the tractors for like hours...  After the fair we all went back to Katy's house and watched Signs in the dark. It wasn't really too creepy, and I discovered I can make the clicking sound the aliens make (it freaks Katy out).  I got home around 1:30am yet still managed to wake up for work this morning... somehow.  I was going to go to a party tonight but I think I will skip it so I'm better able to plan for the weekend... yeah. I could probably get it so my mom would let Sarah come over, but I'm gonna see about going out there and then I'll do the stuff and maybe she can come over next weekend... it'd be cool if we could keep her overnight and bring her to Church again on Sunday too.  Yeah... I'm like killer tired.        On an occaision of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one's mind. It becomes a pleasure. - Oscar Wilde, from The Importance of Being Earnest

      Sarah! Read the comment I posted http://stupendoussteve.blogspot.com/2004/07/on-today-and-possibly-tomorrow-and.html#comments   The email I sent you was "delayed", stupid Hotmail.    My Mom gave me a list of things to do and then you  could  come over, I won't be able to get them done by tomorrow, but maybe you can come out here next weekened. That'd be cool :)

           It's almost this slow...     Today has been a really slow day. It's sad when you wish that a server would crash or a hacker would decide your company looks up for the picking, anyway due to the lack of activity I decided to write a blog post. It gives me a chance to close my eyes and let my fingers do the typing... yes, I really do type blog posts with my eyes closed, so if I start randomly saying what I'm dreaming, don't blame me.  Anyway, on today. Yeah nothing too much going on. I didn't want to get up this morning, I was so tired. Sarah and her family got home last night so I stayed up iuntil like 12:30 talking to her cause it's been so long. It was nice to talk, I've missed it. The phone company was stupid and never sent us a phone bill, so they turned off our phone for the moment. My mom's going (or more likely already gone) to go in and yell at them about it today.  After work today I'm going to Katy's and we're like watching a movie until other people come and then everyone's going to the fair. It'll be neat but I'm not riding any rides or spending any money cause I'm broke and don't feel like mooching... I hope people don't decide to go out to eat.  On Friday my boss comes back from his camping trip, he'll find everything almost exactly the same as when he left, which may not sound like a good thing but it is, cause it means I'm not fired.      Saturday... I'm hoping to go to Sarah's on Saturday since we haven't seen eachother for so long. It's not a guarenteed thing but it'd be really nice if I could do. I'll have to check with my mom if it's ok to spend the night cause they've mentioned in the past that it's easier on them and I agree... and I'm not really in a position to complain about them allowing me to spend the night (as if I would complain). I'm hoping to go cause that'd be really awesome... even though I don't have her anniversary present yet (I'm getting it next week!). Also next week I am getting my surround sound speakers and the sound card for my computer, and the optical drives. After that there will only be the two video cards and the three monitors... and of course the desk, and then it will be complete. Fun fun.  I believe that's all I have to say for now, I'll post sometime in the future.

      This is the best mousepad... ever:     I'm more likely to get this one though (because my computer's so droolable):     Maybe I'll get this Instead:     If you go  urlLink here , I want almost everything on there (lol)... and of course my HackerHat

      Man, today I met our resident graphics cool dude... and he's Australian!!! He had a mouse problem (that I fixed quickly thankfully) and yeah, he needed some help. I love their accents, I bet he's popular with the ladies... no really, I bet he is.  I wish I was Australian. Not cause I want to be popular with ladies, one is enough, but it'd be cool to have that accent. Maybe when I'm older I'll move there so my kids get the accent, you know, living my dreams through them.

      So… events of the past day or so.  First off, as I mentioned yesterday, Sarah called. That was really cool, made me pretty happy, even though we only talked for like 7 minutes. She’s back late Wednesday night, so I hopefully can see her again soon (it’s been like 2.5 weeks since I’ve seen her).  Last night I was up pretty late talking to a girl on the phone that has a lot of crap going on in her life and was going to use the wrong way out. It was kinda creepy cause I could hear the pill bottles and stuff as she tried opening them. In the end she was going to call a help center and see a counselor, I’m going to call later today and check up on how that went… man, guys don’t realize how much they can ruin a girl’s life… and truly ruin it. This girl wasn’t heartbroken by a guy (well, plural), but yeah… worse. Guys can be pigs.  Yesterday what else…. Oh yeah! So on Saturday this person sent me an email saying “I have interesting pictures of your beautiful girlfriend and one of her guy friends. Wanna see?”, that was kinda odd, so I said yes. Sure enough Sunday they sent me links to some pictures Jeannette took of Sarah hanging out with some of her friends. One was in the pool and her friend was being goofy, and the other was a group picture where she was “standing so close to him”, I guess those were supposed to get me upset but yeah, it didn’t work. I still have no idea who the person that emailed me was though, very interesting…  Today is yet another Monday. I like Mondays right now, other than the fact that I’m always tired. They really aren’t so bad, I mean think about it… it’s a Monday, but if work started on Tuesdays then everyone would hate Tuesdays, so I don’t see the problem. Today my boss is going to be there for a little bit (maybe), and then I’m on my own for the week. I hope nothing drastically blows up (hmm… yes I do hope this).  Woo, more computer parts should be coming today! Unless FedEx is stupid. Which they may be, you never know.

      Mmmm... nothing going on. Life's very bland recently.  Brianna called me last night which was cool 'cause we haven't talked for a while. I think she called me some other time recently but I don't quite remember. We were talking about how laid back I am... I suppose it's pretty true.  laid-back (ldbk) adj. Informal  Having a relaxed or casual atmosphere or character; easygoing: “laid-back, untroubled people”  Yep, that is me, lol. I don't (except for some important things) really take things overly serious, I guess it helps to keep the stress down. I'm getting to wherre I need to take school seriously though, next year is going to be stressful... but livable.  This summer so far has been pretty slow, yet it's gone by quickly (that really doesn't make sense). I'm hoping I can get into the same thing next year, an extra $3000 would be useful.  I put Debian on my work laptop this morning... man, I put Debian on everything I can get my hands on. The first Linux Distro I installed, and by far my favorite. The best part is it works just fine :)

      I must do my greatest thinking on the Max… it’s when my mind is clear and tired at the same time.  Next week is gonna rock. My boss Jeremy is on vacation, so I’m gonna be the head computer guy at the company. Means I’ll have the keys to the server rooms and the storage areas, which will be cool too. Hopefully it’s an easy week and no servers decide to blow up or raid arrays decide that its time to give up on life. Well, Jeremy’s got a pretty good setup, so I’d be surprised if anything other than that happened, because of course hardware failures are next to impossible to forecast.  Wow, someone on the max line has some weird seagulls in their yard, and the girl sitting behind me has really strong perfume, at least it’s a good scent.  I should read the classifieds over the person in front of me’s shoulder… Ooo, a Classic 1972 Ford is selling for only $1675… it may be classic but I bet it’s not worth too much.  -15 Minutes Later-  Ah, now I’m on the bus. Interesting people ride the bus… usually there are quite a few normal people, though at this moment they seem in short supply. Across from me in the seats is a couple… the man looks around 25 or older and the girl looks like she might be 14 (maybe younger?)… kinda sick if you ask me. Now onto the bus come the more “normal” people… the preppy girls (if you can call them normal). All flaunting their looks and smiling if they notice you glancing at them, even if it’s just because you want to write them into your blog post. I feel like Harriet the Spy, that’s kinda cool. I should use my bus rides to work on my descriptions for writing, as there are always new eople I haven’t seen before (in fact I think there’s only two people I’ve even recognized on the bus, I knew neither of them though).  Over in the corner sits a man reading the paper… sports section, of course. He’s most likely a construction worked or the like, his shoes show a quite a bit of wear and hard use, and he’s in need of a shave, or to let it grow. His glasses seem clean enough, as do his clothes, but his hat is a bit outdated (saying “2000 The New Millenium”). The bus driver finally makes his way onto the bus, and the few stragglers that will not get on the bus until the driver is there finally come in. There’s a lady that keeps talking to herself in Chinese it sounds… or maybe she’s speaking in tongues… either way nobody even gives her a second glance. There’s a Spanish guy across from me that has nothing really to mention. He looks like many of the Hispanics in the area, trying to be preppy but not looking the roll in the least. Preppy girls show they have some thought, they’ve slightly turned and are staring at the lady that is holding a conversation with herself… she’s even throwing in hand gestures now, and this guy across from me that looks like an Eminem wannabe mentions she’s doing that because nobody listens to her so she has to talk to herself. The bus stops… an old lady with frizzy white hair comes on, and a guy that looks like he likes football. The crazy lady goes and stands at the front of the bus (still inside, but I'm sitting in the back), and football guy gives her a wide eyed look when she walks past. Now she comes and sits by my laptop case… still talking in her unknown language. Eminem looks like he’s about to burst into laughter… I suppose I can understand that. Construction guy in the corner is leaning against the window sleeping. I would think that hat would be pretty uncomfortable… Eminem starts giggling, says it’s a joke but it’s more likely about the lady talking random nothingness.  This man with a CD player that looks like he could be a software developer, but probably isn’t, mentions my assortment of goodies. Pocket PC, Laptop… I suppose there are some goodies, all I’m missing is a cell phone.  We stop at another stop (by now we’ve passed a few, but nobody of note either entered or left the bus – those preppy girls are probably headed to the mall now that I think about it)… nobody of note gets on. We drive onwards. I notice the laptop battry is at 77%, where it was fully charged before leaving work, yes I think sometime soon this will need replaced. Babbling lady gets up and heads to the front of the bus again, and Eminem gets that dumb grin on his face…. Then she sits in the front next to a woman that would probably rather be somewhere else right now. Looking at football, I can see he’s probably a construction worker too, or a painter (he has some paint on his shorts). His shoes are beat up and he has a hat that says Hansen, but not the band (probably a construction company). He sits up straighter than an arrow, probably was once in the military or something. The old lady with the frizzy hair gets off, leaving babbling woman on her own… I wonder if this was really her stop or if she just needed to get away. I can’t really say which I’d do…  We stop at the bus stop by the old Beaverton City Library… this is usually where a couple hundred Mexicans get on and off the bus, but I guess it’s too early for them to be out. Some guy gets on that looks like a hippie and a biker mixed, with his bandana. He apparently has no idea where he is or what bus he’s on, as the driver talks to him for a while. Eventually he does sit down. I notice we’re passing Denny road, which means there is only Hart before my stop, so I’m going to go now. Hope you enjoy this :)

       urlLink This  is a very sweet music player. Made by Commodore (yes, they ARE still around... at least I think so), so it's got to be awesome.  Speaking of Commodore, and Awesome. Check out  Machinae Supremacy  is a band with a huge download section, and one of the first (or only?) bands to make SiD Metal. That being hard (metal) rock being played along with Commodore 64 SiD Chips. I need to learn how to program my Commodore to play music, all I ever did with it was some symphony out of a book (which of course I quickly put on a disk... which I have since lost).  My days during the week are pretty bland. I get up in the morning (with a bit of trouble recently, I need to sleep more) and go to work... there I do stuff, and sit at my desk, and do stuff there, and then at like 4:30 I go home. Once there I pretty much do the same thing I did at work. It may sound boring, and at times it is, but really I'd be bored just sitting at home all day anyway (and hey, I'm getting payed for this).  Tomorrow Armaan is having a party somtime, I'm not sure when or where (though I'd assume his house). It's likely that I'll take the bus to hart road and walk up to his house from (pretty close to) Adri's, which will be fun and relaxing, and also very warm if weather holds out the way it's been (Man, Sarah must be loving it over in Hawaii... and also getting really burnt).  I've discovered the niceness of headphones at work. I can rock to music off the laptop (which has far superior sound to the PDA) and still umm... "work".  As much as I talk about not working at work, usually I do end up with quite a bit to do. Like the other day I had to change a file in every computer... thankfully I can do that over the network, but it was still tedious. Well, back to my IM's... hehe.

      "I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name, PS I love you, forever and today."   I'm in a petty chipper mood today, which could be expected I suppose, as I got most of a full night's sleep. I think tonight I'll be going to bed at 9, because I'm still really behind on da sleep for some reason.   I was so annoyed at my mom yesterday. I had been telling her like all week that I was getting payed on Tuesday and needed her home so I could go to the bank and put money in and use the check card to order computer parts. So what's the one day she plans stuff and doesn't get home until 11:30? Why Tuesday of course. I was really impatient and stuff, but I got over that when I really thought about it, because realy I can afford to get the stuff anytime, as I'll be broke  after  getting it so I won't be able to get more parts anyway.   "Best friend worst thing, she's been cheating, friend decieves she leaves"   I'm such a slacker, I still haven't gotten Sarah her anniversary present. I know what it is now, I just haven't gone to the store to buy it. I really hope she likes it though... she will of course but I'm required to think like that (hehe).   "Alone with you... alone with me... what can I do I cannot breathe"   I think I fell asleep at work yesterday... like, fell asleep without being asleep. My mind just went away for an hour. It was ok though, I (thankfully) didn't get any new work to do in that time, so I wasn't like messing up on things or what not. I really like this laptop a lot more than my normal work computer... it hurts my eyes less and I can use it (again) on the Max.   Now since I have nothing else to say, a random song or two:   The Ataris - The Saddest Song  Only two more days, until your birthday  Yesterday was mine  You’ll be turning five  I know what it’s like, growing up without your father in your life   So I pretend,  I’m doing all I can  And I hope someday you’ll find it in your heart  To understand  Why I’m not around  And forgive me for not being in your life   I remember waiting  For you to come  Remember waiting  For you to call  Remember waiting there to find nothing at all  I remember waiting  For you to come  Remember waiting  For you to call  Waiting there to find nothing at all   Maybe someday  You really get to know me  Not just the letters read to you  I pray I get the chance  To make it up to you  We got a lot of catching up to do   So I pretend,&nbsp;  I’m doing all I can  And hope someday you’ll find it in your heart  To understand  Why I’m not around  And forgive me for not being in your life   I remember waiting  For you to come  Remember waiting  For you to call  Remember waiting there to find nothing at all  I remember waiting  For you to come  Remember waiting  For you to call  Waiting there to find nothing at all   Forgive me!  I’m so sorry!  I will make it up to you....    Avril Lavigne - Things I'll Never Say   I'm tuggin' at my hair  I'm pullin' at my clothes  I'm tryin to keep my cool  I know it shows   I'm staring at my feet  My cheeks are turning red  I'm searching for the words inside my head   I'm feeling nervous  Tryin' to be so perfect  Cause I know you're worth it  You're worth it--yeah   If I could say what I want to say  I'd say I want to blow you--away  Be with you every night  Am I squeezing you too tight  If I could say what I want to see  I want to see you go down--on one knee  Marry me today  Guess I'm wishing my life away  With these things I'll never say   It don't do me any good it's just a waste of time  What use is it to you what's on my mind  It ain't comin out we're not going anywhere  So why can't I just tell you that I care   Cause I'm feeling nervous  Tryin' to be so perfect  Cause I know your worth it   If I could say what I want to say  I'd say I want to blow you--away  Be with you every night  Am I squeezing you too tight  If I could say what I want to see  I want to see you go down--on one knee  Marry me today  Guess I'm wishing my life away  With these things I'll never say   What's wrong with my tongue  These words keep slipping away  I stutter I stumble like I've got nothing to say   Cause I'm feeling nervous  Trying to be so perfect  Cause I know you're worth it  You're worth it--yeah   I guess i'm wishing my life away  With these things I'll never say   If I could say what I want to say  I'd say I want to blow you--away  Be with you every night  Am I squeezing you too tight  If I could say what I want to see  I want to see you go down--on one knee  Marry me today  Guess I'm wishing my life away  With these things I'll never say  These things I'll never say

      I seriously love that my boss let me borrow the laptop.... there's nothing better than riding the max and typing a blog post at the same time, even if I can't post it until later... plus this keyboard is big and non-spongy, which would make anybody happy.   Today is payday (yay!), I'm ordering more computer parts (enough to finally start using the thing!) and also hopefully getting something for Sarah before she gets back from Hawaii.  I really haven't been up to too much... the sad thing about having a job is that when everyone else has no problem just doing things at random times, I kinda have to wait and hope they plan something for a weekend, which they do usually but not always.   Last Friday night (well, more Sunday morning) I went to Andrew's with Armaan until around 5:30am. That was pretty fun as I've never really hung out with Andrew much, nor been to his house. I think he thinks I'm an idiot but whatever, he wouldn't be entirely off in thinking that. Actually, I don't think he thinks that, I just think he's hard to red so I assume he's somehow hostile. After hanging out at Andrew's, we went to Danie's for the xfiles Marathon we had planned. We took a walk and did watch a couple of episodes, but most of the time was pretty hang-outish (which is always really fun... more fun than just watching DVD's if you ask me). I think it's kinda cool that Armaan's friends let me hang out with them so much, because I don't really have many friends of my own (I say Armaan's friend's but I guess somewhere they became mine too, as we do things without Armaan sometimes too). I was so tired by the time I got home, but I slept well later in the evening.   Sarah's still in Hawaii, she left on Sunday and is getting back on Wednesday next week. She's going to call me on Saturday if possible, so I'm trying not to plan anything for Saturday. It's hard not to, I may end up turning down a party that Mandy is planning, which would be sad, but I'd rather hear from Sarah.   Today, July 20, marks umm.... some odd days until School starts (I  believe  it starts on the 8th of September). Thank Goodness I get payed on such a regular basis, as I will really be pushing it with finishing that computer... oh, and I'll be even closer to the line of brokeness as I most likely need to buy a new desk to house it. Ah well, that's the way things work out.   Well, it's almost my Max stop, so I'm gonna finish this up. I don't really know what else to write about anyway..... we'll see if anything worth talking about happend at all this week. Armaan is planing a party for Thursday, and planning on seeing the Bourne movie... whatever the new one is. I won't be able to see the movie, but I hope I'm able to go to the party.

      Ooooo, blogger has wysiwyg editing now. That's pretty nifty, spiffy, and all around neato. &nbsp; I'm thinking about changing my template sometime, but I probably won't for a while. What do you think? If there's something blue I'd probably be happy with it. &nbsp; Man, I was sooooo tired this morning. I was up until like 1, after getting home ar like 12:20, after trying to clean up something that's talked about in  Armaan's Blog .... yeah it was interesting. &nbsp; Today at work I'm actually working on some stuff. We're changing some phone ports into fax ports and going to put fax software on people's computers/laptops if they want it. It means I get to play around with the switch board in the phone room... not my favorite activity (when you go to press the wires in they spark a little, it's creepy). But at least it beats sitting in front of the computer trying to make my character counter go up more.... so I guess that's good. &nbsp; It's almost lunch time, thank goodness... I'm hungry.

      Ok, so today has been very much without any activity... well ok, there was a small bit, and I have been installing Debian pretty much all day, but it's still been pretty slow. I think tomorrow I will bring a book, I need something to take up my time when I'm not working on anything. Today we got to RMA (IE: send in a return) a huge monitor, the box weighed like 50 pounds. Stupid ViewSonic is so cheap that they make us pay shipping even on the returns (wish they were like gateway). Ah well, I guess I can't expect everyone to be perfect. It amazes me how people in the "real world" act. This whole summer I've been surrounded by the real world, during the day at least. The people swear when things happen, they don't have a problem with it... and yeah... hmm, I guess that's really all they do. Oh yeah, they do one more thing. The term "get a life" doesn't apply to these people, as their job is their life. I guess in other words, it's their carreer. I guess you really do want to make sure you love whatever you decide to do as a career.  &nbsp;  Oh yeah, Armaan got his ear pierced. Crazy kid.

        Lonliness dominates you. You can hide it well, but its there, and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone, and need to do things to fill your time. Your afraid to tell people this, but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way, and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most. (Please Vote)    urlLink   What Emotion Dominates you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     That's a sad story :-\ I don't think I'm that sad....

      Wow... the whole last sentence ("oh man I've had like.... 5 pieces (hehe - there was a lot extra). I'm glad I was hungry!") of my last post sounds like Sarah.... that's creepy.  Yesterday after work I went to Forrest Grove and met Peter and Pat, then we went up to Brady's and I got to see my baby (my firstborn you could say... that sounds too weird to say though). After a while we went to Washington Square and met Armaan and goofed around at the Apple Store. It was fun and I'm sure the salespeople hated me especially (I love it, really I do).  After that we went to Subway but it was closed, so we went to McDonalds and ate random food (2 cheeseburgers! Wow!). On the way out I spotted my old friends from Frosh and Soph years, Brodi and Sam (they graduated my Soph year). They didn't see me but we ended up walking a ways behind them, and then there were tons of people from back then. So I got to see Brodi, Sam, Jenny, Maggie, and Amanda again... and I'm sure more people that I totally didn't notice... yeah that was really cool. They were all commenting on how much older i am, it was weird...  Pat was feeling sick so we went to Armaan's and hung out there watching videos from the other night, until parents came to get us (though Pat spent the night).  When I got home I walked into my room to find that my computer case had arrived a day early... so i stayed up a little too late fiddeling with it and a laptop I grabbed from Armaan.  That's really about it.  Goodness I hope I can get to Vancouver sometime this week...

      Today at work we had an "All Hands Meeting". Pretty much it was about the State of the Company.  I didn't know it but apperantly the Company is being bought in November or December, and changing it's name (though still being the same thing). It's too bad I'm only an intern, I think it'd be cool to be here for that.  After the meeting they had cake, and they had Carrot Cake! It's seriously the best stuff in the world... with it's wonderful creame cheese frosting... oh man I've had like.... 5 pieces (hehe - there was a lot extra). I'm glad I was hungry!

      I actually had a pretty good weekend. It was busy (thankfully) and passed pretty quickly.  Lets see... on Friday I worked until my usual 4:30ish time, and then I came home. Sarah called me around 7 from camp which was cool because I was missin her a bit (hehe). Nothing much else happened today, which was ok.  Saturday... today was a really busy day that never actually ended. My morning was pretty dull... just hanging around the house cleaning up my room (it's still a mess, but I can see the floor!). Later in the Evening I went to my Aunt's and ate chinese food with the folks... Mmmm, I love Fried Rice. We came home at just the right time, because not 10 minutes after I sat down I heard my name from outside, and Peter was there. So he came over and we talked for a bit and played with computer stuff, and then he had to go catch his bus home... which he missed... and it was the last bus out. So we decided he'd spend the night (with permission, of course). Well around 2 we started getting bored, and then I noticed good ole Carinsdev on AIM. So we IM'd Armaan and it ended up he picked us up and we hung out all over.  We went to this cool construction zone and explored and had interesting exploits with spray paint, cones,  and wireless network cards. Then breakfast at McDonalds.... Mmm good times. I got home around 7:30 and went to sleep while Peter did stuff. Then we went to Church and dropped Peter off at a bus stop so he could head home.  After Church my mom went to her friends house and I went with her and saw The Butterfly Effect. It's a very weird and twisted movie, but actually pretty good... though I wouldn't suggest seeing it if you're depressed. After the movie I went to Becky's house and hung out for a while. They're so funny... they made some (really real looking!) dummies and stuck them in their neighbors living room... amoung other things. Over there I watched The Secret Window... which is a really creepy movie. I actually kinda liked it though... because I've always kinda wished the "bad guy" didn't get caught for once, and it happened.  I rode the bus home because I didn't want to wait for my mom to be done at her friends, and I found out that Sarah's bus broke down in the middle of nowhere on the way home... though as I woke up this morning I discovered she'd gotten home and told me she was safe, so that's a relief.  Now here I am at work... listening to The All-American Rejects and not really having much to do. I can't wait until payday.... I need to figure out what to get someone for a 6 month aniversary....

      Ok I've decided what I'm going to do with this place (since at the moment I don't have a place to host another site). I'm gonna use this thing to do the normal, usual, "Today I...", and the uh... other one... to talk about uh... other things ( ;) at some).  Soooo, to start.  I've started construction on a new computer that's going to totally rock... well let me rephrase that, I ordered a few components. I will begin the construction as soon as I recieve them. I was planning on getting a laptop, but I decided a desktop was more economical for me and what I'm using. So here are the basic stats of the computer I'm building:  Motherboard -  Intel D875PBZ Motherboard   Processor -  Intel Pentium 4, 3.2ghz with 800mhz FSB and 1mb L2 cache, includes Hyperthreading   Ram -  1gb (2 512 sticks) Corsair 184pin Dual Channel DDR400   Hard Drive -  Maxtor 200GB 7200RPM IDE Hard Drive   Optical Drives -       .: Sony Black 52x32x52x16 Combo Drive (CD-RW/DVD-ROM)       .: ASUS Black 52X QuieTrack Technology CD-ROM Drive   Power Supply -  ASPIRE ATX-AS500W   Video -  .: nVIDIA GeForce FX 5700 256mb DDR ram  .: nVIDIA GeForce FX5200 128mb DDR ram, Dual-Head   Monitor(s) - ( 3 of them! )  SCEPTRE X7g-Komodo V 17" LCD Monitor   Sound - ( 1 ,  2 ) Creative Labs Sound Blaster Audigy2 ZS Platinum PCI Sound Card (THX Certified)  Speakers - ( 1 ,  2 ) Logitech THX Certified Z-680 5.1 500watt Speakers  That whole thing is costing me around $2,600. Not too shabby if I do say so myself.

      Hum, I'm thinking I'm overbudget on my computer somewhere and thus will not have enough for the three monitors I was going to get. We shall see how much I actually make eh? But if I don't have enough, I guess I'll just save my money for a while, after all, with everything else it's got I think I can be satisfied with only one monitor... or maybe two.  Tomorrow I'm going to be spending a hefty amount of money... well not spending all of it, but getting it out. First is $104 for Saturday and gifts. I'm bringing $40 for movies and food, and $5 to give Sarah to turn in for the beach trip in two weeks (which I mentioned to my mom and she didn't seem to have a problem with), $4 for an all day bus ticket for Sarah, and then another odd amount for the gifts I am getting her for our Anniversary last month. Armaan is going to be back by Saturday so it's possible he might go see the movie (The Village) with us or something, that'd be cool. Maybe I can get him to pick me and Sarah up, though it'd be quite a drive... hum.  On top of the money for Saturday, I'm also getting some pictures developed and buying a few more computer things (Drives, Sound Card, Video card, and a desk). After that I may well be almost done with the whole computer thing, just getting speakers and then taking a break to see if I'll have enough for monitors or not... yes it's fun.  The first week of school I am planning on getting the stupid proof of enrollment form so I can get my permit, and then I probably won't keep the permit for he full time you're "supposed" to have it, just until I'm a pretty good driver and stuff... I cannot wait. That's why I should save the extra ~$1000 that I would have left over if I don't worry about the monitors...

      Another slow day at work. I have done nothing today, but it's ok.  Armaan left I believe yesterday for his vacation to Six Flags, and I believe they're down in San Francisco at the moment. From the audiopost on his blog it sounds like an interesting trip so far... not really too fun though. Man I wish I could go on cool vacations... i havent in like... a long long time.  I'm really really really really hoping Sarah's parents will let her come over next Saturday. I'm doing lots of work at home so my mom will be ok with it, and I've got a lot of stuff planned (like... the whole day), in the end it just depends on if they'll let her come. I don't know that they're liking me too much anymore... I'm not sure... it'd be sad if they didn't :( Well, I don't think her Dad has a problem with me, but her Mom is (I think) starting to want me not to be around her very much. Oh well, we'll get older and that won't be a problem, and I can hope that it isn't true.  I was talking to this guy today about retirement trusts... they actually sound like  really really good idea. You can stick $1350 in a trust and wait 5 years, then retire and you get $87,000, and then a check for $9,300 a Month for the rest of your life. Is that crazy or what? I might put the money into it next year assuming I get another job, that would be so cool to retire right out of college (LOL), and only have to work because I want to rather than because it's a requirement.... like... I could be a developer or something! Neato dorrito.  Humm, what else... School starts on the 7th or 8th of September, after that no more work for me. It's bittersweet in many ways, I will like the break that school will be (it takes less time out of the day), but I will have homework. On top of that I will not have income again, and I probably won't get to see Sarah as often. I want to get into at least seeing her every two weeks... I really need my license.   When I was a boy I was told that anybody could become President; I'm beginning to believe it. - Clarence Darrow

      Today (now actually yesterday, though my body-clock still thinks it's today) was fun overall.  The turkey bowl turned out to be held at Century High School instead at of one of the church's fields (no mud - a good thing).  I have come to a realization; I suck at football. :)  It still was pretty fun though, there were only three or four people that actually played well, so again, it was fun.  Those four hours were filled with little oddities, ranging from Patrick drinking beer out of a crushed can, to the Century crowd upending the field goal posts, to Cori ripping my backpack, to Nicole later running over it with her car.  I have some quirky friends. :)  Well in reality I'm probably more screwed up then they are. ;)   Anyway, after that Goody and I decided that we wanted to go to Fry's to take advantage of a really good one-day sale.  We attempted coursing numerous people to transport us there, and finally after much misunderstanding, my mom took us.  When we got there, we met an hour-long line which my mom (cool as she is) stayed in for us while we hunted for the stuff we wanted.  As it turned out, the entire trip was a futile effort since almost all the items we wished to procure had sold out long before we got there.  Oh well, it meant that I got to spend more time with Goody, and I am thankful for at least that.    Well, I'm running on steam, and even that's about to give out so I'd better end it there for tonight (this morning - lol).  Listening to:  Deadbeat Holiday - Greenday

      Ok, I guess I'll finally succumb to the ever-increasing crowd of bloggers and start my own.  This is Thanksgiving morning, and I'm slightly looking forward to it... We've finally broken the trend of having 40+ people over, and are just going to have 10 to 20.  If all goes, as is our custom, we'll be up till way past 2:00am.  Oh brother, I just remembered I'm going to a turkey bowl (mud football for those uninformed few) tomorrow morning.  *groan*  That wouldn’t be much of a problem, if it weren't for the sleep (or lack there of) that I have been getting over the last week.  From Friday to Monday, I got around 14 hours of sleep TOTAL. Well, whatever... I'll take each day as it comes.  Just a random note:  I love Grand Prize - been listening to them non-stop for 20-some-odd hours (fell asleep to them) and... and ... oh, nevermind.  (This was actually written at 10:36am, November 28th, but due to errors on my part, I have had to repost it now.)

      The 21st???  Dang, I haven't posted for a long time!  *reaches into the deep recesses of his brain in effort to pull out memories of everything that has happened in the last week and 'a half*    On Monday the 23rd, I went to the Christmas party our youth group put on with Gwen.  It was pretty fun and sporadic - kinda like youth group normally is - hmm... I wonder why... :)  On Tuesday, the 24th, I went to see LotRs again with quite a few more people, but I woke up around 12:10, and the movie started at 1:00, so I had barely enough time to make it the theater.  I was going to invite Gwen to it, but I didn't even know the time we were supposed to be there, until right after I woke up - dumb of me.  Then, on Christmas the (come on now, everyone knows that date), we had around 45 ppl over, including the Lundins, and the [L]Andersons.  We pretty much screwed around the entire night, and got nothing productive done.  Later, on Thursday the 26th (is this even necessary anymore?), I had lunch at Gwen's house, and met her family - specifically her dad, who I talked to at some length concerning taking her to the banquet.  He's a cool guy.  Well, actually, in a broader view, they're a cool family. *If only my family weren't so dysfunctional, then maybe we'd be 'cool' in some sense as well*  hmm... wishful thinking.  One unfortunate highlight was when she asked me a rather simple, direct question - in what manner was I inviting her to the banquet? As a friend, or more?  For some reason that I still can’t figure out, I balked, and offered no straight answer, and she dropped it. (Though after much thought concerning the emotional well being of both of us at such an early stage, I called her back the next day and confirmed that we were still on officially 'just friends', but subject to change.)  Early Saturday morning (like 5:15, which was bad, cause I got to sleep at around 3:00), I got up, and my dad drove me out to a starbucks near my cousins' old house, where I met my uncle, and drove all the way over to Mt. Bachelor to go skiing.  I can't believe how stinkin' bad I was at first.  I was REALLY out of practice.  My uncle is a very advanced skier, but for some reason he decided to snowboard. It looked rather funny watching him, because he turned out to be a worse snowboarder than I was a skier.  After several hours, we drove back to Redmond and met the rest of my family at my other uncle's vacation "cabin" (or at least, that's what he made it out to be...).  It turned out to be a gated 2,700 square foot house with a three-car garage, and a 100-acre luxury golf course bordering the back lawn.  The subdivision even had it's own private indoor / outdoor pool, and fitness center.  My cousins and sisters and I got little sleep because of my newly acquired Xbox, and matching HALO. :)  We went to a church the next morning, and I was so unbelievably tired, that I almost slept though the sermon.  We went back to the super-cabin and I took a five-hour nap, completely missing my family's trip to the best Chinese restraunt under Oregon sun.  Once I woke up, we played more HALO, and finally got bored, and went to the pool complex around 9:00.  After and hour of swimming inside, we got bored yet again, and decided to go make use of the hot tubs out in the snow.  We did that for about half an hour, and got tired of it, so we went and rolled around in the snow for a little while, and got back in again.  After quite a while later, we decided that the ice forming in our hair wasn't such a good thing after all, and retreated back to our mega-cabin.  Then, this morning, we got up, and went to the mountain yet again, and messed around in the snow for another hours or so, and then drove all the way back home, with a short stop at an Izzy's in Bend.  Tomorrow, my youth group is having a big New Year's party from 6:30, to 1:30 (or something like that...), and I want to invite Gwen to it.  Though there is a possibility that she's going to her church's New Year's overnighter... Something I was going to go to, but for lack of funds.  It's late, and I'm tired - need sleep, must go...  P.S. I am an anti-Andrewist  (don't ask)

      I finally got my Learner's Permit on Tuesday, after month of being to lazy to get my parents to go with me to DMV.     Wednesday (my 16th birthday) was rather uneventful.  The majority of my family local to this area went to Old Country Buffet in Beaverton to celebrate.  Fun, I guess...  I got a Van de Graff generator which, upon assembly, fail to operate.  That was a rather large disappointment, since I had spent almost 5 hours on it.    Yesterday, We had our "Christmas party" of sorts at school, and I finally invited Gwen to the Winter Banquet (after several schedule conflict which I had to resolve before I even knew if I was going to go), but now my parents are getting more restrictive, and saying that I should ask her to pay for her own ticket, because if I pay for it, it'll be a "date"...  I never really got that reasoning, but I guess I'll just have to flow with it...    Later that afternoon, Goody's family (minus two siblings), Peter, Rachael, Emily, and I went to see  The Two Towers .  It was way better than I thought it was going to be, but I was expecting more people to be coming.  Later when I got home, I received a message from Brady informing me that I had not, in fact invited them to it, though I had been operating the last couple day, with the expectation of seeing them there...  Really stupid of me.   Consequentially, I am prolly going to go see it again with them within the next week.

      I actually ended up going to see Nemesis right after school on Thursday with Gwen, Brady, Cori, Cameran, and Matt.  It was a cool movie, as far as Star Trek movies go...  I slept in on Saturday (I really needed it - had had almost no sleep the past week), and helped cater at a Christmas play done by Southwest Hills that night.  I think I ate one meal the entire day. :)  I got to Calvary slightly early on Sunday, cause the tech guys were testing a new digital board, and I was riding with some of the musicians.  During second service, Brady, Steven, Cameran, Emily, and I walked a couple blocks over to Carl's Jr. ... in the pouring rain ... in my suit.  :)  We spent prolly 45 minutes over there, and walked back.  I then donned a regular jacket in place of my suit, and we walked a couple more blocks over to the theater to buy tickets for another showing of Nemesis.  After we all saw the movie (all 25 of us), I went over to Goody's house and stayed for about half an hour before getting picked up, and driven back home.  Today, by contrast, was rather uneventful.  Oh, and I finally got Gwen's aim screen name, after weeks of forgetting to ask her for it.  :)  *Happy*  Feeling: Hunger, Tiredness, Anxiety about the upcoming Learner's Permit test tomorrow.

      Again, I haven't posted for a while.  This last week or so has been really busy (as usual).  My parents were out of town on Monday, and I stayed over night at Brent's house.  Going to and from school on Tues. was annoying cause a had a couple huge bags with me, besides my school stuff.  SWHB youth group on Tuesday was pretty fun - nothing that much out-of-the-ordinary happened, it was just fun.  Last night's CCWC youth group was better, though.  Afterward, Brady, Cori, Steven, and I walked over to Carl's Jr., in the rain, and got milkshakes of all things.  :)  I'm looking forward to the growth group I have tomorrow night (at the bowling alley), seeing  Nemesis  on Sunday, my birthday on Wednesday, and possibly going to see the Nutcracker Ballet on Thursday.

      Hmm... I haven't posted in a while.  I'm still sick, and on Thursday I skipped school, partly because I wasn't feeling good, and partly because I was tired.  ( I think they're interchangeable)  Anyway, because of it, I'm slightly backed up in school work.  Yesterday I went to two basketball games between my school and my best friend's and we lost to them (both the girl's game, and the guy's).  It was kinda funny.  I stayed over night at his house afterward, and we just sat around lazy, doing nothing. It was fun. :)  Missed helping out at church (laying sod and stuff) cause we slept in, but whatever.  I would have been really tired anyway, after it.    Oh, Brady suddenly got his sight back on Wednesday night! I'm really happy for him.

      Not much to say about today, except Rachael told me that she found out from one of the Lundin's that I used to be obsessed with her during our choir years.  Hahahaha  I think that's kind of funny, cause I haven't the slightest recollection of it.  ...Whatever...  Oh, also my dad blew up at my tonight, for reasons as of yet unknown, and wouldn't let me go to youth group.  He's been doing ALOT of stuff like that lately.  I might go into more detail in a later post, but I see no real reason right now.  Brady (my friend that went blind last Sunday) is doing really well, all things considered.  He is a strong Christian, and I am really thankful that he has not become too discouraged or depressed (at least as far as I can tell).  Well, God’s plans are many times not our own, and we just have to trust Him to work out everything for the best in all of this.  Feeling: Tired, Annoyed, and Mad at my runny nose  ;)

      Arrg! I hate colds!  I just got one last week, and it wasn’t bad until Sat. morning when it reared its ugly head.   (Of course, given the fact that I knew that I had a cold, it wasn’t the brightest idea to eat all those cookies last night) but in any event, my cold did get worse.  I am rather annoyed that it kept me from church this morning, even if it was just Southwest Hills Baptist, not Calvary Chapel.  Whatever - church is church no matter the location I guess.  I am really hoping that tomorrow is off school, cause I still don't have the final draft of my report done... I'm thinking that I probably should go attend to that...  [This was written almost an hour after the above]  Man, this is insane, I just found out that my friend Brady collapsed in the middle of service today at my church, with a migraine and went blind.  I'm talking to him on im right now... he's using voice recognition.  This is too weird...

      Well, last Friday and Saturday were the pinnacle of fun for this year for me.  Around 3:00pm on Friday, my dad picked me up from school, and took me to church to grab one of our projectors.  I then drove home and arrived about five minutes before Brady did.  Andrew and Steven showed up about half an hour later, and we set up three Xboxs (for HALO), the projector, and several TVs.  Around 5:00pm, most of the other people (Matt, the other Matt, another Andrew, David, Ben, Sasha, Jeremy, Adam, Cameran, Peter, and Pat) arrived. We set up the other two Xboxs, two Gamecubes, and an original NES (Ben's).  Networking the Xboxs turned out to be rather troublesome, and in the end, David and I had to go get another cable from CompUSA.  We got back, ate, and played a ton of LAN games (HALO) until Goody and Kevin finally arrived (around 11:30pm).  We then had some dessert, and opened random presents.  Pat got me a really tight airsoft gun. :)    Anyway, around 12:30, we moved two Xboxs and the projector down into the first story (mostly guest and storage rooms, the second is the main living area, and the third is where all out bedrooms are), and just basically stayed hunkered down there for about a couple hours while Ben serenaded us with the keyboard and techno stuff.  By about 3:00am, we were all feeling slightly hyper / tired - a weird state to be in.  All of us that were in the main storage area, were acting really weird, doing really stupid (or in Ben's case, amazingly good) techno dances and just generally messing around.  I suddenly go the bright idea to get out or camcorder, and videotape everything.  Before long, I got bored of it, and Ben and Kevin started messing around with it.  Eventually, all three of us suddenly ran out of the house, and up to the road, and proceeded to act out an impromptu skit about "nose cancer" (don't ask me, it was Kevin's idea).  This basically entailed us running around the 5 or 6 blocks local to my house, with trench coats, spotlights, and airsoft guns, alternately inspecting random vehicles, and pretending to be dead in the middle of the street.  (In retrospect, I'm quite glad some of my paranoid neighbors didn't see us.)    Once we went back inside, things mellowed down a bit, until about half an hour later, when I got the great idea of going on a walk.  Peter and Kevin joined me, and we walked a little over a mile to the Plaid Pantry to get some Henry Wineheart's root beer.  Then, we got the bright idea to go "nutria hunting" on the way back up to the house.  Now picture this - three 16 year old guys walking though a small park, closely encircled with several subdivisions, wearing trench coats, carrying huge spotlights, airsoft guns (which look like real handguns, except under close inspection), and root beer bottles (which look like real beer bottles, except under close inspection), at 6:00 IN THE MORNING, looking for nutria in the water.....  It's a wonder we didn't get caught.  And, once we got all the way back up to my house again, we decided, not to stop, but top go even further, almost the same distance above the house, as we had gone below.  When we finally get back, 2 hours had passed, and we had walked almost 4 miles.  I was one of only three people that slept that night, and I only slept from 9am to 11am.    By 1pm, everyone that was not spending the night the next night had left (everyone except Goody and Andrew).  We were so spaced out by that time, that we spent the rest of the afternoon mostly comatose, watching mindless movies, and playing more HALO.  Goody got to sleep around 11:00pm, and Andrew and I fell asleep, watching a Metallica / San Francisco Symphony Concert.    Zao, Metallica, and Queen are now on my "most downloaded songs list"

      Man, yesterday was  REALLY  cool!  First, we got out of school around 12:00, and my dad pick me up and took me to get a haircut.  We then went shopping for a tie (and decided I would just use one of my dad's instead. - lack of selection).   I went home, took a shower, sat around for an hour or so, had a light snack, and changed into my suit.  My dad then drove me to Gwen's house, where we had a cool conversation with her dad, and occasionally with her mom as she walked through, all the while, vaguely aware of the commotion in other parts of the house as Gwen finished getting ready.  As she came out, my first thought was *man, she looks beautiful*. :) :)  Anyway, we took some pictures there, and had some trouble getting my boutonnière on. :)  And then, *zoom*, down, the highway we went, to the general area of Shenanigan's, and promptly got lost for ten minutes. (as if we weren't already late)   Once we finally got there, we had to walk for a couple minutes to get to the banquet hall.  (Gwen was wearing a rather thin dress, so she was freezing the entire way.)  The masquerade theme was kinda funny, but cool at the same time.  Anyway, we sat down at a table occupied by Missy, Kathleen, and Jalon.  I ordered chicken, and Gwen ordered steak (which turned out to be very rare when she got it - so rare in fact, that she had to send it back to be re-cooked, and half-an-hour later when it arrived again, it was STILL slightly rare).  I would be surprised if at least some of the people that got the steak don't get food poisoning.  Oh well.  The salad was pretty good though.  Later, several more people arrived at our table and royally confused the waiters with all our combined orders. (lol)  After we were done eating we juss walked around for a while, talking to people, and eventually decided to get our pictures taken.  That was an interesting experience - We misunderstood the photographer's question "are you a couple?" to mean 'is there anyone else going to be in this pic', not 'are you dating'.  So, I answered yes, which led to a rather embarrassing situation.  (I'm not going to post what happened, but will tell anyone that asks directly).  Anyway, the rest of the time there was kinda awkward, but still went pretty well.  Then my dad picked us up, and we headed back to my house.  When we got back, we waited around for a couple minutes until Adrian and Melissa came, and then spent a couple hours watching signs.  By the end of the evening, we were all pretty tired, and hyper - an interesting state to be in.  Anyway, they left around 12:25, and I went to bed, and slept for 12 hours. :)

      Yesterday was kinda annoying in an odd way - I woke up an half an hour early, and still made it to school late.  My dad was driving (go figure).  Not much happened at school, but afterward, my mom and I drove all over the retarted city trying to find this one airsoft handgun that everyone carried, but no one had in stock.  It was bugging me that we weren't finding it, but I had kinda suspected that I would have to order it online anyway.  Then that night, right before youthgroup, my parents and I had a big blowup - resulting in my not being able to attend yg.  [may elaborate later ... currently too tired]  This morning, I left school for 2 hours after 2nd period for an orthadontist appointment.  The actual time in the othadontist's office was realitively short, but I didn't really feel like going directly back to school, and my mom didn't care, so we spent a while in an army surplus store checking out different swords and handguns n'stuff.  I was opporating really weirdly when I got back, losing my notebook, and overcoat twice in two hours...  I guess I need more sleep or something...  Oh well, I'm off to do juss that.   O, I am really enjoying cable modem. :)  I downloaded more than 150 songs and music vids in the past week.  I've developed an interesting liking to Good Charlotte, Taking Back Sunday, and AFI.  Currently watching: Days of the Phoenix - AFI

      The 8th was cool.  We ended up, not only taking Gwen and her mom, but Josh, Andy, and one of Andy's sisters too.  For the first production on a new stage, the play was pretty impressive, and the usual beginning technical glitches were just par for the course.  There was one rather humorous time when the lights went up, and the main character was standing on one of the stages.  He looked around, puzzled for a second or two, then quietly walked off the stage.  After the lights took two minutes to dim back off, the audience for some reason started clapping. (lol)  He reappeared a few minutes later with the missing prop - a phone.  One of the scenes was some character's creepy nightmare.  It reminded me kinda of the production  Eternity .  On Saturday, I borrowed a couple guns from Josh for the airsoft war, and got a ride with Liv and Jeremy, who were also taking Steven.  The drive took about one-and-a-half hours.  We got there, played several hours until lunch, then went inside for about half an hour, then went back out again for another solid four hours of shooting each other down.  My dad arrived just as twilight faded, and it became impractical to continue.  Olivia stayed the night at the location we had the war at, and Jeremy, Steven, and I slept on the way back.  :)  We were really tired.  This morning, I woke up an hour late, and almost missed my ride to church.  Gwen and her dad came to first service - that was cool, though she had to leave immediately afterward.  I got the weirdest head ach, and almost fell asleep.  After second service, Steven and I walked over to the Fred Meyer complex to look for Brady, who had taken a different street, and come back at the same time we left.  I was going to go over to his house, but I couldn't contact my parents.  I went home with the Gadaholts and Ben (as usual).  We fired off more potato cannon test booms and later went down to a lake to poach Nutria. (jk) We were thinking about taking the spud cannon and scaring ducks with it though...

      Youthgroup was weird today.  We just moved it over to Tuesday night this week, and the entire Stages (the company that's doing  The Cross and the Switchblade ) crew and cast were in the building doing a final dress rehersal before tomorrow night.  Needless to say, things were hecktic at best.  Gwen didn't seem to mind though (I invited her to the opening play yesterday, and Youthgroup this morning).  Her mom's prolly coming to the play too.  I pushed my annual insanely large slumber party back to the 24th and 25th because a large portion of the people I would be inviting to it were doing stuff this week (including the airsoft war this Saturday, which I'm prolly going to ride with Oliva and Jeremy to).  O, i FINALLY got broadband!!!  (more specifically cable modem)  *is happy*

      Church was cool today, inspite of my sleep (or lack there of) which consited of two hours of tossing and turning the night before.  I just realized that I saw Goody for the first time in like, two weeks today.  After church, I messed around on the stage which is being suddenly transformed into several streets in New York (a backdrop for an upcoming play -  The Cross and the Switchblade , opening next Wednesday).  I spent the afternoon with the Gadaholts and [a really cool guy who's in the Coast Guard, and I can't remember his name for the life of me, but I'll edit this post later with it when I remember it].  We went to Taco Bell, where I made myself mad by continuousely spilling parts of my taco on my trench coat, and then progressed back to their house, with Mrs. Vanhorn (the wife of one of our pastors) and her grandchildren.  We had some fun making very loud booms with Uncle Greg [Gadaholt]'s spud cannon, but eventually put it away in fear of the wrath of the neighbors. :)  I then came back home and started working on backed up homework that I had from before Christmas break, and that's what I'm still doing right now.

      Today was rather uneventful.  I got up, took shower, got dressed, ate breakfast, and sped off to school in the Gadeholt mobile.  Then, I slept through first period, studied through second, grabbed a bite to eat at break, sped through third period, floundered through fourth.  I rethought the meaning of life, and God's purpose for humanity as a whole, while staring at Gwen during lunch.  I breezed through sixth period (lunch counts as fifth), died during seventh, and slept through eighth.  I then spaced out on the bus, daydreamed in one of Farzad's 57 (yes, I am so freaking serious - 57!) cars (a Black VW Beatle) on the way home, and dozed through my piano lesson.    Once I was home for good, I studied the Bible for about 45 minutes, and laid down on my bed for ½ an hour, contemplating cleaning my room.  Finding little to no pleasure in that, I started to do random work on my computer, and that's about where I am now.  Tomorrow I plan to walk down to Andy’s house, and spend the day with him and Gwen (well, the day, up until 3:30).  Then, I will possibly drop by Bwitty’s house, and say hi to her and Jamie.  After which, at about 7:00 everyone from my growth group is coming over for a Bible study.

      Man, I haven't posted for a LONG time... I've been way to busy thinking of excuses for not doing it...  Now that I suddenly realized that my friend Steven has a blog ( urlLink see his blog ) up, it sorta' motivated me to make some changes to mine.  I'll work on a timeline of all the last several weeks, but it won't be up until at least Friday night.  I'm getting ready to go to my church's mid-week service, tonight at 7:00, and am looking forward to it.  Goody's wearing his new combat boots (lol).    Youth Group last night was fun.  I really like the series we're going though right now, concerning evangelism.  It’s an area that I’m really week in, and I am finding myself wishing we were going to spend more time on it.  I think Stages may finally not be using the building on Tuesday nights from now on, which means we (the youth group) will have the sanctuary to ourselves.  We had a really cool worship chapel today at school.  It's amazing the talent some of my classmates have.  Oh, speaking of school, I woke up at 7:20 today, and had to get to school 1hr and 25 mins late ;)  Well, g2g get ready for tonight. Adios All!~

      I… HATE… FEVERS!!!!!  I had a bit of a cough on Tuesday, and other than my chronic congestion, I didn’t think much of it… Then, I woke up at 7:30 am on Wednesday with a splitting headache and a temperature.  I went right back to sleep, and didn’t wake up until after 5:45 pm.  I was so dizzy, it’s not even funny – plus I was feeling sick to my stomach.  Amazingly, I stayed awake until almost 12:00 am.  But, when I woke up today I felt miserable again.  I thought I was doing better around this afternoon, and even told Gwen, when she dropped my homework assignments off, that I would be back in school tomorrow, now though, I know that’s not the case.  I hope this doesn’t linger into spring break – what with the two-day airsoft war planned and all… though, I may not have been able to go anyway because of my chronic congestion.  On Saturday, I spent six hours at the studio working on a show.  It was kind of weird working with the lighting and everything – we had to mask the identity of the person talking throughout the entire show, and it took almost two hours to set up the lighting in the correct fashion.  I went over to the Hakim’s house afterward, but couldn’t stay more than a couple hours because we had guests over at our house.  On Sunday, the 16th, I got a ride to and from Calvary with the Gadaholts, and had lunch with them. Before that, though, we met up with Ryan and Neil Castro (who also came over for lunch) and gave Ben a ride to his house. I spent a couple hours there, watching Christine, Timy and Neil playing some rather hilarious games of foosball, and marveling at the pace at which Ryan reads (though Kathleen can read faster). My parents came and picked me up around 3:00, leaving just enough time for me to get ready to go to Young Hee’s surprise party, host by Melissa, at 4:30. Not that many people were there compared to a week before (it was me *duh*, Melissa umm… *duh* again, Young Hee *I don’t like *duh*s anymore, Grace, Adrie, Daniel, Butters, and Gwen (who was working and arrived at 6:45).  I brought my two cameras (one video, one still) at Gwen’s request – since she would be arriving an hour and 45 minutes after Young Hee, after all. The party was fun until around 5:30, half an hour after Young Hee arrived, when something disturbing happened.  I rather suddenly sank into a huge state of depression - something that had only happened a few times before in my life.  I cheered up a bit again when Gwen arrived, but as soon as we started watching a movie (Rush Hour 2), I started feeling like the whole world was out to get me again.  I don’t think I ever want to see that movie again – I downloaded it off the web, and watched the first half hour of it again – with bad results. I didn’t start to feel better until about half an hour after the movie finished, and we were playing some random game (Mafia, I think). It’s really, really strange looking back on it.  I don’t recall much of what happened on Monday…  On Tuesday, I went to youth group, only to discover that it will be another two weeks before we (the youth group) can use the sanctuary again – stages just started setting up the set for their next play – Song on the Mountain.  After youth group, I decided to join of group of people (ten, including me), who want to learn more about evangelism, and still act as a sort of “support team” for each other.   Later that evening, I was talking to someone on im, and found out that I had really offended them at school that day, and I hadn't even realized it... that sort of didn’t let me sleep very easily that night.  Then the next day, and today, I was / am sick.  *joy*   u…huh   o, never mind.

      tired..... tired..... tired.....   ... Anyway, I've been running all over the place this last week or so.  Saturday, I painted the inside halls of my school, spent a couple hours at Tualatin Valley Television while some friends of mine were editing footage from a tight retreat that I had to miss cause I had way to much home work.  Then, I went to Melissa's house for her b-day party.  For the first hour or so, until Butters decided to show up, I was the only guy among, like 20 girls at the party. It was cool; we watched a couple movies and played random games for several hours.    Sunday, I went to my parent's church. It was ok.  Monday, I didn't do much out of the ordinary.  Tuesday, I went to youth group. *duh*  Man, Stages wastes no time - they had their last performance of the Cross and the Switchblade on Sat., and by Tuesday, all but a couple tiny parts of the massive set was torn down.  We had worship in the Fellowship Hall cause the on-stage end of the PA system wasn't up yet.  This was the second to the last week that we're going through the evangelism course.  Next week we'll wrap it all up, and the week after, we'll go back to normal yg teaching. After we got out, I spent more than 45 minutes trying to pipe the music from the cd changer through our new digital mixer, into the mains. I finally figured out what setting was wrong and corrected it, right as my dad walked in. lol  Wednesday, Ben came over, just for the sake of coming over (he just started a new trimester, and didn’t need help with math).  My mom took us over to midweek, and Uncle Greg gave me a ride back home.  I love midweek – it has an amazing atmosphere to it.  Josh lent his red leather jacket from the play. I wanted to wear it to school on Friday for school spirit day, but it was raining and I opted for a jacket with a hood instead. (Actually, this week was spirit week – Monday was twin day, Tues. was super hero day, Wed. was nerd day, Thurs. was blast from the past day and today was school spirit day.)  After the service, Trevor and I went out back and checked out this tight tiny VW bus.  The thing is like, 8 feet long, 4 feet wide and 4 feet high. The engine block is in the back, so Trevor and I could easily lift the front half up off the ground.  The entire weight of the thing, including engine block, can’t be more than 800 pounds. :)  Thursday, I wanted to help out with a show Pastor Steve was doing at the studio, but I had too much homework. I was talking to Jamie on im, and was planning on dropping in on her and Brittany quickly, but my mom wouldn’t let me until after we ate dinner (which turned out to take an hour to make, not 10 minutes).  Then, I called them and said I’d try to drop by today, but that didn’t work since I was only home long enough to take a shower and head off to my small group tonight.    Today was pi day (3-14), and we had a party in pre Calc.  *yay*  We also had a "pep rally" (if you can call it that...) after last period.  Since our high school student body is only 130-some-odd people, it wasn’t that big of a deal.  It mostly consisted of our three basketball teams (girl’s, guy’s JV, and guy’s V) facing each other off in an amazing set of playoffs (well… two), using a beach ball-sized ball, with circus music playing in the background.  After school, I got a haircut, ran into Mr. Rivas at Costco, talked to him for around half an hour while waiting for the employees to get me some more contacts, then ran over to Best Buy to get some badly needed RAM.  While there, I spotted a tight AFI cd (Sing the Sorrow) for $6.99, and bought it.  I got home, took a shower, jumped in the car, and promptly tool 45 minutes to get to a destination (my small group) less then 20 miles away…  First, my dad misread the directions (I was driving), and we overshot the turn by 2.6 miles… Then, he again misread the directions, and we overshot the next turn by 4 miles… Then, he misread the directions again, and in the process of turning around, he directed me into a ditch.  All in all, it was quite funny.    Tomorrow, I'm going to help out with a program that Andrew’s dad is recording, from 2 to 6 pm.  Then, on Sunday, I'm attending a surprise party for one of my upper classmen, at Melissa’s house again, from 4:30 to 9 pm.  I’m prolly going to catch a ride back with Gwen and Adrie, since my parents are going to be at a bible study.

      Well, I'm happy that I made it to youth group tonight. :)  This past week or so, I have been turning the prospect of graduating a year early over in mind, but only today did I really get on the ball and do something about it.  It's a strong possibility, but I would need to accumulate all of my Junior credits during this summer, which means I prolly won't have time to do the ASE apprenticeship thingy... but, I guess you can't win 'em all...  Anyway, the school has a policy preventing people from graduating a year early, so I had to meet with the school board tonight to deliver a thesis on why I want to graduate next year, not the year after.  It took alot less time than I expected (6:45 - 7:30), so I was still able to get to youth group right after worship.    Ben's coming over tomorrow afternoon again, to work on math, and Christine may accompany us as well. Speaking of tomorrow, I really love the new mid-week service.  The atmosphere is amazing.  I especially like the "After Glow" (a period of time after the service - about an hour - where they gradually dim the lights and leave the worship team going as background music and just leave it open for people to pour their hearts out to the Lord.  It's an amazing time.  Yesterday Missy Berdan got back from a month in Africa as a missionary.  Well, it was technically yesterday, but for all practical purposes, it was the day before (1:00am, or somewhere around there...).  She took me home from school that day, and we were talking about her trip, in the car.  She had a really cool time there, and has some interesting stories about it. :)  Well, I am stinking tired, and need sleep.  Will post more about the last couple days, tomorrow. Night all~

      Listening to: El Shaddai - To Him Sits on the Throne Feeling: worshipful, praise filled, slightly tired  I woke up once at 3:00 am, once again at 5:00, and then again at 7:00 and 8:00.  Consequentially, I was really annoyed when I failed to wake up at my alarm’s designated sounding point (9:30), but rather woke up at 11:45.  I got up, jumped in the shower, grabbed a piece of toast, and walked, in the rain, down to Andy’s house.  I got there, spent an hour talking to his dad and him about all their high priced computer paraphernalia, and started playing computer games with him (on 2 of his 9 computers upstairs).  We switched over to XBOX when Gwen arrived, and continued on it until half an hour before they left for work at 3:45 (they both work at the same grocery store).   I then walked up to Bwitty’s house, and talked to her step-dad for a little while before heading further up to our house (Bwitty and/or Jamie were not home).  I made myself some lunch, sat around, and cleaned up the house for around an hour, before heading back down again to see if they were home yet (the time frame her dad had advised). Alas, they weren’t, so I gave up for the day and headed back.    People from my bible study started to trickle in around 6:45, and everyone had arrived by 7:15.  We spent around 1½ hours playing XBOX, eating pizza, and talking, and spent around an hour on studying the Bible. (lol)  I think we need to rethink our priorities when attending this study.  Anyway, everyone was gone by 10:20, and my mom and dad drove me back down to Andy’s house (he and Gwen had just gotten home from work at 10:00, but sadly, she had to stay home).  He, his dad and I talked more about computers, then played XBOX together.  It was fun.  My parents picked me up at 12:25, and here I am, at my computer, right now   Listening to: El Shaddai - Holy Spirit Medley Feeling: joyful, exuberant, eyes heavy (dumb contacts)

      During youth group this evening, a thunderstorm that had been rolling in for several hours set forth at full force upon us. Corbin, Steven and I ran outside, and walked around for almost ten minutes as the huge raindrops filled the skies and soaked our shirts. (lol) The heat (65 degrees – warm by our standards) and humidity kept us warm, and I felt like I was in the most tranquil spot on earth. Standing there, at the edge of the field around the church, with water pouring down my face, I felt so peaceful; it seemed to me like the rest of the world just melted away for the little bits of time between the awesome flashes of electricity and raw power behind the deafening noise set forth. Then, as we ran around the side of the church, we saw, amidst all this, a double rainbow; a full arc from one end of the sky to the other, shining bright. My, what a stark contrast to the deep black hue that was the thundercloud. I was reminded through this, really just how awesome God's creation is, and through it, how He allows us to get a tiny glimpse at His majesty.

      Man, today was a pretty bad day all around, I guess.  I got up, and got to school on time (which is rare), and lasted through first period, chapel (in which Laura, Gwen and I led the pledges), and most of second, but during first break I was terrible. I have no idea why, but I suddenly felt all this weight upon my shoulders, and lost the will to do really anything. I just wandered around in a semi-daze for a while until third period (English, a class I really enjoy). Then I was fine again, and even happy and stuff, but then fourth (Computer 2); I hate that class with a passion. Don't get me wrong, I love doing anything computer related, but this class bugs the heck out of me for some reason. It's like I can never please the teacher or my peers. They come into it with some weird preconceived notion that I am inferior in all aspects of life, and don't waste any energy trying to contain their opinions. Plus the teaching methods are... intolerable. The teacher doesn't give ANY handouts or guides to ANYTHING (well, I must correct myself, he did give us a total of six, maybe seven sheets of paper this year - mostly pictures of what our projects are supposed to look like.), but makes us rely solely on notes. This would not be so bad if the guy could keep thinking on the same track for more than 26 seconds at a time. He continuously jumps around between topics, then doubles back and corrects himself, then stops to think for a minute, then can’t remember what he was trying to say, and so, jumps to another random, entirely unrelated topic. (Does it seem like I’m aggravated?)  ‘Ne way, I had lost all resolve to so anything that period, and had just resigned myself to staring blankly at the monitor for the entire 45 minutes.    Lunch wasn’t much better. Gwen was in a junior planning meeting for the upcoming retreat, so I couldn’t talk to her. (Something I desperately wanted to do – I always, with maybe one exception, cheer up when I’m conversing with her.)   Fifth period (typing) was almost as bad as fourth. The only thing I got accomplished in the entire class was a short sorrowful poem that I have yet to complete, name, and post. Sixth (pre-Calc – the hardest math course offered at our school for one’s relative knowledge level at entrance) was also really bad. I got a hard test back, and found out I got a 6 out of 14 correct. That pretty much shot the rest of that period. I just laid my head in my arms and tried to shut the world out for a little while, with little success.   Sixth period, however, my mood changed drastically (maybe cause I was finally able to communicate with someone(s). For that class, Gwen sits on my right, and Rachael on my left. I spent all period talking to Rachael about intellectual stuff and to Gwen about how her day was going, and doing tons of work ahead cause I finally got back that derive to work that I had lost all day.   Once I got back home, I could tell immediately that something was at least slightly wrong with my mom. She didn’t have that radiant air (spelling?) about her that she usually does around the time that I get home. Later that night, I found out what was wrong at another of our dreaded “family meetings”: My dad was going on another power trip and had decided sporadically that my mom could no longer be in contact with her best friend, my Aunt Darh-wynn. He was as inanely bull headed about it as he ever is, frustrating me and my sisters beyond measure, and pushing my mom to the brink of tears... again.   Yup, so all in all, today did pretty much suck.  O, and I found out that Gwen’s working on Sat. from 4-10, so I dunno if the movie idea will work out... So far what I had planned (on planning) to do was invite Gwen, Goody, Diane, Andrew, Cam, Josh and Rachael (Cam and I want her to meet Diane) over to my house, and then go from there to see a movie (most likely the Core, if it’s still out). But, since Gwen's working, we might end up doing the same thing, minus her, and then visit her later at work. Dunno, I’m still thinking about it...

      I have a new theme song. It's  urlLink Charlotte Church - All Love Can Be   I will watch you in the darkness Show you love will see you through When the bad dreams wake you crying  I'll show you all love can do All love can do  I will watch through the night  Hold you in my arms Give you dreams where love will be I will watch through the dark 'Til the morning comes All the light I'll take you through the night to see A light showing us all love can be  I will guard you with my bright wings Stay 'til your heart learns to see  All love can be...

      Well Cameran just left, and I'm bored, so I think I'll catch up a little with my posting. Way back on Friday evening (the 18th), [little] Sam's family and Nadia’s family came over. 'Twas fun - we hung out and dled a ton of songs. Later, we took some random pictures and sent them to Cameran (who we were IMing).    On Saturday the 19th, around 3:00, we went to Davison’s (a really good restaurant) and ate lunch, then went back to my Grandmother’s house and had an Easter egg hunt and dessert. We left around 6:30 or 7:00, and [little] Sam came over to my house around 7:15. We messed around for a while, and then drove to Cam’s house where I was going to spend the night. Sam stayed at his house for around ten minutes until my dad left and took him home. Cam, his little bro. Caleb, and I ran around outside, built a six foot fire in his tiny grill, and jumped around on his trampoline from about 10:00 to 11:30. All this time, we were listening to various head-banger songs (Headstrong, Still Frame, Crawling in the Dark, and others…) and talking on phones (me, on my cell, to Gwen, and Cam, on his house line, to Goody). We were trying to convince Goody to come over, but he was to tired and needed sleep before church, the next morning. Cam kept shining my spotlight at passing planes (he lives right by an airport), and we got kinda freaked out when two or three low-flying helicopters started circling the area with spotlights about ten minutes later. Goody (who lives about 8 blocks from Cam) was starting to get edgy too, but then quite suddenly, they just left. I was startled when, about five minutes later, Gwen heard and saw the same helicopters above her house (She lives 8 blocks from me; about 11.4 miles from Cam’s and Goody’s houses) Later, we put the fire out by spraying it with a pressure-washer-velocity hose for 30 seconds, filling the air with little dust particles that got into my contacts, and steam, which cut down vision to about 5 feet. After making our way back to the door, we went inside, ate some really good brownies, and started playing HALO in Cam’s room. Cam was still talking to Goody, but Gwen had to get off for half an hour. When she called me back, we were still playing HALO, Goody had gotten off, and it was around 12:15. I think we finally stopped talking around 1:30, but beforehand, Cam decided it was to cold in his room. He has a rather interesting way of dealing with this: first he clears off his desk (as much as he can), then he pours about 4 ounces of rubbing alcohol onto it and LIGHTS IT… (lol)  He let it burn for a while (prolly 45 seconds total), and believe me, the temperature in the room rose abut three degrees. When we finally decided to go to bed (about 2:15), it was too hot, so he grabbed a huge floor fan from the first floor, and left it running all night. We got into bed at 2:30, but talked for around 2 hours before finally falling asleep.  Sunday the 20th, we woke up at 8:22, 8 minutes before the Rivas’ were to come pick me up. We rushed to get ready, and actually were by 8:30, but Beth was 10 minutes late, so we didn’t have to after all (lol). I didn’t eat anything for breakfast except a huge matzah (spelling?) cracker, and nothing at all to drink until after first service. Then, I drank three glasses of tea, a couple of hot chocolate, and a ton of water (and ate several donuts). I found out that Brady lost his eyesight again right after he woke up that morning, but somehow was able to go get to church without his family noticing… he showed amazing skill by walking around the fellowship hall, after everyone cleared out, bypassing every obstacle that was normally there, but tripping over things that weren’t (like feet and backpacks). Later, after second service, he suddenly got his sight back again. … I don’t really know what to make of it all, but I do agree with Steven – if I were in his shoes, I wouldn’t go walking around like that even if I could, because it just makes people suspicious. Youth church (during second service) was interesting – don’t remember anything about it. (lol) After church was out, Goody, Steven, Peter, Brady, Pat and I went across the street to the Fred Meyer complex and found Cam. We hung around for a little while Steven bought more shoes, and Pat bought a huge sandwich (go figure – he’s always hungry… and he’s nowhere near fat… must have a really fast metabolism). We then headed back over to church, and Gwen called me. I got into the Gadaholts car, still talking, and we drove back over to Fred Meyer. I got off the phone when we got in, ‘cause I knew we needed to be fast and it was going to take a while (I was exchanging a defective airsoft gun). Indeed I was right – they were really busy, and it took more than fifteen minutes. I called Gwen back once we got back in the car, but it was quite hard to hold a conversation ‘cause of all the ambient noise in the car. Hahahaha *Remembering the “Haggis song” that Uncle Greg and Timy made up and kept singing*. Gwen could hear me, and everyone else in the car, but I couldn’t hear her (I tried, I really did). :)  ‘Ne way, I got off the phone when we got to their house, and proceeded to help make lunch (really good, juicy steaks, mashed potatoes, and apple crisp), and to consume much of it :). I got back home around 5:30, and tried to call Gwen back, but she was at work.   Monday the 21st, I got to school and found out that Gwen was sick. – bummer. I called her later that night for some reason that I can’t remember now…  Tuesday the… (oh, never mind), was really fun! I went to the airport by Cam’s and Goody’s houses for an aviation career day (but, *wah* Gwen was still sick, and couldn’t come, and I felt really bad for her). We watched tons of presentations on piloting and ground tech stuff. Then, we went outside on the tarmac for around 45 minutes, and looked at some really sweet small planes and helicopters. The choppers were tight – Lifeflight, cargo, and a couple news choppers. I really want to at least get my private pilot license, and possibly become a CFI (certified flight instructor). When I turn 18, I want to work as ground crew for Southwest Airlines. The pay is decent, but the travel benefits are insane – free travel to anywhere in the continental United States, anytime. I got a ride back to school with Tyler (the only other person from our school to go, other than me and Gwen… well, other than me, since Gwen didn’t go… *wah again*). Before we went back, though, we drove past it, to Wendy’s and tried to use up as much time as would not be questioned before returning. Later, after school, I brought Gwen’s homework to her house (I did on Monday too), and later, right before youth group, she called me wondering about a bible test the next day. I was quite thankful she called me, cause I was oblivious to it, since Bible’s our first period, and I’d skipped first through fifth (out of a total of seven), for the aviation thingy.   I got to youth group about 20 minutes late (no thanks to my parents who wouldn’t even let me go at first...). Worship was tight, though I was only there for 2½ songs… The teaching was... interesting... some really random thing on guy / girl relationships that prolly didn’t make sense to the majority of us... Later, afterward, Ben and I holed ourselves up in the control booth, playing Joy Electric, and MXPX, with some really sweet lighting effects for half an hour. It was kinda funny – none else was in the sanctuary the entire time, and we just spent it getting up to speed on each other’s lives. Ben’s a really neat guy; it’s amazing to see how on fire he is for the Lord. :)  Wednesday, Gwen was still sick :( Chapel was cool; don’t remember anything else about it at all. (lol) Gwen and I talked at some point before 5:00, when Ben came sloshing up to the door. It was pouring out, and he has walked all the way from the bus stop several miles away (he was wearing wool, so he wasn’t cold, just wet. We messed with stuff, and eventually got around to math. My mom took us to midweek around 7:15 (it started at 7:00). Afterward, my mom was more than an hour and 15 minutes late picking me up... really, really, really annoying...  Thursday, Gwen was back! :) We had a test that I kinda out off in Bible... and, well, yeah that’s about it - don’t remember much more about that day.  Friday, we had a special chapel, and our speaker was a Congressman, or Representative... or something (lol). Plus, it was newly instituted (by the students), Caution Tape Day at school. Everything had some type of Caution, Warning, Danger or Police Line Do Not Cross tape on it. I was wearing a Caution tape neck tie, a Warning sash, and a Caution belt. I called Gwen (or she called me...) after school about something (hehe, I’m getting progressively more tired as I write this...).   Growth Group was fun. My small group leader is so tight. We’re almost done with the book we’re studying, and when we’re finished, were going to have an all-nighter called the Hunt for the Perfect Chalupa (spelling?), which basically entails going to every fast food place open at all hours of the night, doing random things, and videotaping it all. One Idea we’ve had is bringing David and Ben along, Ben playing a guitar the entire time, and David singing. We would just walk in as a group, and order stuff, all but the two of them, who would follow directly behind us. Then, we would sit down and eat our meals, and leave, with Ben and David serenading us the entire time. Another Idea is to get an even bigger group of people (we’re 12 strong so far... including Ben and David), and all walking into a Taco Bell, waiting in line as a group, and ordering just one chalupa. Once we got it, the person in the lead would grab it and charge for the door, with the rest of us chasing after him, suddenly yelling the chorus to Hoobastank – Running away.  After growth group, I drove over to Cam’s house and picked him up. We came back home and spent all night uploading random music files and tweaking them. Finally, at around 2am, we played halo for a little while, then passed out. (lol)  Saturday morning, we didn’t really do anything, juss kinda vegged out. Gwen came and picked us up at 3:45, and we rode the mile or so to Adri’s house with her and her mom. We get there, and Cam faded in and out for a couple hours (he was sooo tired – he kept dropping random things when he was making his sub sandwich), and I was wide awake. When it was time for desert, it turned out to be a massive cookie, not a cake (‘twas really good). After we sang, people kept going on and on about my voice... which I thought was kinda odd ‘cause I don’t really esteem my voice to highly, but whatever. (lol)  Later, we watched Zoolander (a very stupid, gay and perverse movie), and played some HALO on Cam’s Xbox. One or two of the girls put on Baby got Back, and started dancing to it... slightly disturbing. Butters, Cam, and I (the only guys) kept our eyes firmly fixed on other parts of the room for a couple minutes. (lol)  Gwen had to leave early (like 8 or something). We watched a Knight’s Tale all the way through, starting at around 9:00 (it’s a 2 hour movie and  the party officially ended at 10:00, but everyone stayed around for the movie – which was good because Adrie doesn’t have a DVD player, and if we left, we would have to take the Xbox with us – oh, and the DVD was Gwen’s). Another random note about the party: Adri’s a crazy pyro. Most of my friends and I are pyros to some extent, but we treat it like a science – asking questions like “how long can I burn this safely without it exploding?” or “ how can I take the ingredients in this firework, and turn it into something that will make a really loud noise, without a considerable risk of shrapnel?”. Then we answer our question. Adri, though... well, she’s just insane about it. She kept chasing people around with candles and lighting things like potato chips on fire. Her mom kept running after her and snapping her with a towel, and she kept lighting thing. (lol...¿) Then Josh got a towel and started snapping the Adri every time she lit something, so her mom left and did some stuff upstairs. (man that was funny).  Cam and I fell asleep around 1:30 the next morning, and woke up about twenty minutes before we had to leave. We picked up Hamid on the way, and arrived at my parent’s church about 3 minutes late. I was SOOO tired during the service... I don’t want to be rude, but it honestly was more boring than usual. I would just have let myself fall asleep like a most of my friends do (sitting all the way in the back), but I was two rows away from the pastor, so I held out as best as I could.   Later, after service, Cam and I saw Josh again, and I introduced Cam to Rachael. It was so funny... Rachael and I were talking for about 5 minutes when Cam suddenly piped up something to the tune of “Man, she’s Diane, exactly.” That kinda took both of us by surprise, and I asked him what he meant. He launched into a detailed explanation of how Rachael’s psyche modeled Diane’s and left just kinda standing there, mouths open, wondering how the heck he could figure all that out so fast... He should be a psychiatrist (lol)

      Through this post, I am just basically appending the April 03rd and 19th posts. I think I may have been giving slightly the wrong impression of the situation with Gwen and me as a whole, through my rather emotional outlook on the whole thing. (Warning: arbitrary assertions to follow – standby for possible recall) :) As far as I can tell, Gwen does like me, but she’s just not sure of what to do with it… much as I am. The whole thing with her asking about dating another person is, in my opinion, completely justified at this point in our relationship. I just think that it surprised me and unnerved me a little when she brought up the question. Keep in mind, also, that these posts were from a viewpoint that has been suppressed for a while – it’s only natural, in an open forum, to give vent to the feelings that I cannot anywhere else. I may not be necessarily feeling as drastically as I am portraying (then again, I might...), but it makes it easier to figure out what I’m feeling myself, by putting my innermost thoughts into writing (and, ironically, laying them bare on a website for all to see).   Btw: on a side note, addressing Steven’s post today; You and Cori have known each other pretty well for almost exactly a year long than I have even known Gwen period. It’s kinda natural that you’d be more comfortable looking at a prospective relationship in the future… But, on the other hand, it seems like Gwen’s looking for a closer relationship sooner in life that Cori is (dating vs. courting), so, I really have no idea. Well, I guess I’ll leave you with that to think on for tonight. Sleep well~

      "See, I'm having the time of my life...  Yes, I'm having the time of my life..." wonderful song - can't get it out of my head (lol)  Back on Tuesday (or was it Wednesday...) night, I called Gwen and asked her about the conversation we had almost a two weeks before. (We almost never talk about our relationship and things involved thereof, in person; perhaps because of lack of time... I know from my side at least, there is a slight intimidation factor involved too.)  The ensuing dialogue went something like this: (please note this is not exact, just as correct as I can remember from a couple days later)  Me: Remember that conversation we had about a week’n a half ago, when you were asking me if it was ok if you date other people? Were you thinking of someone, or were you just wondering randomly? Gwen: Ooh… how to answer… Me: Yeah, It’s kinda a tough question for me to ask as well. Gwen: Yeah, it was a tough question for me to ask too [in reference to the conversation 1½ weeks ago]... I have another person who, kinda wants to go out with me as well, and I just wanted to know that if I did decided I did want to go out with him... I just wanted to know what point we were at.  Right now, I’m just kind of watching both of you, and deciding if I would want to go out with either of you. Me: In a way, I’d actually prefer to be in my shoes. Gwen: Haha… why? Me: Well, I guess I wouldn’t want to have to make a decision. Gwen: Haha, yeah you’re juss chillin’  We continued talking for another twenty minutes or so, mostly about schoolwork, before getting off. The conversation certainly didn’t end as abruptly as the one preceding it, though it left me with more unanswered questions.  I remembered a Biology class, way back around the time of the banquet, when she mentioned offhandedly, that she had actually gotten two invitations to the banquet. Later in the period, she said that it was actually from one of the people in the room with us, but refused to say more, and I didn’t push it.  Looking back on that detail, I found myself starting to wonder who the person was, if I knew them, and how to best size up my “opposition”.  Immediately after, though, I started thinking more along the lines of what true love really entails: is it self serving, or is it putting the other (or others, as the case may be) first?  I really began to think and pray about that for a while, and felt peace that I would be able to cope with it all, either way.  Sure, it would be one of the saddest events in my still young life, after all, she is my first love – and I use that term rather blindly, I still have not come to terms with myself about whether or not I actually am capable of loving her in the truest sense of the word… I mean, well there’s no question about whether or not I’d die for her – I’d do it in a heartbeat, but that’s just a drastic example, not really capable of weighing the delicate balance between “I want a relationship with her because I feel all warm and fuzzy and complete around her”, contrasted to “I want a relationship with her, but I would rather have what is best for her than what is best for me.” i.e. is she wants a relationship with someone else, I would do my absolute best not to stand in their way. Of course this brings up the question of what love actually is: is it a warm fuzzy, self-fulfilling feeling, or is it the complete denial of your own feelings to satisfy the needs of the other?  I’m looking back at that paragraph, and realizing that it’s more just chaotic thoughts that I have written down, and less what I’m feeling in general, so I’m going to write some main point that probably need re-communication:  I. I am completely and totally unsure if I’m ready for a stable relationship yet. II. To the best of my knowledge and my ability to reason, I believe that I truly love Gwen. III. In reference to point I., I have truly no idea how to proceed if she decided that she wants to have a relationship with me. IV. If she does in fact, decide to begin a relationship with the other (currently nameless to me) guy, I will do everything in my power not to stand in her way, including attempting to suppress my feelings for her. (Not that that will be easy, in any way.)  Man, I can’t believe that it took me almost an hour to write this relatively short entry. Actually, I can, considering the content.   Well, it’s already 2:24 a.m., and I’d better be getting off to bed.  Since mostly likely I’m not going to be able to say this to you in the near future, or maybe even ever, I’ll say it now. Gwen, wherever you are (hopefully safe, asleep in bed at this late hour), I love you. Good night.

      Today I went to my parent's church's second service.  Afterward, I stayed for a big banquet they had for Palm Sunday.  I finally got back around 1:30, and got almost immediately on chat.christianlinks.com #youthfire (irc).  Steven was on, and told me about his morning... not the best... at all.  To read more about it, go to  urlLink his blog  .   Yesterday, I fell asleep around 2:30pm, and woke up again around 8:45, when my parents got home, and just walked around, in a daze until around 1:20am, today.   urlLink Mark Schultz - Time Of My Life (my favorite emo song)   He packed his bags when he was just 18 To see a world he thought he'd never seen But he knew when he met her That she was the girl He'd been waiting for  And each night they spent talking on the front porch swing Like it came straight out of a movie scene But one night she stepped out as the sun began to set And when she got to the porch she found a letter that read  You're the only girl I'll ever love And I'd do anything not to give you up If I could only stop the world When you're standing by my side See I'm having the time of my life Yes, I'm having the time of my life  The months went by it was their wedding day A church on a hill, wedding bells rang away She looked like a princess All dressed up in pearls It was her proudest day  And he stood all alone in a darkened church hallway And he got down on his knees and he started to pray He thanked the Lord for his family and the perfect bride But he couldn't hold back what he was feelin' inside And he said  She's the only girl I'll ever love And I'd do anything not to give her up If I could only stop the world When she's standing by my side See, I'm having the time of my life Yes, I'm having the time of my life  Forty years went by and she lived most of God's plan She stood alone in an attic, wedding dress in her hand And she held an old letter written so long ago But she'd never forget it No matter how old  And as she turned to put the dress away And pack up the years He was standing in the doorway With his eyes full of tears And he held her  'Cause you're the only girl I'll ever love And I'd do anything not to give you up If I could only stop the world When you're standing by my side See I'm having the time of my life Yes, I'm having the time of my life

      These are some pics from around 5:00a.m. today:           The beer bottle is actually Henry Weinhard’s root beer, and the gun is a P90 AEG AirSoft™ high caliber, low fps bb gun. (will break windows, but not humans)  Yesterday, I left the house at 12:35, drove to Matt's house, dropped my stuff off, and drove to school to meet Mr. Weber and company. We got to the theater around 3:20, with JR griping the entire way about how we were missing the previews :)  The movie, Anger Management, was quite funny, but more than slightly obscene.    After it was over, Weber drove me back to Matt’s house, where almost everyone was already gathered.  In attendance were, Goody, Matt *umm… yeah*, Steven, Brady, Pat, the other Matt, Adam, Jeremy, Josh, Kevin, and me. Kevin had to leave early, cause he had a double header for baseball the next morning.  We got 7(?) computers up and running, and 4 Xboxs, all LANed, naturally.  Over the course of the night, Steven and I called Sam, and talked collectively for around an hour, most of us worked out, and most of us watched at least one of several movies: Signs, The Ring, Phone Booth, the Legend of Drunken Master, AI, and one other. We played HALO (duh), Tribes I / II, Unreal, Counterstrike, Smash Bros., Red Alert I / II, StarCraft, and many other games. I left this morning, at around 11:30, and have been here, dozing, ever since.

      Bored... is what I am... yeah (lol)  Today, Andy, Chris, and I brought our Xboxs (as intended) and played them through fourth period and much of lunch.  It's kinda funny how many people knew about it without the principle catching wind of it (normally even "T-rated" games are restricted from campus, and all we were playing was HALO, rated "M" for Mature).  It was kinda funny - we checked literally every classroom for extra TVs to set up.    All day (and actually, much of this past week...), Gwen and several other girls have been talking about doing something tonight, and little bits of conversation finally eluded to the fact that they were going to see a movie.  It was kinda strange, they would talk about it for several minutes, quite plainly with me hanging around, and never really once even acknowledging the fact that I was there.  Later, in our last period, Gwen and I were talking about movies that are out.  I mentioned  The Core , and she was like, “Yeah, I might see that tonight”.  After school while I was waiting for the bus, they were getting ready to leave, and a couple of the girls were like “Armaan, you’re not coming?” ...as if they expected me to be.  I juss said that no one invited me, and they left. I was kinda bummed out about that, cause it’s a movie that I really want to see… (of course, the fact that Gwen was going didn’t contribute to it at all ;) ).  So, now I’m just sitting here… home… bored… (lol)  On a lighter note, Mr. Weber (my Bible, and next year, my Chemistry teacher), and several juniors are going to see Anger Management tomorrow at around 2:00.  Then, I’m going to a bday overnighter at Matt’s house until 11:00a.m. Sat.  (no sleep, much Xbox, etc...).  Steven, Goody, Cam, Brady, Josh, and several others will be there.  Should be quite fun. :)

      I'm finally sitting down to begin another little segment of this monolog... Youth group last night was... interesting... I got there half and hour early (and half an hour late - since I was supposed to be there an hour early for setup). The sound booth was... nonexistent - we had to set it up entirely from scratch. The worship was interesting - tons of tech errors and bugs, and we stopped within ten minutes of starting, cause the worship leader thought God was calling us to pray, instead. So, we got into small groups and prayed for quite a while, and later, broke off into Junior High and Senior High. Almost no sooner than I sat down, I had to get back up again and spend like, 20 minutes tearing the entire control booth down again because Eric (a head techie) needed to set up some huge strobes and spotlights.  I just finally got a scan that I like of the picture of Gwen and me at the winter banquet, and will post it tomorrow night, when I'm coherent enough to remember where I saved it. (lol)

      Man, VBasic must really be getting to us... My computer teacher and I are meticulously going over Steven's blog's coding, trying to figure out how to incorporate an [IF] statement into html.  (lol)  Since almost ¼ of the entire high school student body is gone to D.C. for the week, and our class was only six people strong to begin with... Well, we're juss mostly uploading streaming videos of the war, and debugging random pages off the web. :)  Tomorrow, two people from my class (including me) are bringing XBoxs and Andy is bringing one to Weber's Senior Bible class (same period) so we can have an XBox LAN party over the network.

      I'm currently in typing (right after lunch).   Pressure   There is evil all around us, It surrounds us, It abounds.  I hear the raindrops falling On the ceiling All around.  They tell me to be careful For the sky Is angry now.  Lightning flashes, thunders roars, And all around me, The rain still pours. Down on me.  Down on me, always down,  Never ending, constantly  Tormenting my soul From within and from without, It is tearing up my mind. I'm giving out.

      Another random poem that I thought up in pre-Calc and Biology, today.   Of Fire and Ice   Of fire and ice,  Of wind and rain, Scorching, freezing This molten terrain. I can never comprehend The beauty it reveals, in full,   But I know this much; It appeals to many,  But to none so much As the One who created it all.  Of fire and ice, Of wind and rain; Destruction and death, Desires profane. I see them augmenting  The beauty here That was displayed within. Hidden for a while  When filled with sin. But this is not the end.  Of fire and ice, Of wind and rain, Revivals revitalize The hidden, the slain. For in death and destruction,  Life is brought forth To rule and reign o’re All the earth. So, unto the end of ages, And onward, still,  He prevails.

      This is not a comunication of my current feeling - at least not so drastically, its just a random poem I wrote moments ago...  COMFORT  Of all sadness there is none like this Far from bliss or happiness The world all around is closing in Turn around and see  It will never be the same again All anguish and sorrow and grief  Fall upon me as I try to leaf Through this book called the Pages of My Life  Necessity befalls me to throw on my burden Bear it as light, And amidst it all, prepare to fight or flee This coming darkness The true flame That again, shall imprison me. As I begin to burn, you need not think Of sorrow or grief, amidst the roar  For comfort this flame brings Compared to the pain felt before.  Good Night

      I'm going to copy a post from  urlLink Olivia's Blog  that I think was wonderfully written:  Wednesday, March 26, 2003   Have you ever wondered about love? What does it really mean...how do you know if you are in love...the different types and kinds of love...ever wondered these kinds of things? Love is such a complex and amazing thing! Well, it would be, for God is love, and who can comprehend God?   What about the love between to people of the opposite gender? Usually we think of adults, right? It seems to me that teenagers aren't really expected to fall in love. They are supposed to have crushes, flirt, fool around, wish for love, but never actually fall in love. Is this true? Maybe its just a mindset...we've been conditioned to think that we cannot fall in love because we are too young, inexperienced, and immature. Maybe we are just as apt to fall in real love as the ones 10 and 20 and more years older than us.  But how do we know if it is love? How do we discern whether or not it is just a crush, or that we have convinced ourselves to care for someone because we were told they cared for us? How can we know? Are we just the same as those who are older than us? Do they know what falling in love is supposed to be like? Are we all in the same boat?   What are we supposed to do if we think we're in love? It seems that the difference between a simple crush and love is that, besides other factors, if you love someone, you want to care for them, and show them that you love them, and tell them. It is deep...but with a crush, its simply based on lust in one form or another, and you want to keep it secret from that person that you like.   Its so confusing, and complex. Somebody has to tell us how it goes... We only have to wait on God, I suppose. May he tell us quickly.   - Liv, 10:06 PM

      Ah, the dating game – it’s a flawed concept to begin with; falling in “love”, being in “love”, backstabbing, floundering after breaking up, and repeating it all over again, but its also predominantly fun.    Think I’m being double minded? Well, you’re right, I am. That’s cause I still haven’t really come to terms with myself in conjunction with the whole issue yet.  Point in question: Gwen and I.  Late last year she started hanging around me more, and I, being of the masculine gender (i.e. dumb, adj. Conspicuously unintelligent; see stupid), failed to take notice of it for a while.  When it finally clicked *duhum.. I tink purty gurl likez mee*, I started spending more time around her too. We eventually started doing random stuff together outside of school (movies, having lunch together, bringing her to my youth group several times…) and some people started arbitrarily labeling us as dating, though I didn’t think we were and I think (hope… wonder… whatever) that she didn’t either.  Winter Banquet (see my archives – January 18th) was fun, and we both had a good time. Her dad wanted to meet me first before I took her, so I had lunch at her house back in December, and he and I talked for a while.  I thought it was cool that he cared enough about her to do that, and I started to get to know him (he’s a nice guy), but the general feeling I was getting from Gwen was that she was embarrassed about the whole thing.  (Haha – I probably would be too, in her shoes).  We continued doing random things together into February, though in the last month or so we’ve been starting to get a little distant. She’s constantly to busy to come to youth group, and we haven’t done anything together by ourselves at all except a U.S. History project that we worked on together. (She taught me how to sew! *yay!* Well, sorta – I’m terrible at it *lol*)   I’ve also noticed that I’ve been acting kinda weird with the whole situation too – the most predominant instance that I can think of right now, was back on March 16th, at Melissa’s house.  We had just turned on a movie, and I was one of the first people to sit down.  I was just expecting, by default, that Gwen would want to sit beside me, but instead, she went over to another part of the room and sat beside Butters, who had been acting overtly flirtatious the entire night (I later found out that he was on some type of pain medication, and didn’t even remember the majority of that night.). It may have been the fact that I was depressed to begin with, or it may have be the fact that I noticed Butters holding her hand for a while (or both), but whatever the reason, I just decided it was easier to not worry about it. So I just spaced out for a while, in fact, the only parts that I remember from that point until the end of the movie were several times when Gwen was trying playfully to get Butters not to watch the screen during some supposedly bad parts. (I wouldn’t know whether they were actually bad or not – I wasn’t exactly coherent.) Anyway, a while after the movie was done, Gwen came over and asked if I was okay, and rubbed my back for a second. I replied “yes” (lie) so she wouldn’t worry about it. She didn’t, and I forced myself to cheer up and actually did have a good time for the rest of the party.   In the car on the way home Adrie (her parents were taking both me and Gwen home) asked us if we were officially going out yet, or what the nature of our relationship was. We all talked for a little while, and arrived at the conclusion that we were not dating, but that we (Gwen and I) should talk more about the subject later. We did on im the next Tuesday:  Me: hey I've been thinking a lot over the past couple days about that   rather brief conversation we had in Adrie's car the other day... Me: and I was wondering something Me: how do you see our relationship in terms of what you would want it to be?  i.e. do you like it the way it is right now? Me: sorry, that was kinda out of the blue... Gwen: right now it may be best to get to know each other as friends rather than go into an unstable relationship at this time.  Me: o good Me: I was hoping you were thinking along those lines Me: that's exactly how I have been feeling Gwen: thought so  What was the point of all this?  Well, in our last period class today, she randomly said she needed to talk to me tonight.  I though that probably didn’t mean something good, and was correct.  At 7:17, she called my cell, and we had around a five minute conversation. She made reference to the conversation above and asked if that meant I was okay with her dating another guy. I told her that there should be no true reason why I couldn’t adjust to it over time, but that I would be rather disheartened at first. She asked why, and I answered because I had hoped that we were heading for a closer relationship in the near future. We sorta ended on that note, her saying that she’d let me get back to my homework, and me saying that I’d see her tomorrow.    Now re-read the first two paragraphs of this post and you’ll see kinda what I mean…  Listening to: Saliva – Always (ironically the song that Andy and I kept listening to, to and from a field trip to Oregon City this morning) Feeling:  umm… lol, read the lyrics - listen to the song - whatever   urlLink  Saliva - Always     I hear... a voice say "Don't be so blind"...  it's telling me all these things...  that you would probably hide...  am I... your one and only desire...  am I the reason you breathe...  or am I the reason you cry...    Always... always... always... always... always... always... always...  I just can't live without you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't get around you...  I breathe you...  I taste you...  I can't live without you...  I just can't take any more...  this life of solitude...  I guess that i'm out the door...  and now i'm done with you...    I feel... like you don't want me around...  I guess i'll pack all my things...  I guess i'll see you around...  Its all... been bottled up until now...  as I walk out your door...  all I hear is the sound...    Always... always... always... always... always... always... always...  I just can't live without you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't get around you...  I breathe you...  I taste you...  I can't live without you...  I just can't take any more...  this life of solitude...  I guess that i'm out the door...  and now i'm done with you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't live without you...    I left my head around your heart...  Why would you TEAR MY WORLD APART?...    Always... always... always... always...    I see... the blood all over your hands...  does it make you feel... more like a man...  was it all... just a part of your plan...  the pistol's shakin' in my hands...  and all I hear is the sound...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't get around you...  I breathe you...  I taste you...  I can't live without you...  I just can't take any more...  this life of solitude...  I guess that i'm out the door...  and now i'm done with you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't live without you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't live without you...  I just can't take any more... this life of solitude...  I pick myself off the floor...  and now i'm done with you...  Always... Always...  Always...   The night is still young - I have much to do.

      My family is dysfunctional.   Ok, I’ll elaborate… If you’re reading this blog, chances are you know what I’m taking about, but I’ll overview it anyway.  Without going into a large amount of detail (which, I would estimate, would take several hundred pages to write, or several days to dictate orally), I will try to explain as best I can some more recent events.  I’ve always viewed my dad as an angry person, from as far back as some of my earliest memories, but these last nine months or so have revealed just how deep that anger problem went.  There was a time, at the end of last summer, when my mom was in tears at LEAST two times a day, for almost a month on end (this was all from verbal abuse from my dad).  To cut a very long monolog short, the pinnacle of evidence of my dad’s anger came about a week or two before Christmas last year.  (My family situation was so bad throughout December, that I skipped celebrating my birthday, the 18th, until late January.)  It was at that time that his problem finally came out into the open, and they started going to marriage counseling.  It has had a drastic difference, I can tell, and I’m quite proud of him because of it, but it hasn’t come without its own share of problems.  For instance, one thing that we have started to do is have formal family meetings to try to create a stable forum for communication (something that we have never had before).  The first several had their share of hitches, but were predominantly effective.  …Not so with this last one.  We had a meeting today starting about 9:25, and expected to last one hour.  Within the first five minutes, however we launched into a trivial argument that I exited 25 minutes later by excusing myself from the table, and amid my dad yelling how terrible a child I was being, and demanding that I come back down and sit at “my place” at the table before he “counted to three”.  (It’s almost comical, actually, if you don’t take into account my two crying sisters, my sullen mom, and the fact that now he won’t let me go to a play tomorrow night because of my being “stubborn” and “rebellious”.)  Make no mistake, it wasn’t just my dad’s fault, my mom was the one who started the argument in the first place, and the one that was being the most controlling.    Other than this wonderful development, my day has been relatively uneventful.  My Spring Break was quite fun. On Monday, Steven came over around noon, and went to Butter’s house with me from 4:00 to around 11:30.  The Neff troop, Gwen, Adrie, and a couple other people were there.  It was kinda interesting the first hour or so – we were all tired, and for some reason we decided to go up t the Gadeholts house, and bother Kat and Timy several times.  ‘Twas funny.  We watched LotR, cracking Gandalf the Gay jokes all night long, even while were watching the Patriot later.  We went to a park around 10:30, and had fun running around in the dark… (at least I think we had fun…) lol.  Steven and I stayed up till around 4:00am that night (morning?) and woke up around 9 the next day. :)  We went to a really cool piano shop, and saw / played some really really “top-of-the-line” pianos, and learned interesting, but relatively useless info about them (like, did you know that all the string combined exert more than 20 tons of force on the inside of a piano?)  Later that night we went to youth group, and Steven went back to his house afterward.   Wednesday, at 5:00, I hosted a large xbox lan party.  In attendance were Pat, Steven, Andy, Andrew, Brady, Goody, David, Mark (I hope that’s his name… lol), and Cameran. We debated going out and throwing rocks at windows of friends residing nearby at pre-dawn hours, but nothing came of it.  Everyone was gone by 4:00 Thursday, and I decided I needed sleep, but didn’t get much.  On Friday, Brady, Cori, and Mrs. Lee picked me up at around 2:00, and then we went and acquired Cameran from his abode.  I don’t remember much about Friday afternoon (but that’s okay ‘cause I videotaped a large amount of it), on account of sleep deprivation.  I do recall playing HALO for quite a while though, and eating some really rich chocolate cake that Cori brought back from her growth group.  Cori finally went to bed past 1:30 (she had work at 8:00 the next morning), and Cam, Brady and I ran around for a while, outside.  We kept going outside, and making random videos involving little dancing chipmunks, and alternately going back inside and watching random movies (including the Princess Diaries, and some Ernest movies, before we got scared by what we thought was a cougar.  At around 5:00, we went back outside and repaired a tree house.  I think we sat around bored for an hour after that, then woke Cori up at 6:30 and showed her some of the footage of us being weird that we took over the night.  (lol)  She left at 7:30, and we started riding a go-cart around. Including a break for lunch (really good homemade pizza), we ended up riding that go-cart for more than 6 hours, and we had to refill it twice.  I was so stinking tired on the way home, I couldn’t think, like at all.  Cori, Mrs. Lee, and I were discussing conspiracy theories, and I had to really concentrate to even comprehend what they were saying.  Quite funny.  I got back to my house around 6:30, walked around in a daze for ten minutes, went up to my room, closed the door, turned on the tv (the stereo, computer, and lights were already on), laid down the wrong direction on my bed, woke up 12 hours later, changed, brushed my teeth, took off my glasses (lol), and finally got in bed.  Sunday, I went to my parent’s church, and hung out with my Grandma and sisters all afternoon.    Monday – nothing substantial  Tuesday, we had guests over, and I got to youth group almost half an hour late. So late, in fact, that I just stayed in the Sanctuary, and watched Stages' final dress rehearsal before the debut of Song on the Mountain tomorrow.  Today, I went to the dentist after school, and Ben came over late. Later, I missed midweek, so I could be part of the wonderful family meeting, and that’s about where I am now.   This was finished at 10:13, but I have been hindered from posting it until now.

      Ok, this post is going to be really random, cause I'm just writing it sporadically while skipping study hall, 5th period.  On Monday, my mom took Gwen and me to the library to get some books for a small report due on Tues. on the way back home, we stopped at several animal hospitals to post lost cat signs - one of our two cats has been gone for a week. :(  Afterward, we stopped at Subway to grab some... well subs. (lol) Oh, haha the couple times we had gotten into the car before Subway, my mom kept reminding me to open the door for Gwen... trouble was, I wasn't sure where she wanted to sit, so I opened the wrong door. :) Then, when my mom drove up to the Subway to pick us up, I looked at Gwen and marched up to the door acting all *pompous* and *gentlemen-like*, and the door was locked! (She was still laughing about that at lunch this afternoon. ;)  Youth group was fun last night. Jamie was there! - First time I've seen her in almost a year:)... now if we could only get Bwitty back... (Lol)  o.O Gwen was there too finally :):) I did the overheads for worship, and the laptop kept freezing up! So annoying... 'Ne way, the Senior High youth leaders were gone on vacation, so my small group leader taught. It was basically an open forum for discussing topics that he brought up. After youth group, we stopped at Arbies on the way back home. My mom stayed in the car, and Gwen and I went in to buy milkshakes... dang the guy behind the counter was really tired. :) Interesting experience.  I'm talking to our SBP, Jason at the other end of the room... he's been living a really fast paced schedule  this school year.  Btw, my cable modem is screwed up, so I won't post anything for a little while except from school.

      Two of the most touching songs in my life right now (and, most likely, of all the student body at my school):     Breathe     This is the air I breathe  This is the air I breathe  Your holy presence  Living in me   This is my daily bread  This is my daily bread  Your very word  Spoken to me   And I............. I'm desperate for You. And I............. I'm lost without You.          Surrender - Marc James     I'm giving You my heart and all that is within I lay it down for the sake of You my King I'm giving You my dreams, I'm laying down my rights I'm giving up my pride for the promise of new life   And I surrender all to You, all to You And I surrender all to You, all to You   I'm singing You this song, I'm waiting at the cross And all the world holds dear I count it all as loss For the sake of knowing You For the glory of Your name To know the lasting joy Even sharing in Your pain   And I surrender all to You, all to You And I surrender all to You, all to You

      Amazing...  Yup, that’s the only way to describe it – These last two days have made a change in my life that I hope I will never forget.   Yesterday, we met at the high school campus at just before 8 o’clock. We left shortly there after, and I spent the bus ride (about 1½ hours) sitting beside Gwen, playing badgamen (spelling?), and several different types of card games for the majority of the time. We got to the camp, unloaded our stuff, and walked out onto the beach (not just the two of us, for that’s against school rules *lol*), and recorded random people doing random things (I brought my camcorder – *yay*). I had to go help serve lunch pretty much right away, so I headed back to the cafeteria in around 20 minutes while Gwen and Lisa (her best friend at school) walked all the way out a huge rock about ½ to ¾ a mile up the shoreline that everyone’s taken to congregating at. I attempted to help out but they already had enough sophomore volunteers (the sophomores were in charge of serving lunch), so I tried to get to the back of the line. For some reason, one of the staff members of the camp told me not to go all the way around, but to just get into line right there, so I was the third person out of 145 (approx.) to get food *lol*. After we were done eating, we all headed across the small field / play structure / basketball court to the chapel hall.   Ok, hands down, I was not prepared for that chapel. I am usually a fairly introverted person when it comes to things like raising my hands when singing, and for that matter, even singing with my full voice: but not so yesterday and today... I was totally into the worship, and wasn’t at all apprehensive about letting the whole room know it. (The awesome thing about it is that basically everyone in the room was acting the same way too, pretty out of character for my school.)  After a brief message from ...some people... (I don’t remember who), we headed out for what was supposed to be organized games outside, but the constant shifting every hour from a 60º torrential downpour, to 82º blazing (relatively) sun kinda put a damper on that idea. Instead, people broke off into a several big groups, two of which went out and played the traditional beach football and walked to the rock again, respectively. I was in the “rock” group. Everyone messed around for a while, while I recorded their antics (Butters trying to throw huge sticks... or small logs... at a rock ledge more that 80 feet away, Trevor getting pelted with huge dirt clods, and people juss generally having a good time.) Oh, Gwen got a really cool picture on her camera of Grace, Young Hee, Butters and me, positioned in such a was on the rock that it looked like Young Hee and I were standing in Grace’s hand, and Butters, in mine.  Close to 4:30, the juniors, of whom Gwen is one, went back to the cafeteria to set up the decorations for the traditional “mystery dinner”, which turned out to be, not a ‘70s theme, but an ‘80s prom theme... but I’ll get to that in a minute... ‘Ne way, I was trailing behind Danielle and Gwen, who had made off with my jacket, and run a considerable length down the beach, back toward camp. As I was attempting to get my cameras in order and run to catch up to them (something they were trying to prevent by looking back frequently and running forward a little when I got too close), and something suddenly distracted me. Completely forgetting about requiring my possession, I veered left, up onto a sand dune, and sat down and started praying and singing.  I was doing this for a while (prolly close to ten minutes), before Gwen noticed I wasn’t trailing them anymore, and came looking for me. (I found out later that she thought I was sad or distressed about something by the way I was sitting, from a distance... hehe :) far from it - God is amazing.) She gave me back the jacket, and I just stayed there for another several minutes before the next wave of my peers came walking back from the rock. I got up and joined them, and several of us (Trevor, Butters, another freshman and I) grabbed part of Butter’s stack of explosives and combustibles, and set some stuff on fire over by a little river’s outlet into the ocean.  Later, most of the guys in our little “rock group” went back to the massive sophomore / junior guy's cabin (actually a converted gathering hall), and watched my video up to that point, and listened to cds for quite a while. Then, we went to the senior cabins and watched the senior guys punch each other until they blacked out. ...umm... smart... yeah...  The dinner was fun. We all got into two lines outside of the cafeteria: girls on the right, boys on the left, with seniors in the front, sophomores in the middle, and freshmen in the back. When the juniors opened the doors, we realized that members of the opposite gender were going seat us individually. Secretly I was hoping that by some ironic Devine calculation, the lines would match up and Gwen would seat me, but no, when I walked into the door of the “banquette hall”, my arm was draped through Ali’s, not Gwen’s (whatever... it was for like, five seconds anyway *lol*).  The skit if you will was based on a prom, complete with the crowning of seniors for different things. Later when we were eating, Gwen came over to our table and danced a little to the ‘80s music filling the room. Hehe, I got a picture of her in the light blue green dress and that *cute* little pigtail or whatever that she was wearing off to the side of her hair.   Later, we had another chapel that was really my highlight of the trip. You could almost feel the Spirit of Christ flowing through the room as a tangible entity... I was completely broken down at one point, kneeling before the “alter”, with my face on the ground, weeping, crying out to God, begging Him to lift this burden of thoughts and deeds off my back. As I was singing again, I felt a sudden peace rush over me, and a wonderful feeling of ease and comfort and the knowledge that God was there to help me (Me, o wretched sinner that I am... to think that He’d love me... I cannot even begin to fathom it.). As soon as this happened, I couldn’t stop thanking God, it was like I literally couldn’t stop. I gave no heed to what was going on around me; singing or praying or both, I don’t remember, but I just kept praising God under my breathe for what seemed like seconds, but Gwen told me later that it was quite a while.   I can’t remember right now exactly when our Student-Body-President’s sermon was, in relation to the worship, but it was really cool. He was talking about how Jesus has called us individually to Him, and how His word should he like honey to our eyes. We should treat it as such – hungering and thirsting for it as we do for our physical food. He had a couple honey jars (jugs, pots, little plastic things that you squeeze?) passed around the room, and we were supposed to put a drop on our finger and lick it off when he said too. The illustration behind this was another illustration - apparently when young Jewish children would start to memorize the Torah (at age 5 or 6 or something...) the Rabbis would coat their slates in honey to represent physically, what we should think about what it teaches us spiritually.  Once he was done, we continued worshiping till around 11:30, and broke off the get some snacks and other things, the go to bed. I was still in a daze from the singing, and just got out the door, closed my eyes, and walked, thinking about the night. Next thing I know, I was at the base of the massive sand dune that borders the beach. I walked up it and just gazed at the water for a time, then headed back to my cabin, then to the cafeteria to grab some apples, then back into the fellowship room to grab all the stuff I left in there, then said goodnight to Gwen, and headed back to out mega cabin.   I finally got to sleep about on 1½ hours later, when we duct taped Alex’s mouth shut, and his hands and feet together.  I woke up at 6:30, got up, got dressed, and headed over the cafeteria for Chi Alpha (the school’s bible study that usually meets on Thursday mornings). Once that was over, I ate breakfast, went for a run on the beach, and made a trip back to our cabin. Once I got back to the cafeteria, I immediately noticed that Gwen was  finally  up (well, she has an excuse – she took a shower). We got over to the chapel, where we spent not 1½ as originally intended, but three hours, during which, we had even more worship, and this really tight bus drive named Roland played his harmonica with the band.  Then we made the speediest exit in Faith Bible history (after the longest chapel in Faith Bible history, on a retreat with the least amount of people not there in Faith Bible history), packing, taking pictures on the sand dune, cleaning the cabins, loading the U-Haul, and boarding the buses all in under 25 minutes.  Once we were clear of Wi-Ne-Ma soil, we headed north several miles to Tillamook, home of the Tillamook Cheese Factory. We at lunch in the Factory (which is actually a museum of cheese, and once again, I found it funny that we completely overran the place with Faith Kids. :)   Hehe, I got some good pictures of Gwen, with sunglasses on, sticking her tongue full of ice cream, out at the video camera.  On the bus ride home, I sat beside Gwen again, playing more card games and other random things. Oh, Butters and Josiah were on one of the other busses (there were four total), and we made use of my and Josiah’s FRS radios to talk to each other the entire way home.   ________________________________________________________    Something offhand that stood out to me was a comment that Gwen made on the bus on the way back home: Adam was really tired, and was sitting in the isle beside Gwen, resting his head on her leg. She had been bending down rubbing his hair and massaging his back for quite a while, and she randomly looked up at me and said something along the lines of: “Armaan, don’t get jealous, I’ve massaged your back too before.” She meant it in jest, I know, and, if I remember correctly, she was also wrong – she hasn’t given me a backrub before (...well, except at Young Hee’s party, but that was only enough time for her to ask me if I was ok, and me to lie in response that I was). But, no matter whether she was right or not, it got me thinking about us over the last day or so. I’d hugged her three times in less than an hour (and we never hug – we may have done it six times since we’ve known each other), and throughout the retreat, she had been acting affectionate toward other guys (mostly comforting them during worship), and now she was giving Adam a backrub. ...ok anyway... the point I’m trying to make is this: There was that retarded micro paranoia of mine about showing physical affection toward her that I think I might have suddenly gotten over, and then there was that stupid territorial mentality that had been keeping me distant whenever she was interacting a large amount with other guys, that God, I think, helped me through too.   Oh, one other slightly insightful random thing that I wanted to mention: When I got into the chapel this morning, I was looking around for a little while, and couldn’t find Gwen, so I sat down in the back row like we’d been doing before. Lisa noticed me sitting back there, by myself, and invited me to sit with her and Adam, so I switched spots to sit there. Then, looking around the room from my new vantage point, I spotted Gwen, but she already had Josh (a senior) and Young Hee sitting beside her. I juss assumed that she didn’t want to sit by me, like sometimes happens in the chapels at school, so didn’t do anything. Later though, after chapel she acting indignant - almost annoyed that I didn’t sit beside her. That was kinda the first direct indication I’d gotten in a while that she wasn’t just putting up with me sitting next to her all the time, but that she actually wanted me too, so that sorta made my day slightly happier (how it got happier from what it was, I do not know... maybe happy is relative - you can always have more... hmmm must ponder that.  On a similar note, I had a great time at Gwen’s youth group on Wednesday. I met Kevin and we seemed to hit it off without a problem (at least I like him...). *lol* I also met several other of Gwen’s friends, one of whom offered me a Krispy Kreme doughnut, and another, slightly quirkier one, who seemed to have a controversial opinion on... well, everything (lol). I prolly wasn’t helping much though, since I was so tired, and would say stupid things that would egg her on. Worship was sweet, and the teaching was tight. We watched two video clips: part of some REALLY random movie, and part of Braveheart. Her mom came to pick us up, and as we left, I waved to Kevin, and he waved back, smiling.  Funny, even I, in all my optimism, didn’t think the night would end that way. (Well actually, it didn’t end there – Gwen still had to ask her mom if I could come over and help her make brownies, her mom still had to say that she was too tired and take me home, and Gwen still had to come in for a couple minutes and say hi to my mom before she could leave, and the night would really be over) *lol*   Ok, I’m really dizzy for lack of sleep, and even though this says that I’m posting on Friday, I added a ton of stuff, and finished at 2:16 a.m. Saturday.

      I just found out that I’m going to Gwen’s youth group tonight, and that that one other guy (...Kevin? lol, I can’t remember) is going to be there. Gwen’s slightly worried that we’re going to be at each other’s throats all night, but I actually want to meet him. Whatever... We’ll see how it goes...  Josh, Trevor, Derek and I are getting together at Trevor’s house to construct some... *pop*ers for the retreat tomorrow. Oh, I tested the air horn last night at youth group: vewwie vewwie loud. :):)

      Some random quotes from an email that Brianna sent me:  "You don't love a woman because she is beautiful, but she is beautiful because you love her." -Unknown "If you love somebody, let them go. If they return, they were always yours. If they don't, they never were." -Unknown "Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get, it's what you are expected to give -- which is everything." -Unknown "We perceive when love begins and when it declines by our embarrassment when alone together." -La Bruyere "Perfect love is rare indeed - for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise, the flexibility of the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain." -Leo Buscaglia "Sympathy constitutes friendship; but in love there is a sort of antipathy, or opposing passion. Each strives to be the other, and both together make up one whole." -Samuel Taylor Coleridge "All thoughts, all passions, all delights Whatever stirs this mortal frame All are but ministers of Love And feed His sacred flame." -Samuel Taylor Coleridge "Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship - never." -Charles Caleb Colton "Immature love says: 'I love you because I need you.' Mature love says 'I need you because I love you.'" -Erich Fromm "Looking back, I have this to regret, that too often when I loved, I did not say so." -David Grayson "At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet." -Plato  These two are powerful: "Absence is to love what wind is to fire; it extinguishes the small, it enkindles the great." -Comte DeBussy-Rabutin "If you judge people, you have no time to love them." -Mother Theresa

      O.o  I love that song that Steven posted on  urlLink his blog     urlLink Blessed Union Of Souls - Hey Leonardo (She Likes Me For Me)   She don't care about my car  She don't care about my money  And that's real good because I don't got alot to spend  But if I did it wouldn't mean nothin'   She likes me for me  Not because I look like Tyson Beckford  With the charm of Robert Redford  Oozing out my ears  But what she sees  Are my faults and indecisions  My insecure conditions  And the tears upon the pillow that I shed   She don't care about my big screen  Or my collection of DVD's  Things like that just never mattered much to her  Plus she don't watch to much t.v.   And she don't care that I can fly her  To places she ain't never been  But if she really wants to go  I think deep down she knows that  All she has to say is when   She likes me for me  Not because I hang with Leonardo  Or that guy who played in "Fargo"  I think his name is Steve  She's the one for me  And I just can't live without her  My arms belong around her  And I'm so glad I found her once again   And I'm so glad I found her once again  And I'm so glad I found her once again  Gazing at the ceiling  as we entertain our feelings in the dark  The things that we're afraid of are gonna show us  what we're made of in the end   She likes me for me  Not because I sing like Pavarotti  Or because I am such a hottie  I like her for her  Not because she's phat like Cindy Crawford  She has got so much to offer  Why does she waste all her time with me  There must be something there that I don't see   She likes me for me  Not because I'm tough like Dirty Hairy  Make her laugh just like Jim Carrey  Unlike the Cable Guy  But what she sees  Is that I can't live without her  My arms belong around her  And I'm so glad I found her once again  Found her once again  I'm so glad I found her once again  On again

      Listening to: Chevelle - “Closure”. Feeling: apathetic, slightly bored, ineffectual.  I woke up the first time around 7:10 this morning and drifted in and out of consciousness for around 2 hours, and finally got up when my dad got back home from a meeting.  He took me out to get a haircut for my school’s upcoming retreat to Wi-Ne-Ma on the beach. I got home around 11:30, took a shower, ate lunch, and headed back out the door for a piano recital. I came into that fairly unprepared, but surprised myself by doing a better job than I thought I would. I got back here about half an hour ago, and immediately got into Youthfire Chat (chat.christianlinks.com #youthfire, or  urlLink here  for all those people out there without an IRC client). I'm signed in for about ¾ of every day as The_Fire_Breathes.  Let me see here... *sits back and tries to recall the events of the last week or so...   The trip to Wi-Ne-Ma is next Thursday and Friday. For both the trips per year, one of the upper classes hosts the dinner on Thursday night. The fall on is the seniors, The Spring one (this next one) is the juniors.  It was quite funny last year: I was only taking two classes, and naturally, I wasn’t as up on the proceedings of the school as everyone else was, plus a lot of people didn’t know me. So, when I wandered into the meeting room that the juniors were setting up, no one questioned me, and I had no reason to assume that I wasn’t supposed to be there. I just hung out the entire time that they were setting up, and it took me until after all the other classes were formally ushered in, to realize that I wasn’t supposed to be there :)  Anyway, the juniors have been confining themselves into one classroom during lunch, more often than not over the last three weeks, and I’m really interested in what they’re going to have set up.  Josh and I might make a Piccolo-Pete bomb and bring it, but we don’t know yet... I got a new 1,000,000 candle power spotlight on top of the other identical one, and the 3,000,000 candle power one that I already have. I might get a 6 cell MagLite, and high intensity LED headset before then too. Oh, yeah... back to pyrotechnics... modded lighters, WD-40, small street firecrackers, and possibly some air horns (not really pyrotechnical, but they’re still stinkin’ fun).  Student council elections were several days ago, and I wanted to run, but I decided not too since I still wasn’t sure if I was going to be a junior or senior next year. (I have finally decided to take a huge burden off my shoulders over the summer by not graduating a year early, but I didn’t decide until two days after the elections.) I’m going to hate myself throughout the entirety of this upcoming school year, for that decision, but I think it’s for the better in the long run.

      What’s been going on over the past week? Hmm… I think I’ll start with the more recent events that I remember more about.  1. Gwen’s on a several-week long mission trip up to a Native American reservation up in a southern province of Canada with her church. She left around 6:00 am, Friday morning, and is getting back mid-July. I was hoping to spend a while talking to her on Thursday night, but it didn’t work too well: My dad had previously decided that if my room wasn’t clean in the morning, I would have to forfeit phone usage that evening. That was... kinda fine with me, but that’s beside the point. I had told him the night before, that even if my room wasn’t clean, I still wanted to use the phone because it would be the last time I’d be able to talk to Gwen in three weeks. He agreed, but I eventually did get time to clean my room anyway. The next morning, he said it looked “clean, but it could use a little more work later.” Then, that evening, about ten minutes after Gwen called me, he yelled down at me from the landing above our office to get off the phone and that he had told me not to be on it. I tried to call up to him that that wasn’t what he had communicated to me several times beforehand, but he wouldn’t listen… He kept telling me simply to get off and not use it again the entire night, and when I would ask him why he would just reply by yelling louder at me. I started yelling back at him and this went on and on for a while, until he just turned around and slammed the door behind him as he stomped into his room. I realize now that I prolly shouldn’t have been yelling back at him, especially with Gwen on the phone still, and I need to apologize to her when I talk to her again. Anyway, she and I resumed talking again, but less than ten minutes later, he picked up his phone and demanded why I was still on: launching into this entire campaign about how rebellious I was being and that we had agreed that this was a punishment for not keeping my room clean (something we have, in fact not done) and just generally going on and on about how bad I was. Finally I convinced him that I was going to get off and he hung up. Not more than two seconds later though, he picked up the phone again and started yelling at me again that I wasn’t off yet and that he needed to use the phone. After a little while, he got off again and Gwen and I said a rather awkward goodbye, and that was it. Well, that’s my dad for yah.  2. I went JETSKIING all day Saturday with my uncle. :) :)  I got up around 8:00 to be ready to go by 9:30, but my mom randomly came up with an hour-an’-a-half worth or work to do before I could go (vacuuming the entire house and such), so we actually got going around 11. We walked around downtown and went back to his house where we listened to some Red Hot Chili Peppers on his 15 grand high end stereo system (fricken’ purest tone I’ve ever heard from a recording). Later, we met up with his girlfriend’s family on the Columbia River and enjoyed a LONG afternoon from 1 till past 9 of jetskiing and wonderful Russian fish and stuff. (her family’s all Russian). After sundown, the river (more than a mile wide) was sooo calm. We could push 50mph for an easy 2 mile stretch without getting bumped around too much.   3. I went to Cameran’s house after church with Steven and Brady today (well, now actually yesterday). We mostly juss hung out, swam, played Halo and jumped on his trampoline. ‘Twas quite fun. Toward 8 or so, we walked (me and Steven barefoot) over to my best friend, Goody’s house and sat around outside for like twenty minutes and walked back. Later, my mom and my aunt picked me and Steven up and took us to home after Taco Bell. We were talking about this one abuse support group that Steven and I are thinking about joining, and I’m finding myself more interested in it day by day. Whatever… we’ll see what comes of it… Oh yeah, and there was some huge issue that went on at home today again, that basically necessitated my mom leaving and hiding out somewhere from right after church (like 1-ish) till when we finally got back home (like 11:00). Man, I wish more than anything that my family problems would just disappear and that we’d be a normal healthy family, but I don’t ever even see that as a possibility until way way after I’ve moved out. It saddens me.  Goodnight all, and sleep well. (especially Gwen)

      You know, in looking back on this past school year with Gwen, I’ve come to the rather stark realization of how strangle I’ve acted when at school. Let me preclude this by saying that these last 12 months have been the most stressful in my entire life. Bearing that in mind, I can begin to see just how radically different my mannerisms… no, my personality was affected. All the tension and pressure was constantly building up at home, growing greater and greater every day… I felt with every turn of the second hand on the clock I was being crushed… enveloped in despair, entwined in regret, torn between conflicts of my conscience and my love for both my parents, warranted or not, it was there to stay. Crushing, crushing, always crushing, never letting up, compressing my being into a tiny ego incapable of feeling emotion because of some self-inflicted wall that I put up that kept me from getting close to anyone. Through all of this, school was my only constant… my only vent… and how did I vent all this emotional stress? By closing myself up and pulling back from all around me, of course. I was a walking, living, breathing, pile of depressed flesh… nothing more. Trouble was, I had become VERY good at hiding it over the years, and to a person that did not know me exceedingly well, I was fine. I was wallowing through school (or lack there of… I didn’t try at all the entire year: barely squeaking by with a GPA for the year of 3.14) for the first several months until around November or something when I started to get to know Gwen better… To this day I still can’t remember who started going out of their way to spend more time with the other and get to know them, but I’m fairly sure it was her, being as my emotional state and corresponding people skills were hovering very slightly above that of a rock’s. Man, she’s been such a blessing to life in more ways than I will probably ever know. Whether she knows it or not, she was the one person who was able to break through my massive facade, that huge false pretense that all was well with me, and start to brighten my life. It wasn’t like it was a drastic change all at once: no, it was more a gradual breaking away from that impersonal shell that I felt acted as a shield to me. In the latter months right before school ended, this resulted in me acting openly depressed and hard to live with (annoying and such)… something I’m not proud of… but I guess that’s what it took to break me out of the bleak barrier that I was cowering under. As I said before, God’s really blessed me with her, and I’ve never really communicated that to her. I love her with all my heart, but I still have a ton of lingering interpersonal issue that prevent me from telling her how I really feel about her, no matter how much my heart yearns for me too… I want to scream my love for her, but I guess this blog is the closest I’ll be able to come to that for a while… I guess through all the suffering and tribulation I’ve been going through does have a purpose, though I certainly can’t see it no matter how far ahead I strain to peer into the far reaches of time and find that more and more, I have to rely on God.  Ok, this post was really random, and prolly doesn’t flow well… Summary: I love Gwen and I’ve never told her how much of an impact she’s had on my life in the last several months.

      More country music...   Concrete Angel   She walks to school with the lunch she packed Nobody knows what she's holdin' back Wearin' the same dress she wore yesterday She hides the bruises with linen and lace  The teacher wonders but she doesn't ask It's hard to see the pain behind the mask Bearing the burden of a secret storm Sometimes she wishes she was never born  Through the wind and the rain She stands hard as a stone In a world that she can't rise above But her dreams give her wings And she flies to a place where she's loved Concrete angel  Somebody cries in the middle of the night The neighbors hear, but they turn out the lights A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate When morning comes it'll be too late  Through the wind and the rain She stands hard as a stone In a world that she can't rise above But her dreams give her wings And she flies to a place where she's loved Concrete angel  A statue stands in a shaded place An angel girl with an upturned face A name is written on a polished rock A broken heart that the world forgot  Through the wind and the rain She stands hard as a stone In a world that she can't rise above But her dreams give her wings And she flies to a place where she's loved Concrete angel

      I have just started listening to country music this last week at work, and have already found a couple songs I really like:   Andy Griggs - "She's More"   I like blue eyes, hers are green. Not like the woman of my dreams. And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned.  Five foot three isn't tall. She's not the girl I pictured at all. In those paint by number fantasies I've had,  So it took me by complete surprise. When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was looking for. She's more.  No it wasn't, at first sight, But the moment I looked twice. I saw the woman I was born to love.  Her laughter fills my soul, And when I hold her I don't wanna let go. When it comes to her I can't get enough.  So it took me by complete surprise. When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was looking for. She's more.  More than I dreamed of, More than any man deserves. I couldn't ask for more than a love like hers.  So it took me by complete surprise, When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was looking for. She's more.  (hehe... Gwen has green eyes.)   Was That My Life?  - Jo Dee Messina   Ooooh.  I don't want to be the one who's old before their time, And lose the wonder that I felt as a child. I can't run this race believing I might lose; There's still so much to see, and so much left to do. Yes, I'll fall before I fly, But no one can say I never tried.  Oh, we just get one ride around the sun, In this dream of time. It goes so fast that one day we look back, And we ask: was that my life?   I close my eyes and think how lucky I have been, To hold the ones I love and share my dreams with them. All those sunny days and all those starry skies: Good morning kisses and sweet goodnights. Oh, I can't tell them enough, Just how much that they are loved.  Oh, you just get one ride around the sun, In this dream of time. It goes so fast that one day we look back, And we ask: was that my life?   We just get one ride around the sun, In this dream of time. It goes so fast that one day we look back, And we ask: oh, was that my life? Ooh, was that my life rollin' on by? Oooh, rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on by. Was that my life? Ooooh, was that my life?

      This is something really insightful that a member of  urlLink Youthfire.com , named  urlLink Dave  posted in  urlLink this page :  “Love and relationships are truly one of the most paradoxical aspects of being human. For it is in love that we find the greatest of strengths and the deepest of sorrows. Love can seem to be so fleeting and unachievable yet it remains well within our reach if we only learn how to embrace it's power. To experience true love, we must be willing to open ourselves up and sacrifice part of our heart and part of our soul. We must be willing to give of ourselves freely, and we must be willing to suffer. It is only when we expose our inner selves to the white hot flame of rejection, that love can burn so brightly as to join to souls, melding the two into one, creating a bond that joins forever. It is from this bond that we draw strength eternal and power ever lasting. It is in this thing that we call love that we find the means to achieve greatness, both in ourselves and in our lives.” ~Author Unknown  ...love is a serious thing. Don't take it for granted. It's not a toy, or a game, or something you just pick up in the street. It's a gift straight from God, treasure it.

      Ok, here I am... posting... at school... again... There's been so much happening over the last two weeks and I cannot really sum it all up any way except by writing it all out (a task that I'm working on at home... still a few more days until a couple of massive posts that will cover that.  Several major points off the top of my head:  1. My small group (plus Steven and Sash.) went on an all-nighter two Fridays ago and TPed Ryan and Drew's (two youth leaders) houses. 2. I drove Wednesday and Thursday with Mr Weber (my Bible and Driver's Ed. teacher). 3. I attended my high school's graduation and recorded it for Gwen 4. I went to a really weird Grad. Party for my friend Christine 5. I went to Song on the Mountains (a really cool romance / comedy play by  urlLink Stages Theater ) with Gwen, Goody and Cam. 6. I went to Brady's Grad. Party and got really wet in a water fight (twas fun). 7. I met the people that I'm going to be working for this summer (more like having fun with). 8. School's out at 12:00 tomorrow!!!

      You know,  urlLink BlogThis!  seems almost too easy to use... I mean it's just sitting there waiting to be clicked, and If you're already logged in... What if some younger sibling or any other similarly incompetent person was to by chance click on it? You never really know what could end up on your site.  Hmmm... randomness

      Man, my dad just doesn't get it... We were talking on the way to work today (my room wasn't clean last night, so he won't let me drive myself anywhere) about his relationship with mom and whether or not he's being loving.  It's so frustrating trying to reason with him. As most of you know, He's from a Moslem background (having been born in Iran and all...) and the way his culture has taught him to think from birth is much different than most of us. We all use "linear reasoning" meaning that when we see a problem, we actively work our way logically to a solution. Example: If we are being kept awake at night by a faucet dripping, we all eventually have to come to the conclusion that the faucet is at fault. Once we have done this, we actively work toward a solution: getting up and turning the faucet all the way off. The way my dad thinks though, is something called “circular reasoning” where you see a problem and instead of working toward a solution you keep turning around and focusing on the problem. Example: Again we have ourselves almost asleep, but being kept awake by a dripping faucet. Instead of thinking about why the faucet’s dripping though, we start obsessing about the problem (the faucet’s dripping, the faucet’s dripping, the faucet’s dripping, THE FAUCET’S DRIPPING!!!). As you can see the former way of thinking is more logical, but once someone’s been ingrained with the latter, it’s very hard to convince them that they are going about it wrong, Imagine if you will that there is not one person, but two people within hearing of the faucet, one equipped with linear reasoning and one with circular, and that the one with linear (whom we will call person A) cannot reach the faucet.   Person B: The faucet’s dripping. Person A: I can hear the faucet’s dripping. Person B: The faucet’s dripping.  Person A: Yes, we’ve established that the faucet’s dripping, why don’t you just go take care of it? Person B: Because the faucet’s dripping. Person A: What? How does the faucet’s dripping keep you from fixing the faucet’s dripping? Person B: Because the faucet’s dripping. Person A: WHAT?? What’s wrong with you? Person B: Nothing. Person A: THEN GO FIX THE FAUCET!! Person B: But, the faucet’s dripping.  This is pretty much how I feel when talking to my dad. He listens to what you say, but he doesn’t  listen  to what you say. Actually, it’s more like he can’t comprehend what you’re saying.   Anyway, specifically we were talking about what he would do if she got kicked out of (or rather stopped attending because there’s no way she feels comfortable there, and what good is a church if it’s not a place of refuge?) the church that they are both going to. He said that there’s no way he would leave I really honed in on that the entire drive to work. He seems convinced that the husband is called to be a hedge of protection around the family only when everyone’s obeying him to the letter. (By hedge of protection, which is a biblical term, I mean guarding us all from people or things that might oppress us or bring us down – like the stupid people in my mom’s (now former) church. A small portion of our conversation went something like this:  Me: So you’re saying you would stay at Southwest Hills if mom left or was kicked out? Him: Yes Me: Why? Him: Why not? Me: Well, think about it this way: you’re always talking about unity and wanting to be one with you wife… well what do you think it’ll do to her, knowing that you still continue going to a church where everyone looks down on her? Him: That is my church. Me: Yes, but your church as a whole seems to be at odds with mom.  …silence… Me: What are husbands supposed to do for their wives? Him: Love them and provide for them and… Me: Whoa, wait a second; the first thing you said is love right? Him: yes Me: how are you displaying you love for her right now? Him: I love her. Me: That’s not what I asked, I asked how you’re displaying it. Him: What do you mean? Me: Well, you’re supposed to be a protection against things like this that are going on, but instead do you realize what you’ve become? - The very thing that God designed a husband to protect his wife against! Him: Well, she’s the one that’s leaving Me: What? And that somehow negates the husband’s responsibility to be a shield? You’re to love and protect you family, especially your wife, unconditionally: not just when you think she’s deserving of it. Him: But she has left me shield when she disobeyed me. Me: You just don’t get it do you? She can’t “leave”; it’s ALWAYS supposed to be there. Him: Not if she leaves it...  (This went on like this pretty much all the way to work.)  Maybe now you can kinda see the relation to the faucet example in his way of thinking.

      Ok, let’s talk girls. (LOL) First off, obviously is Gwen. I’m really confused as to my position right now regarding her – Steven, I told you that I was over her and I thought I was, but now I realize that I’m not. I still very much in love with her, but I’m praying that if it’s God’s will, that He help me let her go. Her position is “just a friend” but I’m having a hard time adjusting to the idea (yeah, and since we were never technically a couple, that really *ahem* makes sense, yeah...). Though, I only think that way when I think about her by myself; when I’m with her, I’m fine just being friends. It’s not like I’m depressed or down over it or anything, I’m just really confused with myself right now, that’s all I guess.   Second girl, Bwitty; to begin with, don’t get me wrong - I’m not attracted to her like ‘that’, but for some reason I just realized after talking to her today for the first time in... several months (and she lives three blocks below me, how stupid is that?) that I really care about her. I don’t get it, I can just see her hurting from a ton of stuff and I get almost... I want to say protective of her, but that’s not the right word. It’s like I want to just pull her away from all of it. (And the weirdest thing is, I don’t really know her that well.) By the way Bwitty, if you read this, please know that I’m praying for you.  Third girl, Laurie (and out of you three, you’re the only one that actually reads this... if I’m thinking right I should have talked about you first... hmm... and the fact that I just said that before posting it makes me question my sanity, but oh well) LOL ‘Ne way, it’s kinda the same way with you as it is with Bwitty, though I actually know some of the stuff in Bwitty’s life, and I really don’t know too much about you except from your blog and when we talk. Again, though, I find myself really caring about you (though not so much in a ‘protective’ sense). I guess it’s more that I can relate to your situation and feel for anyone going through it ‘cause I know what it’s like. Hey, I got your phone # btw, email me and tell me when a good time to call is. :)  Ok, the fact that I actually wrote that is starting to weird me out, so I’m gonna go and get some... sleep... yeah... sleep sounds real good right now...

      I'm going to take my camera to youth group tonight and take some random pictures with the intention of posting them later tonight.   I need to get working on that  urlLink lyrics / mp3 page  later. In about a week, I’m going to be completely revamping my computer network at home and hopefully setting up an apache web server to host my site locally. I may just put off working on anything until then, or I may not.... depends on whether I get bored I guess :)   Oh, I'm applying to join a youth newsletter that  urlLink Laurie's  starting. I may post my "trial" article when I finish it later today or tomorrow.

      On Thursday, I talked to Drew for a while regarding issues between the Lees and Rivas’. He advised me to stay neutral in the whole thing so that I could better benefit everyone. If I draw over to one side, what good am I doing?  On Friday, I got off work early before lunch, and drove Trung and Loren (coworkers) around town, from PCC Sylvania all the way over to Wilsonville, and back to several other places. We kept taking back roads at Trung’s direction and getting lost :). After several hours of this, I finally dropped them off at Tony’s house and went back to mine to get ready for the mini-concert at our church later. I dropped by Gwen’s work on the way over to church and finally saw her after she got back from the trip. She didn’t want to take a break, so she walked me out to my car, carrying my only purchased item, a 2-liter of Ginger Ale (lol).   I finally got to church slightly past 4:30 and helped with setup. The concert officially started at 6:00, but we bumped it back an hour total, to accommodate setting the sound system up more precisely. It was really fun - Freeborn, my friend Jo’s band played. We had ramps and rails for boarding and bmx, plus a bbq and some other stuff. Katie, Kat, Melissa and Adri came. I stayed after until past 11:40, tearing down and putting stuff away.  On Sat., I went to Goody’s house for David’s surprise B-day party. Later, Goody and I got a ride to the MAX station where we met Trung, Josh, Loren, Tony, Jason, and two other people and went to the Lloyd Center to see Pirates of the Caribbean. (That’s an AWESOME movie!!! Johnny Depp’s performance was perfect, and the movie as a whole couldn’t have been done better. If you haven’t seen it yet, see it!). We saw some rather interesting people every time we got on / off the MAX: one kid was just being an idiot, cussing at everyone he saw, including old ladies and stuff. Everyone on the car started talking about him in hushed tones when he got off. Another guy is a mime that I’ve seen down at Waterfront Park before – he paints his entire body, hair, face... clothes, silver and sits motionless for hours at a time. Then there were the two... dysfunctional women... who got into a fight on the tracks at the Lloyd Center Station and stopped a train. Then, they seemed content with hurling both insults and physical objects at each other from across the station until another train arrived, and one got on. Then, the other woman would occasionally get up and start screaming and beating at unseen people seemingly following her around. ...Interesting night.  Sunday morning, COUNTRY FEST 2003!!! (well, actually it wasn’t that good) basically Trung, Loren, Josh, Jason and I drove for 2 hours out to St. Helens in two cars and spent the day tanning under the sun, listening to mind-numbingly loud country music. We were stationed more than 800 feet from the stage, and the bass woofers still shook the ground... That’s a little too much power, methinks. Later, it only took us an hour and a half to get home because we took the roads that we had completely overlooked on the way there. I was depressed the entire day after I got home. Everyone was cranky and needed a nap or something (lol).  Monday morning, work... I was still really depressed until mid afternoon, when Trung and I washed my boss’s house for two hours (lol). For some reason, it was then that I regained my vitality and joyful spirit and all. Later that evening, my parents attended a church-wide meeting at their church that would be the springboard for the church to vote whether of not to kick my mom out (In my very wise uncle’s words: “I was at the stupid meeting last night. Wished I could have been somewhere else, but I’m glad I was there to support your mom. Those people there are... CRAZY, for lack of a more demeaning term.”)  Today, I got to work late since my room wasn’t clean, and my parent’s new punishment to obsess with is not letting me drive anywhere. They are going to start using that as recklessly as they confiscated my Xbox back in Feb. They kept adding on and on time till I could have it back, until as of now, I am entitled to have it back sometime next Spring (though I just decided to go and take it out of their room two weeks ago, and either they haven’t noticed it yet, or they’re trying to act like they don’t care.  My mom and I went out to lunch today (she picked me up from work), and we had a long talk about every topic ranging from Gwen, to work, to school next year, to the meeting last night at her church. I love my mom; she’s so easy to talk to. :)  Today, I went up to Gwen’s house at about 8:15pm and didn’t get back down until almost 10:20. While I was up there she made some random comment about how long my hair was, and within ten minutes she was giving me a haircut (lol). I need to take a picture of myself now, I’m all buzzed. My foot's sore from kicking her punching bag for like, 20 minutes.   Tomorrow, I’m letting Trung borrow my Xbox and I’m borrowing his PS2 for ...a week I think.  Well, goodnight everyone, and may God watch over your sleep.

      Hey everyone, sup? I dunno what was wrong with me the last couple days... I was so unfailingly joyful for a couple weeks then I sunk into a huge depression. But now, through my own realization that God is in control of my life, coupled with the support of friends, I'm fine again.   This is a poem that  urlLink Laurie  wrote and emailed to me yesterday after reading my Mon Jul 21, 11:40:00 AM post. Thanks, Laurie, that meant alot to me:   I bled for you    Everything is fading away Everything but my pain There's nothing left in me I think I'm going insane  Truth or lie I feel like I'm falling away I'd rather die Than feel this way  Where is the love you promised Where is the peace you share Where is the golden rainbow Or do you even care?  My eyes are hollow holes I'm drowning in my hurt I reach out, reach up I'm falling to the dirt  There's a cavity inside me I'm falling down into the pit It has no bottom, I'm forever falling Something doused the candle that was lit  I'm falling, falling Falling away from you Something's pulling me down Holding onto me like glue  Tears keep falling down my face I am powerless to stop them This is my only release Until I hit rock bottom  I want to die Why am I alive The question echoes through me Cutting through me like a knife  I look at my heart Bloody, stained, broken Then my heart echoes With words softly spoken  "Did you know I bled for you?" The thought pierces my soul My God, my God, have you forsaken me? "No, my heart is full."  "I bled too, my son I know how you feel" You couldn't! I yell "But I have, it is the seal."  "My heart bleeds even now At your pain that seems so endless" Tears flow faster down my cheeks, At the memories of bliss  "Cry my son, Cry for the love Cry for the loss Cry for the blood."    © Laurie, 2003

      I just wrote this ten minutes ago.   The End    My life, my comfort, my shell of hope, Creaked and groaned with every passing day But now it’s all finally come crashing down God help me,  I never thought it would end this way.  Alone in the darkness The dawn brings not hope, But despair and distress Challenge me to cope.  I’m left in the ruins  Of all I can see Fathomless grief  Consuming me.  No one to run to,  Nowhere to hide, Nothing to live for,  No path by which to bide.  The fire which once Gave light to my heart Burns down to nothing; Shadow, Light depart.  As I wander this wasteland Over and over, Again and again, Memories of every kind Flood past me,  Thoughts of what could have been  …Of what could have been.

        Drive - Incubus   Sometimes, I feel the fear of  Uncertainty stinging clear. And I can’t help but ask myself How much I’ll let the fear  Take the wheel and steer.  It’s driven me before, and it seems to Have a vague, haunting mass appeal. But lately I am beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel.  Whatever tomorrow brings, I’ll be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah. Whatever tomorrow brings, I’ll be there, I’ll be there…  So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of The hive Will I choose water over wine and hold my own And drive?  It’s driven me before and it seems to be the way That everyone else gets around. But lately I’m beginning to find that When I drive myself My light is found.  Whatever tomorrow brings, I’ll be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah. Whatever tomorrow brings, I’ll be there, I’ll be there…  (Would you kill the Queen to crush the hive?)  Would you choose Water over wine… Hold the wheel And drive?  Whatever tomorrow brings, I’ll be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah. Whatever tomorrow brings, I’ll be there, I’ll be there…   That's all I can think of tonight folks... I'm way too burned out... I want to crawl into a dark hole and sleep for a week. Or maybe die, that sounds better. Hmm... scratch that... Dying in and of itself seems rather pointless, but the property of being dead... Oh God I wish I could just be gone from here.

      Oh man, I could listen to this song for an eternity... I love it, it's so beautiful.    Nina Gordon - Tonight and the rest of my life   Down to the earth I fell with dripping wings Heavy things won’t fly And the sky might catch on fire And burn the axis of the world that’s why I prefer a sunless sky To the glittering and stinging in my eyes  And I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life  Gleaming in the dark sea I’m as light as air floating there breathlessly When the dream dissolves I open up my eyes I realize that Everything is shoreless sea A weightlessness is passing over me  And I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life Tonight and the rest of my life And I  Everything is waves and stars The universe is resting in my arms  I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life And I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life Tonight and the rest of my life   I'm going to sleep to this song tonight. :)

      My current favorite song:    JoDee Messina - I Wish   It's not easy saying this to you It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do But boy before you go I want you to know  I wish you strength When times are hard Oh I wish with all my heart you find what  you're looking for I wish you joy I wish you peace And that every star you see's within your reach And I wish you still loved me  I wish that things were different you know that But still I'm happy for the time we had You mean the world to me Baby please believe  I wish you strength When times are hard Oh I wish with all my heart you find what  you're looking for I wish you joy I wish you peace And that every star you see's within your reach And I wish you still loved me  Losing you is tearing me apart But a part of me will be with you no matter where you are  I wish you strength When times are hard Oh I wish with all my heart you find what  you're looking for I wish you joy I wish you peace And that every star you see's within your reach And I wish you still loved me  Oh, I wish you still loved me   Oh, btw, I got a car on Sunday!! I don't know why I didn't post about that before now... maybe I've been slightly preoccupied… (lol)

      This post kinda incorporates a response to  urlLink Kevin’s  comment about my last post, in it.    that's too bad Armaan. at least you get to be friends. I have a friend that this (very similar) thing happened to recently. He was/is crushed. It's a bad thing that happens between people. I urge you to keep praying about it if you still have feelings for her. This may be God's way of preparing her for a good relationship with you? Who among us knows the mind of God? Anyway, my point is she can still change her mind in the future. ~Kevin    The sad thing is, I was planning to tell her everything about how I feel and how much she means to me the next time I talked to her, but now I’m glad I didn’t. I can’t imagine how hard it would have been for her to tell me that if I had started out by telling her how I felt about her. She has a hard enough time as it is just telling me stuff that could potentially hurt me to begin with. (She’s such a sweet girl... she really doesn’t want to hurt me, but at the same time, she doesn’t want to lead me on. I really respect her for that.)  Anyway, yeah, I really don’t want to loose her as a friend. I guess that I would venture to say that keeping a good friendship with her is more important than any type of romantic relationship, if it has the possibility of leaving us farther apart than when we started. Plus, the only way I’ll be happy with the situation is if she’s happy: We could be dating steadily, but if she’s not happy, I’m not happy. Same goes with another guy: If she’s in a relationship with someone else, and isn’t happy, I’m not going to be happy, but if she is, then I most likely will be (or at least will try to be).  As far as where this relationship is going... Your guess is as good as mine (lol). I think I’ll just have to sit back and trust God on that one. (Hey, what am I saying? I have to trust him for the entire thing.) Through all this though, my love for her is not even flickering... I pray that if it’s not God’s will that we never get back together, that He would take my love for her from me, but if we ever will, I pray that I never get involved with another girl between now and then... I want to be there for her if she’s ever in a time of need.  Oh, btw, I’m meeting Drew tomorrow to talk and pray about the... issue surrounding two families that I love, and want to have good relations restored between.

      Gwen called! (lol - ok... enough) She's back and had a great time. We talked for around an hour and ten minutes starting at 12:20 (late... yeah, but that is our custom).   You know, I was secretly afraid this was going to happen the entire time, but I guess I pretty well convinced myself that it wasn't, because if I'd thought about it for long enough, I would have been insanely depressed... and now that it actually has happened... exactly as I feared it would but never thought it would, I think I can handle it.  Well, maybe...  Hmm...  Only time will tell...   What on earth am I talking about you ask? Well, in the course of our conversation tonight (this morning - lol) Gwen told me that she had something that she wanted to talk to me about (Im thinking *oh no, here it comes*). She said she had been doing a lot of thinking about it over the three weeks she was away, and had decided that it would probably be better if we just remained friends... never to become anything greater. She went on to say that (*yup, I guessed it alright*) she had found someone that she was more interested in while on the trip. (Story of my life.) Immediately afterward though, she added that she wanted to continue being friends, and I heartily agreed.  After that our normal conversation resumed and we talked for another 45 minutes until her mom made us (well, me since she knows I have work early in the morning, and Gwen doesn't) get off.  o.O I just remembered that email I sent, that I know for certain she hasn't read yet... Hmmm... I wonder what effect that'll have...  Well, good night and happy landings and don't forget to check out the newest of my friend's blogs...  urlLink Andrew's

        the Ataris - In This Diary   Here in this diary, I write you visions of my summer. It was the best I ever had. There were choruses and sing-alongs, and not a spoken feeling. I'm knowing that right now is all that matters. All the nights we stayed up talking and listening to 80's songs; quoting lines from all those movies that we love. It still brings a smile to my face. I guess when it comes down to it...  Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up: These are the best days of our lives. The only thing that matters is just following your heart and eventually you'll finally get it right.  Breaking into hotel swimming pools, and wreaking havoc on our world. Hanging out at truck stops just to pass the time. The black top's singing me to sleep. Lighting fireworks in parking lots, illuminate the blackest nights. Cherry cokes under this moonlight summer sky. 2015 Riverside, it's time to say, "goodbye." Get on the bus, it's time to go.  Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up: These are the best days of our lives. The only thing that matters is just following your heart, and eventually you'll finally get it right.

      Cameran wanted me to post this email, so I'm doing so;  Subject: Or you can put this on my blog   Hey Armaan, I have been thinking about all that has been going on non-stop.  and how tired I'm.   I have been weighing out everything, and what is good for me.  I also have been talking to my Mom about it all.  And here is my opinion, because I'm done with all this crap.  ---------------------------------------------------- I know if Brady really wanted to he could turn around. Brady Can't be helped, I wanted to help him, because he is a great guy.  the reason he can't be helped is because he won't help himself. why you ask? because He loves attention, that's why he continues to be in areas or subjects having to do with the rivas family or anything that gives attention to him.  And I'm sure that's not the only problem. ---------------------------------------------------- I'm not saying I'm perfect we all have problems,insecurities, and issues, I guess just one of mine is low tolerance.    My only friends that have helped me grow mentally are you armaan and andrew motimer.  ---------------------------------------------------- And the Rivas family in my opinion, not having to do with Brady or beth...just my own experience, are the type of people I hope to never be like.    They have everything wrong about me, even how they think they know me, If they really knew me they would hate me like they hate Brady, I'm sure. I'm also "VERY" tired of being bossed around by people who think they are better in every way, when they really aren't, because no man is above another we are all equally guilty.  and when you don't do as they say some tend to get physical or argue aloud. And I don't want to be around that anymore. I really have nothing good to say about the Rivas family,  and just one of the reasons I can't be a friend to the Rivas family is because in there minds they are perfect, and there is no helping the perfect. so I'm done. ---------------------------------------------------- And going to Drew could help you, but most likely won't, and you know what? I hope I'm completely wrong about every single thing I have said so far and that I will say.     ----------------------------------------------------   I'm cutting myself off from this whole mess. I have a new screen name. I will no longer be answering the phone for these numbers/people and not because I hate the people I just hate the way, and well the retardedness at times.      [at this point he lists all phone numbers associated with the Lee and Rivas families]     Family's: Rivas Lee         And I have blocked certain e-mail addresses. I wonder if this is what you might call a mental break down of some kind. O and tell the rivas family not to bother coming to my house, because like I have said I'm done. ---------------------------------------------------- Here is some advise to the rivas family in the matter of Brady and ect:    This is love: To love people as we find them, and if they have weaknesses, to accept them with a heart filled with love.   "Love never fails." 1 Cor. 13:8   A friend is someone that will except you the way he or she found you, And if she or he has weaknesses, to accept him or her with a heart filled with love and to help them no matter the matter because that is just one of the many things friend are for.   1 Corinthians 13:1-13  I may speak in the tongues of men, even angels; but if I lack love, I have become merely blaring brass or a cymbal clanging.  I may have the gift of prophecy, I may fathom all mysteries, know all things, have all faith-enough to move mountains; but if I lack love, I am nothing.  I may give away everything that I own, I may even hand over my body to be burned; but if I lack love, I gain nothing.  Love is patient and kind, not jealous, not boastful, not proud, rude or selfish, not easily angered, and it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not gloat over other peoples sins  But takes its delight in the truth. Love always bears up, always trusts, always hopes, always endures.  Love never ends; but prophecies will pass, tongues will cease, knowledge will pass. For our knowledge is partial, and our prophecy partial; but when the perfect comes, he partial will pass.  When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, argued like a child; now that I have become a man, I have finished with childish ways.   For now we see obscurely in a mirror, but then it will be face to face. Now I know partly; then I will know fully, just as God has fully known me.  But for now, three things last- Trust, Hope, Love; And the greatest of these is Love.   -----------------------------------------------------    Our "group"  (circle of friendship)  is a place of warmth and caring  (but for me its been cold because of serious competition in the area of play or "games", and caring which is fake if acted out)  Where people come together  (now there is a rift in-between the Lee family and the Rivas family which complicates and complicates over and over.)  for listening and sharing. ( which can be hard at times because of the rift but other wise is easy for me and you) A place of kindness and trust. ( it used to be, and if there still is its decaying) of tears and laughter too; ( tears of joy? I don't think so at the moment, laughter seems a bit scares but I could be wrong.)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Armaan, I know I suck as a friend too. I'm very sorry about everything. if you could you might want to put this on your blog. but you might wanna edit out the phone #. I'm sure I'll talk to you soon, but I will see you later dude.   Sincerely,  Cameran Renata Heckenlaible      p.s. I'm done  .....Hiding in my hole, like andrew.

      Ok, yesterday morning I got up at 5:15 (not 4:00 like I’d planned) and ran to finish packing before 6:00 when Laurie would get to my house... I’m glad I did rush since, even with her dad getting lost for 15 minutes, (lol) I was still a little late getting out to the car.   Once I finally got out, my mom drove us an hour-an-a-half down to OSU (Oregon State) in Corvallis. We were they that day and today for the Mid-Summer Conference - part of our apprenticeships through ASE (Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering), and division of Saturday Academy. We got down there, signed in, ate a continental breakfast and hung out for a while, all before the orientation session at 9 o’clock. After that, all 150 of us apprentices there split up into groups of about 15 and played some really random get-to-know-you games together for a while. Then, we had the first of several lectures that day (we picked the ones we wanted to attend beforehand), ate lunch, and had a couple more lectures and a hands-on workshop. Dinner was fun - the café that we ate in was sweet.   After dinner, we split up into 20 groups at the MU Quad and set about “defying gravity” by building 2 meter tall towers out of nothing but newspaper, a tiny bit of tape and a predetermined random object. The tower had to support itself in the wind, suspending a marble from it, for a minimum of ten seconds. Awards were given to the two teams who built the most complex tower, and the cheapest tower. My group won the first title and Laurie’s won the second (lol)  Later that night, my little group of friends (Laurie, and some random people we had just met from Lakeview – Wade and Kate, and other people) went swimming. The pools at OSU are sweet. :)  They consisted of a huge diving pool, Olympic-size relay pool and a mammoth hot tub. Twas quite fun. After I got out, I spent like ten minutes in a frikin’ hot sauna drying off. As we were walking back, Wade and some random girl decided to run through some random sprinklers for a while, and while they were doing so, others informed me about some really funny senior pranks they pull at their school. (This was almost 9:45 at night, and it had finally cooled down from 85 to around 75.)   Once I got back to the dorm, I changed and walked back down to the MU (the under-story of which is a pool hall / bowling alley / mini theater place. I left shortly thereafter, because of the heat. (I met Laurie walking back from it as I walked to it and she warned me that it was hot in there, but did I listen? ... no – lol) Later, close to 10:45 or 11:00 I grabbed a couple pop tarts and watched part of Monty Python and the Holy Grail before getting back up to my room. My roommates and I didn’t get to sleep for what must have been a couple hours, partly because of the heat, and partly because of random logic and word problems we kept giving each other... like: what’s the only word in the English language who’s pronunciation and meaning are both changed by capitalizing the first letter? polish >> Polish (interesting, huh?).  ‘Ne way, I got up this morning around 7:00 instead of 6:00 and decided to forgo a shower for the day. I packed all my luggage and turned in my room key (but not my food card, which I needed for dinner the night before and breakfast later that morning). I had cereal for breakfast...yum.   Right after breakfast, we took group pictures on the steps of the MU (We were commenting that we all felt like a combination of a junior MENSA, FFA and some major communist party, 150 of us intellectual teenagers, walking down the streets of a major college, all wearing the same light blue shirt. We took several pictures, and I realized later that photographer in front of us didn’t have the only camera trained on us: There’s a live webcam on the building the Quad from us that was recording a time-lapse video that I dled, and am working on extracting an image from. Once I do so, I’ll post it.   The next lecture was the only one Laurie and I had in common. Sooo... um... *how to say?* boring. The next one for me was worse, actually, but the last hands-on one was SO fun. It was so random; was on automatic data storage and collection. At one point, one of the students needed a hand-held barcode scanner, across the room, so an instructor picked one up and threw it to him. I though that was strange and asked him, “Umm... how much are those worth?” He replied calmly “Oh, about 55 hundred a piece”. Later, when I asked him why he was just throwing 5 grand pieces of equipment around haphazardly, he responded by picking up another one, and throwing across the room. Turns out the scanners are the best on the market... insured for up to a 12 foot drop onto concrete (lol).  We had lunch on the Quad (like the yesterday) and I called Bwitty, and actually got a hold of her for the first time in months! (An accomplishment, I feel.) Laurie ended up talking to her for like, twenty times longer than I did.   Anyway, later there was a final meeting, during which my mom showed up and told me to step outside quickly and call my dad since he was putting a down payment on what was going to be my new car. *yay* Later, we drove back home, Laurie got picked up at my house, and I drove the van for the first time, by myself, to the theater to see LXG (League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).  Man, I spent so much time with Laurie over the last two days. Every break, every meal, we were together, talking or something. She’s a cool girl and I’d never really gotten to know her that well. Altogether, the Conference was an awesome time.

      Today was fun. Two things of interest happened:  (In order of priority) 1. Gwen called again!  2. I got my driver’s license!  I got up late, and found the address for the DMV on the way there... (lol), waited in lines for a while and finally got assigned an examiner. You know how they always tell you not to engage in small talk with the examiner while taking the test... it’ll only distract you? Apparently “they” weren’t thinking of me and my instructor. We were chatting the entire time... Topics ranged from to the weather, our jobs, buildings being demolished on the side of the road, and even random rodents running across the road at odd times (in the middle of a city...¿). LOL. After that I went back inside, waited in more lines and finally took the test on the computer, got my picture taken and received my license.   I drove back home, got stuff for work and headed over to work, arriving at 11:15 (I usually get there at 8:00). I worked for an hour, talked on the phone with Gwen’s mom for another hour while programming PIC chips and starting my lunch break (lol), took another half hour for the rest of my lunch break, and got back to work. Stuff was going smoothly until a technical rescue vehicle, followed by an ambulance pulled into view. (As my other posts say, it turned out that my boss’s wife has a major insulin reaction. He blood sugar level was 239ish around lunch, and dropped to 29 in three hours. Anyway, they gave her an IV and she was fully conscious within a few minutes.  I got off work at 5:00, went home, chatted on IRC chat.christianlinks.com #youthfire for an hour or so, ate dinner, and headed over to Mid-Week. (I was going to drive over to Cam’s house, but I thought Steven might need a ride back from Mid-Week, so I had my dad take me there and back – I can’t drive anyone under 20, outside of my family for 6 months, with Oregon driving rules). The funny thing is, Steven and I didn’t even end up seeing each other and didn’t know the other was even there until we talked about it later on the same chat room listed above.  Then, at 9:22, Gwen called! (lol) I was beginning to suspect I’d have to wait for her to get back to talk to her next, but no, she was sweet and called again :)  My dad and I ate at Carl’s Jr., and he told me about a walk he’d had with my mom earlier. That’s cool – ‘twas the first time they’ve done that in... a long while.  Oh, btw, I’m gonna have to leave youth group really early tomorrow night, since I have to get up at 4 the nest morning. (Lori’s coming over at 6, and we need to be checked into the ASE Mid-Summer Conference by 8:30 in Corvallis). My mom’s prolly going to end up spending the night down there, since it’s easier to do that than to some back up then go back down and back up again on Sat.   Well, see yah all on the flipside (and I fear for  urlLink Ddee  and her platinum hair.... *shudders* - lol)

      o.O Uh oh, an ambulance just drove up... I'd better go check and see what's going on...  ***half-an-hour later***  Ok, it was just my boss's wife having an insulen reaction ("just"... yeah i know). She doesn't remember calling 911. Strange...

      ok, I emailed Gwen last night, but forgot to post the email before I got off, so here you go:    Subject: Thinking about you...  Hey Gwen, how’re you doing? I know that you’ll not be reading this until after you get back (possibly way after, knowing your email checking habits - lol) but I’ll write it like I am writing to you right now, not you a week from now.   ...If you understood that, I’ll be happy ‘cause I barely do reading through it again, tired as I am.   Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I miss you and I’m praying for you. A couple days after I got that letter asking for prayer for the trip, I tacked it up on my wall to remind me to do just that. Initially, it helped a lot, I’d see it as I was going to bed, and pray for you for a while every night. Even several weeks before you left, it got so ingrained in my mind, that I was praying for the trip more than a couple times a day. (In fact, I don’t know really why I still have the letter up… maybe just sentimental reasons). Now, you’re one of the biggest things on my mind, day by day. I almost laughed when you asked me to be praying for everyone’s health to stay strong, in spite of lack of sleep, when you called last Tuesday. That was one of the major things God had pressed upon my heart since the day I found out you were going on the trip. Oh, and it’s not just me… several of my friends around the world are praying for the trip (and specifically you) too. They know nothing really about you other than you’re a friend of mine that’s going on a mission trip for around three weeks, and that I knew that you’d be appreciative if they were praying for it and for you.   On a slightly more personal note: I really do miss you. I’m gonna be so happy when I see your pretty face again, or even hear your voice. :)  (Do me a favor: don’t go somewhere far away for college right after you graduate. That’s really going to get to me, having to spend my senior year not really seeing you at all. Hmm… I guess I’ll just have to trust God about that one. Oh, by the way, speaking of God, I have to praise Him: all this week, more and more stuff has been happening to my family, but through it all, I’ve been amazingly happy. I just can’t get over this joyful spirit, and I thank the Lord for it (and I thank you for caring enough to tell me out right to “stay happy” last time we talked).    Oh well, my contacts are starting to annoy my eyes and I have to get up ½ an hour early tomorrow for work, so I’d better wrap this up and send it.   With love, in Christ,   ~Armaan

      Ok, this post is a reply to Steven's latest post on  urlLink his blog . In fact, I would be writing this in his comments section, but it's just way too long.  The following is part of his 7/8/2003 01:51:36 PM post:    Why the heck did God give me the life he did? Why couldn't I have the life of so many other people... they are happy. Why was I given this life to live? I'm supposed to learn from it? I'd rather not; I'd rather that I had a life like other people. Mine is freaking messed up.    Yeah, I kinda know how you're feeling right now (kinda cause my situation at home is slightly different from yours... but not by much). I've been going through this whole emotional Ferris wheel too. One minute, things will be fine with my dad, then the next it's a hurricane. I think so often, "God, why oh why did I even have to be born to live this life? Why did you pick me? Is there something I'm supposed to get out of it; is there something you're preparing me for? I don't want to go through this to become closer to You, I want to be close NOW, Lord... Why couldn't you have picked someone else to live through this hell, someone better suited for it? I just want to get out... want to get out.... want. to. get. out.  Steven, like you, right now I can't really offer many answers, only more questions. But one thing I do know (though I think many times that I'm mistaken, but always realize I was right after all, after a time): No matter how hard it is to see it now (and in some cases, even impossible), God does have a plan for our lives; He loves us and knows what's best for us. Though oh, so many times I wish God would just take me from this earth, or better yet, cause me to never have been born. All this having been said, I'm forced to wonder why he picked me (why he picked us). If God had not been with us all this time, helping us through it, I truly believe we would have cracked far before now.   Whatever... if I say anything else, it'll just be rambling on and on about what I just said, so I'll leave it at that.

      I just got back from my Goody, David and Sara's house, where we had a short HALO LAN party. In attendance were Goody, David, Cam, Caleb, Dallas, Ryan, Ben, Sara and me. I brought a large tv and my XBOX.  We (Goody, David, Cam and me) creamed everyone else royally. 'Twas fun. :)  Earlier this morning, I went to my orthodontist to get a permanent retainer re-bonded. Took like, 5 minutes, but I missed the first hour-and-a-half of work for it. Oh well, I'll just come in a half-hour early, tomorrow through Thursday.  Steven and I were going to go to a youth counseling thing tomorrow night called Teens Helping Teens, but my mom was at the facility today and found out that they had a recent schedule change - same time, but Mondays, not Tuesdays. I hope we’ll both be able to make it to it now that it’s a different day.  Ok, I just can’t post this without mentioning Gwen. (lol) I’m really starting to miss her now, and it’s only been like 10 days. I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like if she goes far off someplace to college for a year while I’m still a senior in high school. Hmm… thinking about that just depresses me, so instead I’ll think about seeing her again when she gets back. I might write her an email or two for her to read when she gets back, but I know she never checks her email... so it might be pointless. Nah, I'll do it anyway.  Listening to  John Tesh -  Goodnight Moon .   Close your eyes and drift away... Touch the stars in the sky on the way...   (the singer sings the rest so softly that it's hard to pick out some of her words, so I'll juss leave it at that.  Goodnight world. Sleep well. (Be safe, those of you north of the border... come home soon.)

      People that need prayer:  1. Gwen (man, I miss her) > For her mission trip, that everything will continue to go well, that people will continue to function with lack of sleep and that they would all be protected from any diseases that might be going around (and bugs and stuff). 2. My mom > She's been under constant emotional attack lately, not only from my dad and sister, but also from the majority of her church, who have sided with my dad. 2. My sister > She's kinda heading down the wrong path, siding with my dad in all the new issues. She's becoming harder and harder to live with and I want that to change. 3. Bwitty > She's going through a tough time in her life right now. I don't really know any details, if you read  urlLink her blog , you'll be about as informed as I. 4. Josiah, Jesh and Jalon's family. > Apparently they just lost a grandpa. 5. People like me, Steven and Laurie (a friend from  urlLink YouthFire.com  - check out  urlLink her blog ), who live in situations involving an abusive, or at least, over domineering parent.  Goodnight fellow firework-toting patriots and others, alike. Go with God.

      [Music Mood]: A Few Questions - Clay Walker  We got the organ today :) It's tight. My dad wants to keep it in the garage untill we get it cleaned up, but then I hope to move it to the main area in the basement. (There's a slight possibility that it won't fit into the basement door, so we may have to put it on the main floor.) :D  btw, I posted a new song to my blog last post, but forgot to post the lyics *gasp* Soooo, here they are:   Lifehouse - Hanging by a Moment   Desperate for changing Starving for truth Closer where I started Chasing after you  I'm falling even more in love with you Letting go of all I've held onto I'm standing here until you make me move I'm hanging by a moment here with you  Forgetting all I'm lacking Completely and complete I'll take your invitation You take all of me  Now, I'm falling even more in love with you Letting go of all I've held onto I'm standing here until you make me move I'm hanging by a moment here with you  I'm living for the only thing I know I'm running and not quite sure where to go I don't know what I'm diving into Just hanging by a moment here with you  There's nothing left to lose Nothing left to fly There is nothing in the world that can change my mind There is nothing else There is nothing else  Desperate for changing Starving for truth Closer where I started Chasing after you  I'm falling even more in love with you Letting go of all I've held onto I'm standing here until you make me move I'm hanging by a moment here with you  I'm living for the only thing I know I'm running and not quite sure where to go I don't know what I'm diving into Just hanging by a moment here with you  Just hanging by a moment Hanging by a moment Hanging by a moment Hanging by a moment here with you

      [Music Mood]: Lifehouse – Hanging by a Moment  Gwen called again today! :) I was so happy so hear her voice again (lol).   I'm constructing some massive fireworks (some for the 4th, some for... other purposes). We’re prolly going to the Jesh’s house on the fourth and I might light some off there.   Tomorrow we’re getting an electric organ. :) For free… :)  Thursday night, Adrie, Melissa, Rachael and Josh are all coming to my youth group for a welcome home thingy for the newly-arrived-back Mexico team. Should be fun.

      My new fav. country song:    Lonestar -  My Front Porch Looking In   Oh yeah Yeah oh yeah  The only ground I ever owned was sticking to my shoes Now I look at my front porch and this panoramic view I can sit and watch the fields fill up With rays of glowing sun Or watch the moon lay on the fences Like that's where it was hung My blessings are in front of me It's not about the land I'll never beat the view From my front porch looking in  There's a carrot top who can barely walk With a sippy cup of milk A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong 'Cause she likes to dress herself And the most beautiful girl holding both of them And the view I love the most Is my front porch looking in, yeah  I've traveled here and everywhere Following my job I've seen the paintings from the air Brushed by the hand of God The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea But I can't wait to get back home To the one he made for me It's anywhere I'll ever go and everywhere I've been Nothing takes my breath away Like my front porch looking in  There's a carrot top who can barely walk With a sippy cup of milk A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong 'Cause she likes to dress herself And the most beautiful girl holding both of them Yeah the view I love the most Is my front porch looking in  I see what beautiful is about When I'm looking in  Not when I'm looking out  There's a carrot top who can barely walk With a sippy cup of milk A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong 'Cause she likes to dress herself And the most beautiful girl holding both of them Yeah the view I love the most  Oh, the view I love the most Is my front porch looking in Yeah Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk (From my front porch looking in) A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong, yeah And the most beautiful girl (Beautiful girl From my front porch looking in) Holding both of them Oh, yeah

      Ok, as of several minutes ago, I have officially not talked to / seen Gwen for a week. Is that a good or bad thing?

Yeah, 'ne way goodnight people, God bless, and have a great last week of summer.  TTFN (lol@Becky B.)  I'll miss ya all~

      Anyway, recap: my dad was being an idiot and harrassing my mom for a while on the 1st floor, but i had no idea since I was up here in my room (3rd floor), online. My grandma called me and told me that she was on another phone with my mom, who was on another phone with the police. I had my sister (the younger one) lock herself in her room since I didn't know really what was going on, or how serious it was, and went downstairs to the room my mom was currently in. She was visibly shaken and I could tell my dad had really scared her. We waited a few minutes for the police to arrive and my dad, naturally came down and accosted the door of the room we were in for a bit before going up to the front door and answering it. Once we heard the front door open, my mom was fine with going up, so we did and then I went back up to my room for a bit while the police talked to my parents alone and kinda calmed the situation down. Later, my dad wanted to talk to me about why he had walked out on my presentation yesterday, but only succeded in making me all the more angry with him. He can be such a jerk when he wants to be... And we're all going to have to spend the next week with him up in Canada... joy...  Anyway, situation's passed, standby for more outbreaks of rage...

      OMG.... Holy crap!!! I just posted this to Laurie's blog and didn't even notice it for like, two hours!!  ... Sorry for the confusion if anyone saw that ...  btw, this was at about 9:00 here:  Hey, can everyone be praying for my family? We're in the middle of something kinda big right now involving my dad and we've got police over.  Thanks,  ~Armaan

           find out more at  urlLink jimmyeat.meetup.com    That's an awesome idea. :) I'm actually considering going to that.  Ddee, Andrew, Cam, Steven... wanna come with? (lol) I really don't have any idea if i'm even doing anything that day yet or not. ;)  This is an amazing J.E.W. song: it's written to Jimmy's girlfriend who died in a tragic car accident way before J.E.W. ever became a band. (At least that's the more popular of the two stories of how the song same to be, and it makes sense.)    Jimmy Eat World - Hear You Me     There's no one in town I know. You gave us some place to go. I never said thank you for that. I thought I might have one more chance. What would you think of me now... So lucky, So strong, So proud? I never said thank you for that, Now I'll never have a chance.  May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleepless go. May angels lead yo in.  So what would you think of me now... So lucky, So strong, So proud? I never said thank you for that. Now I'll never have a chance.  May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleeplss go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in.  And if you were with me tonight. I'd sing to you just one more time. A song for a heart so big, God couldn't let it live.  May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in.    One of the many thing that's awesome about this band is their dedication to their fans and to their music, not to the money - This is an actual Q&A I got from  urlLink http://www.jimmyeatworld.net/history/faq.html , a division of the official site.   Q.  How does the band feel about mp3s / bootlegs / napster / ebay / file sharing?   A.  I can't give an actual quote from the band, but I will tell you this. The band gave away all their songs for free on their website before Self-Titled (Bleed American) was even released (and they are still there!) . The band seems to not have a problem with sites that offer live mp3s to fans for free. On the other hand, the band said they hate when people sell their stuff on ebay. So I guess you could say that the band is cool if you are trading stuff between music fans, but they do not want you selling anything. Hopefully people can be trusted to purchase the CDs that contain the songs they download, if they are available.   Goodnight my beloveds, may God watch over your sleep, and when you're awake, may God direct your life.

      Ok, important things first: (lol) I had a great conversation with Gwen on Sunday night. I had called her house a couple times before 10:00 or so, but it was busy so I got online and she got on around 11:30. I asked if she would mind calling me when she got off, and she did later. We talked for a total of almost an hour (she called twice) and in that time I basically explained to her how I'd been feeling all this time and everything (mainly that I am in love with her) and that seemed to take her by shock. As far as calling her, she doesn't want me to stop, but maybe do it slightly less frequently. Oh, btw, I did inform her that I was perfectly content with being 'just friends' and she seemed relieved by that. I want her to be happy, and she is, so I am too. :)  The same night my friend Danie (short for Danielle, not Daniel) introduced me to a couple of her friends named Becky and Mandy. (... well more like they started talking under the false pretence of being her - lol). That Becky’s the one that confused SS’s Becky with her comment on the message board (lol).  I'm under some level of stress concerning a huge presentation I have to have to give on Sat. for my apprenticeship. Please be parying that I'll get everything done well and on time. Oh, btw, I very much doubt that I'll be online much, much less blog between now and then. And... I'm gonna be gone all of next week, so don't expect to see me online for a while. Ddee, I will be back before the 30th, but most likely I'm already attending a key signing party at Mikminamen's on the waterfront. Linus Torvald (however you spell his last name) might be there! I'm excited. :) :)

      Ok, here’s the post about Sat. that I told people, on Sat. that I’d be posting, but procrastinated … as is my nature. (lol)  I woke up at 10:15 from a phone call from Andrew who had just woken up too. (We were both planning on getting up somewhere in the area of 9, and we did, but we both went back to sleep again - LOL). I got ready as quickly as possible, but right as I was heading out the door, I was stopped by my dad who declared that I wasn’t going anywhere until I cleaned my room, vacuumed the house and washed the dishes. I weaseled my way out of that, but it still seemed to set me back about half an hour more… Andrew just eventually met me at a McDonalds by his house. We at brunch there and headed off to the mall (illegally, yes… in Oregon you have to have your license for 6 months before you can even drive one person under 20, outside of your family. – dumb law, I think, but I guess there are enough stupid kids my age here to warrant passing more laws to restrict them.)    urlLink   Andrew at McDonalds.    Once we got to the mall, we met up with Ddee and Kristy and headed over to the bus stop. Little did we know that would be the start of the first many, many loooooong waits at bus stops all day… (but it’s all good, that’s when we would talk the most – waiting for busses)    urlLink   Ddee and Kristy waiting for us at the mall      urlLink   part of a wall of mirrors that always reflect straight back at you – I was a ditz and used the flash.      Once the bus finally got there (like ½ an hour later), we rode it to a transit center in downtown Portland, but before we got off, we met an interesting couple that seemed rather... high. We (the four of us) had been talking about fire and explosives, specifically my friend and his dad blowing up a microwave in some random field on part of their property. These two college students who had just boarded the buss set about trying to convince us not to become Unabombers, but if we were going to, to become artistic Unabombers. The guy started going off on how the world needed more art and culture and less hate, while then girl started letting phrases she must have heard from a stoned professor somewhere fall out of her mouth like, “positive aura” “less negativity means a better life” and “peace not war, love not hate”. She was doing this is perfect combination with the rather elaborate movements her arms kept making at random intervals. HAHAHA We all burst out laughing for a full 30 seconds or so, as we drove away from the stop at which they had exited.  After waiting for another… ten or so minutes downtown, we boarded another bus which took us to the Oregon City Transit Center. In this bus we met another quirky, if not quite so amusing fellow who seemed to take a little too fond a liking to Ddee and Kristy. O, btw, he was drunk too. We were sitting at a right angle along the side and back of the bus, with Andrew one seat ahead of the guy, Ddee and Kristy two seats behind him and me two seats to their left. I was seriously thinking about just getting up and sitting between the guy and them since he was seriously making me nervous, but Andrew beat me to it by moving our stuff out of that seat and sitting between them and me. The guy procceded to give us a rather lengthy life story about how he was too rich and too smart to work, and how he grew the best pot in the state, right in his own backyard. I think we got him to think he wanted to get off at a sooner stop than he would have by how many times we asked him which stop was his, but who knows… maybe he did live there?  Once we got to the Oregon City Transit Center, we waited for another half hour or more for the next and final bus to arrive that would take us to what we have now dubbed as the POC (Piece Of Crap) Fair.  While we were waiting, Ddee and Kristy pretended to fight for at least 20 minutes. I took what would have been some better pictures of them doing that, but my camera SUCKS so none of them looked anywhere near good.    urlLink   I think Ddee just kicked Kristy, but I’m not sure.       urlLink   Kristy rushing Ddee.      urlLink   This thing is seriously attached to his head. (lol)    Once we got to the destination, we quickly realized it wasn’t as … [insert gratifying adverb here] as it was made out to be. We thought at first we should name it the kiddy fair, but we liked the other name better. I had a headache, so I just acted as coathanger while the other three went on the grand total of two rides (the only ones that weren’t geared toward the 4 foot and under crowd). I got some … fairly good pics of them on the first ride.    urlLink        urlLink        urlLink      (Ok, so one fairly decent pic of them, two fairly good pics of the ride – lol)  We spent a whole half hour of quality fun time at the fair and then proceeded back to the bus stop, where we waited for... over an hour for the next bus. The stop happened to be next to a building which had an overhanging roof over a porch. This was good for poor Ddee who was far too hot in a sweatshirt, in the blazing (relatively) sun.     urlLink   Andrew looks like he’s got the whole ape thing goin’ on, but don’t worry, he’s just on his cell.      urlLink   If this isn’t Hickville, then I don’t know what...      urlLink    My question is how to get the vehicle up there to begin with. Who knows, maybe YEEHAA’s 4x4 enough (man enough in the truck world)    After the bus finally got there, we had to share it with four rather intoxicated 20-some-odd year old guys who didn’t seem to have a problem spreading the news that yes, you will get drunk in the beer garden.  After we got back to Portland, we ate dinner in the lower food court of Pioneer Place 2. (I wish I’d gotten some pictures of that place, the fountains make it look sweet. :)  We had an uneventful bus ride back to the Washington Square (mall that we started at), and decided to browse around for a while, in search of a game for Andrew’s friend who’s b-day party I was taking him to.    urlLink   Andrew and me in the WS Summit bathrooms... see Ddee, this has nothing to do with showers ;)    HAHAHA, somehow I lost my key to my car at the fair (at least I think I lost it at the fair), so I had to call my parents and have them come give me a spare key. Once they left, I took everyone home, well everyone but Andrew who I took to a restaurant which preceded a sleepover he was going to. He had KrispyKreme for breakfast the next day (lucky dawg).     urlLink   Is she yawning?? I can’t tell.

      I didn't talk to her tonight. Well, actually it was last night, and I did talk to her, just not about that.   I got home from a *fun* day with  urlLink d'Dee ... (ok fine, Ddee) , her sister  urlLink Kristy  and  urlLink Andrew M. . Will post a TON more on that L8r, complete with some pics :)   Anyway, about Gwen: I got home from a *fun* da.... I just said that... ok moving on... Once I got home, I called her and asked if I could bring some DVDs and stuff that I had borrowed, up and she answered yes, but she seemed really tired. I drove them up and borrowed another DVD that my mom wanted (A Walk To Remember), but Gwen seemed so tired that I changed my previous plan of going back home and calling her to talk, to calling her tomorrow night.  btw, I got a messageboard up! :) Untill I set up my home-base webserver and translate my blog to that, I think this will do the job nicely. Though when I do start hosting from home, I'll get a little more elaborate.

      Listening to:  Andrew W. K. - Got To Do It   I had a long and meaningfull talk with my mom last night through this morning (Sorry Andrew, that's why I kept calling you back every half hour saying I was going to be longer - lol), and I'm feeling much better for it. She's great to talk too; it's amazing how much of this she understands. Anyway, I'm thinking (this was kinda her advice too) that I need to pull back from Gwen for a while, while this new relationship starts and give her some room to breath. I'm probably going to call her tomorrow night (well, tonight) and tell her that I know she's in a relationship with another guy now and I think I need to pull back and just let them figure each other out without my interaction as a hinderance. I'll probably finally say straight up that I'm in love with her and would be quite willing to have a closer relationship again should she so choose, but for the moment we need to tone down on how much we're communicating (i.e. I'm not going to call her every night and stay up for hours on end, talking anymore). I know that she wants to still keep our friendship alive, but I question whether our current interaction is really within the bounds of 'just a friendship'.  Feedback is more than welcome on this.

      *GRRRRAAAAAAAAAH!!!* to Comcast... my isp  (no not dialup). It cut out five minutes after I posted that last post, right when I need someone to talk too... Oh well, I just went to bed listening to  Sense Field - Save Yourself :  My self esteem, it's been low, go ahead and count it's been lower than low. / I know the feeling of it stealing life out from under me. / I want to learn, can you save yourself for someone who, loves you for you? / So many times we just give it away to someone who, couldn't even remember your name / Could you save yourself for someone who, loves you for you, loves me for me? / Give it away to someone who, someone who will cherish your name.   Hmm... speaking of music, I think I'll post some songs that I've been listening to / sing / humming / mumbling all day.  1.  AFI - This Time Imperfect    I cannot leave here.  I cannot stay. Forever haunted, more than afraid. Asphyxiate on words I would say. I'm drawn to a blackened sky as I turn blue.  There are no flowers, no, not this time. There will be no angels gracing the lines, just these stark words I find. I'd show a smile but I'm too weak. I'd share with you, could I only speak, just how much this hurts me.  I cannot stay here.  I cannot leave. Just like all I loved, I'm make-believe. Imagined heart, I disappear. Seems no one will appear here and make me real.  There are no flowers, no, not this time. There will be no angels gracing the lines, just these stark words I find. I'd show a smile but I'm too weak.   I'd share with you, could I speak, just how much this hurts me. I'd tell you how it haunts me.   Cuts through my day and sinks into my dreams. You don't care that it haunts me.  There are no flowers, no, not this time. There will be no angels gracing the lines, just these stark words I find. I'd show a smile but I'm too weak. I'd share with you, could I only speak, just how much this hurts me... just how much this hurts me...  just how much you...   2. the second half of  Drive Emerson - Only God (Could Stop Me Loving You)  (the beginning has some raunchy stuff in it)   Only God could stop me loving you Only God could tell me not to He sent you from heaven Just to make my dreams come true When he opened the door That you came walking through Only God could stop me loving you  There ain't no girl In the whole wide world Could tear us apart And there ain't no man Could steal your hand And tear us apart  But there is one God, In heaven above who gave me love strong enough, to calm my heart  Only God could stop me loving you Only God could tell me not to Only God could stop me loving you Only God could tell me not to Only God could stop me loving you   3. This one I heard on the radio three times today... kinda spoke to me, but I don't believe it in this case :|  Brooks Garth - Unanswered Prayers    Just the other night a hometown football game My wife and I ran into my old high school flame And as I introduced them the past came back to me And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be  She was the one that I'd wanted for all times And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then I'd never ask for anything again  Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers  She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams And I could tell that time had changed me In her eyes too it seemed We tried to talk about the old days There wasn't much we could recall I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all  And as she walked away and I looked at my wife And then and there I thanked the good Lord For the gifts in my life  Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers  Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs That just because he may not answer doesn't mean he don't care Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers  Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered... Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

      Feeling: umm... there's too much emotion rolling through me to allow me to 'feel' anything for a while...  Gwen and I just conversed (how or why... it doesn't matter anymore) and in the course of our brief conversation, she told me a name: Richard. I guessed and got it right; her new boyfriend.  I think it's time to blow the dust off the old stack of emo music and wallow for a while.  "This goes out to the one I love..."  ok, while's up...  *sniff*

      wow... long time no post. I promised Laurie that I'd post something tonight (well, this morning now...) but I also just promised Gwen that I would get to bed very soon, and you know how it is with girls - just can't turn them down (well.... for most things). So, I shall be brief.  Several of my computers are up and running including my main (soon to be sub-main) Windows box, which I am currently on.  I successfully reformatted it and installed the new OS, but dling all the new drivers and patches... well that's still taking some time. I just took then case apart again today to replace the old drab green and yellow LEDS with red and blue Super-brights. Man, what a difference... those things are powerful!  I talked to Laurie on IRC earlier today for the first time in... hmm almost a week.  We agreed that I would call her at 8 my time, 9 her's, tonight but, I FORGOT MY PHONE when I went to church!!! *grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr* to all things regrading my memory (lol).  I'm going to the beach tomorrow, kinda against my wishes... I had thought that the trip was planned for next week, but got canceled because of VBS... oh well.   I called Gwen around 10:30 tonight and got her dad. He told me that she would call me back shortly, so I waited for... well it turned out to be 45 minutes... not untill she called me back, but untill I started thinking and realized that my phone was back in the car again!!! (after I had gotten it out of the house, after I  had forgotten it when I wanted to call Laurie... lol). I went out and checked, and sure enough, she left a voicemail 25 minutes earlier. I called her back and evidently woke up her dad, but she said it didn't matter so whatever. At one point we were talking about the terrible amount of sleep I get and she kept trying to think of ways to get me to go to bed earlier. (lol) She wanted to talk to my mom, so I gave the phone to her and they conspired (I could hear the entire conversation, and contributed to it) to set a bedtime for me and how on earth to enfoce it. My mom suggested tying me to my bed every night for several weeks untill it became habit to get to bed that early, but I thought clorephorm (spelling?) would work better. (LOL) Eventually my mom gave the phone back to me, and Gwen and I continued talking, with my mom randomly grabing the phone from me now and then and interjecting comments like, "Well, we used to tell him when he was younger that 'If he weren't so cute, he'd be in a whole lotta' trouble by now'" (HAHAHAHA) My mom's great. Gwen was laughing about that for a while. 'Ne way, I did tell her I'd get to bed soon, so I should stop talking about us talking about me getting to bed soon, and get to bed soon :)   Sleep well, my beloved ones. Sleep well.

      I think I'll post about what's been happening (not much) over the last couple days, a little later today, though I will give this free piece of adivece: Sitting infont of two computers for 10 hours straight, burning backup cds so you can format them is INCREDIBLY boring.   Another great country song:     What The World Needs - Wynonna Judd    I look around at all the faces and I see All the lonely people looking back at me Rich,poor don't matter we're all the same Everybody's hungry in a different way We're clawing and climbing and kicking and screaming And fighting but really  What the world needs now is love Love and only love A little help from up above A way to make a better day Let's come together lay our difference down Spread it all around That's what the world needs now  La da la da da  Sometimes all it takes is just a smile To change somebody's weather chase the clouds out of the sky Sometimes you got to give and not receive Sometimes you got to live what you believe Open your arm's 'cause that's where it starts Right here with you and me  What the world needs now is love Love and only love A little help from up above A way to make a better day Let's come together lay our difference down Spread it all around That's what the world needs now  Nobody likes the cold We all need someone to hold No one wants to be alone  What the world needs now is love Love and only love A little help from up above A way to make a better day Let's come together lay our difference down Spread it all around (That's what the world needs now)  What the world needs now (What the world needs now is love) (Love and only love) Love and only love (A little help from up above) (A way to make a better day) Let's come together lay our prejudices down

                  HAHAHAHAHA, this is so great :) I was cruising the web earlier today and ran across  urlLink this site  on a link from another blog,  urlLink SuperfastComputer.com . It's dedicated to hosting a video growing ever more famous, called " urlLink Star Wars Kid ". The following is a quote from it:   Ghyslain, whose parents requested that his last name be withheld, is the so-called “Star Wars Kid” featured in a hilarious but oddly poignant video that has been downloaded more than a million times since its release to the Web in late April. In the clip, Ghyslain brandishes a golf ball retriever that serves as a double-bladed light saber, enthusiastically re-enacting a series of battle maneuvers inspired by the feats of evildoer Darth Maul in “Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace.” When a group of schoolmates discovered the videotape, they put it on the Internet, and within days it was a cause celebré.  The Ghyslain clip soon caught the attention of Web bloggers Andy Baio and Jish Mukerji, who posted it to their respective sites. Its obvious comedic appeal aside, Baio recognized in Ghyslain a kindred spirit. “I'm a computer programmer, and I was unpopular in high school, except for some like-minded, geeky friends,” Baio said. “Yes, he looks silly and awkward. But at the second level, you just identify so much.”  Visitors to Baio's site, www.waxy.org, began posting comments on the video — not all of them civil.  “Some of the comments were really positive. People were writing things like, ‘I was like him in high school,’” Baio said. “But a lot of them — a disturbing number — were incredibly mean-spirited. It made me mad. All of these people calling him ‘fat-ass’ or ‘loser,’ and it's completely hypocritical — I mean, all the traffic was coming from technology sites, videogame sites, and ‘Star Wars’ and ‘Star Trek’ sites.  “So I turned off the comment function, deleted the negative comments and posted a message to the effect that ‘You're trashing one of your own, and all you geeks and nerds and dorks need to evaluate how you're behaving.’”  When one of Ghyslain's schoolmates guilty of posting the video contacted Baio and mailed him the teen's contact information, Baio and Mukerji called Quebec. “[Ghyslain's] initial and understandable reaction was that he was unsure of my intentions,” Mukerji said. “But he opened up quickly. He's an intelligent young man. He was very guarded, but by the end of the conversation, he was very jovial.”  Baio and Mukerji didn't stop there. They established a Web fundraiser with the stated aim of collecting enough money to buy Ghyslain an iPod, and the response has far exceeded their expectations — as of May 19, they had amassed more than $1000, and thanks to an anonymous $500 donation, Baio expected the tally to top $2000 by the end of the day. The plan is to now buy Ghyslain his own iBook.  “The video was going to spread around the Web anyway — hopefully this will help, and if nothing else, he has an iBook to keep him company,” Baio said. “And he also learned that geeks look out for each other.”     urlLink  Sign the petition to get Ghyslain into Star Wars Episode III!

      Ok, stuff about last week that I haven’t yet told you: Gwen’s family was in California from Sunday ‘till well, the next other Sunday. (lol)  I was taking care of her dog Rascal (a beautiful white, Golden Retriever) all week while they were away (‘cept the last two days when her brother who’s in college was back in town). Two weeks ago, next Tuesday, I was at her house for a couple hours while they were showing me everything I needed to do. (btw, that was the day that she gave me a haircut)  For some reason they wanted to take the entire ride down to the Los Angels area (16 hour drive) in one day, so they planned to start out at 2 am. I called her at 1:30 to wake her if she wasn’t already up, but she had woken a couple minutes before I called.   I went to sleep and woke up around 8, before church Rascal seemed fine so I didn’t worry about her until later. After church, I went with Goody’s family over to a park near their house for a family reunion thingy (no I’m not part of their family… technically – lol). It was so stinking hot…I left their after an hour or so and went to the other side of town to another park where my dad’s small group (formerly also my mom’s) was having a picnic. Josh M, Jesh, Josiah and Emily were there, and we talked for a while. I got the opportunity to try out phone’s new AIM compatibility – it’s ok, but IT WON’T SIGN OFF WHEN YOU WANT IT TO!!! – Annoying since it seems to interfere with calls and other operations. Josh, Jesh, Josiah and I stayed a while after everyone else left then went to Josh’s house. On the way to Josh’s I stopped at Gwen’s house to take care of Rascal for a while and was rather stunned to see her (Rascal, not Gwen) hanging around outside the front door… At first I thought that I’d been extremely negligent and not locked the gate (which I know I check before I left), so I put her back into the yard and started the other direction to go check the mail. When Rascal suddenly appeared beside me again, I decided that I could not have been stupid enough to mistake the gate being locked twice, so I started to think about it for a minute and almost immediately I noticed the sizable hole in the fence and the corresponding hole that she dug in the ground under it. After much phone conversation, we determined that I shouldn’t board up the fence, only fill up the hole and that I should leave Rascal in the house during the day, not outside in the back yard. Because of this, I spent around an hour extra with her every evening just to keep her company.  Remember back in my June 22nd post, when I talked about how much of an impact Gwen has had on my life, and that I’ve never told her? Well I was planning to spend a considerable amount of time every day that she was gone, writing a letter which I would leave for her, explaining all of it. I had set it as a pretty high priority in my mind - that’s why I think it was by God’s hand that I did not write it… It was so important to me that I do, but whenever I would sit down and start to write, I would get sidetracked or not be able to concentrate or something. Weird. Oh well, I guess I’ll just have to trust Him and see what He will work through all this.  O, I wrote Gwen that email back when she was on the Canada trip (my July 8th post), and I was right (haha), she didn’t check her email for almost two months. :-D ‘Ne way, here’s her reply:    armaan, you were right about my e-mail habits. i thank you for the prayer and tell your  friends thank you for me too. tell them to keep praying that what happened on  the trip would have a lasting affect on their lives. stay happy gwen   So people who were praying, be ye thanked. :)  Oh, another thing, I sent her a backward survey a long time ago and she just sent it back to me. One of the questions was “do you love me?” she answered “as a friend and a brother in Christ”. When I sent it back to her, I thought about it for a while and wrote “I care about you in a way, not necessarily romantic, but still special.” It made sense to me at the time, but now as I look back on it, I find myself more leaning toward the word romantic as a describer again. Hmm… I dunno

        urlLink     umm...... ok..... moving on.....  Man, I've been running non-stop all week doing various things (most if not all of them fun), but have been getting very little sleep and am starting to lag behind on things that I had previously set as priorities.  On Wednesday night, our Senior Pastor was out of town, so  urlLink Pastor Bill Ritchie  from  urlLink Crossroads Community Church  came and gave a wonderful message. Man, that guy is funny. :) Probably one of the funniest this he did was call TBN the 'big hair channel'. (I'll post an audio clip of that later...) :-D He's really hard to record though; quite animated - constantly walking around the stage.  Chatting on Youthfire yesterday morning was interesting... Everyone was talking about butts from the time that I got on till a couple hours later... specifically Chelsea gawking about a pic of Phil's butt that Sam took... umm... yeah... next subject.  Youth group last night was cool, the majority of the Junior High was (is still) on an all-week campout, so it was just the 40-or-so of us Senior Highers. Everything was really impromptu. Steven and I randomly got up and led worship with Andrew (who played the guitar) then Ryan finished a series on a book title The Case For Christ. Was a pretty good book to read and study through. I'd recommend it to anyone.  Later after youth group was finished - about 9, I called Laurie again and talked to her for around ten minutes. It's kinda funny; I was running all over the place trying to help set up sound stuff for some people (Steven, Matt, Jeremy, Adam and Kelly) while talking to her. She had limited time to talk, so I handed her over to Steven after about ten minutes then they talked for... four or five minutes then he gave her back to me and we said goodbye. Haha, it was nice talking to her for more than 40 seconds this time. :)  Great "All-American" country song:    Keith Urban - Where The Blacktop Ends lyrics    Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  I'm lookin' down the barrel of Friday night Ridin' on a river of freeway lights Goodbye city I'm country bound 'Til Monday rolls around  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  Workin' in the grind is an uphill road Punchin' that clock and carryin' that load I bust it all week and then I'm free The weekend belongs to me  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  Give me some fresh air give me that farm Give me some time with you in my arms Far away from the hustle and the pressure and the noise  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul, you betcha  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  Where the blacktop ends Where the blacktop ends Where the blacktop ends

      Man Friday night was funny. Cameran came over and we and my sister and her friend (who also spent the night) burned and melted stuff outside for like two hours. We started creating 'pyro art' or something in the air with WD40 by catching the flame with it and moving the stream all over the place then passing the flame back and forth from person to person. Hey, did you know that melting plastic bags make a really cool 'ziiiiiiiing' sound when they drip? O, or did you know that glowsticks explode when you toss them in a fire? (LOL)  Come Saturday, Cam and I went over to the Gadeholt's house from when 'Uncle' Greg, 'Auntie' Irene, Timy and we went to Multnomah Falls (3rd highest in N. America) and climbed 8 miles from the base up to Larch Mountain. The entire assent was something like a 4,900 foot increase in elevation. The average grade of the trail we followed was 13.75%. After the fourth hour or so, Cam, Timy and I discovered that it was actually easier to run up certain parts of the trail than to walk up. :) The scenery was spectacular though - myriads of little waterfalls running down the stream on either side of the trail. At one point, we spent a good 20 minutes hurtling boulders into part of the stream... When I stopped for a moment and asked the cliff face (the direction that I was looking) why we were doing it, Uncle Greg responded "Because it's there". HAHA   Man school's backing up and I've got even more h/w than usual... have no idea why I'm even taking time to write this (lol) Goodnight.

      Man,  Lonestar - Not a Day Goes By  is such good (i.e. sad) song....   Got a picture of you I carry in my heart Close my eyes to see it when the world gets dark Got a memory of you I carry in my soul I wrap it close around me when the nights get cold If you asked me how I'm doin' I'd say just fine But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind  Not a day goes by that I don't think of you After all this time you're still with me it's true Somehow you remain locked so deep inside Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by  I still wait for the phone in the middle of the night Thinkin' you might call me if your dreams don't turn out right And it still amazes me that I lie here in the dark Wishin' you were next to me, your head against my heart If you asked me how I'm doing I'd say just fine But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind  Not a day goes by that I don't think of you After all this time you're still with me it's true Somehow you remain locked so deep inside Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by  Minutes turn to hours, and the hours to days Seems it's been forever that I've felt this way  Not a day goes by that I don't think of you After all this time you're still with me it's true Somehow you remain locked so deep inside Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

      Ok, well I'm still up and Ddee wanted me to post, so I think I will. Mind you though that it'll be tiny cause I'm tired and want to get to bed.  I just got back from my school's annual Fall retreat to Winema, a Christian campground on the beach. This Winema was one of many firsts for me: It was the first one I've been to as a junior. it was the first time I've been there and not climbed on, or even seen for that matter, the 60 foot tall rock on the shoreline that everyone loves. It's the first time I've felt God lead me not to get into the worship, it's the first time I've hung out with... almost every group of people for an extended period of time. It's the first time I've felt unwanted by the class above me (if only for a short while) and it's also the first time I've ever missed someone so much who was there with us the entire time.  Sometimes firsts are good, and other times...  Goodnight ... may we all die restfully in our sleep that we may escape this world and all its grief.

      No, I'm not dead, I'm still very much alive and running :) ... and actually that's exactly the problem... oh, no not the alive part, I'm refering to the running part. You see, this school year and the weeks leading up to it have proven to be the busiest I've ever had. With all the homework and other activities I have going, this is the first time I've even gotten on the web recreationally, in... 5 days... yeah that sounds about right. The only reason I'm posting is I may not have time to email Laurie back, replying to her voicemail(s) ~lol~ earlier and I wanted to get through to her that I had gotten them, if for some unforseen reason I could not call her back tomorrow. Incidently, those voicemails only became voicemails because my STUPID PHONE DECIDED TO DIE ON ME EARLIER TODAY!!! (Don't worry it's better now, but the battery still has issues.) Anyway, I have no idea how frequently I will be able to keep posting for a while, but let me assure you that I haven't forgotten about all ya`   I miss yah all you Youthfire'ers, hopefully will chat again soon!  ~Armaan_running

      CAM'S NOT MOVING!!! The company his dad applied for already found someone for the job! :) Sweetness.  This Friday, Andrew and I are prolly staying over night at Cam's then we're all going back over to Andrew's ... not sure what we're gonna do to fill the time but it should be interesting.   I'm really sucking at school right now... Calc. and Spanish are still Fs and Sign's starting to head down that way too... I have had so many phreaking 1st period tardies that every time I'm tardy do, I get ISS (LOL). Thankfully it's only once a week, but still ... crazy. I keep missing key days in Chemistry so I'm behind in that right now too... not sure what I'm going to do... My uncle's thinking it might be best to drop Calc. do preCalc for another year, but that would seriously screw with my class lineup... not something I'm hoping for.   Anyway, I've got a paper that's worth 16 grades due in Senior English tomorrow, so I'd better get going... not sure if I'm gonna be on tonight, but whatever...  O, btw I'm going to a opera on Nov. 6th with a group that Rachael’s' (am I spelling your name correctly?) conveniently a part of (thankyouthankyou now I’m not going to be stuck with just 9 middle schoolers - nothing against them as a whole... just this particular bunch can be sometimes rather ... annoying). I've invited Cam and Ddee too, and I might even be able to get Josh to go along, but so far only Cam and Ddee are showing interest. (Andrew, wanna get some culture? WELL THEN STAY AT HOME WHILE THE REST OF US GO TO THE OPERA!!! ... jk jk, but I really doubt that would be your 'cup of tea')

      Man, I'm dying daily untill Friday.... This is going to suck soooo bad if Cam's moving. God...   to all the people who don't already know: Cam's dad's all excited about a potential job offer that would relocate his family to Texas... They were originally going to know today whether he got it or not, but the date's been moved to Friday. His mind seems to be made up: he gets the position and they're moving. It'll prolly take like two months to get ready and stuff, but then again there's no guarantee that they'll even be here for Thanksgiving.  holy crap, this is going to suck...

All the days you spent with me Now seem so far away And it feels like you don’t care anymore And now I try hard to make it I just want to make you proud I'm never gonna be good enough for you I can’t stand another fight And nothing’s alright  'Cuz we lost it all Nothing lasts forever I'm sorry  I can't be perfect Now it's just too late And we can't go back I'm sorry  I can't be perfect  Nothing’s gonna change the things that you said And nothing’s gonna make this right again Please don’t turn your back I can’t believe it’s hard  Just to talk to you But you don’t understand  'Cuz we lost it all Nothing lasts forever I'm sorry  I can't be perfect Now it's just too late And we can't go back I'm sorry I can't be perfect  'Cuz we lost it all Nothing lasts forever I'm sorry  I can't be perfect Now it's just too late And we can't go back I'm sorry I can't be perfect

      I'm tired and ned to do some homework, clean my room and practice piano, but I'm going to Ddee's office in a minute for a bible study so I guess that'll all have to wait until I get back.   I'm reather unhappy about some of the scores I've been getting in subjects at school, particularly Spanish and AP Calc. I got flippin' 48% on my last Spanish test! 'Course it doesn't help that I didn't study anywhere near enough for it (lol). Oh, and I've already gotten ISS (In School Suspension) for tardies this early into the year. I drop my sister off at her school before I get to mine almost every morning, but her school's really weird about their closed campus policies. They won't even let her get out of the car until one of the staff opens the door for her. It's sooo stupid and it's costing my my GPA (ISS means less time in the class, which means less time learning).   Oh well, I'd better head over to Portline. See yah'all later~

      Grrr.... annoyance of annoyances - I'm borrowing Brady's iPod, uploading a ton of music on it, and copying it all onto Andrew H's computer, but things are being temperamental... First, the iPod was formatted using the newer Mac filing system which is all well and good when listening to music or syncing to a Mac, but I happen to be an all-pc guy (hope to change that soon) and so does Andrew H. It seemed that the only thing to do was to reformat the iPod with a FAT32 filing system and reload the OS. I was reluctant to do that because I wanted to upload some of Brady's music onto my computer as well, and reformatting it obviously erases all the data, so that wouldn't work. I started experimenting with random pc-based apps that allow communication with Mac formatted media. Finding little to no success in this, I was about to give up until I found Xplay, the app that made iPods for pc uses possible when the only format you could encode an iPod in was Mac. I installed that, but unfortunately, there was a data transfer problem in which the entire computer would lockup and eventually bluescreen. I retried this approach twice, but decided to discard since I was getting nowhere fast. I downloaded iPod OS 2.1 and used the installed to reformat the iPod. This took substantially less time that I had expected and I figured I was home free from this point on. Not so. My firewire port was evidently messed up, more often than not, it would only allow a small portion of a song to transfer before giving me some type of error message. I eventually gave up on that and decided to switch to usb, but that had its own complications: first, the high-speed (usb 2.0) controller wasn’t loaded, so the connection was heinously slow. Second, the usb port does not power the iPod, but the firewire does, so I had to concoct an elaborate set of steps in order to reconnect the iPod whenever I wanted to transfer something: plug in the firewire, take five minutes (because the comp. kept freezing during this time) to disable it, and then plug in the usb and hope that everything worked. If not, I would have to restart the iPod and sometimes manually power down the entire computer and restart it.

      LOL, this is funny:  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=thefirebreathes.blogspot.com  (it may take a while to render though...)  you can browse almost any site like this, simple add  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=  before the rest of the ULR. For instance, if you wanted to browse www.yahoo.com in ... color ... (lol), you'd take the  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=  and add  yahoo.com  to form  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=yahoo.com   This seems to work for all html-based websites exept for a few notible ones (like  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=google.com ) that happen to have a different default language than http://www.malfunction.org/ 's and display the page in German among other things.

      I added something new to my blog, it's called  Web Fire Escape . It’s an interesting concept: imagine you're checking someone's blog at school or at work and your teacher / manager / any person you don't want to see the site walks up. With this tool you can simply click a link and immediately go to a website or application of your choice. The link  urlLink    is customizable, via a cookie that you can obtain from Gary (the creator)'s  site . My and Steven's redirection site of choice is  this .

      Listening to:  Offspring - Something To Believe In  Feeling: cheerful, happy  LOL My friend in English got a text message from his girlfriend at Jesuit that it was snowing, and the entire school was in an uproar in under an hour... a big group of people were going on a leadership retreat to the coast and if it's snowing down here it's bad news for a bus full of people crossing the Cascades. They were going to leave after school, but they decided to leave at noon to try and make it through the pass before they were snowed in.   Attendance has been down since Monday on account of random illnesses. In Calc today, we had three people. (lol) I love that class even though I currently suck at it. I've been thinking that I need to be tutored in order to get out of the rut that I'm in in that class, but the more I contemplate it, I realize that I just need to take it more seriously. If I spent half the time on hw for it that I did on this computer... dang.  Btw, I'm going to try to start posting more regularly now: every day, and prolly will start using this for more of a personal itinerary blog and journal than a diary. Most of my old posts were me pouring my heart out and everything, but I've got way too many people checking this thing now to be safe using it for that LOL  'Ne wayz, Ben's coming over in a few, so I need to go give my room some attention. Adios~

      Now that we've all had a day to think about it, and had some second opinions from a mechanic and such, it's starting to look like the entire accident wasn't my fault. First of all, the damage to my car shows that the max speed I could have been going was 5 mph. Also, in an intersection (like that one) that has no markings (stop signs etc...) the right of way always goes to the person on the right.  I was on the right.

      Ok, so I'm driving from the far side of Movies on TV (a theater, whose name is a spoof on the highway it borders - Tualatin Valley, or TV Highway) parking lot, toward one of three entrances, intent on exiting the property, when ahead of me, from my left, a Camry drives into view behind a blind corner (blind, only by the cars parked at it, not by nature of the corner itself). We are quite close to each other, each of us moving at a fairly rapid pace for a parking lot, but I do have just enough distance to stop and clear them if I slam on the brakes. Now, my brakes are of an odd sort - to begin with they're in a '92 Corolla, so anti-lock is not a possibility (or at least, not much of one). Second, even though they are quite powerful (I have come to a dead stop, decelerating from 55 mph in under 3 seconds on at least one occasion), the position of the petal is rather obscure. The accelerator, in perspective to the brake, is recessed almost two (maybe more, not quite sure now actually) inches. Furthermore, the width of clearance between the brake and the ‘wall’ or sorts to the right of the gas is almost identical to that of my shoes. Ok, now back to the story: Bearing all of this is mind, it’s easier to understand how, when I try to rapidly transition from gas to brake, my foot becomes stuck underneath the brake petal and when I floor what I think is the brake, I’m actually swiftly accelerating. Now, I’m sure the outcome of this petal orientation issue is readily apparent, so it goes almost without saying that I strike the Camry, even while attempting to swerve out of the way. What is not readily apparent though is that the damage that occurs to my left, front wheel upon impact jams it into a hard-right turn and sends me careening straight at a parked month-old Lancer. Thankfully, there is a small curb and sidewalk between my still accelerating car (foot stuck behind brake petal, remember?) and the shiny new, well-into-the-five-digit costing vehicle in front of me, that manages to catch my right wheel (the only one at this point free to steer) and allows me to narrowly miss totaling the Lancer, and instead simply remove the right rear tail light. By the time I am nearly passing the object which turned this into a three car accident, I have managed to disentangle my foot and sharply apply my brake… little good that it did with my left wheel banking sharply against the other three though.   All in all, the entire left side of my car is heavily marred, the driver door is bent, the left front wheel's hydraulics are destroyed (estimated $400 repair), and the right front bumper is imploded. The Camry got most of the body in front of the engine removed, and the top of the right wheel well is pretty much gone too. The Lancer had the most minimal damage, but possibly the most costly, seeing as it's less than a frigin' month old.

      HAHAHA, let's all thank Ddee for this ... interesting email:   In Japan, they have replaced the impersonal and unhelpful Microsoft Error messages with Haiku poetry messages. Haiku poetry has strict construction rules. Each poem has only three lines, 17 syllables: five syllables in the first line, seven in the second, five in the third.   Haikus are used to communicate a timeless message often achieving a wistful, yearning and powerful insight through extreme brevity — the essence of Zen:   Your file was so big.  It might be very useful.  But now it is gone.   The Web site you seek  Cannot be located, but  Countless more exist.   Chaos reigns within.  Reflect, repent, and reboot.  Order shall return.   Program aborting:  Close all that you have worked on.  You ask far too much.   Windows NT crashed.  I am the Blue Screen of Death.  No one hears your screams.   Yesterday it worked.  Today it is not working.  Windows is like that.   First snow, then silence.  This thousand-dollar screen dies  So beautifully.   With searching comes loss  And the presence of absence:  "My Novel" not found.   The Tao that is seen  Is not the true Tao-until  You bring fresh toner.   Stay the patient course.  Of little worth is your ire.  The network is down.   A crash reduces  Your expensive computer  To a simple stone.   Three things are certain:  Death, taxes and lost data.  Guess which has occurred.   You step in the stream,  But the water has moved on.  This page is not here.   Out of memory.  We wish to hold the whole sky,  But we never will.   Having been erased,  The document you're seeking  Must now be retyped.   Serious error.  All shortcuts have disappeared.  Screen. Mind. Both are blank.

      On the  Matrix, Revolutions : (a portion of a  review from MSNBC.com ) "there’s still too much dialogue that comes from the “wherever you go, there you are” school of circuitous profundity."   Ever since the disappointment of “Reloaded,” there’s been some question as to whether it was a good idea to spring another “Matrix” installment on moviegoers within the same calendar year. Remember what happened to “Back to the Future 3,” released just a few months after “Back to the Future 2”? It faded so quickly that most fans of the original didn’t even realize the series had switched genres, from time-travel fantasy to full-scale Western.  Nevertheless, the third installment in the “Matrix” trilogy is already here, and there is no genre-switching. Alas. Once more, Neo the potential messiah (Keanu Reeves) is joined by his main squeeze Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and the fatherly Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to do battle with a software-created world and the shape-shifting malevolence of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).     Once more there are multiple Smiths (and Weavings), and they’ve taken over the body of Neo’s schizzy shipmate, Bane (Ian Bliss). The reluctant Frenchman Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) is persuaded to help out, while The Oracle, chain-smoking dispenser of cookies and fortune-cookie wisdom, turns up in the shape of Mary Alice. (The late Gloria Foster played her in the first two films, and the change is cutely acknowledged.)  Unlike “Reloaded,” this new “Matrix” doesn’t leave the audience hanging in mid-narrative. Producer Joel Silver claims this really is the end, even if the finale does hint at more installments to come. But “Revolutions” still makes most of the same mistakes as “Reloaded.”   The Wachowskis, Andy and Larry, replace clever plotting with furious action, then substitute massive sets and special effects for character development. And there’s still too much dialogue that comes from the “wherever you go, there you are” school of circuitous profundity.   Under the circumstances, the actors can do little but stay out of the way of the heavy machinery — which includes a ferocious drill that breaks through Neo’s pals’ defenses and threatens to wipe out the human race. There’s a “Star Trek” cheesiness about too many of the performances; the romantic chemistry between Reeves and Moss has never been harder to buy.  A few touches surprise: an impromptu trip through a packed disco, the brutal exit of one major character, and a subway stop that operates on principles similar to Harry Potter’s train station. Neo finds himself stranded in this purgatory, punished by a grotesque creature who thinks he’s God and won’t let him leave.  “OK, you got yourself in here,” says Neo to himself. “You can get yourself out.” The way Reeves says it, he might be thinking about his career.

      I don't know how this is going to work... I get too attached to things and it’s sooo hard to let go. What’s happening now is that there’s a very high possibility that I’m going to be switching schools within the coming weeks. I can’t function at mine right now; it’s becoming more and more apparent the more research we do, that I’ve got a rather severe form of ADD that’s really effecting my ability to learn at Faith. I’m really saddened by the prospect because I’ve got some wonderful friends there, and not to say that I’ll be losing those friends automatically when I leave, it’s just going to be a huge amount harder… There is one bright side to all this though… the school that I might be transferring to is Beaverton High, Steven’s school.

      Listening to: The Ataris – Boys of Summer  Saturday, I was really depressed all day long and for some reason, didn’t sleep at all that night. I read Steven’s blog at something like 5am and in it he said that he was prolly pulling an all-nighter, and sure enough, he was on aim, so we talked for a couple hours. He bailed though and slept through church (lol). I got back home and slept from 2pm till past 7:30pm. At something like 8:30, someone knocked at my door, and assuming it was my sister (who was currently being hyper with three equally hyper friends), I opened it. It turned out to be Adri who was returning my overcoat that I had left at her house last week. Eventually we (Melissa too, who was with Adri) went over to Josh’s house from some reason, picked him up and went to the Gadeholts. We stayed there for a bit then visited Christine the restaurant where she works, visited Josh’s brother at his work, and went to Starbucks. We went back to Adri’s house with our drinks and ice cream (obtained from the restaurant) in tow, but left again because we didn’t want to wake up her parents with all our noise. We went back to the Gadeholt’s house (Christine was off work by this time) and ate our ice cream and such… Since it was approaching midnight, we decided to get back to our houses, and on the way back to mine, we noticed that the snow that had been falling all night was finally sticking :) (lol - awesomeness). Once Adri and Melissa (who was staying at Adri’s) got back home, they called me and we talked for… 3 hours and 20-something minutes (lol).   I woke up just before noon today and got ready to go out to lunch with my grandparents. Before we got there though, we stopped at a couple random parking lots Southridge etc… and did some power-driving on the slick roadways. Man, that’s a nice VW that they have :). We went out for lunch, went back to house, and Ralph and I took off to go get me some experience driving a manual transmission on slick roads. Turns out that I’m too big for the driver’s seat of his truck (lol – annoying non-moving steering column).

And this wall is so much stronger, Than everything that I've seen before.   In your eyes, I see flowers and trees.  In your eyes, I see beautiful things I can't believe.  Cause in your eyes I see the love that shine on me.  In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes.  I see the blue skies bring some rain I feel the blood rush in my veins I never want to see you cry. Recently you said good night, Did not believe it for a while But you really meant goodbye.  In your eyes I see the sun shine.  It's so bright that I can't see.  And this wall is so much stronger,  Than everything that I've seen before.   Well, have a Merry Christmas and such! I’m off to hear my mom’s concert and then to my grandma’s house to have a little family get-together.

      Well, I guess I should write a bit about the last few days, so here goes:  On Friday, before I even left school, Cam, Xbox in tow, got to my house. I joined him shortly (lol) and he gave me a pair of gay, see-through, Santa Claus boxers (LOL). Andrew arrived with his Xbox and TV around 7 that night and we set about setting the three consoles up, interconnected via my home network. We did random stuff including watching several movies until Andrew and I finally bedded down close to 6am (Cam had taken shelter and fallen asleep in our large unfinished basement / storage area adjacent to my room back at 3am.  Cam woke up at 8 and finally got me up at 10:30. We both then dragged Andrew out of the storage area, into my room where he refused to actually get up till past 11 (lol). Ddee, Kristy, and Brady got to my house just past noon and we all waited with baited breath (…er, no) for everyone else to arrive at 1:30. In all, the attendees were Cam, Andrew, Brady, Kristy, Ddee, Vlad, both Katies, Kelli, Steven, Brandon, Josh, Jennifer, Adri, Melissa, Kat, Becky, Mandy, Danie, Lisa, Young Hee, my family and me. We did so many random things over the course of the afternoon that I can barely remember specifics. When my parents finally got home (a couple hours late) with the pizzas etc, we started planning how we were going to get over to Zoo Lights. Eventually, everyone who was coming had a ride figured out, and it ended up that Steven, Adri and I were all riding with Brady.   We had fun at Zoo Lights. We rode the train, admired the lights shining through the mist (… fog… whatever), group hugged random people dressed up as animals… you know, same ol’, same ol’. Most of us stopped for Coffee at Starbucks on the way back… Adri and Steven got into some type of signing war, er, I don’t know what was going on (lol). Anyway, once we got back home, almost everyone had left, save Steven and Brady (who were staying the night) and Adri, Melissa and Katie. Adri stayed a while after even after Katie and Melissa left – that was cool, we all talked for a while. Right after she left (past 12) we went down to Steven’s house and grabbed his computer paraphernalia. Later, Steven Brady and I pulled one of the servers out of the garage, and worked for a few hours, but got almost nothing accomplished except for downloading a few drivers onto my computer. We went to sleep close to 3:30 (or at least I did…)  [Um… It’s like what? 1:22am, and Brent just called me and asked if I had my car. I’m like “Nooo… why?”, and he’s all “Ok, talk to you later then, bye”. … strange kid (LOL)]  … Anyway, We woke up the next morning somewhere between 10am and 1pm (don’t remember) and spent all the time working on the server and copying files back and for between Steven’s and my computer. We called and told Adri that we’d be at her part like an hour and a half early, but we sorta lagged behind and got there within 15 minutes of 5, the official start. We brought my Xbox but didn’t set it up until an hour later when Brady, Steven and I went back to my house and grabbed a TV. Later, Melissa and I went out to exchange the dvd that Adri had rented (the Ring) because it was horribly scratched. That was annoying because they didn’t have another dvd edition in stock, so we had to settle for a vhs. I heard that Brady kinda made a fool out of himself while I was gone, and I kinda noticed it a bit when I got back too. He just gets too… [Insert lengthy, complete silence as all who know, contemplate how to describe it] ...in a big group of people. Whatever…Oh, incidentally, Gwen was there and brought Richard, who I finally got to meet (well… ‘see’ is the more appropriate word… there was no ‘meeting’ involved). Once they left, I was like, holy crap, now I can act normal again.  Steven stayed the next night again and came with us to a dinner at Madison House, a division of Good Samaritan ministries. We found a ton of Linux stuff on the fourth floor and a collection of something like a thousand Star Trek movies (and episodes on tape) in a movie room on the first floor.

      At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated: "If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got 1000 miles to the gallon." In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating the following.  If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics:  1. For no reason whatsoever your car would crash twice a day.  2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a new car.  3.  Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would just accept this, restart, and drive on.  4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn, would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to re-install the engine.  5. Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought "Car95" or "CarNT". But, then you would have to buy more seats.  6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five per cent of the roads.  7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single "general car fault" warning light.  8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt.  9. The airbag system would say "Are you sure?" before going off.  10. Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key, and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.  11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50 percent or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Dept.  12. Every time GM introduced a new model car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.  13. You'd press the "Start" button to shut off the engine.   found at  http://www.people.vcu.edu/~gasaunde/if_gm_built_cars___.htm

      Steven and I are working on those servers currently. We found we're lacking something called a Smart Start CD for configureing the SCSI arrays... we might be able to find an iso that works but itls highly doubtful.... We may have to shell out $22 for buying it off the Compaq site.

      I got this in an email from ddee. It can be found at  http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/physics.asp  I'm currently printing multiple copies of it and plan on handing them out tomorrow at school. (LOL)   The Physics of Santa and His Reindeer  No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has ever seen.   There are two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. BUT since Santa doesn't appear to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total — 378 million according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there's at least one good child in each.   Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second.   This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75½ million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc.   This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.   If every one of the 91.8 million homes with good children were to put out a single chocolate chip cookie and an 8 ounce glass of 2% milk, the total calories (needless to say other vitamins and minerals) would be approximately 225 calories (100 for the cookie, give or take, and 125 for the milk, give or take). Multiplying the number of calories per house by the number of homes (225 x 91.8 x 1000000), we get the total number of calories Santa consumes that night, which is 20,655,000,000 calories. To break it down further, 1 pound is equal to 3500 calories. Dividing our total number of calories by the number of calories in a pound (20655000000/3500) and we get the number of pounds Santa gains, 5901428.6, which is 2950.7 tons.   The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that "flying reindeer" (see above) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload (not even counting the weight of the sleigh) - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth. 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each.   In short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second. Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times greater than gravity. A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.   In conclusion: If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's dead now.

      Well, we went and saw LotR: RofK today at 8:00 pm (well... no, yesterday since it's past midnight... which also means I'M 17! *yay*) I must say that it's done much better than I thought it would be.

      Yesterday evening, I went to my school's Christmas program and stayed for the full 90 or so minutes of it. That was pretty cool... there was one part where all the lights were turned off except a powerful black light in the middle of the stage, and people signed a song wearing black clothes with white gloves, so all you could really see were their hands.   Afterward, Adrie and I went to my youth group (there was still a half-hour or something left). It was the first time I've been there in over a month. Steven (not Sus, a youth leader) was talking about how we can still honor God in Christmas celebration by making the whole thing about Him, even though almost every symbol of the holiday and the holiday itself has pagan roots. Later Melissa and Gwen came for some reason... that was um... awkward... yeah  Anyway, Adrie, Steven and I eventually went back with Ben to his house for a bit to see his newly painted room. It's really cool - the wall that his organ sits against has a red sun painted on it such that the organ's in the center of the sun and rays of red shoot out across a yellow and orange sky. It looks really cool.

      Well, I woke up at 6:30 to my cell phone's alarm, turned it off, and went straight back to bed. The next time I remember waking up was after 8:30 and all I remember about that was having a terrible headache, congestion and nausea. ... Wonderful.... Now after eating breakfast at 12:30 and drinking a phreaking ton of water, I feel much better, but I'm still not completely over the headache.   Odd.

      Music Mood:  the Offspring - Denial, Revisited   So, yeah my dad surprised me with a new car a couple days ago... that was really nice of him. (New means new to me, not actually new.) It's a '95 Toyota Camry LE. It's the newer body style (a plus over the other one), it's got like, one tiny scratch, it drives great and it's just all around a wonderful car... Except for one fatal flaw... It stinks of cig smoke. Yeah, it sux bad... that stuff doesn't come out ever, oh you can clean the interior as well as you want, but leave it out in the sun long on a hot day and that smell will come seeping out of the metal in the roof and make the car reek again. Trouble is that among my dad's slowly failing senses, he's partially lost his sense of smell so he doesn’t know how bad it really is. Plus the fact that he's the type of guy that won't believe that there's a hole in the middle of the road ahead of him until he slides right into it himself, so we can tell him all we want that the smell's not coming out and he's gonna try to get it out anyway. I feel really bad about pressing the issue because whenever I talked about the other car, I was almost always complaining (And very justifiably, that car had a butt load of problems), but he spent like, 5 hours at the dealer's auction just to get this car for me and I want to show my appreciation for that. But then again as Andrew aptly said, I "won't ever have to smoke, just keep the car for two years and it'll do the same thing."  Ah the problems of life...

      What I meant in my rather abrupt post earlier is that people around me for some reason try and find something wrong with someone, create a bandwagon, try to drag as many people onto it as they can, then set out to run over the person. It happens all too frequently... First the thing with Brady and the Rivas' .... I DON'T CARE WHO'S ****ING FAULT IT IS... GET OVER IT. (I know almost everyone has by now, but there are the lingering few). And then the stint with Cameran right after that... so he decides to try and get from all the emotional politics for a bit... big deal.   But what really honestly ticks me off is all the little bickering and nitpicking that goes on between people WHO'VE NEVER EVEN MET FACE TO FACE.... for God's sake... I mean, get a life... there are better issues to get bent out of shape about than your suddenly loosing your 73rd online friend because your 21st IMed them behind your proverbial back and they both decided they didn't like you.   Becky, you're right about people (including me) not helping at all by posting demeaning things or leaving demeaning comments on other's blogs, but I still think you could've been a little more tactful with the posting of your little altered poem there. You're right about it being your journal, diary, whatever, but it's also been transformed into a means of communication to other people simply by virtue of its being accessible to essentially all humanity. Because of this fact, we have an obligation to censor our blogs to some extent to protect others and ourselves.

      Current Music:  Nina Gordon - Tonight and the Rest of My Life   Well, here I am nearly at 2:00am... on a school night... again... I've been finding myself doing this a lot lately and I think I've finally figured out why I deprive myself of sleep so often: I don't want to think. When I go to bed, I simply lie there, sometimes for hours, and over analyze every situation from my past or possibilities in the future that I can think of. I'll critique myself over and over again, sometimes focusing for days at a time on the same random event in my past that for some reason has been brought to mind. It's maddening to say the least. I feel like I'm slowly... every so slowly, going insane.  In related news, it would seem that my attention issues are getting steadily worse. I'm prolly going to have to forgo OMTA syllabus this year since I can't get my act together and practice regularly. This saying nothing about my completely failing my junior year... yeah, ain't life jolly?  Oh, one major point of happiness at the moment is that my school's Winter Banquette got cancelled because of the ice, so... I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER ALL!!!! *dances around*  ...We really should get a band of people together and rent a limo...  O, and there was one other thing that had me pretty happy today but I won't go into it.  And rest assured that I'm working hard to get the hundred or so pics from Vegas up, but it's turning out to be an undertaking of some proportion trying to find the names of all the different $20,000 - $160,000 speakers that I took pics of.  Pics that I've uploaded so far can be found  here .  Appendum: I just read Steven's latest post about not being motivated to do anything, even stuff that he wants to do, so I decided to add this to mine as well: I think that's also a major issue (dang I need a calculator to count all my issues now...) that I'm facing... I'll come home from school and simply sit around, not doing anything... no coding, no reading (I used to LOOOOOOVE reading), no random computer stuff.. I don't really even want to get into bed... I just sorta lose my will to do anything at all and just sit there... and sit there...   God I need help...

      Well, we drove through 160 miles of fog so dense, visibility was limited at times to less than 50 feet… We hit a freak patch of ice, spun around more than two times while sailing over 100 feet across the freeway, hit a snow bank going backwards and ricocheted around before coming to a stop. Total damage to vehicle: …We’re still trying to find the damage… we can’t see any. Then, we drove another 30+ miles over icy roads and finally got back home. Oh, and that was all just this morning between 1 and 4 am.

      Good God, I hesitate to even post this, but... it must be done...  Gene Ray, a (to quote  urlLink Waxy.org ) "highly entertaining nutcase", says that there are four different simultaneous days within a single rotation of earth, and if you laugh at this, "you're stupid and evil and deserve to be spit on publicly." Before reading on, let me caution you by saying that anything within your reach while reading this article, is not safe: uncontrollable urges to destroy your monitor may follow.... That having been said, let me introduce his profound (¿) ideology by quoting the first sentence on his site:     Creation of 4 simultaneous 24 hour days, within a single rotation of Earth, empowers me above all 1-day gods and educated stupid scientists. I will wager $10,000.00 on it.   He continues with another onslaught of wordy blather that, when sifted through, leaves him calling himself schizophrenic (which he misspells) and youthful, claiming to be above the "Wise Men" because of his establishing a "Chair of Wisdom", and goes on to curse Tom Green of all people, claiming him to be evil...  And that's just the next three sentences...  From  urlLink here  you can download his  urlLink interview  on TechTV, and if you really insist on torturing yourself, his homepage is  urlLink here   O, and I think he's watched a bit too much Peter Pan:  "Unless the children organize into a powerful force to stop the adult ramsacking of Nature, they must now prepare for the coming adult inflicted hell on Earth.

      Enter   urlLink Earthstation 5 . You remember them don't you? The peer-to-peer software developer, hosted in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, that  declared war  on the entertainment industry and told them to "f*** off"? Well, seems they've grown a bit... In the occupied Palestinian territories, says Steve Taylor, a spokesman, Earth Station 5 is safe from the music and film industries' campaign to stop people sharing content for free. At any one time, claims Mr Taylor, almost 19m people are using Earth Station 5, most in non-English-speaking countries. If true, that would make it the most popular peer-to-peer file-sharing portal in the world. At the moment, everything is free on the platform, and it has no advertising. According to Mr Taylor, its backers are spending $2million a month with little if any revenue coming in. Eventually, their plan is to make money from online gambling, sports betting and ads. Well, maybe. But almost everything about Earth Station 5 may be fiction. Perhaps the only certain thing is that, at least for  urlLink The Economist , "it works."  portions of this post taken from  urlLink The Economist    In other news, even Iraqis like Counterstrike  (pictures from LAN cafes in Iraq)

      What to say about the last week... well, let's start with the physical: it's been snowy... and icy... and snowy... and icy....  yeah that's about it... school closures all around, though the roads are still somewhat drivable (I was out all day yesterday, cutting cookies in parking lots and driving up insanely steep, long hills (I’m talking 500 foot elevation changes and 13.5% grade)  4-wheel drive is useful at times…  In related news, all flights to and from PDX (Portland International Airport) have been grounded throughout the day, so the possibility of us getting in the air on time tomorrow is pretty grim. We were considering driving, but my dad’s against that. (Apparently he’s not like Jon Mark’s family who drove 5 hours to a relatives, house… I think grandparent’s, stayed a couple hours, and drove all the way back in the first day of Winter Break – lol)  *edit* he just called the airline and found out that our flight's still scheduled for tomorrow... so that shouldn't be a problem.  Friday – Saturday I had my big slumber LAN party thing. Half of the people thought it was a b-day party and half didn’t so… we got a cake and called it a sorta b-day party. ‘Twas funny. Goody, David, Cam and Matt R. couldn’t come… I was kinda bummed about that. Cam didn’t come ‘cause he didn’t have a ride, Matt didn’t come because he was sick, and I’m still not sure why Goody and David didn’t come. Somehow or other, Goody heard about the party I had for friends from school and stuff and the surrounding three (LOL) sleepovers and I think was bummed that he wasn’t invited. Looking back on it, I really should have invited him, but I was trying to keep the amount of people down at the party, and I was afraid that if I invited even one more person from Calvary, that I was going to have to invite everyone and that would have been something like 60 people from both school and church. Ah well, what’s done is done.  Anyway, the party was great… my tv gave up the ghost a few days ahead of time *stupid piece a’ ....*. Amidst the gaming consoles and general nerd-dom, we had boxing, wrestling, fast paced games of Cranium (wait, we’re heading back into the nerdness, aren’t we…) lol

       urlLink www.naplesnews.com   Royal Phil's concert marked by conductor's solo encore  By PEG GOLDBERG LONGSTRETH, Special to the Daily News  February 13, 2004    Wednesday evening's standing-room-only concert at the Philharmonic Center for the Arts, turned out to be notable, not for the concert, featuring the world renowned Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, but for the encore performance of its highly touted young conductor.   Daniele Gatti, the Royal Philharmonic's music director since 1996 and also the music director at the Teatro Communale in Bologna, returned to the stage following a standing ovation at the conclusion of Beethoven's "Eroica" Symphony to - I thought mistakenly - acknowledge the accolades of the audience.   Instead, this incredibly rude, ill-mannered, churlish, boorish young conductor, tripped over his enormous ego and, in the process, managed to insult and alienate an entire, enthusiastic, respectful audience who had paid nearly $100 a ticket for the evening.  He returned to lecture the audience.   In so doing he confirmed my growing suspicions of his conduct during the evening: Maestro Gatti is a graduate of the Bobby Knight School of Social Diplomacy.   That's right. Gatti, without benefit of a microphone and with a heavy Italian accent, let everyone in the hall know ... know what, exactly? I am going to paraphrase his comments, but I believe he essentially said the following, since others, including Myra Daniels, the president and CEO of the Philharmonic Center for the Arts, with whom I spoke Thursday morning, have confirmed my interpretation of Gatti's comments:  The Royal Philharmonic is an important, world-class orchestra. They have performed all over the world. For the past two weeks they have played nonstop performances. They have never played under such trying circumstances.   Gatti went on:  The Phil's acoustics suck. The stage sucks. The placement of his orchestra on stage sucked.  While trying to make out his comments, I glanced up at Daniels' box, fully expecting to see her stand and fall over the balcony in shock.   I am certain any number of pacemakers in the decidedly older audience  went into overdrive, as person after person reacted with shock.  A number of persons in the audience made the mistake of tittering, not certain what he was saying or why smoke was coming from his ears. He stopped the laughter dead in its tracks, said, "This is no joke. I am very serious," and a hush came over the audience.   His tirade over, he exited, as did, finally, the members of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra who, prior to last evening, had performed here on three other occasions since Gatti's appointment in 1996.   People who had heard right were shocked and outraged. A number of them sought out the ushers to voice their outrage over Gatti's conduct. People stopped me and were calling Thursday morning to ask if I had ever seen anything like that.   One woman called Daniels to comment: "We honored him with applause and a standing ovation, and he told us we were idiots."   Many asked, rightly so, if there were a problem with the acoustics or the stage, what the audience was supposed to do about it?   Indeed.   Reflecting back, I should have known it was going to be a strange evening. There were hints - a portent, as it turns out, of things to come: Gatti failed to utter a simple sentence at the beginning of the concert, informing concertgoers the order of presentation was being switched, which left more than half the audience sitting through the entire first number (which was supposed to be Saint Saen's Cello Concerto) wondering where the cellist was.   In fact, the first hint Gatti was not a happy camper occurred when, at the conclusion of the first movement of the first number, many people in the audience committed a mortal sin: They applauded.   Let's face it. Applause between movements is considered a sign of ignorance and poor breeding by many music snobs. There is nothing unique about music audiences in Naples applauding, as opposed to the rest of the world. They do it everywhere. Even in New York.   OK, so it would be preferable if they hired someone to come out with an applause card, to eliminate any uncertainty about when it is all right to express enthusiasm at a classical concert.   But in the greater scheme of things, given so little to applaud in today's world, is this really worth getting your dander up? Wouldn't you rather they applaud at an inopportune moment rather than boo?   But that wasn't bad enough in Gatti's eyes: At the same time, at the conclusion of that movement, in accordance with the Phil's policy, an usher quietly seated six adults on the far right side of the auditorium. They created no disturbance whatsoever, nor is there anything unusual about such a seating policy.   Gatti chose that precise moment to turn toward them, fix them with his best Bobby Knight stare - you know the look: the one where the general faces you with his best stare, utters not a single word and, in the process, strikes terror in your heart - and waited until they had been seated to proceed with the second movement.   By now, everyone in the hall had turned to see what the "problem" was, when their seating otherwise would not have been noticed by 95 percent of the auditorium.   Believe me, no one applauded during the remainder of movements in the evening's three numbers. Gatti, without ever saying a word or turning to acknowledge the existence of the audience, anticipated the possible applause and shushed them with a hand movement behind his back.   In the midst of all these by now cumulative little signs the maestro was having a bad hair day of monumental proportions, he briefly stopped the performance of Beethoven's "Eroica," turned toward the concertmistress, glowered, and the entire violin section got up and physically closed ranks, moving so close to the edge of the stage, the hapless fifth violinist had to grab his chair as it toppled off the stage.   That said, I am going to sum up the concert by saying it was very good. I am going to tell you the audience was attentive, polite and enthusiastic following the conclusion of each number. I am going to tell you Silvia Chiesa, a passionate young cellist with whom I frankly was unfamiliar, gave a solid performance during the Saint-Saens piece, and I hope we have the opportunity to hear her perform again under less stressful circumstances.   Then I am going to tell you, since so many people have called to ask if I have ever seen anything like what happened last evening, that I have not.   I have seen many gaffes and disasters on stage or during performances in my lifetime:  I have seen children wet themselves during their student recital; a graduate student in voice (whom I was accompanying) suddenly vomit all over everything during her doctoral recital; an organ short out and go totally silent during the procession of an ultra-socialite's wedding. I have seen parts break or fall off instruments. Reeds split. Strings break. Professionals forget their parts and flee the stage. I have seen musicians topple off stage; chairs break; batons suddenly take leave and fly through the air.   But until Wednesday, I have never seen a highly touted, internationally much heralded conductor blow his stack, come back on stage following a standing ovation and berate the audience. Gatti could not be reached for comment on Thursday. In the midst of all this post-concert shock and outrage, I had a sudden epiphany: In the five-plus years since my husband and I relocated to Naples, we always continued to think of Indiana and its musical venues as home.   Wednesday night I became a full-fledged Neapolitan, proud of the wonderful Philharmonic Center for the Arts, proud of the tremendous growth its orchestra has exhibited since we moved here. Thrilled with many of its world-class guest performers, of all the musical riches this community offers. And in the process, I was ready to do battle with this  pretentious, angry little twit who ruined a wonderful evening of music for many of the  concertgoers.   He was unhappy with the setting? It was beneath him?   I don't think he will have to fret about those problems anymore. I doubt there is a snowball's chance in Hell he will ever be invited back.

      The Hoop-A-Thon was interesting... I went, watched Space Jam and ate food. lol  My dad just got my mom a replacement for her aging van - exact same car as mine, down to the year and the color. LOL Buuuut... she's got aluminum rims :) :) I'm stealing those... Oh, and her's might be a V6 rather than a V4, in that case we'd prolly just switch cars... teenagers like acceleration and she drives more than I do and would enjoy the fuel economy.  I'm currently obsessing with  Jimmy Eat World - the Authority Song  and    the Offspring - Amazed    Sometimes I think I'm gonna drown Cause everyone around's so hollow I'm alone Sometimes I think I'm going down But no one makes a sound They follow And I'm alone Yeah if I make it I'd be amazed Just to find tomorrow One more day and I'd be amazed Just to see it waiting And if I make it I'm still alone No more hope for better days But if I could change Then I'd really be amazed And when you know you can't relate To one more shiny face Your heart breaks No one cares And when you know you can't go on Cause everything is wrong Your heart breaks But no one's there

      Listening to:  The Authority Song    It's how the hustle goes, see what the jukebox knows. Put my last quarter on, I play "Authority Song". Honesty or mystery? Tell me I'm not scared anymore. I got no secret purpose, I don't seem obvious do I? I don't seem obvious do I? The DJ never has it, J A M C Automatic. If those were Roy's headphones, you bet he'd play "What Goes On".  Honesty or mystery? Tell me I'm not scared anymore. I got no secret purpose, I don't seem obvious do I? I don't seem obvious do I? Oh I'm here, that means something doesn't it? Oh won't you dance with me a little bit? Oh you don't notice, I guess the music's too loud. It's how the hustle goes, see what the jukebox knows. Put my last quarter on, I play "Authority Song". Honesty or mystery? Tell me I'm not scared anymore. Say anything you want already I'm not scared anymore. Honesty or mystery? Want something else? Just tell me I'm not scared anymore. I got no secret purpose, I don't seem obvious do I? I don't seem obvious do I?   Yesterday, Cam and Andrew left for Vegas. They're going to be gone until the 7th of next month. This sux, I'm gonna be so bored. Ah well I have a ton of h/w to keep me occupied. I'm going to my school tonight for the annual 'Hoop-a-Thon'.. Speaking of which, I'd better get off and take a shower.

      Today was weird... I got up at 6:50, decided to fool myself into thinking I had enough time to take a shower, which I took. then got ready from school, rushed out the door, got my sister to her school just barely on time, and amazingly got to school... no, wait, I was late. School was normal funny weird *blahness* until 1:00 when David Kelly, AT, Zooha, Lenny, Tyler and I all randomly left class early, spent 20 minutes trying to figure out which car(s) everyone was going in, and got on the road, heading toward a Engineering expo / banquet downtown. Holy crap, that ride was crazy... David Kelly drove his own car and everyone else piled into mine. We had decided ahead of time that we were going to be following Kelly, but judging by his driving, that was the last thing he wanted (LOL). Everyone in my car kept screaming and yelling and being generally distracting. The ambient noise levels in my car increased exponentially in parallel with the level of irrationality of David Kelly's driving techniques. In any event, we got there safely.   Apon arrival at the Double Tree Hotel (accross from the Lloyd Center), we discovered that the event was reschedualled to start at 2:45 instead of 2:00 (Darn it, we could have taken the MAX like we wanted to to begin with.) Anyway, after having fun in the glass elevators jacking multiple snack bags from the stash, Lenny and Tyler boarded one bus to go tour Freightliner, and the rest of us boarded the other to go to PSU.   Once we go there, the 60 or so of us all broke off into smaller groups. Zooha and I were fortunate enough to get into the group with like, 7 people. The first place we stopped at was the  STAR Siesmic Lab , the centerpiece of which is a 10' x 10'  Seismic Shake Table . Now this table has got to be one of the sweetest things I've seen in a very long time... it weighs 6? tons, can handle loads of well over 10 tons, and is powered by twin 60 gpm hydralic pumps which give it 3 Gs of acceleration over its travel range of 6 inches. It's amazing (and a little unsettling) looking down into the lab and watching a 13 thousand pound table suddely vibrate 6 inches either direction, more than 5 times a second. Saying you can feel the entire building shake would be an understatment.   The next lab we went to showcased an inverted pendulum, a computer operated device that balances a pendulum upside-down. It was pretty cool; the only method it has to balance it is using a motor to move a cart back and forth along a horizontal track, much like how an inkjet printer works, only a huge amount more precise. It’s interesting, if you knock the pendulum off balance or spin it around, the cart spans back and forth, constantly adjusting until its back up, balanced again. It’s so precise in fact, that it never stopped moving while we were in the room. The professor that was displaying it said that sometimes when he was in the room alone with the door closed, the pendulum would come to a point where it wasn’t moving at all, but then the only thing he had to do was blowing softly at it from across the room to knock it ever so slightly off balance and start it back up again.  After that we toured the spatial design / rapid prototyping labs and finally went outside to check out the  mini baja car  that four graduates had built for their senior project and had entered into a national competition and won first place with. Finally, past 5:00 everyone got back into the bus and headed back to the Double Tree. Once we got back, we perused around the expo for a while. A lot of northwestern engineering colleges were there: OSU (go Beaves’!), OIT, PSU, and many others. I talked to someone at length about an experiment involving micro-gravity that was going to taken up to be studied by way of NASA. (We saw this and head a bit about it back at PSU too). Oh, PSU currently has two other student experiments being tested on the international space station.  AT and David knew ahead of time who their hosts were, so they sat with them for the banquet, but the rest of us didn’t know we needed to know beforehand, so we got adopted into another group (all but Zoo, who went with David). One of the engineers whom we were sitting with does accident reconstruction and a TON of other things. He makes about $250 an hour doing reconstruction work. o.O The other one was an engineer at Freightliner who told us some interesting storied about test-driving though Minnesota (I think…) earlier this year to catch the -20 degree weather.   Dinner was good, but not as good as the to-die-for potatoes and steak at last week’s banquet (or at least that’s what Lenny said). After dinner they introduced the head table and started into the presentations, most of which were about renewable energy etc. The last one was incredibly boring for the first half hour, but then the speaker played a sweet movie about an array of 80 staggeringly  huge  windmills (I’m talking 300’ tall towers, 240’ diameter blade radius) off the coast of Norway (I think...).   Anyway, once that was over, it was getting close to 9:20 and we needed to leave, so by use of ASL, we all communicated to each other across the banquet hall that we were all thinking the same thing and made a hasty exit while they were answering question. (I feel bad, in our rush to get out quickly, Lenny, Tyler and I forgot to thank / say goodbye to our host.)   Holy crap, the drive home was CRAZY. First, it was raining like never before and the vast majority of the time I couldn’t see any type of lane makings. Second, everyone was making massive amounts of noise, and third, my brakes weren’t working properly (I’m getting them replaced tomorrow... *checks his watch* make that later today.) Once we hit Canyon road again, we started blasting techno and everyone in the backseat lost their sanity. I wish I had a video camera with me… AT was making up his own beats and random odd sounds, Tyler was trying to rock the car with his erratic motions and Zoo started screaming and doing other things. ... Yeah that was prolly the best part of the trip. :)  Once I dropped everyone off at their cars at the high school (at 10:10) I came home (carefully, bad brakes remember?) and here I am now, typing this.

      I'm strangely happy. I've been all day today, but more so this afternoon and evening. I think I'm finally starting to come to terms with this whole situation... but then again, I might not be, this might all be me tricking myself ... again.

      Listening to:  Verve - Bittersweet Symphony ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers - Breaking the Girl ,  Jimmy Eat World - If You Don't, Don't  Talking to: Olivia  I have many topics to cover in this post, and I got something like 1½ hours of sleep last night... on my floor, so forgive me if portions don't make much sense.  With that preclude, I'll start with a run-by-run of yesterday and today. After I finished school (½ an hour after my last post) I took Melissa home and headed home myself, intent on swiftly cleaning my room and getting ready for that night. In reality, I got sidetracked, and didn't really start cleaning my room until almost two hours later. Close to 3:00 I started removing some stuff from my old car that I wanted to keep so that my dad could get rid of it later that day (it never actually happened, he's now debating doing something else with it). Anyway, that took a while and then I had to go back inside and mess with my annoying DHCP server to get the office computer (and then later Penguin, my Linux box) back on the net. My mom suddenly came in and informed me that I had under half-an-hour until the Beaverton Florist closed, so I got in the car and made my way over the get the corsage. On my way back I was going to stop at Blockbuster on Nimbus and rent the Hudsucker Proxy for the after-party, but at the intersection before it I realized that it would take me an extra 10 minutes minimum to get it, adding in traffic time, so I turned around and headed back home. Before I got in the shower I called Andrew and told him that I would be picking him up at 5:45 instead of 5:30 like originally planned (since it was like, 5:20 right then and I wasn't even home yet. I got home, jumped in the shower, grabbed the fastest car and flew over to his house... then we took like 20 minutes to get back out the door again. I got back to my house at 6:20 (Cam and Kelli got there at 6:10), ran around the house simultaneously changing into my suit, finding invitations and directions and eating a quick snack. Then we all got in the van and went to Adri's house where we picked her and Melissa up, but not without first stopping for pictures etc.   By this time it was about 7:00, and after some minor confusion about names of highways (it's highway 26 to I217 to the 405 to I5, no wait, it's I217 to highway 26 to, no wait...) we were on our way. Once we got downtown, we passed a parking structure and I was thinking about turning in, but then I decided that it would be safe to keep going and see if it was actually the Hilton the next block (I thought it was, but I wasn't sure). Then we got stuck in the valet parking line (which we should have used... it was $6, not upwards of $30 like we'd been told before. finally I got sick of waiting behind parked (literally) cars and cut into the bus lane momentarily. After that we circled around and ended up parking the place that I was going to park in to begin with, but didn't (lol). Oh, I can't go on without mention the weird on a streetcorner a few blocks from the Hilton, we were stopped at a stoplight and all just kinda watching him... he had stopped a couple in the middle of the sidewalk and kept getting in their way as they tried to pass. We couldn't hear what he was saying, but judging by his elaborate gestures and body movements, he was trying to ask them form something. Then as the light turned green and we drove through the interestection, he randomly ran over the the nearest wall and did a backflip off it. The couple took this opportunity to head off the other direction. (lol)  We got in and checked the time... 7:25 - amazing considering traffic and all the other delays. Exploring we went... looking for ways took kill the half-hour+ until the doors opened. We discovered the 23rd floor has a sweet viewing area, and a couple other people (Emily, Rachael T and others) discovered that there was some type of high class ball in the ballrooms (by crashing it... well, just taking the elevators down and walking through the middle of it, but they called it crashing it :) ). Turned out that we were in the first 10 or so people to arrive.   The doors finally opened at I-don't-know-when and we got out raffle tickets etc. and went in. It was really nice, all elegant and stuff, and a 12 (I think...) person jazz band played. We spent the next almost-2 hours sitting, taking pictures, eating and really really wanting to dance. Oh, in regards to dancing, our school's faculty (um, no, just our Principle ... the teacher wanted to dance too) won't allow it because we "have to be allowing of all denominations" or something... I wondering what group of people outside of the Amish still consider dancing something to be looked down on... It's sooo stupid. /tangent    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      Once we were done sitting, we... stood. …and stood some more. Actually we all went perusing the hotel some more and got our official pictures taken. Close to 11:15, my mom arrived from her concert at *I'll ask her where she was playing, later*.     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      After some confusing about who was taking which car, taking Josh, picking up Steven and getting the movie, my mom left in my car (which she had driven, so knew where it was parked) with Cam, Kelli and Andrew and I left (in her van again, blasting Country music) with Adri, Josh and Melissa. While they were getting the movie, we picked up Steven and we all convened at my house at 11:45. Andrew went downstairs and obsessed with Ninja Guiden and the rest of us started watching the Hudsucker Proxy. Cam and Kelli had to leave at 12-something and Josh left a bit afterward. Andrew came up eventually and finished watching the movie with us. Then, after waking Adri up (lol), Steven, Andrew and I took Adri and Melissa back to Adri's house (at 1:30). I'm not sure of exact times but I thing I fell asleep on my floor at 4:00, woke up again at just before 5, removed my contacts, and drifted in and out of sleep until 9 or 10.   After breakfast, I took Andrew home then went to an eye doctor appointment (with Steven still with me), came back home, made a tiny pizza, took Steven home, and here I am now, typing this.   ____________________________________________________   I approached the thought of the banquette with the idea that the best way to get through it happily was to ignore (i.e. to not think about; pay attention to, not shunning or something) Gwen and Richard, but that had already become impossible before we had even entered the building. Get this: Without my ever having seen his car before, out of all the 1000+ parking spaces in all the garages and all the streets around the Hilton, I managed to park  right beside  them. Heck, if the elevators weren't so small, we'd have prolly taken the same one down. And then I managed to pick one of the one tables directly behind then so any time I looked up at the band (or speakers etc.) I was looking right at them. I realized when I got home that they're also in the background of quite a few of my pictures. Grrr... I just can't get away from it. *feels like... *realizes that he can't 'feel'** Mixed emotions bring me sorrow, to put it lightly.   ____________________________________________________   School is troubling me... It's looking like I'm going to have to scrap my SOS Spanish class 'cause it's getting increasingly difficult to work with (stupid things like giving me a picture of a hideous woman and asking if i think she's beautiful (granted, in Spanish) I answer no and it grades me wrong... and how on earth are you supposed to tell someone's eye color when you can barely tell the color of their hair?? (Yeah I got both of those wrong too). I'm still wondering whether or not I'll be able to go to Vegas too... Even if Char says yes, I'm wondering if it's a good idea to skip an entire week of school.    ____________________________________________________   My family situation's still quite messed up too. Twice in one week has my dad absolutely blown up at my mom again, and once again have the police visited our house. Oh, and now it seems that he finally wants to leave his church because he's fed up with their continued harrassment of my mom (er... go figure...), but he's under the oppinion that he can arbitrarily decided on a new church home and that my mom will want to follow him to it. It's looking a bit more like he's going to give her new one a chance, but I'm not sure. LOL at this point our five person family is divided amoung four different church bodies.  I have a headache... I want wine. (LOL)

      Last week I spent the night at Cam's house... we mostly just sat around, built a huge fire, put it out (LOL), and watched 8 Mile (... still trying to find the plot... there's got to be one...).  Yesterday Bwitty stopped by - lol I didn't reconize her for a second. We talked for five minutes or so and I invited her to my after-party tonight (which I don't really think will be much of a party at all, but oh well.)  Speaking of tonight, tonight's finally WINTER BANQUETTE!! *yay* That should be interesting. I'm picking up Andrew at 5:30, Cam and Kelli are getting to my house at 6:00 and we're picking up Adri and Melissa at 6:15ish. The banquette starts at 8:00 and we'll prolly be ready to head out at 10:00, though actually it might be much later than that... I invited Steven to come over afterward if he wants... have no idea when 'afterward' will be though. The girls have to clear out at 12:30 (which also means Cam since he's going with Kelli) and *... thinks* Andrew, Josh and Steven might stay over night.  I'm getting out of school at 11:30 :) that's a plus right there too.

      Man, I'm having trouble finding time to sit down and get my linux box and affiliated webpage, email, etc. up and running. Heck, I'm having trouble finding time to do anything lately... I need to buckle down and get like, a week's worth of schoolwork done ahead of time too, before the 26th when I'm *hopefully* going to Vegas with Cam and Andrew for 10 days. ... That will be soooo fun if only it would work... My parents are fine with it, but Cam's sister Char (whose house we're going to be staying in, and whose kid Cam's going to be babysitting while we're there) is acting badly about it. I'm kinda confused cause she's fine with another person coming with Cam (Andrew already got the ticket like, two weeks ago), but she seems to be baulking at two people. Kinda annoying since I thought up the idea in the first place. (lol) Whatever...  Winter Banquette's this week... I wonder how that will go... I think I'm having a small party at my house afterward. (Well, I know I am having a party, the only thing about it that I don't know is how 'small' it'll be.

      I went and visited my mom's church,  Beaverton Christian Church  this morning. Last month they handed out 17  thousand  dollars in $10 bills, one to every person in the building. It was a parody of the parable of the talents, everyone was supposed to invest the ten dollars in whatever way they could think of and then turn in the proceeds in three weeks (last week). All the money gained on top of the $17,000 would go to help AIDs victims in Africa. People were very creative, ideas carried out ranged from selling flowers on freeway onramps to opening a sushi bar at school to making collector's mailboxes out of model trains. As of the final count yesterday, they had received $39,395 back, and there's much more coming in. I'm thinking that I might start attending BCC on a regular basis; I'll pray about it and see where God leads...  Oh, btw, this church is by no means small... they can fit more people on their  stage  than Calvary has ever had in their entire auditorium... (LOL)

      You may have noticed that for the last day and a half or so, I've been using  Sideblog  and like it for what it is, which isn't much... There's almost no perceivable user support base, and the free version only allows you to post five posts with no archiving, worse, without informing you, it deletes the oldest post to make way for the newest. Because of this, I lost 7 links without realizing it. Here are the ones left and I'm removing my Sideblog account:   The largest diamond ever discovered  (10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 carats)  Just in time for Valentine's day:  'The science of love'  (Are we "literally addicted to love" or is that just the prairie voles?)

      I can't believe I forgot to write about this yesterday (lol). We had a sex chapel (let's guess... yup) yesterday, and *will insert name when I remember it* from *will insert name of ministry when I remember it* came and spoke. It was ... yeah it just "was" LOL close to the end of the hour and a half, he asked us several questions along the lines on "Show of hands, who here wants to have great sex eventually" or, "Who wants to have sex lots?" LOL it was sooooo funny watching people kinda start to put their hand up then stop, then hold it up again... Don't worry, the entire thing was from a biblical standpoint (um, duh, it's a Christian school...) and it was all geared toward waiting to get married and stuff. ...But it was pretty funny :)

      Well today was good I think... I'm not a very accurate judge anymore. School got out at 1:30 so all the student body and faculty were free to attend a Funeral for Brandon's (a senior) mom. It was really neat, his dad's one of the worship leaders at Harvest (their church), and led worship for the service.  Brandon got up and spoke for a bit; it's amazing how well he's taking it all. He's much stronger than, well, almost anyone I know'd be in his situation.  Afterward, several seniors and I went out to Red Robin for linner ... or dunch... (Why isn't there a word for lunch/dinner, but there's brunch?) They're such a great group of people... wish I could spend more time with them.

      This was given to me by someone who wants to keep his anonymity:   A preacher wanted to raise money for his church and on being told that there was a fortune in horse-racing, decided to purchase one and enter it in the races. However, at the local auction, the going price for a horse was so high that he ended up buying a donkey instead. He figured that since he had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races. To his surprise, the donkey came in third! The next day, the local paper carried this headline: PREACHER'S ASS SHOWS  The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race again, and this time it won. The paper read: PREACHER'S ASS OUT IN FRONT  The bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the preacher not to enter the donkey in another race. The paper headlines read: BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHER'S ASS  This was too much for the bishop, so he ordered the preacher to get rid of the donkey. The preacher decided to give it to a nun in a nearby convent. The paper headline the next day read: NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN.  The bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to get rid of the donkey, so she sold it to a farmer for ten dollars. The next day the paper read: NUN SELLS ASS FOR $10.00  This was too much for the bishop, so he ordered the nun to buy back the donkey and lead it to the plains where it could run wild. The next day the headlines read: NUN ANNOUNCES HER ASS IS WILD AND FREE.  The bishop was buried the next day.

      Listening to:  Joe Satriani - Summer Song  Thinking: How times have changed...  I remember probably the happiest period of time in my life - the start of my 6th grade year and my all the new things it brought. I was so happy my first day of youth group (well, actually I as several other would be 6th graders had been attending for some time, but this was the first day we met at the then-new building, TVJA, and the first time I was technically part of the group. As time went on, I started developing my little nitch there - my friends (of whom Goody was my best), my role (sound guy)... and everything just fit together so happily. Life was pretty much care free back then, sure I had all the issues at home, in some ways better in many ways worse than now, but I didn't pay attention to them, they were just an annoyance that was gradually, without my seeing it, wearing me down.   Now though, everything's different, the only place I feel like I truly belong anymore is school, and not even so much there anymore... now that I'm like a 1.2 GPA student with a learning disability that seems to get me into trouble a lot. My core group of friends has changed to Cameran, Andrew, Steven, d'Dee (lol), Kristy, and assorted others. I've been through a short lived romantic relationship that has its definite plusses and minuses... I go to school again. (LOL, um yeah, I was home schooled for most of my life) I have a car, the lingering need to get a job, all the cares and worries of a teenager (plus some that hopefully the vast majority of us don't have to face), and I'm just generally having trouble coping with life. I have a rather irrational emotional complex that can change on a dime, but never allow me to show it.   I think really the first thing that needs changing to get my out of this rut of depression that I keep falling back into again is a spirit of thankfulness and trust that God is good and looking out for me even when I can't see it. This is tough however, when at times I'm finding myself doubting the very basis of faith that my hope rests on... Does God really exist? Is this all just something we make up to help us get through life, or is it real? These are questions that I struggle with fairly frequently and I really (no matter what it appears on the outside) don't think I've ever answered myself.  Pray for me will yah' guys? I need it, I really have no idea where my life's going right now and it scares me.

      I just ran across an interesting blog called  Hot Abercrombie Chick!  ... um... yeah, despite the name, it belongs to a college freshman (girl), a "probable" philosophy major. In her Feb. 3rd post she has an overview of the whole pro life / choice issue from what seems to be an unbiased standpoint. I haven't read much of her stuff (indeed, not even all of the abortion write up), but what I've seen I like. Most of the people that comment on her site are far left liberals, but I like some of what she herself has to say. Go check it out and tell me what you think.

       The Farewell Dossier  (the world's largest non-nuclear explosion ever to be seen from space was caused by a software trojan)  I copied the article incase anyone reading this doesn't have a  New York Times  subscription   By WILLIAM SAFIRE Published: February 2, 2004  Wahington Intelligence shortcomings, as we see, have a thousand fathers; secret intelligence triumphs are orphans. Here is the unremarked story of "the Farewell dossier": how a C.I.A. campaign of computer sabotage resulting in a huge explosion in Siberia — all engineered by a mild-mannered economist named Gus Weiss — helped us win the cold war.  Weiss worked down the hall from me in the Nixon administration. In early 1974, he wrote a report on Soviet advances in technology through purchasing and copying that led the beleaguered president — détente notwithstanding — to place restrictions on the export of computers and software to the U.S.S.R.  Seven years later, we learned how the K.G.B. responded. I was writing a series of hard-line columns denouncing the financial backing being given Moscow by Germany and Britain for a major natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Europe. That project would give control of European energy supplies to the Communists, as well as generate $8 billion a year to support Soviet computer and satellite research.  President François Mitterrand of France also opposed the gas pipeline. He took President Reagan aside at a conference in Ottawa on July 19, 1981, to reveal that France had recruited a key K.G.B. officer in Moscow Center.   Col. Vladimir Vetrov provided what French intelligence called the Farewell dossier. It contained documents from the K.G.B. Technology Directorate showing how the Soviets were systematically stealing — or secretly buying through third parties — the radar, machine tools and semiconductors to keep the Russians nearly competitive with U.S. military-industrial strength through the 70's. In effect, the U.S. was in an arms race with itself.  Reagan passed this on to William J. Casey, his director of central intelligence, now remembered only for the Iran-contra fiasco. Casey called in Weiss, then working with Thomas C. Reed on the staff of the National Security Council. After studying the list of hundreds of Soviet agents and purchasers (including one cosmonaut) assigned to this penetration in the U.S. and Japan, Weiss counseled against deportation.   Instead, according to Reed — a former Air Force secretary whose fascinating cold war book, "At the Abyss," will be published by Random House next month — Weiss said: "Why not help the Soviets with their shopping? Now that we know what they want, we can help them get it." The catch: computer chips would be designed to pass Soviet quality tests and then to fail in operation.   In our complex disinformation scheme, deliberately flawed designs for stealth technology and space defense sent Russian scientists down paths that wasted time and money.   The technology topping the Soviets' wish list was for computer control systems to automate the operation of the new trans-Siberian gas pipeline. When we turned down their overt purchase order, the K.G.B. sent a covert agent into a Canadian company to steal the software; tipped off by Farewell, we added what geeks call a "Trojan Horse" to the pirated product.   "The pipeline software that was to run the pumps, turbines and valves was programmed to go haywire," writes Reed, "to reset pump speeds and valve settings to produce pressures far beyond those acceptable to the pipeline joints and welds. The result was the most monumental non-nuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space."   Our Norad monitors feared a nuclear detonation, but satellites that would have picked up its electromagnetic pulse were silent. That mystified many in the White House, but "Gus Weiss came down the hall to tell his fellow NSC staffers not to worry. It took him another twenty years to tell me why."   Farewell stayed secret because the blast in June 1982, estimated at three kilotons, took place in the Siberian wilderness, with no casualties known. Nor was the red-faced K.G.B. about to complain publicly about being tricked by bogus technology. But all the software it had stolen for years was suddenly suspect, which stopped or delayed the work of thousands of worried Russian technicians and scientists.   Vetrov was caught and executed in 1983. A year later, Bill Casey ordered the K.G.B. collection network rolled up, closing the Farewell dossier. Gus Weiss died from a fall a few months ago. Now is a time to remember that sometimes our spooks get it right in a big way.

      In computers and the Internet, a geek is a person who is inordinately dedicated to and involved with technology to the point of sometimes not appearing to be normal. As computer technology becomes less frightening to larger numbers of people, society seems to be developing a more tolerant, even benevolent view of the geek. In some circles, it is considered a compliment to be called a geek because the term implies a high level of capability with technology. The term  hacker  used to connote competence more strongly than the term geek, but since media almost always uses the term hacker to mean someone who attempts to break into computer systems (see  cracker ), geek has become a more desirable label. Historically, a geek was a circus person in the sideshow who performed some bizarre feat.   this article was found  here

Archaic. At once; immediately.    Usage Note: An original meaning of presently was “at the present time; currently.” That sense is said to have disappeared from the literary language in the 17th century, but it has survived in popular usage and is widely found nowadays in literate speech and writing. Still, there is a lingering prejudice against this use.

      Music mood:  the Ataris - In This Diary   When I woke up this morning I was so full of emotion... I wanted to write pages to this blog, but now all that's left of my thoughts are a few scattered memories.   School seems so bittersweet now... It's like I don't care at all about grades anymore, prolly because I feel helpless and incompetent. I'll never be good enough, I'll never be good enough. - That’s what I keep telling myself about both my schoolwork and pathetic, lovesick musings. Truth is though, with the new ADD / Dyslexia program that I'm on and support from my parents and most of my teachers, I probably can overcome the schoolwork issues and pull my GPA up from something like 1.1 now to at least a 3.0. Even after that though, the other problem still remains and in truth, for that I really don't think I'll ever be good enough.  Why oh why does this world have to be so cruel? Why do I have to keep torturing myself with all these emotional politics?  Holy crap, I need Cameran there at the banquette with me so I'll have a little support to fall back on... Hope he can come.

      btw, an update on my living conditions at home... I have successfully retrieved the charger for my cell, but I'm keeping it off most of the time so my parents aren't suspisious. I've also completely circumvented the lock on the office door, and have gotten the serial numbers of the keys for both locks so I'll be able to make copies whenever I need to. I've left myself a route of access into my supposedly locked room though I may or may not need to use it as I've convinced my parentals to allow my computer outside of the room, though it remains un-networked, and as such, not connected to the web. I have a plan for circumventing that too, two plans actually, both of which are already starting to go into affect. All I really need right now is a bit of luck and a half hour with the house to myself. I also still have keys to every car except my mom's new one even though my mom thinks I don't have any of them.

      Well, today was interesting... NOT! Nothing happened at all... 'cept for my mom getting mad at my sister for taking a walk with her friend Nicky. They couldn't find her to ask her, so they told me to tell mom where they were if I saw her, which I did when she asked several minutes after they left. When I told her she went to the front door and started yelling my sister's name out it really loudly. Annoyed, she came back inside (they were out of earshot) and when they got home no more than ten mintues later, she pulled my sister downstairs to talk to her,  and when they got done talking, my mom left to a recital (or something) and dragged Nicky along with her to it. I have no idea what that was about... not sure how she has the right to punish SOMEONE ELSE'S CHILD... But hey, I wouldn't be one to understand my mom. (LOL)   Mi madre es loco.

      Yesterday, the long version...   I snuck out of the house around noon and Adri and Steven came and picked me up. We stopped for gas and Adri's mom called (file that information away for later) and then were on our way again. We got to Becky's house a bit afterward (prolly something like 1:00), stayed there for a while, then got a ride to the closest MAX station. We rode that to the zoo, but there Adri's mom called and got mad at her for not calling and telling her when we were leaving Becky's house. Because of this, Adri's mom came and picked her up (go  here  to read Adri's oppinion about that - lol). My mom had gotten home before this, discovered I was gone, and had begun a day-long endevor to call as many people as possible and trash-talk me as much as possible in hopes that it would bring me home faster (F*** you, mom...) Anyway, she had gotten around to Adri's mom, and Adri's mom had kindly offered me a ride home, but I refused it saying that I hadn't come this far just to go back home when my mom told me to (...again).   Anyway, long story short, Becky, Steven and I had a great time at the zoo, though it was close to closing time and I don't think we saw  every single  exibit, but yeah, we had a great time. Afterward, we went further downtown (without paying MAX fare since we were only three stops from Fareless Square - o.O) and ate linner / dunch at Pioneer Place.  We finally headed back to Hillsboro on the MAx and arrived at the end of the line around 7:00. Becky's dad came to pick us up, but informed me that my mom had called and instructed him not to, under any circumstances, give me a ride anywere... That was odd, but whatever. Yeah... anyway, Steven and I just ran the ½-1½ miles to another MAX stop, got on, went to the Fair Grounds, got off, ran another 1000+ feet and met up with them at the Burgerville (lol... I'm still not sure why we went there... oh well, whatever). Anyway, we said goodbye to them and decided to head back. On the way back to Beaverton Transit on the MAX, two random college girls came up to us and started majorly hitting on us... The conversation went something like this:  Them: So, what'cha doing later tonight? Us: Um... going home... Them: Aw come on, it's Saturday night, night before break, let's go have some fun! Us: Um... all last week has been break. Them: Yeah, wait, wha...? how old are you? Us: 17... Them: Serious, no way! (to eachother: ooo, ooo, jail babe!) *We kinda just look at eachother right about now, wonder when they're going to go away* Them: (to eachother again: Well, they're kinda cute anyhow)  This kept going on for a bit, but you get the gist of it...  When we finally got to Beaverton Transit, we boarded a bus heading for my house, had an interesting discussion about the controversial restraunt  Hoooters  with a complete stranger, and finally arrived at the bus stop just over a mile from my house. Steven called him mom, who came and picked him up once we got to my door, and I went inside and greeted... my sisters. Turns out that my mom was gone to a bridal shower and my dad was gone to... something or other else.  Anyway, once my mom and dad both got home, they sat me down and mom listed her punishments for me (My dad had no punishments because in his view, I really didn't do much wrong... just needed some time to get away for a while.)  Punishments are as follows: 1. The doors to my bedroom and the office have locks installed on them, I am not allowed access to them for two weeks, which, in theory, negates the possibility of internet usage. 2. I am not allowed to drive for two weeks, though mom did return my car itself. 3. No activities whatsoever outside of school (this includes extra Calculus help after school...)

      Well, I'm royaly screwed... Long story short, I snuck out of the house today with Steven and Adri and went to Becky's house then the zoo.   My parents changed the locks on my room and the office so I can't use a computer or do anything else normal. They're gone right now and I have no idea what else they have in store for me...  I'll prolly not be posting for a while outside of school, so, as KT says, tootles.  Oh, btw Mandy, if you're reading this, I'm sorry. I wasn't even thinking about prom and all that when all this happened... This was all just too spur-of-the-moment. I probably killed our plans about going, and again, I'm really sorry.

      Crap, my mom is being a huge b*tch. Tomorrow I'm spending the day on the town, going to the zoo among other things with Becky, Mandy, Adri and Steven. This is all well and good except for a counseling appointment that my mom had made a while back (without telling me) for 4:00 tomorrow. When she brought it to my attention, I immediately knew that it was going to need to cancel it since it simply would not fit into the schedule for tomorrow, but when I asked her to do it (since she made the appointment herself) she wouldn't hear of it. So, I did the responsible thing and called my counselor and canceled the appointment myself. We were both fine with it but... about half an hour ago, mom asked me if I'd skewed my schedule to make room for the appointment yet, and I was about to lie to her just to get out of having to explain it all over to her, but I didn't and told her that I'd canceled it myself. She was furious and decided to punish me by giving me FOUR F***ING HOURS OF HOMEWORK to do before I go tomorrow morning... AFTER SHE SAID THAT NO MATTER WHAT, I WOULD GET ALL DAY OFF TOMORROW!  Oh my gosh, she's sooo....  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!.....  *restrains himself from blowing up or shooting something*  But wait, there's more... She originally wanted me to meet her at Costco tomorrow morning at 10 to pick up my glasses then go with her to the library to get some books for my English term paper (why she has to be there for me to do that, I don't know...), but then we decided that I would just park my car at the grocery store across from Steven's house so we wouldn't have to take both vehicles all over... I'm realizing that that's a very bad thing now because she's now going to try to check my work to make sure it's done, and won't let me go if it's not...  As I said to Steven moments ago: "well, one way I get literally no sleep, another way we start out at like, 3pm instead of 11am (and Adri has to be back home by 5), and another way, the day goes fine, 'cept for my parents harassing me by calling me constantly, and I wouldn't but it past them to come to the zoo since they already know I'm going to be there... then life'll be hell for a while at home... LOL Screw my mom and her stupid control issues."

      If you don't already have this song, get it. I love it, it's beautiful.    Incubus - I Miss You    To see you when I wake up, is a gift I didn't think could be real. To know that you feel the same, as I do, is a Three-fold utopian dream. You do something to me  That I can't explain.  So would I be out of line, if I said  I miss you? I see your picture; I smell your skin on, the empty pillow next to mine. You have only been gone ten days, but already I am wasting away. I know I'll see you again  Whether far or soon. But I need you to know, that I care  And I miss you.

      I just found out that Gwen's going to have to put Rascal, her dog to sleep  tomorrow ... Prayer would be appeciated about  this, I know it's going to be really tough on her.   Update (Thursday, March 25th): I just recieved a voicemail from her from last night saying they're keeping Rascal a bit longer.  *happyness* :)

      Ok, about last week... *goes back and finally edits the Sunday March 14, 9:06:05 AM post*  Concerning the last three days:  *after typing this, he got a call that the salmon that his dad's been BBQing was ready, so he ran upstairs, ate it, and came back down to finish this*  Friday was like any other day really except that we were on EOD (End Of Day) schedule for a talent show.  The talent show lineup (as best can be remembered by Armaan): 1. Josh R playing piano 2. Alex sticking his hand in his mouth, putting both legs behind his head, making himself sneeze with a Q-tip  up his nose  and licking his elbow (holy crap) 3. Carissa (spl?) playing piano 4. Megan, Patrick and Brandon playing / singing *doesn't remember* 5. Jen, Gwen and Adri singing  Into the West by Annie Lennox  (all looking cute and sounding wonderful, I might add) 6. Derek and Joel tearing up the stage with a sweet sweet sweet bass / drum duet (they are so friggin' good) 8. Megan and Ali singing  Goodbye to You by Michelle Branch  9. Andrew and David singing an ode to the word "sick"  After this, I said goodbye to everyone for spring break and went back home to collect my computer etc. to set up at Jon-Mark's house for the big all-night LAN party. Now that party was fun... total geeks hanging around each other, having a good time. In attendance were Jon-Mark, Deren (duh and duh), Ryan, Ryan, Brian, Zoo, *someone else that had to leave early, and consequently, I didn't catch his name* and myself. StarCraft all around... I brought food... Wired, Henry Winehard's Cream Soda, chips, and  3 pounds  of Reese's Pieces (lol) Man, we need to have another of those really soon, I wanna hang around those guys more often... so funny :) LOL, One of the Ryans can bend so far backward that he can remove his glasses with his feet! It's great.   I took some video with my camera... will put it up on the web as soon as I pull it off... I'll prolly pull some pics off it too... Speaking of pics, I have a background changer that changes my background picture every so often, and it happened to be on this really cute picture of Gwen and Danie from the banquette. One of the guys saw it and was like "Oh my gosh, they're hot" so I turned off the background changer and it's still my desktop right now (LOL)  Zoo is soo crazy at Starcraft... he creamed every single one of us even when the remaining four (after several had been annihilated) allied and worked against him.  LOLOL We actually had so much load on the lines that we killed the power to most of the lower floor of his house around 10am Sat... We never did figure out what the problem was though we're thinking it might be a GFI somewhere that we couldn't find. Hope they get that fixed.  Anyway, I finally left at 12:40 on Saturday and Steven & Becky called me as soon as I got in the car... Looking back on that I'm quite glad they did... kept me from falling asleep on the way home. LOL, I wonder how that conversation went... I was so tired I don't remember any of it, and I doubt I made much sense to them either. :)  Later that night, after I got 3 or so hours of sleep, I picked up Steven, drove Beaverton Transit Station and we took the MAX out to Portland where the Columbia Symphony was having a concert. There were only two pieces, a symphony and a masse, but they were each about an hour long. I don't get how my mom can play for two hours straight... Id' get so tired (lol). The masse was cool. Aside from the orchestra, it involved a 200 person (it looked like that many, maybe I'm remembering wrong...) choir, four soloists, and the pipe organ in the sanctuary that it was performed in (which is actually two pipe organs, one on the back wall, and one on the front).  Afterward, we all went to a really nice bar for a while that a lot of the orchestra members go to afterwards and finally succeeded in getting a hold of Becky (we’d been trying to call her but the line was busy, then we got on aim from my phone but she wasn’t on, so we just waited and called a couple more times). We left and went back to my car because the restaurant section of the bar was too expensive (go figure…). After driving around for another hour trying to find some place that was open (it was past 11), Steven and I went to a local Sherri’s and had dinner.   After I took him back home and got back home myself, I tried to get to bed and get to sleep but I was too restless to do so… I finally got to sleep after 7am (LOL) and woke up today at 5:30pm (wow, my body clock is going to be messed up because of all this) and I’m meeting my uncle to do something tomorrow at 10am so I need to get to bed at a decent time tonight… erk

      I'm sure everything's heading downhill from here, but at the moment I feel quite good. Maybe it's cause I'm all warm and comfy in a bathrode - Wikiki day at school so I'm wearing swim trunks, a hawaii shirt, sandals and a towel. Understandably, I'm bringing a change of clothes though since it's predicted that it'll be cloudy and cold all day. Whatever...  My hand's starting to heal up... I drove myself yesterday. Speaking of driving, it's funny how many people from school I meet on the road on the way to school... at the intersection of 229th and TV highway yesterday, Gwen and her dad were the first stopped (in his spiffy new X5), then Rachael Z. and her mom, then me, then Brent freezing his butt off cause his mom had said that it would be a nice day... He took that to mean that the morning would be nice too so he lowered the top on his Wrangler (lol).

      I have a  massive  headache and my hand and srm still hurt... life sux, though today's comfortable day at school so i'm wearing a soft jogging suit and bathrobe. That sorta helps cheer life up. O, and I drove my car home from Melissa's house yesterday after helping her and Danie with a movie for spanish. ...That was a mistake. Er, no, not helping them, driving... My hand was all messed up again afterward, so today I got a ride with Adri. May be a couple days yet before I can drive again.

      Hey I did finally end up going to Melissa and YoungHee's party, but while there I had an encounter with a rose bush that left my right arm / hand useless for the time being. Because of this I'm not going to write the long and envolved post about it that I was going to, but'll save it for later.   Wow, I type so much slower with just my left hand (LOL)  *added Sunday March 21st*  Yeah about that party... I did more schoolwork in the 24 hours before it that I'd ever thought possible because my mom wouldn't let me go unless a certain amount of back work was done. ...That was crazy... well, so was how much I drove in the hour before the party: It started at three and I left the house at 1:55... 'Drove to the Beaverton/Tigard border, bought gifts, drove to Steven's house a bit deeper into Beaverton, drove all the way around inot greater Beaverton (Farmington area and such) to avoid a huge traffic jam that I'd seen before... drove  all  the way into Hillsboro to pick up Cam, stayed a bit the wrap presents and watch part of a movie (?!? lol) then brove back to Aloha to arive at Melissa's house at just after 3:10.  Certain parties whose names I will not mention made the whole thing more of a pain than it already was by continously cracking sick jokes and egging eachother on... That was really annoying. Cam, Melissa, Jen and I finally went outside to get away from it, and finally locked ourselves (minus Jen, I think) in my car. That sorta backfired because the people we were trying to get away from followed us outside but we decided to to protest because now they weren't inside and everyone could go back to watching to movie or whatever it was they were trying to do...  Finally after a while, we succeded in getting just Cam, Melissa, *will insert name of Melissa's friend when I ask Melissa what it is later...* and I in the car by ourselves and drove off for a while.  A bit after that, I turned my car around so the back was facing the basketball hoop and started playing music... That was fun, we just hung out outside doing whatever for a while.  Then, after the sickness had finally died down, I went back inside to watch everyone play Dance Dance Revolution on someone's Playstation2. That was pretty funny.  After all this came my expirience with the rosebush... that was when almost everyone was leaving so I didn't miss out on much because of it (lol) You know, looking back on it from over a week later, I'm realizing that that was the only reason Gwen talked to me that night so I guess I should be thankful for it in some weird was... (LOL)  Speaking of Gwen, let's talk about social networking at the party and such: First and formost, YoungHee's bro. apparently goes to TVJA and from that YoungHee knows Jeff, whom she brought over to do some magic tricks... Now, Cam, Andrew (who wasn't there, but has been at almost every other activity) and I had always been somehow led to believe that Jeff was someone to shy away from and because of such, never relaly talked to him. But now, in the closer envirionment of the party, he seemed like someone interesting to get to know. The second person whom I know almost nothing about is Richard: When we came, Jen, Gwen and Adri were hunkered away in Melissa's room practicing a song that they sang on Friday, so I got a chance to talk to Richard a bit, not long mind you though because the girls got out of the room almost immediately after we got there... From then on, Richard and Gwen were pretty seclusive, mostly cuddling and spending time in rooms apart from where everyone else was... I think that's in part the fault of the two people that were annoying everyone else that I talked about earlier. Oh well, I don't know what to make of it. Sux for me (LOL) but that's life.

      Current mood: sad / depressed / whatever  It doesn't look like I'm going to be able to go to Melissa and YoungHee's party on Sat, and, in consequnece, not going be able to provide rides for Steven and Cam to it. GRRRRRR..... I've got such a mountain of continually backed up schoolwork that keeps gettign added to every day. I can't cope with this... I feel like just taking a break from sanity for a while. Anyone wanna come with me? (lol)  In other news, it's about 2,614 steps from Josh M's front door to my front door. I know this because I was bored, so I ran to his house and back earlier tonight. Took a bit, but was refreshing.  HBOK my life pisses me off... actually, my life depresses me, what pisses me off is my lack of ability to do anything about my life slowly deteriorating before my eyes.

      Well, I'm at school now, so I guess this is 'further notice' (lol). My parents and I met with the very understanding school board last night, who gave me a 20 demerit extention.  In other news, I've collected such a huge amount of detention / suspensioin slips this year that I'm building one or even two REG devices (you all remember what those are, right?) out of them. My Chem. teacher laughed when I told him.

      Listening to:  Kenny G. - Titanic (Instrumental)   Well, I had a good day today... I've been suspended until further notice (which will hopefully be deliberated tonight) for having 100 demerits. My school uses a system of demerits where you get five for a minor offence (every time you get a detention you get a minimum of five demerits). I accumulated a massive amount of detentions to the first semester simply for being tardy because it takes so long to drop off my sister before school. Tardies reset every quarter, and when they do you get two free ones and 4 possibilities to be excused by parents. Every tardy after that is a detention of increasing length and finally at the sixth tardy you get ISS (In-School-Suspension). At the third one you're automatically up for expulsion from the school. Btw, there are two different running tallies of tardies, one for first period and one for all the rest of the periods, so it's different being late for school than being late in between classes.  First semester we (the faculty and I) realized there was a problem when I'd accumulated 16 first-period tardies... that's on top of the ... 10 or so that had been excused. LOL  In any event, I came into this quarter with a ton of demerits and only made that worse by being tardy many times again and by forgetting to serve detentions (an extra detention and 20 demerits). So, yeah... In any event, The school board's holding a special meeting tonight to discuss what to do about me since by our school's bylaws the principle has to recommend to the board, dismissal of anyone that gets 100 demerits. I'm not sure what's going to happen but I do know that the only one who seems outright against me is the principle... everyone one else has an attitude of 'how can the school help you?'  Whatever... that's what's going on in my life right now.  Oh, I maintain that today was good :) pretty carefree, everyone was gone so I had the entire day to be lazy, sleep in and do some work around the house. ... The first non-stressful day in a good while.

      For the first time in a quite a while, I went to youthgroup tonight. 'Brought Adri with me too. Man, I was so down the whole night... A couple times I was almost crying. I don't know really what it was... No, I take that back, I know exactly what it was... Standing there singing, sitting there listening to the message, I couldn't quite keep my attention on what was happening around me. Mind wandering, thoughts drifting, faded memories coming back again to haunt my mind: I'm starting to think I really don't have a place anymore... Everything at church seems so vague, so foreign now, everything at school seems like wishful memories or weeping past, everything at home seems well, horrible. Everywhere I turn I'm reminded of something I'm trying to let go of, was trying to let go of. Then I begin to retrace my steps and realize that I shouldn't be trying to let go of it at all... Or should I? It's been almost eight months now and I still can't figure it out.  What's best for her?  What's best for me?  ...  God, why can't I just tell her how much I'm in love with her?  *cries himself to sleep*

      I'm pissed at my parents... On Monday my mom had told me to get to bed at 10:30, which I did. I couldn't sleep because I'm not used to trying to that early, and close to 11:45 I got up to get a drink. She arrived home, accused me of disobeying her (what the he... such a huge offence...) and then accused me of lying to her when I tried to convince her otherwise. Whatever... I just went back to bed and forgot about it, but then the next night she was out again, and sometime around 9:50 my dad was like, "Why aren't you in bed?" I just kinda  stared blankly at him and was like "wha...?!?" I learned that apparently as a punishment for not being in bed 'on time' on Monday I was supposed to go to be at the hideous time of 9:30 on Tuesday. My mom thought that my dad had told me and my dad had thought that my mom had. It gets even better though... My stupid stupid mom didn't care that it was infact my dad's fault, she decided to punish me for the 'offence'  again  on Wednesday by making me go to bed again at 9:30.  Now on Wed. I don't normally even get home untill past 6:30 and yesterday, my dad had to run a couple errands so I didn't get home untill past 7. I flat out told her that I wouldn't have enough time no matter how she sliced it and that I was not going to go to bed at 9:30. Oh, by the way, we're having a blood drive today at school and I signed up for it assuming my parents would be perfectly fine with it. I mentioned it to my dad, who didn't care, and again to my mom when I got home, right before I told her that I wasn't going to be able to get to bed on time. She mentioned that she had some concern about me being constantly fatigued and that it might make it worse if I were to give blood, but then had to run out the door to catch a movie with some friends.  I called her sometime after 9:30 to address the concerns that she had because I was getting ready for bed, but she steered the conversation to why I wasn't already in bed, not some health issues she might have with me donating blood. I was really hurt by that because it says to me that she cares more about her rules that she impetuously lays down than for me, her son's health. We ended up in an argument which consisted of me almost pleading with her to hear me out, but finally after she cut me off the umpteenth time and said no, I hung up on her. I know, I know, that was a bad thing to do and I already appologized to her. Regaining my composure in a matter of seconds, I kept from crying and went upstairs to my dad's room and right as I knocked on his door, my mom called him. She started telling him her side of the story and before I could get a word in edge-wise, he started doing to her what she had just before been doing to me: abruptly steering the conversation to another topic and blaming it all on her. He started on his whole partyline about how she was a horrible wife and mother and she should be home helping us kids with homework and such (btw, she pours countless hours into doing stuff like that, he just never takes the time to think through his name-calling, yelling tantrums) Anyway, he ended up hanging up on her too, but for a much different reason than I did.   Now would be a good time to clarify that my family's disfunctional.   Anyway, this morning I talked to my mom for a good twenty minutes about the blood donation thing, and she still is stubbornly sticking to punishing me for something that I didn't do and then wasn't informed that I 'did' by not letting me help save a life. Brilliant mom, just brilliant.

         Pictures will take a long time to load, please be patient     Today was awesome! I'll append this post with a fairly long approximation of the day, but it'll take a bit to write, so sit tight.  In the mean time, pictures have been uploaded to  http://members.lycos.co.uk/ccbyg    Painting etc...   On the way over to the Cornelius Community Baptist, I called Cam who had just woken up and invited him to come with me, but he unfortunately he couldn't. Once I got there, I checked the first room (which will become the worship room, but I didn't know that yet), then had a bit of trouble getting into the second room - one of the doors was locked and the other was blocked closed ... I called Mary who didn't answer then it dawned on me to knock. (lol) I did, the door opened and in the room painting were Mary, Jamie, Danie, Jon, Lenny and Alex.  Right after I got there, we switched back to the other room because we'd ran out of red paint for the moment and Over the next hour or so I learned why we were getting the rooms ready to be used - Mary and Lenny have basically taken it upon themselves to start a youth group. I'm pretty excited about it, we've already gotten a lot of it planned out and we're working on the rest - pretty good for an idea that was though up last week. (lol)  At some point Lenny, Jamie and I went out to get some more red paint and met Melissa coming in as we were leaving to go to Ace Hardware. She had her camera with us and all the pictures I'm going to post were taken by it. Speaking of pictures, a while after we got back, Lenny went out and got pizza, and we took a break to eat and take these pictures: (hover your mouse over all the pictures in the post for title)                             btw, the piece of wood that Lenny's hanging off of in "the Lenny Scale" is a broken tire swing. - This happens to currently be my background.    We went back inside and continued painting. Lenny could have almost been on a first-name basis with the employees of Ace for the number of times he had to go back there, but we finally got the rooms looking perhaps not we had planned, but good anyways. Here are some pics of us painting the to-be Game Room:                                        We were originally going to paint these three sides of this room red and one side light green (color of the other room) and then use the green to make the red a plaid, but we eventually decided to go with that blue for one wall and continue using red for the other three. The last paint trip Lenny took, Ace got the shade of red a bit off, so after we touched up the wall, we realized that we could clearly see the difference between the old red and the new. We decided to use handprints to draw attention away from the errors on the wall and it worked out quite nicely. The last picture here is the Worship Room and some stuff that's been donated to our fledgling youth group.               After we were finally done for the day, we sorta lounged around while Abby and Jamie washed all the stuff off. Our excuse was that there was only one sink, but in reality, we did do almost as much work as them, cleaning up upstairs, we were just done faster. (lol)               For some reason Abby and Jamie started running around outside, pretending to fight and Lenny ran after snapping pictures. It went on for like ten minutes - was pretty funny.               Once we had locked up, we went back around the front, signed each other’s already-painted shirts and took a group picture.             We left and went to Izzy's where Mary's dad was treating us to dinner... On the way there Becky called me and I invited her to come to the youth group when we start it. At one point I noticed Lenny's car ahead of me and to the left, signaling and people waving at me from inside. Eventually I figured out that they wanted me to fall into the lane behind then, and puzzled, I did so knowing full well that both out lanes were turning ahead and that the one I was in would have been faster. I was on the phone though and didn't feel like making a mistake and having to turn around if for some reason I was remembering the road wrong. (lol)  Once we got to Izzy's we were pretty loud and obnoxious. (I think anyway - lol) Oh, and we were REALLY slap-happy - made for a strange time.                                   Yeah, that was a really fun day...

      You know, there are words in geekdom, like in any other area that are taken from their original meaning and changed slightly to better facilitate release into the populous.  Words in question: Gigabyte and Hacker  LOL, I have no idea why I'm posting about this, but here goes...  First, gigabyte... having a little background on the root of the word helps to understand the problem: Computers are at the very basic, a huge, huge compilation of switches that can either be on or off, we call this base 2 (because there are only two positions that they can be in) or binary. In binary a 1 is on and a 0 is off. That's how a computer stores information, in a sequence of 1s and 0s. One space that can be occupied by either a 1 or a 0 is called a bit. A sequence of eight of these is called a byte. For reasons I won't go into here, eight just happens to be the 'magic number' of 1s and 0s that we use to communicate a standard sequence of information (like a number or letter... capital A is 01000001 in binary, lowercase a is 01100001).   The problem lies in societies' grasp of numbers, just as ancient societies used base 6 in mathematics (that's where 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour and other things like 360 degrees in a circle came from - all multiples of 6), so does our society use a base 10 system - all our mathematics are rooted in multiples of 10. Not so with binary, which we've already established, is base 2. Everything involving information storage in computers is figured in multiples of 2 - 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, etc. As computers advance, more and more storage space is needed bigger and bigger numbers are need to describe that larger space... First bit, then byte, which is eight bits, the a Kilobyte, which is 1024 bytes, then a Megabyte, which is 1024 Kilobytes, then Gigabyte, which is 1024 Megabytes. Now, let's stop and think about this for a minute... A Gigabyte is 8 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 bits... that's 8,589,934,592 ones and zeros... pretty impressive huh?  Now again, back to the problem... societies' changing of a word from its orrignal meaning to something that's better understood by the populous. Our culture is based upon everything conforming to us, us sitting back and just letting it all fall into place. Case in point: tech people are starting to realize that the average non-tech person (who I call the layman)  for some reason can't figure out that a standard like Gigabyte  can  mean exaclty 1024 smaller units, not just simply 1000. Because of this, they've adopted to calling 1000 Megabytes a Gigabyte, not 1024. This is apparent in everything from gmail (check the screenshot from the last post) to labels on hard drives. Now in the case of gmail, this doesn't seem that big, superficially it's only a loss of 201326592 bits (translates to 24 Megabytes), but consider the 200 Gigabyte hard drive that one of my friends bought a few months ago... Imagine if the makers had employed this "layman's gigabyte" but instead counted  every  multiple as simply 1000 not 1024... *grabs his calculator*   Now,  8 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 200 = 1717986918400 8 x 1000 x 1000 x 1000 x 200 = 1600000000000  The former subtracted by the latter is 117986918400 bits That divided by 8 is 14748364800 bytes That divided by 1024 is 14402700 kilobytes That divided by 1024 is 14065.13671875 megabyes That divided by 1024 is 13.735485076904296875 gigabytes  So what have we seen here? Societies' stuborn inability to grasp even slightly foreign concepts has cheated my friend out of   over 13 Gigabytes  .  Secondly, the word hacker... *looks at the clock* ... I'll append this post later.

       Saturday: Prom Night…   I don’t remember what time I actually got out of bed on Sat. but I think it was just past noon. My sister was at an all-nighter with her youth group and got back home around 2, by this time I’d already showered and gotten my suit and everything basically ready. My sister needed a ride to my school at 3 for a fair so I took her over and stuck around for a bit to make sure some of her friends were there, then came back home.   I had eaten (my first meal of the day – lol) and gotten ready to go pick up Steven at 4pm, but Mahdi randomly showed up at our door. Now, a little background on Mahdi: We met him at the ethnic excuse-for-a church we attended almost all my life (well, actually we helped start it) until a couple years ago. He’s got some mental issues going on and my dad’s been trying to help him but Mahdi’s been getting into a lot of trouble with the police and other people lately. Like a week or so ago he randomly left his van in our driveway, with a brief note written to my dad, stuck on our door that said that his roommate had been giving him trouble. That was all. (Btw, he still has studs on his tires, several weeks after the latest date he can legally have them on.) Yeah, so anyway, he randomly showed up on our doorstep and started knocking on the door for something like six to ten minutes straight. I was the only one home and just ignored him; didn’t let him know I was there. I was sitting in the kitchen eating and a thought occurred to me… He’s persistent enough; he might come up on the deck. I though for sure that he wouldn’t but there still was a possibility, and I needed to do something in my room anyway, so I took my food (leftovers from Wu’s Open Kitchen) and went down to my room to finish eating it. Almost the second I walked into my room, I heard Mahdi walking up the steps to the second story deck, right where I was moments ago. I called my dad and asked him if he’d told Mahdi that he could come over and he told me just the opposite… that he had told him specifically  not  to come. Yeah, I waited like twenty minutes and went back upstairs again (with a gun on my belt) and saw that he had gone and taken his van, but he left a 20 thousand dollar silk Persian rug on top of our cathouse outside… Yeah whatever, odd fellow.  Anyway, because of this I was close to half an hour late picking up Steven. On the way to Becky’s we picked up a camera from Cam’s house because my dad had mine and I hadn’t seen my parents in two days so I couldn’t get it from him. (Weird schedules where everyone’s asleep when I get home and everyone’s gone when I wake – lol)  We finally arrived at Becky’s at 5:30 instead of 5:00 like we had planned, but ‘twas all good ‘cause Danie and Jon arrived just after us too. Mary and Mandy were busy doing Becky’s hair so Danie, Jon, Steven, Edwin and I picked prolly the oddest of the … several hundred or so VHSs there – “Yomega Yo Zone” lol, It was a yo-yo infomercial type thing that we guessed and later confirmed, came with a yo-yo. Then came hanging around waiting for food to cook, eating and changing. (lol) I forgot a belt so I had to borrow one from Becky’s mom. After that were couple and group pictures and driving to the random ballroom in Portland: Steven, Becky, Edwin and Mary in Becky’s mom’s car, and Danie, Jon, Mandy and I in Mandy’s mom’s.  Once we got there just after it started at 8, one of the first things I noticed was the candy buffet on several huge tables in the first room, there were massive (I’m talking like two cubic feet+) bowls of Skittles, M&Ms and other things. When we got to the dance floor we hung back for a bit for some reason and then decided to start right as the slow songs started. (lol) Slow dancing was kinda scary but fun – sorta weird to do it with someone who’s just a friend, but yeah, ‘twas fun. Then the at the first fast song, Baby Got Back, Steven and I were like “Uh, we’re not dancing to this…” which was all good ‘cause our dates picked that moments to run off with each other, so we went back to our table (LOL). The rest of the next hour or two was spent dancing again, but up in the back of the higher of the two-tiered stage. “Cotton Eye Joe” came on and all 70 or so of us up there started a massive line dance. So great… haha. But yeah, I think eventually the six of us in our group that were up there got tired of the ear-shattering loudness and the heat, even though there was an industrial fan blowing on stage (girls randomly lifting their dressed in front of it… or maybe by it… whatever) and went back to our table. More walking and picture taking for half an hour and then we finally organized everyone and got group and couple shots. The group shot was interesting, the photographer was trying to fit four of us on a really tiny bench, and eventually just had Mandy and Becky sit on Steven’s and my leg. Seemed really uncomfortable for the poor girls, they were almost falling off (lol, but the picture turned out good, so *yay*).  Around 11:30, when it officially ended, we all walked outside and waited for the moms to walk back from wherever it was that they were. They ended up needing to use the restroom so we waited some more, and while we were, some self-proclaimed pervert walked up and started asking us to all pose for a picture. (lol) He kept commenting about Becky’s hair then after her took the picture some random lady with him started asking us what our addresses were and if we wanted copies of the picture. We’re all like “Um, you said you’re a perv, go away” then once the moms got back down we went next door to the parking garage and some random college guys started hitting on the girls and walked around a corner out of sight. When our elevator opened, we realized it was glass and they were hanging around the outside. To bad for them, all the girl’s dressed were floor-length, though Edwin was going to moon them… (LOL)   Sunday: The after-party, Cam’s house, and hearing Mr. Weber preach   We made it to Sherri's ordered our food, ate, and tried many different inventive ways of asking for the check when we realized that it was past 2am, more than two hours from when we’d arrived (LOL) - They were way understaffed. Poor waitress though, she was running around like mad.  When we arrived back at Becky’s house, Steven and I went inside and grabbed our stuff and everyone else took off to take other people home.   …*sigh* That was a really fun night despite the hotness and cramped-ness of the ballroom. For the record, I think my date (Mandy) looked beautiful and am really happy she invited me.  Side not: I saw a friend Hannah that I hadn't seen in... prolly more than 7 years... she got a picture with me but I forgot to get ond with her... should somehow get in touch with her and have her email it to me or something... Speaking of pictures, I'm prolly going to wait till I have some better pics (prolly scan of other people's and scans of the professional pics) before I post any... I don't have the camera with me and I didn't like the pictures I took.  I spent the next hour or so on the road taking Steven home, going home myself to get a belt (lol) and arriving at Cam’s house past 3:30am.  The first thing I noticed when I got to Cam’s house was the silhouette of someone with an AEG automatic weapon aimed out his window at my car, and the second thing I noticed was the automatic weapon firing rounds at my car … with very very good aim (or bad aim, depending on what he was aiming for… I’m assuming he was trying to hit  near  my car, but not actually  hit  my car. My only means of defense was my ½ million candle power spotlight, so a standoff was reached; every time they’d shoot at me, I’d blind them and every time I blinded them, they’d shoot at me (LOL) This only ended when Andrew called me and I told him to send Cam out to help my carry my bags up (lol).  We didn’t really do much, just talked till 5am then fell asleep. Cam woke me up at 9:45 but I didn’t actually get up until 10:15, right as Adri called me to see if I was coming to a tiny Baptist church three blocks from Becky’s house where Mr. Weber was preaching. He had told us last week that he was going to preach there and had tried to get as many people to come with him because the church was full of old people (LOL). So, we did and we highschoolers outnumbered the regulars two to one. When Weber was done preaching he called the 60+ year old “Frank No-So-Hotra” (LOL!!) up to give an announcement. Everyone applauded in hilarious agreement though when Weber proclaimed that Frank actually was hot. Man that guy’s so funny.  Later, I went back to Becky’s house to return her mom’s belt. (lol) Before I knocked or rang the doorbell Becky opened it and our entire converstation went as follows:  Her: Don’t *muffled, but it sounded close to “ring the doorbell”*. Me: Don’t ring the doorbell? Her: Yeah my mom’s sleeping. Me: Ok, see ‘yah. Her: Bye.

I'm starting to think about looking into medication and other stuff... not sure where that'll go though. Life's been good the last couple of days like I said, despite being grounded, but for some reason right after lunch today I got really down again and have been ever since.   Whatever...

      Woot, I'm finally posting from my spiffy laptop hidden away in some remote corner of my house (My parents don't even know I have it ;) ). Yeah, anyway, the last couple days have been dandy for me...   Note:  All that stuff that I said about my mom, well I'm leaving it... I kinda have a policy here on my blog that once I post something, it stays 'cause that's how I felt when I wrote it and the whole purpose of a blog is kinda destroyed once one goes back and starts editing previous posts to conform them to their current frame of mind. Anyway, with that said and with the assurance that my mom and I are back on friendly terms again (We've fully discussed the incident(s) and have come to the conclusion that if given the chance to re-live them, we'd have done stuff differently), I'll go back to the part about the last couple days being dandy...   I got to drive my car again for the first time on Sunday! *Woot again!* I kinda ...erm, left early and went to Goodwill where I was extremely happy to find a connector for this laptop, the only part infact that has been preventing me from getting it on the web. Btw, I forget the processor speed, but it has 12Mb of RAM, a 154Mb HD, and a 640x480 display running at 256 colors. LOLOL Beastie machine huh? I can't believe it actually runs Trillian... and IE at the same time! Anyway, I finally got over to Calvary, stayed a while, saw Bwitty (that's always cool - she's fun to hang around), and finally saw Cam after almost two weeks... Man I was going through Cam-withdrawal (LOL) He was doing good, but now there's some stuff going on that's really screwing with him so... yeah sux.  Anyway, on Monday, I couldn't believe it; Gwen gave the message for Opening (our Monday morning chapel). I'm proud of her... that takes guts. It was about depression and conquering it through happiness in God's love... exactly the type of struggle I'm going through right now... and have been for the last two years infact. Yeah... Monday was awesome after that.  Today I got out of an entire day of school ('cept the last ten minutes of my last class) because we had an all-day field trip to the state capital, Salem. That was cool... during our trip to the actual capital building, they had an earthquake drill. That was pretty stupid; we didn't even know what it was... I was sliding down one of the huge marble ramp things on either side of the two flights of stairs (LOL, intended as decoration, not actually to slide down, though even out elderly tour guide admitted to having done so herself at one point..... HAHAHA), and some guy walked into the rotunda and blasted a blowhorn siren. We were all like 'um... wha..?' Yeah that was fun.  I've got a huge report for Spanish due... um today (hehe) that I'm having a very hard time completing... I don't get it, I have all the info at my fingertips, I just can't seem to compile it. Ah well, there's always tomorrow.  I talked to Mandy today too, FINALLY (lol) and we're still on for prom, same with Steven and Becky. Should be fun...  Goodnight world! I love  all  most of you :)

             Yeah it's been a bit since I posted last... Here are pictures of random happenings of late:   Mel's house tonight  *looks at clock* I guess it was last night actually. All the people in these pictures plus Gwen, YoungHee and Adri went to see Shrek 2... Fairly good movie actually, pretty funny. Later all of us minus Adri and YoungHee went back to Mel's (where the pics were taken) to watch Evil Alien Conquerors. Note I only happened to remember that I had my camera with me and subsequently use it   after   Gwen left, so though she isn't in any of the pictures, she was there with us most of the evening. o.O James, one of the guys in the pictures, gave me one of his shirts from back when he used to work at Wendy's! So cool... (lol)   My NEST group's last meeting on Friday  (a school mandated grouth group of sorts)   My cellphones on Thursday  (Note the plural... I got my phone replaced but forgot to back up the phone directory... It pays to have friends in Sprint: I got to keep them both for a day.)

I was crying for a variety of reasons almost the entire retreat - rarely actually in tears but my soul wept the entire time. Winema is always emotional for me, but this one was a thousand times more so. As I told someone, "I love/hated it"   Holy crap, I thought I was done, but no. (I'm crying again)

      I wrote this in 3rd period Senior English on Wed. when all the seniors were gone, going on the retreat one day early.    The Seniors    The times you've left me with Are all but passed me by, And you go on with life While I sit here and cry.  Eyes will dry, tears will pass And my life too will go on. Until that time, here, now, My mem'ries I'll ponder on.  For none can know what lies in store,      'Save but the great Divine Through trust in Him I'll tarry on,      On 'till the end of time.  And you with Him I know I'll meet      If never again shall see, Past the last day of this summer      When I a Senior, be.    Yeah, um... I was sad.

      The weirdest thing just happened to me... I was leaving my friend's house which happens to be four houses down from Mr. Olesen (my IT team leader)'s house and he started pulling out of his driveway. I passed him and a couple streets down he pulled alongside me because I was turning left and he was going straight. I waved at him but he didn't seem to recognize me and it was our turn to go, so I turned and continued on my way thinking I'd ask him at our next meeting if he realized later who it was. A tiny bit later, I turned left again onto TV Highway and started cruising in the left lane, when who should pull up alongside me, but... Mr. Olesen (lol) He motioned for me to pull over to the side of the road and started to do so himself so I followed suit by putting my turn signal on and starting to switch to his lane so I could get off onto the shoulder. Right at that moment some idiot it a raised pickup decided to gun it and swerve around him before he was even out of his lane, in the process cut off the person behind me and nearly collided with me. I swerved back into my lane as he roared past then signaled and finally got off onto the shoulder. Mr. Olesen saw the entire thing and had to drive up to meet me since I was a significant ways down the road after that idiot cut me off. The reason for all this was that he had loaned me a key to a storage unit that we were storing a ton of PCs in and needed it back - when he saw me he thought he'd come flag me down but "didn't anticipate almost getting me into a wreck" LOL

       Hoobastank - Losing My Grip    Another night follows the day Like a child does to its mother And everywhere I look I see your face On the face of others And I can't escape the pain  Through all the questions I went through I never told myself the truth I turned my back on you and me Cuz I was scared to say That we weren't who we used to be So now I'm Trying hard to let go Let you go But I can't seem to Loosen my grip Trying hard to let go Let you go Let you go  I feel an emptiness inside A part of me already died But I pretend that you go on Like everything's okay Then all we built begins to fall As I began to lose it all Shut my eyes to set me free Cuz I was scared to say That we weren't who we used to be So now I'm  Trying hard to let go Let you go But I can't seem to Loosen my grip Trying hard to let go Let you go Let you go  You're all that I've ever wanted  You're everything that I need But now it's finally over Time for goodbyes I need it so now I'm Trying hard to let go Let you go But I can't seem to  Loosen my grip Trying hard to let go Let you go Let you go Trying hard to let go Let you go

      Lol... I'm posting this from my dad's laptop via a Wi-Fi card, via my neighbor's unsecure network.  [Edit]I love how people just randomly don't know how to use WEP. It's great for people like me and Steven... Though better for him than 'cause of his Pocket PC. Later I'll see about browsing their network, but I'm quite content now using it to simply connect to the web and get removal tools for whatever varient of Mydoom happens to be afflicting the laptop. Let their network get infected, not mine. *evil grin* ;) [/Edit]

      Powerful song that does a good job of capturing our youth's want-everything-now mindset (plus it's just plain beautiful)  Listening to:  Freshman - Verve Pipe    When I was young I knew everything She a punk who rarely ever took advice Now I'm guilt stricken, Sobbing with my head on the floor Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice  I can't be held responsible She was touching her face I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen  My best friend took a week's Vacation to forget her His girl took a weeks's worth of Valium and slept And now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his Head on the floor Thinks about her now and how he never really Wept he says  I can't be held responsible She was touching her face I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen  hey yeah  hey yeah hey yeah   We've tried to wash our hands of all this We never talk of our lacking relationships And how we're guilt stricken sobbing with our Heads on the floor We fell through the ice when we tried not to Slip, we'd say  I can't be held responsible She was touching her face And I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen We were merely freshmen

      Major prayer request: This is still just in the hear-say phase, but apparently an old friend of mine got accidently hit in the head by a flying baseball bat today and had to get 40+ stitches. 'Will keep people informed as I become informed, but chances are that a few of you already know more about it than I do.

      1. Go into your LJ's archives. 2. Find your 23rd post (or closest to). 3. Find the fifth sentence (or closest to). 4. Post the text of the sentence in your blog along with these instructions.    For the first hour or so, until Butters decided to show up, I was the only guy among, like 20 girls at the party.

      Listening to  Moby - Porcelain    In my dreams I'm dying all the time Then I wake its kaleidoscopic mind I never meant to hurt you I never meant to lie So this is goodbye This is goodbye Tell the truth you never wanted me Tell me... In my dreams I'm jealous all the time Then I wake I'm going out of my mind Going out of my mind   Wow, I just went back and re-read my  entire  blog for the first time in a couple months. A blog's alot like a picture album, though it's got more than just the good times in it. I've never really thought about it like that before.  At the beginning of the year I spend 10+ hours compiling a book-almost of my blog posts from the first time I posted to the end of last year. Heh, most of it's depressing, but that's alright because my life's been a depressing one so I guess it accurately mirrors it.  Eventually I will print it out and maybe even put it on the web… I think it’s over a hundred pages (lol).

      Well I took the SAT 1s today... the math sections were a piece of cake, even though I *erm* forgot my calculator. (LOL) Adri was the only other person I know going to Beaverton to take it too and we somehow got into the same room. That was cool. I gave her a ride home and am looking forward to her party later tonight.  On Thursday our entire school up and went to see a play at Heritage called Happens Every Summer at 11:something. I love my school, so funny - mandatory play patronization. The play was pretty lacking in content, bad script choice, though the talent was wonderful. By the end of it I wanted to run up and punch the Georgian hoe (though the fact she was, after all, just an actress taking the form of the character held me back - LOL).   Thursday also, my mom had to take our orange cat Leo into be put down. Sux, but he's been in a ton of pain and stuff from his leg all his life so I guess it's a good thing. We got another cute cute black kitten a couple hours ago and my sister's occupying herself with that one now.  Speaking of pets, Gwen has to take Rascal, her dog, to the vet today at 2:30 to put her down too. Sux... That's gonna be a ton harder on her than my sister's cat has been on her since Gwen's had her dog for something like 12 years. Yeah, I'll see how she's doing at the party tonight I guess.   ... Heh, if I can go that is... My mom's being weird about homework again - might not let me go tonight.

      Listening to:  Taproot - Poem    overbearing panic attack entrenching my veins In an hour i'll be ok  I pray this pain will go away permanently someday  I'VE seen more than... I should have to... I'VE seen this on my own  this song is a, poem to myself, it helps me to live...  in case of fire, BREAK the glass,  and move on into your own... your own...  reoccurring drowning effect entrenching my brain, I hope you'll be ok someday, so I can say that you moved on in the right way...  WE'VE seen this and  WE'VE breathed this and  WE'VE lived this on our own...  this song is a, poem to myself, it helps me to live...  in case of fire, BREAK the glass,  and move on into your own... your own...  BREAK...  this song is a, poem to myself, it helps me to live...  in case of fire, BREAK the glass,  and move on into your own...   Well, today was enjoyable. 'Got up around 10 o'clock, took a shower, headed to CCWC for the first time in ... forever. I saw Sarah (Steven's gf) for the second time there, the first was in Jan. (I think - lol) Later I ran into the Gadeholts and Ben, and followed them over to the Gadeholt's house where I stayed until past 9. Well, that's not entirely true, I did go with them to pick up Kat from Washington square and to go eat at Xtine's restraunt... but that doesn't count since I was with them.   Man, that was fun... I miss my sophmore year.

      Well, I went to  PCC 's youth group tonight. 'Twas a special service because their 80-person choir just got back from a tour in Cali - only went to 8 o'clock. There was a party afterwards at someone's house till 10... LOL That was a huge amount of cars for that small a street. It was only like 70 out, and some crazy people jumped into the pool anyway... the spa I understand, but not the pool.  Afterward, while I was driving home on TV highway, west of 170th, I saw a photo-radar vehicle on the side of the road and immediately checked my speed... under 55, so I didn't slow down. When I passed it though, the thing flashed and when I got home I checked with my mom and apparently that section of road's 45, not 55. Gayness... whatever, so I guess I have my first ticket... I'm upset, but not about the ticket so much as how little the thing was that I got it for... I wanted my first ticket to be for going 120 in a 45 or something like that...   Oh well.

      Listening to:  Story of the year - Sidewalks   I should prolly get to bed eventually. (lol) Yesterday morning I stayed up untill past 6am I think... Doubt that I'll repeat that this morning, but I'm well on my way.  I didn't really do anything today 'cept work on assorted computer stuff and clean my room(s). I removed that LAN I had running secretly into my upstairs room because I'm moving entirely down here and if I ever need it again, it's quite easy to reinstall... just need another half-hour with the house to myself.  Oh, Brent called me right after 11 tonight (... technically last night) and said that Tyler had run over to Bally but it had gotten dark and he needed a ride. Brent would have done it, but he was sick, so I got to get out of the house to give him a ride... I LOVE driving at night... hot nights. I'm getting better at driving with my knees; nothing beats blazing down TV highway at 70+ with the seat reclined and your hands behind your head with the windows down and the music blazing at midnight on a hot summer night. ;)  Dos cervesas~ ('two beers' in Spanish)

      I very *heart* this song...    Story of the Year - Sidewalks    The bridge is all crumbled.  The water soaks into rocks  that fell at the bottom of the road (At the end of the town.) The town that we lived in.  The memories shaken apart from the weeds that grow  Over the sidewalks,  Running away from the streets we knew,  Sidewalks,  Like the time we thought was made for you.  Or   Out on the front porch,  watching the cars as they go by (Eighteen blue, twenty one grey)  Looking ahead for the first time that we could drive,  Out on our own,  To speed away   From the sidewalks,  Running away from the streets we knew,  Sidewalks,  Like the time we thought was made for you.  Or   All of the days have passed us by,  All of the sun is gone... away.   Sidewalks,  Running away from the streets we knew,   Sidewalks,  Running away from the streets we knew,  Sidewalks,  Like the time we thought was made for you.  (Sidewalks)  The bridges are crumpled,  (Sidewalks)  The water soaks into rocks,  That fell at the bottom of the road.

      I really, REALLY need to update about the last week and a half and I'm at summer school and a poster I noticed up on the wall of all the graduates walking down the isle almost two weeks ago inspired me to finally come back and update this (lol).  Friday... I got to the last day of school at the beginning of the LAST PERIOD... I had set my phone (my suto-alarmclock) on vibrate the night before for my sister's 8th grade grduation, so when it went off to wake me up, it well... vibrated. My parents apparenly didn't see the wisdom in actually venturing into my room untill close to noon, but rather, repeatedly called my phone, which again, was on vibrate. When I got to school, I handed in a project and took a test, neither of which were for the class that I had that period... and spent the rest of the time walking around school with my video camera.  Later that night was Faith's Senior Graduation. As is my custom, I videotaped that in its entirety as well. I'm thinking about encoding it in divx and pushing it out onto Kazaa via my neighbor's connection... Might eventually get around to it, might not too...  Anyway, after the graduation, I went home, spent time doing... something, dunno what but in any event I spent quite a while doing it... packed up my computer and finally arrived at the first of 8 or so graduation parties I would be attending from then till Sunday night (Jon-Mark's) at around midnight. Yeah, that was great fun :) Many hours of watching random videos and tv shows, all off my computer, through the night. Mel was funny, every little while she thought she was leaving... in a little while, but eventually she just ended up staying the entire night with us.  I went back to my house, or at least I think I went back to my house... not really sure... whatever, in any event, Jon-Mark, Darren and I went to several more grad parties on Sat, ending up at Eric Zoucha's that night... I had had no sleep for over 30 hours by this time and had been driving them around most of the day while they slept (lol) So it's completely understandable that I fell into a coma-like sleep on Eric's chair... and could not be wakened by any means whatsoever... well, understandable when you know that other time that I've fallen asleep like that, I've been shot with bb guns at point-blank and not waken up.  Anyway, they got a ride home with their dad, and I woke up past midnight at Eric's... I should have just stayed there, but I went back home. Many of us met up again at parties later Sunday, but I missed the one at their church that I wanted to go to.  That pretty much raps up the graduation weekend... on to more events of the week in further posts.

      Well I just woke up about 10 minutes ago... realized taht I've missplaced my glasses and don't feel like putting my contacts in, so I'm sitting back in my chair, for all practical purposes blind to the computer, touchtyping a post (lol). Wow, I think that was  along sentence but I'm not sure because I don't feel like quinting to read it ;) Speaking of touchtyping, I recal a time steven was here, turned around looking at my tv, talking to me, and still typing IMs behind his back  ... he just wanted me to mention that ;) (It did really happen though)  TO give you an idea of how late I've been getting to bed lately, I got to bed at 12:30 last night and it took three hours+ for me to get to sleep. LOL The start of summer school was this morning... I didn't make it... woke up at 2:30pm  I'm realizing now that I haven't really posted anything realivant to anything going on lately for the past week+ soI'm going to do taht, provided I find my glasses and/or contacts in a timely manner (lol)  For now, goodbye~

              pics from today   Yeah, so today was the Seniors' last day at school, plus Senior Wills as an end of day assembly. I got willed a senior star (something put on their locker at the beginning of the year... special way to remember the person by when you get one willed to you) by Matt and Gwen, a t-shirt with paint on it from Lenny (from when we painted that church way back when...), some almost-finished bombs from our Chem. class from Gwen, and print of some of YoungHee's amazing artwork from... er... YoungHee. (lol)  I'm gonna ty to get my scanner online sometime tonight and post a scan of the print.  Later tonight I attended my sister Azita's 8th grade graduation.  Man school tomorrow's going to suck really bad and the graduation itself's not going to be much better. I shall be much crying. Hopefully the graduate's receptions later that night and the following day will cheer me up temporarily though.

       What if he was cradling a gun in his hands, mumbling, "Myyy preeeciousss" while he was walking around. I bet he wouldn't get mugged then.   o.O LOL!  ...found in  http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/30/2252233&mode=thread&tid=126&tid=137&tid=172 (a discussion about what geeks can do to help protect themselves and their valuables from muggers)  more comments on the topic:   In the UK, you are not allowed to own a gun, let alone carry one. Not even the cops carry fireamrs.  HALT! Or I'll be forced to yell HALT again, but louder!    --------------------------------------------------    That's not too far off from what I do. It's not jock-style, but it works for me.  I'm 6'2" tall, I have long black hair, a bullring style nose ring, a scuffed black leather jacket, a motorcycle and a visible knife clipped to my pocket.  I don't dress like I have money, and if I have to walk through a bad neighborhood, I make sure I look angry. My friends and I can walk past a gang, and they tend to part like the Red Sea.  I'm the scariest looking sysadmin I've seen in corporate america.     --------------------------------------------------    I have a friend that real life role plays. He was dressed up in his medieval armor and cloak garb waiting at a train station one day. A mugger came up to him with a 4 inch knife and said "give me your wallet". My mate stared him in the face and moved his cloak to reveal a 30 inch long sword. "I see your 4 and raise you 26". Should have seen him run.    --------------------------------------------------    I had a mugging problem when I was in San Francisco. Got mugged twice before I realized that muggers are very predictable. They like their targets to be predictable as well. I found that wearing a dirty shrunken wool jacket I got from goodwill, carrying extra bags, and yelling at people that wearen't there was a great way to avoid getting mugged.

       Excerpts from Paul Graham's ' Great Hackers ' essay:    "I've seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers. Really there should be two articles: one about what to do if you are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you're not. And the second could probably be condensed into two words: give up."  "Really good hackers are practically self-managing. The problem is, if you're not a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are. A similar problem explains why American cars are so ugly. I call it the design paradox. You might think that you could make your products beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them. But if you yourself don't have good taste, how are you going to recognize a good designer?"  "Working on nasty little problems makes you stupid. Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid cheeseburgers."  "One place this happens is in startups. At our startup we had Robert Morris working as a system administrator. That's like having the Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah. You can't hire that kind of talent. But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies of which they're the founders."  "They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why. I think what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously, is the next Microsoft. And of course if Microsoft is your model, you shouldn't be looking for companies that hope to win by writing great software. But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft, because no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some other company is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be the next IBM."  "So who are the great hackers? How do you know when you meet one? That turns out to be very hard. Even hackers can't tell. I'm pretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker. You may have read on Slashdot how he made his own Segway. The remarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the software in one day (in Python, incidentally). For Trevor, that's par for the course. But when I first met him, I thought he was a complete idiot. He was standing in Robert Morris's office babbling at him about something or other, and I remember standing behind him making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his office so we could go to lunch. Robert says he misjudged Trevor at first too. Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had just begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about every aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried with him everywhere. He'd also just arrived from Canada, and had a strong Canadian accent and a mullet."  "With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell. That's because, unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects. When you get to hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone, you learn pretty quickly how hard they hit them back. But hackers can't watch themselves at work. So if you ask a great hacker how good he is, he's almost certain to reply, I don't know. He's not just being modest. He really doesn't know.  "If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, including him."     Greg Knauss 's rebuttle found on  waxy.org  :    You know what a hacker is? It's someone who enjoys solving problems. Great hackers do it elegantly. Good hackers do it at all. How they do it is irrelevant, and it certainly has nothing to do with what language they choose or what OS they run or if they're politically correct or not. To claim otherwise is arrogant, narrow-minded foolishness.  The fact that I'm learning C# and Windows.Forms does not make me any less of a hacker. In fact, it makes me more of one, because I'm able to solve a problem I couldn't with all the Python and Linux in the world. Oh, but I forgot: hackers only solve the problems that interest them, if they're presented in the right way and in the right environment. Because hackers are special.    also found on  waxy.org  :     Joshua  pointed out that while it may seem that every smart person I know is using open-source tools, it's a product of observational bias. Open-source programmers hang out with other open-source programmers. I don't know many Windows applications developers, so I've never met a Windows super-genius. But they exist, and to say they don't is a form of technophobic racism.

      "You just defaced property of the US government! ...You rebel" -Scully to Mulder  I woke up pretty late today... almost 11 or so, and headed over to school to get some work done. Jen and I were talking to Mel via IM around 2 and she invited us to come over to Washington Square for a bit with her friend whose name suddenly escape me and the friend's boyfriend, Joe. Anyway, we went sperately, and when I got there, I found them up at the Summit foodcourt getting well, food. (lol) I asked them where they lived and they responded Beaverton and North Plains and we were talking about how they were similar to Danie and Jon cause they live about the same distance away when I look up and see... Danie. LOL It took about ten minutes for any of the to notice us, but Danie, Jaime, their mom, their cousins and Jon were all there.            When we were done eating and such, we went down to Victoria's Secret to see if Cherry was there... Alas, she wasn't so we went across to the Mac store and messed with their computers. Now, anyone that knows anything about the difference between Macs and PCs knows that Windows cannot be installed on a Mac... at least not without an emulator, but that's complicated and a lot of people have no idea how to do that. Anyway, following Steven's example from the last time, I remote logged into first my computer and then both Steven's and my computers so it looks to the untrained eye, like the Macs have windows on them. I got a lot of strange looks. ;)

      I went to sleep this morning at around 4am and woke up somewhere around 8am. I spent like 45 minutes in the shower and so doing, made everyone slightly late to church. The little church we were going to is on the East side... just ten or so blocks away from my uncle's house. When we arrived there, we discovered that the service was going to be starting a bit later, so my sisters and I drove over to my uncle's house while mom practiced (she was playing for the service at the request of an old friend who attends the church). My uncle ended up not being home, so we called him and via his directions, met him and Natalia at a cafe a quarter mile away. That was fun, especially since I hadn't seen him in a month (due to his having been in Europe). We talked for a while, mostly about the impending divorce. I love talking to my uncle, granted he leans pretty leftwing-liberal in his thinking; he's got a good head on his shoulders and is very insightful.  My sisters and I ordered some breakfast along with them and only then discovered that the service was starting a lot earlier than we had thought. Eventually we got back to the church and quietly entered during the sermon... unfortunately for us, Mom and my Aunt were sitting in the very front, and I was wearing by far the brightest shirt in the building ;) Whatever, later my mom had us stand up while she introduced us, so attention wasn't to be avoided anyway.   Later, once the service was over, we got to meet my mom's friend's daughter Deanna her friend Patricia. Patricia happened to be their old foreign exchange student from Germany and was back visiting them (or at least, that's how I understood it).  Anyway, the plan was for us to all go to the Kabob Khaneh (Kabob House) in Beaverton, and my sisters and I rode along with Deanna and Patricia. That was fun... when I first got in the car the radio was playing Verve Pipe - The Freshman. Deanna and I immediately starting singing along with it to the other rider's consternation... LOL  We ate, walked around a bit, took pictures (which one or both of them hopefully will be emailing to me soon so I get them up here...) and got ice cream and Hagendaz (spl?) Deanna's dad had some type of PDA that had a hangman game on it... that was a source of entertainment for a bit too. (lol)  Deanna and Patricia are really fun to hang around... wish we lived a little closer to each other, though Patricia is going back to Germany fairly soon so that's event further than the East side (LOL) Apparently Deanna's an amazing artist... she mentioned something about getting space in a gallery on this side of the river that we passed by... I should ask her about that.  We parted company around 2:30pm or so and we headed back home, and Pat came over shortly there after. We set around for a while and eventually got some flowers and headed over to Adri's house (who just got her wisdom teeth out a couple days ago...) She's feeling better, but still looks like a self-described chipmunk (lol). She wanted me to take a picture of her and post it, but we forgot about it... maybe tomorrow or something.  Yeah and the rest of the day's been rather boring now that Pat left...

      Yeah... for some reason some of us felt like skipping youth group yesterday so we had a party at my house. I was talking to Sara last week and she mentioned going to see the Bourne Supremacy, Thursday night at midnight, so I thought why not have everyone else come too? Unfortunately Mandy, Adri, Katy V and Steven weren't able to be out that late for one reason or another so they came to the party but didn't come with Mel, Katie, Matt R, Josh H, Andrew, Pat, Allen and I to the movie.  The party was interesting... we watched two different movies at the same time, The Bourne Identity (since it's rather essential to see before seeing the sequel) and Good Burger. Then arm wresting and... er... leg wresting - something I'd never seen before.  The movie was fairly good... great plot, but I hated the ending and the cinematography during some of the action scenes was heavily annoying... infact the final chase scene was downright boring as a result.  Pat, Matt, Andrew and Josh stayed overnight afterward... we watched Kill Bill - strange, strange movie (directed by the same person that did Pulp Fiction) one of the scenes had to be black and white just to avoid an NC-17 rating. LOL  We woke up at noon or so and I took Andrew to work shortly there after... Then we that remained had fun shooting some bottles and fences and... houses with Pat's AEGs. Then came the water balloons... that kept us occupied for a couple hours (it's just a couple degrees shy of 100 today). I finally pegged a car that I was trying to hit for a while then we focused our effort on more... shall we say, mobile targets.  Josh, Matt and Pat left around an hour ago and I'm in my room listening to  American Hi-Fi - Nothing Left to Lose

      My piece of sh*t motherboard is yet again having issues with my videocard so my primary computer is out of comission until I have the initiative to remove every component and power it back up sequentially 'till it decides that it's no longer broken.  Gay computer.  On sunday, as you already know from the previous post, I woke up late and went to a local school where some friends of mine were hainging out. After everyone dispersed, Pat and I went over to Adri's to bug her and kill time before he had to be at college group at Pr. Drew's house. I decided to be adventurous and see if Drew would let me come too (though I'm still a senior) and after many inventive ways of finding his phone number, I finally was able to ask, and he yes, it was fine to visit it that night. I followed Pat over, driving my dad's über spiffy car (hehe).   Yeah, that was a great night... been a long time since I played Mau with Sara & Beth(LOL) There were a ton of people there that I know but had no idea went there.  At the end of the night, Greg Anderson and I were talking ... mostly about my family and stuff, and I mentioned that it's like they're divorced, but still living together, infact if it weren't for us, they would be divorced. He had trouble hearing me and asked "but they're not actually divorced right?" ... Little did I know.  ... Which brings me to my next news flash... My parents are getting a divorce. I was informed that night when I got home ironically.  Man, I really wish I could join that college group... I need some people like them in my life right now.

      First, let me comment that blogger  again  has changed slightly for the better... but just the backend, so all you non-bloggers can't see what I'm talking about.   Second... Peter and Solana are gone, GONE... kinda. (lol) They be in Aussyland now. Here are some pictures from the airport today around 6-7ish:     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      I had picked up Andrew and met Brady and Pat at CCWC to carpool out to Peter's to pick him up and go to the airport, so we (-Peter) went back to CCWC afterward, a bit after youth group started. Brady left cause he's old (lol), but Pat, Andrew and I stayed... at first in the 'Nursing Mom's room' (which is really tight... there'a one-way mirror so you can see/hear everything that's going on in the sanctuary but no one can see/hear you. Eventually though, the senior high went upstairs, so we followed, but skipped shortly there after (-Pat, +Matt &amp; Josh H) and went to Freddy's. On the way back we ran into the rest of our clique and here are pictures from then on:     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      Now for the stupidness... I had some spraypaint in my car which we had been lead to believe was water soluble. Someone had sprayed a big smily face on one side of the parking lot and we had set a big firework off ontop of it. Nothing much more happened for a while and almost everyone left. We were starting to get a bit more crazy (lighting firecrackers off between people's feet and such... LOL@Adri) when I got the great idea of writing some random words on the parking lot like L337 H4x0r and stuff... (lol). About that time, Steven needed to use the restroom and since everywhere else was closed, he went over to the gas station across TV highway. While he was walking over, Andrew set of another bomb we had made and crap, that thing was LOOOOOOOOOUD. Steven said he heard it echoing off the theater and other buildings more than a block away while he was walking across the highway. 'Twas so loud infact, that we pretty much told everyone still around that they should leave... NOW. (worried about cops)   Anyway, I was taking Andrew and Steven home... and Steven wasn't there, so we cruised around and eventually found him. We decided to go back to the parking lot after a bit whe we new it was safe and realized that the spraypaint and stuff prolly wasn't going to come off as easily as we thought. We spent the next hour (up till almost midnight) trying different things, even going over to a 7-11 to get Coke to see if it'd lift the paint. ... Nothing worked.   Here are some pictures of the mess:     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      Yeah... that was increadibly stupid. I called the church office asking someone to call me back tomorrow *looks at clock*... today to see about how I could help clean it up.   'Ne wayz, I'm tired and it may not look like it, but it actually takes an increadible long time to post all those pictures correctly, so I'm going to bed.

             Yeah, I got an earing today... Summer school's gonna be interesting: my school's got this thing about guys and earings... they hate them. (lol) Apparently though I can get away with wearing a band-aid over it... don't ask me, I'm not the one that made up the rules. ;)  In other news:   Scheduled Downtime    We are planning to have 2 hours of downtime tomorrow night, July 13, between 8p-10p (Pacific Time). Blogging should resume as normal after 10p. – Jason G. [7/12/2004 04:36:27 PM]

It's really cool... there's a huge open reservoir (several hundred feet to a side) with banks going up to 100 feet tall... would be an awesome place to set off some mortars. There's also a wide street that no one uses yet that's awesome to try out skids and stuff on.  'Ne way, after that, I met Andrew and Jon at Wu's (a Chinese restaurant) and then went back to Andrew's for a night of fun. (lol) I just got home several minutes ago and felt like posting, so here I am...  Actually, I'm not that tired... that's not a good thing since I've slept through summer school this entire week. :P

      Yeah... I was at Darren and Jon-Mark's today for their joint birthday party... I *ahem* only found out that it was a party for  both of them  after I got there, so I only got Darren a present. (Sorry Jon, yours is coming - lol) Darren’s birthday was today, Jon's is this Sat.  Btw, I'm operating like yesterday is actually 'today' again on account of my not having slept yet, so Darren's b-day is actually on the 8th.  I didn't get any pictures or anything because my mom has the camera at the moment... and I just found out today that my dad's taking our camcorder with him on his month-long trip to Iran in a week; a fact that I'm none to pleased about and that has me working like mad dumping footage onto my computer and editing it before he takes it.  Whatever... I've got summer school tomorrow morning and I've slept though it every other day this week so I'd better get off and at least try to get to sleep.  G'night world~

      Here's the pics and video from Adri's party...  7-2-04, 7-3-04 sleepover (33:46)  urlLink divx 233Mb  If you don't have the divx codec, get it! (you can find the latest version  urlLink here )                                                                                On Monday I went up to Brady's house for what was supposed to be another going-away party for Peter, but alas, Peter himself could not make it. (LOL) Anyway, Pat, Brady, Cori and I just hung out for a while. That was pretty fun. While I was up there, I tried to dl that fireworks video from last post and decided that I wanted to make a short video of just the cooler stuff fireworks that we set off this weekend, so here it is:  Cool fireworks (1:53)  urlLink divx 12.8Mb   Then, yesterday (the 6th... I haven't slept tonight - still consider today the 7th) James 'became a number'. LOL He joined the Navy... Jen, MJ, Melissa, Darren and I went to MEPS to meet him and his gf, Jessica, and went with him to the airport to see him off.                                             Andrew and I were talking afterward and apparently he still is really thinking about going SEAL... the only issue is his eyes, but he prolly can get Lasic surgery. I've got the same problem as far as joining the SEALs, and we're both thinking that if the draft does get re-instated next year that we're going to enlist.  Today, I woke up really late for some reason... totally missed summer school (lol). I went to my math teacher's house for a party with my Calc class at 7pm. It was to finish watching LotR RotK, we'd finished the class early and were trying to watch all three movies before school was out, but we didn't make it in time, so Miss O, being the awsome teacher she is, invited us over to finish it. Everyone but Gwen and Danie came (we had a small class).

      Ok, this is the first set of a long train of movies and pictures that I'm going to be posting in the near future...  7.4.04 illegal fireworks (24:48)  urlLink low 5.39Mb   urlLink med 18.1Mb   urlLink high 40.7Mb   I highly suggest a download manager like  urlLink Getright .  A word of caution too: these files are hosted off my home connection... If they become too much of a burden on my bandwidth, I'll take them down. So whenever possible, please try to keep your downloading to night time.  Oh, and sorry about the wmv format... I would encode them in something a little more cross-platform, but for all its failings, Windows Movie Maker does have the ability to compress video to insanely small files... and it only encodes in wmv. Contact me for a divx version of any of the movies and I'll post it if it's needed.  Thanks :)

      Listening to:  Story of the Year - Razorblades    Yeah, Yeah Walking example of you Wait for the silence Talking backwards to you It meant nothing to me Watching the world fall on you I'm keeping my eyes closed Now I can see what this means to you It meant nothing to me  [Chorus] This wasted so many nights and again I've wasted so much time on a friend Too young, too proud to understand So this is the end  Perfect timing for you You'll run 'til your legs break So here's my reminder of you It meant nothing to me  [Chorus] This wasted so many nights and again I've wasted so much time on a friend Too young, too proud to understand So this is the end...GO!  We should've seen this coming We should've seen this... YEAH! YEAH!  [Chorus x2] This wasted so many nights and again I've wasted so much time on a friend Too young, too proud to understand So this is the end  YEAH! This is the END!   The last couple days have been awesome! Partying non-stop... On the 1st, Spiderman at the Redshaw's house then Spiderman II at the theater (good movie btw, I'm never watching the first one by itself again), then afterward back to the Redshaw's, then to Wendy's. And yeah Darren, the people sitting beside us were prolly confused as heck... ROFL ... Good times, good times. Anyway, after eating, a firework at the Redshaw's again then off to their youth group (short but fun). Still after, walking all over the place, hanging out with Tye, who I've not seen in years (at least I think...) and then finally blowing up a big firework in front of Matt R's unsuspecting house somewhere close to 11.  Then on the 2nd... Getting to summer school late, staying until 2, giving Kat a ride to Neil's house... playing pool and badminton for a while, then picking up Steven from his work and getting over to Adri's house past 5:30. Basically everyone from our circle of friends at school was there save Gwen who happened to have left for a couple-week long mission trip the same morning. We sneaked into the garage and surprised them by coming in through the back of the house... that was great fun. At some point we were messing around outside and someone stuck Adri in a compost recycling bin (ensuing chaos and funness... like the owners of the bin coming out of their house and us fleeing, and the girls getting into a water fight which led to them getting into the hot tub in the back). Josh and I went back to our houses and got several swimsuits, and we and Steven joined them. Then pizza and the fireworks....   HAHAHAHA... that was great too; I constructed a petebomb that had an actual piccolo pete as the igniter... Everyone had been warned to stay back and cover their ears - it would be loud, but the fuse took a while to work so when the peter finally caught they started to relax and think that that was the only thing going to happen... hehe, like I planned it. *evil grin* Then, without warning, BOOM the thing blew up and the entire cul-de-sac (spl?) was filled with little crackling fireballs. LOL that was so funny.  After this, Steven, Josh, Darren, and I came up to my house quickly (kinda...) to make a couple more bomb-style fireworks which we eventually lit off in the LDS stakehouse parking lot later by ourselves (the plan was for everyone else to come after we'd set it up and watch, but Adri's mom wouldn't let them. It was huge... we attached three 'normal-sized' bombs together.  We took Josh and Josiah back home less than a minute before their curfew and headed back to Adri's where we found a disgruntled crowd amiss at not having witnessed the big firework... so we took a walk all the way to Josh's house (but didn't go in... his dad didn't want him up... then continued to our English teacher's house outside of which we set and talked for a while and finally headed home and found Rachel, Jen and Mandy in the hot tub.  At this point, Steven and I were the only guys left and we didn't feel like leaving so ... er, we didn't (lol). I eventually got back into the hot tub only to get right back out again to go back up to my house to grab my glasses, contacts kit and chargers / batteries for both cameras and my phone (which everyone had killed by talking to Josh for over an hour - lol).   We just hung out and watched movies until like 7 or 8am when some people went back over to pick up Josh and Josiah again. Steven had to be at Sarah's at noon, and hadn't packed yet so I took him home shortly there after, and went back to my house and crashed around 9... Thus ending yet another co-ed sleepover. (lol)   I woke up past 6pm, took a shower, left, got gas, and arrived at Peter's in Forest Grove close to 9. Everyone just got back from an hour of warwalking a few minutes after, so I came at a good time. We spent a couple hours constructing and setting off fireworks... we got pretty crazy t'word the end... just dumping everything we could get out hands on into cinderblocks and throwing lit fireworks into them... hehe  *I wonder if the sparkler writing's still on the ground...*  I finally left past close to 2am and decided that I was going to do that speed test of my car right then and there... was tired of trying to set up a time for people to film me doing it. ;) But... after passing the second police car and encountering a lot of traffic on highway 8 before I even got to the section I was going to test on, I decided to call it off. I made up for it though by going 90mph on Rosedale and 110mph on 175th. :D ... That was great fun.  I'm sitting at home writing this right now, getting ready to head over to the Neff's for yet another evening of fun and fireworks...  I've got pictures of the last several days and I'm working on compressing the video I shot so I can get it up on my server... those will be up within a couple days pending the approval of everyone [read: the girls] who was at the sleepover that might be finnicky about it.  Bye everyone, cya ya'll soon enough~

       This is highly amusing...   A short list of my favorite 'things not allowed to do':   33. Not allowed to chew gum at formation, unless I brought enough for everybody.   34. (Next day) Not allowed to chew gum at formation even if I *did* bring enough for everybody.   58. The following words and phrases may not be used in a cadence- Budding sexuality, necrophilia, I hate everyone in this formation and wish they were dead, sexual lubrication, black earth mother, all Marines are latent homosexuals, Tantric yoga, Gotterdammerung, Korean hooker, Eskimo Nell, we've all got jackboots now, slut puppy, or any references to squid.  84. Must not use military vehicles to ‘Squish' things.   87. If the thought of something makes me giggle for longer than 15 seconds, I am to assume that I am not allowed to do it.   94. Crucifixes do not ward off officers, and I should not test that.   100. Claymore mines are not filled with yummy candy, and it is wrong to tell new soldiers that they are.   106. I may not trade my rifle for any of the following: Cigarettes, booze, sexual favors, Kalishnikovs, Soviet Armored vehicles, small children, or bootleg CD’s.   118. Burn pits for classified material are not revel fires - therefore it is wrong to dance naked around them.   132. The loudspeaker system is not a forum to voice my ideas.   145. I should not drink three quarts of blue food coloring before a urine test.   146. Nor should I drink three quarts of red food coloring, and scream during the same.   165. I do not get 'that time of month'.   175. We do not 'charge into battle, naked, like the Celts'.   184. When operating a military vehicle I may *not* attempt something 'I saw in a cartoon'.   195. Shouldn't use Photoshop ® to create incriminating photos of my chain of command.   205. Don't write up false gigs on a HMMWV PMCS. ("Broken clutch pedal", "Number three turbine has frequent flame-outs", "flux capacitor emits loud whine when engaged")

      We got up this morning and vacated our crappy motel pretty quickly. My mom had gone out on a walk with Cynthia, her friend who lives locally in San Fransisco, and had just come back when we my sisters and I were waking up. We left our car at the Cynthia's and walked down the Fisherman's Wharf where we caught a tour ferry and rode around the bay for an hour and a half. Then we walked up to Ghiradelli Square, had lunch and stopped in at Cynthia's house for a while. She has a projector, screen and surround sound system in her bedroom! :) :) Exiting the city, we drove down Lombard street (the windiest street in the U.S.).  It took us over 6 hours to drive to LA (well, actually Vernonia - an LA suburb that Six Flags is located in). It's interesting: we've driven  exactly  1000.1 miles from my front door to the front of this hotel... We've got a picture to prove it. :)The hotel that I'm staying's within sight of Six Flags in a major way... it's like the only thing you can see looking out the windows (hehe)  Btw, my sisters and mom are trying to sleep so they kicked me out of the room and into the bathroom where I'm finishing up this post now ;)

      This is getting pretty rediculous... We reserved a room with this hotel here but they somehow overbooked, so they sent us to another hotel which didn't have room either, so now we're back again and have been wating for... over an hour... this is really starting to piss me off.

      Well, here we are screaming down the road at over 100mph.. My mom's at the wheel and it feels like we've got a couple jatos strapped to our butt. Our average speed's been around 85-90 the  entire way  out of Portland. It seems the max we've had to slow down had been to 70 in heavy ish  traffic. A bit ago we stopped in Redding to change our windshield wipers (yes, it was actually raining earlier, though the windshield's been coated with an enzime that stops rain from sticking so you almost don't even need the wipers). I picked up a pair of sunglasses for 99 cents (hehe). If they last me the rest of the week, they'll have been worth it.  Btw, I've had my eyes closed for most of this post... (spl check works wonders)

      Listening to:  Unwritten Law - Blame it on Me   Well, we're sitting here in the car on the highway just south of Roseburg... sitting, not really driving. (lol) The bright orange "Wreck Ahead" signs littering the side of the road and the fact that the left lane's blocked off with cones offers some explanation as to why.   This laptop's starting to become an annoying weight on my legs so I might put it down soon but I don't really feel like it yet.  Yeah, we just passed the accident site... from the looks of it, a 'fifth wheel' camper came off its frame and fell onto the road.
