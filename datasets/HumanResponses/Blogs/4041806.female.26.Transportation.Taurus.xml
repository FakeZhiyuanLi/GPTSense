      I'm mildly down today.&nbsp; Yesterday's lunch was a downer, then I get home and a close friend of Mickey's parents and my grandparents (remember, we live in a small town) died of cancer yesterday morning.&nbsp; I'm still in a funk today.&nbsp; That and Mickey worked late again for like the 4th night in a row.&nbsp; Work is beating him down right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anytime I call, he's in a funk or really busy.&nbsp; That and this nasty weather has led me to believe that I need to go shopping during lunch.&nbsp; The mall is about 5 minutes from here and I think Collin needs some new, cute, fall clothes, in addition to the "Wee-Elect Bush" shirt I bought him online earlier.&nbsp;   More to come...

      Every morning, upon arriving, my friend Theresa and I call each other to find out the day's most pressing question, "Did you bring your lunch today?"&nbsp; Work sucks bad enough that upon arriving, we're already thinking about our first opportunity to leave again.&nbsp; Today, she reminded me that she was planning on picking up a friend of hers who was diagnosed with cancer in March, and taking her to our favorite Italian dive.&nbsp; She said I was more than welcome to come along.&nbsp; At first I refused, part out of my thought that she needed to have some quality time with her friend, but mostly because I didn't think I could handle it.&nbsp; In ways I thought the wounds from my mother's cancer experience were too fresh, but after her continual prodding about it, I agreed to&nbsp;come along.  When faced with the threat of your parent being terminally ill, a lot of soul searching goes on, in my case anyway.&nbsp; You stop worrying about things like when you're going to get your yearly bonus.&nbsp; Suddenly, you don't care that your mom may not be around to see you climb the corporate ladder, and you start caring about the fact that she may never see you get married, or have babies.  It will always be a mystery to me regarding how my mom miraculously overcame her cancer.&nbsp; There's really not even a good scientific explanation for it.&nbsp; By all accounts, she should've died, but she didn't.&nbsp; She's here, 3 years later, hoisting Collin up to the window above her front door so he canwave goodbye to me in the morning.&nbsp; She saw me through the first few weeks of adjusting to motherhood, complete with the tearful, exhausted phone calls, and has continued to be a source of guidance and wisdom since.&nbsp;   Once we arrived at Theresa's friend's home, I was immediately taken aback.&nbsp; It was difficult for me not to break down and cry for this woman I didn't even really know, except through a friend.&nbsp; She looked so gaunt, every word was whispy, airy and labored, her baggy clothes were hanging off of her where feminine curves once existed.&nbsp; She was hopeless, ready to die.&nbsp; It broke my heart.&nbsp; She said she probably has about 2 months.&nbsp; That's what the doctor said, anyway.&nbsp; Theresa immediately told her about my Mom and I damn near lost it.&nbsp; I could barely talk to this poor woman about my mom without breaking down.&nbsp; The rest of the lunch consisted of her and Theresa talking about how she wants her funeral, and who's going to take care of her husband, etc.&nbsp;   So now I sit here at my desk, facing the rest of the afternoon in a huge funk, an eyelash away from a total crying fit.&nbsp;   I can't wait to get home to my baby, and my mom.

      Quitting is so much fun.&nbsp; Just the sheer realization that I'm out of here in a few weeks really puts things in perspective.&nbsp; Last week, while observing my replacement do some training I used to do via webconference, I was sending her chat messages about the pure stupidity of this MANAGER that was on the call.&nbsp; He showed up like 15 or 20 minutes late, was confused, had the wrong dial in information, just a bunch of stupid shit.&nbsp; I was going on in chat about how stupid he was, when she accidentally shared the chat.&nbsp; Ordinarily, I would've been mortified, but all of the sudden, I had this I-don't-give-a-shit attitude.&nbsp; He needed to hear what an ass he was, and I was just the girl to do it.&nbsp;   Today, I got to give a guy I forgot I loathed, a much needed piece of my mind.&nbsp; It felt good.&nbsp; What are they going to do, fire me?&nbsp; I love the ability to take the PCedness out of things without the risk of being fired.&nbsp; It's a lot of fun.&nbsp;   Perhaps I'll have something more profound to say later.&nbsp; Maybe not.

      Well, the time has finally arrived.&nbsp; I will break down and go procure a cell phone today.&nbsp; I've dreaded this day for a long time.&nbsp; So long anonymity.&nbsp;   Last night I arrived home to find Mickey reading a AAA advertisement.&nbsp; He asked if I thought we should get a AAA membership.&nbsp; At first, I thought AAA was for old people, but I think I was thinking of AARP.&nbsp; Whatever, I just knew it had a lot of As.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; he mentioned what all it covered and I said I didn't think it would help me, as I don't have a cell phone.&nbsp; That was not a bitch about not having a cell phone, it was just a statement of fact.&nbsp; I would never use the membership as, if I had to walk to a gas station to make a call to AAA because I ran out of gas, I sure as hell am not just going to walk back to my car from a gas station and wait for AAA to rescue me.&nbsp; So, we debated the pros and cons of getting a cell phone for me (Mickey already has one) and I finally caved.&nbsp; Besides, I'm going to school next semester and if Mom needs to get in touch with me about Collin, she'll have to have a means for contacting me in an emergency.&nbsp; They vibrate anyway.&nbsp; Woo-hoo!  Speaking of going back to school, I'm so glad I'm out of here in a few weeks.&nbsp; I'm not being given any large scale, long term projects to work on at this time for obvious reasons, but just got called upon to help complete the writing of a training manual for a system I know nothing about.&nbsp; Talk about the blind leading the blind.&nbsp; Oh well, it's a paycheck for the rest of my time here.&nbsp; What will drive me crazy before my end here is this chick with the loudass mouth in the office next to mine.&nbsp; Shut the hell up already.&nbsp; She reminds me of MiMi on the Drew Carey show, except her blue eye shadow isn't quite as dramatic as MiMi's and her hair is brown.&nbsp; I can't concentrate effectively with her running her trap non-stop.&nbsp; Actually, speaking of the office, we have quite a mix of people in our department.&nbsp; There's Mimi the loud mouth, there's Petunia the Pig (looks just like Petunia in human form),&nbsp; Marge Simpson's twin sister's missing triplet, complete with bad attitude, cheap cigarettes, fried hair and raspy voice, the 5th Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle (again, looks just like a Ninja Turtle personified, his skin even looks green), and Jaba the Hut.&nbsp; Where are all the pretty people?&nbsp; Help!  I go to the oral surgeon today for a consult on my wisdom teeth.&nbsp; I'm actually amazed I kept up with my referral form this long (nearly a month!) without losing it.&nbsp; I believe that calls for a celebratory ice cream.&nbsp; Maybe not.&nbsp; I'm kind of skeered of going to the surgeon today.&nbsp; They're not even going to be doing anything today and already I feel a big knot in my stomach.&nbsp; Oh well, worse things have happened.

      I started this blog so I could respond to Hooni's messages, but now that I'm in this, it seems like fun.&nbsp; GOD I'M TIRED!&nbsp; I've gotten 8+ hours of sleep the past few nights, but I still feel beat by about 9 AM.&nbsp; I was nodding off at 8 Saturday night.&nbsp; What a loser I am.&nbsp;   I bought school supplies today at Walgreen's, which included some cool, gel pens.&nbsp; I think I would've done better in school had there been gel pens back then.&nbsp; Gel pens make taking notes fun, so many pretty colors.&nbsp; I had a set of gel pens a few years ago that had glitter in them.&nbsp; I remember signing some kind of travel document at the airport in San Salvador and the young woman at the counter freaking about how damn cool my glitter pens were.&nbsp; I gave them to her.&nbsp; They were brand new in America,&nbsp;&nbsp;so by my estimation, I guess they'd hit the markets in El Salvador around 2012.&nbsp; She was more than appreciative and I felt good to do such a good deed.&nbsp;   Anyway, back to the school shopping.&nbsp; I also purchased some 3 subject, college ruled notebooks.&nbsp; I'm picky about the college ruled paper.&nbsp; Wide ruled paper and my handwriting goes to hell, that and I figure I save a few trees by compacting my writing while using college ruled.&nbsp; They also had a neat pencil box that I quickly procured.&nbsp; I think I'm good now.&nbsp; Between this small shopping trip and hording office supplies, I'm doing alright in the school supply department.&nbsp; I even labeled everything with a Sharpie like a dork.&nbsp; I feel like such a Mom..&nbsp; I looked for the Trapper Keepers, but was unsuccessful.&nbsp;   That's all for now.&nbsp;

      This place is even more wacked out than I originally thought.  I was coming out of the women's restroom today, which faces the door to the men's restroom, and there was a sign on the door:  "Candle found.  Please see receptionist."   What?  Why?  Do I want to know?

      So I had my wisdom tooth removed on Friday.  It was alright.  The scariest thing was when the dentist was in my mouth with something sharp poking and prodding at it.  I was scared he'd slip and the sharp instrument would go through my cheek or something.  It was kind of freaky.  Afterwards, I was sent home with a script for an antibiotic and Vicodin.  My tooth continued to bleed like a bitch for a few hours.  It was nasty.  The gauze that I had to shove in my mouth was damned near my gagger and nearly caused me to upchuck in the car en route to the pharmacy.  Anyway, a trip to the pharmacy later, I take my meds and then take another Vicodin before I go to bed.  I wake up a few hours later in a cold sweat, my vision is blurry (couldn't see or distinguish the numbers on the alarm clock),  heaviness in my chest, puking my ass off and I'm itching like a freaky freak.  I called my dentist the next day and they said it was possible that I could be allergic to Vicodin.  Maybe I'm just allergic to not chasing it with a vodka tonic or a few beers, as was done often in college.  Apparently, they were right.  Darvocet did not produce the weird side effects.  Thank God.  I thought I was going crazy.  Mickey has decided that I shouldn't have my other 3 wisdom teeth removed.  Apparently I'm too big of a baby.  They weren't impacted or anything, I only had that one removed because it bothered me immensely.  I felt better on Saturday, so much so that I did yard work all day.  I paid for it Sunday.  My Grandpa said I'd probably get a dry socket from bending over all day picking weeds.  I didn't know being upside down caused dry socket, but so far, so good.  Sorry this was boring, but it's my fucking blog.  :)

      He keeps me endlessly entertained during my last couple of weeks in this corporate hell hole:  A man died and went to heaven. As he stood in front of St. Peter at the Pearly Gates, he saw a huge wall of clocks behind him. He asked, "What are all those clocks?"St. Peter answered, "Those are Lie-Clocks. Everyone on Earth has a Lie-Clock.   Every time you lie the hands on your clock will move.""Oh," said the man, "whose clock is that?" "That's Mother Teresa's. The hands have never moved, indicating that she never told a lie.""Incredible," said the man. "And whose clock is that one?" St. Peter responded, "That's Abraham Lincoln's clock. The hands have moved twice, telling us that Abe told only two lies in his entire life.""Where's John Kerry's clock?" asked the man."Kerry's clock is in Jesus' office. He's using it as a ceiling fan."

      It absolutely boggles my mind how "English" speaking people that talk like shit expect to be taken seriously in a professional workplace.  I'm not insisting upon perfection, but my God, use some proper diction.  Quit slurring all of your words together.  Sometimes I'm embarrassed when I hear how some of the people around here talk, and I'm out of here in about 2 weeks.  Not only that, but this loud ass that sits next to me talks so loud I can hear her through the wall.  STFU.  And her voice is shrill.      I got sent home on Monday for violating the office dress code.  I'd gone to Kohl's this weekend and took advantage of the tax free weekend by dropping a wad of cash on some new, back-to-school clothes.  Capris were recently added back into our dresscode with the stipulation that they have to be no higher than 6 inches from the ground, if you're standing flat footed.  I bought some pretty, magenta colored capris and a cool black shirt.  I thought I looked pretty hip and professional.  I got sent home.  Ruler toting, hem measuring Nazis.  Funny thing was, somehow they thought this was punishment for me.  I got "charged" a vacation day.  OOooooo.  I enjoyed my unexpected day off.  What gets me, is they're worried about the length of capris in August in Texas, yet the restrooms would be what would leave me with the worst impression, should I be a customer visiting this office.  The fronts of the stall doors are black.  I don't think they've ever been washed.  I avoid using the restroom at work if I can help it for this very reason.  It's unsanitary, and unsightly.  On another note, I'm getting one of my wisdom teeth pulled tomorrow.  That's right, one.  They want to pull all 4 of them, but it takes 4 - 6 weeks to get insurance's approval (Aetna).  The one on the lower right is really bothering me,  so they were able to get approval for just that one over the phone.  It's nothing complicated.  They've all erupted, they're straight, they just need to be pulled.  I'm kind of scared, but I figure if I can shoot an 8 pound baby out of my cooter, I'll be fine while they extract a teeny tooth.

      ...and I don't give a footyfuck.  I'm on FIRE.  I was thrown into writing parts of a training manual on a project that, from the start, I indicated I know NOTHING about.  The girl working the project is swamped and I hate her anyway.  So, I get handed this project, and she bitches about what I wrote saying it wasn't complete enough. NEWSFLASH: I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE FUCKING SYSTEM.  So, I just wrote an e-mail to God and everyone about how I would not be helping out on this project, and that I wouldn't buy a cookbook  written by Paris Hilton if my life depended on it, why should someone with no knowledge of something write a TRAINING manual about it.  GMAFB.   I'm beyond pissed.  What an ungrateful bitch.

      Aren't they great?  I could've used another day off, truth be told.  I didn't really do much of anything, aside from hanging out with my guys, going to a playdate at a local water park, and hanging out with my family...  Ah, my family.  My Grandad's 80somethingth birthday was Sunday.  He actually almost died in late June of heart failure.  He flatlined twice en route to the hospital.  It's amazing that he's still here.  He was very different on Sunday.  I'm by no means his favorite grandchild (or if I was, I never felt that way), but he was completely and totally fixated on Collin a good part of our visit.  You could look through the crowd of people and see him on the other side and he'd be looking at him, just smiling, grinning from ear to ear.  It was kind of cute.  My whore cousin was there with her new FOTW (fuck of the week).  I guess that was what he was.  In my mind, she owes me for bringing her several FOTWs ago boy toy to my wedding, saying they were "serious."  Until she found out he didn't have a job.  How serious can you be without KNOWING that someone doesn't have a job?  GMAFB.  My beef with her is not only that she's a total skank, but she's constantly up in Mickey's business when we're around, which I find totally disrespectful.  Mickey gags just thinking about it, so I suppose the upside is getting a good laugh at his faux barfing noises.  Anyway, she was there with her new FOTW, and from what I could gather, his teenage daughter, her boyfriend, and his younger daughter.  Who brings all those people to a first time family meet?  I thought it was pretty bold.  As she does any time Mickey is not there for whatever reason, hunting/working/whatever, she asked where Mickey was.  No greetings to me or anything like that, just a "Where's Mickey?"  Next time, I think I may just reply with an "In my pants, eating my cooter," just for shock value.   I also ordered Collin's first political T-Shirt on Friday.  I can't wait for it to come in.  I think it will be a cool keepsake - a piece of his place in history.  I plan on finding a lot of dated type t-shirts for him and then recycling them into a jersey-knit quilt of sorts when he gets older (I know, high ambitions).  I'd love it if I had a quilt that said "Mondale in '84" and other similar musings.  Wouldn't that be great?
