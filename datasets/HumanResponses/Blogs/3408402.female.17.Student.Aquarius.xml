      Why does everyone always freak out when a girl gets pregnant, everyone always looks disappointed, and they automatically think they know everything because they see a girl under 20 with a big tummy. They stare and make snotty remarks like " omg look at her" or " she shouldn't be pregnant " just things like that are not what a girl needs when she finds out she's pregnant. No one ever thinks a girl is ready, and when i say girl i dont mean 12 year old girls, i mean like 18 or 19 year old girls. I say if someone takes the risk of having sex then they are going to take responsibility of their actions, Girls don't just go and get themselves pregnant, but accidents to happen. Just what is so fucking wrong with having a baby anyway? I am quite aware of the responsibilities that come with a child, but anyone i have ever talked to about it thinks that it is a wonderful experience, but none the less one of the hardest jobs they have ever had, but still one of the most rewarding. I believe all this is true except the part that says " one of the hardest JOBS " I don't think raising my children will ever be a job, you get paid to do a job , i think working and parenting are two very different things. I don't think a person can decide if someone else is ready to have children unless that perticular reason is very noticable such as if the girl is 12 years old, or they have a few years left of school or if they are not emotionally mature enough but even a stranger can't tell the level of someone emotional maturity. I think it should be the person who wants to have a child and the person they are having it with should be the ones to dicuss it amongst eachother and then decide what will happen. So next time you see a girl walking down the street who is pregnant, do not judge her because if you don't already have kids you will be able to look at her and be pround, because you know what it takes to be a mother/parent. If you don't already have children just appretiate what she is doing because it is the biggest responsibility and she is taking it on. So be polite and dont make remarks because everyone needs and wants people's approval and some just don't care.....that would be me by the way. I'm out......

      Today I chose to talk about the elections because they seem to be the topic of choice this week. I don't understand how people can vote for complete strangers to take care of the tax money, say where it goes and where it doesn't go. When I turn 18 I am choosing not to vote because I don't know how you can believe all the promises that these "political icons" make people. How do we know they are going to put more money into our education, or into health care. Since when does EVERYONE all of a sudden care about the education system, us teeagers go to school don't we? Well most of the time we go, but shouldn't kids be able to say whether or not we want more money towards our school system! I don't really give a shit, because when i'm in class I don't pay attention anyway so why am I forced to! Thank god you aren't forced to vote cuz I would prolly just close my eyes and just check one of the damn boxes, the government is still gonna take taxes off of our paychecks so what the fuck is the difference? Either Steve-whatever-his-name-is and Paul-whatcha-ma-call-him? Whoever the hell people chose, they should know....one is them is going to take your money and buy a condo in hawaii whether you like it or not. So you might as well just go ahead and guess who you want to "represent" you. I guess for this one I will keep it short and sweet, this is my first post so lemme know what you think and i will try and keep posting....by the way thanks to tyler for tellin me about this site. Im out....
