      Admittedly I can't quite tell whether people are&nbsp;commenting or not, this is due to the situation I explained in my last post... and such a sad situation it is.  But please... if you wish to comment please continue to do so... because I have a generous, loving, perfect&nbsp;minion that is gonna email me copies of all your wonderful comments be they sparse or in abundance.  *shines at the existence of Blessi*  Actually I haven't asked her yet :P  so, COMMENT... please...

      CONTROL!!!... It is absolutely terrible, and everybody is obsessed with it... everyone wants control. &nbsp; The perfect example is my goddam boarding school... I consider myself moderately&nbsp;lucky that I can get to this page to post on my blog... but I can't actually get to my blog, or anyone elses. &nbsp; *overcome with profound sadness* &nbsp; Oh, plus I can't access hotmail from here... those damn control freaks! It is ALL their fault. &nbsp; So I am terribly sorry but I can't read anyones comments for a little while, or anyone elses blogs. *snif snif*... &nbsp; BUT I WILL POST... just to defy the masses.... POWER TO&nbsp;THE INDIVIDUAL!

      My friends are so depressed I feel the question Of your loneliness Confide... `cause I’ll be on your side You know I will, you know I will &nbsp; X girlfriend called me up Alone and desperate On the prison phone They want... to give her 7 years For being sad &nbsp; Chorus : I love all of you Hurt by the cold So hard and lonely too When you don’t know yourself &nbsp; My friends are so distressed And standing on The brink of emptiness No words... I know of to express This emptiness &nbsp; Chorus : &nbsp; Imagine me taught by tragedy Release is peaceI heard a little girl And what she said Was something beautiful To give... your love No matter what

       hello...   hmm writing it a second time makes it seem weird and kinda pointless.    &nbsp;  I began to scratch my arms 'till they bleed again. I think it must besome kind of nervous reaction. I suppose it is because I am not ready to see some of the people that I am about to see again after the schoolholidays... boarding school sux.   I hate myself for having trusted people, and&nbsp;what's is worst I still trust, and will most likely continue trust forever.   I told him about me in confidence... that was silly, he has betrayed that... he told them all about how I am a "psycho" and how I used to hurt myself. Then he tell's me to go kill myself... and that he is serious... but still expects me to treat him with respect afterwards.FUCK HIM. But I can't, I can't hate him for some reason... life is shit.    &nbsp;  maybe I should die...

      I suppose I should start using my blog for its real purpose... a weblog... not just advertising the things that I love. Where do I begin?  I suppose, as they say: there's no time like the present.  Now is a funny time... I guess I am going through that everpresent phaze in society known as adolescence... I HATE my parents [not only that, but I am so typical, I even think that my hatred for them is justified... haha]. My friends continuously turn their backs on me, making it ever-so-hard to consider them friends... And not only that BUT, I think I am having and identity crisis... yesturday, someone thought I was a butterfy!! and before that someone thought I died of cancer 3 years ago... ... AND I simply don't know who I am.  ~seulement alors volonté vous~ ~comprenez votre individu vrai~

      amidst rush of blood and reptile tears we lie, i with no questions      you with no answers and each day we come, trade roles      change masks become the victim of the crime tracing subconscious designs on each other's skin till mandalas rub raw           and you leave without trust there can be no love when morning certainties       give way to noontime doubts where filament nerves       curl underneath flame and a burgeoning bruise      stains a faded memory, we'll be till nightfall comes, and we rise to die and kill and wake like silk once more ever making regenerating  ...Blessi...

      My trust, so spun-glass thin, so fragile, hold it gently, lest it break. I realise I trust you I trust them - I don’t know how I can’t think when. But this feeling- trepidation yet excitement closed in but free. So simple so hard. Tread softly, don’t wake MY DREAM.  ...Sarah...
