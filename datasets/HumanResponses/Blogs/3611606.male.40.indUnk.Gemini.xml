      I got into it with another Blogger the other day. She, I'm assuming it's a she by the sound of her words, felt that Americans were not appreciating the differences of other cultures and that we assert our dominance around the world, create division and start wars. This is why every other nation in the world is angry at us. If we could only understand the differences of people and even the mind set of terrorists, to actually try to understand them and to seek peace with them, then we would understand how wrong we are and why they feel the way they do about us.   What a load. Why should we attempt to seek peace with those that would harm innocent men, women and children? She simply could not grasp the reality that theirs is a religious war and getting in touch with their feelings would accomplish nothing. They represent evil and destroy innocent people in the name of their religion. This is not to be understood but evil which is to be removed from human kind. Her kind of pacifism is almost as dangerous in this day and age. She did not say whether she was willing to wear a burka for the rest of her life.  I remain an infidel.

      At first this Blog thing seemed like a ridiculous concept. Now it has meaning for some reason. As I read the insightful and meaningless words of others it has become obvious that the best Blogs are those with short posts. I will try and remember this.

      To honor the men and women who fought and died for our freedom, it is important to celebrate this day. There should be flags positioned on every front porch in America's small towns. Visible reminders of who we are and where we came from as a Nation. Freedom comes at a high price, but freedom is worth fighting for. It is not given, it is earned. American's should be proud and thankful to those that gave their lives so we can live in such a wonderful country. But don't forget, we celebrate this day with fireworks made in China.

      This was sent to me the other day. I thought it was worth posting...  "Life should NOT be a journey to the grave with the intention of  arriving safely in an attractive and well preserved body, but rather to  skid in sideways, cigar in one hand, favorite beverage in the other,  body thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and screaming WOO-HOO What a Ride"!!!

      "If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program."  - President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998   "We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country."  - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002   "We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the US Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs."  - Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin (D-MI), Tom Daschle (D-SD), John Kerry (D - MA), and others Oct. 9,1998  "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force-- if necessary-- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security." - John Kerry (D - MA), Oct. 9, 2002
