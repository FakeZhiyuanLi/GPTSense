      I haven't 'blogged' for sometime... aiyah... what to say lah... lazy...  So many things have happen... most importantly... THE HOLIDAYS HAVE ENDED!!! AAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [Most of my Classmates would agree]  I enjoyed every second of the holidays that I spent away from school work... and I've started counting down to the December Holidays...  150 DAYS TO GO... it seem quite less... dunno why?!  well... first day of school was pretty good... had three free blocks... 4 if you add lunch/recess... Tamil is counted as a free block... nothing to do... Miss Kum didn't come for maths... Piriya, Priya, Varsha and I spent time cracking riddles and jokes... ocaasionally laughing at Navene or Fang Xun... Nothing much during chemistry... except that we learnt to blow into water softly... Priya was the only one who didn't learn that at all and kept on "spitting" on my fullscap pad... *hmph*... and we had lunch/recess... adds up to four blocks... not too bad...  I'm still in a holiday mood... CAN'T HELP IT!!! I LOVE HOLIDAYS!!! I LOVE HOME!   *hmph* my parents are asking me to shut down the computer... I'll just update my blogskin before I leave... I want to create blogskins... I did templates on pic. publisher... I want to try html coding and do proper blogskins... I shall check out books next time I go to Woodlands Library... or shall I ask Mr pakisTAN!?  Ok then... See you...  Maybe I'll update in another millenium or two... Oh YESH!!! REMEMBER!!! ALL HAIL RADHIKA!  ok... Bye! Sayonara! Au Revoir! Ya soo! vannakam! Namaste! Bye lah...

         OK!!! I CAN'T HELP MYSELF!!!    I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS SONG OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR THE PAST 3 HOURS!!! Comes from the album Dare to Dream... by... (you must know... if not you are an oaf)... Yanni... Has a folkish and jazzish ring to it... nice and fun... I CAN'T DISCRIBE IT IN WORDS!!! I'm smiling from ear to ear like a goof(think of Ron)... I can't help it... the music makes me!!!    Hence... The power of music... ah...     Well... I know I'm irritating everyone by blabbering about Yanni and Karen Briggs(the violinist in his band)... but I can't help it...     You see... a few people whom I introduced Yanni's music to... (mostly in my house where I played the concert dvds...) Well... these people joined music classes almost afterwards... or bought his CDs the next day... in other words started appreciating music... not just his...     And well... I'm scared that by not introducing and not doing my best... some people may just not get exposure to his music... or to music at all! Cause I CAN'T IMAGINE A LIFE WITHOUT MUSIC... and magic *winks*    Believe me... it makes me smile through out the day... I'm optimistic and I'm stress free... I have to say that music(and magic) played an important part to cause that...   JUST GO NOW AND LISTEN TO MUSIC! I DON"T CARE WHAT TYPE OF MUSIC!     But I prefer melodious music... objectively: not all pop songs nor all classical songs are melodious... It's hard to come by good melody... It's not the simplicity or complexity of the music that matters... It's basically the emotion it can convey... and the melody plays an intricate part... remember this...    Oh yeah! Remember one more thing: I'm a genius *winks*    The only reason why I'm publicising Yanni is that his music is the only one that I have come by which had such a great positive force with me... look!... I joined piano and violin classes soon after I sat down to watch his concert seriously after my PSLE!!!     Oh Yesh... and an important Reminder: I'm a genius *winks*    Yours truley, The genius *winks*...    hogwarts_ambassador

         To all whom I know... spread the news about my blog... I like being famous *winks*... I'm still listening to 'Dare to Dream'... and am listening to the song Nice to Meet You again and again... I like the song Face in the Photograph too...     Guess what? Another reason why I'm a crazy lunatic... I should go to Azkaban... I have done something that shaames me beyond words... but I'll try putting it down in words anyway... YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT...    I went to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban yet again... I had already gone on the first day of the release... *pauses for all to gasp*... well... At least the reason is a good one for me not to slap myself on the face:)     My cousin who is 10years older than me just got married and migrated to Boston. Hence, my cousin's parents, are my only relatives in Singapore! Yesh... you can expect them to hang out a lot with my family now... Well... basically... they weren't free on the first day of the PoA release and dragged me along today when they were going... my mother wasn't accepting my excuse: maana prechanai(tamil for: a screw up to my dignity and integrity... in other words I can't show my face in school)...     But DON'T FRET! I still think it was crap! The dementors still suck and the actors are no better... Tom Felton should retire... AND HARRY DOES NOT CRY! I AM STILL GOING AHEAD WITH MY PLANS TO SUE WARNER BROS.!!! I HATE THEM FOR THAT!... OH YESH!!! I noticed one more screw up... 'Harry' was scared that he was going to be expelled for doing magic: blowing up Aunt Marge right? Well... there is another reason why he should be expelled even if 'Cornelius Fudge' over looked that incident... in the movie, IN THE BEGINNING HE WAS USING HIS WAND TO LIGHT UP AND DO HIS HMWORK!!! HE SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXPELLED!!!... HAHAHA! I CAN DO BETTER DIRECTION!    But truthfully... I believe that this third edition was much more better than the second... which had its last part screwed up... as in... the changes weren't exactly that INSULTING to the books... if you know what I mean... BUT I'LL NEVER FORGIVE THAT ONE MAJOR INSULT TO HARRY!!! I'LL GET MY REVENGE!!! CURSE YOU!!!(I mean the directors, not you... though I secretly mean it at you too *winks*)      ONE DAY HARRY SHALL COME AND KILL ALL OF THEM...AND THEN I SHALL REJOICE!!! :D   *I'm still listening to Dare to Dream*     I have decided on my fav line in the movie:  'Ron': Well, Sirius Black coming after you isn't all so bad... except that he is the first to have broken out of Azkaban... and that he's a murderous raving          lunatic...  'Harry': (sarcastically) Thanks Ron.  PS: The names in the Brackets refer to the imposters: in other words, actors...    Ok then... let's see... how shall I round up this entry??? Oh I know!    - NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY THE MOVIE!!!                                         ~ Remember: I'm a genius... yours truley...                                                                    hogwarts_ambassador

Hmm... what should I type in... I'm lost... Well... this is my first blog(you should know by now)... I am a genius... I love Music(a bit biased - ONLY Yanni's! my msn chatmates can tell you!)... AND HARRY JAMES POTTER(referring to the book and only to the Harry Potter Books) IS MY FUTURE HUSBAND! Oh yesh: I'm a Hogwarts ambassador!     You will by now know my likes... I'm a person with a VERY narrow mind... WHAT I SAY IS RIGHT... and believe me... it BETTER BE! *smiles... I'm a genius*     I'm currently listening to the CD Dare to Dream... by: (You guessed it) Yanni... I'M IN LOVE WITH THE SONG 'NICE TO MEET YOU'!!! SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NICE!!! I recommend everyone to listen to his music... and I beg all those who haven't read all the Harry Potter books to go and make Dobby proud by hitting yourself with a shoe(this goes to Sian Ying too)...     Lemme go and call upon my friends to see this thingy or blog entry or whatever... and get comments!     Oh Yesh... and one more thing that YOU MUST REMEMBER AT ALL COSTS!!!: I'm a genius *smiles, stands up straight, all hail Radhika*    Ok... shall come back sooner than you think: hogwarts_ambassador :D

       National Anthem: Imnos pros tin Eleftherian   With Greek characters:      Σε γνωρίζω από την κόψη,     του σπαθιού την τρομερή,     Σε γνωρίζω από την όψη,     που με βια μετρά[ει] τη[ν] γη.      Απ' τα κόκαλα βγαλμένη,     των Ελλήνων τα ιερά,     Και σαν πρώτα ανδρειωμένη [or -μένοι],     χαίρε, ω χαίρε Ελευθεριά.   Transcribed to Latin characters:      Se gnorízo apó tin kópsi,     tou spathioú tin tromerí,     Se gnorízo apó tin ópsi,     pou me viá metrá[i] ti[n] yi.      Ap' ta kókala vgalméni,     ton Ellínon ta ierá,     Ke san próta andrioméni,     hére, o hére, Eleftheriá!  A loose English translation by Rudyard Kipling (1918):      We knew thee of old,     Oh, divinely restored,     By the lights of thine eyes,     And the light of thy Sword.      From the graves of our slain,     Shall thy valour prevail,     As we greet thee again,     Hail, Liberty! Hail!  A more literal translation:      I shall always recognise you     By the dreadful sword you hold,     As the earth, with searching vision,     You survey, with spirit bold.      'Twas the Greeks of old whose dying     Brought to birth our spirit free.     Now, with ancient valour rising,     Let us hail you, oh Liberty!  YAY! - Ok... I'm just behaving... er... stupidly?  Nah! It's perfectly normal for someone to post the Greek National Anthem in their blog... :D  I'm just filled with euphoria... (Did you know that the word euphoria comes from the GREEK word euphoros?)  *just trying to irritate people*  okok...  Basically this post makes no sense... just like my others :D  Remember: Radhika rules:D:D:D

       OH BOY OH BOY... OH GREECE OH GREECE!!! THE HELLENIC REPUBLIC DID IT!!! SPLENDID MATCH - THEY DESERVE THE TROPHY...    an AMATEUR's REVIEW: ok... basically... this match was totally nerve-wrecking... for me at least... cause I was watching it live... and just couldn't take the anxiety! And come on people... the match was NOT boring... action-packed from the beginning...  Portugal got me VERY worried...   they kept on making advances and had an attacking-spree... they had possesion of the ball 3/4s of the time... and were in Greece's side of the field most of the time... But too bad they couldn't pull through victoriously... the had INNUMERABLE chances... but all went to waste due to nerves I think... and thanks to Greece's defence...  They were man-marked like anything by the Greeks... and after the opening goal... their nerves started taking a toll... all their tries for the equalizer went far too wide... but there was this period of time when Portugal started getting free kick after free kick, corner after corner... *got me VERY worried* But the Greeks didn't let anything get through:D  When the Greeks scored the first goal... I WAS BESIDE MYSELF!!! (and woke up my family members from their deep slumber) The goal was the usual header from Charisteas in the 57th minute... I WAS SCREAMING!!!  Another time when I was beside myself(in laughter)... was when this stupid fan came running through the field, in MID-GAME! He waved a flag that looked like a Portugese one.. and started making a dash for it when this whole HORD of policemen came charging after him... That git was nearing the edge of the field... and waved his hands to applause from the crowd as he was seconds away from an escape! But INSTEAD of running into the stands... the idiot ran into the goal-net(is that what its called?)! *stupid git* got caught! *total nutcase... just when he was abt to escape* *fool* *oaf*   Anyway... at the end of it... I was slightly upset... as the portugese deserved at least 1 goal... the score: 2-1 to Greece would look much better than 1-NIL to Greece... Oh well...   heck... GREECE WON!   I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESUTLS... AND THE FIRST TIME I SUPPORTED A TEAM IN A MATCH... THEY WON!!!   Just proves that after all... Zeus was looking down at the Greeks... *good for them*  Do check out www.euro2004.com/index.html   Oh yesh... and remember one more thing folks... Don't just hail to King Otto... Hail to ME! *winks*  I shall get back to my smiling and exclaims of disbeliefs... :D  Until next time... Radhika the Great (GO GREECE)
