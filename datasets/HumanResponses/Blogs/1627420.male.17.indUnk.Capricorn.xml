       You may be wondering why I have been absent recently. I went to Florida, and not to Orlando or the beaches either.   Day 1 Wednesday: We left at 7:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time, due to having to find a baby sitter for our driver's 3 oldest kids  Day 2 Thursday: We arrived in Citra, Florida at precisely 3:00 AM. I went to bed at 7 AM, woke up at 9:30 AM, and did practically nothing but play on my Game Boy Color and Nintendo 64 (the only 2 civilized equipment I was allowed to bring. We even to haul down our own television, which kept tripping the circuits).  Day 3 Friday: This is when things started to get interesting. Our driver (name not disclosed due to obvious reasons) had outstanding misdeamor arrest warrants in Florida. Someone named Bob reported that he had returned to Florida jurisdiction. Thank the Lord that he was at the grocery store for us. Well, we had to high tail it to Branford, Florida. It took us 3 hours to go on a 1 hour trip since my gramma's car kept breaking down.  Day 4 Saturday: We stayed in Branford, Florida at my gramma's place.  Day 5 Sunday: We left Branford at 11:30 AM EDT and arrived at 4:30 PM EDT back home in Marietta, GA.  Well, that's all folks.  Disclaimer: The above recount is 100% accurate. Full names are not given to protect the not so innocent and innocent alike, since the not so innocent is still fairly innocent as the warrant is for violation of probabation, and he broke it by moving to Marietta, Georgia.

          I absolutely love this French band called Leadspine. Very good band. One of my most favourite songs in the world has to be "We're All Made of Scars" by them.

         Parents mourn India fire victims      How can any self respecting teacher live with that? It's so so sad. I hope those 23 teachers die a very panful death, and soon. Hang them, and while they are hanging and still alive, burn them. I know that's the wrong thing to say, but I truly feel that should happen.

       Ah, I just watched the first ever episode of  urlLink Stargate: Atlantis  on the Sci Fi channel. It was awesome. I loved it. It comes on Friday nights at 9 / 8 Central. You should watch it. Well, how was the first episode? Well, they need to find a person who can naturally control the technology of the ancients. Then, they find that guy in Major Sheppard. Then, the dial Atlantis, and find it abandoned. Well, bla bla bla. You get the point. In the end, it was well worth it. Ya'll just gotta catch the rerun. I only ruined the first couple of minutes of it.

       Today is the wonderful second day of Tinsel, the most rocking Blogging project out there. Well, how is everything going so far? Just wonderful. Oh yes, we are so gonna rock. Well, some news in the world, just for the hell of it:  Iraqi now has a new intelligence agency designed to fight the insurgency of rebellious people within the country, killing both American soldiers, Iraqi police, and other Iraqi citizens. You can read about its creation at both  urlLink CNN  and  urlLink Al-Jazeera.net  (English Edition)  I hope everything goes well for Iraq in the end personally.

       Tinsel is graciously hosted free of charge by XionDigital.net (considering one of the co-founders, myself, owns the place :-D). However, I have exactly 60 days to renew my plan before XionDigital.net (and Tinsel!) goes offline. However, I only need a measly $100, yes that's right, $100, to keep us online for yet another year! If you have some spare money to blow and feel like contributing, please email  urlLink Justin Haygood , and he will let you know how to contribute to the fund. Justin will refuse all donations after the $100 goal is reached.

       Tinsel is a joint blogging project between myself and Justin (jhaygood86). Hopefully this will be a successful venture that will prove to be amusing as all hell. As an introduction I will essentially introduce myself, as I'm sure Justin can speak for himself perfectly well.  You'll most likely be able to tell my posts apart from his easily. First off, I tend to rammble on for great amounts of time about nonconscensical things and my spelling and grammar are horrid.  I also tend to spout band propaganda every five sentences (Go and check out Mae's website:  urlLink http://www.whatismae.com  . It's muchly worth the visit.   There's not really much else to say about me other then my real first name is Meagan, and I also have a livejournal account (  urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/users/porcelain303  )  Yes, that's all for now folks check back again or post your own thoughts and comments. (Just for the records all my posts will end with the following lines)  Smack an ass,  Meagan

      I just got done with my newest creation, the  urlLink NXOnline Advanced Internet Design  website. If you are in the market for a website, a webhost for a website, or a programmer to add brains to a website, please consider using NXOnline.  I'm also trying to thinking of ways to implement this one last thing for my client,  urlLink ClubSoda . Jay, my contact with ClubSoda, asked me to add alot of smarts to the Members Manager I created for his websit. I should start getting to work on that, before we make the switch of the nameservers next week....  Well, until later, cya!

      My friend Jenni has been refusing to talk to me recently. At least I now know (and partially understand) why. She just needed a break so that she wouldn't start hating me. I do understand that's a good reason to stop talking to me, but I still don't know why she got tired with me in the first place.... I'll find out eventually, when she feels like talking with me again.  On a side note.. I am now part of the newly created  urlLink Tinsel Blogging Project !

      I'm bored, really bored. There is absolutely zero things that I can do. Me and mi amiga Jenni talked until like 3 AM the other day (yesterday morning). That was fun. God, is she getting beautiful. Well, she already is a beautiful girl, but she's getting more and more so everyday. I bought her a Boxcar Racer CD for her 16th birthday, even though its several months away (September 9th). My friend Meagan turns 16 soon (July 27th).. Three people I know turning 16!

      Hello Everyone. If you know me, you know that I have been happily using Mandrakelinux Cooker (read: unstable, bleeding edge) for a couple of weeks. I have fallen in love (almost!)  Novell Evolution 1.5  &  Gaim 0.79 . Also, I finally got the nVidia Linux drivers installed. I should of checked their website more often, since they released brand new drivers (mainly to support PCI Express based GeForce cards).
