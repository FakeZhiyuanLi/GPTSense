						   I have some friends who are wanting very much to adopt.  They are great parents with 4 grown biological children.  The problem?  Their ages - 48 and 65 years old!  Solely on thier ages, many adoption agencies won't even do a home study!  This couple is willing to adopt internationally and/or take an infant or young toddler with minor physical needs.  Both are in fine physical condition.  All four of their children are upstanding citizens with (or getting) a college education.    They are currently raising their toddler grandson - so they are very much aware of what it takes to care for a young child.  (This grandson will be going to live with his mom as soon as she is out of college.)  This couple would make fine parents for a good many years yet.  Yes, something could happen to them - something could happen to the 20-something couple down the road too.    Why does our culture look down on it's older generation?  Elders are looked up to in many cultures - but not in America!  Other cultures learn from their elders - in America, we ignore and ridicule them.  The way we treat our older generation is a shame and disgrace on America!  Tori

						   Sometimes I wonder if I even like people!  I belong to several egroups related to different breeds of horses.  With the economy in trouble, there are frequently desperate posts of horses for sale.  Of course the posting person wants to get a fair price for their horse.  They are in financial trouble and really need the money.  Sometimes they are willing to take a low price just to move the horse.  There are a few who have waited too long and the horses are in sad shape - lack of worming, foot care, etc.    It never seems to fail that the people who respond to these posts are not trying to help.  They are choosing instead to criticize and vilify the original poster.  While I also abhor neglect to an animal, I can empathize with a person who makes a mistake.  I can also understand a person in financial trouble wanting a fair price for their animal.    I cannot count the number of posts I have read saying "If you cannot afford to feed and care for your horse, you should give it away".  That is a very idealistic point of view and, if this were a perfect world, perhaps it would be possible.  But I can imagine that someone who is desperate for money - someone who perhaps cannot even afford food for their own table - would be very bitter about having to give something of value away rather than selling it.  And knowing the recipient is likely able to take their time and sell the animal at a nice profit would be salt in the wound.    There are so many people who feel superior and pass judgment on others.  While most times I cannot help these folks either, I do not make arrogant judgments about their character.  There have been a few times when I have tried to help someone down on their luck and been burned for it.  But I would rather have that happen than be the arrogant person looking down their nose at the unfortunates beneath them!    These people take the attitude that the seller has deliberately put themselves in this position.  That the seller is deliberately neglecting these horses.  The people passing judgment are so very superior!   They  would never allow such a thing to happen to themselves.   They  would give all their horses away free first.  Yeah, right!!    Where did the Christian attitude go?  What happened to "judge not lest ye be judged"?  I think I prefer the company of animals to people more every day!!  Tori

						   People just make me so mad!  It seems like everyone wants something for nothing.  (Ok, I know not everyone is like that but I'm sure running into more than my share lately!)    I have a horse advertised for sale.  He is a 2 year old 1/2 Arabian, 1/2 Mustang colt that has an unbelievably nice, quiet disposition.  Ok, he's pretty average in looks - took a bit after the mustang side there.  But he's going to mature about 15.0 hands and he's not a bad looking horse either.  I have him priced fairly low but I'm not giving him away.    I have had so many people inquire about him and then when they see that he's not the dished faced, arched neck Arabian, they are no longer interested.  Ok people, if this boy was the exotic dished faced, arched neck Arabian and also had the great disposition he does, he would  NOT  be selling so cheaply!!  I know he's not a super quality horse and he is priced accordingly.    I have had very nice Arabians for sale and priced accordingly.  No one even inquires because they are too expensive.  Everyone wants the next Nationals winner for $500!!  I am so disgusted with people that I have considered selling every horse I have and moving into the hills as a hermit!    Tori
