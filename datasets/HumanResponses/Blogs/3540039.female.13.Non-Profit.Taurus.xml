      I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair;  I hate the way you drive my car, I hate it when you stare.  I hate your big dumb combat boots,  And the way you read my mind.  I hate you so much it makes me sick;  It even makes me rhyme.  I hate the way you're always right,  I hate it when you lie,  I hate it when you make me laugh;  Even worse when you make me cry.  I hate it that you're not around,  And the fact that you didn't call.  But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you;  Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all.

       [8th graders] : this year was really fun and you guys made it that way. with your guys here i learned a LOT and i really mean it. i learned not to bicker about stupid crap that i'm not even going to care about the next week. i learned to look at the bright side of things. i'm just really gonna miss you guys. some of you guys i met this year, and i feel like i known you my entire life. people talk about how their friends made such an impact on themselves. now i know what they're talking about. this year was extremely hard for me for my own reasons and what you guys did for me meant a lot. i just can't believe that the entire year has gone by so quickly. now there's only about 6 days left and you're off to high school and i really don't want you guys to leave. i just want to be right next to you guys when you're in high school. i guess the reason why i'm so attached to you guys is that i see like a brother/sister figure in you guys. i hope you guys never change when you go to high school because i like you the way you are and i know that you guys are too smart to have high school get to your heads. well, i hope you guys have fun when you go off to high school and i'll see you PHHS people in a year and you Indy people, i wish you guys good luck and K.I.T! you know my sn. haha
