      Hey!! Guess what!? I just found out today what my name means. Hahaha.....I mean... hey, i thought my name was a famous brand of a jeans only. Well, my name (Edwin) was actually originated from Germany and girls were named Edwina. Anyway it means "Prosperous Friend" and no wonder, i have so many friends all around me wheather malay or indian, chinese or sikh.... i always seem to comunicate well with them and i also can comunicate well with people that i've never seen before especially in Friendster. The other meaning is "Heir's Axe" and i'm not quite sure what is the meaning of it...... so for anyone that knows the meaning please drop me a comment. Yeah !!! This is intresting, for 14 years.... i never knew that my name has a meaning........ Ooo yeah!!

      Today i suffered one of my worst game in football, a very painful experience. When a corner was given to my team, i was waiting for the ball, the ball then was kicked. The ball was coming towards me and the defenders were running to it, so without hessitation i ran towards the ball. As i was about to head the ball to the goal, suddenly i felt a sharp pain on my jaw...... then i realise someone kicked me on my jaw, i was stunned for a few moment. After few minutes i started shouting and yellin' to the person that kicked me, all fowl words were coming out of my mouth but my friends chilled me down.  But it wasn't over yet, the pain resumes...... this time it was that person who gets a piece of me. When i got the ball, he tried to defend....getting a chance, i kicked the ball hard with anger towards him expecting to hit his body, but instead it flew hard towards his face. He was lucky the ball did not break his nose, only his lips were cracked. But he did not yell at me, maybe he thinks that it was a repay of what he did earlier. Anyway nothing went wrong after that, we forgave each other and went for a drink to chill out. But this is a painful game as well as a painful experience.

      Day 10 of Olympics and China is still first in the table and although few days ago they trail America by 2 gold medals they now climb back to the top of the table with 1 gold more than America. But maybe it's gonna change soon as the track games has started and America looks strong in Sprinting and Hurdles while China only hopes on the Hammer Throwing event only. Only few more days left and the Olympics will end, we'll have to wait for another 4 more years for the next Olympics in i also don't know where but i know that i'm gonna love it !!!

      Yeah Arsenal !!! I was watching the match yesterday and i got so worried during the match when they were trailing 1-3 to Boro, but Arsenal showed them who was the better team. The determination of Arsenal and Henry in the second half was amazing. Anyway they already matched up Nottingham Forest's record of 42 matches unbeaten already and next week, it's the match that maybe Arsenal can lose. Thay take on Blackburn next week and i certainly hope they win .....even if cannot draw is good enough.

      Yeah !! Day number 8 in Olympics and go go go China, keep on winning medals, eventhough i'm a Malaysian but i'm a chinese and i'll show my support to Malaysia as well as China and Japan. I feel sorry for Malaysia , they are hoping for at least 2 medals for badminton and look what happened ..... they crash out and were not even in the quarter-finals. Now they are hoping on the diving event but i think the chance are against them. Nevermind it .... this Olympics certainly is full of suprises especially in swimming , but i pay more attention in Football .... what to do , i'm a football freak and nothing's gonna change that !!

      You people out there saw how Arsenal dominate the Everton match ?? 1 word for them Congratulations !!! What i can see now is that Reyes is getting better and hopefully gonna be as good as Henry one day. Bergkamp, Reyes, Ljungberg and Pires scored for Arsenal but we musn't forget about Henry ..... he assisted 2 goals. Anyway Arsenal will have to face Boro next week and they have to win or draw to maintain unbeaten.

      Yo !! EPL has just started last Saturday , what can i say.... GO GUNNERS and MU SUCKS!! Yes it's true, i'm an Arsenal fan and would you believe it ?? They made their unbeaten record to 41 matches by thrashing Everton 1-4 away, But they still need 2 matches unbeaten to break Nottingham Forest's record of 43 matches. This season it's the title show down between Arsenal and Chelsea!! Chelsea have a big chance of winning the title this season. MU ? Sorry MU but you are just not good enough..... maybe 3rd or 4th placing would suit you best. I hope Liverpool, Newcastle, Arsenal and Chelsea will kick MU's butt this season. Anyway great timing for the season.... with the Olympics in Athens starting just few days before EPL, it'll stop our boredom. Now i'll be waiting for the start of Serie A and the Spanish La Liga.
