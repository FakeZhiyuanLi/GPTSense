      Hey people !  So we meet again :) After my previous post if you were feeling a bit afraid whether I'll return or not, don't be anymore. I have returned, and am here to stay !  Anyways, since I have nothing really to post, I shall leave you with a small riddle. I liked it a lot when I first solved it. It goes - punctuate the following paragraph to make meaningful sentences - "is is not not not is not is is is is not is not is it not".  Why I posted this ? I don't know. Just remembered it, I don't know why, and thought it is good enough to be shared with you people. Anyways the answer is - "Is is not not. Not is not is. Is is is. Not is not. Is it not ?"! Easy, wasn't it ? :P  Anyways shall be moving now. See you again later !  Ankur.

      It's been a long time that I've been here. The way I am, I don't think I'll be here for some time to come. Hope to be here again sometime in life.  In the meantime enjoy your own lives. I will do something with mine. Farewell.  Ankur.

      How much should one sacrifice ? How does one decide enough is enough ? How does one know that the point has arrived when he has to speak up, when he has to stop thinking about others' feelings and tell them what he really thinks ? Why should one be always the one who compromises to keep things in control ?  What is the point where you stop acting maturely for the sake of the integrity of the group ? How much tolerance must one have ? Obviously, having no tolerance is not good. But is having too much tolerance a weakness too ? Or is it one's strength ? How does one decide that the breaking point has arrived, the threshold has been crossed ? What should be done when you face such a situation ?  Ankur.

      Sometime back in May 2003 I was very low on my spirits and happend to write this thing- one of the only three postings on my previous blog. Just posting it here for my own satisfaction. The questions of our existence, which still remain unanswered to me -  Sometimes in life we get serious, and realize we should have been serious long way back. But I wonder, should anyone get serious at all ? Afterall, it seems we tend to not enjoy the little things which one should in every day life. Or am I overdoing things ? What is the secret to happiness ? Aspire, aim and achieve, or be happy with what one's got ? What do we live for ? What is the final aim ? Is there any ? Is it the satisfaction in cherishing every moment of your life ? Then why cry for something you couldn't achieve instead of being happy within ? Is it so simple ? Or is it out of our comprehension ?  Ankur.

      So there Ladies and Gentlemen,  Thus begins my blog at blogger. This is effectively my second blog page in life. The first one gave real bad service and therefore I'm shifting to this one. Though I rarely visited my blog there, I plan to not do the same here. I have put some fight into making this one comfortable for me and for you, and so I hope that turns out to be the reality in the future.  Blogging is relatively a newer thing to me, I being introduced to this only a few months ago. Then I created one for myself and penned stuff only thrice on it. Initially I planned to shift that stuff here, but then ditched the idea and thought of starting afresh. So people of the world, every boy every girl, here it is. My first serious blog - I, me, myself - live on air, 24/7, whenever you want it, wherever you want it, whyever you want it - ah, but as I like it. So pump up the volume fellas, shake your booty!  And now that we are over with the ritual and threshold of trying to make the amazingly fabulous first posting, and I and you are on good talking terms, you will find more and more stuff here. Whether it'll be good and interesting, I don't know, but I shall keep keep writing anyways! And now that I have made this world a much better place to live in, and your life much more worthwhile to live for, don't let go of the moment! Enjoy it to the fullest and hold your breaths, as..  We shall meet again! Cheers!  Ankur.

      Hello,  Sometime back I was having a chat with one of my juniors (he blogs too), and I happened to mention that I find his blog pretty boring. He said he writes it for himself and not for others. And added that till a while ago he used to write for others and then his blog used to be interesting.  His remark made me ponder 'For whom does a blog exist ?'. Let us first look up the dictionary meaning of the word blog. The dictionary says - ' A blog is a shared on-line journal where people can post diary entries about their personal experiences and hobbies.' Which not at all clears up any sort of confusion! Because it says two things - that a blog is shared and that it is a diary entry - which are absolutely contradictory. One does not share what he/she writes in his/her diary! I never had a diary, but I presume people don't write diaries to share.  But anyways, as I started writing this piece of nonsense, I got it right. One can use a blog for anything. Write for himself or write for others, or not write at all! So whatever you want to do with your blog is upto you, but for God's sake if you tell me that your blog is so and so address, then have something interesting up there :P  See you later,  Ankur.

      I understand you, I completely understand you now O gultis of this world ! I now understand why you are so confused with this national language of ours - Hindi. And I shall try and never scold a gulti now for his wrong usage of this language.   Had this discussion with Aman, Sari and Taxi, and was completely blown over by the simple problems these poor gultis face (Taxi is a  ghati  , by the way!). There is no verb usage for a   thing   in Hindi. While one can make out that  ladka   aaya  and  ladki   gayi , how does one know that  ped   kaata  and  lakdi   giri  ? For those of us who know the language well, it comes very naturally -- kind of a gut feeling. But for them, how do they decide ? What is the rule ? And I was bowled by their simple question.  And to add to it, we associate gender with words of English too, which are used commonly in Hindi. Therefore, how does a gulti know that  bus   chali  and  truck   ruka  ?!   And best is that  ghaas   kaati,  but  baans   kaata !!  Why ?!  Now at least I do not have an answer to it, except that it seems to be a gut feeling due to my close familiarity with the language for all my life. And I think it's fine if those poor souls do not have that gut feeling, as the rule behind it -- I don't know what it is. So my plea to the world is -- please do not scold a poor cute   gulti   who's trying to speak some Hindi !  Anyhow, am gonna find some Hindi stud and ask this to him first thing. It is something good, and I'd like to know that !  So gulti's of the world, rest in peace. Your Hindi is cool. :)  Ankur.

      Ok so I met(saw?) Ayesha Zulka. Big deal.  Back at the passport office yesterday, she was just like any other person. It is Bombay anyways, big deal you saw a movie star. But she is cute. Soo smiley. And pink ! Why do all these stars have to be pink ? She was slightly chubby too. But basic point is -- she is  cute !  And that is the only reason I am posting this - to tell people that she's still the same.  Still same as in her role in  Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander.  So my toll of having a look at lead movie stars now is a paltry low-quality -- three. Them being - Urmila, Priti Zhangiani and Ayesha Zulka. That's it. 5 years in Bombay and this is what I am treated to :(  Anyway, this is so insignificant to even post ! :D And the real story is that after a full file-on-the-table time of 2 years, my passport seems to be nearer to my hands. And I am keeping my fingers crossed. Let's see if my motherland wishes me to go travel seven seas away or not.  Abhi going me. Oh and while I am leaving, I'd like to reiterate - Ayesha Zulka is still soo beautiful !  Bye bye, Ankur.

      I am soo happy..  I, a person who always loved books but never found time to devote to them, has finally started to actually _read_ them than just collect and keep in the rack.  I have read some 9-10 books in the last 3 odd months, and by my standards it's HUGE! I shall get membership to some good liby there in Delhi and read lots and lots more. This will be one of the first few things I wish to do there. Please remind me of it.  Just finished ' urlLink The Good Earth '  (was great)  and now have my hands on ' urlLink Vernon God Little '  (heard it's great too).   Early morning, eating time. Byebye.  Ankur.

      It has dawned upon me very recently that I am keeping this journal alive just to be an active user of blogger.   Brand loyalty   you can say - once they gave me a gmail account, I just feel like not letting them down :D  And so one more post - this one.  Even though blogger has introduced the comments feature, it's still not  most  satisfying. One cannot know when a comment was posted. Also thread system is presently non-existent. The templates too are not very impressive. Blogger still has some way to go before it swooshes past the other blogging sites.  But with google around, I wouldn't think it's far off. Adios.  Ankur.

      It's all new, and better. Good show blogger !  So this is my first posting after the new face of blogger has arrived, and I am happy. All new templates, lots of features, and most of all - commenting on blogger itself. Cool. Though this seemingly brings the existence of Haloscan.com to threats. Also, the comments to my old posts will be lost. But something has to be lost for what there is to be gained.  Blogger rules !  Ankur.

      Hello world,  Well today I will talk about this very bad writing practice people follow, without realizing how annoying it is sometimes. And it is - no use of capital letters, no punctuations, and use of sms language while writing - arghh, annoying !  It is okay to do it once in a while in an email, or on sms - but please not always. I think people just let it be, not giving it much importance. But I, as a reader, tell you today that it is one  big  repulsion and it  is  important.   You may say - I do not think while I write, and I just let my thoughts flow in and post it, as afterall I write the blog for myself ! But dudes, you do the  for myself  things in private postings. And even if not, it is good to let go of your  comfortable  bad practices for your own good _someday_. And that will benefit the reader too ?! And please don't argue that it is not a bad habit !  I think it is fine to make spelling mistakes - ie, that is the one's you do not know of - not the one's you ignore while writing because you just let it be. That's a careless attitude in life. And why not care ? Please ! You are not soo pressed for time, everyone else knows this.  I post this as I do not like reading such material which reflects more of carelessness, and which I read because I have to read that. It's annoying :(  Ankur.

      When I was young my father said 'Son I have something to say' And what he told me I'll never forget Until my dying days  He said son you are a bachelor boy And that's the way to stay Son you'll be a bachelor boy Until your dying days  When I was 16 I fell in love With a girl as sweet as can be But I remembered just in time What my daddy said to me  He said son you are a bachelor boy And that's the way to stay Son you'll be a bachelor boy Until your dying days  As time goes by I probably will Meet a girl and fall in love Then I'll get married have a wife and a child And they'll be my turtle doves  But until then I'll be a bachelor boy And that's the way I'll stay Happy to be a bachelor boy Until my dying days  --   Cliff Richard.

      Finally it is here fellow earthlings, the complete Deja Vu experience!  I have successfully maintained two  great  blogs simultaneously for some time now. I cannot say whether it is better or worse than having just one blog, but it is different for sure. Kills the monotony.  And it was imperative for me to someday post the same posting on this blog of mine and  urlLink the other blog  of mine. And so today is the day.  Why am I making such a fuss about it ? No, I am not making a fuss :P I just wanted to do it someday, and so am very happy that finally am doing it!  The complete Deja Vu!  The Great | The Great

      It's quite a fairytale story. About a month back I had around 30-40 Megabytes of email web space, if I included the 3-4 accounts that I more or less frequently visited, with a couple of them reminding me that I'm getting full. And in just over a month I suddenly have over 2000 Megabytes of space!  Gmail still is in Beta, and is giving login problems. Yet, in the past month it has proved how powerful it is. Rediff has effectively entered the market before Gmail, but seems to have committed the one and only mistake - like the bomb squad guys. Quite frankly, I do not really believe what Rediff claims, they cannot give that much space. And the fact that inbox doesn't even open now on Rediff only produces more smoke around the fire. With Google still in Beta, and even Yahoo just going to 100 Megabytes, I really have reasons to suspect Rediff's claim. And if those claims are false, God knows what happens of Rediff next.  Anyway regardless of what the truth is, the real fact is that the users are in an absolute win-win situation :D I really pity those guys, who over a month back, might have shelled out a few dollars to get around 5-10 Mb more of email-space! :P  Google rocks!  Ankur.

      So here I am (again!), posting after this major revamping of my blog on a cosy, comfortable afternoon/evening, on an extremely pleasant drizzling day.  I have become a see-saw, it seems. Rolling from Blogger to Livejournal and then back, and then back again. Actually the  brand loyalty  thing makes me come back to Blogger time and again :), apart from the fact that Blogger offers the 'as you like it' service. Yet the friends and commenting feature on Livejournal makes me go back.  So there you see, a completely satisfying blogging website still does not exist. While Blogger scores mainly on the  'customization'  part, LJ seemingly banks on  'community blogging'  feature. If either of the two could introduce the feature it lacks, then it's gonna be a sure winner. Apart from that LJ's interface is simpler and slightly faster in comparison.  Only thing I fail to understand is that these features are not too tough to add, considering the fact that they already have such good sites up. So why not just go ahead and fight for it and win back your customers for ever and ever ? I just keep wondering.  So that is that about blogging and me. Yet I desperately pray for one blog-host that gives me all what I want. And I do not want too much ! :D  Ankur.

      So I gave it a thought on what to blog about. Came up with a few things and just discarded them all. Thought could write about what is status quo of my life, and when am I leaving from here and all that. But ditched that as I am mysel fnot sure as I haven't yet got the reservations done.  Then thought would post about how I am feeling in my few last days in here in the insti, and thought that this is such a common theme of blogging, and after so many people having left already before me in te past few weeks, it would just turn out to be another boring account and would say anothing new. So down the drain it went.  Then I got a feel to think of a list of what all would I like to do before going from here once and for all, but then I am leaving in such a hurry that I am not gonna be able to do even a teeny weeny bit of the list, so what's the use of putting up content which in high probability I will have to gripe about later anyways. So swoosh was the sound.  After which I ran out of subjects and enthu to think of more. So I decided I will not post anyways.  Great.
