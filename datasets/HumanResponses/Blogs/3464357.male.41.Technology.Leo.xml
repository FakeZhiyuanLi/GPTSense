      I completed the Ogden Marathon in a PR 3:28:25 (3:27:46 by my watch--the timekeeper apparently gave everyone the same start time).  Keys to achieving this PR were: 1) Speedwork at the local track.  8 miles of 2 mile repeats at 30 seconds slower than 5K pace, with 1 lap rest in between. 2) Plyometrics.  I used the 4 exercises described in Runner's World: bounding, skipping, etc. 3) 23-mile long run.  The longest long training run I've ever done. 4) Marathon race pace band.  This allowed me to focus less on mile-by-mile pace and more on keeping on track for the overall target I set of 3:30:00. Next up: Telford Financial Half Marathon on May 31 in Farmington.

      Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields In sixty-five I was seventeen and running up one-o-one I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on  Running on - running on empty Running on - running blind Running on - running into the sun But I'm running behind  Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive In sixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on  Running on - running on empty Running on - running blind Running on - running into the sun But I'm running behind  Everyone I know, everywhere I go People need some reason to believe I don't know about anyone but me If it takes all night, that'll be all right If I can get you to smile before I leave  Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels I look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through Looking into their eyes I see them running too  Running on - running on empty Running on - running blind Running on - running into the sun But I'm running behind  Honey you really tempt me You know the way you look so kind I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find Running into the sun but I'm running behind  (c) 1977 SWALLOW TURN MUSIC

       Telford Financial Memorial Day Half Marathon  I completed the 1st Annual Telford Financial Memorial Day Half Marathon with a PR 1:43:45.  My goal was 1:40, but considering my effort a week earlier in the Ogden Marathon, I wasn't disappointed in the results.  The course was fun, although the first 3 miles were a little buggy.  The race began on the dike at Farmington Bay.  Mile 3 was just inside the bird refuge, and once we got past the gate to the refuge and were on blacktop road, the bug population declined, the surface became smoother, and we were no longer running into the sun.  The route is a familiar one to me--I frequently do training runs through west Farmington and Kaysville.  The temperature was good, low 60's, with a cool breeze from the north.  The aid stations were well-manned and had plenty of drinks, and there was ample food at the end.

      For Father's Day 2004 my wife bought a new wedding band for me.  I've already lost 2 wedding bands, the last one on a long run.  I thanked her for the new one, then suggested an alternative (this is not romantic, but it was Father's Day, not Valentine's Day).  I suggested that I would really rather have a Garmin Forerunner 201, a wristband-mounted GPS unit that is ideal for long-distance runners.  She agreed to my proposal on the condition that I let everyone know that the Garmin unit on my wrist was my wedding band.  I agreed.  She returned the wedding band and I bought the Forerunner.  I've worn it now on a half dozen runs.  It is the greatest running accessory I've ever had.  I love it.  And I love the woman who gave it to me.  I think of her every time I wear it.

      I finished my first Wahsatch Steeplechase, a 17-mile trail run up City Creek Canyon to the peak of Black Mt., then down again, on Saturday, June 19th.  The uphill part was steep, but with the early start time and cool weather, I felt great.  Things got a little hairy at the top, where the trail is narrow and there are large, sharp rocks to navigate over and around.  The downhill was hellish.  A fast, narrow trail with many switchbacks, overgrown with roots and made even worse by rocks.  I tried to keep up with the fast-moving crowd coming downhill, but after wiping out 2 or 3 times, I slowed my pace considerably and let the mountain goats pass me by.  I finished in 3:21.  My calves and quads were hammered worse than any other race I've done.  I finished 84th in the Men's division.
