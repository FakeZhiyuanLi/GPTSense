        desi kerry no doubt comes from my last night experience of eating chicken curry and flipping through&nbsp; CNN and MSNBC trying to watch simultaneously aired programs about John Curry, oh John Kerry. Well watching in was enough to provoke me to believe that my leaning towards John Kerry is not just a huge dislike for the utterly uninspiring figure G. W. Bush is (btw, the W stands for women as one Bush campaign ad would have, how lame) I like people to&nbsp;have the talent, courage and will to make an idea&nbsp;a reality. Kerry did exactly that. Decorated war veteran (actually just 4 months of service, did he take steriods or something, sure broke some records there) comes back to the United States to settle a score with the almighty President Nixon who decided putting an entire generation through a free fire zones was justified so he wouldn't be the first president to lose a war. How generous. Well, Kerry had a lovely gift for Nixon. A dip in approval ratings. Now that is something of a crisis specially when Kerry is getting more airtime than Nixon could digest. He promptly decorated some soldiers posthumusly and thanked them for their patriotism proving he loved war vets only if they were dead. The ones alive and back in America (lost limbs and body parts notwithstanding) were doing a huge disservice by supporting the anti war movement and throwing away their medals which the dead folks had not option but to keep. Well all said and done, Kerry did a good job of articulating and leading a movement and giving it his voice. People would blame it on political ambition -&nbsp;He is very ambitious - wow wasn't that what&nbsp;america was fighting in vietnam for.&nbsp;Capitalism versus communism, human ambition and enterprise&nbsp;against obesequity and&nbsp;faceless existence. I&nbsp;just wish Kerry had been as radical a politician as&nbsp;he was in his formative years. I wonder why i had never heard about him till before the democratic&nbsp;nominee elections.&nbsp;I wonder how G.W. Bush will&nbsp;have the&nbsp;conviction&nbsp;when&nbsp;he argues Kerry about&nbsp;justification for war in iraq and&nbsp;thousands of lives lost.&nbsp;Who will believe in his&nbsp;ineffectualy delivered prepared speeches ? I can't wait for an unorchestrated debate. Yeah Kerry and curry for me. Till&nbsp;November&nbsp;! I&nbsp;hope i don't have to switch to&nbsp;Texas Pete. That's a killer.&nbsp;

        I want this blog to reflect myself. Often i have felt what would it be like if i could walk out of myself and observe my person as an outsider,&nbsp; who knows myself fully&nbsp;but does not influence how i think and act. Probably making a note of my thoughts for some time and then reading them at a later point will let me do this. I am confused that my intention in doing this is my concern about how i appear to others or my own dissatisfcation with the way i have been living. I need a sea change in my life. Schedules, anxiety, self deprecation, a lack of drive towards work every thing bothers me. I try to cheer myself one moment and then criticize every little thing i do.&nbsp;Do i over analyse myself ? I wonder if it is justified. I think it is because i have not lived up to my own ambitions. Why do i struggle between my deep seated desire to achieve and a lack of will to put my desires into action. I want to be angry with myself. Anything that will shake me from this inertia of inaction. I live in a world that seems to be darkening around me. I feel depressed and pessimistic about what i will achieve. I have a burning desire to prove myself. I want to congratulate myself for a job well done, be a stern judge of myself and earn the self praise. It's not split personality, i am not feeble, i hold all the strings to my thoughts and my actions. I want to weave them together into one strong and vibrant fabric. I want to create, solve and rejoice. Thats the promise i make to myself now. I'll be happy by the end of the day and will have reasons to be so.
