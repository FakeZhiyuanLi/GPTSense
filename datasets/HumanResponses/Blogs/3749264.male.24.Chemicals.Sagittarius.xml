       So I returned from Japan on June 20 after spending 2 weeks over ther learning about my company.  Talk about a new experience...  First, I went with a guy who speaks some limited Japanese - he live there for 6 months and was given immersion lession every day.  Thanks to him, I wasn't completely on my own.  But even when you are over there with one person who speaks english, you start to speak in simple sentences.  So Drew and I were dropping words evne when talking to each other.  Being over there was great.  The food was completely different from over here.  Breakfast looked like most other meals to them: some sort of sushi or fish, miso soup, an egg (not like american egg, they have fluffy layered sweet eggs at most meals), rice, and a pickle salad.  Lunch was whatever you wanted: Ramen, Soba, Okonomiaki (shredded cabbage, meat, sweet sauce, spicy mayo fried like a pancake on a griddle - delicious), Curry (they have CoCo Ichiban like we have IHOP), or any number of small resturaunts.  You pick what you want to eat by walking around and looking at the display cases in front of each restuaunt.  The food there was usually very good.  There are several flavors that are common, while prominent, they tend to enhance the food and not overpower what you are eating.  Because of that, you don't get tired of the sauces.  Dinners were many different things... We had a lot of Yakiniku - plates of raw meat that you cook over a charcoal grill at the table, lots of sashimi (I like it better than sushi), yakitori (chicken on a stick), and my favorite meal of all Kobe style beef.  Kobe beef is beef that was raised on beer and massaged every day.  The result is a fatty, incredibly marbled beef that has the smoothesttexture and best taste ever.  One little peice of this was better than any steak I had ever had.  Of course, it is served raw.  We dipped it in soy with lemon, garlic, and jalepenos.  Unfortunatley, it was also the most expensive dinner we had.  Even though I love American food and missed it by the end of my two weeks, I would love some authentic Japanese food in America.  While I was over there, I got to do some limited sightseeing.  I went to the top of Tokyo tower (slightly higher than the Eiffel Tower).  From up there, all you can see it city to the horizion.  It made me appreciate how large Tokyo was, and how lucky Americans are to have such space.  The cities in Japan are packed with people, since only 20% of the land supports population (the rest is mountain) the  density of people is staggering.  The Tokyo subway was the biggest example of this, besides being a huge spiderweb of subway and rail lines - the public transportation system in Japan is MASSIVE.  If a train is full (forget getting a seat on the train during commuting hours - standing is typically full) people will back into the car, forcing those already in the train to get a little closer together, and make it far enough inside that they don't lose their nose as the door closes.  It has gotten so bad on the subway cars that there are specific - women only cars during the busy times.  This prevents dirty guys from taking advantage of the too-close conditions - which has apparently been a problem.  This isn't helped by the fact that short skirts are pretty common over there.  I was definatley most unhappy while I was riding the subway with wy 2 weeks of luggage during the bust times.  In Tokyo there is an international section of town - around Roppongi tower.  This area is packed at night with Japanese, American ex-pats, South African, European, and I am sure pretty much anything else.  We were warned to stay away from certain establishments advertised by urban-americans... they tend to be EXTREMELY expensive.  The night we went out in Roppongi, we went to a 70s band bar.  We walk in and order songs off a menu that a japanese cover band gets up and plays.  The lead singer looked like Japans versio of Ozzy Osbourne.  The band was actually pretty good, and our waitress did a great Janis Joplin.  After Tokyo, we went to Nagoya for more business stuff.  On our day off we got to go to the Nagoya port (Nagoya ko).  They have an aquarium similar to the Tennessee aquarium in chattanooga, except this one had an Orca and Dolphin show similar to Sea World.  It was a pretty interesting time.  I couldn't help but think of all the fish I saw as being my dinner for the last few nights... I am fairly certain I had eaten a few of the types of fish we saw that day.  We also saw a Japanese cruise ship dock from some sort of trip.  I guess it was a disney cruise because is the M-I-C-K-E-Y song blaring in non-english... some things don't need translation.  For lunch at the port we found an oasis of western culture... Jerry's Uno was a taco joint that had american beer and reasonable approximations of tacos.  I had one beef and one fish taco that both tasted great.  Also in Nagoya, we visited a Japanese temple.  Around the temple were many smalls hops in all 4 directions leading up to the temple.  Here is where I did a lot of my souvenier shopping.  Of course, no where took credit cards - something I was completely caught off guard by.  They are still very much a cash-oriented culture over there.  The temple was nice, you walk up under a giant arch, guarded by two fierce warrior/demon statues.  Then you pass by a big pot of insence - blessed to drive out evil spirits and sickness from your body and to bring you luck.  As you walk into the temple, you have many people around you gathered in front of the viewing area.  There is a collection pit to throw a hundred yen into, and a gong that you hit with a rope before you pray.  Indise the viewing area are elaborate gold statues, fresh flowers, and a monk praying also.  It was an island of extravagance amid beautiful eastern architecture.  The inner temple was gold, and white, and light wood while the outside and whole outer temple area was red, some green accents, and a dark wood.  As you leave the inner temple area, there is a place to donate 200 yen and receive a fortune.  If you like the fortune, you keep it; if it is a bad fortune, you tie it to a giant lantern hanging over the insence pot to cleanse it from your spirit.  My fortune was just "ok".  How it was translated seemed to fit into my life and persona well - so I kept it.  But it wasn't one of the great ones.  One of the last towns we visited was Hyuga.  Hyuga is a small town on the southern island of Kyushu.  Our biggest technical center in the company is located here.  During the day we got to travel around a see some of the landsacpe.  Since this is an island, there are many amazing places to see.  There were many rocky beaches.  The mountains stay green and go right out into the ocean in some areas.  It was similar to pictures I had seen of Hawaii, but in the valleys in Hyuga are houses and such.  I really regret not having a camera on me.  The scenery was so picturesque, and I really can't put the beauty into words...but the camera wouldn't do it justice either.  Also in Hyuga, on the top of Kushi mountain was a Bhuddist shrine called Bu Shari Tou.  This was a white obelisk like temple with statues of Bhudda in various positions.  There were statues in each cardinal direction, and a giant statue on top.  Being on the top of a mountain, at a temple, with ocean on 3 sides, and overlooking the rest of the island was definatley moving.  There is said to be a bone of Bhudda buried within the center of the temple.  It would be an appropriate place for an important artifact merely by the beauty and serenity of the location.  That was one thing about the temples I visited... They don't inspire awe in the same manner as the cathedrals I have been to.  They are definatley holy locations, and you do experience a sense of power from them.  It is a differnent feeling, there is a serenity and connection to everything that was inspired in me.  The sense of power and awe are also in Christian cathedrals, but they are slightly different in the way they are inspired...  Well thats pretty much it.  I spent 2 weeks in immersed in a much different culture.  The experience was one I will never forget.  I hope to go back, and bring Katie with me.  But probably not until I can learn more Japanese... Ordering food and drink is about the extent of my language skills right now.  It will be a long while before I spend another 16 hours on a plane... even longer before I watch Welcome to Mooseport again (thank you ANA for showing the exact same 4 movies going to and coming from Japan)...  Next week I got to another foreign country... CANADA!  Fortunatley, its America lite - I should fit in just fine.

       Well, I should be writing a report for work on my 2 week trip to Japan... so what do I do? I create a place to write about my trips everywhere online to keep from writing for my boss(es).  Way to go, Ed.  Apparently, my procrastination skills are getting a bit dusty from college.  I should be able to find something completely different from what I am supposed to be doing...  but no.  Today I decide to do something just slightly not what I should be doing.  So Hello there! This is my blog.  I don't know what it will be, if I will be funny, informative, or a complete waste of time (100 bucks says it will be the last one).  To put my future writings in context for those who don't know anything about me:  Name: Ed Home: Raleigh, NC Age: 24 Marital Status: Single, but hopelessly in love with a girl I have been dating for 6 years.  We'll call her Katie. Occupation: Sales guy for a japanese silica gel maker What the hell is Silica gel: Processed sand - used for humidity control, beer filtration, cosmetic filler, toothpaste filler, paint flatting, plastic property modifier, pharmaceutical raw material, and fodder for dumb white powder jokes. Hobbies: None right now, but I used to play Saxophone, water ski, play Everquest (quit due to sucking my life away).  Now I mostly go to work, travel a lot, and spend my time with Katie.  Oh well, thats it for now.  Will try to keep this up to date and pass it along to friends.

       Last week I went to visit a friend in Seattle, WA.  I had a hotel on 3rd st downtown (nothing fancy - as we must always keep our hotels under $100 a night).  We spent the day walking around the city.  Across from the Mariner's stadium was a brewery/pub called Pyramid.  They had an Apricot Wheat that was very good.  That night, after my friend met up with me, we went out to Elliot's (resturaunt on Elliot Bay) and all had a linguine with mussels (caught hours before) and pesto that was very good.  All that you hear about Seattle having great coffee is true... I enjoyed a great latte every morning at the coffee house in the lobby of our hotel.  After 1 day in Seattle, we drove the 3 hours to Vancouver, BC.  It seems that each city you visit has a specific detail that makes it memorable or beautiful... Seattle has the waterfront.  Vancouver had mountains in the distance.  The weather was mild and clear while we were there, so we spent most of our free time walking around.  Vancouver has a large range of mountains about 30 minutes away by car.  Whistler moountain is supposedly some of the best skiing in the world.  I wouldn't know though. Despite several trips to Colorado in the winter, I have yet to go snow skiing.  Canada seems to be a good place to visit based on what I saw.  The prices over there seem equal to what we would have in the US, but when you get home and look at your bank statement, you get a pleasant suprise.  The currency exchange basically gives you a 25% discount on everything you bought.  Thats about all I have, nothing terribly interesting happened on that trip, just a standard business trip to a place I have never been to.  Until next time... -Ed
