      This weekend was hectic, to say the least.  Work, niece's graduation party, travel, family reunion, drink, eat, sleep, work.  I believe my tolerance for stupid coworkers has reached its limit.  Most of the people I work with are fine, although a select few have now tried my patience.  Drama, backstabbing, and laziness.  What else would you expect from Crack Mart?  I have the [pa] rents' house to myself for a few days.  My stepfather had to travel to St. Louis for surgery, so it's just me and Sassy, our cocker spaniel puppy.  When I was younger, this would have been prime party time.  And now, all I feel like doing is lounging in my boxers.  Ahhhh, R & R :)

      My birthday was Sunday, and I'm finding out that birthdays are not what they used to be.  It was still cool, I suppose, I did the family thing and whatnot.  It just didn't seem all that special.  Mother got me a shirt and some jeans.  The jeans were nice, and the shirt would have been, but the color was just wrong.  The tag said "orange" and she knows I like orange, but this shirt was more peach than orange.  And, well, I'm not going to wear a peach-colored shirt.  It's against my religion or something.  Father had a cookout for that part of the family, since there are so many May birthdays.  That was nice, seeing as how I won't see him again for a few months.  That's the way it's been, and the way it will be.  I got one phone call from a person not in the family, although she might as well be.  My girlfriend called me, thankfully, it made my day.  I counted three people who called on Monday, so I guess they get some kind of credit.  Current musical flavor:  Nelly

      I went out last night, just sat with my friend Johnny as he checked IDs at the front door to a bar.  Yeah, that's how much this birthday weekend sucked.    Afterwards, we went to the only place still open, this little club in Illinois called The Purple Crackle.  I'm pretty sure the only reason the Crackle is still open is, well, because dumbasses like me are willing to pay a $5 cover to drink $3 cans of beer.  You see, Missouri's liquor laws state that alcohol cannot be sold after 1:30 AM, while Illinois can sell 24/7.   The clientele at the Crackle is, for the most part, shady.  Once every three months, some one does something to piss off all the "African-Americans" who then beat the crap out of the "non-African-Americans."  It's funny, really.  The best part is when people get stabbed, or even shot.  Their bouncers get the shit beat out of them, they get pissed at everyone, and what for?  It's their fault, really.  I mean, you can't avoid trouble in a place like that, but don't get snippy with me because you can't hold your own.  I got the metal detector, the mean glare from the ID guy, and the laugh from the money man when he was taking my $5.  The laugh suggested I was a sucker, and indeed, I was.  And the take from the owners?  They don't care.  When a fight breaks out, they change the music from Top 40 to classic rock and turn more lights on.  It stays that way for a couple of weeks, then they go back to the old style again.  They make their money, left and right.  I'm sure they've made enough to pay for that place a hundred times over.  The saddest thing is, there will never be competition for the Crackle.  Never.  That ensures that suckers like me will keep paying $5 to enter a place playing music that faded out three years ago, drinking $3 cans of beer while trying to not upset the dark crowd.  Bullshit.  But we keep doing it, nonetheless.

      I got to see my daughter this morning, and it made my day!  She's two weeks old now, so there's not a lot in the way of action.  That's not to say I don't love every minute of it, because I do.  It's been a rollercoaster of feelings, parenthood has.  I tell myself to take things a day at a time, which used to be easy.  I am so concerned for her future, though, and find myself thinking way too far ahead.  I suppose I'm worrying about things I shouldn't worry about now.  I just want to be the best father I can be.  And, so, I will admit that I get a bit caught up when I look into her eyes.  It's amazing how some one so little can bring a grown man to his knees.  Pass the Kleenex, please.

      I've been feeling lonely lately, but not for a lack of company.  Plenty of people are around, just not the right ones.  The days are getting so long, and there are times I feel so...out of touch.  My birthday is Sunday, although I don't have any plans.  I would love to spend time with my other half, but she's 4 hours away, and I'm not sure when I'll get to see her.  I feel like inviting my friends out, but I don't want to be the selfish one who asks others to throw a party for me.  Besides, shouldn't my friends remember my birthday, without me having to say a word?  And so, this week trudges on, with not much to look forward to.

      I have been picking up extra hours at the gas station since I lost my main job, although not every shift is the same.  The store manager has managed to come up with what I call "grunt work."  That is, really dirty stuff.  I spent most of five hours today scrubbing our 16 fuel pumps.  If that doesn't spell fun, I don't know what does.  In all honesty, it was a good break from the norm!  And, looking on the bright side, it was a bright day.  I mean, the sun was out and whatnot.  I guess that kind of makes up for the fact I was up to my elbows in gasoline and grease.  Dirty.  My coworkers have termed the store "Crack Mart" in honor of the seemingly drugged-up regulars we get.  It's ridiculous, the behavior of some people in this world.  Of course, if you ever had thoughts that rudeness didn't exist any more, I urge you to go work a day in a gas station.  I find myself wondering how it is that these idiots find their way to work in the morning, not to mention how they still have money left over after satisfying their crack addictions.  I'm sober, but broke; I'm at least halfway intelligent, and get fired for unknown reasons.  What's wrong here?

      Wow, what a hectic month it's been.  I feel as though I can't get enough sleep, and even my sleep doesn't feel like sleep any more.  I struggle through dead hours, trying to make sense of the visions I have during "rest."  I wake myself in mid-sentence, and try to find the ending without knowing what the beginning was.  Everything is surreal, and everything is blending.  This life has become a constant blur.  Current musical flavor: The Chemical Brothers.

      What a hectic time it has been lately.  So much going on, so few painkillers...  In the last month, I have gained a new car and a new child.  I was feeling good about these things, until I lost my main job yesterday.  I'm lucky to have a part-time job to fall back on, but still...perfect timing from the asses at that company!  I was finishing up my duties around 7:00 AM, when Mr. Boss showed up and decided to fire me because of "productivity reasons."  Dude wouldn't even tell me exactly what "productivity reasons" he had a problem with, just shouted at me to leave.  After more than 6 months on a job, I should think I deserve a concrete reason for my termination.  So, until I get that, we will just refer to the loss of my job as "laid off."  All truth be known, the company in question was losing work contracts in other areas of the plant, so it wouldn't surprise me to know that I was simply no longer needed.  Still...  So yeah, I'm excited about being a father.  My daughter's mother and I are not together, per se, but we are both being cooperative and cordial.  Our child does not need parents who bicker over trivial matters, as we do not need to put her through that.  My stepfather had to travel to St. Louis this morning for exams by more qualified doctors...he contracted a parasite while trout fishing at Montauk State Park, and soon thereafter became jaundiced.  The latest news is a blockage of the pancreas, possibly cancerous.  My mom is beside herself, and I can see why.  There is so much going on, and so few painkillers.

      It's that time of the week again, time to mow the lawn.  In all honesty, it could go a few more days.  The only thing that sticks out is this one small patch of grass; for some reason, it grows at three times the speed of the rest of the lawn.  It bugs me when things are asymetrical!

      I've been a bit under the weather the last few days, some kind of sinus problem.  It's not like my body ached, but my head was killing me.  I think the sickness ended today with a 5-hour headache, though.  I had to go to the DR a few months ago for an infection of my navel.  No idea how that happened, and the DR wouldn't tell me...just prescribed some antibiotics to make it go away.  Well, it's back, and this time I have no health insurance.  It's f*cking great, I tell ya, not knowing how you're supposed to get well when you have no money to get fixed.  Headed back to bed now, my crackhead manager has me working morning shifts all weekend.  Current musical flavor:  Paul Oakenfold

       urlLink    This is Short Angry Balding Man.  He visits Crack Mart at least once a day, and buys things such as cigarettes and beverages.  He never seems to be in a good mood...of course, I'd be upset if I was short and balding, too.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    I spent more than two hours sketching this logo for a friend's band, CG3.  I showed it to him several times, seeking approval.  After I finished, I could tell he didn't like it.  "It's not a bad design," he said, "but it's too complicated.  I liked it more in previous designs."  *sigh*&nbsp; urlLink

      A friend of mine at work asked me where I banked at.  Ha!  Like I have money for a bank to hold for me!  Yeah, that would have been funny, if I was joking.  *sigh*  I'm growing tired of not having money.  I had to borrow $20 until payday, just to get gasoline.  How ironic, I work at a gas station, and can't afford gas.  Still waiting for the next f*cker with an SUV and a bank account to complain about fuel costs.  Going to my stepsister's house this evening, supposed to be some massive birthday party.  It seems 85% of that family has a birthday in May or within 2 days of it.  I'm like "whatever" because all I want is some food.  BBQ'd meat of any kind.  Maybe I'll get lucky and dad will spot me some beer, too.  Three days to payday, I'm almost there.  This is f*cking pathetic, but I still have it good.  I may be broke, but I'm not broken.

      I resumed my search for a full-time job today.  I actually have a full-time job, but to think working at Crack Mart is going to keep paying my bills is futile.  Any more, it takes every last bit of effort for me to get dressed and go fill out applications.  It's just so depressing, the job market here.  I would feel better about it, too, if I knew I was getting into something I liked.  However, I'm the stubborn one who didn't further my education, so I have to settle for whatever I get.  That's what makes all of this seem pointless.  Perhaps I'll sell the naming rights to my blog for millions of dollars (insert insane laughter here) .  I'm getting good at making mental notes of things I will lecture my children about...more on that later.

      Last night was simply a blast.  I attended a bachelor party, of sorts, at my friend's parents' house.  Craziness ensued.  The bonfire was raging and the pool was warm; guitar melodies were sweet and the drinks were cold.  I really did enjoy my time, although I could have gone without falling over in the bed of a truck.  I also could have gone without throwing up, but sometimes things get that way.  Congratulations to Ryan and Emily, I wish you the best of times throughout your lives.

      The second interview with the distribution center went so well, they offered me a position.&nbsp; All I have to do is pass a background check and drug screen.&nbsp; I hope my history of being a heavily-armed druglord doesn't factor into that equation :)  And, so, my last day at Crack Mart is tomorrow.&nbsp; I will have to remember to take Kleenex along for the tear-jerking moments.&nbsp; I'm going to miss so many things about Crack Mart:   The drive-through window.&nbsp; Without the customers asking me to run across the store and grab their twelve-packs of cold Crack Juice, I'm never going to get any exercise.  The Crack Heads.&nbsp; So much crack, so few people to keep the industry alive.&nbsp; At least they made me look like Einstein.&nbsp; No more  urlLink SAB-Man  stories!  The coworkers.&nbsp; I'll probably always have coworkers, although they won't always be the quality type like  urlLink Five-O .  The restrooms.&nbsp; Guys are disgusting when it comes to bathroom etiquette.&nbsp; I guess some people think relieving themselves on walls and flinging nasal discharges on mirrors are manly acts.&nbsp; Hit the hole, for crying out loud.  &nbsp;The drama.&nbsp; It would be a crying shame if everyone got along.   I have&nbsp;one full day left in Cape Girardeau, MO.&nbsp; It hasn't even begun to sink in, but you can rest assured I'm not upset about it!&nbsp; I've been busy packing the last three days and have so much more to do.&nbsp; I've been known to procrastinate and put myself under immense pressure to get things done, and this time is no different.  I'm anxious and excited, impatient and nervous.&nbsp; Wednesday, things change. &nbsp;

      I traveled to Columbia (MO) again yesterday, or close to it, anyways.  I had scheduled an interview for a massive distribution center position, and an interview for a fallback job at a truck stop.  On my way there, I received a call from another company I had interviewed with before.  The Human Resources lady had an offer sheet ready for me to sign, so I detoured to their headquarters to sign off.  I also scheduled a physical and drug screen for next week.  The interview for the distribution center went well, and I scheduled a second interview on Thursday of next week.  I like the hours more, and the position is more my type than the other.  The starting rate of pay and benefits are so similar that they don't make a difference in my decision.  As for the fallback job, it's bad.  Supposedly, I'm already hired, although I can tell you I hope I never go back to that place.  Nothing against the people who frequent truck stops, nor the people who choose to work there; it's just not for me.  Moving in less than two weeks, full time job or not...

      I just finished talking with my ex-girl, my daughter's mother.  We exchanged what may be best described as the usual "howyadoin" kind of questions and answers.  I had not talked to her in over a week...  I've been feeling a bit inadequate lately, the result of too many financial obligations and not enough finances to cover my ass.  There are things that need to be paid for, including (but not limited to): car, insurance, child, phone, food...the list goes on.  Not  that  much farther, but it goes on, nonetheless.  My full-time employment at Crack Mart is simply not enough to make ends meet.  This is the result of falling into a hole filled with dead-end jobs and lackluster performance.  The result of starting to climb the proverbial ladder, only to have the company supplying the ladder kick me back to the bottom of the hole.  The result of a dreamer who decided to sleep a few minutes too long.  It's difficult to call my child's mother, knowing part of my obligations are to both she and our daughter.  I realize money is not everything; I also need to be the father my daughter needs in her life.  I want so desperately to be that man, not just half of that man.  These times will pass, and there's no doubt that things are getting better.  I'm staying positive and keeping my chin up.  It's easier to see the sun that way.

      I can't really say how loud you have to get to make a stupid person hear you, but I can say I got that loud yesterday.  I work with this girl we call "Five-O."  She got that nickname when police showed up at work and questioned her about thieving some goods from a place where thievable goods are sold.  It turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, but the nickname stuck.  We have a drive-through window at Crack Mart.  Anyone who drives can pull up and get what they want through the window.  Well, almost anything they want.  As long as we sell it, and they are of age.  The majority of people who use the window are simply looking to get a fountain drink, and maybe a pack of smokes.  I don't have a problem with such customers.  Then, there are the ones who want to give you a shopping list and have you run around the store.  I do have a problem with these customers.  Granted, some people are physically disabled, which I can understand.   Five-O is not physically disabled, although mental aspects are questionable.   And, so, when she pulled to the window yesterday and requested a 12-pack of beer, I became a bit frustrated.  Here it was, rush hour on Saturday.  I had 6 paying customers waiting in line on the inside of the store, and one of our employees wanted to waste  their  time instead of getting off  her  ass.   What nerve!   I returned to the customers on the inside, and ignored her.  She walked into work twenty minutes later.  I gave her the burning glare of death as she waddled into the store and asked,  "Is there any reason you're being an asshole to me today?"    Alright, sister, the buck stops here.   I was an asshole?  I was doing what any respectable retail salesperson does by taking care of the customers.  She didn't seem to grasp that point, although I did my best to drive it through her thick head.  I really didn't want to get so vocal with Five-O, but I had to.  First, she called me an asshole for no good reason.  Second, she kept interrupting me while I was going off on her, which made me go off even more.  It's not that getting loud made me feel good, but it was time some one put their foot down.  I can't really say how loud you have to get to make a stupid person hear you, but I can say I got that loud yesterday.

      The search for a new company to call "paycheck" is picking up steam, although I have not been hired yet.  I just returned home from the Columbia, Missouri area, where I spent the last three days interviewing and filling more applications.  It's strange how I can't get so much as an interview here, but travel four hours and *bam* interviews galore.  Still no takers.  I'm suffering a complex from this rejection; a sense of thinking I am somehow not wanted as an employee.  Jobs were so easy to come by a few years ago, and now?  I would like to think my knowledge and skill bases have grown.  Doesn't that make me more...employable?  Apparently not.  Current musical flavor:  country

      ...and the livin's easy.  Well, not that easy.  Yesterday was Independence Day.  My father's neighborhood has a block party every year, so I attended that.  What fun!  We shot off over $400 worth of loud, bright fireworks.  I think there's something evil about people enjoying explosives, but at least we get to blow things up legally once a year.  I visited the other half last week.  It was so good to see her :)  I met her mother and reintroduced myself to others.  I also met our year-old pony, "Echo."  It's my opinion that, if you name anything Echo, you should just name it Echo Echo.  Oh well, he just stands there eating and whatnot.  It's great.  While I was there, I also filled out applications and dropped resumes at various businesses in the area.  It wasn't my first choice to move, although the pros seem to outweigh the cons.  Besides, it's not just about me any more.  And, so, I will be travelling again this week.  I already have an interview scheduled, which is more consideration than I've gotten from any company in this area.  I think I'll be moved in less than a month.  Summertime...and the livin's easy :)  Current musical flavor:  Sublime
