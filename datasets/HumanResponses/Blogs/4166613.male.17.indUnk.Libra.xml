      I didn't write that letter to my mom after all. I don't know why, I knew while arielle was here that I had to, it was on my mind the whole time, but I just never said anything, I was to affraid. I really really don't know what to do anymore, sometimes I feel so stupid for even letting anyone know anything about this, I can hide it well enough that no one would ever have to know. I guess I'm just stuck between living with it and fixing it, both are verry long roads, and I know which one is the best, believe me I know, it's just that road is so dark, and the dark scares the shit out of me.

      yesterday I worked with arielle, steaming clothes and that such, I was kinda like falling over the whole time though, sorry arielle, I was just verry dizzy with no explenation of why. I got an aplication for chilis (whoo whoo), I aactually really hope they hire me there, it's close to home and most importantly a resturant, which is where I want to be working for the next like god knows how long, all through university and the such.  I get to go to victoria, thats pretty damn cool, I've never been, well I've been to vancouver but never victoria, I hope it'll be as good as it sounds. then when we get back, school starts again, booooooo, booooo, booooo at you school, boooooo. I'm curious as to our new drama teacher, I think I might be her first TA of the year, which may or may not be a good thing. one thing I know is if she doesn't organize improv, well then it'll be the thor and marcus show, every day, every lunch, no tech people, who needs em, no practices, we'll suck but who cares.  band practice friday, hopefully will be another good one, I'd like to sometime in the not so far future, you know, actually play a show, we'll see though, so far we've only got like two or three full songs with lyrics, so it might be a while, we'll I guess I'll just wait and look forward to when we're ready.

      so it kinda sucks that I had to change my blog just because the only people I never wanted to them somehow got a hold of the adress and then started using my posts to bring up subjects of talk which no one wanted.  but hey, thats how things go I guess though if I gave you this adress, I would prefer if you didn't tell anyone it, just give them my old one, because if I told you it, it means your one of the people I actually would want, or wouldn't mind reading this stuff  anyways on to current events so I think I might finally go to see a doctor, thanks to arielle, who tommorow will help me write a letter to my mom, because she knows nothing about my problems, and actually it's really really frightening thinking of what she'll think of me, I just don't want to do it, I don't want my family to know, even if it's just my mom, I just got so good at hiding it, it just seems like a way of life, and they actually respect me living this way of life, if I change that, they're gonna notice, and my mom will know, and I know her, she'll tell everyone and just say "don't tell him I told you, he made me promise", close to everyone in my family is one of those people that just can't keep a secret, my mom one of the most, I know she'll tell them, no matter how much I ask and beg her not to. but I think I have to do it, I have to tell her, because I can't afford a psychiatrist on my own, but I think I really need to see one, just so maybe I can fix it, maybe they have something they can do, I'm sure they do. but what I'm really most affraid of, is actually hearing someone tell me what it is I have, those words coming out of their mouth will be the longest most devastating I've ever heard I'm sure of it, I just don't want to know, but I need to.  another thing is that being stupid and crazy seems to have fit in as part of my personality, and the reasons that sometimes I look and seem like a total idiot, and that I just seem to have no clue of whats going on around me, is because of the problem I have, and how I try to hide it, people laugh and think I'm funny. that sounds really stupid but it'll be gone, won't you miss it? hahaha I might a bit because I can laugh later that day about all the stupid things I did, like how not being able to make orange.  thank you so much arielle, just for even caring
