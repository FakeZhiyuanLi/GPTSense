      so i got off the phone with my friend and we were discussing whether it is possible whether there exists a guy who doesn't really care for the bar and if he does go does not get sloshed completely and do stupid and inane things they later regret?  So we asked the question... Do guys who don't get rip roaring drunk and hit on girls really exist?    i've gathered info from 4 of my friends and they've all told me that their man has actually gone to bars, told them they love their girlfriends then go and get drunk with the boys and end up making out or fucking other chicks.  then their excuse is that they were really drunk.  i mean we ladies get drunk and crazy at the bars but we don't do that sort of stuff.  i mean i've had PLENTY of opportunities but in the end i'd rather hang with my friends instead of getting frisky with some stranger.  I mean it's happened to me, my boyfriend going to the bar and disrespecting me by making out with some chick.  It totally destroyed me but u know, it was bound to happen sooner or later.  I guess with some guys, not all, even if they get the slightest bit of attention from a girl(don't matter how hot, she could be BUTT uggly) it wouldn't matter, they would go for the bait and forget what they have at home to feel that one moment of being desirable by another lady other than their own.  to show THEIR friends that "hey, even if i have a lady at home, i can still hook up with other chicks! i'm a playa!"  so that's what they think.. they're not players, they're cowards.  it's sad to think this has happened to a lot of my friends who i've grown up with and now we all have distorted visions of marriage and commitment.  when i was younger i always though i'd get married, meet the man of my dreams and everything would be peachy keen.  that was me when i was 12.  Now at 25, i don't even think i'll ever come close to that and that is a reality.  My first REAL REAL boyfriend was darren.  he treated me SOOOO well,.  he never cheated on me, never commented on my weight or looks, he was just happy to be with me. supported me at everything i did and we hardly fought.  i think we had 2 fights(he said we only fought twice) in our  year courtship : ).    seems like as soon as i moved from winnipeg to Toronto, i've been meeting a lot of guys who just cheat on me time after time.  after a while, u become numb and your vision of marriage and happily ever after soon fades.  maybe i've become bitter and resentful at what has happened.  but i guess it's better if i learn this now instead of later when i'm married and have a family and my husband cheats on me.  If guys who cheat truly believe the grass is greener on the other side,  why do u tell us u love us and then go fool round with a stranger?  why not just leave us and then go do your thing.  it doesn't matter to us, we'd rather know that you will cheat and then just dump us and go do it, not while we're still together.  stop being selfish and be a MAN about it.  a real MAN wouldn't cheat and hurt the girl he loves right?  maybe they never really loved us and just wanted us cause of our kind heart.  why can't guys give up heavy drinking at the bars? i mean what's the point? it's not "cool" anymore to get drunk and do stupid things.. maybe when u're in high school?  not now. i mean sure u can go to the bar and have a few drinks but not to the point where u have no idea what u're doing.  it's just sad what my friends and i have gone through.  i'm seeing them this week so i'm pretty happy.  it's good to know that even though we're not in the same city, we still have a connection.  it's really nice actually.  so the answer to the this nite's blog is "yea i believe there is a guy out there still that doens't do that sort of thing or feel the need to get trashed at the bar every chance he gets"  i really believe  he does exist.  i mean i have to, if i didn't i would just give up and become a nun right?

      I just want to know why people in your life that you care about deeply and that you share everything with still feels the need to keep secrets.  Maybe i'm too honest with guys i date.  Maybe it's a Toronto thing, where guys here feel that they have to keep secrets and lie about it.  I had a relationship once that was built on trust and NO lies( well except the occasional... "ugh.. noo i didn't eat your last chocolate..."  )   Does trust and No lies in relationships exist when we're older?  I've been dating for a while, i'm 25 and still seems like every guy I date has to lie about something!  I've talked to a few of my friends and they too have expeienced lies and secrets with their men.   What's the point of a relationship if u feel that u have to lie and keep secrets from the person u "supposedly" LOVE and CHERISH.  Why not just be honest and say "Listen, all i want is the pysical part of the relationship, not the connectivity.. "  I mean if all men we upfront with that instead of making us women believe that there is something more than pyhsical, then the world would be a better place for us!  My friend Debbie quoted it well " We came into this world alone, we can live in this world alone"

      S0 it's monday and it's weird how when u don't have a job u just think every day is a weekend?  Sigh... but the job hunt is getting annoying!  Interviews and research about the companies.. wearing the suits, smiling and telling them that "yes i am not lazy even though i am"? hahahahahahahaaaaaa  I had an AWESOME weeekend!  went canooing in the loo!  but the "person" I was with (u know who u are) kept yelling at me to paddle and paddle!  sheesssssh! all i wanted to do was just chill out and RELAX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Guess i'll use this as my online diary.. doubt anyone will read it but it'll be funny to see what i used to write back in the days.....  I guess this is my form of "therapy", to air out my issues and thoughts.  Even though i talk a lot, i don't really tell people what I really think... Blogging should be fun!  : )
