      Ok, so I worked out I want to lose weight. I suppose this got me thinking about my life more too. It feels like I haven't done anything yet. I want to come away from a situation, feeling proud, thinking "I did that".....  I feel I have failed in so many areas.... work, money, relationships... Particularly relationships I suppose. Too many wrong relationships while I work out what's right. And now I have worked out what is right, it's hard to find. It's never equal. I like someone, and they don't, or don't like me as much. A man likes me, but I don't like him in the same way. I want that partnership, where there are no hurtful words making me feel bad about myself. I want to listen, but to be listened to. It would just be great to know that there was someone out there that liked me, just for me, and that they would support me in whatever I wanted to do.  A lot to ask, but I think everyone deserves it. What is the point in staying in a relationship that makes you feel bad about yourself? I suppose this has applied to my friendships too. Having an equal friendship would be the best thing in the world right now.  But, things are going to improve. I don't think I have lost weight this week, but I am certainly eating healthier. I haven't had the usual glass or two of wine, and have rediscovered proper sleep. It can only get better from here. I reached bottom, and now I am climbing back up. I know it's not going to be easy, and I know I will slip occasionally, but this time it is going to be different. This is for life - I am claiming my life back.

      Ok... so my life is changing. I have been made redundant from my job and don't know where the money to pay the bills is coming from next month. I am living with my parents again, and I have never felt so alone in my life.  But above all this, I'm fat. There it is, the truth. I am fed up of being fat. There are no excuses. I eat the wrong things, drink too much wine, and don't exercise enough. It's not my genes, or thyroid problems - its me. And I don't like this me right now.  So, things are going to change. I have done diets before, but always given up for no good reason. And the daft thing is that I have lost weight. I am 5ft 6, and weigh 14 stone. I know that's not healthy. I don't want to only be able to shop in a couple of places. I want to be thin and gain my self confidence back. So, that's my plan.  In 18 months time, I get my proper job back. The job I always wanted to do. I love my job in the theatre, and to do it well, I need to lose weight. I want to go back there looking fantastic, and feeling on top of the world. I will have my self confidence and pride in myself again. I will not be single any longer. This is my mission.  So, it all starts on Monday. Back to the diet club where I lost loads of weight before. No excuses this time. I want to do this. I need to do this. I need to break the cycle of losing weight, then gaining it all through comfort eating when something bad happens in life. This is for me, for the rest of my life. And having been fat, I will appreciate being thin so much more than when I was.  Life is going to change....
