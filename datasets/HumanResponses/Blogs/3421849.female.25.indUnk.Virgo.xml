      And why in the world does she think she's important enough to rant, rave, and ramble in this public forum? Perhaps I can shed a little light on me-me-me-me-me and answer those questions along the way. You may read a bit about me in my profile and that's stellar if you do; however, a profile is but an outlined image of a person. So here's some of the rest of the story.   I'm Meghan. I'm 25.   I'm the dashing (hah!) daughter of two cool, cool parental units named Ron and Sharon and the saucy (yes!) sister of a studly brother named Corey. These three crazy ones and I make my family unit. Mom, Dad, and Cor all reside in the land of lakes, Minnesota. That's where I'm from, mostly.  I have a dog. She came from the pound named June Bug, but she was too tough for such a cute-sey name. So now she's just June. Yeah, that's a lot tougher sounding now. I'm pretty sure she's a full-blooded Border Collie with an obsession for any object that can be used in a game of fetch. She would live and die for the game of fetch. Was she a retriever in a previous life?  June and I live in one of the nation's best kept secrets, a national park hidden in the southwest of west Texas. It is, indeed, possible to hide something in Texas. We're talking about a state that takes more than twelve hours to cross by vehicle. Anyhow, I (we, if you'll indulge me in speaking of June and I) live in Big Bend National Park.  I'm a National Park Service employee. The answer to your next question is that, yes, at some point in my still short career with the National Park Service, I have worn the "Smokey Bear" ranger hat. Proudly, may I add. One of the perks of being an NPS employee is that you get to live IN a national park. Nobody else can do that. I feel pretty lucky.  I love the outdoors. Any time I can be outside, I am a much happier camper. If you take away 8 hours for work and 8 hours for sleep, I will venture a guess that the majority of the other 8 hours in a day I am outside. Perhaps this will lead to crow's feet about my eyes at a young age, but, indeed, it'll keep my mind and the rest of my body young forever. Hiking, running, and biking are probably the best of the best when it comes to my favorite outdoor activities. I am a woman of motion, it's a bit hard to get me to stop. Hence the attraction to activities requiring lots of physical activity.  Don't get me wrong, there are definite times and places to slow down, to take in the scenery, to curl in with a good book, to feel one's resting heart rate bump along. For me, these times and places must come when I feel tired from a long run, when my face feels blown by the wind from a day on the trail, when I feel satiated by movement.  I love to travel. In country, out-of-country, the whole nine yards. I credit my parents and grandparents for introducing the art of traveling to me as a youngun'. Cross-country road trips were a highlight of summertime in my family. Whether it was a long trip with Grandma and Grandpa and four of us cousins or my family unit on a western national park road trip extravaganza, traveling seemed innate to me. Over the years, however, the scale has gotten a bit bigger as I discovered the rest of the world. I think I can list the countries I have (so far) been to: Canada, United States, Mexico, Guatemala, England, France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Tanzania (including Zanzibar), and Kenya. At 25, I feel I am doing pretty good. Without travel and all of its associated joys and experiences, it is quite possible that I might melt into a little puddle. I fear that there are so many places in the world to experience that I'll never have time to make a dent. Little by little, ndiyo mwendo. That's Kiswahili; I speak it decently, though I'm sure I'll elaborate later.  I love good food. I love to cook it. I love to eat it. I love to shop for it. I love to eat good food in the company of good people. A friend once told me, "Food, it's just a vehicle for ketchup," but I had to disagree. Rather, I say food is a vehicle for good times and good conversation. Sit me down in a good Thai restaurant, let me fix you up a heaping plate of spaghetti with my homemade sauce, tell me about how you made that dazzling cheesecake, talk with me all the while, and I'll be your friend forever. It may also be proper to mention here that I'm a no-meatie. Yeah, no meat for me. It all started when I watched a pig be slaughtered at the tender age of fifteen in Guatemala, the day I realized that meat comes from living creatures. It took a few years to get on the right path and to figure out the no-meat plan, but I haven't had meat in many years now.  My personality. I'm extroverted, my energy comes from the people and the world around me. Solitary confinement was invented as torture for people like me, I'd die. I'm a goal-oriented kind of girl. I set my mind to something, big goal, little goal, and there's no stopping me. That's also where stubbornness comes along, but I won't elaborate. I'm shy around new people, but once I know you, I cut loose and show my colors. I'm of the responsible kind. You know, you call me and I'll call you back, I promise. Some people would call me funny, others would say, "Well, she's certainly got that dry sarcasm thing going!" Love it or leave it, that's me, but I do attempt to use humor elaborately. Humor creates comfort, relieves tension, makes people feel safe with each other; this must be scientific fact somewhere. I'm an idea-maker, creative. I can conjure idea after idea, but it's the development of the idea and the implementation of such that I lag on. Need some creative spirit? I can help. I am strong of mind. This comes in handy and works well with my constant need to be in motion. Endurance and a strong will are critical factors in the highly physical endeavors I engage in. Along this line, I am also strong-willed when it comes to my morals and beliefs. I'm a sticking to my guns kind of chica.   So, perhaps that's me, a little bit of me anyways. More like what they called an "expanded outline" of my college days. I guess this blog will become the actual content of the "paper" of my life. Welcome to my world.

      Is this thing going to work? If it does, who will read it? Will anyone care about one little person's meager existence on earth? I hope so, but here goes anyway. Hey, y'all. If you're here and you're reading this it's because: 1) you already know me and you want to know more, 2) you already know me and I'm forcing you to read this, or 3) you don't know me but you'd like to learn more about me. Whatever the case, welcome aboard.   I found Blogger.com quite randomly whilst surfing the realm of cyberspace and decided I liked the idea of posting my life for the whole world to see. No really, since I have  family and friends world wide round, I thought that my own little piece of Blogger.com would be the perfect way to keep all of you in the know.  Please enjoy...

      Today, as late afternoon arrived, the temperature at my moderate elevation of 3800 feet above sea level was hovering close to 100 degrees F. And humid, the air racked with moisture for its second day in a row, altogether suffocating for desert dwellers. 'Round about 5 pm, I saw it coming from the north, a cloudy wall of gray and brown dust, the leading edge of a good old traditional west Texas dust storm. I waited and watched it approach impatiently, knowing that by tolerating a few minutes, maybe an hour, of dust and high winds, the Big Bend would be rewarded with more manageable temperatures and humidities behind the windy front.   As the dust front approached my window, I sealed it shut to close out the dust that would permeate every crevice of the indoors if allowed. With a fierce rush it arrived and the creosote out front began whipping to and fro' almost animately. I watched the dust turn circles in the building's open courtyard, miniature tornadoes of energy trapped in this enclosed spot. The sun's light dimmed slightly for a time, faded out by the dust in the air. As this occurred, I watched the thermometer plummet, 14 degrees in less than an hour. Now, later in the evening, it's a refreshing 77 degrees F out-of-doors. I can't wait to close up shop and enjoy it.  During the wrath of the dust storm and the turbid winds that fluttered through the courtyard, a house finch nest in the building's rafters was upended. Two tiny babies, eyes closed, featherless, and skin dimpled like a chicken's, took a mortal fall to the courtyard ground. After the storm, I noticed a small commotion in the courtyard, finches chattering and calling, sounding almost alarmed. I followed the noise to see the matter and found the two little ones lying side by side. I was momentarily at a loss for what to do. The finch community was in apparent mourning, should I leave the babies for them? Would I placate their alarm by removing the babies from sight? What to do? In the end, I waited for the commotion to die down, then I took the babies out to the desert earth and left them, hoping something would be able to profit from their loss.  There is a natural order to things, this I am sure of. The desert tonight is bathed in cool dry air, but a finch community lost a couple of young ones right outside my door. Simple elements to a complex system I cannot begin to fathom. So I think I'll stick with the little details.

      In the land of the desert heat, I try hard to get up and get out for my daily run before the heat of the day is upon me. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you feel about it, myself and the rest of the population of Big Bend all have the same idea. By "the population of Big Bend" I mean that which is animal, but non-human. In other words, the animal kingdom seems to be out in full force in the early morning.   My goal was 6 miles this morning, 3 miles out in a single direction, and then back again. Pretty simple, right? About 1 1/2 miles from my house on the return trip, I noticed a large, moving, black object on the road about 150 yards in front of me. Mind you, the road splays out in a long straightaway at this point, and visibility is at least 1/2 mile. Don't ask me where my mind was but I can assure you it was somewhere amongst its typical running ramblings, and not in the present moment and the road in front of me. A bear! A bear? A large black bear loping in my direction.  The encounter was brief, the glimpse fleeting, the moments over before I wanted them to be. In the low sun of the early morning, I could see the tips of the bear's back hair glowing with light. I watched the bear lope in apparent gangliness, long arms and legs splaying about, though at the same time noting just how powerful the creature appeared.  The bear never gave June and I a passing glance, and I have to say I felt a little snubbed. June, however, was quite intrigued. She whined and danced like she wanted to play with the bear and I could only assume she had never seen one before. As quickly as the bear appeared in my vision, it climbed down off the road and disappeared into the brush.  Just a regular day in paradise...

       The following is but a small part of a long series of writings I have done about the Big Bend area during my time here. The land, its people, its history are fascinating and awe-inspiring for me. It is most difficult to articulate the details of this land that allow people (including me) to fall in love with it. However, I make attempts, as skewed as they may be. So, an introduction to the Big Bend...   I peer through a single-paned glass window in my home, one of the few tangible representations of humanity present here, at a vastness of space unfolding before me into deep wilderness, the Chihuahuan Desert. This acreage rolls wildly from mountain to river, from pinon pine to tornillo mesquite, from peregrine falcon to scaled quail. 801,000 acres of the Chihuahuan Desert in far west Texas perch protected by the United States Federal Government as Big Bend National Park. This is my home and has been for several years now.   I do believe it takes a fierce determination to make one's way to this corner of the world, whether one comes to visit or to stay a while. To arrive in the Big Bend, one must shut eyes and noses to the George W. Bush, sulfur-reeking, land-scraping oil fields of west Texas. One must also navigate among the drone of conservative cattle ranch politicking, large predator eradication soap-boxing, and economics-before-environment opinionating in order to find this promised land. In one's journey here, the soul can't help but wonder if there is any possibility that a national park could be hidden in all this disarray.   Indeed, she does, and she doesn't just hide, she unfolds her layers in tremendous splendor, nestling herself between the rest of west Texas and the Mexican border. The national park is bordered on three sides by gigantose super power cattle ranches and on a fourth by the pitifully poco Rio Grande, an international border which now only trickles through a large bend in the floodplain, giving the region its namesake. But within these borders, Big Bend National Park and all of her diversity play out a show only Mother Nature herself could induce.  The Big Bend is a land of innate solitude, a land where the howl of the coyote and the wail of the red tail hawk can reign across creation without another soul to hear it. Some might call this solitude desolation; the Big Bend's physicality is, indeed, a challenging one and one that affords the land with a big hint of a bigger untouchable nature. Hardy souls who possess adaptability, ingenuity, tolerance, and toughness are the ones who survive and thrive here. Most of the Big Bend's inhabitants, human and other, would probably argue, however, that such conditions are not harsh or impossible, but just difficult enough to keep out all but the hardiest in nature.       But if you are one of the few souls who are so touched by the land that you return for visit after visit, or you decide to stay here altogether, the Big Bend makes a marvelous destination. From within my home here, I can watch the sun drench the Chisos Mountains in a bath of fire as it rises above the horizon each morning. I can see the lowland desert roll gently in a tide of subtle earth tones, harboring a diversity of life that one could never imagine of such an empty space. I can watch the omnipresent desert sentinel, the raven, circle high above me on the thermals, watching over this land as ravens have for generations. I can see the play of afternoon cumulus, water vapor and electricity stacking high into the summer skies, until finally spilling onto the earth with unfathomable power and energy. I am, as many visitors to this land are, touched and enlightened by it with regularity.

      Pre-race: Myself and four other Big Benders are planning to run the Motorola Marathon in Austin, TX this year. Two of them live in the park and so we have done some runs together here and there. The two others live about a half hour away, so I've not run with either of them and I'm quite sure I wouldn't recognize them on race day even if I wanted to. Amy D. and Melissa F. are my park running friends. We decided to do this race somewhere around September or October, so I guess you can say I've been training since then. I consider myself well-prepared. Wishing all of us lots of luck.  Friday, 2/13/04: We wake up to cold, wet, icy weather in Big Bend. This kind of weather only hits this area once or twice a winter season, and it has to pick today, the day we are to drive to Austin, TX! We hear that portions of roads are closed due to ice and so Amy D., her companion, and I take a round-about route through west Texas, arriving in the evening in Austin. Melissa F. and her husband drove out a day or two prior. I meet up with my parents at a hotel, who've driven all the way from their home in Minnesota to be my cheerleaders. They've also driven with another special mission to deliver my new vehicle, a 2002 Toyota 4Runner that I recently purchased from a Toyota dealership in Minnesota. I tell you, these guys are angels! I'm thrilled to be in Austin for the marathon, thrilled for their company, and thrilled about my new wheels. We all unpack at the hotel and dine out on some Mexican food. In the car we hear that the weather is forecasting snow for tonight. Good thing the race isn't until Sunday!    Saturday, 2/14/04: I have no Valentine today, but I don't mind much because I have lots of other exciting things on my mind. I wake up and look out the window to find a dusting of snow on the ground! Snow in Austin, TX! I immediately lace my shoes for an easy 3 miles out in the snow. I haven't got much of an area to run, this hotel is surrounded completely by a freeway and 2 major highways. So I do several laps around the industrial complex's parking lots, racking up 27 minutes of leg-stretching, padding through melting whiteness, and dodging a snowball or 2 from Texas kids who honestly look as if they've never seen snow. We spend today doing errands and shopping around, in the afternoon moving to one of the starting line hotels in north Austin. Literally about 400 yards from the start. We decide to drive back into Austin via the race route, just to get a feel for where this race goes. The course, or the first 15 miles that we see, is beautiful, so much downhill! Love that! In the evening, we meet up with Amy and her cheerleading squad, as well as Melissa and her squad for a good old fashioned Italian restaurant carbo load of the finest kind. The waitress made a mistake on Melissa's order and so she blessed the whole table with free dessert. I couldn't resist indulging. After excited and nervous chatter and bantering over the next day's extravaganza, we all head back north to our starting line hotels, taking a moment to mill over the starting area. The 3 of us runners pick a certain tree next to a certain set of porta-potties and agree to meet there in the morning. And off we go to bed. I was tired and not feeling too nervous, so I drift off quickly.  Sunday, 2/15/04, 5:30 am: The alarm goes off and to my surprise, I'm not awake before my alarm. I feel so relaxed about this race. I pull on some sweats and head down to the hotel lobby to see just how cold it really is. Down there, lots of runners are doing the same thing. It's cold, I can see my breath, probably below freezing. But the sky is clear and I know it'll warm up as soon as the sun rises. So I decide on shorts, a long-sleeved polypro shirt, and a wind-breaking vest. Back up in the hotel room, my parents are waking up and I can tell my mother is nervous. I decide, though I love her dearly, to avoid her for the time being to keep her nerves from rubbing off on me. I get dressed, drink some water, eat a banana and a breakfast bar, and now it's about time to walk to the starting line. I wear an old sweatshirt, too, one I'm not afraid of losing if I can't find my parents to toss it to them as I pass by the hotel. I say good-bye to my parents at the hotel and I can't help but chuckle about the look of worry on my mother's face. I know, I know, it's a mother's job, but I can do this! Walking to the starting line I can see already thousands of people milling about. I find the designated meeting spot and neither Amy or Melissa are there, so I get in line for a nearby porta-pottie where I can keep our meeting point in sight. As I wait in the line, I stretch my legs and arms, fiddling around to keep from getting too cold.   Sunday, 2/15/04, 6:55 am: At the starting line, I place myself right with the 4 hour pace group, perhaps a third of the way back in the pack. I waited for Melissa and Amy as long as I could, and when they didn't show, I proceeded to the starting line alone. The energy of the crowd is high, and it's wearing off on me, I can feel the race adrenaline starting its course through my body. What a nice feeling, especially as it overrides the feeling of cold.   Sunday, 2/15/04, Starting Line: At 7 am the gun goes off and everyone cheers. My place in the crowd doesn't move for a full minute or so, and when it does, it only crawls. I cross the starting line about 3 or so minutes after the gun. I've lined up at the edge of the street, so I'll run right by my hotel driveway. Hopefully my parents will be there and I can toss them my sweatshirt. They are and they see me coming, camera ready. I'm surprised to see Melissa with my parents. She was evidently in front of me at the starting line, saw my parents who said they hadn't seen me yet, and so she waited with them for a minute or so. How fortunate!  Mile 1: We're just crawling along among, so many people, trying to weave our way among the folks who got too far up front for their paces. We're running eastward and the sun is rising in our faces. It feels great.  Mile 2-4: The miles just fly by. I hadn't seen Melissa in a week or so, so we spent some time catching up, chattering, and just plain gawking at the scene. We're amazed when we look over to see a man next to us talking on his cell phone! Ah, the modern age. We're also amused by the helicopter we can see in the distance following the best of the best at the front; they already look so far away! We've decided to stop for Powerade and water every three miles for the first part of the race. Trotting through the aid stations, I down the liquids while on the move. Though the sun is up, it's still cold; I look down at my thighs and they're red from the cold air. Hope it warms up!  Mile 5: Around here is a major road intersection and here are my parents! They don't see us coming and my mother is surprised when I toss my gloves in her direction. They are all smiles and so are we.  Mile 9: Another major intersection where I see my parents and Melissa sees some friends. It's great not only to have all the crowds cheering us, but to see familiar faces about. We're keeping a nice pace at this point, some where around 8:30 minute miles. I don't know how long it will last, but I'll enjoy the feeling of floating on the breeze while I can.  Half-Marathon-Mile 15: Melissa and I agree to split up at the half-marathon point. She's nervous about the pace and, though I see no signs of fatigue in her yet, she wants to conserve energy. I wish I could conserve, but it's not so much in my nature. At this point on the course, there's a lot of energy and the running is easy. Noise, music, cheering, the whole entourage of the half-marathon finish line. A short time later, we're running past the capitol building and right down Congress Avenue. It's a picture-perfect scene and there are my parents again, there to capture me on film. How great they are! My mother hands me a few slices of orange and they taste good. Somewhere along here, my stomach growls and so I eat a breakfast bar. It has become a beautiful day in Austin, the sun climbing higher and warming the air. I'm tempted to leave my vest with my parents, but in the end decide against it. I never did heat up enough to really want to take it off. My small frame just isn't holding in all the heat it's producing!   Mile 15-17: This is a long, broad uphill to a turn-around point. As I head out to the turn around point, I'm watching people heading back in, who are 10-20 minutes ahead of me on the course. I keep thinking I'll see Amy along this point, as I know she must be some distance in front of me, but I don't. She must really be flying along! On the way back, I see and high five Melissa, she's now just a few minutes behind me, and looking absolutely stellar. I should just wait for her, but I keep on keepin' on.   Mile 18: A nice short downhill puts us along the banks of Town Lake and I'm feeling the first signs of fatigue. There's a really cool band playing underneath a large overpass. The echo is phenomenal and I can hear the band a long way off. This scene diverts my attention from my fatigue for a bit.  Mile 19-21: This is my most unfavorite part of the course. Somewhere along here I see my parents again, the last time before the finish line. They ask my how I'm doing and I concede that I'm getting tired. They tell me that I still look good and their pictures from that point, that I see later, attest to their point. Surprisingly, I did still look good! I get a few more slices of orange from my mother and eat a half of a breakfast bar. Looking for some quick energy. Along here, I've slowed my pace a good deal and now I'm stopping at each of the aid stations, walking and hydrating. There's a mile or two here that seem to wind endlessly up and down some neighborhood streets. This dog-legging is driving me crazy and I think to myself that if they needed to dog-leg for exact distances, they shouldn't do it at this point in the race when runners are tired. It's obvious now that I'm feeling a little grumpy. I'm moved and motivated by two young women who are obviously running partners. They're speaking about getting each other through this tough time, about what they've made it through before. It's nice to hear them, and I hope some of their positive energy wears off on me!   Mile 21-25: At mile 21 or so, the route climbs up onto Town Lake's dam. We cross over it and head back along the other side of Town Lake. I know from this point on it's a straight shot to the finish. I've gotten past my low tired moments now; I don't feel pain anymore, but I know I can no longer maintain the same pace. I resolve to a approximate 10:00 mile pace and that's okay by me. There's a man in a funny costume somewhere along here. I don't know what he's supposed to be, but the fact that he's wearing his underwear over his clothes is immediately entertaining. There is a real mix of energy along this point. Some people in their lowest lows, fighting fatigue and barely keeping any pace. And others who still appear happily spirited and light on their feet. I empathize with those who are hurting, but hope that the energy of those who are feeling good wears off on me.  Mile 25: The end it so close, I can feel it. Along this point, the course begins to narrow and is lined with spectators several people deep on each side. There's a tremendous energy radiating from the crowd. I'm amazed that the city of Austin cheers so hard for random strangers they don't know running through their town. Around this point, in my entertainment over the scene and lack of attention to the ground, I step into a pothole who's cover is not in flat. I roll my left ankle outward, feeling nothing in my ankle, and a pull in the outside of my left knee. There is no pain, except that when I try to hop step to prevent the full roll, my calf muscles almost seize in cramps. I keep running, saving them from that pain.  Finish Line: The finishing chute is long and lined with bleachers, lots and lots of people cheering. My parents are along the chute and see me come through, though I don't see them as I pass by. I'm elated to cross the finish line and the time says 4:02 and some seconds as I pass under. After getting a medal, water, and turning in my computer chip, I proceed out from the finish line and stand there waiting. The crowd is thick with runners and their loved ones, so I stay still and let the masses move around me. I figure my parents will find me, and within a few minutes, I can see their heads peaking between other heads and I make my way towards them. Lots of hugs and congratulations when we meet, I'm sweaty and salty and they still want to hug me! They ask me if I'm tired and, though I know I am physically tired, I don't feel it at the moment. I'm riding the energy of the finish line celebration. We decide to hang about and wait for Melissa and so we do for 30 minutes or so, never seeing her. Lost in the crowds among all these people. By now I'm feeling famished and so I claim a few bagels and Powerade bottles and we begin the walk back to the car. It is in these moments that I feel the first bits of stiffness in my left knee, the one that pulled in the pothole at Mile 25. It doesn't feel bad so I don't think much of it.  Back at the hotel: I immediately shower and climb into some warm, comfy, dry clothes. I open a package of Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies and just start eating. Among the other things I ate that afternoon, I managed to put away the whole package of Thin Mints. My treat to myself that I had been thinking about all day! I spend some time stretching and laying horizontal until it's time to move to another hotel. My parents continue to be absolute dolls by congratulating me with a night in a fancy hotel with a hot tub and pool, as well as a one hour massage.   Sunday, 2/15/04, evening: I'm amazed at the wonders the massage and hot tub treatments have worked. I really don't feel like I've run a marathon today. I owe my parents big time. That evening, we dined out for Thai food in downtown Austin, a real treat, my favorite kind of food! After sitting a while at the table, I got up and felt immediate pain in my left knee. Not a good sign, but I didn't think too much of it, just an ache associated with running a long race. After dinner and before I crashed into a long sleep, I finally called Amy and Melissa and got them on the telephone. They both were okay, ran good races, and were in high spirits. We talked only for a bit, but promised to catch up once we got back to Big Bend. I tell my parents when I go to bed that I am planning to sleep until I wake up, no alarms please, and I think I sleep for 11 hours. Maybe I really did run a marathon today!  Monday, 2/16/04: I've got this whole week off work, a little congratulatory vacation. My parents and I spend today being Austin tourists, enjoying the sights of downtown Austin. A beautiful city. Admittedly my knee hurts, but not horribly, so I go on stretching and icing it. Otherwise, I'm hardly sore at all and I attribute that to the massage and hot tub treatments yesterday. I reckon that will be my recovery plan for any long race. That and thin mint cookies.  Tuesday, 2/17/04: I awake to no soreness or stiffness, not even in my knee and decide to go down to the hotel's fitness room and give the treadmill a go. Two days after the race, you ask? Yes, I swear I'm going to become a spokesperson for "How to Recover Quickly from Marathons" if I don't watch out. Unfortunately, my knee hurts to run, so I run a little but mostly walk. It feels good to move my body though.  Wednesday, 2/18-Sunday, 2/22: Spending time in Austin and Galveston, I feel completely recovered, other than my knee. After a week of decent rest on my knee, which has in the past been a good cure for most of my leg ails, I still feel pain and I know I've done something a little more serious to it. I decide when I return home to Big Bend, I'll call for a doctor's appointment.  An Afterward: My finish time card came in the mail, saying my official chip time was 3:59:12. I'm pretty pleased with myself, as my goal had been "anything under 4 hours." I made it by the skin of my teeth, but that's okay by me. Amy did quite well, she came in a few minutes under the qualifying time for the Boston Marathon in her age group, so I reckon she'll be Boston-bound in the spring of 2005. Melissa also did well, finishing 7th for her age group (she'll kill me if I say which age group is hers!), but she missed her Boston qualifying time by mere seconds. I'm disappointed for her, but when I talk with her, she isn't. She's happy to have run her first marathon and she wants to do it again next year! As for me, I visit a sports medicine doctor, who proclaims after an x-ray and MRI that I have a partial tear in the collateral ligament on the outside of my left knee, that it'll take a few months to heal, that I should be lucky I didn't tear it all the way and require surgery. I feel lucky, take a heavy dose of anti-inflammatory drugs, and trot around the neighborhood pretty darn slow, if at all, for a while. By May I am mostly healed and manage a 45 minute 10k at the Relay For Life, still riding the remaining coat tails of marathon training physical fitness. In the beginning of June, I feel like a whole new person, and am back to a consistent 30 miles per week. Hopefully by July I'll return to 40 miles per week or so, back to the normal routine entirely. After this third marathon of mine, I still feel like I am hooked. I spend lots of time thinking about next time, so I know there will be lots more running down the road.

       I proclaim neither order to my thoughts nor the proceedings of this online blog; therefore, you will notice that my writing skips from topic to topic. Such is the movement of life, hopping and skipping along from one moment to another, however, and I will write in the manner that life progresses. Onward...   1) I feel like the most fortunate person in the world. It really is the simple things that seem unendingly satisfying. It is my Friday, time to relax for a few days away from work. Coworkers and friends have asked me to housesit/dogsit. This is thrilling for several reasons. First of all, their dog and my dog love to play together. While June the Border Collie receives inordinate amounts of attention from the human population, she is a bit unsocialized to dogs. This weekend will provide her with a great opportunity to play with another dog that also loves to play, is a similar size, a similar breed, and who lets June be top dog. This is a recipe for pure dog success. Secondly, this house has a small pool that I'm sure to lounge in. Now I know this sounds lame to my non-desert dwelling readers, but bodies of water to soak and swim in are at an absolute premium here and I am blessed to have one of my own for several days. Hello tiki drinks and laying out in the sun! Finally, this home has a TV. Whoa, real exciting, right? Yes! I do not have a TV, so when I am given the opportunity to watch TV or movies or anything that comes out of that box, I soak up every moment of it. I am generally glad that I don't have a TV in life, but it sure makes the rare moments when I am around one all the more pleasing.  2) Friday evening some friends and I ventured to Alpine, TX's best (and almost only) bar, the Railroad Blues. One of my favorite Texas bands came to play, James McMurtry and the Heartless Bastards. He's an Austin, TX artist who is now gaining national popularity. They stopped through Alpine returning to Austin from a west coast tour. They are mostly rock with that Texas edge that I just adore. Good band, good friends, good location. It was a great night, but a tough day the next day. We got home at 4 am and I had to work at 7 am! Ouch, but well worth it.  3) I think my parents might kill me. For those of you who don't know, I am a bit obsessed with the art/sport/addiction of running. I have been running since I was in 8th grade and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. In the last years, I have mostly resided myself with long races, half and whole marathons. I recently decided I'd like to train for and see how fast I could run a 5k race (3.1 miles). West Texas road races are at an absolute premium; there just aren't many out here. So whenever I travel, I inquire as to whether my travels coincide with any races out in the big bad world. I will be traveling to the Hicks family reunion that is scheduled for the last weekend in June near Kankakee, IL. Wouldn't you know it, but a 5k race is scheduled for that same weekend near Kankakee as well! I think the schedule will be perfect: the family reunion is Saturday and the race on Sunday morning. Though the schedule sounds good, I still think my parents are going to kill me. "Another race, Meg? Jeez..." I can hear it now. They have a long history of being dragged into my running adventures (Think: attending high school track meets far and wide, Dad traveling from home to Chicago to watch me run a marathon, both parents traveling to Madison, WI to watch me run a marathon, both parents taking me to a half marathon race south of the Twin Cities on my last visit home, both parents driving from Minnesota to Austin, TX to see my latest marathon endeavor, it's an unending list). I hope they'll want to watch me run still!  Ok, I am off to have me a weekend. Adios, y'all.

      I had to ponder this question when, under the first light of the morning, I emerged from my dwelling to inspect the damage done from last night's mad storm. It came all at once, the only warning was cloud-to-ground lightning from the gray clouds approaching from the west. With a great whoosh of wind that lay the shrubs flat to the ground, the hail arrived. Sitting in my workplace, watching the storm roll in through the impending darkness, I head a "whomp," then another, and another, coming from the roof. I looked outside to see great hail balls bouncing off the ground. In a matter of moments, the desert floor was whitened by hail and the "whomp-ing" had evolved into banging as the hail stones grew in size. I watch the hail bounce from the ground ten feet back into the air. I watched green leaves be stripped from mesquite trees and creosotebush. I saw the small delicate annual flowers flatten to the ground almost immediately. The hail got as big as golf balls, and they were the right color too. I have to admit that the force and spirit of Mother Nature was a sight to behold in this storm, and I watched with awe.   But this morning, surveying my lawn, strewn with branches and almost all the leaves from the buckeye tree out front, with the grass flattened and crushed, I saw the true power of Mother Nature. And it didn't look pretty. The scene got even uglier when I took survey of my car. My car, rather SUV, is a 2002 Toyota 4Runner that I acquired just this February, that was almost perfect without scratch or error, now sat with dented roof, dented hood, cracked windshield, chipped back window, and dented side panels. All at once I was crushed. This car that I had invested so much in, this car that I had researched so hard on, this car that I sacrificed for, now damaged by the powerful hailstorm.   Oh well, what can I really do? I've called the insurance company and an adjuster is going to come for a visit. Hopefully the outcome will be in my favor so I can make my machine new again. But Mother Nature sure showed me her power last night and I hope to never anger her like that again.

      After much ado about not much in Meghan's world of drama, I have decided to blow the savings and purchase a road bicycle. Well, truth be told, I've already done it, several weeks ago now.  The sport was calling my name I tell you. For nearly four years at Big Bend, I've made do with one bicycle that performed multiple functions, as a mountain bike, road bike, commuter bike, etceteras. And this has been a-okay whilst in the period of my life in which fiscal responsibility was mandated by a small income. Now, heh, heh, heh, not that I make so much money now, but I do have much more money than I need, so why not use it for that which I want?  So, first I had a sit-down with the local road bike guru Mark and he gave me some pointers on where to start: read up on frame material (ie: steel, aluminum, titanium, carbon), component packages (ie: producing companies, their models, chainring and cog number and sizing), measure myself or get measured (ie: visit a bike shop and have them stick a tape measure between my legs to measure inseam and perform other measurements to determine my perfect bicycle size), and read up on bicycle accessories (ie: handlebar types, headset types, wheel types) to get knowledgeable on the subject. Then, when I came back with some knowledge, we talked and came up with an idea of the kind of bike I wanted. So it came down to forking out beaucoup dollars for a new bike from a shop or shopping online for a high-end used bike online.   I started with the cheaper option, the online bit. Mostly I searched Ebay, simply because the volume of bikes moving through Ebay is phenomenal. As time went by, I'd occasionally find what I wanted and bid, but the prices soared above what I thought were "really good deals," and I wouldn't settle.   After a while of searching, perhaps a month, I ran across this cute pink bike on Ebay that fit the bid to a tee. All except the pink bit, hah. Except its not an ugly pink, I've actually taken to its color these days. I watched the auction days tick by and the bid price remain moderately stable. On the last day, I decided to go for it, and set a maximum price that I would pay. In the last few minutes before the auction ended, it seemed as if there was one other person vying for the bike, but when it ended, I won it. It came almost immediately from a bicycle shop outside of Dallas, TX. The seller was great to deal with and the bike wonderful. I was elated when the UPS driver showed up with a bike box about 5 days later.  Here's what I got: -48 cm Aegis Arvo Svelte all carbon fiber frame with a curved seat tube, similar to 50 cm straight seat tube -Almost all Shimano Ultegra componentry with 3 chainrings for this mountain country -Sweet unknown model Shimano wheelset with Dura Ace hubs -Cane Creek headset and Salsa stem -Terry Butterfly seat and lighter than light titanium seatpost -Wiring (but no head, yet) for a Shimano Flight Deck computer system  Wow-ee, wow-ee! What a toy! And I got a super stellar deal, I'm not even going to say what a steal this bike was. So far, I love it. I love the speed and smoothness even on our rough paved roads out here. I love tucking into that beautiful aerodynamic position. I love how all my gears just swallow up the hills around here. Love it, love it, love it. But don't think I'm actually going to give up running, not gonna happen. Just an addendum to the happiness of recreational endeavor in my life. I'll keep you posted.

      I got a new car. It's a Toyota 4Runner, 2002, pewter in color, 4x4, the sport model. I've mentioned it several times now as I've written. Hopefully you won't tire of hearing about this mobile. I love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Can one really love inanimate objects? Oh yeah. They may not ever love you back, but in this case, that's just fine by me.   However, to speak with such passion about my new car without giving credit to my previous-mobile would be a dire travesty. My little Neon. My dependable mode of transport along many miles of roads stretching as far and wide as Minnesota, to Texas, to Washington state, to Alaska. I drove her hard but treated her like the queen she was; in return, she carried me safely wherever I went.   We may have had our hard times together, like when the air conditioning failed me just two months after graduating from college and with little more than a penny for a fix-the-air-conditioner fund. Or the time when a darling friend and I managed to bog her down in the wet tundra of northern Alaska. Or when the Little Neon engine, not tuned for the mountain country, just couldn't climb the nearby mountain pass without overheating.  But the joy that I've had driving that car around, I cannot rightfully express on paper. I think of the Little Neon and I think of growing up. Of proudly arriving at high school in these new wheels. Of the day my parents let me take the car to college. Of the college road trips across the Midwest. Of my Alaskan adventure, my first taste of college-graduated freedom and one of my life's greatest adventures, so far. Of my intrepid wandering to west Texas to work in a national park. Of the day my parents signed the title over to me, making the car truly my own. Of the miles and miles and miles (and miles) of deserted west Texas road driving through country of the finest kind.   The Little Neon has moved on to a new home, the booming west Texas metropolis of San Angelo, where a co-worker's daughter will continue to drive her. I was sad to see her go, but  glad that she's continuing to do her job for someone else. Though I've moved on to another car, I'll hold the Little Neon dear to my heart for a good long time. Good travels, bon voyage, bien viaje, safari njema, Little Neon.

       Well, I went, I saw, I conquered, I returned. Or something like that. I absolved myself of west Texas for 6 days for a trip to the Midwest. Most precisely, for a trip to the Hicks' Family Reunion. It all started last Thursday, when I headed north (because south isn't really an option in these parts unless you'd like to illegally navigate oneself across the Rio Grande and into Mexico) to catch an outbound plane. The extravaganza wrapped itself up on Tuesday evening when I plummeted myself back into reality and the Big Bend. Here's the rest of the story:   Thursday, 6/24: Woke up early with the intention of doing a track workout in Fort Stockton on my way north, of getting town shopping done in the Midland/Odessa area, of, perhaps, taking in an evening movie. Got the moderately early start part accomplished as I bid farewell to June the Border Collie. She was to be taken care of by her trusty friend Dave, who she dearly loves because he never ceases to play fetch with her. It's a very simple dynamic. Got out of the park about 10:30 am and signed off on a Fort Stockton track workout. My 12:30 pm arrival there was greeted by hot, hot, hot weather, high humidity, and impending thunderstorms. I continued north and decided I'd find a track for an evening workout in Midland. Got to town and went to town on all the shopping I needed. By the time I finished, it was about 5:30 pm and the heavens were opening up in a display of electricity and water that would challenge the likes of Broadway. The flooded streets, dark skies, and rain downpours moved my track workout inside to the treadmill of my hotel, doing a slightly modified version of "The Perfect Mile" workout. Today, for me, it went like this: 2 mi warm up at 18 min, 1x1600 at 6:30 min/mi pace, 4 min recovery jog, 1x1200 at 6:30 min/mi pace, 3 min recovery jog, 1x800 at 6:30 min/mi pace, 2 min recovery jog, 1x400 at 6:00 min/mi pace, 1.5 mi slow cool down at 14 min. Then dinner and crash out for an early flight.  Friday, 6/25: An early wake-up call to make it on the 6:40 am flight outta town. Ugh, I don't do early mornings well. Made it uneventfully to Houston for a plane change, but ended up with several hours of delays there due to weather. Apparently, Houston is experiencing a Noah quality and volume flood of epic proportions. The weather didn't stop on this morning, and I found myself a few hours delayed getting to Chi-town. Got there half expecting my ride to have abandoned me or something similar, but to my joy, I quickly found my family doing the arrivals-door hover, waiting for me. Together we joined forces and drove south to Bourbonnais, IL, about 1 1/2 hours south of Chicago, near where the Hicks family is from. Got there just in time to join one of the many pre-family reunion events, dinner out. Afterwards, the pre-reunion get-together continued itself back at the hotel, but I excused myself after a bit and hit the sack. 4:45 am came too early this morning! No run today, no time due to travel and family constraints.  Saturday: Made it out for a morning 5 miler, slow pace, total 45 minutes. Resting up for Sunday's 5K race. The family reunion started at 12:30 pm, which meant that set-up and pre-reunion activities started at about 11 am. The family reunion was an absolute hoot. I got to see relatives who I hadn't seen in years. The perpetual phenomenon of the family reunion experience is that it makes everyone feel older. I can't tell you how many times my relatives looked at me and said something similar to, "Wow! You sure have grown up in these last years!" while I looked at other relatives (the younger ones, anyway) and noted the same thing. I guess that's okay, though! We had a great feast of your typical picnic foods, spent lots of time chatting, even had a water balloon toss, and generally enjoyed ourselves in the heat and humidity of June in the Midwest. Late afternoon arrived and we rounded out the family reunion and headed back to the hotel. That evening, my mother and I went out to run errands and happened upon the preparations for a fireworks display. We parked the car and watched the show, an added treat for the day!  Sunday: 6:30 am wake-up and a 7:00 am departure for the Bourbonnais Friendship Festival 5K. I'd never run a 5K before and since this one was scheduled for right down the street from the hotel, I decided to enter. Not really having trained for a 5K, (I'm more of a distance chica than anything), I just decided to go out and run as fast as I could. Not a bad proposition. Did a 1.5 mile warm-up and some striders, before the 8 am gun. Actually, not really a gun, just a holler. There were some high school cross country boys that really flew out, but I found my pace after dodging some folks going at slower paces. I learned there that next time I should line up closer to the front. A high school-aged girl was immediately in front of me and I could see I couldn't keep her pace, so I let her go. The race was winding through neighborhood streets, with little hills here and there, and lots and lots of turns. So many turns they slowed you down! With a little over a mile to go, another high school-aged girl passed me, just barely. I could see that I could keep pace with her and so I did, tailing and staying even with her the rest of the way. Ran through an incredibly smoky spot, someone was burning something! Got the biggest cotton mouth ever from the smoke and had to stop for some water at the last station. Good thing for me that others had to as well. That was a little bizarre-o. The last 400 meters or so was on a straightaway to the finish line and the little cross country chica out-kicked me. So I crossed the line the third female. The time said 21:29, but I learned after the fact that they'd started the clock "about 30 seconds" late, so everyone's times were "about 30 seconds" too slow. So, 21 minutes flat, or so. I was pleased with my performance. I was also psyched to see my mother cross the finish line in her 2 mile fitness walk. Go mom, yeah! Headed back to the hotel, where I did a cooldown run and quick shower to get ready for my cousin Lindsey's shower. Oh yeah, and I had to do her flower arrangements too, fast! The shower/luncheon was just great. I had a blast and I think everyone else did too. Aunt Pat and Stephanie put on a great shower. After the shower, clean-up, and lingering chatter in the hotel, we said good-bye to the extended family and headed northbound to Milwaukee. We made it, just barely, after checking into our hotel and rushing to downtown Milwaukee for Summerfest, to meet Dori and Tom at the appointed place and time. The heavens opened up on us in the middle of dinner in a good steady rain/drizzle, and didn't quit the rest of the night. The west Texas band, The Flatlanders, who we came to see, came on at 10 pm and played to an entirely drenched crowd. We all had fun and, luckily, managed to stay (mostly) warm until the end of the evening. Afterwards, we all tucked our tails and headed back to the hotel, to put on dry clothes and collapse exhausted into bed. Dori and Tom headed home and we would catch up with them in the morning.  Monday: We were all a little tired, sleeping in a bit. I did a quick run on the hotel treadmill, and found that my legs were a little sore from yesterday's race. A good sore, though! We wound up in Burlington in time for lunch, so we went out to a little cafe with Dori and Tom. Great sandwiches/soup later, they gave us a mini-tour of downtown Burlington. Had to say good-bye to my parents and brother, who were Minnesota-bound today. They left me, though, in good hands with Dori and Tom. In the afternoon, Dori and I visited a mushroom farm (there's a first time for everything, how fun!) and walked several miles along the shore of Lake Geneva, gawking at all the mansions and picking out the ones we most wanted to live in. In the evening, we returned to Burlington and went out for Chinese. That was my idea, but I think Tom wanted to bless me, it seems he really like that place. Afterwards, we went to Burlington's movie theater to see the third Harry Potter movie. What this movie lacked in plot, it made up for in special effects. Collapsed into another night of exhaustion afterwards, this traveling business tires you out!  Tuesday: Awoke early to find the sun already risen in Burlington, so I laced my shoes for a trot around town. I couldn't tell you where I ran, all I know is that I ran and I eventually made it back to Dori and Tom's home. Thank goodness. These kind souls then had to drive my sorry behind all the way to Midway Airport to catch my flight home. We made it to Midway's neighborhood with lots of time to spare, so we stopped in to a little cafe for some breakfast. Amidst our chatter and banter, we forgot about the time and found ourselves still sitting there with only an hour to spare before my flight! Ack! Tom put it in high gear and drove like a bat out of hell. I hope his tires still had rubber after that endeavor. A quick good-bye and thank you to them and I found myself at the back of a massive check-in line, with only 30 minutes till my flight. In a moment of uncharacteristic assertiveness (or was it aggression?), I walked straight to the front of the line and up to the next ticket agent. Go Meghan! I checked in and they told me to run, so I did. A short hang-up in security and I found myself at the gate with 15 minutes to spare and staring at a sign that read "flight delayed." I caught my breath and found a chair to wait. Apparently the Houston airport was still under some nasty weather. We eventually made it to Houston about an hour late, which was no problem for making my flight to Midland. Arriving in Midland at about 6 pm, I claimed my car from the airport hotel and headed home, stopping off at the grocery for some fresh produce, and arriving home about 10 pm. Dave was so nice to leave June the Border Collie waiting for me at home. What a lovely thing it is to have a creature greet you with unconditional love and affection, making you feel like the greatest human being alive! I'm always glad to go, but also glad to come home. With a deep sigh of relief, it felt good to climb into my own bed tonight.
