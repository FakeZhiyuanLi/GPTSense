      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ I sat down on the sofa with two mugs of coffee steaming in front of me and with my father sitting in the seat next to me. The both of us were in his hotel suite.  "Hebe, I came to New Zealand for a reason, you should know that." He began while I sank deeper into the seat, dreading what he would say next, but all the while I kept silent, not knowing what to say.  "To tell you the truth, i'm losing money, like seriously losing money, almost going bankrupt." He said, his voice carried no regret nor any sadness or anger.  It must have been because he was spending all his money on those little mistresses he got and not caring about work at all. It would just be a surprise he doesn't go bankrupt. I thought about what he was saying, does he want me back at Taiwan to do something to help rise his profits again?  Seeing I had no response, he continued, "I want you to marry into the Okaedo family." I stood up immediately from the seat, my left hand clutching my other hand tightly.   "Wh-What did you say?" I spluttered, feeling every nerve and muscle in my body tense and my breathing starting to be uneven.   "I want you to marry Takeshi Okaedo, young master of Okaedo Corporation. As you know, they have a big company at Japan and they are extremely rich, you would live a great life there." My father said, deadpanned. He sounds as if I'm for sure going to marry Takeshi or something! No way!  "I was never born into a good life. Never once in my life I actually felt it was good! And I'm not marrying." I retorted rudely.  "You have no say in this! I had already talked it out with Mr Okaedo, and we will be in-laws in less than a month." He stood up too, and glared at me with anger. But his anger couldn't measure up to mine.  What the hell. How could he decide my marriage just like that? "I have no say!!! Which century is this! No one lets their their parents decide their marriage already! This is my life, my marriage, so if I say I don't want, I don't." I glared back at him, anger rising up in my chest.   My father doesn't respect me at all! This is my marriage, and without my consent, he had decided everything for me. The guy, the date, everything! Really, if eyes could kill, my glare would have shot him dead right there just then. I was that furious!  "There is no way you can say no. The wedding date has been confirmed, the wedding place has already been booked and the banquet and everything had already been planned. And, of course the invitations are already out, so you can't say no. If you don't agree, it would be a disgrace to our family, as well as the Okaedos." He said in a monotone, his face still expressionless.   "What!" I spat out, "You did all these without even telling me! And my relatives and so called friends are supposed to know about my wedding before I do! What kind of father are you? How can you spoil my life like-"  Piak. He slapped me. Right across the face. Hard. He must have been really angry, angry enough to slap me? I felt a stinging pain on my cheek and knew that it was red and swollen, causing tears to form at the corner of my eyes. "Don't you dare talk to me using that kind of tone. I say you marry and you do." He said before going into the bedroom of his hotel suite and banged the door.  I quickly brushed away my tears, grabbed my stuff and ran out of the suite. There was no use in staying here.. And I don't feel like going home, facing Selina with my swollen cheek..  Where can I go? Shawn.. He was the first person that came to my mind..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  When two hearts come together, they beat as one. But when one heart leaves, the other heart crumbles and withers to death. In love, 1+1=1. And 2-1=0.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+ Today was Valentine's Day.. Couples were strolling slowly down the streets, holding hands and acting intimately, shops were filled with red and pink decorations..  Louis and I were invited by Hebe and Selina to go to their house to celebrate Friendship Day, not Valantine's Day.. Well, It's nice to be with Hebe on this day, so I'm not asking for much..  "Hey, people! Dinner is ready!" Selina shouted from the dining room and the rest of us stood up from the couch and walked to the dining table, which had a candle brightly lit in the middle and dishes placed around it.  "Wow," that was what came out of Louis' mouth and I could see that Selina was blushing slightly.  "Should we switch off the lights for more ambience?" Hebe asked, laughing.   Selina turned even redder and she changed the subject, "Take a seat, don't just stand there." We did. Selina and Hebe were sitting next to each other and I was opposite Hebe, Louis was opposite Selina. Hebe's face looked radiant against the candle light, but I knew she was just faking it, she was still troubled by her father's sudden arrival.  "You know, our dear Selina does not cook such delicious dishes all the time.. So you two are fortunate today!" Hebe grinned, teasing Selina.  I laughed, knowing Hebe was indirectly teasing both Selina and Louis. The both of them looked perfect together, and they had chemistry.. But I guess they have not known their own feelings yet, and Selina is afraid to love..  During the dinner, we talked and Hebe had hardly took a look at me, I knew she was avoiding my gaze... But why? Maybe it was because I knew that she was just faking her happiness? I shrugged inwardly. But sooner or later, Selina and Louis would know that Hebe's father is here, in New Zealand.. Because Jimmy is working on the article..  I was still praying hard that what Jimmy had assmued was not true..  "Hey, Shawn! Why are you spacing out?" Louis waved a hand in front of me, making me blink. "Huh? What were you all talking about?" I asked, causing them to laugh.  Then, Selina's face suddenly scrunched up in pain and she stood up and ran to the toilet. Huh. What was going on? Hebe sighed, "Morning sickness." Ohh, I almost forgot that Selina was pregnant..   "She's been like that for many days.. The doctor says its normal, but I'm still worried though.." Hebe shook her head and put down her fork, having no appetite.  Then, Selina came out of the toilet, looking green and it seems like she lost her appetite too..  "Since everyone lost their appetite, then why don't we go to the beach for a stroll?" I suggested, causing everyone to look at me. "I agree." Hebe spoke up and I felt surprised that she was the one to agree.  +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  Half an hour later, the four of us were strolling on the beach. Selina and Louis walked first, followed by Shawn and I. Silence filled the gap between the two of us. I guessed he was thinking of that incident in the airport... Once I put up my father in a hotel, I told him I was busy and would not be free for the next few days. I was lying, I just wanted to avoid him as long as possible..  I knew I could not avoid the truth for long, but I also knew that the truth hurts too much..  Both of us remained that way throughout the whole walk. I figured there was too much on both our minds.  As Selina and I got home, and Louis and Shawn both went home too, the both of us retreated back to our rooms.. I slumped onto the bed and stared at the ceiling blankly, tears forming in my eyes. Valentine's Day.. Edison.. Me.. Stringing the three together, what I got was just wonderful memories of Edison.. I quickly brushed away the tears and was about to change out of my clothes when I saw a beautifully wrapped box on my table.  I picked it up and looked around, there wasn't any note.. I tore apart the wrapping paper, careful not to damage it. A note fell out from it and I read it. "To Hebe from Shawn. Happy Valentine's Day."   The gift was a big heart with the words "Find your happiness" on it. It was just a small little gesture, but it touched my heart and I felt sweetened. As I hugged the heart to my chest, I slowly drifted off to sleep.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  When I found you, I found the closest thing to heaven.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Selina's Point Of View]_+  Louis took me to a beautiful restaurant for dinner. It was extremely romantic and the ambience was soothing. There were candles brightly lit on every table. Other than the candle light, there was little light in the restaurant. There were a few New Zealanders dining there.  A waiter led us to a solitaire table next to the window and Louis helped me pull a chair out for me to sit. Smiling at him, I sat down. And he did likewise. "What would sir and miss like?" The waiter asked, handing us a copy of the menu each.  "Selina, what would you like?" Louis asked me. "Anything." I answered, looking at the menu.  Louis turned to the waiter, "Do you have anything to recommend?"  "Um, the chef has just came up with a Couple's Meal since Valentine's Day is around the corner." The waiter suggested, making Louis and I blush.  "Do you mind?" Louis asked me awkwardly. I nodded mutely. "Okay, we would order that then.." Louis handed the menu back to the waiter. I did the same and the waiter left.   There was an awkward pause between us.. And I looked out of the window. The streets were deserted, the only lights came from the pubs which only open during the night. Then, I saw a girl and a guy walking out of a pub. The guy had an arm around the girl's shoulder. The guy was staggering, putting his weight on the girl.   Looking closely, I saw that the guy was Ahdi, the last person I would expect to see again. I stared blankly at the scene. It was breaking my heart piece by piece, making it bleed fiercely. I felt tears brimming in my eyes, so I looked away, unable to continue looking at that painful scene.  +_[Louis's Point Of View]_+  I saw that Selina had tears in her eyes.. Why? I looked out of the window to where she had just looked. I saw a couple acting intimately, walking down the street. I glanced back at Selina who was trying very hard to hold back her tears.  We were silent for very long, then she spoke up, "That was my husband. No, I should say ex-husband." Her voice trembled as she said that. I glanced out of the window again to get a closer look, but the couple was out of sight.   "Selina?" I asked, peering into her face. She was drying her tears and looked up at me with red and swollen eyes. "Are you okay?"  "You know, all along, I thought I had forgotten him.. But after just now, I knew that I hadn't got over him one bit.." Selina said miserably.  I stretched across the table and patted her hand, "Don't worry, Selina. You will get over him."  Selina looked baffled at my actions, but she answered, "I'm not worrying. I know I will get over him, but not soon enough."  I nodded my head, not knowing what to say. I was never good at consoling people, not like Shawn...  When the meal came, the both of us ate silently. The happy mood had vanished because of the sight of Selina's ex-husband...  _________________________________________  +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  I was alone in the house. Selina had gone out with Louis. Being alone, my thoughts drifted off easily..  The phone rang, breaking into my thoughts. I picked it up, "Hello?"  "Hello? Xiao jie?" A voice I couldn't recognize came into earshot.   "Huh? Who is this?" I asked into the receiver.  "It's Kunda, your housekeeper." The voice said once again. And indeed, it was Kunda. He was my housekeeper since forever. I haven't heard his voice since I left for New Zeland.. Oh, how I missed his voice!  "Kunda! Why are you calling me? How are you?" I shouted into the phone.  "Xiao jie, I am fine. I am just calling you to inform you that laoye is going to New Zealand." Kunda answered.  "What!" I shouted even louder into the phone. "Why?"  "I'm not sure. But his flight is tomorrow."   "Tomorrow! Why is he coming here? What is his motive? And why so soon?" I asked hurriedly.  "I don't know, xiao jie." Kunda replied simply, making me sink down into the couch.  "Okay Okay. Thanks, kunda, for calling."  "You're welcome, xiao jie. And, xiao jie, lao ye isn't in a very good mood.." Kunda said before he hung up.  I put the receiver down, feeling frustrated and confused. "Why would my father come to New Zealand for?"  Please.. don't let it be anything gotta do with me..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Desires are one thing, dreams are another.

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  I knew I must look stupid, but whatever. I just wanted to get to him as fast as possible.  "Mr.. Okaedo!" I greeted as I took in deep breaths sharply, panting from all the running.  He looked at me with this weird expression on his face. Then, he looked as if he was enlightened, his mouth in an oval. I was amused by his exaggerated actions but bit the side of my mouth to stop myself from laughing.  "Oh, it's Miss Tian am I right?" He asked, raising his perfectly arched eyebrows. He was really handsome, with sharp features that were just perfect for his face and high cheekbones. Surprisingly, his voice did not carry the Japanese accent his dad's carries. We walked into the hotel together.  "Yes, glad you still remember me. But it's kind of hard to forget me, isn't it?" I gave a weak smile.  That made him laugh, his laughter was rich and full of enthusiasism. "Yes, I'm sure. Anyway, call me Takeshi." He grinned at me.  Wow, his grin lit his whole face up, making all the seriousness disappear.  **NOTE-- Mr Okaedo's son is takeshi kaneshiro. The guy who acted in turn left turn right. =)**  "Um, the reason why I'm here is because I think I am very wrong to slap Mr Okaedo, and I'm sincerely hoping he was not going to sue me." I said, swallowing down the words "not true". I knew that in order for me not to be in trouble, I have to admit my 'mistakes'.  He laughed again, his eyes crinkling with merriment. His laughter somehow make my skin tingle and made me blush. "Um, he did want to sue you, but I convinced him not to, after all it isn't your fault, it's his. You needn't take blame."  I heaved a sigh of relief. This was going much easier than I thought. "Thanks so much Takeshi. You wouldn't know how much that helps me."  "It's okay.." He said seriously, "But, Miss Tian.. He won't sue you.. but the deal between our company and your company is off."  My face fell. Oh no. I'd just lost one of my company's biggest clients, I'm getting fired for sure. I didn't answer him, I didn't exactly know how to answer.  "I'm sorry Miss Tian," He said apologetically, causing me to look up at him in surprise.  "Why do you say that?" I questioned, "It has nothing gotta do with you."  "Please don't mind my father. He has been like that ever since my mother died. Ever since my mother died, he wasn't himself anymore, he never tried to let anyone into his world. He never loved anyone again, not even me.." He sighed, and his voice carried sadness. I could see that he belonged in a very happy family. But it was all broken when his mother died.  When my mother died, I never cried. At all. Because I knew that my mother did not love me. All she cares about is work. And I didn't care about her either.. My father, likewise. He had an affair and he did not care about the family at all, he didn't even know what goes on in the family. My parents only knew how to buy toys for me. They had never gave me enough love. I grew up in a very unloving family.  After being lost in our own thoughts for a minute, we both snapped back to reality. And I was back to my problem.  "Well, thanks Takeshi. You've helped me already. I could really do without your father suing me. It can't be helped if I lost him as a client though.." I shrugged my shoulders nonchantly, although in my heart, I was feeling extremely frustrated. "Bye. Nice talking to you." I said before walking out of the hotel doors, without waiting for Takeshi's reply.  Sigh. I'm really going to lose my job. I was not even that outstanding in the first place.. If I lose my job.. What would I do? Go back to my own country? No.. it held memories of my past.. I didn't want to go back to my past.. And my father was also at Taiwan.  Staying here is worse, it would remind me of Edison and the times we had together.. But I've got friends here.. Selina can go back to Taiwan with me, I'm sure.. But Shawn? I know that I was going to miss him, as a friend, I mean.  Okay okay, maybe I would get to keep my job? Nah, that's impossible. Without Mr Okaedo, the company is like losing almost half of the profits.. It would be a miracle if they don't fire me..   What am I supposed to do?  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Part of loving someone is to learn to let go.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ I woke up with my back aching. Squinting at the bright sunlight, I blinked a few times to clear my vision. Then, I felt something heavy pressing on my shoulder. Glancing sideways, I saw Shawn's head resting on my shoulder. I blushed slightly and tapped Shawn's shoulder lightly.  Sigh. He won't wake up.. So I sat there awkwardly and stared at the sea blankly. "What am I supposed to do? Will I get fired? But I can't afford to lose this job.. Maybe I should apologize to him? But that won't work, he is so angry already.. maybe he would even do other pervetic stuff to me!"  I thought for very long, then I had an idea. I could go find Mr Okaedo's son! Maybe he would help me.. But would he? I just have to chance it.. I shifted my body in excitement. Then, I felt the heavy weight lifted off my body. Turning, I saw Shawn's body lying on the sand. He was stirring. Shawn's jacket had also fallen back into the sand.  Eh, oops. I didn't mean that.  Shawn had already woke up. He scratched his head. "He looked so cute doing that.. Damn. What am I thinking?" I scolded myself.  "What happened?" He asked in a weary tone.  "I'm sorry. I shifted my position, accidently waking you up.." I responded with a sheepish smile.  "Oh... doesn't matter.." Shawn bit his lip, his face turning slightly red. He probably didn't get used to the idea of sleeping on my shoulder...  "Oh yes, anyway.. thanks for accompanying me yesterday.." I said gratefully. Without Shawn, I wonder what would happened to me last night?  "It's nothing. Oh no! I'm late for work!" Shawn glanced at his watch and scrambled to a standing position, picking up his jacket "I'm sorry I can't accompany you anymore."  "It's my fault that you're late for work.. Go now!" I said apologetically.  "Bye," He said before turning and running towards the main road to hail a cab.  Sigh.. I lay back down on the sand. It seems that the only idea is to approach Mr Okaedo's son to help...  __________________________________________  Raising my eyebrows at the grand hotel that stood in front of me, I reluctantly entered it. I asked the reception, "Excuse me, can you tell me where's Mr Okaedo's room?"  "Um, I'm sorry.. I can't divulge the customer's information." The brunette miss around her mid twenties answered.  "Okay.. Thanks anyway." I said as I walked away and slumped onto a chair. Maybe I should wait for him or something?   _______________________30 MINUTES LATER_________________  Wow. Can't believe I actually waited for so long.. But I had nothing to do anyway, I didn't want to go to work... Sigh.. I should go.. I don't want to wait until I meet that mad old man before I meet his son..   I stood up and walked towards the entrance. What a waste of time.. I thought as I was about to exit the hotel. Then, I saw Mr Okaedo's son walking towards the entrance. What a coincidence! I'm so lucky!  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  As long as there is breath in the world, there is always hope.   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ "Miss Tian!! Please hurry, you're late for your meeting with Mr Okaedo!!" Ella said anxiously as I ran into my office. I was late for work, damn damn damn, I'm never late for work.. What was wrong with my alarm clock? Whatever, it isn't time to think about this..  I put down my stuff and searched hurriedly for the proposal I typed out yesterday. Yes! Found it! I pulled a purple file out of the stack and rushed towards the conference room, with Ella at my heels.  Opening the conference doors, I saw Mr Okaedo and another guy sitting there staring at me. I hoped I didn't see hatred in their eyes.. Tucking my stray strands of hair behind my ear, I walked forward a little and took a bow, "I'm sorry Mr Okaedo, I'm late.."  Mr Okaedo smiled at me, revealing his ugly yellow teeth. It wasn't a friendly kinda smile, it was those kinda cunning smile, that made me wary of him. "Sit down, it doesn't matter.." He said in a japanese accent and gestured towards the seat next to him.  "Uh, I shall sit here.."I took the seat opposite him, with the conference table in between us.  "I'll go make the refreshments. What would you like, Mr Okaedo?" Ella asked Mr Okaedo politely.  "Anything will do.." He said dissmissively while still staring at me. I nodded pointedly for Ella to get the refreshments and looked down at her proposal while Ella left. I felt extremely uncomfortable as Mr Okaedo continued staring at me.  Clearing my throat, I opened the document and started to explain the details to Mr Okaedo. But he cut me off, "Don't talk 'bout work first, do you wanna go to the k box later?"   There isn't any k box in New Zealand, moron. That was what I wanted to say, but I swallowed it down and said politely while faking a stiff smile, "Um, no thanks, Mr Okaedo. Let's talk about work first, then, we can talk about other things okay?"  He looked disgruntled, but he agreed. Squirming in my seat, I looked up at that guy sitting beside Mr Okaedo, who I guessed was his son. He looked a little sympathetic at my situation, but other than that, his whole face was expressionless. Hey! What's wrong with him! I looked down at the proposal again and tried to explain the details all over again. But I felt worse because that mad man's eyes won't leave my face.  "So, this is our proposal, do we have an agreement? If we do, please sign it.." I wanted to end this as quickly as possible. I passed him the file and the pen. He reached in, not to take the pen, but to touch my hand.   Luckily, I noticed his action and quickly withdrew my hand, letting the pen drop on the table. Blinking hard and swallowing, I told myself. Bear with it. Bear with it. You can't afford to lose this client..  At the same time, Ella opened the doors with her back and came in with two cups of coffee. Phew.. I'm sure that pevertic man don't dare to do anything with Ella around.   Just as Ella put down the cups of coffee, I felt something pressing against my leg. Shocked, I looked down and saw the stupid man's foot stroking my leg. It sent uncomfortable shivers down my spine. I couldn't stand it anymore..   I stood up in anger, causing my chair to make a loud screech. I reached forward and gave the idiotic man a hard slap across the face, then, I lifted up the cup of boiling coffee and splashed it onto his face, making him yell and splutter. His face must have been disfigured by the hot boiling coffee, but I don't care. I didn't even care about the consequences anymore..   With tears boiling in my eyes, I burst out of the conference room and ran all the way out of the office building. Someone was chasing me, and I had an idea who. Ella.  I turned back to face her, wiping the tears out of my eyes. "What did you do that for?" Ella asked me in a shocked tone.  "He was stroking my foot with his! And all his pevertic actions, I couldn't stand it anymore.. You wouldn't be able to stand it either.." I clenched my jaw and walked away from her, knowing that my job was finished, it was completely over.. I had offended one of our most important clients..   Half of me regret my actions, half of me didn't.. He really deserved it.. but I didn't deserve whatever punishment my office has for me..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Life isn't like a video tape, where you can replay the good moments and fast-foward the bad ones..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ Life is just like a maze, sometimes you would get lost, but there is always a way out.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+  Running towards the pub where Hebe is at, I glanced at my watch. 12.04. I wondered why Hebe was so depressed that she has to go drinking? She called me half an hour ago in a very tired tone, asking me to accompany her. I felt really shocked that she was in a pub.  Half an hour.. She could have drank like a dozen mugs of beer already. I skidded to a stop in front of a brightly lit small pub. Through the glass, I could see Hebe taking a swig of beer from the counter and gulping it down her throat. Feeling angry and a little shocked, I pushed the doors open and dashed into the pub.  No one bothered to look up, I guess there were a lot of weird happenings going on around in the pub. I walked over to Hebe and snatched the mug out of her hand, spilling some beer onto my hand.   Hebe's face was red all the way down to her neck and her neck was full of rashes and she was scratching at them uncomfortably. She squinted at me before snatching the mug back, "What do you want?" She asked in a monotone. I stared hard at her, she wasn't Hebe, she was a totally different person, I do not know this Hebe..  "Stop drinking!" I commanded, gripping her shoulders tightly and forced her to look directly into my eyes. There were so much sadness in her eyes that I felt my grip on her shoulder soften.  "You want to know what happened to me?" She asked dreamily, giving a slight hiccup. When I didn't reply, she continued, "That stupid pervetic man!! How dare he do his stupid little actions..." She raved, letting the sentence trail.  Huh. What was she talking about? I wondered. "Who was the stupid pervetic man? And what did he do?" I impeached curiously, looking at Hebe who was hiccuping uncontrollably.  "He is the company's client.. And he stroked my foot!!!" She answered impatiently.  I widened my eyes in shock, "What? And what did you do?"  "I-I.. I just slap-ped h-him and poured t-the c-coffee ov-over him.." She said in between hiccups and giggled after she finished her sentence. If the situation wasn't so serious, the scene would have looked amusing. "H-He de-deserved i-it!" Hebe lifted the beer and brought to the her mouth again.  Frowning, I took the beer away and grabbed Hebe's hand, "C'mon, let's get out of here."  "Where are you pulling me?" Hebe asked, but she followed me slowly, trailing behind me, dragging her feet. I pulled Hebe out of the pub and onto the deserted streets.  We walked this way until we reached the beach. That beach that we met. The sea and the sky were the same dull colour, making it hard to differentiate, except for the twinkling stars up in the sky. I knew that I was still holding onto Hebe's hand, because I was enjoying every moment of it.  Suddenly, I felt Hebe yank her hand away. I looked back at her in surprise, and I found her barfing, her hand placed on her chest. I patted her back, "Are you okay? Feel better?"  "Empty. I feel empty after puking all the contents out." Hebe said simply and continued walking ahead of me, causing me to follow her. Then, she sat down on the sand and I did likewise.  "Look." She pointed up to the sky. I looked towards the direction of her finger and saw many beautiful stars and constellations glittering down at me.  How beautiful, this sight is so rare..   "You know that formation there? That's the Orion. It's beautiful, isn't it?" Hebe's finger jerked towards her right, making me look at the Orion.  "Yes, it is beautiful. How did you know all these stuff?" I asked curiously, amazed at her knowledge.  "A friend once taught me. He was painting the stars, it was absolutely beautiful.." Hebe closed her eyes and I knew she was feeling the cool breeze brush against her skin.  "Who was your friend?" I asked out of curiosity. Who had such wonderful talent of painting? He must have been her boyfriend or something..  "My friend?" Hebe repeated, opening her eyes and staring at the sky, "He.. He was a very talented artist.."  Talented artist? I didn't know what to say. It was apparent that she did not want to talk much about her friend, but I desperately wanted to know. That talented artist must have meant a lot to her..  We kept silent for very long, she didn't say anything either.. Then, I felt something heavy drop onto my shoulder. Looking sideways, I saw Hebe's head resting on my shoulder, she was sleeping. She looked really innocent and angelic with her eyes closed, her lashes standing out against her white flawless skin.  Smiling contendedly, I wrapped my jacket over her shoulders and drifted slowly off to sleep too.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Friendship is like the stars in the sky, they will always be there for you, and will shine for you. Sometimes, heavy dark clouds will cover them from your vision, but it doesn't mean that the stars aren't there..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+ I screwed open the cough syrup bottle cap and eyed it before bringing it to my mouth and swallowing the whole thing down painfully.  "Hey, hey!" Hebe held onto my arm and pulled it back, "You can't drink it like that!"  We were in that cafe near the beach now. It was our second time there, I'm not sure why, but both of us just like that place alot.. It was my first week of work.. And I was sick like a puppy, what luck!  "Then, what way am I supposed to drink it?" I grumbled, as she let go of my hand and snatched the bottle away from me. Both of us were quite close friends now, I guess...  "Drinking so much of it at once will just make it worse.." She lectured as she closed the bottle cap on the bottle and putting it aside, "How did you get so sick, anyway?"  I coughed dryly, "I don't know.. Just caught some virus.."  Hebe sipped slowly on her drink, "If you ask me, I would think that it's cause you haven't been working for a long time, so that once you start work, you just fall sick.." She gave a reproving expression.  Chuckling, I agreed, "Actually, I think you're right.. Oh yes, How's your friend now?"  +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  "Well, she's sad, definitely, but, I think she's getting better.. Time heals, I guess.." I said wryly, silently, I didn't agree with myself, and I marvelled at how Selina was coping without Ahdi. She seemed okay this morning, she even seemed cheerful..   The bell on the door rang, indicating that someone had just came into the cafe. I ignored it, wanting to say something to Shawn, when Shawn shouted, "Louis!" and waved at someone.  I turned back to see a tall, dark and handsome man standing next to Selina. Huh. Did I see wrongly? Selina? What was she doing here?!?! And who's that Louis guy? They walked over to our table.  "Hey Shawn! How you doing?" That Louis guy asked Shawn and they grinned at each other. They must be really good friends, I figured. "Selina, What are you doing here?" I asked Selina in confusion.  "Hebe. What a coincidence! Meet Louis, my friend.." She introduced Louis. I shook hands politely with him.  "Hi, I'm Hebe." I smiled politely, "Wanna join us?" I gestured towards the empty chairs beside Shawn and me.  "Sure." They grinned and took the seats. Once Selina was sitting next to me, I hissed in her ear, "What're you doing here, Se? You're supposed to be at home resting!"  "I don't wanna rest. I've rested enough.. The doctor says I need exercise, anyway..." Selina shrugged as she answered softly into my ear. We must have looked quite weird, because Shawn and Louis were both staring at us.  "You know Selina?" Louis asked me. I felt weird. Shouldn't I be the one who was asking that question? Where did Selina get to know Louis? There were not many Chinese in New Zeland..  "She's a very close friend of mine.." I answered simply, sipping on my drink.  "Oh, Okay.. Louis is a very close friend of mine too.. Looks like its sorta like destiny huh?" Shawn asked with his eyebrows raised. Actually, I silently agreed with him.. It was sorta weird how we four could actually know each other..  ________________________________________  +_[Louis' Point Of View]_+  "It's very coincidental that the four of us actually met, don't you think?" Selina asked me, indicating Shawn, Hebe, her and me. The two of us were walking on the streets.  "Yeah," I agreed, "It's very coincidental.. Anyway, what were you and Hebe whispering about just now in the cafe?"  "Eh.. I don't know if I should keep this from you anymore.." Selina started, an uncomfortable expression on her face.  I paused, waiting for her to continue. "Well, on that day, when I was crying.." She looked at me to see if I was following. I nodded. "Well, I had just divorced with my husband.. And, well, I'm pregnant.. "  "Oh?" I said simply, frowning and taking the information in.  "That day I found out, I also found out that my husband was cheating on me.. So, when I knew I was pregnant, my husband wanted to get back together with me again.. But I divorced him.. Because he didn't love me, he will only love the baby.." She choked out the last sentence. I looked sideways at her and saw that a spring of tears had formed at the corners of her eyes.  She had such a sad past.. How can her husband be so heartless? If I was him, I wouldn't even dream of cheating on such a beautiful and nice wife like Selina. What are you thinking, Louis? I questioned myself.  "I'm sorry, didn't mean to get emotional." Selina blinked the tears away and looked at me.  I flashed her a friendly smile, "Don't worry, everyone has their bad moments.. including me, as well.."  She returned a beautiful smile and we continued walking.  When we reached the outside of a gift shop, Selina suddenly stopped in her tracks and pointed towards the display window in the gift shop. "Look, Louis.. Those bears.. They're so cute!!!" She cried, pointing at a pair of bears which were in bridal costume.  I laughed at her, she looked so cute and innocent, just like a child.. She looked so innocent as she ogled over the cute bears, like a child that had no worries, she wasn't like that Selina a few minutes ago, who was crying over a heartless man that cheated on her..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  True love is like ghosts.. which everyone talks about, but only a few sees..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Louis' Point Of View]_+ I didn't know what to do, I didn't even know where to place my hands, they were just flinging around.. I didn't even know what I was doing.. Selina was sobbing really hard now, and her breathing was uneven..   I just stared blankly at her, waiting for her to stop crying.. I hate it when girls cry in front of me, I don't know how to comfort them..   Finally she wiped her tears. "I-I-I'm s-so-sorr.. sorryy.." She choked out softly before more tears spilled out of her eyes again.   I knew I had to do something.. Pushing the hair out of my eyes, I got out of the taxi and opened the backseat door, then, I entered the taxi again, now sitting beside Selina. I patted her shoulder gingerly, not knowing what to do.. After a few minutes, Selina went all quiet again, making me peer into her face.   "I'm really sorry.. I.. I just needed a good cry.." Selina said, her eyes still red and puffy from all the crying.  "It doesn't matter, really." I said quickly, "Sometimes, everyone needs a good cry.. Cry it all out, nothing to be embarassed about.."  Selina nodded gratefully, managing a weak smile, "Thanks." She got up to leave the cab.  "Wait," I held onto her arm, "You're very frustrated, aren't you.. Let me show you a place.." She looked at me curiously.  ______________________________________  +_[Selina's Point Of View]_+  "Here.." Louis led me to a beautiful beach. I recognized it to be Hebe's favourite beach, where she met Edison.   "Why lead me here?" I asked curiously.   Louis went over to a fallen log and sat down, then to turned to me and pat the space beside him. I sat down beside him, wondering what he was up to.. I didn't even know why I trust this guy, I don't even know him that well..   "This is the place where I love to be at, whenever I'm sad or frustrated, it always helps me relax.." Louis explained briefly.  I laughed, "Do you want me to shout towards the sea?"  "No," He laughed too. "Well, that works too.. But I just want you to have fun.." He removed his shoes and rolled his trousers up.  I stared hard at him, "What are you doing?"  "Take off your shoes too.." He said and I followed, feeling foolish. He grabbed my wrist and dragged me over to the sea.  As we got closer and closer, a wave rushed up to right where our bare feet were. I squealed and jumped, feeling the coldness of the seawater. Louis laughed and tried to pull me closer, but I stood firm on the ground, pulling him back, "Stop pulling me!"  "Don't be scared, it's really fun." Louis said, grinning and his eyes twinkling mischievously.  Just then, another wave came in, and Louis pulled me into the shallow waters. I felt the water seep into my skirt and reach my skin, the sand beneath my feet were soft. Shivering slightly, I clutched onto Louis, "What are you trying to do?"   He let go of me and waggled his eyebrows, then, he splashed some water onto my face. The water hit my face, making me splutter. "Gross!! It's salty!!" I screamed, grinning widely and splashing some water onto his face too.  But he used his hands to block his face from my "attack".. So I continually splashed him with water, making his hair wet. He splashed me back too, I was even wetter.. All the while, we were laughing like mad and I was feeling light-hearted, having much fun..  Louis was so good at this "splashing game".. Then, I had an idea.. He was still splashing my face when I put a hand to my forehead, swaying slightly, and pretended to feel faint.  He stopped and bit his lip, "Selina! Are you okay?"  I quickly bent down and collected some seawater into my palms, splashing the water all over him. He was caught off guard, and he stood there limply, spluterring slightly.  "Gotcha! How's the taste of seawater?" I laughed hysterically and waded quickly towards the shore.  "Hey!! Revenge time!!" He yelled behind me and I heard splashing sounds. I knew that he was coming after me, causing me to wade faster.   After we reached shore, both of us collapsed on the sand, feeling extremely tired out. After a few minutes, we both glanced sideways at each other and both cracked up at the same time.   "This is stupid.." I said between giggles, "Anyway thanks so much for today, Louis. I really enjoyed myself."  He did not answer but grinned broadly at me. I grinned back at him. Then, I realised that his eyes were really very mesmerizing.. I was lost in the depths of his eyes for a few minutes, when I looked at him and he looked back at me.   I don't know what would happen if we continued that way forever, but I won't ever know, because I looked away, breaking that special connection.  Clearing my throat, I asked, "Aren't you going to ask me why I was crying that bad?"  He shook his head, "Why should I? Everyone has their bad times.."  "Yeah, I guess.." I replied awkwardly.  In the end, the two of us went back to Louis' cab, holding our shoes in our hands. My skirt was still wet at the bottom, and so were my feet, so I still did not want to wear them.  I had great fun today. I don't know why.. maybe it was because of the presence of Louis, or maybe course he does things that make me happy? I don't know.. but he really made me relax, and stop thinking so much about Ahdi...   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  If the sun sets, and a single tear drops from your eye, you're going to lose the whole sky of stars..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ "Care for a drink?" Shawn asked me causually after a few minutes of talk.   I lay down on the sand and considered for a few seconds. It did not actually matter, does it? It was just a drink, right? Moreover, this is a beach. My mouth is so dry.. "All right, then." I agreed.  Shawn smiled wanly at me and stood up, brushing the sand off his jeans. I did the same and followed him towards a cafe near the seashore. We sat down at a seat near the window that overlooked the scenery of the sea.  "What may you like to order?" A blonde waitress with an apron tied at her waist asked with a polite smile.  "A latte please, thank you." Shawn returned a smile while ordering.  "Make that two. Thanks." I smiled politely at the waitress too, who bowed her head slightly and walked away.  "So, how do you find this place?" Shawn asked me, gesturing to the interior decor of the cafe.  I looked around. Near the door, there was a counter, with a big blackboard with all the drinks and snacks written on it using chalk, behind the counter. A plump, obese, blonde woman was standing behind the counter, serving a customer. The whole place was painted in brownish red..  It gives you a homey kind of feeling, it was a really small place, considering it was a cafe. But, it was very cosy as well..  "Very cosy.." I commented and my gaze diverted back to Shawn. "Are you here just because of the photograph exhibition?"  "Well, I don't really know.. I guess I want to be in a new environment.. Moreover, my best friend is here too..." He responded thoughtfully.  New environment? What happened to him that he wanted to have a new environment? I wanted desperately to ask, but thought better of it. I knew for a fact, that prying into other people's business wasn't what they like..  But Shawn seems to know my mind. "You want to know why I needed a new environment?"  My face reddened, because he hit the nail on the head, and I nodded timidly.  "Well, I had this girlfriend.. Her name is Ruby.. And well, we've broken up already.. Turns out she was two-timing me, and in the end, she chose the other guy.." Shawn explained, not a single trace of sadness on his face.  I wondered inwardly how he could not feel sad at all.. But mostly, I sympatized with him, "I can't believe anyone who is so heartless, especially when you're so nice." Right after I said that, I realised I had said the wrong thing. Because after that sentence, followed an awkward pause.  "Well, I thought we were in love with each other.. But.. she proved me wrong.. I had never gave up on love and hope though, because I still believed that it exists.." Shawn smiled wryly.  I pondered at his last sentence. 'I had never gave up on love and hope though, because I still believed that it exists..' I did not know how to answer to that sentence, so I just sipped on my latte, which the waitress just brought.  After the quick drink, and a long hearty chat, we went up to the counter and Shawn gave a $10 bill to the obese woman. She gladly accepted it and gave Shawn the change.  "Erm," I said after exiting the cafe, "Let me pay you back.."  "It doesn't matter.. It's only a few dollars.." Shawn said re-assuringly.  "No, no. Just let me pay you back.." I insisted. I did not want him to get the wrong idea that if he paid for me, it was actually a date. No, it definitely wasn't.. It was just a friendly meet-up with a normal friend...  ________________________________________  +_[Selina's Point Of View]_+  I was weighing my choices..   Divorce Ahdi.. and get what consequenses?  Don't divorce him.. and get what?  "Urghhh!" I screamed out, feeling frustrated. No matter how much analysis I do, I still go back to square one.. It was not which consequenses will be bigger.. It was which will hurt more..  If I divorce him, I would feel broken and empty everyday without him.. And it would hurt me and my baby..  If I don't divorce him, We would both feel extremely hurt.. Because he needed to take up this responsibility, and I would feel selfish, because I made him stay back because I needed him.. But he no longer needed me.. And the baby would grow up in such a unloving family.  If I continued this marriage with him, we would just be deceiving everybody, deceiving ourselves.. It isn't worth it.. In the end, the person who will get hurt the most would be me...  But if i divorced him.. at least he would be happy.. at least he would not cheat on me, and save me from the countless times I'll be hurt.. If we weren't together, he would not feel responsible, he would be free.. He would have been happy.. And I want him to be happy..  But at the same time, I need him so much.. In fact, too much.. Can I.. would I.. be so noble as to give him up?  For him, I must, mustn't I?  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Like winter nights need fire, like temples need a shrines,like lovers need desire, like prophets need a sign, like children need their mothers, like rivers need the sea, like lovers need each others, like prisons need a key... i need you, can't you see, i need you...  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+ My lips curved into a small smile as I lay quietly on the pure, soft sand of the beach I first met Hebe, or should I say, first saw her back?  I was here partly because I missed her and partly because I had practically nothing to do. I had just been to a job interview. I wanted to work as a magazine's photographer.. It wasn't something that was very professional, but I needed to make a living.. I was to start work next week, and I wanted to take all the time I have to relax myself..  I still desperately wanted to know Hebe's past, i wanted to know what's making her so sad.. Sighing, I closed my eyes.  "Hey," I heard a female voice say and I opened my eyes, looking up to see someone standing next to me. I couldn't really make out her features because she was blocking the sunlight. But, i recognized her voice.  "Hey," I said back, sitting up and brushing the sand off my back. Then, I turned to face Hebe who was half-smiling at me.   "Can I call this fate or what? I don't know how many times we've met already.." Hebe sat down next to me and leaned back on her palms.  "I don't really know either.." I placed my hands on the sand and leaned back too, gazing at the beautiful sea and listening to the waves crashing against the shore.  "You do know that your prize-winning photograph had me, don't you?" Hebe said with a twisted smile, glancing sideways at me.  "Yes.." I grinned back, "I think I can call it fate that I saw you and took a picture of you, and then, I met you so many times.."  "Maybe.." She said absent-mindedly, staring out into space. Her eyes carried sadness, I had a feeling she did not even hear me.  "How's your friend in the hospital?" I changed the subject.  "Hmm.. she's alright, I guess.." Hebe replied, no longer distracted.   "I guess?" I repeated, looking at her questioningly.  "I found out what was bothering her.. I can't believe I did not see it.. Her husband turned out to be cheating on her.. And she caught him in the act.. Then, she found out that she was pregnant.. Now, her husband wants to get back with her, but only because of her baby, not because of love.. He does not love her anymore.." Hebe hugged her knees close to her chest and let out a dry sob.  I patted her on her shoulder lightly, feeling a little overwhelmed by touching her. "Don't worry. Your friend will be just fine.. Does she plan to divorce her husband?" I pitied with Hebe's friend and couldn't imagine her husband to be so heartless..  "I don't know.." Hebe bit her lip, "I'm a useless friend.."  "No, you're not. Your friend probably doesn't want you to worry about her.. You're not useless, no one is." I said comfortingly, feeling a big urge to hug Hebe.  Hebe offered me a genuine smile, "Thanks Shawn. I really needed that."  I smiled back, feeling my heart skip a few beats, "No problem. Advice your friend, tell her what she should do.. She needs your help right now.."  "Thanks again.." Hebe's smile grew wider.  ____________________________________________  +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  I didn't know why, I just could blurt everything out in front of Shawn.. I knew I could trust him.. And he gives me good advice too. I felt much better after talking to him..  I hoped what he said was right. But I knew Selina really needed some help now..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  A leaf that was blown off a tree can't be grown back onto it.

      On monday morning, Selina was discharged. She returned home in perfect health but a broken heart. She was now sitting a cab back home. Ahdi offered to give her a ride, but she decided against that. Her handphone in her bag rang. --Yuan Fang Ringtone--. Fishing it out, she answered the call, "Hello?"  "Hey Se! How're you feeling?" It was Hebe. She sounded cheerful.  "Hey. I'm alright now. How about you? You sounded particularly happy." Selina replied, fingering the ends of her hair.  "Work's killing me. Talking to you is my only pleasure." Hebe said simply, gaining a laugh from Selina, "So, how's my dearest friend and her little baby?"  Touching her belly gently, Selina smiled slightly although the thought of her baby saddens her. "Both are perfectly fine. Go back to your work. I'm reaching home in a few minutes."  "Okay, then." Hebe's voice carried uncertainty, but she hung up after a few words of farewell.  The cab stopped at a red-light. The driver turned around to face Selina. He was chinese and looked really handsome, with extremely tanned skin, broad muscular shoulders, and a bright dazzling smile that could melt any girl's heart. "Hey, you mind a quick talk? It could really bore you here."  "Nope. Not at all. I'm Selina." She replied, offering a little smile.   He turned back and glanced at Selina using the rearview mirror before moving the car again, "I'm Louis Koo. How do you doo?" He intentionally lenghtened the word "do" to make it rhyme with "koo", causing Selina's laughter to fill the whole cab.  "Yeah, that's the way. You should laugh more often, Selina. Your laughter is beautiful." He grinned at her reflection in the rearview mirror.  She smiled coyly, "Thanks. Anyway, what are you doing here in New Zeland? Very few chinese here.."  "Hmmm." He considered this, "I used to study the U in Australia.. But, after I finished studies, I wasn't interested in what I had studied, it was what my parents want me to study, not what I truly wanted.."  "So, you were interested in driving a taxi?" Selina asked, raising her eyebrows.  "No," Louis said, his eyes laughing mischievously, "I was interested in music.. I really really loved it.. but my demanding parents wanted me to study law. And I did, for my whole life, I had been doing what my parents wanted, so, now I wanna do what I want to do, not what they want me to do.."  Selina nodded, understanding, "I see.. That's good. You should do what you want to. Anyway, why are you in New Zealand? I thought you were in Australia?"  "Oh, well, I prefer it here.. It's quieter and less rowdy." Louis said simply while making a turn.  Selina nodded mutely again. "It is quieter here.. I moved here about one year ago, I think.. I moved here because of my- friend.." She had really wanted to refer to Hebe as her sister-in-law, but the marriage did not happen..  "Oh?" He lifted his eyebrow in curiousity, but did not inquire further. "What were you doing in the hospital?"  "Nothing big." Selina answered tonelessly, causing Louis to shut his mouth. "We're here, Miss Selina." He said as he stopped his cab in front of Selina's house.   "Thank you, Louis. It's been nice talking to you." Selina beamed politely at Louis and walked into the house after paying the fare.   +_[Selina's Point Of View]_+  Why does everything remind me of Ahdi? Why? Why doesn't he love me anymore? So many questions, and no answers..   I wanted to scream, to pour everything out, instead, I cried silently...  +_[Louis' Point Of View]_+  That Selina girl, she is kinda pretty, she leaves me with this tingling sensation in my heart..  But I could sense some sadness in her.. I really hoped I could make her laugh like today again..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Love is just like a butterfly; hold it too tight, it will get hurt, hold it too loose, it will fly away.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      Selina woke up with a sharp aching sensation in the pit of her stomach. She groaned as she sat up, leaning against the pillow for support. She looked around and found that she was alone. The only thing accompanying her were the four yellowish walls surrounding her and the loneliness in the air.  Closing her eyes, flashes of the scene she had witnessed that day portrayed in her mind. Tears were boiling in her eyes, she did not know if she could take it anymore. The question that had always filled her mind ever since she saw Ahdi with that girl popped up again.  +_[Selina's Point Of View]_+  "Why?" I mumbled inaudibly to myself. Why did he want to cheat on me? Am I not enough for him? Does he despise me? We've only been married for a year or so, nearing to our second anniversary. We've always wanted a baby, but never succeeded..  But, why? Now, at the most inappropriate time possible! I was never the forgiving type, not like Hebe. I couldn't easily forgive someone who had caused hurt to me, or any of my friends and family. Ahdi betrayed me. He utterly betrayed me, he had let me down, let down all my hopes and dreams about him.  But, if I don't forgive him just because he caused hurt to me, I would cause hurt to my unborn baby. It would be hurt all his life, wanting to know why other children have fathers while he or she doesn't.  I do not want to bring any harm or insult to my baby, I wanted to protect it with all I have.. With tears coursing down my cheeks, I decided that I could forgive Ahdi. For the baby, for us, for the family..  The door creaked open, making me snap open my eyes. Staring at the intruder of my thoughts, I hastily wiped the tears away from my face and looked directly at him, waiting for him to start a conversation.  He looked back at me. Somehow, he could adopt this way to keep his facial expression deadpan and I would not know what he is feeling. My heart thumped faster every second and my face was getting red hot under his gaze. Why does he still have that effect on me? And it was obvious, he did not feel the same way.  Inhaling deeply, I began, "What do you want?" I hadn't wanted it to come out that way. But it just did.  "I want.. I want.. you to forgive me.. for the baby.." He said, stuttering a bit.  My heart was crushed. He wanted to get back with me just because of the baby.. not because he had any special feelings for me.. "Ahdi, Why, in the first place, did you cheat on me?"  "I.." He did not know how to answer. My heart felt shattered just as easily as glass falling onto the ground. "Did you.. not.. l-love m-me anymore?" I blurted out softly, hoping that the answer was no.  His head hung, indicating his answer..  "You r-really d..do..don't lo-love me any.. more?" I choked out, tears clogging up my throat and brimming in my eyes.  "I'm sorry..." He responded. The tears I had been fighting to hold back burst out. I felt so much like throwing, kicking or punching something. My heart felt like a thousand knives piercing through it, making it hurt with a nameless ache. My heart was already so injured, I couldn't bear for it to hurt anymore..  ____________________________________  While Ahdi and Selina were having that conversation in Selina's ward, Hebe was outside the door, listening in on every detail.   +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  I felt my heart ache for Selina. I could not believe Ahdi would actually cheat on her!! What a jerk!! I've always thought of him as a kind, thoughtful and protective husband..  To think he would actually cheat on such a lovely wife like Selina? And he does not love her anymore.. He only wants to get back together with Selina because of the baby.. I felt my eyes misting over as I stared at Selina's wounded expression. I knew exactly how she was feeling..   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Knowing the truth and hearing the truth are two completely different things.   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ I leaned on the railing, staring out of the window sliently, watching the sun set beautifully. This apartment had a perfect view of the sunset, it was one of the reasons why Edison and I wanted to buy it. After Edison died, Selina had bought this apartment for me...  I really must stop being so deep in thoughts all the time, even Selina had noticed it. I had been thinking a lot about Shawn and how much fun we had. It made me realise I had not had fun in a long long time..  Turning back, I glanced at the clock on the wall. 6.05 pm. "Hmmm.. Where's Selina and Ahdi? They should be back a long time ago.." I wondered aloud.  Suddenly, the phone rang, breaking into my thoughts. I walked towards it and picked it up. "Hello?" I said into the receiver.  "Hello? Hebe?" Ahdi's voice came into earshot from the other end.  "Yes. Where are you and Selin-?" I was interrupted by Ahdi's panicked voice. "Selina's admitted to hospital. She fainted."  I was shocked. After getting the details, I rushed out of the house, flagging down any cab in sight. "Urghh!" I vented my frustrations on the ground. Every cab has a passenger! Combing fingers through my hair anxiously, I frantically thought of any other way to go to the hospital..  Just then, a black car stopped in front of me. I looked hard at it. The side window was rolled down and I saw Shawn leaning from the driver's seat to talk to me. "Need a ride?" He asked, offering a smile.  "Anxiously." I replied as I opened the door and climbed into the seat next to Shawn. Closing the door, I turned to face him, "Hospital please."  "Hospital?" He asked curiously while returning his gaze to the road.  "Step on it." I said blandly, reminding myself of what I told myself last night.   He nodded and obeyed. "What were you doing on that road?" I asked him despite myself.  "Nothing much. I'm meeting my friend somewhere near here.." He responded while smiling politely.  I didn't return the smile, "I'm sorry, having to take up your time."  "It doesn't matter..." He said, smile fading a little. For the rest of the journey, we did not talk till we reached the hospital. I was so frantic, I was out of my mind.   Immediately after Shawn stopped the car, I opened the door and dashed into the hospital. I looked around and saw a nurse station. "Miss," I said, running towards a long-haired nurse, "Do you know where Selina Ren Jia Xuan is admitted to?"  She gave me the ward number and I dashed all the way up to Selina's ward.   +_[Ahdi's Point Of View]_+  The doors slammed open and revealed Hebe, panting heavily, sweat trickling down her forehead. She walked hurriedly towards Selina and peered down at her, then she looked up at me, "How did this happen?"  "Er.." I did not know how to answer. I didn't know if I should tell Hebe about.. that.. But she will know sooner or later.. Just then, the doctor came in and saved me the chance to answer.  "You must be Selina Ren's family.." The doctor began. When no one interrupted, he continued, "Selina had fainted due to overstress.. meaning she is too tired.. Because our scans have showed that Miss Selina Ren is two months pregnant, she cannot tire herself too much.."  "Two months..?" Hebe looked shell-shocked at the doctor.  "Pregnant?" I choked out, finishing the sentence for Hebe.  The doctor nodded, "Take good care of the patient."  I was shocked, but was also elated. I'm going to be a father!! But then, will Selina forgive me? It was just a moment of folly.. I reasoned with myself.  Hebe smiled brightly after she got over her shock, "I'm going to be an aunt!" I looked guiltily at Selina's angelic sleeping face. Then, she stirred and her eyes slowly opened..  +_[Selina's Point Of View]_+  I opened my eyes slowly. At first, my vision was blurred. Blinking a few times, my vision cleared. The first person I saw was Ahdi.. Then, I saw Hebe smiling at me.. There was a slight ache in my head and a distaste in my mouth. What was happening to me?   "Hey Se. You've woken." Hebe said, pulling me gently up into a sitting position and lifting my pillow up for me to rest on. I didn't answer. I was looking at Ahdi..  He looked back at me with no expression on his face. I had no idea what he was feeling now. Guilt? Anger? I don't know.. But for me to witness such a scene, I really couldn't take it..  "Selina, you're.." Hebe interrupted herself, "I think I'll let Ahdi announce the good news." And she stepped away to let Ahdi take her place beside my bed.   He took my hand in his, I had an urge to pull away, but something tells me not to, "You're going to be a mother, Selina."  "M-Mother?" I spluttered, unable to believe my ears.  "The doctor said your pregnant!" Hebe said enthuisiastically.  "P-Pregnant?" I repeated, my mind a total blank.  I stared at Ahdi. I wasn't planning to forgive him for what he did.. But now, I have a baby.. This innocent unborn baby has to have a father..   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Love is forgiving and understanding.. There are no "I'm sorries" in Love.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ "Thud!!" That was the noise that sounded when I dropped the can of luncheon meat. I scrunched up my face in irritation and slowly bent down to pick the damn thing up. I couldn't be too quick, if not the rest of my groceries would fall out of my hands..  Today had been super super unlucky for me. Selina is still in the hospital resting, so I had to go to the supermarket to buy our weekly groceries.. That wasn't so bad.. I have got a list of everything I have got to buy..   But it was when the last basket where I can put my groceries, was snatched away by a middle-aged and unreasonable auntie, that was really unlucky for me. Now, I have to hold the groceries in my hands.. and I was constantly dropping stuff.. It was a good thing that I did not need to buy that many things..  After walking a few steps, I dropped my luncheon meat again. I saw the shoppers nearby giving me annoyed looks. I gave them a weak apologetic smile and picked it up again. Although I was smiling, on the inside, I was mentally complaining, "Do you think I want that? Blame it on the auntie who snatched away my basket..!!"  Struggling with the groceries, I walked up to the cashier and slowly let go of some groceries.. Finally, my hands were free.   After I paid the cashier and walked out of the supermarket to the carpark, I held the plastic bags in one hand and tried to find Selina's car keys in my pocket.  The keys fell onto the floor. I glared at the keys angrily. "Urghhh!!" I yelled in frustration. Just as I was about to bend and pick the keys up, I saw another hand pick them up.  I looked up to see Shawn smiling at me, handing me the keys.   +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+  I'm wondering.. why do I always meet Hebe? Is it like fate or something?   She took the keys from my hand and eyed me, "Why do I always meet you?" I wanted to laugh, we were wondering the exact same thing!  "I don't know.. Maybe because Te Anau is small?" I offered, afraid that she thought I was following her.  "Yeah. It's small, but not that small.." Hebe said, still a little suspiciously. Before I could answer, she continued, "Ah well, whatever. anyway, thanks for last time, when you gave me a ride."  "Welcome." I responded feeling happy that she remembered my giving her a lift, putting my hands into the pockets of my jeans. "Anyway, who were you visiting?"  "A friend of mine fainted and was admitted to the hospital." She said simply, implying she did not want to reveal much. But she did seem more cheerful than she was when I gave her a lift.  "Oh.. Is your friend okay now?" I asked in concern.  "She is pregnant. And she is physically okay. But I don't know about mentally.." She said, her eyebrows knitted tightly into one, shifting the plastic bags from her left hand to the other.  "What do you mean?" I inquired curiously.  "Well, she has always liked children.. and she would have been excited when she has one. But, when the news was announced.. she did not seem too happy. She was surprised, yes.. But happy, I can't say.." She said thoughtfully, bringing a finger to her chin.   "Oh.. Maybe she has some problems? You should talk to her.." I advised.  Then, she straightened up as if something hit her in the back. "I gotta go.." And walked away from me before I could say anything.  "Bye!!" I shouted to her retreating back view. She seemed like she thought she had talked too much.. I thought. But I really wanted to know more about her, I wanted to know everything about her.. Why didn't she want to talk to me?  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  A simple "Thank You" or a genuine smile from the one you love would leave you feeling overjoyed.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Selina's Point Of View]_+ "Owwww!!!!" Hebe yelled as she jumped up from the chair like a cat. I rolled my eyes at her, still holding on to her leg.  "Sit." I commanded, "You're going to hurt it even more if you move about.." I rubbed the medication oil onto Hebe's sprained ankle. "See, your ankle so badly sprained already."  Hebe grimaced in pain, "Can rub it gentler? My foot is not exactly metal you know."  I giggled at her and poked playfully at her foot, "Yeah. It's wood."  Hebe withdrew her leg away from me and stuck her tongue out at me. "You seem to be in a good mood." I commented causually.  Hebe had this unreadable expression on her face and replied, "I'm okay. Anyway, thanks. I feel better already."  I lifted an eyebrow,"That's physcological. It's supposed to take some time to work." I gestured towards the medicated oil.  "Whatever." Hebe said and got off the chair, putting her weight carefully onto her injured foot. "Ouch. You're right. It still hurts." She sighed and plopped down on the chair.  I sat down on the chair next to her," How was the exhibition last night?"  "It was all right." She answered and had this unreadable expression on her face again. "What's with you today?" I asked her, waving a hand in front of her eyes.  She caught my hand and pressed it into my lap," Nothing."  "So, who sent you home yesterday? You couldn't have got home with that ankle of yours. And hailing a cab at that place is almost impossible." I asked Hebe, making casual talk.  There was that unreadable expression on her face again!! I was getting sick of that, "Never mind. I'm going to meet Ahdi now." I interrupted her speech before I could make out the first word. I washed the medicated oil off my hands and grabbed my handbag, "See you."  "You're half an hour early." Hebe glanced at her watch before looking back at me.  "I wanna surprise him." I beamed happily at her.  "Bye." Hebe called out to me as I was heading towards the door.  ____________________________________  I dashed towards the carpark. I vaguely saw Ahdi's car parked right beside the wall. Running so that I could surprise Ahdi, I took out my mobile phone. Ahdi is very particular about puncuality, so if I'm early, he would be really happy.  I turned the corner, and what I saw made me nearly drop my mobile phone. I froze on the spot, staring at the scene that I had just witnessed. Ahdi's back was facing me, and his body was pressed close to another girl's. He was kissing her passionately with his hands up her skirt. The girl was wearing very skimpy clothes and was moaning softly as her eyes were shut tightly.  "Ahdi.." I whispered softly, tears slowly forming in my eyes.  I saw him pull quickly away from the girl and look back at me in shock. He pulled his hand away from the girl and moved away from her. She looked bug-eyed at me.  "Hsiao Jing Hong!" I glared furiously at him, stuggling to fight my tears back. Ahdi knew that I was really angry. Because I had seldom used his full chinese name. The last time was because he had nonchantly insulted my brother but he was only joking.  There was a perfect reason why I should be angry. I can't believe Ahdi had actually did this to me!! Tears spilled out of my eyes unexpectedly, I couldn't hold them back after all.   "Selina, don't cry. I'm sorry.." Ahdi said, walking towards me. Wrong move. I delivered a tight slap to the side of his face with all the strength I could muster.  Ahdi's head snapped to the side. I stared at him, wiping the tears away from my cheeks, "Don't-"  Suddenly, I felt my head spin, my stomach ached. I felt to the ground with a thud as darkness hit me.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  The most cruel thing in the world a guy could do to a girl is making her fall for him and not intending to catch her.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ The exhibition was running smoothly. I came out to take a breather. Walking slowly along the pavement, I thought about Edison... I sighed, I really must move on, I must let go and stop thinking that Edison is still alive, because he's not..  "Ahh.." I cried as I was about to fall. I stuck my hands out to prevent my fall. My hands hit the cold hard floor and I felt my skin tear. I looked at my feet to see what caused my fall and saw that my heel on my right foot had broke.   "Ouch," I cringed in pain as I massaged my sprained ankle. I stood up with much difficulty and took off both my shoes. It was pointless to leave my other shoe on. Staggering with a sprained ankle, I lost my balance and was about to fall when, I felt a strong arm heave me up.  I looked behind my shoulder and saw Shawn looking back at me. "Broke a heel?" He asked, looking at the high-heels in my hands.  "Yes, "I said, moving away from him, "Thanks for er.. catching me.." I thanked him awkwardly.  "You sprained your ankle, Miss Tian?" He watched me limp away from him before following.  "Er, yes." I said without looking at him.  "You're still going back to the exhibition? You sprained your ankle badly! It's going to get worse if you insist on working." He chided me gently.  "Yes, I'm going back. I have to make sure everything is in right order, Mr Yue." I gritted my teeth and replied dryly.  "Don't. Ella can do that. You have to go home, the exhibition is in good hands." Shawn insisted.  I turned to face him and glared at him, "Which part of 'Yes. I'm going back' do you not understand?" And continued limping towards the exhibition hall. I heard him walk after me so I limped faster, causing the pain in my ankle to worsen.  "Ouch!" I gasped as I fell onto the floor.   "Miss Tian, are you all right?" Shawn came rushing up next to me and examined my feet. "There's a cut on your sole. And your sprain is getting worse. C'mon, I'll bring you home." He held onto my arm and helped me up.  "There's no need. I'll go home myself. Thanks for the offer." I freed myself from his grip.   "Your feet are so badly wounded! How can you get home yourself?" Shawn asked.  I did not answer, but continue limping painfully away from him. Just then, he blocked my way and said, "Let me carry you." I stared balnkly at him, "Carry me? Stop joking. No way."  He didn't answer but bent down a little and offered his back to me. I stared at his back, "I..I.. don't.. want.."  "C'mon. My legs are getting numb." He said jokingly, looking back at me. "I really don't want to.." I hesitated.  "Just come on!!" He gestured towards his back, "My legs are really going to break if you don't hurry up."  I climbed gingerly onto his back and he straightened up. "Gosh, you sure are heavy, Miss Tian."  I hit him gently on his back, "Then, you still carry me? Call me Hebe, anyway."  "Okay. Call me Shawn too. Where do you live?" this way, we started a lively conversation. Throughout the walk back to my house, we chatted and joked. Well, he joked mostly and I laughed at his lame jokes.   When I reached home, I thanked him for sending me home and walked in before further talk. As soon as I closed the door, I leaned on it wearily. Tonight had been really fun. But it was wrong, I shouldn't have been having fun, I shouldn't have been laughing.. It's wrong. I insisted.  "I mustn't laugh or be happy. Without Edison here, I shouldn't be happy. He would be so disappointed with me.." I said anxiously and told myself not to enjoy myself again.  _______________________________________  +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+  Seconds after Hebe closed the door, I hailed a cab and went back to my rented apartment. I had really enjoyed myself with her today.. I wondered why I had offered to carry her on my back.. I was feeling very happy when she accepted the offer.  I knew that she had fun too.. I was feeling overjoyed by the time I reached my apartment. I smiled in joy, wondering what was happening to me. Is this love? I think I'm falling in love with Hebe...  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Love is everything it's cracked up to be.. that's why people are so cynical about it. It's worth fighting for, being brave for and risking everything for. The trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ I went back to the office today. I was in there really early, to pay back the time i had lost while I was on leave yesterday. That was my excuse, but the real reason is trying to forget Edison..  They all say time heals.. I never thought it does. Time doesn't heal, it numbs. It doesn't make the pain go away, it just makes the pain more bearable.. I thought miserably as I started typing the proposal I owed my boss. My mind wandered elsewhere.. I snapped back to reality. "Think straight, Hebe!!" I scolded myself.  I stared at the computer screen. I had just typed "Edison" into the proposal. Clearing the words away, I leaned on my high-backed office chair and buried my face into my palms. I just couldn't get Edison out of my mind. Nothing is working!!   "Miss Tian?" I heard a knock on the door, "Is something troubling you?"  I looked up to see Ella beaming down at me. I smiled weakly back at her, "Er, nothing. I'm just tired." I came up with an excuse. It was a good one. Because in case there were tears in my eyes.  "You still sick?" Ella asked me in concern.  "Oh, no.. Just a little bit tired. What is it, anyway?" I waved a hand nonchantly and changed the subject.  "Um, these are the prize-winning photographs and they are waiting for you to pin them up onto the exhibition board. The rest had already been pinned." Ella replied in a business-like tone, "Oh yes, and Mr Shawn Yue looked for you."  "Mr Shawn Yue?" I repeated, trying to remember if i had heard that name before, "What did he want?"  "I'm not sure. He said he had something to discuss with you.." Ella shrugged and handed the photographs over to me. I nodded and Ella went out of my office. I examined the photographs. Then, I saw the photograph, "Alone In The Sand".   "He got second?" I asked myself, almost laughing at the thought that any photograph with me in it would win second in a competition.   _______________________________________  +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+  "There she is!!" I whispered enthuisiastically to myself, looking at Miss Tian's back. She was busy instructing the workers to pin up the przie-winning photographs.  I walked up to her, feeling my heartbeat increase for no particular reason. "Hi Miss Tian." I greeted her.  "Hi," She said, looking at me, "Heard you won second. Congratulations."  "Thank you.." I replied, "You were on sick leave yesterday?"  "You're Mr Shawn Yue?" She asked, a surprised expression on her face, "What do you wanna discuss with me?"  "Uh," I hesitated, doing some quick thinking, "Nothing much really. I had it solved already."  "Oh. Okay then." Miss Tian answered, not caring and returned to instructing the workers. I felt a little dejected but knew that I would see her again at the exhibition tonight..  ____________________AT THE EXHIBITION____________________  "It's a great photo, Shawn. Though I don't really understand the girl.. and the beach.." My best friend, Louis Koo stood in front of my photograph and commented.  I laughed merrily, "Louis.. You can't convince me with that tone.. 'It's a great photo'.. right.." I said good-naturedly. Louis laughed along with me.  From the corner of my eye, I saw Miss Tian leave the exhibition hall. "Louis, "I said hurriedly, "I needa go do something urgent. Bye."   I left Louis with a puzzled expression and followed Miss Tian.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Time doesn't heal. It numbs.

      Chapter 6  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ The only feeling of real loss is when you love someone,  more than you love yourself...  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  At that moment, Hebe felt that she had never cried so hard in these two years. After Edison died, she had been absorbing herself up in work, knowing that work would bury up her soul, leaving her no time to think about Edison.  But she had lived like before she met Edison.. an empty shell.. But she decided to trust people more, giving others as well as herself a chance. Selina was her best friend ever since then, encouraging her and giving her support. Hebe was really grateful to her, if not for her, she would have turned to suicide.   Suicide. To her, it was the only way out. The only way she could see Edison again. She knew that it was foolish to think that way, but she couldn't help herself. Moreover, how can she live on without Edison? She had tried them many times, but Selina had always succeeded in persuading her not to..  "Edison wouldn't have wanted you to die for him.. He would have wanted you to live on happily.. He would have wanted you to forget him and move on... Please do that, for him, for yourself." She had said when Hebe had a penknife held shaikly at her wrist. Hebe listened to her.  But she did not move on. She never had. Edison had taken a big part of her away.. To her, being happy without Edison was a crime, a sin, something that she would never do.. So, everyday she would go on without any finer feelings of life... A smile that she has would be only on her face, she had never smiled from her heart after that day...  ________________________________________________  +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+  I was in the photograph exhibition now. Miss Tian's assistant had told me that I had won 2nd in the competition. I was very proud of myself. Even though, I didn't win first, I was proud just to win a prize. It was not the prize I was after, but the confirmation that my works are good...  I scanned around the exhibition hall. No sign of Miss Tian.. Then, I caught sight of her assistant, Ella Chen. Rushing up to her, I asked politely, "Miss Chen? Do you know where Miss Tian is?"  "Oh. She is on sick leave today." She chirped politely back.  "Oh.. I see.." I said, disappointed.  "She must be terribly sick or something. She never takes a sick leave, she is really responsible." Ella continued, peering at me curiously, "Why are you so concerned?"  "Er.. nothing. I just wanna discuss something with her." I lied through my teeth, feeling a blush creep up my neck.  "Oh, don't worry. She would be here on the actual day the exhibition opens. As I said, she's a very responsible person. So, if there's nothing else, I shall leave?" Ella asked sedately.  "Oh, sure, sure. Thanks, Miss Chen." I smiled at her.  "Welcome. And call me Ella." She returned a smile and walked away.  "Hmmm.. She's sick? I hope she's alright.." I muttered under my breath.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Often, we say goodbye to the ones we love without wanting to, though that doesn't mean we've stopped loving them, or we've stopped to care. Sometimes, goodbye is a painful way to say I love you.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ Thinking about that fateful day, I pulled opened my drawer and took out my and Edison's wedding photos. We were both smiling very radiantly. My eyes were hanging with tears by the time I got to the last one, which was taken at where we first met, the beach.  My fingers trailed Edison's face softly. I wanted to feel his face again.. but all I felt was the cold, dry material of the photograph. "Edison.." I muttered inaudibly.  --FLASHBACK THREE__  I slipped into my engagement dress and felt the smooth fabric of silk brush past my skin softly. I rushed out of the house and Selina drove me to the ROM. Selina was Edison's sister. And we hit it off right away..  I was extremely nervous. My heart was thumping hard against my chest and my hands were sweating profusely in the white gloves that went with the dress.   Selina glanced sideways at me from the driver seat and grinned, "Nervous?"  "Yes.." I said, deadpan.   "Don't be. It's not even the actual day yet. When I was married to Ahdi, I was really nervous too.. But at that moment when the Priest asked me, 'would you take him as your husband?'.. I said yes.. and I know I made the right choice." She responded, all the while, her eyes were on the road.  When we finally reached the ROM, Selina turned towards the backseat and reached for the bouquet. She handed it to me and hugged me, "Good luck, Hebe." I took the roses and nodded, smiling. I felt better after Selina's assurance.  We were 15 minutes early. I straightened my gown nervously and walked up the steps to the ROM unsteadily. Luckily, Selina was there to help me. She was really a good friend. Without her, I would be dead nervous now.  Ahdi, my father and his parents were there already. I could see from the look on my father's face that he was not happy to be here. He wanted me to marry his business partner's son, who was egiostic and thought every woman would fall at his feet. Unfortunately, I didn't.  Despite my father's objections, I went ahead with the wedding, threatening to break ties with him. I was his only family, so obviously he did not want that.  "Where is he? He's late!" My father hissed into my ear angrily. He did not like his daughter marrying a pauper. A late pauper, too.   I glared at him, "He's not late! we're early."  "If everyone is already here, then, he is late." He insisted, glaring back at me.  I ignored him and looked away. The truth is, I was scared. And nervous. But more of scared.. Where is Edison? I wondered. He will be here. I assured myself. It's just the traffic.  Despite all the self-assurance, I couldn't ignore the unsettling feeling in me heart. We waited for 20 mintues.. Where is Ed? I was really anxious now.  Selina was calling Edison's mobile phone with hers. "Voicemail." She stated simply after hanging up.  I clasped my hands together tightly, praying that nothing bad happened to Edison. He wouldn't forget today. No, I know that he wouldn't... Just as I was imagining the worst, Edison's best friend, Nicholas Tze, rushed up to us.  His expression was anxious and a little sad. I questioned him, "Do you know where Edison is?"  "The hospital called. Edison had an accident and was sent to XXX hospital." He said, finally catching his breath.   I stared at him, dropping the bouquet in shock. The unsettling feeling was confirmed. Without speaking, I picked up my gown and ran. My mind was a blank, but my legs carried me to Selina's car.   I looked back to see Selina and Ahdi catching up with me. "Ahdi will fetch us there." Selina said, she looked really worried for her brother.   The ride to the hospital was silent. No one dared to say anything. Once we reached the hospital, I flung the door open and rushed out, not caring about the glances I earned because I was dressed in a wedding gown.  --FLASHBACK FOUR__  It has been officially one hour since Edison was in the opration room. Edison's parents, Selina, Ahdi, Nicholas and I were seated outside the operation room. My head was rested on my knees. My eyes were closed, but I was wide awake and felt no desire to sleep. I lifted my head and scanned around.  Edison's mother was resting on her husband's shoulder, sleeping while her husband was dozing off. Selina was leaning on the chair wearily, her fingers interlocked and placed on her lap next to Ahdi's hand. Ahdi had one hand on Selina's lap and one hand around her shoulder. He looked as worried as Selina. Nicholas was sitting beside me, staring blankly at his shoes.  I let my head drop again. I was praying hard that nothing would happen to Edison. He was my life, my soul, my everything. He can't leave me.   Finally, the lights were off and the door opened. Everyone stood up, crowding around the doctor who had just came out of the operation room.  "We did our best.. I'm sorry. Mr Chen died due to loss of blood." He said, his eyes filled with sympathy.  Edison d-died? I sank to my knees. Edison left me.. You said you would love me forever, Edison.. why didn't you keep your promise?!?! I felt like screaming. The world had just crashed down on me. God, why did you take Edison away from me? My heart was pierced by a thousand knives and it was bleeding fiercely.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  A million words wouldn't bring you back. I know, cos I tried. Neither would a million tears, I know, cos I cried.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ I stared blankly at the ground, hugging my knees to my chest. I was once again thinking about Edison.. and that incident.. that happened when I was only 9 years old.  When I was 9, my neighbour was very kind to me. He was in his fifties. He told me that he would protect me.. he would be there for me.. My parents were rich people, and they were never at home. So I trusted the old neighbour.. One day, he asked me to go over to his house..  And I remembered that once I was in his house, he ripped off my clothes and then, his and he raped me...  Even though I was very young then, I knew that it was wrong. Very wrong... From then on, I didn't believe in him, I locked myself up in my room, crying my heart out. And I didn't dare to tell my parents.. I was so scared.. that.. they would be ashamed of me..  So from then on, I would never trust anyone again. I build walls around my heart and they blocked anyone from trying to come in. Those people that were kind to me, I would always think if they have an ulterior motive for everything.  I even grown to despise my parents.. and grown apart from them.. Everything they did for me, underneath the surface, they are plotting some evil plan against me.. I would think that way. I had no friends, I don't trust any of them.. So, from then on, I lived.. like an empty shell..  Until.. that day I met Edison.. Vivid images replayed in my mind..  --FLASHBACK ONE__  I was walking on that beach I loved so much. Then, I saw a man, he was painting. Quietly, I crept behind him and took a peek at the painting. I drew in a breath sharply. It was truly beautiful.. the scenery of the beach..  He must have heard me gasp, because he turned around and looked at me curiously. He was really handsome, I realised. My face turned beet red and I turned away, ready to flee when I felt a hand pulling me back.   I turned back and saw him flashing a killer smile at me. He was still holding on to my hand when he asked me, "Would you like to watch me paint?" His voice was gentle. I would kill to stay beside him. But I nodded mutely, trying to hold back my excitement.  So I stayed beside him while he finished up his painting. All the while, I was watching him concentrating silently on his painting. I was deeply attracted by his looks and the way he paints. He was really talented.  When he was done, I relutantly turned to leave but he held me back. "Stay, please." He pleaded. I agreed, feeling my heart beat quicker every minute. "What's your name?" He asked me while we sat down on the sand.   "Hebe." I said, my voice barely a whisper.   He grinned, "I'm Edison."  I grinned back. And we chatted heartily like old friends catching up. Soon, I got very comfortable with him and felt that I could tell him everything. I opened my heart up to him and told him that incident. He was sympathetic, but not pitiful. He told me to be strong and said that not everyone is bad. And you gotta trust them to know. But do not trust them too much, in case they just want to hurt you. I believed him, and I was much happier that way.  And we slowly fell for each other.. Slow.. But hard..  --FLASHBACK TWO__  After I was done with my work, I went out of the office hurriedly to meet up with Edison. We were together for two years and he became my soulmate. I scanned around and saw his car parked near me. I went up to it and realised that the boot was open.   Before I could go around the car to investigate, I saw two big bouquets of pink roses at the backseat of the car. Puzzled, I looked at the boot. There, lay two bouquets of pink roses too. I was really confused. To why Edison would leave his car unattended and to why he had four bouquets of my favourite flowers in his car. I walked around to the driver seat.  I saw a box that unmistakebly looked like it contained a ring. I opened the door with my heart hammering. Picking up the box, I opened it. To my surprise, there was nothing inside. "Hebe!" I turned towards the voice and saw Edison running towards me with a sly grin on his face.  I looked at him in confusion. "These are for you.." Edison said, gesturing the roses and the box. I wanted to blurt out, "Where's the ring?" Instead, I slowly nodded my head, not too trusting my voice.  Then he kneeled down on my knee, "How can you have the ring if I haven't proposed?", holding a ring in one hand and taking my hand in the other. I was caught off guard.   "Will you marry me, Hebe?" He asked, kissing my hand gently. Too touched to speak, I nodded my head vigorously. Edison's face lit up and he slid the ring onto my fourth finger. It fit perfectly. He hugged me tightly, "I love you, Hebe."  "I love you too.." I choked out softly, hugging him back.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Love, an emotion so strong, that you would give up everything, to just feel it once, to know that you are part of something special, to know that you can feel can love really is ; to know, to feel, to love..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      "Hmmm. Everything's working out fine.." Hebe mumbled as she scanned around, looking at the workers decorating the place where the exhibition was held. There were a few workers crowding around the board and another worker climbing up a ladder.  Sighing, Hebe slumped down on a chair. Her head throbbed. She had been working on the exhibition without a rest, and her tired mind told her that she really needed one now.   "And I still have to come here tomorrow.. to put up the photographs.." Hebe almost groaned but she knew that this was her work. Normally, she would have enjoyed work.. She knew that after she lost Edison, she had engulfed herself in work and nothing else.  But, nowadays, She felt so tired and bored.. like nothing interests her anymore. "Wonder what's wrong with me?" Hebe thought. Just then, a young man entered the room.  +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  "Edison?!?!" I stared at the guy who just entered. But he did not look at me, he was busy looking around. I gulped, taking a closer look. I knew I must have looked like at idiot, gawking at that guy.  My gaze returned to the floor. No, It wasn't Edison. Taking a second look, he did not look that much like Edison, I must be seeing things.. I thought sadly.  I miss Edison so much..   Then, a voice interrupted my thoughts. "Um, Miss?"  I looked up and saw that guy whom I mistaken for Edison. No, definitely not Edison... "Miss?" He said again. "Oh.. Um, yes?" I asked.  "I'm a photographer.. And, um, I heard from a worker that you're the organizer?" He asked, flashing me a handsome smile.   I smiled back and stood up, despite my brain protesting. "Hi. I'm Hebe Tian,the mangaer of the organizing company. And I'm representing the company." I stuck out a hand for him to shake. He took it and I felt a little tingly when his skin touched mine.   "Must be the headache.." I thought.  +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+  I had a unique feeling when I shook her hand. I had never had this feeling before.. Not even when I was with Ruby.. She had a warm but tired smile on her face. She has pretty features and I felt that I have met her somewhere before.. But I just can't figure where..  "Are you going to submit your photo for the competition?" Hebe asked, letting go of my hand.  "Yes.." I answered as I fished out the photograph of the girl on the beach and handed it over to Hebe.  Hebe examined the picture, with her eyebrows raised.  "What?" I asked, looking at the picture over her shoulder.  She looked back at me, "Er.. nothing.. It's a beautiful picture. But who's that girl?" She pointed at the girl.  I shrugged, "I dunno.."  "Okay.." She said slowly, "What's the name?" She changed the subject.  "Alone In The Sand." I grinned. I had a hard time coming up with a name.. And I finally got a perfect one. I could sense that the girl was lonely. I don't know why, but somehow, I just could..   +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  Alone In The Sand? I stared hard at the photographer. Usually, I wouldn't care what the picture is called.. But, in this case, when the girl is me.. But how did he know I was lonely? I asked myself as sadness engulfed me again. It fit this picture so much..   At first I was so shocked that he got a picture of me on that beach.. Now, the name...  "Miss Tian?" The photographer peered into my face, "Are you okay?" I snapped back to reality.   "Um.. Yeah..yeah.." I said as I noted the title down and kept the photograph in my file. "I gotta go.. Bye." I walked away before he could say anything.  +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+  I stared transfixedly at Hebe's back. It was really very familiar.. Then it hit me. That girl in my photograph! It was her! That's why she had looked at me so weirdly when I showed her the photo...   And when I told her the name, her eyes seem to carry misery.. Maybe the name I chose for the picture was really perfect.. But what could be saddening her so much? I had this sudden urge to know everything about her...   But she had already walked out of the room.. maybe I'll see her at the exhibition?   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Wanting to understand someone and wanting to know someone is two completely different things  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      "Hebe!" Selina hollered at the sleeping Hebe, "Wake up.." "What?" Hebe asked, her voice coming out barely a whisper. She placed the pillow over her head.  Selina sighed and looked at her face, "You've been crying again, Hebe. I know.. You're usually the person who wakes me up.. not the other way round.. You have been crying to midnight again, right?" Selina's voice turned more gentle.  Selina heard Hebe sigh from underneath the pillow. She frowned and pulled the pillow away from Hebe, her eyes were shut tightly and she cupped her hands over her ears.  Selina pulled Hebe into a sitting position, "Hebe.."  "Okay okay.." Hebe opened her eyes slowly and stared at Selina.  "Hebe, you can't hide anything from me.." Selina sighed, "Please Hebe, don't cry over him already.. It's been over for so long.. You still can't forget him?"  "No.. I cant forget him..No matter how hard I try, I just can't.." Hebe said in a defeated tone.  Selina was speechless for a moment, then she changed the subject, "Quick.. Change your clothes.. If not you're going to be late.."  Hebe nodded and obeyed while Selina got out of the room. Once Selina got out, Hebe sighed wearily. Selina had been right, she had been crying to midnight.. Hebe quickly cleared her depressing thoughts away and dressed up for work.  +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  After that not so delicious breakfast Selina prepared for me, she drove me to work. I worked in this organizing company and my company offered me a post as a manager in the New Zealand branch. So, that's why I'm here.  As soon as I reached the office, I went straight to work. It sure was a hectic day today. Hearing a knock on the door, I looked up to see my secretary, Ella at the door. "Come in," I said and she opened the door, carrying a few files in her hands.  "Miss Tian, these are the files that need your signature.." Ella said as she placed the files onto my desk. I opened one of them and scanned through the details. 'We are happy to work with your company.. and hope that your company will do a good job.. please sign below.. blah blah..'  I resisted rolling my eyes and signed it. My life is getting boring, I thought. But this is the life I want, so who can I blame, but myself? I signed all the documents and passed them back to Ella. "Anything else?" I asked.  "Um, yah. There is an photograph exhibition next week. And Miss Tian, they requested you go and check on the workers so that they do a good job." Ella answered tonelessly.   "Oh.. Okay. I'll be there.." I peered into Ella's face, "You feeling okay? Why not I give you a day off?"  Ella's face brightened, "Really, Miss Tian? Thank you very much. I'm really not feeling very well.."  I nodded absent-mindedly and waved for Ella to go. After she went, I leaned back on my high-backed chair and sighed. This is the life I want, I reminded myself again.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  What you want in life, is often what you have always needed.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+ Lying on my stomach, I placed the photos on the bed. I picked up one of the sunrise and sighed. It was a perfect picture of the sun's rays peeking out of the horizon. Ruby had loved this picture. She thought it was one of my best works..  But i thought otherwise.. maybe it was because I am a professional photographer and when I look at photos, I see beneath the surface.. I understand and I see feelings of the picture. I don't see the beauty of a picture..  Now that Ruby was gone, all the photos I had taken was crap.I hoped that I can find inspiration in New Zealand, where I am flying to today. I'm going to New Zealand to take part in the photograph exhibition.  I wasn't confident I would get first, but I knew that before I can succeed, I got to try..  Throwing the picture of the sunrise together with all the pictures Ruby and I took together into the bin, I took my lugggage and headed to the airport.  ____________________________________________  Adjusting the camera on the tripod stand, I closed my left eye and looked into the camera. I saw the wonderful beach of Te Anau (some place in New Zealand). The waves crashing onto the shore was simply pleasing to my ears. Then, a figure entered my vision.   Even though the figure was a few metres away from me, I could see that it was a girl with long layered hair dyed gold at the bottom. She was slim and tall, wearing a loose dress that was swaying to the wind.  I could feel my heart hammering fast, this scene.. it was perfect!! I quickly adjusted the camera again and took the picture. Taking my eyes away from the camera, I stared at the girl. She was slowly walking away from me.   That back.. I would always recognize that back.. I thought. It was weird, I seem attracted to a stranger girl's back. Why is she walking alone in the sand? I asked myself and seem to sense that the girl was lonely..  Reluctantly, I tore my eyes away from her, removed my camera from the tripod and kept the tripod and camera into their respective casings.  Giving the girl a last fleeting glance, I walked away from the beach and towards my rented house.  ________________________________________  _+[Hebe's Point Of View]+_  Walking along the shore of the Te Anau beach in New Zealand, I felt a tear trickle down my cheek. It must have been the thousandth time I've cried..  Over Edison, over that incident that happened so many years ago that I wanted to forget but had never succeeded, over that missing part of myself that I found but lost again..  I have asked.. often enough..Why? Why is God so cruel to me? I looked skyward.. But God had never given me an answer. I prayed and prayed for a miracle..   I had given up hope.. miracles don't exist..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  It's not enough to have a dream, Unless you're willing to pursue it. It's not enough to know what's right, Unless you're strong enough to do it. It's not enough to learn the truth, Unless you also learn to live it. It's not enough to reach for love, Unless you care enough to give it Men who are resolved to find a way for themselves will always find opportunities enough; and if they do not find them, they will make them.   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+ It has been a few years.. And Hebe and my story lives on.. We sat together on a bench at the beach, looking out on the sea.  A little boy ran to us. "Hey Joshua!" Hebe hugged the 4 year old little boy as he climbed onto her lap.  "Joshua! Don't run so fast!" Selina shouted. "Mummy mummy!" Joshua grinned as he watched her mother running towards him. "You cheeky little brat.. Why are you running so fast for?" Selina  He stuck his tongue out, teasing his mother..  Selina and Joshua, her kid have been living great lives. They loved each other a lot.. Selina don't need her ex-husband anymore. As for Louis, he went to study Music back in HongKong. We all miss him, especially Selina..  But he needed to pursue his dreams. They are not together yet.. But maybe they will be.. in the future..  Takeshi and Mr Okaedo.. They, went back to Japan, of course. Takeshi persuaded his father against Hebe and his marriage. I should really thank him sometime.. As for Hebe's father, he didn't seem to realise his daughter's happiness is the most important..  But it doesn't matter. As long as I realise it..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  They say, nothing lasts forever.. It's true.. But forever doesn't matter, as long as I have you here by my side. The time is not important but what we have been through to achieve this love..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ I pushed Takeshi away and took a step back hastily. "Wha-?" I tried to ask but to no avail, due to over-shock, if there is such a thing.  "I-I-I..I'm sorry.." He stuttered, eyes darting towards the floor and staying there. I didn't know what he was feeling or thinking.. And I didn't care either.. But I needed to know what was going on, even though he was my future husband.. I saddened at the thought.  "Why-Why did you do that?" I asked, recovering a bit from the shock and awkwardness.  "I.. I'm really sorry.. I was too rash.. I know you were forced into this marriage.." He responded, shifting his foot from one to the other.  "What?" I stared at him in shock, wide-eyed. I don't understand this...  "I.. I.. liked you from first sight." He admitted.  "Ohmygod." I muttered inaudibly to myself. What have I gotten myself into?  "But don't worry I won't force you into the marriage.. not like our fathers.. I know the person you like is someone else.. I'm not sure who, but I know how it hurts not to be with the person you love.. I won't force you.. I'll help you instead.. if I'm able to.." He said all this in one breath.  "H-Help me? How?" I frowned, flabbergasted at his words.  "Help you get my father and your father to Japan, and help you stay here without them knowing for the time being.." He replied. But that didn't help in making me less confused.  Seeing the confused look on my face, he added, "Never mind. Just do whatever I say and I'll be able to help you stay in New Zealand.. Let's go back."   I nodded mutely. Somehow, I knew that I could trust Takeshi.. Maybe I could really escape this marriage! A bubble of excitement rose in my chest.  _____________________________________________  +_[Louis' Point Of View]_+  Shawn and I were sitting in Selina's ward after Hebe left. I was watching Se sleeping peacefully on the bed, her stomach now flat now that she has given birth to her baby..   I looked towards Shawn and found him staring into space, no doubt thinking about Hebe again. He had told me what happened in between the both of them. I felt that they were really a perfect couple.. But, fate.. I sighed.  "What?" Shawn looked at me, finally snapping out of his.. thoughts.  "Nothing. Just thinking." I replied.  He looked weirdly at me, "I was thinking too. Thinking that I should go back to HongKong."  "Go back??" I repeated, raising my voice a little, "Why??"  "I have been here long enough.. Too long, in fact." Shawn answered. I could see this sadness in his eyes. Must be because of Hebe again..  "Are you sure, pal? There's still me and Selina here, right?" I asked again.  "Yeah. I already bought the tickets.." He said in a deadpanned tone.  I nodded, "When is your flight? I'll go see you off."  "There's no need. I'll be fine. Anyway, my flight is three days later."  "So fast?" I blinked.  Shawn nodded, "Yup. You're a great friend, Louis. If we have the fate, we will see each other again.."  We gave each other a quick hug, "Help me tell Selina to take care. You too." He said.  "I will." I replied and watched him leave the ward. Three days later...   __________________________________________  Meanwhile, at Hebe's side..  +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  "So the flight's three days later okay? We will see each other then again, Mr Tian." Mr Okaedo said, smiling gleefully, revealing his ugly yellow teeth.  "See you then.." My father smiled back, giving that same awful gleeful smile.  Three days later.. I will be leaving this country.. Where all my memories are held.. Or maybe, through Takeshi's help, I will not?   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Fate is the most ironic thing. It can bring two people together, yet it can also break the same two people apart.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+ There was something wrong with Hebe.. I just knew it from the look in her eyes.. She seems to be hiding something from me. Why would she want to marry that Okaedo guy anyway? It's just unbelievable! She has always objected the idea, why suddenly accept it? There must be something she's hiding from me! I insisted and got up from my bed.  I decided to pay Hebe a visit.. and find out what is up..  __________________________________________________  I arrived at Hebe's house and rang the doorbell. It was Hebe who opened the door and she threw me a frustrated look before slamming the door open and walking into the house.  I walked in automatically. "What do you want, Shawn?" She asked me in an exasperated tone.  "I just wanna know why you're agreeing to marrying that Okaedo guy.." I said in a patient tone in contrast with Hebe's frustrated voice.  "I'm doing it for my father.. H-He really wants me to do this, and he needs the money.." Hebe answered, her back facing me, stammering a bit.   "Hebe! Anyone can tell you're lying! Can you please tell me the real reason?" I asked, feeling annoyed and a little cheated.  "There isn't any other reason.." She said simply, in a deadpanned tone.  "Then.. then.. W-What about m-me?? I can tell there is something special in between us.. During the kiss.. u enjoyed it.. We had so many good times together.. Can you forget that? Or my assumption is actually wrong? Y-You don't have any f-feelings for me at all??" I blurted out what I had wanted to say for ages and ages..  Hebe didn't reply me, but her back was still facing me. "Hebe Tian! Answer me!" I placed my hands on her shoulders and force her to turn around to face me. What shocked me was that Hebe was crying.  "He-Hebe??? Why are you crying? I'm so sorry. Please dry your tears.." I brushed her tears away. It pains me to see her cry..   "Shawn.. Let me tell you the real reason.." Hebe took a deep breath and stopped crying. "I can't forget Edison.. Whenever I'm with you, I always think of Edison.. I feel like I'm betraying you.. But.. But.. I love Edison so much.. I can't forget him.. I.. I can't be with you.."  Dumbfounded, I stared at Hebe blankly. Is that the real reason? She can't forget Edison? "If you really can't forget him, why are you marrying someone else.. Someone you don't even love?" I voiced out my opinion.  "Precisely. Because I don't love him, that's why I don't feel like I'm betraying Edison.. I know I'm selfish.. but that's the way I am.." Hebe stated in a matter-of-fact tone.  "But if you have feelings for me, can you forget me?" I probed again.  "Don't you understand, Shawn? I love Edison more than you. I love a dead person more than you! It's so unfair to you.. It's different, Shawn. You and him are two totally different people.." Hebe squeezed her eyes shut and turned around to back-face me again.  "How so different? Why can't you love him like you loved him?" I know I was forcing her, but I couldn't help myself..  "Becuase I already love him! Because when he died, he took this big part of my heart away and left a big hole inside.. From then on, I never loved anyone whole-heartedly. Because that part is taken away by Edison. Do you get it? And paintings will forever and paintings.. Not photographs. Paintings express feelings, while.. photographs.. they are just a bunch of memories... You can paint the most beautiful thing on Earth.. you can paint out a lot of things. But you can't take a picture of the most baeutiful thing on Earth. Photographs are just that typical, that practical! That is the difference between the two of you.. That is what I need from Edison.. And while paintings remain paintings, photographs remain as photographs.. You can't ever invert them or replace each other. Because no matter how alike they are, they are still different.." Hebe said all of these without stopping.   These words she said enlightened me.. I got what she meant.. but.. I didn't want to face the fact that Hebe was going to leave me..   "I'm sorry Shawn, I prefer paintings.." Hebe turned to walk away from me.  __________________________________________________  +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  This isn't exactly lying. It's part of the truth.. I'm only not telling him the more important part of it..  I should stop thinking about Shawn.. I'm getting married soon.. To another guy I totally don't love.. I think this time I'm really disappointing Edison.. I finally understood that Edison wanted me to lead my life happily, and not to sink myself in misery..   "Find your happiness" that was on the Valentines day present Shawn gave me.. Find my happiness. Will I ever be able to do that?  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  The most painful way to miss someone is to be standing right next to the person and knowing that he can never be yours  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ I stared up at the ceiling as a big fat tear rolled down my cheek even though I tried very hard to hold back my tears. This time, it was I who hurt someone, not the one getting hurt. I finally realised hurting someone you love is even worse than getting hurt.  More tears coursed down my cheeks as I lay on my side on the bed and the scene yesterday replayed in my mind.  --FLASBACK__  I clenched my jaw as I walked into my father's hotel suite. I was determined after days of avoiding him to object this marriage. Nothing could stop me...  As I walked in, I could see my father leaning against his bed and looking at me sarcarstically. I opened my mouth to say something when he threw something from the bed to the ground just in front of my feet. They were photos, photos of me and Shawn.. The words died at my lips.  I picked them up to examine them closely and could see that in all the photographs, both of us were laughing contendedly, if not smiling. I felt anger burning inside me, how can my father invade my privacy this way? "What do you mean by this?" I shouted at him, throwing the photographs back onto his bed, scattering them.  "Nothing. I don't mean anything. Just happen to know that you have a boyfriend now." My father replied, rolling his eyes and taking a sip from his drink on the bedside table.  His stupid face is just making me angrier.. "He's not my boyfriend.." I said, knowing I sounded helpless.  "Whatever. It doesn't matter. I know he is someone important to you.." He said shortly and got off the bed, nearing me.  I had this really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. This isn't a good sign.. "What do you want?"  "You know what I want, Hebe. I'm your father so you're supposed to listen to me. I want you to marry Takeshi. He's a fine guy, most importantly rich." He said in a more patient tone than before.  "I don't want to marry him... I know he's fine and all, but I really don't love him that way.. Especially when he's rich.." I emphasised on the last sentence. I guessed that have made my father extremely angry.  "You're opposing me, is that it?? I do not care about who you love and not.. You're not going to like it if you oppose me and don't marry him.." His voice got louder and louder and his face turned extremely red.  "What are you going to do?" I felt extremely bad, I have a feeling it has something gotta do with the photographs.  "You can guess, can't you? Looks like the person you love is that guy in the picture. But it seems you can never be with the people you love. First Edison, then him... I'm not going to let you and him have a good ending!! If you don't marry Takeshi, then you won't be able to see him again!" He said harshly, looking at me coldly.  "WHAT?" I screamed, "What are you going to do to him?"  "Don't worry. I won't kill him. Maybe just make him lose his job, lose all his loved ones and make him bankrupt? Oh, and I will do the same to all your friends too.." He said it calmly, as if he does this everyday.  "That's as good as killing him!" I shouted indignantly. As well as myself.. I added silently.  "That's right, Hebe. Marry Takeshi and save you and your friends from all these hurt.."  I started whimpering softly, feeling defenceless and vulnerable, like broken glass.. How can one sentence from my father spoil my whole world??  "Hurt him to save him, Hebe.." My father threw me a last sentence before walking out of the suite.  --END OF FLASHBACK__  I clutched my hands together and started crying hysterically. Hurt him to save him.. The sentence my father said kept echoing in my mind. I did hurt him already, but I did that just to save him. I'm sorry Shawn..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  somtimes I like to make believe that we are in this world of our own, the only existing living beings are us. and we are living in a castle of love, loving each other deeply, everyday we could play and play, having each other as company, free from all troubles and worries. but illusions are forever illusions and always different from reality. the hard, cruel reality. Even though so, I would like to stay in my fantasies. Because only in them, I can be with you, forever and ever. And we'll live happily ever after. But, still, I will go back to hoping. ----totally original by me  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+ My eyelids were heavy and I could not open my eyes. Bearily, I woke up and groped for the toilet. Then, I slowly opened my eyes to face the bright sunlight of the morning. I did not cry last night or anything. Surprisingly, I felt as though nothing could hurt me. Maybe it was because of Shawn.. I don't know.  Ding-Dong. There goes the bell. Selina should be up by now, so she will answer the door.. After a while, Ding-Dong. There does the bell again. I completed by morning bathroom routine just as the doorbell rang again and I walked out into the living room. It was empty.  Weird.. Where was Selina? I thought as I opened the door to face Shawn. When I saw him, I started to blush lightly. Good thing I don't blush that easily.. And all I could think of was the kiss two nights before.  Maybe he was thinking of it too, because from where I saw, he looked sort of awkward. "Uh, Come on in." I began, stepping aside to let him into the house. After he walked in, I busied myself with closing and locking the door while he stood gingerly, watching my every move.  "Um, Yah?" I asked, since he was not making any conversation.  "Uh.. I um, found out that Mr Okaedo and his son are going back to Japan next week. And I think they are planning to bring you and your father over." He said without stopping.  I stared at him blankly, "What? Next week? In a week's time? But.. But.. I.. I.."  Shawn looked at me curiously, waiting for me to continue.  "I don't wanna marry him.. How can they do this without my consent? Moreover, in JAPAN..?" I finished her sentence, suddenly feeling weak and vulnerable.  Misery was written all over Shawn's face and he turned to back-face me. "I wish I could do something.. To get you out of this.."  I sighed in defeat, "My father.. It's his decision. I can't go against it.. Because, this time.. he really needs this marriage.."  "And you're just going to give in to him like that?" He responded a little too sharply.   "You think I want to? You think I want to get married? You don't think I want to get out of this misery?" I shot back testily.  And I got back something totally unexpected. Shawn turned around and hugged me. HUGGED me. I did not move, I couldn't. "I'm sorry. I want so much to protect you, but I can't."  I felt my heart melting at these sweet words from him. From this sentence, I knew he really loved me a lot, and I felt fortunate.. To have someone like him in my life..  "I'm sorry Shawn. I have to fulfill my father's wishes. I have to marry Takeshi." I said into his chest, and that was when he pulled back and stared at me in disbelief, hurt and confusion mixed in his eyes.  "I'm so sorry Shawn.." I said and he stepped away. Maybe he couldn't take the explanation.. He just ran out of the house.  I sighed in defeat.. I'm sorry Shawn.. I have my reasons for doing these. I love you so much so much.. only you don't know that.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  I would rather love you in silence, because in silence, I find no rejection.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Selina's Point Of View]_+ The night scenery was beautiful. I walked down the streets, admiring the twinkling stars. I cradled my big tummy and smiled. I was starting to show quite a lot and practically, it really sucks.   Other than the fact that I know inside me, I carry another life, the baby was extremely heavy and always making my back ache and my legs cramp. Just walking a little distance will take a lot of effort. But I camt out of the house anyway, because the night scenery was too good to miss and I was bored at home.  Hebe locked herself in her room and I knew she was distressed and did not want to marry whoever she's supposed to.. I had no idea what to do to help her, so I left her alone to her thoughts.  That was when I realised I was in the wrong place. I had been so deep in thoughts that I didn't even notice I walked into a red light district. I turned and wanted to walk away when something caught my eye.  I looked closer and could see that my assumption previously was correct. I had seen Ahdi in a pub, taking a swig of beer and he seemed really drunk. I tried to walk as fast as I could to enter the pub.  I knew I gained stares and curious looks. This really isn't the place for pregnant women... I walked towards Ahdi, took the beer out of his hands and poured it all onto the ground. He stared up at me blankly for a while before squinting at me.  "Who are you? Bobo? Is that you? Why did you leave me? You came back?" He said out loud, grabbing my hands and pulling me towards him.  Upon hearing his words, I felt my heart sinking and I wanted to run away from his grip but my strength couldn't be measured up to his. "Don't leave me Bobo.."  Right now, I could feel tears forming at the corner of my eyes. He had mistaken me as that Bobo person. Hearing my loved one pining for another person is really breaking my heart.. "All right, all right. But let's leave this place, all right?" I spoke softly and Ahdi nodded, pulling me out of the pub.  I don't know where he was taking me, but I followed all the same. Then, he suddenly stopped and leaned closer. I realised he wanted to kiss me and I stretched my tired arms out to push his chest away. With my heart hammering hard against my chest, I tried with all my might to resist Ahdi, but he was really strong.   Tears spilled out of my eyes as I gave up, letting my hands fall. Expecting the worst, I shut my eyes tightly shut and waited. A kiss, is supposed to be a beautiful thing. But, why? must it turn out like that? That I'm afraid of Ahdi's kisses?  But Ahdi's lips never came. I heard struggling sounds and opened my eyes in surprise. I saw Louis was the person that saved Ahdi from kissing me and that they were starting to fight.  Ahdi ran to my side and gripped my arms hard again. He glared at Louis and said, "Who are you? Are you Bobo's new boyfriend? Bobo, how can you do this to me? Don't snatch her away from me!"  More tears coursed down my cheeks as I heard those words come out of Ahdi's mouth. Louis took a look at my expression and clenched his fists. He took a step foward and punched Ahdi right in the nose. And Ahdi flew back to the ground. Louis then grabbed my wrist and took me out of there.   I looked back just in time to see Ahdi's pain-filled expression on his face before a crowd gathered around him.   We reached the street where I was walking on before I stepped into the red light district. And I crumbled onto a bench in the park. Louis sat down beside me, not muttering a word.  The next thing I did was totally unexpected. I swung my arms around Louis' neck and buried my head into his shoulder. I knew he must have been extremely shocked. I started sobbing uncontrollably and I could feel Louis hugging me comfortingly back. I felt safe and comforted in his arms...  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Don't go for looks, they can deceive. Don't go for wealth, even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile.   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      Continuation from last chapp-- +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  While Shawn was dozing off, I shook his shoulder lightly and he opened his eyes blearily. "Hey, I better go back.."  "Oh.. Um, I send you home?" He asked, rubbing his eyes and standing up from his sofa. "Uh, no need.. You so sleepy, go to bed, don't bother already.." I turned to leave but he held on to my shoulder.  "I think I better send you home. It isn't safe for a lone girl to go home this late.. It's like 10 pm already.." Shawn insisted and he took his car keys from the table and ushered me to his car.  I reluctantly agreed and got into his car. All the way, He concentrated on the road while I spaced out, looking out of the side window, my back facing him. Silence filled the gap in between us.  "We've reached." Shawn announced and stopped the car in front of my apartment. I stared up at it, I was so absorbed in my own thoughts that I didn't even know I have reached home. I opened the car door and saw that Shawn opened his too.   "Hebe, um, are you going to be okay?" He asked in concern, jogging over to me, so that the distance between us is only a few inches.   "Huh? Oh, yeah. I'll be all right." I answered after hesitating for a moment. I looked up at Shawn's face and he looked back at me. There was a moment of silence.  Then, before I knew what was happening, I could see Shawn leaning closer and closer and closer.. Before the thought that Shawn was going to kiss me atually processed to my brain, I just did what was natural. I closed my eyes and waited until his lips touched mine.  His lips were soft and gentle, and I was overwhelmed with joy. I didn't know exactly how long we stood there this way, but we finally broke away. When I opened my eyes, his eyes were still closed. Then, he suddenly opened them and started running towards the driver seat of the car.  Then, he drove away. I stood dumbly outside my house, watching the car going out of sight before walking up to my apartment. I didn't know why, but there was a little skip in my steps and I felt excited and light-hearted just like a little kid whom her mother bought sweets for..  I can't believe Shawn and I actually kissed! From the moment we did, I knew for sure that I had fallen in love with him. I sighed in exasperation. I wasn't supposed to fall in love with anybody else except for Edison... But the problem is.. I did...  As I jangled the keys in my hands, I twisted the lock and once I got into the house, Selina cornered me and pressed me against the door.  "What?" I asked her in surprise.  "Explain." She pointed at a newspaper in her hand and thrusted it into my hands. I lifted it up and looked at it. It was an article about my father coming to New Zealand... I scanned through it, it did not say anything about my hostility to my father, thankfully. I should thanks Shawn for this.  "What? It's just my father coming to New Zealand. What's wrong with that?" I asked in a light tone, pressing the paper back into Selina's hands.  "What's wrong? What is wrong is that your father hates New Zealand, he doesn't come here! And look what the paper says, it says he is bankrupt." Selina pointed at somewhere on the paper and looked back at me.  "Nearly bankrupt." I corrected and tried to get away from Selina, but she blocked my way and I sighed, "What? He is nearly bankrupt? So? What has that gotta do with me?"  "Look again, Hebe. It says that your father may suggest you marry some rich guy that can bring his company up again." Selina summarized from the paper. Darn that newspaper company! "Is he wanting you to do that?"  I nodded wearily. "Yes."  Selina looked shell-shocked at me. "You don't even have a single say in this?"  I shook my head mutely, not too trusting my voice. Selina put down the paper and hugged me. "Don't worry Hebe. I will never allow you to marry someone you don't love... And I know you won't allow yourself to either."  I hugged her back tightly, "Thanks, Se, for the support."  "Right, now, down to business. What were you and Shawn doing downstairs?" She broke away and asked me, looking at me accusingly.  I could feel a blush creeping up my neck. She saw us? Oh god! Selina started laughing like a mad woman, "You two are great!" She patted my back and tried her best to stop laughing, but it didn't work. I slapped my forehead and touched Selina's belly.  "How's my niece?" I asked, changing the subject.  "How you know it would be a girl?" She asked, looking at me weirdly.  I shrugged, "Hunch. Not sure."  She raised her eyebrow and turned to look at my hand placed on her belly gently.  "I'm just wishing this baby won't take after his or her father's character." She said, stroking her stomach and looking at it sadly.  I smiled encouragingly at her. "Don't worry. I'm sure my dear niece will take after her mother's loving and sweet nature. Stop thinking about that heartless jerk already all right?"  Selina looked up and smiled back at me.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  They are like fallen angels, always there for me when I need them, willing to share weal and woe with me, be by my side no matter what.. But I don't call them angels, I call them friends.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

      +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+ I opened the door and was greeted by a crying Hebe with her right cheek all red and swollen. Her eyes were red from the crying and her face was stained with tear trails. She looked listless and tired. I was shocked to see her in this state and I led her to sit down and I took a drink for her.  As I came out with the drink, I could see Hebe desperately trying to wipe her tears away, but it was no use, her tears just kept falling from her eyes. I was afraid that what Jimmy had assumed had come true. Placing the cup of tea on the table in front of her, I sat down beside her and asked concernly, "What happened Hebe? Don't cry already all right."  I placed my hands at the sides of her face and brushed her tears gently away. She stared up at me in bewilderment and said, "My father wants me to marry the pervert's son.." Her tone was soft and filled with sorrow, her eyes never leaving my face.  Feeling concious, I quickly withdrew my hands away from her face and stuffed them in my pockets. Jimmy was right, her father really wanted her to marry some rich young master to help build up his company funds again. But never did I ever thought that it would be the pervert Okaedo's son? What if his son was just like him?  Hebe seemed to know my mind, because she said, "His son is very nice. It was he who helped me get out of the trouble.. But the thing is, no matter how nice it is, I don't love him, and I don't want to marry him.."  Yes, I know you don't love him, Hebe. Who do you love, then? I wanted to blurt that out, but the words died at my lips once I saw Hebe's hurt expression.   On impulse, I wrapped my arms around her and hugged her. Once I did that, I regretted it. What was I thinking? I mentally scolded myself. She would probably ignore me for the rest of my life.. I felt her body rigid and stiff in my arms, but slowly she relaxed and leaned against me slightly.  Her sobbing had stopped too. I guess hugs are great cures for crying? I slowly let go of her and I peered into her face, trying to see if there was any anger or anything in her eyes. But I didn't see any trace of it.   I was still quite close to her and she moved back a little, looking away and breaking the stare.  +_[Hebe's Point Of View]_+  I didn't know what was happening.. When he touched my face just now, I could feel my heart.. thumping really fast.. And when he hugged me, I felt shocked, but in his arms, I felt safe, secured and.. loved.. Like he would protect me and save me from any harm..  And, now my heart is still above normal beating rate. Am I falling for Shawn? Could I be? But indeed, I felt comforted after his hug and I could think straight now. I turned back to face him and said, "I really don't want marry him, Shawn.. What am I supposed to do?"  "I-I.." That was all he could say.. I guess he couldn't find a solution to this problem either... Then, I wondered what Edison would have thought of? He would have suggested elope. But.. Shawn and I aren't lovers or anything..  I brandished away that thought, staring up at the ceiling.  +_[Shawn's Point Of View]_+  I felt so useless. As Hebe looked up at the ceiling and hugged her knees to her chest, I lectured myself for being so stupid not to give any hope to her just now when she asked what she was supposed to do.  "Shawn, you still remember that talented artist I talked to you about?" Hebe suddenly said, making me look at her in surprise.  "Was he your boyfriend?" I blurted out in spite of myself.  She slowly shook her head, "He was more than that. He was my fiancè."   That sentence. Just that sentence. I felt like a hand was squeezing my heart and shattering it into many pieces. But then, I thought about the word "was". She used the word "was".. What happened to him?  "His name was Edison. He died.." She answered, as though reading my mind. I stared at her, but she was not crying or anything. She was just staring into space.. That was why I felt she had a surge of lonliness coming from her the first day I met her.   Because the person she loved a lot has died and left her alone in this world... "We loved each other a lot. And he died on our engagement day.." She continued, still staring blankly at the ceiling.  I felt sad for Hebe and Edison.. even though she was with another man. She must have suffered a lot then. "Edison was the only one who understood me.. He was the only one who knew how to care for me, he opened my heart up.. The day I met him, was on the beach.. He was painting the scenery..."  I kept silent, not sure of what to say. "I miss him Shawn.. I miss him.."  Then, we were silent. And we remained this way..  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  If I could be anything, I want to be your tears. So I can be born in your eyes, live on your cheeks and die on your lips.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
