       Watch battle two on June 6th.  FYI...I'll be watching  Just got home from work.  I'm actually at home in Port Moody!  I haven't been home since Thursday.  I was planning to head home lastnite, but started watching Lord of the Rings 3 got sleepy, passed out and well...went straight to work.  I don't think my mother is impressed with me.  I bought a spring jacket today from the store I don't like shopping from...Aritzia.  I really needed a spring jacket, this one was cute, not to expensive and has a hood.  I have sooo many clothes, but I get sooo bored of them so easy and always look scruffy.  I should really utlize my wardrobe more.  Another thing, I have way too many pairs of shoes.  Especially heels...and I don't wear them much.  I can wear runners to work, flip-flops to the beach and heels to clubs which only occurs once a week.  I don't like wearing heels to work, because if I take the train, I have to walk from the station to work and it's BUMPY!  I was just on Robson today and saw even more pairs of heels that I want to buy.  Fuck it!  I'm gonna buy another pair...tomorrow.  Fine, purchase verified.  I'm so excited Cathy and Ricky are moving into their new place this weekend.  I had a nice evening with Cathy and he boy toy Ed yesterday at the beach.  We had beer, pizza and they blazed.  Of course, VDV had to be the ring leader there.  Went to Sonar on Saturday with Nina...I'm never going back on a Saturday.  Someone was stabbed!  Freakin' AI's.  Horsey is playing at Lucy Mae Brown on Friday.  If you're up for a chill nite, come with MC!  Hapi Nite!

       Once again, I'm at work early...5:45!  But I'm excited to see Cirque de Soleil today after work.  Wow!  I've been so busy this morning, haven't really had the chance to complete this.    Will be seeing 9 & G-string tomorrow.  It'll be our weekly routine "Go hard or go home night".  I don't know where we'll be wandering to, but I hope somewhere with good music, good food and red wine!  Maybe homebase?  I know string-a will be be happy with that?  But remember babe...Saturdays aren't the best to the loti.  and there is no way I'm going to a venue with top 40!  Oh ladies, please don't ask me to hit Granville.  I guess we could make an appearance at Bar-no-fun for some hip-hop.  I have been practicing some ass shakin' moves from BET.  LMTY, I've been praticing for the past 6 years in the washroom after shower time.. he he.  I have to work tomorrow.  Boo!  HOW WORKS ON SATURDAYS???  That means I have to take it easy tonite.    I had an awesome day yesterday, regardless of the rain.  Went to west 4th with le boi.  He bought the world, not to mention some cool shoes!  I'm so glad my boy wears awesome footwear.  He got a pair of brown Lakai's with a gum sole.  D-O-P-E!  I got a roxy bikini (it was soooo expensive) and a pair of billabong board shorts!  CUTE!  Hopefully I can go surfing somewhere this summer.  Anyone up for Tofino?  Had an awesome dinner (pesto/balsamic chicken, pasta with pancetta, and a strip of NY sirloin---YUM!)  I also blazed yesterday!  My goodness, I was so zonked.  I rarely ever smoke!  I used to when I was a student, all through high school...but gave it up for no real reason, probably one of those things you give it.  I just didn't like being so lethargic in public.  But I don't mind the occasional stone and bone (he he he dirty MC).    I just had lunch, i had yesterday's dinner...some weird reason it's making me feel ill.  YUK!  Better get my ass in full work mode!    Hapi Day

       Holy jeez!  It's exactly 6:58am at the momento.  It will probably take me the majority of the morning to finish this.  There's a schedule mix up here, I'm suppose to work 7-3, but it's mandatory to add 5 more hours of OT to catch up this week!  An extra 5hours even after working Sunday and Monday!  WTF! Nevertheless, I decided to work 5:45-4 today to put an extra 2.25 hours today HOWEVER, my schedule wasn't adjusted!  Jeepers!  Well, I came at 5:45, so I'll be paid from 5:45!  Anyways, that was my daily banter.    Now on to bigger and better things...  I had an awesome dinner lastnite.  I went to T & T yesterday afterwork.  LMTY (let me tell you), the beef short rib was on sale for $2.99 per lb, regular $6.99!  So 2pounded that baby, headed to VDV-sters and made some sinigang and bbq/grill beef ribs with a Japanese "Yakiniku" sauce.  We ate it all!  We actually VDV's friend Jeff came over.  He seems to always come by at the right time.  He's always good times to eat with.  You see, I really like eating with people that enjoy the food just as much as I do.  Perhaps, that could be why I like hanging out with VDV.  He always eats in such a barbarous manner.  He always piles a mammoth sized portion on his plate!  It's comical.  Come eat with us sometime!  arggg...   I've known my best friend Joanne for 25.75 years of my life.  Our parents met at Army and Navy in Saskatchewan in 1978 when they were prego with us.  We grew up together, and we're still friends.  I used to finish all of her food when we were kids.  The end result:  I'm not 5"2 and Joanne stands at 4"11.  So keep feeding those kids.  But I could be 5"4..see I'm flat footed, if I got surgury done, it would straighten the alignment of my back..making me taller.  But I don't want to go through the pain.  It's now 8:27am and I'm starving!  I think I'll go on a break and get something to eat.  But I hate eating this early in the morning, but I was up at 4:45 this morning!  That's the time that nurses and farmers get up for work!  I just had tomato soup and it's not 9:45, too early!  Who eats that kind of food at this time?  I have lunch at 11!  That's way to early.  I don't have a lunch today, I thought they'd be serving lunch here today..I'M WRONG!  I'm going to be hungry.  Well time to close this off.  I have the day off tomorrow!  More banter...HOW strange is it to have Thursday off?  This is not normal, I need Sat and Sun off for recoup purposes.  Now that's off my chest, I can continue my lovely job!  Hapi Hapi Wednesday!

       Guess what time I started work today?  7am!  Apparently I was expected to be here at 6:45 to do some pre-reading to be ready for work, but I didn't get here at that time!  Boo.  I'll be here til 4:30 today for overtime!  Jeez...hopefully it won't be sunny outside, otherwise I'll feel depressed that I'm not enjoying the sun.  Had an awesome time yesterday at Cathy's celebration yesterday.  The weather was beautiful, the food was savory (mountainous amounts) and everyone was in a good mood!  I love summer.  Everyone gets nicely tanned!  I ate so much.  I was told yesterday "Everytime I see you, you're munching Marie..thats why you have that little belly!".  Little belly huh?  I'm kinda sad about it, but I'm the most starved person ever (well thats the way it looks everytime I'm stuffing my face).  I guess I should slow down on the consumption amount or else I'll have a tire!  he he.  I can't help it!  I love food!  This Friday I see Cirque de Soleil with VDV!  I'm so pumped!  It should be fun.  VDV is great!  He got the best tickets!  However,  I heard from Gladys that with the tent set-up that they have at this show, it doesn't matter what seat you have in the house.  It's all the same.    I just looked out the window..it's gloomy :( boo.  The forecast doesn't look very nice for the ret of the week.  I'm at work right now, I noticed..why do most of the guys that work here have ugly shoes?  I see a lot of men with fancy Nike runners with silver piping on it!  Like yuk!  I guess I'm a devotee to the urban fashionista look.    Well, I'm at work right now and it's CRAZY here!  I have about 10 programs open on my computer, it's so confusing!  But it's making the time go by so fast.  I saw a girl on the floor in the washroom this morning.  Maybe she's overwhelmed with the new change.  She was lying next to the toliet..gross!  I felt so bad for her.  She was shaking.  Poor gal :(  I guess I should really get back to work.  I have to be here at 6am tomorrow morning!  Holy early birdzies huh?  Hapi PM all!

       Hapi Victoria Day!  I'm spending this national holiday in an office located on Nootka and Broadway.  How else would I like to spend this dull weathered day than here at work???  Like it's so COLD outside right now.  Jeez, get me outta here and onto the beach..need to really work on the UV.  I'll be outta here at 3, meeting Brian M., Bryan Y. and the famous Eugene, then heading to Spanish Banks.  Eugene says he wants to pick up a slab of Angus Beef to launch on the grill.  We are the carnivores of the west!  Wearing my new Juicy flip flops today and they suck!  They make too much noise when I walk.  On Friday I got a pair from Off the Wall.  So much cheaper...and way more comfortable.  Gots to get back to work!

       Didn't think I was going to make it through work today.  Participated in the usual festivity at the Rowing Club.  Breakfast and lunch were both served at work today.  That is the least they could do...who works during long weekend?  It was awesome...there was some problem with the network for about 45mins.  so we couldn't use our computers.  So I chatted on the phone!    Tonite it's Bryan's birthday (Joanne's lil' bro--actually not really that little), we're making a huge bbq!  His friends are all grown up now...awww...maybe they'll be hotties???I'll be needing a good feeding after lastnite.  Did I mention I had a great time?  It was just the main room...Too many "raver-types" with no shirts on, some guy in a g-hole in the corner (attention paramedics) and AI's there trippin' out...like control yourself!!  But I had an awesome time dancin' to some fun house!    Tomorrow work again!  Argg...but we will be feed at work and I'll be paid 3.5 tomorrow (double pay plus overtime) yeah!.  I have to work next Saturday too.  I haven't worked on the weekend in like FOREVER!  But I needed to trade so I could go to Cirque de Soleil because someone booked the tickets for 4pm and was suppose to be 8pm.  Regardless, I am looking forward to the show.  I hear so many good things about it.    I'm going to try to make it home early tonite so I can finally have some relaxing time on my own.  I haven't really had much down time lately.  I actually have been home much lately...I kinda miss it, its soooo clean and cozy here.  Hopefully, I can have a bubble bath before bed tonite!  I look forward to it!

       Got a haircut today with the lovely VDV.  I tried so hard to get work off today, but there was no way they would give it to me off.  Wanted to hit West 4th, go for Cambodian lunch, pick up some yummy food to cook, meet up with G and 69er early for drinks and relax.  I have a bit of a hang over today.  I went to Cactus club and Brass Monkey for drinks...and you know me, I had a few.  I was pretty tipsy.  I stumbled back to VDV's and I was trying to have a cigarette on his patio but nearly hit my head.  What a drunk!  This weekend should be fun!  Cathy's bday tomorrow nite at the Rowing Club.  Gots to work on Sunday and Monday.  BBQ at Joanne's on Sunday and BBQ at the beach on Monday for Cathy's bday...she's a real princess.  It's Lacey's wedding tomorrow.  I have a choice of 2 outfits to wear.  One is a 2 piece dress, all different colours, kinda 70's ish.  The other has this green stuff going on, very cute too.  Both kinda old, from Aritzia(I really don't like that store anymore--its so BORING and sooo ASIAN).  But these dresses are cute!  I'm excited!  Everyone is leaving work now...I'm waiting for my e-mail confirmation to let me go early!  Nothing yet.  I wanna go!  I wanna go now!    I had such an awesome lunch today.  Had Korean and Japanese food.  Very tasty.  That just makes me think about Jamie Oliver.  I love him.  The Guu on Thurlow street has the BEST looking Japanese guy working there.  He is so my type!  He was rated the #1 looking guy by Ooops Magasize (Japanese).  He can really work that wok!  For those of you that don't know, I love chef's.  They drive me crazy.  Arrgg....

       This is the first time I'm using this.  I'm kinda excited about it.  I'm at work at the moment.  There isn't much for me to do here this week.  We're switching to a new system next week, so a lot of programs are frozen.  I actually got off work early yesterday!  That was nice.  So I headed downtown to met Cathy, took her to Guu for her pre-birthday celebration.  It was also nice to see some old faces too.  I'm trying to get tomorrow off work to get my hair cut and coloured.  I go to this Japanese salon where they just butcher my hair with those crazy tools that they have.  I'm not sure about the colour, but it'll probably end up with some trendy Japanese colour.  Something that you would see in those Ray and JJ fashion magazines that are sooo popular in Japan.    This weekend should be full of fun!  It's Lacey's wedding on Saturday and VDV is actually going with me.  Thats if he finds something thats not t-shirt and jeans like.  Sunday and Monday I'll have to work.  Since we're going to be preparing for the big launch at work.  But I'm going out on Saturday and Sunday.    I'll have to finish this later...I just got an e-mail...I can go home early today!  Yippie!

       Welcome to Tuesday.  I'd have to say I'm happy with my new office arrangements.  Sitting next to the "weirdest" guy in the office.  Then theres a guy across from me aka. Mr. Rap-ta-tude.  Has a comment for anything.  Like shut up!  Had a great Monday evening.  Had some bev's on the Sand Bar patio.  The weather was nice, the people were great and the pint of Alexander Keith's was refreshing.    Oh my...embrassing update at work.  I was just sipping on some water when my co-worker made a comment that was soooo funny.  I threw up/spat up all the water all over the place.  Whatever!  I'm used to this.    Yippie!  Knowing that I have Canada off is great.  I'm tired of typing.  See Ya!

       MC's weekend review.  Fri-Yaletown Brew Pub with co-workers.  Had no dinner prior to 3 beers, 2 shots and 3 highballs.  Danced to house at Bar-No-Fun (Bar None) for a bit after paying $15 for cover change.  Well, thanks to VDV.  Then headed to Sonar to hear Felix the House Cat.  Wicked music.  Was the only one dancing.  The crew of boys and Crystal were all lethargic on the sidelines.  Night ended when Crystal the Bimbo had the good ol' yacky yack yack.  There was a contribution to the right side elevator at the Sandpiper where VDV resides.   Sat-Was in bed for most of the day.  Threw up a few times after VDV went to work.  Rotten stomach.  Headed to an Indian wedding.  Open bar, lamb curry, chili chicken and other yummies that I don't know the name to.  VDV passed out in the car.  Then G and I headed to Aqua looking all casual.  We know no one, but some how, MC and G get to surpass the line and pay close to nothing for cover.  How we do it?  It's probably the bar staff feeling sorry for 2 normal looking girls like us.  Not like those overly done up girls that hit the bar, order every single drink then have an ol' geezin' man pay for it all.  GROSS!  These gals look great...all glam, nice bodies and great clothes...but at the end of the day---they have a guy that they don't really love paying for all their stuff, brain less bimbos with no education.  BUT, G and I really enjoyed the music.  It was nice to be in a place that plays awesome house!  Hit the 7-11 and hit the sack.  Sun-One of my best Sundays this year.  Had lunch with VDV's fam.  Really nice people.  Went to Tanpopo.  Food was ok, but will not be returning there anytime soon.  Enjoyed the rest of the day walking in sun and taking some awesome photos.   Ended the weekend with an awesome meal and MC blazed!  Went to bed super stoned, the room was spinning and I had a mini nightmare.  I was trying to get up out of the bed and call for VDV, but I couldn't get up or talk.  Finally made it to the door when I snapped out of the trance.  I've never experienced anything like that in my life.  Crazy.    I'm really looking forward to having this Thursday off!  Canada Day!  Yippie!  Can't wait to hit Cultus!   Hapi Week All!

       Yippie it's the weekend!  The plans are:  Tonite:  Hit Yaletown brew pub for a few bevvies with co-workers.  Maybe hit Sonar.  VDV mentioned that Lee wants to do something before he leaves for Europe on Sunday.  Saturday:  Lunch with someone(haven't asked anyone yet, but I do want to go for eats).  Indian wedding at night time.  Should be fun!  I'm excited!  Next Thursday is Canada Day.  G, L-dawg, VDV, footer and I are heading to Cultus Lake for the day.  Leaving YVR @ 7:30am in the FunBus (the Les-mobile).  Hoping the weather is going to be nice.  We're going to have a day of fishin', swimmin', SeaDooin' and BBQ'.    Had a weird day yesterday, but spent rest of the evening with VDV.  Went to Cafe Glouchester on Cambie..I love that place.  VDV pigged out!  We've got to go there again soon!  Hapi Weekend!

       after reading gladysli.blogspot.com, i'm feeling the same.  i'm actually feeling really down, to the ground here at work today.  hence, not using capital letters...how grammatically incorrect.    the pot that has boiling for years:  "the Momsters" aka: monsters....  MC is really needing a sedative today.   very stressed.  my disfunctional family life has been an ongoing brain rotting problem.  bringing unhappiness to both parties that are included in my family.  i understand that yes, i am lucky to have the house, free food, no rent, laundry done, free everything at home..but that just is: the asian way.  only thing being: a threat of staying at home.    parents:  they need to feel that you need them.  if in the event you spend too much time with a boyfriend, you automatically don't need them.  it could be the single-mom insecurity.  honestly, i don't know and i don't want to look into it any further.  what i do know:  i do need to make some major decisions.  i'm not happy at the moment.  i do like the job.  but i need to get my living arrangements in gear.  i want to be somewhere i feel comfortable and welcome.  i think it's time for me to settle down, find somewhere to live, find a roomie and just into a cozy place.    until then:  deal with this stress, take deep breaths and take it one day at a time.  the international ESL/traveling world is what my heart desires.  MC the only child can do this on her own!!! gambatte!

       wow!  What great weather Vancouver has had lately!!  My skin colour has changed by at least 5 shades since last week.    I recommend the Seafood Chop Salad at the Boathouse.  The salmon is yum!  Cold smoked!  the salad is $16 but worth it.  The boathouse doesn't have anything too creative, but the quality is pretty good.  They use good ingredients.  My one food banter of the day:  Caesar salad is sooo boring!   Had a great weekend.  Enjoyed it with good friends on Saturday night.  Awesome weather on the patio at the Rowing Club.  Music wasn't as good tho.  Sunday all day at the beach with my buddie!  Blazing heat!  Finished off nicely with a few pints of Alexander Keith's and a Caesar.  Even better!    VDV's fridge is not resting in Peace.  RIP lil' guy.  It had a lil' gas blow-out and now resides in a dumpster off Denman Street.  Had some good times with that thing.  Now no food exists...BOO :(  MC will be hungry at VDV's.  Hapi Tuesday!

       just outside the office.  Employees are flocking to their Team Managers to get their free ice cream vouchers.  My choice was the "Super Mario Ice Bar with a Mystery Coloured Gumball".  It was purple and gross.  But the poppy was refreshing!  Had a roast beef sandwich from the cafe for lunch.  Costing $4.75.  Included about 10 original ripple Old Dutch potato chips.  What a rip!  Oh dear, the office cougar just walked by.  Wearing a grey cotton SHORT dress with see-through plastic heels.  Hooker at Bell.  Totally lacking professionalism.  I've had to wear glasses the past week.  GPC infection is bugging me and I really don't want to go out tonite with glasses.  Geeky MC!  Have a hapi weekend!  Call me Mr. Raider call me Mr. Wrong I know what I want and I want it now! I want you 'cause I'm Mr. Vain. I know what I want and I want it now! I want you 'cause I'm Mr. Vain

       1.  Jenn.  Just got an e-mail from her.  Reporting on her travels through South East Asia and now in India.  Sent me some photos and WOW...amazing.  Poor children in Burma, dead animals in the Ganges and tons of temples.  Felt my heart hit the ground.  Just makes me think what the hell am I doing in Vancouver!  A few years ago, I did the whole South East Asia tour and got a good idea of poverty.  But being back in Van. I find myself spending weekends clubbin', drinkin', smokin', eatin'..etc...really things that I don't really need to do.  Pretty much wasting my cash.  I should really get my ass back in gear and do more traveling.  and stop wasting food.  2.  The weekend.  So many small but fun activities.  I'll be playing for the Bell Mobility volleyball team on Saturday all day!  It's at the 24hour relay.  There's a beer garden there!  Yippie.  Most of all it's for a good cause!  I'm on the same team as the Western Region manager.  That should be fun.  Hoping to darken a few more shades.    3.  Office Space.  More and more I think about teaching ESL/TESL again.  Buzzin' around the office, adjusting accounts, dealing with a**holes that want the world from their cellphone and just being a number.  Here I'm known as mcamante, MMH, and by employee number.  I look around and see people really into their jobs and caring about how efficient they are...blah blah blah....MC needs to get overseas and teaching!  It's such a nice day today.  VDV is at the Mavi jean sale!  Boo...I wish I wasn't working or at least notified of the sale so I could have gone before work today. Boo, VDV..you're just one of those kids.  Ha ha ha.    Hapi Thursday!  My Mommzie's isn't feeling well today.  Poor Mommy.

       currently 25 degrees.  I can see the brightness from the window across the freakin' room.  In an open concept cubicle, starring in Office Space v.Nootka.    Got off work early yesterday.  Hit the beach for a bit.  MC blazed!  Wow...like that never happens, but I was in the mood.  Ordered 2 meduim pizzas, rented Ghost World and fell asleep 1/2 way.  But another relaxing evening at VDV's.  Didn't feel like going home.  Boring and have to deal with naggy Mommzies.  Arggg...  B & I are starting to do some birthday planning tho it's not 'til the end of July.  It's nice that it falls on a weekend.  I'm wanting to go away somewhere like Caltus or Penticton.  Some swimming, SeaDooing, drinkin', sunnin', BBQ'in', and beach bummin'.  I just hope that people will make the effort to trek out of Vancouver.  But if not, I would be willing to go with a few.  Sun, Sun, Sun, I love the sun.    I'm looking to a great weekend.  Work party--think it's paid by Bell(or I sure hope it is), Anna's birthday, Dragon Boat Festival and the 24hour relay!  I really have to try to make an effort to attend all events.  Next weekend I got invited to an Hindu wedding.  This should be cool.    Hapi Sunny Day!

       Radicchio--something I want to start using more in culinary experimentation.  David Rocco grilled it lightly with olive oil and a balsamic finish.  Honestly, it wasn't really all that experimental.  Restaurants that serve Pacific Northwest cuisine tend to  overdo the use of balsamic, edamame, miso, soy, thai chilli in what they call "fusion" type cuisine.  PLEASE!  I was at a restaurant recently (will not mention the name).  Salad:  Mixed greens, Prosciutto, fried tofu with a soy/sesame dressing.  Since when did Italy met Japan???  Strange combination.  Last culinary banter of the day:  Carbonara is NOT a pasta with a simple Alfredo sauce, veggies and meat.  Carbonara is a non-saucy pasta made with butter, cream, parm, eggs (acting as a sort of adhesive), and PANCETTA--NOT freakin' ham or bacon!  Get it straight.  Places like White Spot, ABC or dive-diner type places tend to make the "North American" version of Carbonara.  Jeez,  I'm not Italian, but it breaks my heart everytime I see impoverished items on a menu.  Sweet and Sour pork, pizza, chicken chow mein from the food court, tacos at Taco time, oriental salads at McDick's--perfect examples!  Yuk, Yuk, Yuk.  Same feelings from Wing.  Haters r us banter...  Office peeve of the day:  women that talk about their boyfriends/husbands non-stop!  Worst:  they refer to their signigicant other on a first name basis.  I really don't know who Micheal, Tony or Patrick are!  They automatically assume you know.  Holy! Like SHUT UP!  Can we have a decent/intellectual conversation for once??  Or they are talking non-stop about their UGLY so called fashions.  First of all, we're at work!  Can you at least maintain some level of professionalism and keep your luggage at home?  Second,  if you do decide to talk about fashion and make-up...at least make it interesting.  Third,  if you are going to talk about fashion--at least look good.  Honestly, these "people"/"they" must've been LOSERS in highschool.    The weather is going to be awesome this week.  Especially on the weekend.  I'm so excited.  I want to hit the beach, go for a walk and hopefully even attend a BBQ.  Someone want to invite me?    I was moody lastnite.  Had a lil' bit of a psycho episode sending a huge bolt all the way up Davie to Thurlow.  Ending in a lil' whimper and having a homosexual look at me indicating wanting to offer aid in midst travesty.  I'm on the edge lately.  Get outta it MC!  Heading to the Cac tonite.  Been there sooo much this year!  But love the halibut and dry ribs.  Yum in the tum.    Hapi Tuesday!

       & banter is the name of the game.  Brain buzz.  Hangover.  Muscle discomfort.  Lack of sleep.  Raspy voice.  =a great weekend.  Debauchery commenced 9pm, Friday night.  B accompanied 10 ladies!  & hotties too.  Ruby's bday was a blast.  Was really nice to see her.  Would like to see her more often.  Think she'll keep me out of the usual "Trucka" intoxicated behavior that comes out the the Lotus or Shine.  Ended up at Tokyo Lounge--STUMBLE LENA to the max!  VDV had to take me home since I was so  HAMMERED .    Okanagan rocked!  Loved the SeaDoo.  Loved hanging out with my awesome friends.  Loved the rednecks.  Loved the view.  Loved the drive.  Loved the water.  Loved the conversations.  Good ol' times with Wing, Kane, B, Toms and Eugenius.  & the tan is coming along.  Thank You all for the drink and dial calls on the weekend.  I got about 5 calls from drunk friends.  Just yelling into the phone.  Just holla at MC because MC loves you!    Moving on to better things.  Plans to come -Just got invited to my co-worker's wedding on June 26th.  How nice! -Would like to go to Victoria/Tofino soon.  Would be willing to skip any Rowing Club events next week.  Hint hint. -Caltus Lake??   -Need to do some research on the ESL industry in Taiwan or Spain.  Love my job stability here at Bell.  Not feeling completely satisfied.   Teaching ESL makes a difference in people.  When I was teaching TESL, a lot of the students would say to me after the class "Thanks MC, you really make me want to go overseas and teach".  I think I prefer a rewarding job.  el plano:  work at Bell 'til October-ish, save enough money for an open-ticket, spending money for 2 months and debt payments for 2 months.  Then I'll be off.  I'm getting restless in Vancouver.  As much as I enjoy Canadian scenery, my awesome friends and most of all VDV...I do enjoy the adventure rush.  Plus, were only young once.  This Penticton trip will be remembered with:  Girl you wanna come to my hotel, baby I will leave you my room key. I'm feelin' the way you carry yourself girl. And I wanna get with you 'cuz you's a cutie. So if you wanna come to my hotel, all you gotta do is holler at me. 'Cuz we're having an after party, checkin' out 6 in the mornin' 6 in the mornin'  check out Wing's blog for the funny details of the trip.  http://gladysli.blogspot.com Hapi Week all!

       Formally #8014 is ready to be "on the road again".  I love mini summer road trip.  Yesterday at work I jumped up in joy.  In glee since Canadian Tire has a website with all summer products--even a photo!    MC:  I'm so excited to go to Canadian Tire.  So many water toys. Co-worker:  I love Canadian Tire too, you never know what you can find there. MC:  Yeah, I haven't bought anything from there in a longtime. CW:  NO I mean, you don't know WHO you can find there. MC:  Yeah, I guess you could find some hot workers there. CW:  No, I mean customers. MC:  Oh...  Comedy at work.  It's cowboy day here.  Yippie Cow-town.  I bought a Mcflurry for lunch and they just handed out ice cream sandwiches to everyone here at work.  2doses of ice cream in a row.  Oh boy.    Recent things that make me feel uncomfortable: 1.  co-workers calling me names like: sweetie, baby, honey, etc...I don't like you!  Get the hint. 2.  ex-romantic interests wanting to go on international trips to places like South America...We are so over and you were never my boyfriend! 3.  was at Cactus Club lastnite and a GROSS man wanted to sit at our table.  ...was really nice to see Holly and Joyce lastnite.  Was like ol' times.  Once again sharing our funny stories.  and LMTY..I pigged out.  Spinach salad, green beans, dry ribs and chicken tenders.  Oink Oink.  I feel like such a pig.  Even more, I eat almost double the amount of what le boi VDV eats in one day.    Here I come Penticton  Let me see the tootsie roll Cotton candy sweet to go, let me see that Tootsie Roll To the left, to the left, to the right, to the right  To the front, to the front, to the back, to the back  Now slide just slide baby slide just slide

       @ the moment 13 degrees with light dizzle.  pre-summer?  prepare your lawn for the summer dryness.  Making a reso on a non-secure site is poisoning my mind.  Please don't let this bring a burdensome future for me.    Had brekkie at the Elbow room this morning with le boi.  Indulged in the Lumberjack.  4 pieces of toast, 3 lashes of bacon, 2 links of sausage, 2 eggs over easy, 2 slices of black forest ham and hashbrowns.  Didn't fully complete the meal=donating to the something something spoonfuls (a charity formed to help those that can't regale like me).   I love text messaging.  Most importantly I love receiving them.  Visit www.txt.bellmobility.ca and enter my phone number to send me a text from the internet.  For those of you that are too lazy to text from a phone.  Is it because your phone has lag??? Wahhhh to you too.  Tomorrow the Achy Breaky Heart line dancing competition happens here at work.  I'm going to join fo sho!  Tonite I'll be meeting Holly, Joyce and Joanne for eats.  I haven't hungout with Joyce for a LONG LONGtime.  and Holly...well even longer.  Think last was seeing her at the Aritzia warehouse "hound" sale.  But haven't really hungout with her since BCIT.  Joyce and I have the over eating disorder in common.  Her favorite store is save-on-foods.  We used to carpool together and eat pork chops with rice for breakfast!  She was always eating something.   I have slowed down on consumption since my younger years, but still I can shovel in a good amount for a gal.  That explains the handles.    Just a spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down  Hapi Hapi Thursday... It's almost the weekend Pre-weekend jitters in MC's tummy

       we can begin by -reducing the amount of plastic bags we use.  Like buying groceries, or when shopping for clothing--there is no need for a bag when you buy something small.  Just put it in your purse, or in the bag that you got in the previous store. -reduce the amount of electricity.  Turn lights off when you leave the house. -don't leave the water running when you brush your teeth.  moving on...  Let the weekend plans begin...  to the Okanagan we go!  Tentative plans are:  to leave YVR@7am to drive to Penticton.  Team consists of : B, Eugene, Tomo, G and Les.  I made the reso at the Ramada.  Superb deal on the hotel rate.  2 Queen's, sofa bed, awesome hotel for only $112 + taxes!  The weather is looking nice.  I'll be going out the nite before, but thats not going to get in my way.  I love summers in Penticton.  The drive is beautiful--nice rest areas on the way w/ fresh water streams to play in, fresh fruits (I love cherries) and nice beaches.  Brian and I have planned to rent seadoo's.  I get to practice some new tricks!  and wear my new bikini that I just bought.  It's so cute.  Roxy, stripped and cool material.  Also,  I can wear my new Billabong board shorts too!  I LOVE SUMMER....  Saw Harry Potter lastnite.  Wow it was so exciting.  Then headed to Boston Pizza and had some snacks and of course BEER!  Yippie!  I love Corona w/ lime and Pizza.  Yum Yum.  BP's is always open 'til late too.  Bonus.

       as per http://gladysli.blogspot.com, MC is known as Trucka.  This name has been derived from my obscene behavior under the influence of certain types of bevvies such as Voddys=vodka, soda water and 2 limes--LMTY...this drink is fat free.  Those tutti fruiti drinks are jam packed with calories and the juice will leave you with a nasty hangover.  I suggest to all you ladies, try this drink a couple times.  You'll get used to the strange taste, fall in love with it and not feel so seared in the morning.    BTW, G-string...tell me how familiar are you with the facilities at the Lot? he he  It's a lovely day.  I love that song.  Sunny and here I am at work.    I'm looking horrid today.  I wanted to get my eyebrows done today, then realized the shop is closed on Tuesday.  For what?  Cooking pakora?  Lentils?  Jeez!  MC=Fuzzy wuzzy.  Watched Kandahar lastnite.  Canadian/Afghani women is travelling from Iran to Afghanistan to pervent her sister from committing suicide during the eclipse.  Interesting movie.  Very desert like.  Not sure if VDV liked it, but he's an awesome sport for sticking through the whole movie.    The menu lastnite:  Yaki-udon with okra cut wheeled like, julienned carrots, green onions & a slab of beef side rib seared with pepper and finished with salt--David Rocco style.  He calls it his bistecca.  Also had the traditional corn on the cob.  I like to cut it off the corn so you can shovel into your mouth as the kernels stay together.  Friday seems jammed packed with activities.  Working 'til 9, heading to see Ruby--It's her birthday..can't miss out on that.  She was the first person I meet my first day of school when I transferred to Centennial.  Will hit the chach type places, but starting off with a light meal at La Bodega.  Plan to meet up with my regular bunch at Tokyo Lounge partaking in usual weekend activities which include drinking, talkin' loud and dancin'.  Can't wait to see everyone!  Have a nice day!

       'til we tear it up in Seattle again.  Such great deals.  So cheap.  Not to mention that Babaroonie purchased 8 HALTER tops!  What a nut!  I bought about 8 things=$105 US=$140.  What a score!  Wanted to also purchase a pair of citizens or chip n' pepper jeans, but they didn't have my size.  BOO...It's so cheap for jeans there.  I got a pair of Seven's early last year for $150 Canadian.  Such savings!  We've decided to make a trip every 90days to rack up the credit card and face stress at the border.    .....not to mention, I woke up at 9ish on Saturday.  G, 9 and Brian were waiting for me.  They had called me about 10times until I finally woke up!  I didn't get to sleep 'til 6:30am!  Jeez.  But I had a great time at Shine the night before until I got punched in the unisex toli.  Boo.  I'm tired today.  Got so hammered on Friday.  But enjoyed seeing everyone at Lucy Mae Brown.  Slept for 7hours but suffered all Saturday with a pounding headache.  Went to Shine on Saturday and slept only 3hours!  Lastnite,  I was hoping for a peaceful night, but I did't get to bed 'til 12:30!  Had to be at work today at 7:30.    MC needs peace.  Peace=love and happiness.  Not enough sleep, not enough food=Grumpy MC  This week I would like to: -See a movie, maybe Super size me  -Hit fitness world twice this week -Have at least 1 session of a 12 minute stand up tan -Saturday's forecast is 28, maybe hit the beach and go for a nice walk -Try making a new dish.  Maybe Pad Thai.  Never made it before..it's yum -Finally backup all my files, burn movies,pictures and music..so long overdue! -Get a pedicure  ...for now on, I will start my week/month/year/day, with goals...to keep me organized.  Hapi Monday y'all

       and I'm not working this weekend.  I don't want to put anymore of my time into overtime.  I just ate my first meal of the day...it's 2:24pm.  This is very odd for me, I wake up hungry, go to bed hungry...always hungry.  It also doesn't matter if I've been dropping e's, bizzin', drinking or upset.  Nothing comes in the way of food.  Saw Shrek 2 lastnite.  Awesome.  Funnie.  Creative.  I'm feeling a lot better today.  I suppose it could be that a certain someone could possibly be trying to be a bit more understanding.  Thank You VDV!  Huge learning curve.  Nonetheless,  VDV is fun fun fun 'til her Daddy takes her T-bird awayyyyyy..  Yes, Yes...shopping it is.  Ugly weather on Sunday should be brightened by a larger credit card debit and a tiresome trip in a car.  I'm not a big fan of "road trips".  I'd rather fly, get there fast, and clean.  Car=sardine.  I'm hoping that I don't end up feeling torn tomorrow morning.  I have plans to meet up with Cathy, G, Ricky, and the rest of the cabana at Lucy Mae's.  I'll be showing up with some work people.  I really hope that I don't get carried away after a few drinks.  There have been way to many incidents where...go out for drinks, get tipsy, get loud, more drinks, drunk, really loud, hit the lotus, dance my face off, ignore ugly guys, trip & fall, ....and it's messy fest.  I get all nasty and so does my whole crew.  AHHHHHH...  Jamie Oliver Kaskade VDV my fave boys---do you think I could have them fanning me with a large palm leaf? I'll be bathing in the sun, drinking orange crush slurpees with voddy and getting tanning oil rubbed all over???  he he he  Wouldn't that just be a hay day!  Hapi weekend

       not 100% today.  Feelin' a bit cheerless.  Boo.    There's a BBQ here at work today.  Free burgers, hot dogs, salads, drinks and chocolate.  There is a table set up outside with freezable beer mugs that have chocolate inside them.  You get to choose one, and if the choco has a golden ticket you get a free ticket to the Bell Gala in Toronto.  Of course, I didn't win.  Free snacks were given out yesterday.  I love this place!  Always something small but free given.    The plan has been set.  This Sunday is the day!  We're going to do the 2.5 hour long-haul to Seattle to hit Forever21.  Maybe even leave Saturday nite so we can enjoy the night life that Americans can offer us Canadian gals.  Yippie!     Things I want to do this summer:  -Hit the Okanagan -Surf in Tofino -Get a wicked tan -Buy an inflatable chair to float in the water -Eat lots of BBQ'd items -Make some new friends -Go somewhere new in BC or even Banff -Buy another bikini and finally look good in it -Buy a CAR or move to a cute place--need convience -Join a Taiko drum class -Improve my time management skills -Increase motivation -Lean how to cook 20 new things -Go to church with my mom on her birthday and mine (She always complains that I don't do this) -Have an awesome birthday bash--1st time my bday falls on a Saturday  Have a hapi day!  I'm sure trying to but I'm just too boo hoo :(

       Welcome to Wednesday afternoon.  @the workplace, not so busy today.  Well, not yet.  I have a ton of stuff to do, that should keep me busy til dinner time.  BUT, I don't even have any food to eat for dinner tonite.  I didn't have any leftovers to take for chow.  BOO..maybe I'll wait 'til i get home at 10pm to grab down.  Went to the opening of Chopsticks (Izakaya) in Yaletown lastnite.  Joanne is working there.  Really nice atmosphere.  The food and drinks kept coming, and it was all FREE!  It was awesome.  Joanne really likes it there.  I'm super happy for her.    Friday, Lucy Mae Brown..lets go!  Horsey is playing there, nice relaxing place.  I'm looking forward to chatting with good friends and have a few bevvies.  Saturday, something is brewing at the Zamora's residence.  Possibly, Mr. VDV Mushroom Movement will be leading that party.  G & I are planning a trip to Seattle to check out Forever 21-hear it is so cheap.  I plan to drop some cash--well actually my credit card and buy..buy and buy!! I love clothes!  I think it'll be a nice drive too.  We'll see, but I am looking forward to the weekend!  Hopefully it'll be bright and sunny!  Wow!  I'm looking at the Forever 21 website..it's soooo cheap.  Who wants to come with us?  Lets just harvest!  I want to stock up on tops and accessories!  I love to shop shop shop.  I just got all my favorite magazines from Japan..JJ, Ray and CanCan.  They're great.  Just jam packed with the latest styles.  I also got a Shiseido face pack!  Sooo cheap there for good products!  I rarely buy that stuff so when I do, I'm happy!  Lately, I've been feeling a bit on the edge.  Getting mad at a certain someone for no reason sometimes.  At times I do think I have the right to be the way I am, but sometimes I think it's my expectation level.  I'm not saying it's too high, but well...I should really just shut up now and hope things workout for me.  Hapi Wednesday!

      i'm having the birthday bubbles.  the antsy pantsy feeling.  excited for p-teezy!  according to the canadian gov't, i'm now the big two.six.  there was an error with my birth certificate.    i'm trying to get off work early today so that maybe i can get my hair done so the colour can run in the canal in penticton.  how i ever so plan my life to not benefit me, long-term wise.   my lunch consists of:  roasted chicken,  BBQ pork and long green beans with tomato in a malaysian curry and coconut sauce.  Yum!  I love South East Asian Cuisine.  Especially, curries with coco milk!  I'm also a fan of Indian food as well.  I love roti and naan bread.  Soooo delicious!  tomorrow i suggested wing and i have lunch at Pandok an Indonesian restaurant on Commercial and 12th.  such good reviews about that place.  i recently visited sala thai on burrard, good prices and tasty food.  i also really like banana leaf.  i've only been to the one on denman once, but it sure was tasty.  the booze is a lil' expensive, but the food is cooked well.  Thai away home is also nice.  it's total fast food thai, but it's cheap and much better than more fast food nation shit.  i just read a review on a place called foofaa thai on cardero...ummm...maybe i'll stroll over there soon.  i love the aroma of South East Asia...am i starting to sound WP?  insense, banana leaf, bamboo, lemon grass and coco milk.  not to mention i added coco milk to the rice in the rice cooker yesterday.  very nice.  once last place i tried a few years ago..typhoon.  food was good.  there are a few places in the main/broadway area that are intersting.  ok, i have lunch in 2 min's.  can't wait.  can't wait for the weekend cuz MC's got room keys so if you wana cum to my hotel....  hapi birthday MC & Brian &amp; Lacey &amp; Josh!!! i love me i love you

      Yet another week begins.&nbsp; A week of hormonal turmoil.&nbsp; Mid-week, Wednesday, my female hormones will start raging in preparation for a montly dismissal commencing next Tuesday.&nbsp; (rag time).&nbsp; Thank goodness it'll be after the Penticton trip!&nbsp; Don't want to miss out on the canal float.&nbsp;   Baked in the sun while working at the Indy on the weekend.&nbsp; Way to hot!&nbsp; Facial skin was peeling yesterday morning!!!! GROSS!&nbsp; I wore tonnes of sunscreen lotion.&nbsp; But the UV was at a high of 9!!&nbsp; 35 degree on Friday.&nbsp; I thought working outdoors on Friday would be a nice vacation out of the office...NO NO NOT at all.&nbsp; Enjoyed a nice yet late dinner at Sala Thai on Friday night.&nbsp; & crashed in bed by 11pm Friday night.&nbsp; Saturday, another Rowing Club party.&nbsp; I really wanted to go to the Commodore...but my luck isn't the greatest.&nbsp; It was ok.&nbsp; I don't get as excited as I used to about Rowing Club parties, but they still are fun.&nbsp; The music was ok.&nbsp; Maybe I won't go for the next while so when I do go again I'll have a blast.&nbsp; Sunday was very chill.&nbsp; Nice to hang out with friends that I haven't seen in awhile.&nbsp; Always a blast to hang out with Eugene and Chris is always super duper funny!&nbsp; Think I haven't seen a lot of my old pals lately.&nbsp; Should maybe invest more time into that.&nbsp;   I'm very irritated with something today.&nbsp; Hopefully time will help this pass or maybe a nap.&nbsp; As for now...compleity is hitting the fan.&nbsp; Maybe it's a bad case of the Monday's.&nbsp; Maybe a nice meal will do me good later.&nbsp;   Hapi Monday!  &nbsp;

      Good start to my morning.&nbsp; Had brekkie with VDV at a Korean cafe on Robson.&nbsp; Good eats.&nbsp; Gots to love those bottomless side dishes.&nbsp; Headed to work after, but couldn't hold myself back from stopping at Aritzia.&nbsp; Spent $188 there on 6 items!!&nbsp; What a deal.&nbsp; A dress I tried on a few months back originally was $75, marked down to $29.99 today!&nbsp; Score!&nbsp; I don't really feel bad since everything was cheap and they are things I would wear.&nbsp; I got a skirt in black.&nbsp; I'm not a big fan of the colour black, so I'm thinking about exchanging it after work today.&nbsp;   My co-worker Phil threw a going-away party for another co-worker Laura lastnite at his place.&nbsp; She's leaving to take on a new job in Toronto as an admin assistant to an executive.&nbsp; Nice lil' dinner:&nbsp; Diana's BBQ chicken breasts, veggies and potatoes.&nbsp; Yum!&nbsp; and BEER...can't forget the beer.&nbsp; Yum!&nbsp; Had Big Rock--Grasshopper.&nbsp; Wheat beer.&nbsp; Very light.&nbsp; Very nice.&nbsp; Had a bit of a stone-up as well, making me a bit cranky on the skytrain home.&nbsp; Boo.  canadiantire.ca--has been my website of choice lately.&nbsp; Been checking it out on a daily for summer fun accessories.&nbsp; Cheap stuff!&nbsp; I'm needing a flotation device for the Penticton trip.&nbsp; We plan to float down the canal.&nbsp; 2 hour trip.&nbsp; We'll have a cooler full of goods too.&nbsp; Should be lots of hot skater boys in board shorts floating away.&nbsp; I'll float next to you boys anytime...stop stop MC.&nbsp;  I've always wanted to live a day,&nbsp;like a rap star.&nbsp; Hot tub, ba a bubba lee...Sittin'&nbsp;in a jacuzzi, sippin' on champange, in a string bikini, listenin' to rap, nodding my head up and down,&nbsp;making out and....&nbsp; That would&nbsp;be fun!&nbsp;   Well, have a great week ya'll.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Co-workers that surround me all have drinkin' prob's.&nbsp; Except for the Chinese clown.&nbsp; Other than him, we've all puked in the bed, banged a random and been naked in an unknown city.&nbsp;   Anyways...moving on.  Speaking of routine.&nbsp; The topic of the week.&nbsp; What I find very "routine"...is when, a person you work with or belong to a community orgranization with or volunteer with or just simply talk to on the bus...speaks of their "sig fig"=girlfriend or boyfriend in every other sentence.&nbsp; But in regards to Wing,&nbsp; I used to live a bit of a routine lifestyle.&nbsp; About 1.5 years ago was working downtown teaching a ESL/TESL program.&nbsp; Regular 830-530 job.&nbsp; Making sweet coin.&nbsp; Worked hard.&nbsp; Not enough breaks.&nbsp; Living with mom's in the burb's.&nbsp; The day started with:&nbsp; Hopping on the community bus at 6:50, same faces.&nbsp; Father and daugher would ride together.&nbsp; Give Father a kiss when getting off at the SFU bus stop.&nbsp; Proceeding to the West Coast Express station, taking the 7:15 train.&nbsp; Seeing other Tri-city folks.&nbsp; Bright.&nbsp; Me trying to complete assignments.&nbsp; The real part of the routine came during the post-work.&nbsp; Used to go to Fitness World and join all the "I'm trying to look good people"&nbsp; in a daily workout.&nbsp; Memorizing step aerobic routines.&nbsp;&nbsp; Making regular gym pals.&nbsp; Returning home, chowing down and in bed before 11pm.&nbsp; BORING...  How much my life has changed since then.&nbsp;   I owe it all to my Global TESOL career.&nbsp; That was the end of the ESL era....  Now, I've become the most free spirited gal ever!&nbsp; This is probably the most relaxed I've ever been my entire life.&nbsp; Working a job that pays...well just enough, doing tonnes of hanging out, lots of drinking and it's great!&nbsp; But not for long tho...  Looking forward to another awesome weekend in the sun.&nbsp; Workin' in the sun at the Indy on Friday and Saturday.&nbsp; Buntzen on Sunday...Best thing is going to Pentiction next Sunday for August long weekend!&nbsp; Yippie right after my bday!&nbsp; Going to Peach Fest!   I'm so excited and I just can't hide it...

      ewww...I feel so gross right now.&nbsp; I brought a lunch today, but got sucked into going to McDonald's for Big Mac McDeal of the day.&nbsp; Along with a McFlurry.&nbsp; LTMY, I feel so gross right now.&nbsp; I so want to throw up, tried in the washroom here at work, nothing came out.&nbsp; BOO!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Story of the day: &nbsp; Went to Shoppers Drug Mart on the way to work.&nbsp; 3ply tissue is on sale for 49 cents.&nbsp; Anyhoo, the line was long.&nbsp; I was next for checkout.&nbsp; A large, fat, and older man was trying to budge and pay for his small purchase consisting of a single Coffee Crisp.&nbsp; Even tho, I'm only buying 1 box of tissue.&nbsp; If you really want&nbsp;to start counting, my purchase is less than his price wise.&nbsp; Whereas, his is smaller physically and life time is probably shorter.&nbsp; Regardless, comparisons don't lead to who gets to go first.&nbsp; Of course, I don't let him go in front of me.&nbsp; I'm in a rush to get to work.&nbsp; The cashier asked him if he was in line first....NO.&nbsp; Calls me a F'in B$%*h.&nbsp; So I say "Get to the back of the line asshole".&nbsp; Worst thing being, he lives in VDV's building.&nbsp; I'm scared of him now.&nbsp; I don't know if I can be seen aroun then.&nbsp; This guy looked like he was going to hit me.&nbsp; Worst thing is...he repeated the "F'in B$%*h" comment to me about 6 times!&nbsp; Loser. &nbsp; Wing and I are thinking about hitting Buntzen Lake this Sunday.&nbsp; Should be nice.&nbsp; I actually want to take a hike around the lake.&nbsp; It takes about 1 hour to do the whole lake.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Jeez,&nbsp; I can't finish this.&nbsp; I need to finish some silly 6 page report on objectives.&nbsp; My review is coming up.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Hapi Hapi

       I enjoyed a lovely weekend again!&nbsp; Good food, booze, friends, BBQ, water and more.    &nbsp;  Welcome to the MC weekend recaptual    &nbsp;  Friday:&nbsp; Wanted to leave work early.&nbsp; Didn't happen.&nbsp; Super sunny weather.&nbsp; Had a nice dinner with le boi.&nbsp; Met Phil at 9pm in Yaletown to start the weekend with a bev...turning into a few.&nbsp; Hung out at a co-workers for a bit, before heading to Celebrities on Davie.&nbsp; Honestly,&nbsp; it didn't have the same "flair" as it used to.&nbsp; It is a lot cleaner inside.&nbsp; Same style as the Plaza and Caprice, but for a club, it's bright.&nbsp; You could see faces clearly.&nbsp; I was hoping for a more metrosexual/urban crowd.&nbsp; The one of 4 years ago.&nbsp; Music was good.&nbsp; Staff were a bit nervy and unsure of the whole club process.&nbsp; Was hammered and back at VDV's by 1:30.&nbsp; To hit the sack to hit Alice Lake....    &nbsp;  Taking us to Sat:&nbsp; What great weather.&nbsp; Had an awesome time.&nbsp; I totally look forward to the weekend if we're going somewhere.&nbsp; BBQ'd all day.&nbsp; Super hot.&nbsp; Got a bit hammered.&nbsp; Felt like fainting at one point.&nbsp; Had to go into the water.&nbsp; About 30 deg's up there.&nbsp; Nice.&nbsp; Quaint.&nbsp; Great place for baptismal ceremonies for Chinese adults.&nbsp; There was a group of bubble tea's dressed in hospital gowns, walking into the water and immersing their bodies into the water.&nbsp; Hoping to be closer to their Holy being.&nbsp; Strumming their guitars, singing "kumbaya"..."one bread, one body" and eating their Asian fave's...but no BBQ.&nbsp; Maybe the smoke burns away the newly cleansed soul.&nbsp; Who knows!&nbsp; Got back to VDV's before 9pm and was out 'til...    &nbsp;  Sunday:&nbsp; I love Sundays with VDV.&nbsp; Woke up at 7.&nbsp; Was at Robson before 10am, strolling the streets like oldies.&nbsp; Hit De Dutch and stuffed le face.&nbsp; Did some shopping.&nbsp; VDV and his Spy sunglasses search, sure drained me.&nbsp; Walked a lot yesterday.&nbsp; Got a bit more tanned.&nbsp; Ended the weekend with a nice meal, nice walk to&nbsp;Coal Harbour (tho it has become a concrete empire...what have they done to nature?) and clean laundry.    &nbsp;  Monday bantar:&nbsp; The condo, real estate craze.&nbsp; What is happening to beautiful Vancouver?&nbsp; Coal Harbour, false creek, Yaletown are crowding with concrete monsters.&nbsp; Just destoying what makes Vancouver sooo beautiful.&nbsp; Condo's are cool, but it's amazing how many people are just super "amazed" by them.&nbsp; Like wow!&nbsp; They're sooo cool.&nbsp; and for some, you can go from zero to hero because you have a condo.&nbsp; Be a not-so-attractive person, move into a 11floor suite and become the ultimate playa.&nbsp; See, I'm a bit of a country/burb/island girl.&nbsp; Born in Saskatchewan, lived in Vancouver for 1 year, moved to PoCo,&nbsp; moved to Vancouver Island and back to PoMo.&nbsp; Daughter of a biologist.&nbsp; So I really enjoy nature.&nbsp; I do like condo's.&nbsp; Wouldn't be nice if there were more room and more trees between them tho?&nbsp; Was walking through Coal Harbour yesterday.&nbsp; Little man made creeks just outside of your condo???&nbsp; WTF!&nbsp; I'd prefer to live in a small-mid sized home, med-sized backyard, some fruit trees,&nbsp;westside would be nice, quiet, green and clean.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  So tired at work today.&nbsp; Can't wait 'til break time!    &nbsp;  Hapi Week Ya'll!    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Just got another e-mail from India.  My best friend Rachel (who I've known since Grade 5) is there right now.  After reading this e-mail, I really really want to go:   Hi everyone, well here it is, my first mass email from a dodgy internet cafe in Varanasi, India.  Dodgy meaning the connection is soooo slow and the power might go out and I won't be able to send it. Oh yeah, and there are a couple of cows and pigs peaking in the doorway.  Oh India! Well, it is certainly an interesting place to start.  Backpacker Rachel has been thoroughly tested the last 10 days. The first 2 days were spent in Delhi with my Cdn buddy Suse. It was a very pleasant start as she has a personal driver and a boy that comes by in the morning to do the laundry and dishes...all things that I had no problem adjusting to!  Her place is great so it was nice touring Delhi and then being able to go back to her haven to relax in the Air Con. (heat is 35-40 degrees). Had a fun night out at a Delhi night club with a couple of her friends.  Suse set off with me and Ben for a 5 day trip and as she is a seasoned traveller, we declared, let't rough it (mum, stop laughing)!  I was up for the challenge although sad to say goodbye driver, goodbye clean clothes... But we spoilt ourselves with an a-c train down to Agra, home of the famous Taj Mahal.  It was amazing, I took lots of pics which will send out later. Our hostel was nice and dodgy with Suse having a room where the air cooler was sparking flames. But there was an awesome view of the Taj from the terrace so who could ask for more. We also met another Canadian girl (Eva)who joined us for a couple of days, so we had our Canadian posse, plus the token Aussie, and the perfect number of people for cards.  After Agra, we set off for the western part of India, Rajasthan, where we saw lots of old palaces and forts. Our first stop Jaipur was a bit too full-on for my liking as the touts (taxi drivers) are very in your face. Next stop Udaipur was excellent- smaller town and we did some yoga (Ben too!) and Suse and I indulged in a facial.  After this, Suse headed back to Delhi for work, Eva went her own way and Ben and I started an intense trek to the Eastern part. This included an unintentional 22 hour straight bus- train trip where we didn't have a meal, and as you can imagine hungry Rachel does not make a good travel partner! So I have definitely had a some frazzled moments. Namely when we have just arrived tired off the train/bus, have 15 rickshaw (3 wheel motorbikes) drivers surround you to get in their taxi, trying to explain that you want to go to the Lonely Planet guest house, not theirs,while all the while avoiding more people, plus cow, goats, pigs and their crap etc. Oh the smells! But I have found the massive highs as well as it is such an fascinating place and the people are very warm and friendly. We are in Varansi now, which is one of the holiest places in India, hindus come here to bathe in the Ganges river.  We walked along the banks today and also found the burning ghat house- where bodies are publicly cremated   And yes, I have managed to get Delhi Belly!!!! I had some very good indian meals but my stomach has not thought as much! Now on a lighter diet, although good continental is hard to find so it is a bit tough...might be the best diet ever? but definitely not the most enjoyable one.   Thanks for the personal emails, I will try and get back to you during my 8 hr stopover in Hong Kong.   Love, Rach   I so want to do some traveling after reading that e-mail.  Jenn is in India too.  I'm jealous.  I really want to go to Goa!  Go Go Goa trance.  I had a nightmare lastnite.  Monsters, snakes and all creepies from Freddy or Nightmare on Elm Street.  Woke up in a full sweat.  Scalp, feet and knees were soaking.  I was so scared I couldn't even go to the washroom.  MC's such a child.    I spent lastnight in P.M.  My Mom wasn't even home, but it was nice to be at home.  Tho I had no computer, no movies, no good food and it was super hot...it was nice to chill.  Painted le tozies.  Look very cute.    Not really sure about today.  I know I want to eat some yummies.  Would really like to hit the pool, but the clouds are crowding.  Maybe a movie would be nice.  Kill Bill 2?  Haven't seen it yet, heard it was good.  I've been thinking a lot about steak since 10am this morning.  On Hastings and Clarke, Brave Bull's House of Steak.  I've heard such great reviews about this place from the 2 boys that sit near me at work.  Run by a couple.  Wife works the floor.  Husband cooks in the back.  $8.95 for high quality prime rib.  They have almost every and any cut of beef in the house.  That surely is a place I would like to visit.  I've seen that place sooo many times and have been curious about it.  Now is the time to go.  If you're in, let me know.    Looks like the weekend plans may have a bit of a change since it may be raining up at Alice Lake.  Plan may change to Chilliwack Lake, Harrison or Mannin Park.  Nice lakes.  Need to dig up the fishing tackle for some off-the-dock catching.  Then pop that puppy on the barbie and finish off with a bit of soy or daikon dip.  Yum!  My co-worker just said "wow, you talk about food all the time"  MC loves food.  BTW, have you ever tried CBC (chicken brocolli cheez)?  Total WP yummy!  Hapi Wednesday!

      I sit next to a Chinese/Honger Cowboy.  Being serious on the job=professionalism.  For this Cowboy, it may just indicate passion for the job.  It's crazy.    In reference to today's blog title.  Friends:  really what are they?  I'm really happy to know that I have an awesome friend that I can relay on for just about anything.  Always willing to partake in any event, free spirited, understanding and patient.  At times, a bit frazzled when loss of items occur.  Most of all, openminded to anything.  Never judges me.  I'm really to have this person in my life.  It's also such a joke when I introduce this person as a "best friend".  Ha ha ha.  We totally take the piss.    I'm really looking forward to mine and B's birthday at the end of the month.  We'll start off on Saturday night at Chopstick's then to Aqua.  Sunday morning, get in the car and hit Penticton at 7am-ish.  I know I'll be totally juiced the night before, but I'm totally used to staying out super late, gettin' messy and wakin' up early in the morning to hit some sunny Britsh Columbia destination.  It should be great!  That's the weekend of Peach Fest.  I've tried to book a hotel and everything is booked.  This time we'll have to stay at a motel.  That's ok, because I got room keys.  We're probably going to do a lot of chillin' and swimmin' at Skaha Lake.  Then in the evening, hit Night Moves, Element or the Blue Mule...then after the bars close...HIT the Peach Fest outdoor rave!!!  Should be a blast.  Almost off work.  Sunny Tuesday!

      Good day ya'll.  It's a sunny Monday.  A bit tired, but had a great weekend again.  The recapual: the ritual of recapping  Friday:  Tokyo Lounge: nuff said.  If you know me, you'll know exactly how I feel about the place.  Saturday:  Mommie's bday.  Total filling of the stomach event.  Whole roasted pig just slapped on the kitchen table, pork on a stick BBQ (marinated with the ever so yummy Filipino sauce--soy, ketchup, garlic, pepper and 7-up), meat, meat and more meat.  VDV and I stacked up to prepare us for a night of dancin'.  Hit the commodore to witness Kaskade and Mark Farina play house music all night long.  Mark Farina's set was a bit hard, but had a great night.  People were great.  Happy Birthday Daniel and Glenn!!  Sunday:  Got home late on Saturday/Sunday morning.  Stayed up for a bit being silly with VDV.  I always have a blast with le boi.  He's sooo funnie.  Woke up around 4pm!!!!  Did some cleaning, watched some movies and BBQ'd on VDV's patio.  We're so not allowed to do that, but steak on the barbie is soooo yum yum!    Recent thoughts:  Debating about going back to school.  What to study?  Not really sure.  Think I'm going to scrap the whole teach and travel idea.  I love teaching, but I really want to get myself stablized.  If I make 1 international trip per year, I'll be satisfied.  Need to save some money.  I really want to travel to India flying through Europe.  I just got another e-mail from Jenn, my girlfriend that I met in Japan.  Below is the e-mail of her travels in India.  Read it, then let me know if you'd like to join me at the end of the year Europe(Spain,Ireland--India--Sri Lanka--Maldives).  Could be great fun!  and think about it, you can't backpack to the small places when you're old.  Jenn's e-mail:   Hello friends and family!!! On the slowest internet connection ever and can therefore only handle one group email to update everyone.  Brent and I are in Shimla now.  We left Rishikesh and headed to Chandigarth.  We took local busses and it was about 2$ for the three bus rides.  Chandigarth is a new city, laid out 50 some-odd years ago by the very famous architect LeCourbousier.  Courbousier is one of those names I remember from my degree in the history of architecture, tragically all I remember is the "Ecole des Belles Arts".  C'est la vie, another case where I wish I had studied harder in Uni. Anyways, the town doesn't have much to offer but it is indeed the cleanest city in which we've been.  We did check out this rock garden though that was absolutely spectacular.  I don't have the photos on disk yet, but will have to forward them so that they scope of this place can be understood... lots of recycled material... rocks (of course) and hundreds, no-thousands, of little people/beings made out of everything from tiles and pots to bangles... there are waterfalls, camels, enormous swings... and young Indian lovers everwhere cuddling in the shadows... you'll need to see the photos.  From Chandigarth we travelled again by bus to where we are now: Shimla.  Shimla is a city that sprawls accross the ridge of this small range of mountain (small-we're at 2205 meters) I LOVE IT!  It's another Indian tourist town, so people from all over India come here to cool down in the summer.  It is cooler and very comfortable.  Unlike Rishikesh and Haridwar, where we have spent the last two weeks, this is not a religoius mecca.  SOoooo, they sell beer!  Haridwar and Rishikesh are "dry."  This town is all hills. You simply could not be fat and get around here, up and down, stairs, hills, stairs... cliffs... HUGE monkeys (of which I am now petrified after watching a friend get bit in Myanmar).. and also, Shimla boast a beautiful Christian Church on the main ridge, famous for some reason which now somehow eludes me.  But the most amazing thing about this town is the panoramic views. WOW.  I think as we travel north (next stop Manali) the views will be even more breathtaking.  So, here we are for a few days at least.  Oh yea-get this, as we are cruising along these amazing cliffs and mountain ranges from Chandigarth to Shimla, Brent and I smell ganja, hmm, that guy is growing more than tomatoes Brent says...  We both look out the window only to focus in on what we are flying by on the side of the road... you guessed it!... enormous patches of wild... WEED. There is a reason why it is called weed.  For the remaining hour Brent and I confused the other bus passengers by our earnest exclamations while staring at the curb, "Look!" "Quick, get the camera"... Sssoooooo ridiculous.  People walking their children to school through it!  In corners of unkempt driveways!  The funny thing is that no one smokes much of it, preferring the black stuff that's made from it.  Just like the GREAT LORD SHIVA.  I like Hinduism.  Anyways, going now to try and find a receipt to send a hotel we stayed at-there is some problem with a box I sent to Canada and it has been returned to where we stayed at in Jaiselmer!  !@#$%^ what a hassel. So, forgive me again for the generic email.  Don't send me any forwards, my inbox cannot handle it-thanks, love you (all), Jennifer   NOT enought inspiration for you to join me???  Let me know, and I will entice you with photos of my travels.  Hapi Monday!  BTW, VDV is great!

      or to challenge.    Hapi Thursday.    To do list: 1.  Fill these nails.  Overdue and ugly! 2.  Buy Mother a birthday present.  She's so hard to shop for.  Hard to please.  Has everything she needs.   3.  Get looking for an evening ESL job.  MC needs more cash and Bell Mobility just isn't cuttin' it.   4.  Find a pair of shoes that I can wear to work with a small heel but comfy is the main issue. 5.  Get my hair coloured.  Roots are ugly!  Misako's here I come!  Poundering thoughts: MC is in a state of confusion.  On one hand, I love teaching and traveling.  I really enjoy learning a new language and culture.  Mostly, I love the travel rush.  Especially right before arriving in a new city.  My heart raises.  It feels so good.  When I left for Japan, the minute the plane took off I thought..."Wow!  I'm so happy I'm getting the hell outta here".  It's awesome meeting new people.  Going to new places.    On the other hand,  sense of responsiblity and maturity.  Turning 26 this year.  No stable career.  No fullfilling educational background.  Not a huge amount of savings in the bank.  Too much Filipino/Asian parents pressure.  I feel like I need to go back to school or get established in a "Long-term" career.    Arggg...I really don't know.  Maybe I just need sometime to do some research.  Figure out what's best.  Either jump on a plane to teach or jump provinces to enroll in more, boring post-secondary money sucking education.  However,  at the moment I know that a career in Public Relations interests me.    Enuff of that.  Weekend discussion.  Friday, nothing much planned.  Maybe stop by Tokyo Lounge for a bev or 2.  Say hi to some peeps.  Who knows how that should end.  Ideally, I would like to have a quiet dinner, watch a movie, have some drinks, get a lil' tipsy and hit the sack before 3.  Saturday, Mommy's bday.  See her in the afternoon.  Give her the present.  Be all happy.  Play with baby Chelsea for a bit.  Maybe break out the baby pool in the backyard.  Then get me done and out for Kaskade and Mark Farina.  Yippie!   Should be good times.  I've seen both of them play many times before, but good times.  Hopefully the crowd will be NOT be full of the: chach, photo posing and lack of intellectual/individual thought.    Only 2 hours left 'til work is done.  Done like dinner.  What's for dinner tonite?

      Winger:  I'm sorry I'm tickle to the tinkle.  I do get carried away with my jokes=embrassed Wing, but it's only because I think you're great!  Otherwise, I would pay no attention to you at all and roll my eyes everytime you spoke.  Wing is the best!  Spent a good 30min's at Metrotown lastnite.  VDV and I thought it would be a great way to pass the time.  Haters r us for sure.  I prefer shopping on Robson or 4th.  Get fresh air.  Not the typical flip-chick mall rat.  Like that is so Station Square, Grade 9, baggy jeans and stipped body suit.  Then VDV and I stuffed out faces with cheap Chinese food and watched 25% of Happiness (one of my faves).  I went to PoMo lastnite and the things that I found in my closet!  Some shoes that I bouhgt last year around my bday.  Beige and pink pointy ones, white pumps and a demin and teal pair.  Super funky ones!  I don't spend a lot of time at home and a lot of my clothes have been transported to Comox Street.  I'm happy!  I have more clothes to work with.    I have nothing else decent to say.  So Hapi Day!

      The recap:  A bit of a MC over-the-top episode on Friday night.  Not eating the whole day could lead to extreme crankyness.  Possible lashing out on boyfriend.  But boys do need to realize that they aren't the only one in a relationship.  This can be hard for a boy that has spent the majority of his adult life as a bachelor.  Regardless, simple foods at Cactus Club accompanied with bevvie's like a Keith's, voder and Dr.Pepper can put a good end to a night.  Then curling up in a cozy bed just before 2am is always nice on a weekend.    Rise and shine shortly after 12 is always nice on a bright and sunny Saturday.  Venturing to Safeway, purchasing some not-so-fresh "wild" Atlantic Salmon can result in an allergic reaction.  Itchy throat and shortness of breath.  Boo.  Suffered for a good hour.  Lucky VDV was feed a good meal.  Boy likes pasta.  I like seafood.  The combination was culinary.  The only thing about preparing meals for boys is that...they don't give nough feedback.  Like c'mon!  Make sure it's a positive comment or state your "dislike" in a constructive way.  Recently, I was told "it was ok, but it was kind of lacking"...excuse me!  LACKING, is a very poor choice of words to be used when describing something to a Trucka who can tend to be sensitive.  We filled out bellies and enjoyed the rest of the evening with awesome company.  Enjoyed the sunset on the boathouse patio.  Started with a Keith's, moved into some Caesar's then of course back to the voddies.  Ended our night at Aqua: full of "Hi, I'm hot but I'm not", "Hi, I'm a chach" and "Hi, like look at me, I'm cool" people...Ewww....!!!  Yuk.  But the music it was awesome!  I spent the rest of the night, early morning, afternoon and evening with the lovely VDV.  He's great.  I think it embrasses him when I say in public "VDV is great".  But boy should be happy...whatever! Boys will always be dumb!  Congrats to Wing to her new "confession"...he he he.    All I have to say, I'm glad that I don't attend Sonic Saturdays.  Like, lets just go so maybe we can get our picture on the xtscene.com website.  Don't forget to tilt your head to the side and don't smile.  You never know, you may just get noticed and end up on the silly show "Americas top model".  Some shit like that.  Sorry, I'm just a reality show hater.  Honestly, I'm not a big fan of TV.  My parents never found it to be educational.  Math and reading exercises were the name of the game.  I do enjoy watching a bit of TV when I get the chance.  News, FoodNetwork and Buffy (I know it's a silly vampire drama) is all I can do.  Getting back on Track, I did attend 1 session of Silly Sonic awhile back.  Apparently, someone got stabbed outside and I had no idea.  I even walked by the person that got stabbed, but I was outta it, I didn't notice.  Sunday ended with a can of tomato soup.  Only shallots, spices and cream was added.  Extra foods put the majority of veggies at 9.  Why?  Hit the sack at 12 but couldn't sleep 'til 1 because of a rodent that likes to disturb MC.  Then rise and shine again to some construction workers that need to "prepare" for the window change.  What does this preparation include?  NOTHING!  VDV and I are trying to bare with the "living in a fish bowl" problem.  SUCKS!  This weekend is my mom's birthday and Glenn's too.  I'm really excited to see Mark Farina and Kaskade perform at the Commodore!  This should be a great event.  I really enjoy their music.  I really hope Daniel goes too.  It's his bday weekend too.  I love hanging out with him and girlfriend.  Too bad Wing can't go.  Seems like it will be a couple event.  Me, VDV, Glenn, Bimbo, Daniel and GF.  I'm ready to shake my ass.  The commodore is such a great place too.  Will have to pick up tix soon!  Speaking of mommy.  Will be going home to "visit" today.  Maybe pick up a movie and watch it with her.  She hasn't seen Mystic River yet.  Whatever it takes to keep the mommy happy.  She probably thinks I'm not going to remember her birthday either.  So I was thinking about having a lil' shin-dig at home on Saturday afternoon and inviting some of her friends over.  I should check the weather, and maybe we can bring out the BBQ.    Overall, I've been pretty happy lately.  Weather has been nice.  Things with VDV and I are better than ever.  Work is good.  Have awesome friends.  But not so happy with my warerobe.  Need to hit Forever21 asap.  Hapi Lovely Day All!

      is how i feel.  My body structure feels like it's 90!  After a great day at Cultus Lake on Canada's 137th birthday, pain like this is worth it.  Bathing in the sun, BBQ'in some weinnies, swimmin' around and crying because VDV is going too fast on the SeaDoo.  Not to mention Wing's lil' tears.  Possible effects from da bombers.  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the day of doing the **face** with Wing after boyfriend comments/behavior.  I love sunscree.    This weekend calls for some relaxation.  Maybe view a few flicks, eat some foodie goodie and SLEEP!    Think I'll watch the Mosquito Coast tonite.  Co-worker let me borrow it.  Ta Ta for now Princes and Princesses
