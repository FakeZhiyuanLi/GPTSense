        Mystical Slumber  Calling out for you,  But you're not there.  I need you...  Don't you care?  I need to know.  Cause you're not answering...  I need to go...  Please tell me...  And let me know,  Does our love last an eternity?  Or is it going to fade...  Into unknown territory,  And our love - unmade.  Please, I'm going...  Into a mystic slumber...  And I'm praying...  With all my heart...  You care and will come,  Don't make our love a dart,  In which you peg and mercilessly,  Kill me.  And set me free.  I need to go...  I'm falling asleep..  Please, let me know.  My love, are you there?  Don't you care?  A Mystic Slumber.

        My Love, The Wind  My love, can't you feel this wind?  It blows ever so strong,  Whirling around and around...  Make it stop, my head is spinning,  My love, don't you care?  Make it stop.  The wind,  Blowing to an unknown destiny.  Does it know?  Does it care?  My love, please make it stop.  My love...  The wind!  Raging through trees and tunnels,  Gusting small animals about,  Wafting the hay off their piles...  Those men with their pitchforks,  My love,  Can you not see them?  Raising their hands, clenched in a fist,  Cursing the wind?  Can you not see the anger in their eyes?  Can you not see the secret sparks in their eyes?  As if it were cursing and laughing at the same time?  My love,  Do you not see and feel the joy of the wind?  And its mischievousness?  My love,  Can you not compare the wind to a child?  Laughing, playing and causing trouble?  Does it ever stop laughing so?  My love!  The tinkling in the wind!  The soft bells,  Ringing and tinkling?  In the wind!  It is laughing at us!  It makes my heart feel light again.  I do not have the worries anymore.  My heart is like a childs.  It does not have the same uncertanties anymore.  The wind is a wonderous peice of music of Mother Nature's.  Oh, if only everyone took the time to listen to Mother Nature's Masterpeice,  My love,  It is wonderful,  The wind.

        Light & Dark  A light without a shadow,  Is a world without meaning.  In every light,  There must be a shadow.  After everyday,  The night must come.  But as the night comes,  You know,  A day is sure to follow.  After the shadow is cast,  You know,  A light is somewhere up ahead.  When darkness is around,  A light must be near to cast it.  Light and dark; Sisters; Brothers; Lovers; Haters. They are togther.  They are forever.  They simply are.  And no reason to explain.  They simply are.  Light and dark.  An endless bond,  Between two great forces,  One good,  The other evil.  But they simply are,  Light and dark.  Together.  Forever.
