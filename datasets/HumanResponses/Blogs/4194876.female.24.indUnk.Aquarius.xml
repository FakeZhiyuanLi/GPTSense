        24 and jaded could be a problem in the dating department but considering my track record with boyfriends I should probably hold off on dating for a while.....and why is it that everytime I meet someone I'm into the ex-boyfriends suddenly re-appear to see "how I'm doing"........For future reference (because I will not use anyone's real name) below is the breakdown of the ex files:           The Non : Model/Actor who I dated in high school (prom, senior year) who became friend w/benefits throughout college and in between boyfriends who moved to LA to become a star. Broke my heart once, hope I broke his more! Breathtakingly pretty, agreed upon by both men and woman alike at a work function, but he was and is such a "himbo".           CRAZY : The Non's best friend from college whom he introduced me too right after I was dumped via aim by MP (Multiple Personality mentioned in earlier post). Summer Fling/Rebound so not really an ex-bf I guess who read my journal and sniffed my hair during a late night cab ride while I was wedged btwn him and The Non (at this point The Non and I were "on" in regards to the benefits) very uncomfortable situation. Just the name says it all, oh yeah and reading my journal is a big indication as well.           MP (a.k.a. Multiple Personality) : Son of a Senator, Oldest child of Six, a big baby who's apparently so smart that in college they made him take therapy sessions so that he didn't become bored with life.......too late he already is. A Gemini who fits the profile to the T. Always wishy washy, always out to benefit himself no matter who he uses, and damn if he wasn't so goodlooking and built with amazing green eyes I would have never stayed with him for three years......too bad he's nuts (just found out from his old roommates that he used to cry himself to sleep at night) Explains the apology a year after the fact......           Boulder Head : Basketball Player, D1 in college, professionally over seas, now maybe in NJ this fall.......volatile relationship.....put it to you this way, after asking him if he was cheating, his response "Just because I let some girl suck my dick doesn't mean she means something to me, its not like I have sex with them" and he still to this day (we speak frequently) doesn't understand why I have refused his proposals and don't want to have his out of wedlock kids. But, now he's found God so maybe he has potential....hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahhaha           RoadRunner : The One That Got Away......well, my rooommate says I'm the one that got away but he was amazing. We still speak and I don't think that there is an end to this just yet.....only time will tell, and timing was the only thing that screwed this one.......such a sweetheart, the only ex I don't mind calling me.          Its nice, I think, to be able to keep in touch, but for some reason the above, excluding roadrunner, think after three years or so of not dating they can just pick up a phone and voila, maybe we will pick up where things left off....no, no, no, no,no, no,no!!!!!          Leave me along so I can creat a new list of ex-losers, because this one is getting old already!

         So, last Friday seems to be the beginning of the end for me literally. Getting ready for work at 7am I happen to shut my bedroom door only to hear "CRASH, CRACK, SNAP!", yes friends and foes (those who will enjoy this story no less) that was the sound of my bedroom mirror crashing to the floor and breaking into a thousand pieces. Needless to say, seven years of bad luck is not what I need at this point and time in my life. After having my heart broken in about the same manner a week prior to this I was sure nothing worse could happen. Well, considering I was stuck with the guy for two days after crying my eyes out and then catching poison ivy maybe this will seem like cake.              WRONG!!!              As I explain to my roommate, the Kentucky Wonder whom I like to call minnow (in relation to my training her re: men in regards to the famous nickname baby shark given to me by some D1 male athletes for my once famous player ways, those days have long past) that now I am going to have seven years bad luck she tells me pish posh move on. So, I figure ok, make some breakfast and things will be fine .....no, again. As I'm making my egg whites, the sleeve of my bathrobe catches on fire. Sure sign at this point I'm pretty much going to die. I manage to stop the flames and proceed to get my frazzled ass in gear for work........ugh!              Get to work and my ex-boyfriend, we'll call him MP (for Multiple Personality), a man, I mean little boy with emotional problems, that had dumped me a year earlier after returning from Paradise (Barbados) on instant messenger, writes to me to say that He's sorry and would like to call me to discuss......WTF! Yeah, ok...because obviously I must be sitting here thinking of you after over a year...nooooooooooooooooo. I've been through at least 50 dates plus since and one guy I truly liked since the fact.....I've moved on and you should too!               So in one day, I broke a mirror (causing the bad luck), caught on fire, and was apologized to by the most irrational person on earth.....so just when I think its all said and done MP's best friend calls me Sunday night to ask me out on a date (we'll call him Social Climber, because he promotes and thinks he's "big time"). How about NO!              So Monday rolls around and I'm walking to work. It was nice outside, the air was good, the sun was shining, the usual Queens Greeks were drinking their cappuccinos and smoking bad home made cigarettes at the corner cafe and a man was outside doing his morning jog, or so I thought...as I'm walking up the subway steps to get to work he runs up the stairs behind me and grabs my ass....not a little pinch either a full on up the butt, in the crack, grab the whole cheek type of grab..........as I turn around to beat him with my purse (as any normal nyc woman would respond) he runs down the steps but stops to pull down his pants and flash me........oh happy monday to all!!!!!              Also, the man of my dreams, who didn't mean to break my heart has called me twice (because we have decided to stay friends) and both times I've missed the call in a matter of a minute. Oh the heartbreak :(              Here's to praying for the seven years to maybe be cut down to three or four........
