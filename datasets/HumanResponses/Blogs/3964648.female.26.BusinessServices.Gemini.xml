       Who typically hires Virtual Employees?    Small businesses or individuals that don't have the space for an assistant but need the staff support for the daily duties required to run a business. Some examples are Desktop Publishing, Database Design, Graphic Design, Accounting, Data Entry, and Dictation. Virtual employees are a cost effective way to get work done.   Why hire a Virtual Assistant?   Savings to companies by eliminating overheard with no employee costs, including insurance savings, taxes (no FICA, social security, federal or state taxes) no workman's comp. No extra office space or equipment. You pay only for the time needed for any particular project.  So, whether it is hiring Virtual employees for administrative work or more complicated tasks, virtual employees are the wave of the near future.   Please comment on your thoughts as to if you are using a virtual employee and how that is going for you.

      In recent experience, I have learned that Networking is a fine art that needs to be mastered, and done so carefully.   I went to a networking event (location to be disclosed, because other than this person, it was great) today, and was mingling and socializing before the event actually got started.&nbsp; A woman came up to me and introduced herself, and before I could introduce myself she started to comment on my dress, my hair, my season (whatever that means), and then handed me her card, and said to call her for a free consultation and walked away.&nbsp;   This was the most horrific experience in networking I have ever had happen to me.&nbsp;   A wise entrepreneur once told me how to network effectively and get the biggest bang for the short time that I get with a potential client.&nbsp; I am going to list a few points, feel free to respond and add some points of your own.     Shake hands and make eye contact when you meet a person.&nbsp; I know this sounds trivial, but you don't know how many people either don't shake hands or look at the floor when you introduce yourself.  Ask the person you meet about them and their business.&nbsp; It is a great ice-breaker, and people are always happy to talk about themselves before they will be happy to listen to you and your business.&nbsp; Remember that people only refer&nbsp;and give business to those whom they trust.  Follow-up.&nbsp; If you tell the person you met that you will call them to meet for coffee, then do that, and do that within 24 hours.&nbsp; Also, follow-up with people you meet either via e-mail, or a nice letter in the mail.&nbsp; Either way, you are reminding them of who you are and what you do will help when you follow-up with a phone call later.   The bottom line is network smarter, not harder.&nbsp; You can and should network everywhere and anywhere.&nbsp; Always have business cards on you and utilize them.

              What is a Virtual Assistant (VA)?    " Virtual Assistants''  are independent contractors who provide administrative support or specialized business services from a distance, through the Internet, fax, telephone or another method of communication. They can help a company that needs extra people to meet seasonal demands; provide unique skills for a special project; or step in to meet the demands of business growth, locally, domestically or globally."   (  urlLink  www.ivaa.org   )      &nbsp;   With that being said,  Virtual Assistants'  clients tend to be self-employed entrepreneurs, and small to mid-sized businesses. Businesses without regular staff are some of my best clients. I have numerous consultants as clients. These one-person businesses are excellent prospects. It's difficult for them to focus on their core business tasks as well as maintain the daily chores required.   &nbsp;     What Exactly Does a Virtual Assistant Do?

      I don't know about you, but the rain motivates me, more than the nice weather does.&nbsp;   On a day like today (rainy and cool in Cleveland), I get in gear to cook, clean, and most of all get down to business.&nbsp;   It seems that the weather warrants me to stay inside, and make a dozen phone calls, return all those e-mails from Thursday and Friday,&nbsp;make a nice cup of coffee and concentrate, really concentrate on my&nbsp;business ideas and future plans.  What is it&nbsp;that others do on a day like this, is&nbsp;it easier to work, or harder to work?  I hope&nbsp;your day is as good as mine looks&nbsp;to be. &nbsp;

      Okay, I am entering into a zone at the moment, a very tired zone.&nbsp; I can't seem to keep my eyes open, and it is only 11:30 am.&nbsp;   My blog events and links are updated, should you want to see something up there, please e-mail me, and let me know, I will be happy to put it up there.   If anyone can tell me how NOT to have a bullet point for each line in the events, please let me know.   On another note, yesterday was both a happy and a sad day for me.&nbsp;   I lost a long standing client for a silly reason, that I had absolutely nothing to do with, but hey, everyone says, you loose one, and gain two, so pray that my networking today and tonight does some good for me.   It was a happy day, as I went networking, and boy was that fun, I was able to meet a lot of new people and rekindle some friendships, I let fall by the wayside a little bit.&nbsp; It was great to get out and socialize and hear about others businesses.   I hope that all of you are having a great day.

      and I am up blogging, hmmm what is wrong with this picture.  I went to a networking event tonight,  Passport Professionals Networking,  and I must say, it was a small, yet interesting group of people.  I saw a few folks I knew (what a surprise, as I seem to do that a lot lately) and I met a few more new people, however I know that out of everyone I met and exchanged cards with, not a single one of them would&nbsp;be a good client for me.&nbsp; So, so I get discouraged and not attend these events anymore, or do I keep going and build relationships and hope for referrals?&nbsp; I am not sure what side to take, if there really is a side to take.&nbsp;  I love people, talking to them, e-mailing them, etc, and the last thing I want to do is pull myself out of a scene where I am establishing a name for myself and I really don't want to have to do that all over again anytime soon.  What are your thoughts, have you ever  dropped out of a scene,  just to have to  get back in?&nbsp;   Did it do you any harm, any good? Would you do it again?  Thanks all - and good night!

      In speaking with some colleagues of mine, today I found out how you can loose a client in    less than 10 minutes   , after working so hard to gain them as your client, it is because of a delay in calling back.  &nbsp; I always thought that    24-48 hours    was enough time to contact someone back, however I was wrong.&nbsp; Phone calls should be made immediately - and really by immediately, it calls for within    1-2 hours    of the initial call. &nbsp; I always thought I was providing good customer service to my clients by responding the same day...now I have a   new   outlook on things.

      My five year old daughter called me this afternoon (if you don't know me to well, she is in TN visiting her father) and wanted to ask me a question.    I told her, as I always have, she can ask me anything.  So, she did.  She wanted to know why mommy and daddy don't live togeather anymore, and why can't we all get along.  I started thinking about this, and I wondered why can't we get along?  Better yet, why is it that we all can't get along.  Everyone is equal, so why not?   Any thoughts or comments...are always appreciated.

      It is time for another week of virtual assisting in my world, which means I get to sit at home in my pj's and bunny slippers and work. &nbsp; I had a friend ask me last evening what the point was of working at home, with the rising cost of insurance, the purchasing of all my own software and hardware, the cost of supplies and lastly the cost of networking. &nbsp; I told her this, and I invite you to comment as well..... &nbsp; I said, it is very worthwhile to work from home, not only do I get started and finish my day when I want, but I get to go at my own pace, I don't set unrealistic goals for myself, and I am honest and forthright about my business and what I can and can't do. &nbsp; Being virtual means many things to many people, please share your thoughts....

      so, I haven't posted as often the last few days.  I visited Cool Cleveland- The Source for News &amp; Events in Cleveland, Ohio website today, and I noticed this posting about a website that is being created by partnerships in the Cleveland/Akron area.     NEO411.biz for entrepreneurs We've been talking about changing the atmosphere around here to be more welcoming to entrepreneurs, so it's nice to see someone doing something about it. NEO411.biz was formed to give entrepreneurs, startups and small businesses access to resources in our fantastic region. Consisting of a partnership between groups like COSE, the Greater Akron Chamber of Commerce, CAMP, GlIDE, JumpStart, NEOSA and others, NEO411.biz offers operations consulting, business planning, group benefits and other services to help entrepreneurs in the 13-county region go from concept to prototype, to production to funding, all right here in Northeast Ohio.  urlLink info@neo411.biz  800-505-4811  urlLink http://www.neo411.biz/      I have visited this site a few times, since first hearing about it a few months back at the eWomen's Networking Event I attended. I am not sure what to think of it, and  I invite you to respond as to your thoughts on this site, and if you see as much room for improvement as others have.
