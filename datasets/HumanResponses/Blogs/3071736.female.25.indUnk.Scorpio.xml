      Today's Topic of the World...The Internet   The internet is by far the most amazing invention created so far.  Think about it...billions or maybe even trillions of pieces of information literally at your fingertips!  You can complete your entire family tree, do your taxes in your jammies, discover new people, culture's and worlds....and what are you doing with it?  You're reading the random blog of a woman you've never even met and probably won't.     How does it happen?  How do you log in to check your e-mail and wind up riveted to a trivia page that's enlightening you to the history of carrots?  And what is it that makes random silliness on the net so fascinating?  I mean think about it..you don't go to the library for a book on the history of theatre and find yourself absorbed in a book about the mating habits of baboons, do you?  And how is it that with so much relevant, enlightening information, the sites with names like "TotallyUseless.com" and "Uselesstimewastinginfo.com" get more hits?    And why am I still sitting here, typing in this random blog that I found on accident when the original reason I got online was to do research for an article on the uses of used chewing gum?   Until next time this is Miss Snotty Wafflefanny saying...may your computer crash before you're done reading this sente...

      Today's Topic of the World: Pets, New and Old  We brought home our newest family member two days ago.  Apen* is a beautiful Siberian Husky, 40 full pounds of people-loving, playful, "the world is my bathroom", doggie affection.  Aspen didn't come complete with a set of known commands, but in his infinite Doggie Wisdom, he has learned several in the past two days alone!  For example: "SIT!"  = Hike a leg "STAY!" = Sniff around and hike a leg "LAY DOWN!" = Wag tail, hike a leg and actually go pee "Aspen, I said SIT!" = Take off at top speed after a Dangerous Object, such as a rock    Our furry feline Alastair* is not pleased with this new development.  Apart from being rudely awakened to the fact that his two owners do not, in fact, exist solely to worship him, he's also been awakened to the fact that his signature "mess with me and you'll get a paw up your keister" hiss isn't effective on everyone.   Particularly not on Aspen.  He thinks the hiss means hunch down on all fours and play "who can sniff who's nether regions the most"  The few times our formerly loveable cat has emerged from underneath the sofa in the last two days his sole missions have been 1) to make it to his food dish before he gets hit with a nose in his less than desirable areas and 2) to give us, his loving owners, The Paw.   We took Aspen to a mountain park yesterday for a leisurely stroll on a sunlit trail.  We soon found that Aspen's idea of a "leisurely hike" is to make his handlers stand stock still for twenty minutes while he makes it his personal business to sniff out and pee on every single tree in the forest.  In half an hour, I believe we made it about a fourth of a mile up the trail.  I'll tell you what though, our leisurely hike sure did give us a workout...our arms are still sore as I type this.  It turns out that Aspen's main usefulness, apart from looking studly, is as a workout buddy.  Since we live in a fairly small apartment (read: shoebox) he must be exercised regularly.  We are still in negotiations as to who walks whom.  That reminds me....he's due now.   *Names have been changed to protect the innocent...after all, THEY didn't ask to be saddled with names like that...they'd be the laughing stock of the local fire hydrant

      Today's Topic of the World:  Cell Phones--What's The Big Deal?   Cell phones.  Are they a status symbol?  I ask because I have yet to hear the musical notes of one ringing out in public in advertisement of their owners blatant lack of taste in music without seeing the owner make a big show of pulling it out, trilling "HELLO?" and peeking around to see that everyone within hearing distance is noticing.     My theory is that having this cell phone, and even better, actually having to use it, is a direct indication that the user is officially "cool".   I have yet to walk through a mall, grocery store, or any other public venue without seeing a member of the International Cool People Who Carry Cell Phones Society who isn't staring at me and then at his/her cell phone (much like a new mother does to everyone when she takes her babyout in public) as though I'm supposed to congratulate them.  What strikes me as even more hilarious, however is the pointed looks I get when they look me up and down in disgust upon realizing that I am not carrying one.  Obviously, I'm a card-carrying member of the Society for the Promotion of Pocket Protectors.     My question is this...how can something that lowers your IQ so much still make you so cool?  I assume the lowering of the IQ is the direct result of cell phone use for several reasons.  For one, just look at the roads.  On any given day, I will see forty or fifty well-dressed, distinguished persons driving ritzy "look at me everybody I have money!" cars, which you do not get with substandard intelligence cutting off other cars, running red lights and in general looking like their car is having a major seizure.  What do they all have common?  They are yaking into their cell phones.  For two, I have actually witnessed people walk directly into doors that they are looking right at while yakking on cell phones.  For three, people make the silly mistake of suddenly assuming that the entire world is interested in their personal lives.  They actually think the "shut up or get a phone in your keister" look from other public patrons means "please shout louder, we didn't catch the part about you and Bobby in the bed of his Ford Ranger and how now you might be pregnant and boy won't that screw up your chances with Lance the Love Machine."     Nope, I think I'm going to stick to my good old land line.  And I will continue to shout at the bozo who was so involved in his cell phone conversation that he just cut off me and two other lanes of traffic....but boy did he look cool doing it.

      Muggle Support    I can't tell you how many times I've been hounded for the simple fact that I, Miss Snotty Wafflefanny, am a Harry Potter addict.  You may be asking yourself just how old Miss Snotty Wafflefanny is...ten?  Twelve, perhaps?  Or maybe she's a total fogey of as old as fifteen!  Well in a word, NO.  I am twenty-five years old.  Yup, you read it right...I am old enough to vote, drink, and give the finger to the idiot in the car that just cut me off on the freeway because he's yapping on his cell phone and gazing around to make sure everyone else is  aware of what a hunka hunka burnin' masculinity he is. thanks to the status symbol threatening to permanently meld itself into the side of his head.  But I digress.   I'm not the only fan above consenting age, either.  I have a coworker of the same age who is making big plans with me for the debut of the upcoming Potter film.  I also have two aunts who are fans, but as the unveiling of their respective ages would almost certainly result in my untimely death, you'll just have to take my word for it...they are well above the perceived "appropriate" age for Pottermania.       I know we can't be the only four adult fans in the world...so if those of you who are over eighteen and a bonefied wizard wannabe would kindly write in to reassure me on that fact, I'd greatly appreciate it.  And rest-assured, I will forget your name as quickly as I'll read it, so you closet fans needn't worry...your "hep cat" status will remain intact.  (yes, I really am only 25...I ripped that term off of a genuine fogey)    Now, what is a Potter addict?  Well, in my case it's someone who owns all five books, both movies, and at least one other piece of memorabilia.  The ability to toss around terms such as "muggle" "wingardium leviosa" and to define "fizzing whizbee" is also essential.  My memorabilia is a framed poster from the first movie (the fact that I actually had it framed should tell you something) and a photograph of Chris Rankin with his genuine autograph on it, imported all the way from England.  If you don't know which character he plays, you aren't fit to read my blog!   I'm perfectly certain that my coworker and aunts have memorabilia of their own, but as they are too chicken to reveal the exact contents of their Potter Portfolios, one can only speculate.  (I'm relatively certain at least one aunt posseses a wand...and may believe it's real....but that's a whole 'nother support group.....)    So what is an adult Potter fan to do?  As I see it, we have three options:   1) Donate all memorabilia, books, movies, etc. and turn our focus to acceptable adult activities and entertainment  2) Join the younger fans in celebration of one of the most beloved books of all time and respond to the sneers of the "oh so mature" naysayers by blowing raspberries and making pig noses at them 3) Take your books back into hiding and practice your memory charms in case anyone finds you out.   Personally, I'm going with option two.  If any of you see it fit to choose one of the others, well.......keep it to yourselves...I've got my wand at the ready....
