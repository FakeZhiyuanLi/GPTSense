      Matthew proposed to me May 25th, 2004.  It was awesome!!!  Everything I ever hoped it would be!  We were in Montauk staying at his time-share at Gurney's Inn.  It was my first time there...  I loved it!  Only, the weather hadn't been so great so we weren't spending much time on the beach as we hoped we would.  It turns out that the beach was where Matthew initially intended on proposing...    Instead, on our third night there he proposed in our room.  We just got done watching 50 First Dates..  The movie was very sweet.  I got all teary at the end.  I guess it was sweet enough that it inspired Matthew to propose.  So after the movie, I started getting ready for bed.  Matthew called me over to the window where we could see the beautiful ocean.  He told me to stay right there.  Which made me raise and eyebrow.  Even though I didn't  know  what he was about to do, I kinda felt it...    Then I heard the little  beep, beep, beep  from the safe and I got a little choked up...  I could see his reflection in the window and when he got about half way over I turned around.    I knew exactly what he was going to do by the look on his face.  My breathing got a little quick and I thought I was going to evaporate right into thin air.  He knelt down and his eyes welled up.  So did mine.  I never expected to be such a mess.  He became kinda a mess too.  I was laughing, crying, hyperventalating...  Man, it was probably the most emotional day of my life so far!!  finally I caught my breath and could actually tell Matthew how happy I was and, "YES, YES, YES!"  At this time I hadn't even looked at the ring...  So I did.  And there I went with all the crying and fast breathing again.  Haha.  The ring took my breath away!  It's B-E-A-U-TI-FUL!!!  And that was that..  I'd do it all over, and over, and over, and over if I could!!

       urlLink    Detail of Humor Path &nbsp; The physiological study of laughter has its own name -- gelotology. And we know that certain parts of the brain are responsible for certain human functions. For example, emotional responses are the function of the brain's largest region, the frontal lobe. But  urlLink researchers  have learned that the production of  laughter  is involved with various regions of the brain. While the relationship between laughter and the brain is not fully understood, researchers are making some progress.   For example, Derks traced the pattern of brainwave activity in subjects responding to humorous material. Subjects were hooked up to an electroencephalograph (EEG) and their brain activity was measured when they laughed. In each case, the brain produced a regular electrical pattern. Within four-tenths of a second of exposure to something potentially funny, an electrical wave moved through the cerebral cortex, the largest part of the brain. If the wave took a negative charge, laughter resulted. If it maintained a positive charge, no response was given, researchers said.   During the experiment, researchers observed the following specific activities:    The left side of the cortex (the layer of cells that covers the entire surface of the forebrain) analyzed the words and structure of the joke.&nbsp;  The brain's large frontal lobe, which is involved in social emotional responses, became very active.   The right hemisphere of the cortex carried out the intellectual analysis required to "get" the joke.   Brainwave activity then spread to the sensory processing area of the occipital lobe (the area on the back of the head that contains the cells that process visual signals).   Stimulation of the motor sections evoked physical responses to the joke.    This is different from what happens with emotional responses. Emotional responses appear to be confined to specific areas of the brain, while laughter seems to be produced via a circuit that runs through many regions of the brain.   (This means that damage to any of these regions can impair one's sense of humor and response to humor, experts say.)  &nbsp;  urlLink ^
