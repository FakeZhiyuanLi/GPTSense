      I always feel like I never accomplish anything on the weekends.  This holiday weekend was no different.  I went out with my friends to dinner at the Black Pearl (Chinese food) and Fado's (Irish Pub) on Friday night.  We went to see a movie (Raising Helen 2.5/4), then later Chopstix (dueling piano bar) and Ozzie's (karaoke bar).  I ran some errands and grocery shopped on Sunday.  Rented Win a Date with Tad Hamilton (1.5/4) and started knitting a baby blanket for a friend who is due in September.  I have 3 months to finish it and I think I will need all of that time seeing how slow it is taking me.  I started knitting last fall so I wouldn't feel so unproductive while watching TV.  It has proved to be quite useful, I've already finished two baby blankets (one for my cousin and one for my boss) and a few scarves.

      So my Mom called me today and wanted me to get my brother to get a graduate degree or get a good job. Like he would ever listen to me? My brother is a year older and has bossed me around since I was a kid. Now that we are older, we get along a bit better but he won't listen to me. He doesn't like his job because it's so political at his company and he doesn't like to go to meetings. Is there a job out there where you don't eventually have to go to some meetings? He was laid off and did nothing for a year, then decided to learn Mandarin in Taiwan for a year, and now is looking for a new job after a contract position. He just doesn't work very hard and is not motivated. He's sponged off my parents and has not been responsible. Sometimes you have to let people make their own mistakes and learn to grow up. That's what I told my Mom and that they should stop giving him money.

      Is anyone out there?  I don't know who would ever read this but my friend Sunny convinced me to start a blog.  I'm a neophyte and don't know if there is a proper Blog etiquette for these postings or not.    I'll apologize upfront for not being that great of a writer.  English was my least favorite subject in school, I avoided taking any classes where papers were required in college.  Every time I had to do a paper or write an essay for something, I would procrastinate and put it off until the very last minute.  But I guess this is more like a journal and stream of consciousness writing so it shouldn't be as hard for me.  Don't expect every post to be witty or funny or insightful because they won't be. :)

      I was at a nightclub, The Last Supper Club, on Saturday night and there must have been at least seven bachelorette parties going on that night.  The obvious giveaway is the mini veil they make the bride-to-be wear as well as a bunch of screaming women egging strange guys to kiss her.  If I ever have a bachelorette party, I will kill my friends if they make me wear that stupid mini veil or hire a male stripper (eww, so gross!).    It's summer and that means wedding season.  Surprisingly, although I'm getting to my late 20s, most of my friends aren't married yet which is a good thing because I don't feel so left out.  I thought I'd be married by 27 but I'm a procrastinator so it isn't surprising that I'm a bit behind schedule.  Most of my cousins are getting married now.  A cousin (ok, technically not my real cousin but a cousin of a cousin but still counts as family for Taiwanese people), Abe, who is the same age as me just got married last weekend in Carmel.  I'm the youngest on my mom's side of the family, so until every single last one of my cousins' is married, I won't feel so bad.  I know people can still lead happy, fulfilling lives without ever getting married.  As a kid, I remember being very pessimistic about it and telling my parents I was never going to get married.  I hope that's not true and that I do find love, get married, have kids and dogs, coach soccer games, join the pta, etc.

      There was a dating article in the Seattle Times a couple weeks ago about how hard it is to meet new people in Seattle because people are more reserved and less approachable than in other cities.  I totally agreed with it from my almost one year of living here.  But maybe it is self-fulfilling prophecy since I expect this type of atmosphere and do not try that hard to talk to strangers, I don't meet that many people.  This week I made an effort to meet people by posting the ad about meeting people for lunch.  It was strictly a friendly lunch, not a date. :)  So I met up with 2 guys and 2 girls this week.  Next week I have a couple more lunch dates set up.  They might not turn out to be close friends but at least I'm making an effort and not sitting around eating lunch alone.

      I went to a sushi buffet at Benihana's for lunch today with my friend Tec.  Heather and Sunny - I know you both hate seafood and would never consider eating sushi unless it was made with chicken, but it was pretty good.  I'm usually not a big raw fish fan because I'm afraid of contracting some weird disease or getting food poisoning.  My favorite sushi is the cooked kind: California roll, unagi (eel), and shrimp.  I did try some raw ones today like the spicy tuna and salmon.  As I grow older, I'm getting less pickier about food.  When I was a kid, I used to hate mushrooms and pickles and wouldn't touch them but now I will eat them.  It's strange how our tastes change.

      I'm starting to have some doubts about whether or not I'm ready to buy a house.  It's such a big commitment of money, time, and energy.  I mean it's just me right now.  It's not like I'm married with kids.  How much room does one person need?  Shouldn't I wait until I get married and decide where to raise a family with my husband?  But what if I never get married and I rent for the rest of my life and miss out on having my own place.  Wouldn't that be sad?    I've been searching online and working with a couple agents but nothing has really jumped out at me.  The houses I like are too expensive and the ones I can afford are too ugly or far away.     If I Had $1000000 (If I Had $1000000)  I'd buy you a house (I would buy you a house)  If I Had $1000000 (If I Had $1000000)  I'd buy you furniture for your house...

      I've been at my new job for a month now and I still haven't made very many connections.  I'm kind of in a group of one.  The other guy on my team is a contractor, my boss is constantly out of town or on the phone, and the rest of his team is in Illinois.  I've been eating lunch on my own almost everyday.  One of the other managers was nice enough to take me out to lunch with his team twice and I did eat a couple times with the contractor.  But I feel like I need to meet more people but it's hard when they aren't in my group.  The other people sitting around me are married older women and they have their own thing going on.  So I put an ad on craigslist in the activity partners section in the hopes of finding some lunch buddies in the downtown area.  The weather has been so nice lately, I'd like to get outside more.  My group at my old job was much more social and we'd go out for coffee everyday and my friends Marisa and Connie were in the same building.  I miss the camaraderie but I know it takes time to develop.

      I tried to roller blade for the first time today.  I had roller skates when I was little but never got around to buying some roller blades until this weekend.  I thought I would go for a spin around Green Lake.    I'm good at a lot of things, but roller blading is defintely not one of them.  I suck badly.  If there was a prize for being the slowest, I would have won it today.  It took me almost an hour and a half to go around the lake (2.8 miles).  I knew it was going to be bad when after only a tenth of a mile, I had to stop and adjust my skates.  Other skaters lapped me, joggers lapped me, walkers lapped me, babies in strollers lapped me.  This one girl who was roller blading lapped me FOUR times!    I just couldn't get the hang of it.  I know I had the wrong technique and was skating almost on my ankles at one point.  My legs were hurting and shaking like when I've ice skated.  Everyone else seemed to be doing fine and skating straight but not me.  Mabye it's my $50 skates?  Or maybe I'm not cut out to do it.  It was embarrassing having to stop so often to rest and adjust my skates.  One time I sat down on a curb and couldn't get up.  I had to take one skate off and limp to the nearest tree to lift myself up.    It was worse than ice skating because at least with ice skating, most people look awkward doing it.  I felt like the only one flailing around today.  I didn't fall down but that was only due to sheer luck.  The reason I didn't quit after the first five minutes was because all the skaters and bikers were going in one direction.  I didn't want to be contrary so I stuck it out in order to get back to my car.  The last tenth of a mile was slightly uphill and I ended up taking my skates off and walking to my car.

      I went with my friends Sunny and Marisa to the Solstice Parade in Fremont today.  Interesting, weird, random, and different would be some words I'd use to describe it.  It is supposed to be an anti-mainstream kind of event and Fremont is the more hippie part of Seattle.    There were numerous bicyclists in various forms of attire.  Some were clothed, some were topless, some were naked but had body paint, and some who were just naked.  I saw more penises than I really cared to see today.  And probably more than I'll ever see in my bedroom in my lifetime. :)  Besides the naked bicyclists, there were belly dancers, stiltwalkers, bands, animal costumes, men in kilts mooning people, and other random people.  It was a lot of fun and something people in Seattle should see at least once.  Except I wouldn't bring my kids there like a lot of people did.  I think it might scar them for life.  You'd have to keep their eyes covered almost the entire time to avoid seeing any nakedness.

      It was such a nice day today, the sun was out and it wasn't too hot or cold.  I wish I lived near a park and could take a walk after work.  I went to QFC after work and Ben & Jerry's ice cream was on sale for $1.99.  Of course I couldn't pass that up!  I'm eating my fave flavor, Cherry Garcia, as I type.  I also love Chocolate Fudge Brownie and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough but they are so rich.  Started reading  Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination  by Helen Fielding (author of  Bridget Jones's Diary ).   In my cd player I have Phantom Planet, Dashboard Confessional, and Robbie Williams.  I should get cracking on knitting the baby blanket tonight.  I've done 30 out of 300 rows and only have 10 weeks left.  Since I'm addicted to TV (even without cable), I've been watching all the summer shows.   WB Superstar - that was just sad and pathetic making them think they had talent  For Love or Money 2 - guy is cute but not as cute as the last Bachelor, they always have to have a girl who is a gold digger and bitchy, people on NBC dating shows never end up staying a couple and I don't think this will be any different Next Action Star - this is good, interesting cast and some people definitely have talent, don't know why they kept Viviana though because she can't act Last Comic Standing - I wasn't that into the last one, i'll watch it if there are no other new shows on North Shore - I like the cast in this, it seems promising with good sexual tension Summerland - kind of cheesy premise, first two episodes were ok, not great but better than reruns

      My favorite sport to watch on TV is basketball.  Since I'm from LA, my favorite team has always been the Lakers.  Tonight they lost to Detroit in the Finals.  I couldn't watch any of the Finals games because it was embarrassing and the Lakers were playing badly.  They've slacked off all year and didn't play with any heart.  I was sad for what they could have achieved if they weren't so selfish.  It's weird how sports can affect you.  I've never met any of the players or gone to a game in person but it still hurts when they lose.  I get emotionally invested in teams.  I also like figure skating and my favorite skater is Michelle Kwan.  I was so disappointed and cried when she didn't get the gold in the last two Olympics.    Don't get me wrong, there were also a lot of great sports memories for me (Lakers vs Celtics in the 80s, Kirk Gibson hitting the home run for the Dodgers in the World Series, Angels winning the World Series, Lakers winning three in a row, etc.)  As they say, "the joy of victory and the agony of defeat."

      I've been reading a lot of chick lit lately.  Today I read Lost & Found by Jane Sigaloff, a Red Dress Ink book.  It was pretty good, not groundbreaking but enjoyable fluff.  I like chick lit books because they are fun, light-hearted, and utterly relatable for any single woman.    They all kind of have the same plots - single woman living in New York/London trying to deal with work crises and having a hard time finding Mr. Right.  Bad dates and dating faux pas ensue.  I like happy endings and the girl always gets the good guy in the end.    My mind would probably be better served by reading more enlightening works by Shakespeare, Dickens, etc.  But sometimes I just need feel-good books that give me hope that maybe I will find the right guy for me someday. :)

      I'm a big fan of libraries.  When I was growing up, I would borrow a ton of books from the library and read a book every day.  TV and books were my babysitters since I was a latchkey kid.  The public library during the summer would have programs where you would get points for turning in book reports and I would turn in a ton and get a lot of prizes.    Excluding books for school, I've bought at the most ten books in my life.  I guess part of it is because of my frugality (why pay $10 for a book when I can borrow it for free from the library? :)) and part of it is because I go through them so quickly.  Since I was moving around so much, I didn't want to add clutter in my life.   Anyway, today I had to go the library downtown because they said I still had a couple books when I know I turned them in last week.  I guess since the new library only opened a couple weeks ago, they have been back logged and it's taking them a while to get through everything.  But it's a nice library, the architecture and furnishings are very modern.  The library systems here in Seattle are the best I've ever used.  You can place holds on lots of things and they have quite a few of the recent bestsellers and dvds in stock.

      Today I had to attend an all day training for BusinessObjects which is one of the reporting tools that WaMu uses.  Zzzzz...it was hard to stay awake.  They always have to go slow because there are people who need a lot of help.  If they had given me a manual and I went through it on my own, I would have probably been done in two hours.    I couldn't sit still in my chair today.  It wasn't comfortable and it took me forever to figure out how to lower it.  Lately I have been very fidgety at work.  My regular chair squeaks which is annoying.  I think about trying to switch it but I don't want to steal someone else's.  At work, I shift positions constantly but can not find a good position.  I tend to slouch down in my chair and tuck one leg up.  I wish they could make better chairs.

      So I signed up for Match.com again.  I've been off it for a couple months and haven't had any dates.  Guys never ask me out when I'm at bars, grocery stores, book stores, etc.  I know I have to work on being less shy and more flirtatious.  The only guys who have ever asked me out in my life (excluding those from the internet) are homeless drunk guys or creepy men in foreign countries.  In order to get a date, I have to resort to online dating.  I got the 6 month subscription because it only cost $20 bucks more than the 3 month.  But I really hope I don't need to use it for the entire 6 months.  I'm hopeless at dating, I don't know how some women can go from one relationship to the next within a matter of days.  I'm just wishing I can find a guy to go out with for more than a few dates.  Maybe I should hire one of those dating coaches, I don't know if it's my technique or the guys I'm meeting.  Probably a bit of both.  I wish I was psychic and could tell right away if a guy liked me or not.  It would make life so much easier.

      I love a good bargain.  Sometimes shopping for me isn't about the item I'm buying but the thrill of a bargain.  I will go out of my way to another store if I know an item is cheaper there.  Sometimes I will literally almost run out of gas in my quest for the cheapest gas.  It feels good to know that I got a good deal.    I was shopping yesterday and I bought a couple of shirts that were 60% off the price which was 40% off the ticket price.  Wahoo!  I also love shopping at Bon Macy's when they have their sales where it's 50% off of 50% off.  It's great, I never buy any clothes that aren't on sale except maybe at Target sometimes.  I read the weekly supermarket/drugstore ads and plan my grocery shopping around them.  I am the worst customer a store could want because I will go in and just buy the things that are on sale which are loss leaders for them.  I know how often things go on sale and stock up when they do.  My brother calls me cheap (he's like the direct opposite of me) but I like to think that I am smart.  It takes a little more effort but it saves me money that I can use to buy a house.  It'd be great if I was rich and didn't have to worry about prices but I'm not.  It helps that I'm low maintenance; I don't need Prada bags or Jimmy Choo shoes or diamonds.

      My real estate agent recommends doing a "blitz" before getting serious about buying.  From the 100 listings of houses in my price range and the areas I'm interested in, I picked out 25 I thought were cute or reasonable.  Today, I dragged my friends along and we drove by each of them and assessed the houses based on the neighborhood and outside appearance.  It gave me a better idea of each area and what it is that I like about a house.  I will be more knowledgeable now when I view houses with my agent.  What am I looking for in a house?  I want a stand-alone house with at least 3 bedrooms (preferably 4), 1.75 baths (preferably 2.5), garage, and a fenced yard.  I have a thing about bathrooms, some of the older homes only have 1 bath but I don't think I could handle that.  It is probably from when my family lived in Taiwan.  We lived in a one bedroom shack without a bathroom.  We had to go down the block for the public toilet (which in Taiwan is the squatting kind and not very nice).    Housing prices in Seattle are ridiculous (ok, so not as high as NY or CA but still very high).  If I lived in Idaho, I could buy something decent for a third of what I will have to pay here.  But I guess there is a good reason why I don't live in Idaho.

      So I'm in the process of buying a house for the first time.  I took a home buying seminar a few weeks ago which was really helpful since I didn't know anything about the process.  It seems complicated if you've never done it before.  Yesterday, I got pre-approved for a loan and met with a real estate agent.  Tomorrow I'm going to drive by some homes that I liked from the listings.  I'm a bit intimidated since it is such a big decision.  I definitely do not want to buy something impulsively which I've been prone to do in the past (like taking the first job offer I got or buying the first car I looked at).  I want to take my time but it's difficult because the real estate market is so hyper in Seattle right now.    I'm excited to buy a home even though it will mean more responsibility.  Ever since I left my parent's house for college, I've been living like a nomad (moving from LA to Philly to Dallas to Chicago to Seattle in a span of 8 years).  I knew I wasn't going to be staying in any place too long because of school or I didn't like the city.  So I've avoided buying nice furniture or accumulating a lot of stuff because it would be a hassle to move later.    I really like Seattle and now I think I'm ready to put down some roots.  I want to plant an herb garden.  I want to paint the walls a color other than white.  I want be able to watch tv late at night without worrying if my neighbors downstairs will hear.  I want a guest bedroom for my parents or friends to sleep in when they visit.  I want...a place to call home.

      At this point, my realtor is probably thinking she would have been better off taking someone else on as a client.  In another chapter of my ongoing house hunt, I made an offer for the new Greenwood home that I thought was cute only to withdraw it the next morning.  Classic move on my part.  There were some things I really liked about the homes there - they had an extra parking space in addition to the garage, small yards, large fireplace mantles, big window seat, and a nice size master bedroom.  The thing that kept bugging me was the one interconnecting bathroom upstairs and I also wasn't completely satisfied with the location.  When I was with my realtor Thursday night, I thought I could survive with it and decided to make an offer.  But I kept thinking about it that night.  The bathroom has these two sliding pocket doors and the knobs were really small and hard to handle.  Plus, they didn't slide that well.  I thought about the times when I have guests, it would be awkward to have to share a bathroom.  I would always have to make sure I locked both doors.  I don't understand why the builders didn't put the two full bathrooms next to the two largest bedrooms.  The third bedroom was tiny and didn't need a full bathroom since it couldn't really be used as a guest bedroom.  It would have made much more sense to put them both upstairs.  The architects must have been men. :)  These thoughts gnawed at my brain and the next morning, I was doubting my decision and had to withdraw my offer.   I'm a worrier and tend to ponder the what ifs a lot.  I don't mean to be indecisive but I don't want to make a mistake and have to live somewhere I don't like (i.e. Euless, TX or Useless as the locals call it).  I've made enough rushed decisions in my life and there is a lot of money involved.  Maybe I am a little scared of such a large commitment.  I've had to be independent and make my own decisions since I was little (when your parents don't speak English, you end up having to answer all the mail, phone calls and doorbells) but sometimes I just get so tired.  As Marisa was saying apartment hunting today, I wish someone else could make this decision for me.

      In the third grade, my teacher nominated me to participate in the district handwriting contest because she liked my handwriting.&nbsp; If you look at my handwriting now, you would never have thought that.&nbsp; I don't know what happened along the way but my handwriting and printing are just bad.&nbsp; It's uneven and the characters are irregular.&nbsp; It seems like something a child wrote.&nbsp; If I take enough time and pay attention, I can get it to look good.&nbsp; But the problem is that there usually isn't enough time when taking notes at work, so it ends up looking like chicken scratch and I get schizophrenic sometimes switching from printing to handwriting and back.  &nbsp;  Never ending house hunt update: &nbsp; So I had made an offer on a townhome in Ballard last Sunday.&nbsp; It was below the asking price because I thought they were asking for too much.&nbsp; The sellers came down 5K and I upped my bid 10K.&nbsp; But they wouldn't budge so the deal fell through.&nbsp; C'est la vie.&nbsp; I'm looking at another townhome tomorrow but if I don't like it, then I think I might go ahead and get the new construction in Greenwood.&nbsp;

      I keep thinking I should register to vote one of these days but never getting around to it.&nbsp; I usually only vote in the presidential election since I don't stay in one place long enough to care about the local politics.&nbsp; But I was a little disillusioned by the last election.&nbsp; I don't think the electoral college system is fair.&nbsp; I think it should be based on the popular vote, otherwise it means some votes don't count.&nbsp; Mine certainly didn't last time since I was living in Texas.&nbsp; It's hard enough to get people to vote in this country, making people feel like their votes don't matter certainly doesn't help.&nbsp; Other countries have voting rates more than 90% but not here.&nbsp; I keep reading in magazines how young&nbsp;single women have one of the lowest voting percentages and I'm not surprised.&nbsp; I know I will end up voting though, because I think it is important to at least try.  &nbsp; Movie recommendation:&nbsp; Sunny, Marisa, and I saw Napoleon Dynamite on Saturday and it was very funny.&nbsp; It was completely random, no plot, full of memorable sayings ("Get your own tots!"), and just different from normal movies.&nbsp; We couldn't figure out what year it is supposed to be set in.&nbsp; I still maintain that it is present day because the internet wasn't as common in the early 90s.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      I made my first offer on a townhome today.&nbsp; I've been looking for a while and had seen this townhome a couple weekends ago.&nbsp; I liked it but thought the price was way too high.&nbsp; It has a lot of nice amenities like a view of the mountains, jetted tub and separate shower, vaulted ceilings, etc.&nbsp; The builders did a nice job and the complex is pretty cute.&nbsp; Each house has a name of an area in San Francisco.&nbsp; The one I bid on was called "Nob Hill".&nbsp; I decided to bid&nbsp;about 6% below the asking price.&nbsp; I don't know if they will counteroffer or not.&nbsp; But I think they are in a hurry to sell because they are getting divorced.  After looking at other homes last weekend and today, I decided to bid on this particular townhome because of the closer-in &nbsp;location and it had a lot of baths.&nbsp; It's located in Ballard near Fremont.&nbsp; I saw some other nice brand new homes today in another part of town, Greenwood, that I will get if this deal falls through.&nbsp; I like the homes in Greenwood because they are completely separate and not townhomes plus they&nbsp;have a small backyard.&nbsp; The problem&nbsp;is that Greenwood is further away and the 3rd bedroom is small and not able to fit a queen-sized bed (which is typical of most homes here).&nbsp; But they are a good investment and at a much lower price than the townhome I bid on.&nbsp;  I don't know how my offer will&nbsp;be received, I guess I will find out tomorrow.&nbsp; But either way, I think I am finally close to landing on something and will likely be moving in a month or two!&nbsp; There sure is a ton of paperwork involved in&nbsp;making an offer and there will be a lot more before I'm done.&nbsp; It's exciting and scary at the same time.&nbsp; I hope I make the right choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      God, it's hot!&nbsp; You wouldn't think Seattle could get so hot but it is 90-something degrees here.&nbsp; Ugh!&nbsp;&nbsp;People here seem to be averse to air conditioning.&nbsp; The buses I have to take to work don't have it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most apartments and homes don't have it.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Mongolian restaurant I went to tonight didn't have it.&nbsp; Sunny and I tried to catch a movie to escape the heat but unfortunately, The Bourne Supremacy was sold&nbsp;out.&nbsp; I was left to wander the streets in search of a fan.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very hot last summer too but I don't know why I haven't bought a fan yet.&nbsp;   I went to three different stores and&nbsp;every one of them was sold out.&nbsp; How can this happen?&nbsp; I'd like to kill the store buyers for their erroneous forecasting of demand.&nbsp; Then I ended up trying to buy something at Fred Meyer but had to wait half an hour in line.&nbsp; There was only one checker and he was so slow.&nbsp; This woman had to check the price of everything and then had to write two checks.&nbsp; Hasn't she ever heard of a check card?&nbsp; Then this other guy was buying some books that were 2 for the price of one but the checker insisted he needed a coupon so we all had to wait another 10 minutes before anyone could check it.&nbsp; By the time I got out of there, it was too late to go to any other stores so I have to survive another night in this heat.&nbsp; I miss California where you don't need air conditioning because you get the cool ocean breeze.&nbsp; :)

      I went on a business trip this week to visit the rest of my group in Illinois.&nbsp; As one of the managers said, I'm kind of an island in Seattle.&nbsp; It's just me and my boss out there and I only see him a few minutes a day.&nbsp; The rest of his group is in Illinois because of past acquisitions.&nbsp; It was nice to finally meet them all and bond with them.&nbsp; I miss the camraderie, joking, and interaction that comes with sitting next to your team.  I've only been on a few business trips in my life and they haven't been very exciting.&nbsp; I think it'd be different if I got to go to London or Paris or someplace better than Vernon Hills, IL or Sacramento.&nbsp; I prefer travelling for fun a lot more.&nbsp; I didn't even have time to go by the new Millenium Park in downtown Chicago.&nbsp; I guess it's a good thing I didn't end up being a consultant. :)

      I went to the Bite of Seattle yesterday at the Seattle Center and came away a bit disappointed.&nbsp; I think the hassle of finding parking (Seattle definitely needs better public transportation), large crowds, humidity, and having a hard time meeting up with people combined to dampen my enjoyment of the event.&nbsp; Plus, I wish they had offered smaller portion sizes at a lower price.&nbsp; It is supposed to be a "bite", not an entree.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I like to get good value for the food I eat.&nbsp; That's why when I go to Vegas, I wouldn't voluntarily pay to eat the buffets at Bellagio or Caesar's Palace or any of the other high priced ones.&nbsp; I'd be just as satisfied going to a cheapo $5 buffet at the Circus Circus.&nbsp; But since my parents get their meals comped or they pay for it, I will allow myself to eat the fancy ones.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; The reason I'm not that fond of them isn't the food, it is that I usually don't eat enough to justify the high price.&nbsp; I will have a salad, some pasta and soup, shrimp cocktail, maybe a crab leg, and then lots of dessert (because that's the best part!)&nbsp; But all of that doesn't add up to $30.&nbsp; My brother, on the other hand, definitely eats enough to justify the cost.&nbsp; He'll have the prime rib and tons of shrimp, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      After much thought, I had about convinced myself to go ahead and bid on the townhouse I liked the best from Saturday.  But because of my overanalysis, it was already sold by the time I inquired into it on Tuesday.  That goes to show what a hot seller's market it still is in Seattle.  It was listed on Friday and sold by Sunday and the buyers even waived the inspection.  I knew it was going to go fast but I couldn't commit on Saturday.  Buying a house is probably the biggest investment decision a person makes in their life and I didn't want to screw it up.  I don't want to have buyer's remorse and always thinking I could have gotten something better.  Oh well, I will just have to act a little quicker next time.

      I called AOL today and threatened to cancel and they gave me another month free.  Wahoo!  It's the little things like this that make me happy.  I've had AOL for almost a year now and I've only had to pay for 2 months.  I know how to work their system and you can usually get at least 4 months free before they call your bluff.  And every time you move, you can start the process all over again.  One of these days I'll finally switch to DSL/cable but I really don't need a super fast connection since I don't download music or anything.    I want to wish Sunny a "Happy 26th Birthday!"  Looking forward to going to the John Mayer concert tonight.  I was just listening to his cd to get in the mood.  Other cds in my stereo: Five for Fighting, the Corrs, Ben Folds Book I'm currently reading: John Grisham's The Last Juror

      I went with my real estate agent to visit 9 homes today.  Or was that 10, maybe 11?  I don't know anymore, they all start to blend into each other in my memory after a while.  I have a horrible long-term memory (I can't remember what happened in movies or books or my life) but usually a good short-term memory (which is why I'm very good at tests and didn't need to be a genius to get straight A's in high school.)  But I think seeing so many homes lately has muddled my brain.  I saw mostly townhomes and one house.  Since some people tell me I am picky, a newer townhome is probably the better way to go for me.  They are clean, have updated kitchens, more baths, an automatic garage (out of the 10 older homes I've been in, only one of the garages has been automatic and none are actually being used to put cars in), and are easier to maintain.  The downside is that there is less square footage, not much of a yard, view or street parking.    I think I saw a couple that I liked but it's really hard for me to commit to one and make a bid.  I haven't gone into a house and thought, "Wow, this is the place for me!"  There has always been something that could be improved.  The one that I liked the most today didn't have a view of anything, there wasn't a mantle on the fireplace, the kitchen counter wasn't granite, no parking spot for guests, not that roomy, wasn't a 5 pc master bath, yard wasn't fully fenced, and would have preferred a 2-car garage.  And this was the one I liked the most!  Can you imagine what I found wrong in all the other ones? :)    This is probably the same reason why I don't have a boyfriend.  I try to tell myself not to be so picky but I can't help hoping to find a guy with some of the qualities I want.  Ok, so maybe the population of attractive single guys who are 27-30 in Seattle with an Ivy League (or top 20) education, 5'10"+, professional and financially secure is 100.  :P  I know I got to stop expecting to find a house or a guy that is perfect.

      So I spoke to my friend Colleen and we decided to apply to be on the Amazing Race if they have another season.  I think being a contestant on that show would be the most fun experience out of all the reality shows.  You get to go to all of these cool places and do stuff that you wouldn't normally do.  Granted, some of the tasks are not that pleasant but you would have an interesting story to tell later.    I think we would have a great chance of winning since we are both really smart, well-travelled, focused and competitive.  I'm good at navigating, I can usually look at a map and figure out where to go.  Plus, I don't get jet-lagged.  The hard part would be getting picked.  As the saying goes, you gotta get a gimmick.  I'll have to work on that but I think the contestants on the Amazing Race are the most normal for a reality show.  I applied for the Mole once but I was just blah during the interview.  I'd be so excited if we by some chance get picked, I wouldn't mind quitting my job to do it.

       Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today...   I had a great time in New York this weekend.  I caught up with old friends, ate, drank, and watched the impressive fireworks.  Since I've been to New York before, I didn't do anything too touristy this time except walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and visit Chinatown.  There is something about New York that when I visit, I fall in love with the city all over again.  You can feel the energy and excitement when you land.  There are so many things to do and it is so diverse.  There are negatives such as the smell of trash and urine on some of the streets, but that is outweighed by all the positives when you are there.  I'm a West Coast girl, but I regret that I never lived in NY for at least a little while.    As I said to my friend Dan, if I was rich and didn't have to work, I would live in NY in the fall, LA in the winter, Paris in the spring, and San Francisco in the summer.  I guess I should start trying to find a sugar daddy. :)  Food eaten:  Chinese, Peruvian, bagel, lychee and green tea ice cream, Japanese, tater tots, and Italian Best comment from a homeless person: "You have a really fat ass for a Chinese person!"  Hmm, thanks pal for telling me something I didn't already know.  He did later come by and do the hourglass gesture and gave me a thumbs up.  So I guess he meant it as a compliment. Favorite fireworks:  Smiley faces, apples, Saturn, and solar system.  Sight in the subway at 1am:  This woman lifted her shirt up past one breast, was touching her nipple and fanning her breast with a tissue.  She had to be crazy.  It was an ugly sight and I'm trying to block it from my memory (much like that burlesque show at the Pink Door).  I'd like to thank Colleen for being a great hostess even though she wasn't feeling well.  I hope you feel better soon.  Thanks for the book as well, luckily airport security didn't search my bag or it would have been an embarrassing moment.

      I decided to go to Chinatown (PC term in Seattle is International District since there are also Vietnamese, Japanese, and other restaurants) for lunch today.  I took the bus since it's in the free ride area.  I'm still a little perplexed by why the city spends so much money on a free ride area.  I doubt it's for making it easier for people like me to eat lunch somewhere else or for tourists to get around quicker.  The Chinatown in Seattle is definitely not a lively one.  I'd rate it pretty low on my list as compared to other Chinatowns (I like San Francisco's the best with New York coming in second).  I've only been to the International District a few times and still haven't found any good Chinese food yet.

      Today for lunch, I ate at a teriyaki place.  Seattle seems to have an unusually large number of teriyaki places.  They aren't as ubiquitous as Starbucks here but they aren't that far off.  I've probably only eaten a couple times at these types of teriyaki places before moving to Seattle.  Now that I work downtown, I've had teriyaki maybe once a week.  It's filling and you aren't surprised by what you get.   My new boss started this week.  He seems all right.  At least he will lighten my workload a bit.  He reminds me of Mr. Clean because he has a completely bald head.  I don't know if it is naturally that way or if he had cancer and had to get chemo.  I'm definitely not going to ask him, that would be mean.

      This weekend went by in a blur as usual.  I went to dinner at the Wasabi Bistro in Belltown Friday night with some 2004 Kellogg grads to celebrate a couple of their birthdays.  It's nice to meet some more friendly faces in town.  The food was good (maybe not quite as good as I Love Sushi) and the cake at the end was a green tea tiramisu which was nice.  We went to Bada Lounge afterwards and it always seems a bit too trendy for my tastes.  There are a lot of regulars that go there.  One of the guys in our group knew almost all the staff and people there and was able to use his influence to get two people in who had forgotten their ids.  I accompanied Sunny and Marisa to look at apartments for them Saturday afternoon.  It's weird how in Washington you have 20 days before the end of the month to give notice but that also means the apt managers don't know what is available until 20 days before as well.  So you have to give notice with the hope that you can find a place you like that's available.  Later that night, Marisa and I saw the movie Harold and Kumar.  It was funny but not as funny as Napoleon Dynamite.  It's good to see more Asians in Hollywood though, and not just in the stereotypical nerd roles.   Today I went to a picnic at Gas Works park.  It's one of my favorite parks in Seattle because of the view.  The picnic was from this yahoo group I'm on.  A lot of people came and it was a beautiful day.
