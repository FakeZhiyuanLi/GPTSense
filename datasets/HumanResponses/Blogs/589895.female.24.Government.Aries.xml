      Ugh, lazy slothlike motion in morning, always get sucked into the computer vortex and don't leave for work on time. Still love my new job even though my computer decided to boot me yesterday, but I will show it!!!!! I am getting a brand new one in the next few weeks. . . I think I will bring a big red bow in to put on it and gloat that I got a great christmas gift from my employers! lol, yeah, Right! Well enough goofing around, off to work. I will leave you with this though, I sit accross the hall from Mr. Boring. NO seriously that is his last name!!!!! Bitchy it may be I still chuckle to myself evertime I glance out of my cubicle into his. (since Mr. Boring gets a dirrect window view) Ahhh. . . must leave, no more typing

      It is scary to think that knowing that Christmas is a month away is causing me to panic.  My master plan had been to create a bunch of watercolor masterpieces for all my gifts.  Starting last month. I have completed a big fat   0  .  Hmm, guess tonight is as good a time as any to start. Especially since Thanksgiving is in two days.  Where the heck did this year go anyway.  And what is with the supremely early commercialism this year? Conspiracy Theories anyone?

       We interupt these posts to tell you: Just in case anyone was wondering I do not think that I will have comments on this version since it wasn't used much before and because you can IM me for any responses. That is all the news for now. So try a link out or something nothing else here to see, so shoo.

      Welcome to the   GRAND OPENING!    So I did it!    While in an anynomous mall, today, in an unnamed shoe store, while squating down (to point out some shoes to a friend), I felt the cool air before I heard the crisp sound that velcro makes when being ripped apart. Yes ladies and gents my pants ripped.  Loud as can be.  Lets say I am glad I was in a mall.  No embarasment there folks.  never!     yeah right!   More to the real point I have created a new domain for my journal.  I hope to make the Skin more interesting/useful someday. But obviously not today. I am still a clueless novice.

      So on saturday had the Pace family gathering and it was wonderfull!!!! my aunt who is nearly 40 is now pregnant!!!!! for the first time. The really depressing part of it is that I will not be seeing her as often anymore since she is moving to Sacramento in 2 weeks.  I am the biggest sap since she has always been my closest aunt in more ways than location. . .she was like a really neat older sister. She is the youngest in my moms family.  I plan on going out there around the time of the birth and hopefully next christmas.  I already miss her company.  I recieved from her the two CDs that I had asked for from her. . . the new Dixie Chicks and the new Lifehouse. BOTH are wonderful.  Just the right amount of sappy, sad, happy.   It just doesn't feel like xmas right now. . . .i work the day before and after. . . and for the past 20 something years of my life I have not.  No week to 3 week long vacation. So although I am excited I am less so than ever before and it is quite a drag.   UGH!!! I truely need to cheer up and get out of my funk!!!  I wonder what the folks have purchased for me? mmmm happy thoughts. . . .a new car!!! (yeah right. . . the cheapskates!!! lol. just kidding. . . I really do not care I could get no gifts and still be happy seeing the faces of those I have given to.   See sappy!  Well things are still unavoidably the same.  I need more sleep.

      Ok so I continue to say I will write dilligently in the depths of this internet journal.  But lately I have been bogged down by important matters. What they are or were I can't rememeber.  However the news is this:  . . . DynCorp was bought by CSC. . . now the nail biting can begin. . . do I get layed off in 6 months or 3?  That is the biggest news for your eyes to behold.    Still boyfriendless and looking.  Still New Carless (meaning of course one that doesn't make me look like I am 80 years old) and looking. Still Homeless (meaning of course my own away from the parents) and looking. Still moneyless and spending.   This being an adult is hard.  I want so many things I can't afford.  But above all I want my independence.   As for the Holiday. . . I decided to scrap the Watercolors unfortunately (that time I can't remember what I did with was necessary for them).  I went out and did as I always do get lots of expensive gifts and go into even more debt.   Real good idea to sell a copany around this time of year. . . instils great confidence in your employees!!!  I really hope that my parents like the Sony Surround system that I got them, it includes a DVD player.  And I am hoping that it will brighten up there spirits!!! as well as quiet the loudness of the TV volume when I do not want to hear Everyone Loves Raymonds laugh track!! oh and there is that possibility that I get the new DVD player that is only a month old. . . .best of all worlds right?   Well needless to say I am really looking forward to the holiday's.  . .  the major difference this year is that I work the day before and after Christmas and New Years. and I do not get 3 weeks off. But I could take 6 months according to CSC. . . you should check out the Washington Post Articles on the Merger:  urlLink Computer Sciences to Buy Dyncorp  ,  urlLink Computer Sciences Plans to Acquire DynCorp  (same as the first I think),  urlLink Contractors' Mergers Hit New Highs .   Well happy reading. . . perhaps I will write more frequently. . . or not.

       The Blind Date   About a week ago, maybe more (life has been one time vortex vacuum lately), I was. . .  No I should back up further. . . When I came out of the womb . . .  OOPS  no that is too far!  Ok Ok, Yeah it has been a while since I wrote in here . . . tough!  Maybe I am back maybe I am not!!! So there . . . if you are a frequent visitor to see if I have updated the inconsistent blabber than be overjoyed . . . here I go!  So where was I oh yes I was going to tell you about the ‘guy’ I met on a blind date.  For a while now a friend of mine I will just call her Kitty and her significant other we will call him Kat just because I want to! Got all excited because they wanted me to meet we will call him Joe.  Kitty is on a crusade to find me a “Man” and I commend her, it has been way too long.  And I haven’t exactly been doing a grand job (see exhibit A).  Anyhow . . . back on track again . . . we went out some ump-teen days ago on a chilly Monday night in mid-January  . . .  where we consumed wine and ate Italian food and then went to Kitty’s and played Taboo.  Joe paid for my meal. (Score! point 1 in his favor, but if any of you know me I prefer to pay (and why is this? Because I am weird! An echo from Zardoz!).  So besides this I just was morbidly drawn to call him up the next day and say “Hey, we should hang out again, call me back if you want to set something up.” The unsettling phone message . . . will he call or won’t he? That was the question . . .  the gentleman he is called back the next afternoon.  (Wheew!) So now what? Well with the date set I boldly waited the week before the date and tried my best to be calm . . . it worked.    So an evening not so far in the distant past we (Joe and I) set out to have a romping good time at a local pool hall.   Where I learned oodles about his character, wit, charm, and good heart . . . He paid again for not only that but also desert at the Silver Dinner.  He (tries to hold doors open for me, but come on! I am letting him pay, believe me it is really hard to do that . . . So I need to maintain my independence and strong will somehow, right?) So after 5 great hours of good company I am left with many questions . . . Will anything happen? Will I wimp out?  Will he make excuses? Do I care? Will we become just ‘friends’? (oooo the dread! Or not) Only time will tell . . . so tune in next time kiddos!    This witticism is brought to you by lack of sleep and food!

       Quick Update  Just thought I would mention things are still going really well with Bill, I figure I could use his real name now that things are more settled. He is away this weekend unfortunately. But I will survive, the room might actually get the paint job it has been waiting for since oh, May! We shall see. Oh and there is obviously a new layout yet again! I am missing Justin's Link but I will add his next time. :) Later.

       I'm in  Heaven   I can honestly say I have never met a guy quite like Joe ever! I will admit he took some time to get the picture, but that is also my impatience being uncontrolled (I will have to work on that).  And though I am fully aware of his flaws, I would just like to call him Mr. Wonderful.  Last night he cooked me dinner! And tonight I get flowers! Will someone please pinch me!!!!!!!! I feel like a million and one bolts of electricity and 10 tons of caffeine are running through my veins.  I mean it is almost surreal like I will wake up in the morning and wonder where my dream man went.  He holds doors open, is polite and respectful. He make dinner and gives flowers.  He willingly watches chick-flicks and others as well.  So many wonderful things and more but I will stop there before I make anyone else (me excluded) nauseous.  *sigh*  In other news tomorrow night is single girls night out . . . some of the girls from work and I are going out to the Melting Pot (Fondue) and gonna get all snazzy to attend. I even went out to the store tonight to get a nicer outfit than what I have . . . I do not have much hooch wear.  So I found some sexy digs and plan to have the time of my life!  (Now if your thinking why aren’t you going to do anything with Mr. Wonderful . . . your answer is that these plans were made a long time ago . . . and there are slight complications within the relationship that haven’t been addressed yet. (Sounds a bit redundant considering all the other relationships I have had have had complications. But this one is less daunting.)    I also picked up two CD’s, John Mayer’s Room For Squares and Angie Aparo’s The American. Can’t wait to listen to them!  Other than that I am going to go enjoy my flowers and float on cloud nine for a little while.   A special thanks goes out to Meghan for the very cute V-Day card and Also a very Happy Valentines Day to everyone!!!!

      Saw the movie "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" this afternoon while playing hookie from work.  With all the snow here about 5 people showed up to work. And I just didn't have the self determination, dedication or drive to endure more than the almost 4 hours I spent there. So now I have the whole rest of my weekend ahead of me and I feel like it is the tail end of a Monday.   Heading to the 'Ville tomorrow for a very brief visit and to help instal a counter in my aunts house and pick up a brand spanking new Photoshop 7 from my aunt, who is selling it to me for a good deal.   Yup. . . so now you know, life is pretty tame on my end of the line.  Back to the movie really quickly. . . even a guy could apreciate this chick flick, ESPECIALLY if you ever had a psyco girlfriend. I was in stitches most of the movie. . .it is a must see.

       WOW!   Thank goodness for female perserverance! Yup, and of course calling and  luckily  getting the answering machine! But at least he is one to call back. Now it is time for the female overthinking to occur, 'well did he call me back because he wanted to or because he had to?, did he ask if I wanted to do something again, sometime, because he felt preasured?, ugh . . . you know what being a paranoid girl is not all that it cracked up to be. . . I think I will put those aside and just thank my lucky stars that he called me back.  Gee I wish there was a manual out there on dating and how to make it easier on us. Don't you? Can I hear a Hall lay leua!!!!? AMEN!

       Is it Just a  "Girl Thing" ?   To want to be called back? This is the question of the day.  We fret, we wonder, we create whole dialogs and we wait.   How many days would you wait? It is not as though I have a hord of men waiting in line. I think they all lost their invitations,  they will find the invitation as one of those annoying tear out cards in their favorite playboy sometime in the next two decades  and by then be unable to decode it because our language will me converted to xtml.  Ugh.   Ok so the real news, I thought Hemroids were painfull but have you ever had a ingrown toenail removed??? They hurt! This is  VERY IMPORTANT information I am about to leak out, so if any of you already know or do this than you are in the know. . .  always cut your toenails straight across, never at an angle! Unless you like that kind of torture. That is all, now back to the rant on ignorant men!  So where was I? Oh yes, MEN! Why don't they call? Is there something we . . .  WAS THAT THE PHONE? ? ?   This post was brought to you by female paranoia. . . And the Foundation for Men to GET A CLUE.

       It is hard to lose sight of a dream especially one that you’ve held for so long. I have been struggling all my life to overcome the obstacles set by my fears. Some people let their dreams die with the loss of hope. The challenge it to search within yourself, find what you were looking for and try again. The road to the goal is a lonely road with faith, belief and desire to achieve. Passion. Life struggles and overcoming obstacles are not unique to one person. Amazingly everyone goes through the frustration, anguish and grief of life. But they also go through the joy, happiness and love. I, as many people have, forget the good things and focus only on the hardships, which I have had to deal with. Life isn’t easy and you can’t just wait for things to happen to your benefit. I can’t keep skirting my responsibilities anymore. I can’t sweep them under a rug and ignore them for the rest of my life.  This past weekend I took the first step towards facing my fears and anxieties. I reinstalled Lightwave onto my PC. It was a small first step, but I made it happen. I realized that this is not going to be a small task of finishing my life’s goal, because I have to begin again from the beginning. I can’t slap something together and feel good about it. So instead of setting a final date of when I will finish and be able to present my demo-reel to myself and to my professor I am just going to take it one more baby step at a time. I might find the passion again that I once held for this particular form of art or I will move on and find a new life-goal. All I will need is the support of my friends and family, as you have been supporting me to this date. Just a word here and there of encouragement and I would be very grateful.  I am already becoming overwhelmed by my old anxieties and fears. It is this strong laziness and desire to have things handed to me free of charge that I need to get rid of.  So onward and upward so they say.

      Then I realize that our society pushes for the desire to settle down meet the right person and get married and live happily ever after and that just doesn’t work these days. So at some point I will go out there, find a Mr. Right-for-me-now, and then settle down for a bit. I will of course be 61.3 years old and he will have dentures and think I am a young buxom blond with huge knockers.

       I must have divorce on the brain. First off I am reading this book  Crazy Time  right now. It is very information-packed with examples of all the emotions that you go through during the crazy time in the midst of a divorce.  Anger, Depression, Deep Shock, Ambivalence, Relief/Disbelief and so on. Now I happen to be involved as a friend of many people who are going through the divorce process right now and I have friends whose parents are or have gotten divorced. And one thing that this book is doing for me is depressing me further. Because the only people I know that have never had a divorce are my parents. Now for those that know me my parent’s use me as a pull toy between the two of them, they might as well be divorced. They seem to hate each other so much. They make me and the others in my life make me want to never get married, have a relationship (not that I am not ruining that for myself anyway), and basically realize I am alone in this universe even though I am surrounded by people. Here is where I get to my point. Last night, and most of this week I have been having odd dreams. Last night it was a dream within a dream. The first dream my mom is in the process of getting married to a different man and dad and I are standing to one side. I turn to dad and say “are you and mom even divorced and he said yes since 1976. And I am like WHAT! And then all of a sudden I am thinking to myself I am a bastard! All these years! And then I wake up (or so I think). I ask my mom if this is true and she confirms it. UGH!!! Then I really wake up and mom is in the house and by this point I am still freakin so I just avoid asking and now that I am fully awake I am looking back on it and thinking, perhaps I should stop reading the  Crazy Time  book. But then I realize maybe one day a guy will become interested in me and want to get married to me, and all of that fairytale goodness, and then I wake up. So, you see, the moral to this story is: When in the thorough’s of your quarter life crisis, at the ripe age of 23 (since I will be in about 16 days), don’t read depressing material about how life can suck. You are most likely cynical to that fact anyways.   ( NOTE:  my parents are not the only still married parents that I have come in contact with but half of the ones I do come in contact with have skeletons in their closets that they don’t know that I know about. But for the ones I admire Meghan and Chris’s parents I salute them for actually being the 2% that can make it work!)   ARRRGGGHHH! I hate being a biter cynical old hag this early in life. . . at this rate I wont ever attract anyone, I will scare them off before they get to know the sweet, caring, generous me. Who am I anyway?   Wow albeit that was cathartic this is a very depressing entry. If you made it this far just clap your hands together and repeat after me there are such things as non-divorced happy marriages there are such things as non-divorced happy marriages . . . . and fairies too.

      I had a dream about easter eggs last night. Up until last year or two years ago I was still hunting for the hidden ones. Yes, I'm a big dork. But come on there has to be at least one thing in your life that keeps you in the realm of childhood or we would all go NUTS! (right?) Well anywho, I looked to my trusty Dream Dictionary to see what mumbo jumbo it come up with for easter eggs. . . and here it is "easter eggs predict a celebration," how vague.  Yup so for lent I decided to add something to my life. . . church. Sad but true I dont' go or rather didn't go. So now I am tempting fate and gong to a new one each week. perhaps one of them will send me a sign. I don't know. Anywho. Thats about it.

      Well it is finished. My room is done. Now all I need to do is move out, right?  This evening there was a meeting of the two companies. I got a hat, key chain and calculator for my trouble. Now I am just counting down the days until they fire me. I wonder if I could get a job at Dairy Queen, with my references I hope I could. Anywho, I am looking for a second job and a different full time job right now. We shall see how this goes. I need to be more agressive at it though. I guess it would help if I have the self motovation and determination and drive to do it, but I am just ready to admit defeat. Anywho, one week ago I wasn't much better than where I am now, but hey at least I have a nice room to return to. I think this calls for another beer! woo whoo.

       Some might be asking or wondering how I am doing?   Well here is a quick update for all you attentive readers:  I have only the closet and the bathroom left to complete, yes all walls are painted and furniture restored to its new home in various spots around my room.   Monday was an icky day followed by today which was only mildly better.   I went to my weight loss meeting and found that I have lost 7 pounds since the 7th of January! Go me! But I can’t attribute my loss this week to anything healthy, no exercise (unless you include painting my room) and I ate out practically every night. So I am wondering if it is just stress.   I am starting my job hunt again. I have not lost my job, there is still the possibility that I might, but for now I am looking because I don’t like this one much. I will admit the people are somewhat friendly but I need to be kept busy. I can’t take the boredom anymore.   As for the love life as one friend called it, only time will tell at this point. So far I really can’t complain, but then I am not sure there is anything to complain about.   So that ends my update; sorry it is so cut and dry but I am truly exhausted and tomorrow is only Wednesday. UGH!   Only 39 days left. Who can name what I am referring to? You win a big virtual kiss!

        Ponderings   I was just pondering as I usually do,  all the time. The minor exception is that I looked out my window as the sunset's sunbeams were hitting the newly formed leaves on the trees in my parents front yard. The colors are breathtaking and remind me all the more why I like rather love the spring. And the Fall for that matter. But it also reminds me of a John Mayer song 3X5 and I thought I would share the lyrics with whomever reads this blog:    I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been You held this letter probably got excited But there's nothing else inside  Didn't have a camera by my side this time Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes maybe I will tell you all about it  When I'm in the mood To lose my way With words  Today skies are painted colors of a cowboy's cliche' And strange how clouds that look like mountains In the sky are next to mountains anyway  Didn't have a camera by my side this time Hoping I would see the world with both my eyes maybe I will tell you all about it  When I'm in the mood To lose my way With words To lose my way but let me say  You should have seen that sunrise With your own eyes It brought me back to life You'll be with me next time I go outside No more 3X5's  Guess you had to be there Guess you had to be with me Today I finally overcame Tryin' to fit the world inside a picture frame Maybe I will tell you all about it When I'm in the mood To lose my way but let me say  You should have seen that sunrise With your own eyes It brought me back to life You'll be with me next time I go outside No more 3X5's Just no more 3X5's    So what did you think?

      Life is boring right now, what more is there to say?  Does anyone know if their is a way to grow money on trees? At this rate I will get money faster that way.  The Real World is not a show on TV! But both the TV show and the "Real" Real World SUCK! (What they don't teach you in school) Yeah that is about it.

       HAPPY B-DAY HUNNY   Woke up to a phone call. Went down for breakfast. Got card from the folks. Got card from Grandma. In card from folks Best buy Gift Certificate. . . looks odd due to it looking like it has been opened before don't think much about it because I have other things on my mind. In card from Grandma, the usual check in the amount she always gives. Get up here do my thing and then sit down here at the pc with the two gifts in front of me. There is a point here, just bare with me. So I am staring at the gift cert and realized it is taped shut the opposite way. So I open it.  Back story (In December there is this big Christian holiday on the 25th where families get each other gifts TO USE and keep for there own purposes!  This Gift Cert (my birthday gift) is in reality a gift that my mom gave my dad for Christmas. I do not know if I should laugh it off, or cry that I was just that worth it! They just spent $7,000 on stuff for them last Saturday and the only thought my dad could put into it was giving me something he did want to use. I must just be being picky right? Ugh!!   Anywho I FINALLY figured out what I want to do for the big 23 I am going to go to Dave and Busters . . . anyone in this area that doesn’t have plans tonight and wants to come with, give me a call at home or on the cell phone. If not take cars and talk to you later.

       Life is complex but I believe the human mind makes it so. For instance, while playing a game of scrabble tonight with my father, I was contemplating dark unmentionable thoughts. Those thoughts centered mostly on death and self loathing, real great happy thoughts ya know.  When dad randomly mentioned that tomorrow is the ‘day’ I was born on and it is my birthday. So I was born on Saturday April 12, 1980. So what does that mean I thought to myself, is this supposed to be a key moment in my life or just another day, a blip in time? Then my thoughts turned back to death and wondering where exactly we go anyways? There are no real encounters with what happens when we are dead, because for all we know we don’t ever come back. So then why are we here? What is our purpose, do we even have a purpose on this planet? Etc. Ugh it is 11:00ish on a Friday night and I am home. I’m sick to death of being in this nothingness that I have come to live within. I try to make things happen and they don’t turn out pleasantly and I try to just lay back and let things come my way and that too doesn’t seem to work, therein lies my aggravation!   So I am going to go to bed (early), sleep until I wake up, and start the day brand new (as new as I can make it anyways). Tomorrow will be a literal, physical and emotional birthday (I hope). I just need to let go.   Just in case anyone who might have gotten worried from what I have written, please don’t. I have been dealing with this emotional rollercoaster of my whole life, I will survive; it just gets frustrating (sometimes for years on end). Writing it down has helped.    One baby step at a time . . .   Last year still is, to this day, the best birthday I ever had :) I thought I would start by ending this blog on a positive note. Yea for positive thinking :)  Wonder what tomorrow brings my way? One thing for certain would be a Cake, YUM! Wonder who started that tradition? And the Candles part too . . .

        And the Quarterlife Crisis continues. . .   I am turning 23 on Saturday. And it doesn’t seem to matter anymore not just to me but to those I thought were supposed to love me unconditionally.  I have always been the one to go bonkers over turning one year older because I have always wanted to be older. I will never catch up to the people that are the age I want to be come Saturday, but then I don’t care anymore.  Because I seem to be in the funk, like in  urlLink Aarons  journal. I am at the Mexican Bar in the middle of nowhere, waiting for something. I am tired of trying to pursue what I am not even aware I want to pursue. I am just plan tired of life. If I had been born the year I wish I had been born, then I wouldn’t have to have been thrown into this shitty economy that we have today. Maybe I would have been married and divorced and had 2.3 kids by now. But focusing on the what-ifs will drive you nuts.   Mom keeps asking me what I want for my birthday, and they are all super expensive and mostly unobtainable things. Like a new car. God that would be sweet! But she is too cheap for that. So I did the cop out, I just want a Cake. . . which is mostly true. . . since I haven’t had a b-day cake since I turned 18 on Easter Sunday 5 years ago. I am not going to count the nasty-ass taste of cake I had on my 21st (I think it was laced with a drug of some sort). So anywho. . . Cake that is what I really want on my b-day (wish it was sitting in a new car, but obviously I set my expectations way too high).  Don’t have plans, could care less, absolutely hate life at the moment . . . but oddly remember that last year my wish came true (sort of). So perhaps. . . NAHHhh.  I dislike being this way. . . a word of wisdom advice to those in school pursuing a grad degree. . . stay there until the economy gets better and a word of advice to those who are worried about what there major is not matching up with what they do for the rest of your days. . . ie being an English major who loves art, there are lots of jobs out there in art if you have a portfolio and the knowledge ( i.e. Web development ) if only I had such knowledge and luck. Or perhaps . . . blah!  I am becoming a Volunteer EMT, Training starts ???? but I hope that it gives me an idea of if I want to pursue it as a possible career. The other option at this point is to join the Air Force or that Navy. Lots on my mind in that area. Hopefully next entry will be filled with lots of happy thoughts such as finding a boyfriend that won’t lead me on and then dump my ass.    I can’t think of what to do or who to celebrate it with anyway. . . everyone is always so busy when I talk to them anyway, they have lives whereas I have nothing. Arg!    (disclaimer: and this is why I hardly write entries anymore)

        ACTION PACKED WEEKEND   As I swiftly scurried out of the dunge . . . Opps I mean Office on Friday afternoon I met up with mom to go see X2. Which I must say was Xcellent!!(Gotta love the pun)!!! She and I played Scrabble and Clue and while playing I put together the Bow Bouquet for the rehearsal dinner set for 4 weeks from that day. And managed to burn myself on the glue gun only once! Go ME! Saturday I woke up insanely early for a day off and headed off to CPR recertification class. Where I actually thought I could have been out by noon. Boy was I wrong I was there from 8:45AM-5:30PM UGH! But hey it was educational and fun even though that is when my massive headache began. Got home wolfed down dinner and then headed out to see Intensity. This was also excellent! Came home and slept for about 12 hours.  Woke up. Groggily cleaned my room and accompanied mom to buy plants. All with my skull splitting headache. Anyone need one? I am looking to get rid of mine very soon.  As for tomorrow and the rest of the week I don’t want to jinx all I have going for me so I will fill you in on it later. I will say this though, that money growing on trees thing might just sprout, we shall see.  Now all I need to do is be super patient for the Matrix Reloaded. Only 2 weeks!

        Dreams    I have been having strangely vivid dreams lately. Every one of these dreams has different subject matter and each one makes me wonder. That is it they just make me wonder.  I think about them for the first few hours after I have woken up and then amazingly the ‘plot-line’ if you will vanishes and I forget the dreams subject matter all together. But last night’s dream was bizarre and interesting enough to remember. It is right up there with the animation “Spirited Away” now that I think of it.   Remember this is a Dream and has many parts that do not necessarily fit together and things within it that are not true to my life.   There is a Grandfather Clock that sits in my living room directly behind the sofa. My grandmother who lives with us sits on this sofa during the day, as if she was guarding the Grandfather Clock.  One afternoon she nods off and I watch as my father sneaks in and moves the furniture around, as she sleeps on it, to be able to open the Grandfather Clocks door and fiddle with a hidden compartment in the bottom. This hidden compartment is an entrance key to a magical realm of witches and wizards. For some reason he cannot get in and decides to climb the clock instead. I go over to the still open clock and enter the hidden realm. There are many witches and wizards milling about and none are surprised that I suddenly appeared. One of the wizards asks me to waltz. Time flies by and it is 3:00 in the afternoon I am realizing that I am late for work. In my panic I try to figure out how to fix this dilemma. A woman with red hair (who looks like a woman from my weight loss program) beckons me to a line where I can get a ticket for a train that will take me back to a hour of the day that I wish to repeat. I grab my ticket not knowing where I am going. I am on the Train looking around at all the strangers. Plethoras of mix-matched people from young to old are on the train with me. Before I could talk to any of them I was off the train and wandering in the middle of a neighbor hood many block from my house early in the morning. (Very early) I look at my ticket and see that the time I arrived was 6:00am on the date I needed with the exception that it is now 1996 (7 years ago!) I start to panic trying to remember where my 16-year-old self lived and realize that it is too far away. I would freak myself out anyways. And how and the heck do I get back!!!! I realize that I am close to a Friends house. I go knock on the door. Still in her nightclothes she sleepily answers the door with a look of surprise. I quickly explain that I am now 23 and a witch and that I need to get back to my time period and that I need a place to rest until I can figure out how to do so. Her husband comes to the door and gives me a look of suspicion. Her kids are milling behind her and then I see her daughter I feel this sudden anguish and happiness to see her I start bawling because in my real time she is dead. I hug her to me and they all stare at me in confusion. A while later at the sink, I start to glare at the Husband and say so how is the affair going for you? He glares at me and my friend looks at me baffled and concerned. He walks out of the room and I worry that I may have altered time and history because of this. I want to get back to work on time in my own time.    That is all I can remember but it was really different, that is the only word I can put on it, different. It is amazing though, how many powerful emotions you can feel when you’re dreaming. Ones that seem so real they could just break your heart right then and there. Dreams are truly a enigma.     So aside from the strange, vivid dreams I am doing well. I have now lost a total of 11 pounds and only need to lose 35 more. That number seems insurmountable now. Hopefully the number will not seem so large in a few months.   I am looking forward to the fifth book in the Harry Potter series. Maybe that was an influence to my dream? I hope that the book I preordered will arrive before July. One thing is for sure; UPS, FedEx and all other package delivery folks are bringing in a bundle from this one book. Amazing.   Work has been pleasantly busy these past few weeks. It will be like diving off a cliff soon though the drastic change in having things to do and not having things to do will be that drastic a change that I hope I don’t go through withdraw.    Going to go fetch my second cup of coffee of the day. As I stifle a huge yawn.

      I have attempted to write a bunch of times since I last wrote, but every time I have found myself too busy to get out all that I wanted to say. So I will try to synopsis everything and hope that I pique your interest to come back for my next entry which could be today, tomorrow or another month from now.  I am very content with the way things are going right now.   Well let’s see here. So much can happen in one month it really makes you think.  I really just want to focus on the one thing first that has made my life more interesting, by far.  I placed myself in a public view on the internet far further then this here blog.  Anyone who doesn’t know me personally wouldn’t know much of what I am talking about. Anywho, on to my story. I joined the free version of Yahoo’s Personals a few weeks ago. It was something I never thought I would do, but I haven’t regretted it too much so far.   I have met two guys in person so far.  The first albeit nice was too young for me, sadly, being only one year younger but he, sadly, didn’t make it worth it.   So I just bided my time and waited for more friendly folks to come along.  So a little while back I got a message that was like “come to see this hockey game with me tonight” from a random guy I had never talked to before.  Talked to him for a bit but decided I wasn’t going to go because I was tired and all the other excuses.  I did continue to talk to him and so last night on a whim, just like all other things Y! Personals related, I went on a long and really fun date.  Being that I am new to the dating world this was a really good follow up to Bill and a super follow up to the first YP guy.    An interesting thought crossed my mind (as they do constantly) but Web Cam’s are in abundance lately.  Over half the guys that I talk to through YP have a web cam and want me to view them through this new age device.  I haven’t quite wrapped my brain around it yet.  It is way too voyeuristic to me I suppose (not sure if that is the right word for me).  I think having my picture out there and this here blog is about as far as I am ready and willing to go at this point.  But it is something to think about getting one day.    So I’ve been losing more weight I am getting close to but not under 200. I need to be 165 or within 5 pounds, according to my doctor.  So far this year I have lost almost 8 pounds.  I have been exercising often. And I have been saving lots of money when I can to my savings account. (Looks like if I keep this up I will be able to move out comfortably by this time next year.) (Crossing my fingers until then).    Job wise I have been hunting and somewhat successful, this job having lost its glamour a while back.    Today I hosted a Baby Shower for my Aunt who is having a girl!  I made a Lemon Cake from scratch! And it was loads of fun. Maybe I should make baking and cooking my new hobby.  I would really like to have my own kitchen though. Two is a crowd in the kitchen when the other has intentions to try and tell you how it is done. I put together a spinach dip too.  So hope you now have a vague idea of what I have been doing with my time. Later.

      My test for Hazmat Ops is tonight.  I am really getting anxious about it, I even had a dream that I was identifying Hazardous Materials along the highway while hitching a ride from a butch woman and her male partner.  Super weird. Anywho I am also getting excited about the trip to Sacramento I am leaving for the airport at 3:20 (ack) but anything to make this trip work out.  I am one of the standby passengers. This will be the second flight I have flown alone on the last time was 4 years ago and I was flying into the same air port I believe, must be a California thing! All other flights I have been accompanied by my mom, dad or a friend.  I am going to be very exhausted tomorrow but it will all be worth it! perhaps while I am out there I will write a little bit more. My Aunt has a pool, that I hope to take a dip in because it is supposedly really hot out that way.  I do plan to try to go to Napa Valley and pick up a bottle or two of Wine.  And I hope to get in lots of visiting time.  Yay!

      HOLY COW!!!  Finally a new post!  Well I have so much to catch you up on, for those of you who have been nearby but too busy (like me).  I will start with my boyfriend. . . .started dating about a month ago now.  Yup, so he has been taking up most of my free time, what little I have left.  Secondly I finally ditched my old ball and chain the Buick is HISTORY!!!! I bought a brand new 04 Toyota Corolla on July 20th and we have been getting better aquainted after a close runin with the dealership garage doors. . . . I will have to tell you all about it when I have more time.  In order to get said wondermobile I had to work a deal with the devils opps I mean my parents. . . .in exchange for my huge downpayment I am enslaved, I mean asked to paint the whole house (have any of you seen my house?) I mean thank goodness I painted my room a few months ago.  I have the guest room painted and the guest bathroom painted and only 11 rooms left (including the vaulted ceiling) so if you want to ever see me again you can come help me paint :) OR you can visit me at the Firehouse.  That's right I am now an official probationary member of Ashburn Volunteer Fire and Rescue Company 6 soon to aslo have company 23 (date undetermined).  My hazmat class starts this sunday and I have weekend duty crew this weekend so I will be reachable by phone when I am not out on a call.  Hopefully some of you remember my number.  Perhaps you would like to visit me out there in the boonies (well it isn't really the boonies with all the colonization in the Loudoun County area.   My next wonderful news is that My Aunt will soon be having her baby and I will be visiting her out in Sacramento.  I will keep you posted.    I have to get going to the Firehouse now but I would love to squeeze some time in with my long lost blog buddies.  Perhaps I can fit you in on February 5th 2006??????  Just Kidding.   Well when I have the time (which I do but only at work where I am supposed to be "looking" busy) I will try writing more often.    Oh I almost forgot my office is moving to Chantilly the week I am on vacation!!! Oh Goodie!!!   Hope you all are doing well, I miss you guys.

      There that should suit for the time being. Still here at work and will be leaving soon.  Not sure about this storm were supposed to be getting. Just like life you know something is coming, but you have no idea how it will end up effect/affecting your life/world.  I am nervous and out of studying practice with this EMT course I am taking right now.  This weekend I hope to play catch up on studying, if I still have a home to study in.  The other option is to try to assist the other volunteers in running domestic and medical/trauma calls in the next two days.  One thing is for sure I have no desire to go to work for the next two days.

      Being unable to deny myself a long-winded Blog, it is about time anyways.  I got to meet my new cousin and spend 5 lackadaisical days in Sacramento.  I spent most of my time watching Trading Spaces, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, Ground Force, and other TLC, BBC, and HGTV shows . . . and yes the FOOD Network and BRAVO.   So I became a couch potato.   I have not watched so much tv in such a short span  of time since I was in grade school.  I know why I don’t do that anymore.  Two of our outings were worth while we went to Old Town Sac and it was truly decent, that is a lot coming from a girl who prefers the country.  We also went to Napa Valley where I planned to pick up two bottles of wine and left with four.  While I was gone my office space moved from Reston to Chantilly.  I came in on Friday and found that I had everything but a chair to sit in.  So I snagged a chair and sat around doing generally nothing.  Funny that seems to be what I am doing today too.  This promises to be one doozer of a week followed by one doozer of a weekend.  After realizing that I had a three day weekend, being overly ambitious as usual, I took it upon myself to paint yet another room or two or three.  I just barely finished, with the exception of the clean up I finished and it looks lovely. Now my parents will have to wait a month for the rest of their bedroom to be completed.  Not to mention the room to be cleaned up a bit. The doozer of a week will include weigh in at TOPS, EMT class and all that after fighting traffic from work to TOPS and from TOPS to class. Tomorrow and Thursday are from work to class and then on Friday I will be heading to NJ for Robert’s Cousins wedding.  We will be coming back to Weekend Duty only to leave it again for class on Sunday.  But wait that is not it!!!! Duty next Monday night and then class again next Tuesday and Wednesday! And that is how it follows folks for the next few months. Free time will be spent painting.  By the way I just finished the Master Bathroom and one of the Master Bedrooms Walk-in Closets.   If we included my room and bathroom the guest bathroom and bedroom and the Computer room I have finished 7 rooms! While I was in Sac my parents decided that I am not responsible for the Family room (vaulted ceilings and all!)!! Oh so relieved.  So that leaves the Master Bedroom and the other Master Bedroom Walk-in closet.   The Living room, Dining Room, Kitchen, Garage, Grandma’s Bedroom and Bathroom.  For a grand total of 8 more rooms (and the foyer, I think, so 9) anywho . . . they will get done eventually . . . I think I might take all of next year off just to breathe and relax.  It is like I have three jobs and I am only getting paid for one of them and I don’t do much but sit around for that one . . . go figure the irony of that one.  Now don’t be fooled just because I am gloriously busy that I do not think of you, I do I just don’t get time to call you until 11pm and I don’t like being rude.  So my only free days are Saturday’s . . .  most of you have that day free too so what do you say?   I hope you don’t mind me using your shoulder as a pillow for an hour here and there. J  So that and Robert keep me busy, and I wouldn’t change that for the world . . . the paint fumes must be getting to me right (not where Robert is involved though)? Well that is my long-winded update.  My cell phone still works even though it was dunked into paint a few weeks ago.  So give me a ring.  I am going back the art of looking busy at work now in my office with three other people.  *Sigh*

      I have a view from my window at work that, on nice days, is breathtaking. There are no skyscrapers rippling into the skyline and there are no chemical plants billowing clouds of pollution on the horizon.  One thing to note is our wildlife. There are no red flashes from Cardinals flying by and there are not even oily black Crows perched on the edge of the roof, there are just Turkey Vultures in all their fugly glory. Circling and preying on what I have yet to determine. Perhaps it is we, the lowly creatures that are forced to trudge in every morning.  They must be looking to find the weakest of us, the one that couldn’t make it across the vast expanse of pavement.  The Vultures especially target the brightly colored individuals who think that big flower prints masks their juicy flanks of meaty goodness.  Yes oh so busy I am here at work that my imagination has no time to wander on into the realms of the absurd.  I tell you the workload here is killer! I am lucky enough to dodge the Vultures on the way back to my car once I have escaped the dungeon that is my office.  I have three cellmates.  All have singled me out to be the first victim.  They have it in for me that they do.  I must be wise and quick-witted to outwit their plan for my demise.  Ok, ok, I know! Enough! But in all honesty there is a small bit of truth in all that I wrote in the above diatribe. But that is so much more interesting than writing: I have a nice panoramic view from my office, which I share with three people all of whom tend not to interact with me. So I sit here with not an ounce of work to occupy my time and think up wonderful entries to entertain you with and pause to look out the window to watch our half-dozen Turkey Vultures pass by our window.  Not nearly as humorous.   I find that I calculate the cost of my bills and determine the number of days until the next event or the number of hours left in my day.  I think about the news, the past, the future, the present, the things I would rather be doing, and the money I think I should be earning. The list goes on and on.  Like I have 4 hours left here at work.  Then I head to a place to get food and fill up my gas tank change clothes (if there is time) and head to class for 3.5 hours (tonight’s lecture is on General Pharmacology & Respiratory Emergencies) where I then head home to my cold bed to sleep until the alarm clock wakes me up for tomorrows 8 hours of work and a Twist . . . I will be working at the hospital tomorrow evening.  I am a little nervous.  I do not know what to expect.  I will be there from 7pm to Midnight.  Luckily I can sleep in on Saturday and Sunday.  I get a whole glorious weekend off. I have so many things I need to do but I would much rather spend time with friends I rarely see. Then my mind swings to the fact that spending time with friends requires that I have money (that I don’t actually posses). The “real world” means that you pay bills, live in debt and work.  In your free time you clean, pay bills and occasionally sleep.  Ok the cynic in me has reared its annoying head. But I tell you my thoughts then turn to the fact that I still live at home, there is no way to afford moving out even with the possibility of my 54 cents more an hour if I get the full 4% raise.  Sigh.   On a positive note I still have a job and am making money in which to pay off my bills.  I have passed the two tests that I have had so far for my EMT-B class. I still have a wonderful boyfriend.  I have family and friends that love me for who I am. And at least today I have my health.

      Has anyone seen the movie Back to the Future? Where the Professor doesn’t believe that Ronald Regan (a actor!) was the President of the United States? What would we have said a few years ago if someone told us that Arnold was the Governor of California? I am not sure what is going on with our political system in these past 8-10 years but I am not getting good vibes from it. I mean look at our last Presidential Election!!!! We need to focus on the us in US and not the others in other countries. It might sound awful but the way we were before the World Wars is how we need to be for the next few years in order to better ourselves before we better others. Now I know I started this with what sounds like disbelief and not a lot of faith in Arnold, which is not the case, perhaps he will be better than the (TOTAL) Recalled vote, but that has yet to be seen. Well I have had enough of that topic.   I have sooooo much reading to catch up on for my class!! And practically no time in which to read.  Class all day Sunday, Duty Monday, Class Tuesday, Class Wednesday, Exhaustion Thursday and then Friday and Saturday to read . . . or more accurately fall to sleep while reading. Hopefully this Saturday I can catch up on some of the reading.  Enough complaining.   I have been busy at work these past few days, which has bee lovely. Not sure how long it will last though.    Went to a Catholic wedding this past weekend with Robert. Was a full mass version. Then the reception was at the Top of the Town in Arlington Awesome panoramic view!!!!! Wish I had had a camera with me.  I will definitely look into going there again in the future . . . meaning sometime in my life.   This weekend is A duty crew weekend followed by class. And another Test in only 2 more weeks! (ACK!)   Well I am going back to work. Eventually these entries will be written better with more interesting tidbits. But I seem to always say thing like that and then months later I finally tell you the same thing again. Hmmm . . . gotta work on that.

      Okay so I have been in this wonderful relationship for 3 months (this Saturday if you can count that would mean there were fireworks the day we started dating, cliché and wonderful). Two of my Favorite months out of the year are July and October. (Obviously April too). I digress. We spend a lot of time together.  And I found that I was becoming motherly in the way I was treating him, so I am as of yesterday backing off.  I realized I went over the line and needed to reign myself in. That is not what I am looking for and that is not what he needs from me.  So hopefully with willpower I can change that awful habit. Other than that to gloat on his behalf, he is a wonderful guy who would give you anything you needed even if it was that last thing he could afford. He is a very passionate person.  He likes many of the things I like and we get along splendidly. So enough about him. (I don’t talk too much about guys that I am dating . . . unless you ask the questions).  	 I just had a great Job interview the other day and I hope that it goes my way because it would mean that I could afford a place away from the parents and that I would have the work to fill my time. (So good luck to me on that area of my life)  Class is going well my first test gave me a 99%, only hope that I keep up that pace, the County and State exams are a lot different and more to them. . . and I have a lot more to learn between now and then.   I get to spend time with friends few and far between but I have been making the time here and there and it feels great to know that they think of me even when I am not around. I used to think that wasn’t the case because noone ever called me. But now I know that life at times has a current to it that doesn’t always allow for what you think should be.   I hope that this catches you up albeit very briefly and abruptly at least enough to know that I am still here. Hope to write more soon.

      Things have been snowballing lately.  And I am worried that massive chaos will ensue in the months to come.  I have finally decided to heck with the fear of living off of Ramen Noodles, which I despise,  I am moving out.   I plan to do so by March at the latest.  The earliest will be January 1.  I am a little nervous about this big jump from comfortable living to not knowing if I will be able to pay all my bills every month.  I am also nervous because Robert, who I love dearly, will be my roommate and he makes less money than I make.  I don’t really want to pay more rent than him however for me to move out on my own I would still be in a tight situation.  But by the end of January I think I will no longer be living at home.  Don’t get me wrong living at home has not been bad.  I have had a lot of benefits.  But ones that will not change if I no longer live at home will be the open invitation to come home to visit and sometimes eat a meal will still be there.  Personally my biggest worry is money.  The rest I think I am fully ready for.  This class will be over soon; I have been struggling with a full time job and trying to pass this class, but not just pass, understand the subject mater.  This is not a joking/laughing matter. Lives depend on how well I comprehend these things I am supposed to be learning.  Obviously experience will have the biggest role on how I maintain the information in the years to come.  I also really want to buy a lot of people gifts this year for Christmas, but realize that I don’t have the money and if I am moving out in January I do not want to accrue too much debt by buying too much.  So I am trying to budget myself.  And for once I have developed a list for my family.  Robert will be heading down to Staunton with me for the Pace family Christmas this year.  And I have been invited to his house for Thanksgiving.  At this point though I am not too happy with his family and feel like they have been putting up this façade of liking me but in actuality don’t.  There words don’t match their actions.  So I ask myself why would I want to subject myself to their presence?  Which is sad because I truly like(d) them.  I was voted into the AVFRD at the beginning of the month as a full time member.  I had some very interesting ER rotations and have been truly enjoying this new life I am building.  With Robert in it I have been nothing but the   happiest that I have ever been   in my life. Busy and in Love. What more could I ask for in life?  I had really been hoping to like and be liked by his family but this puts one of the biggest wedges in that I didn’t expect nor desire.  So life is good, but my nerves are getting stretched to the breaking point.  Because I think for the first time since I graduated college I have finally started to lead a real life in the “real” world.  So the next step albeit the scariest will be the most necessary and hopefully the most rewarding.

      When you want the day to pass quickly very often the minutes seem like days.  When you have nothing to do that is.    Last year (My first Christmas at home after graduation) seems so long ago.  I do not remember much of what occurred.  And I cannot locate any blog recount of what occurred so I have to base any accounts that I mention solely on my memory that seems to be getting rusty with age. I remember the ice-cold day that my father and I put the ornaments up outside, we had our usual disagreement (due to our stubbornness) in the end I think he decorated the tree without me (which upset me).  I purchased my parents a surround sound system (which resulted in an big argument, due to stubbornness, while putting it all together).  I remember the method of (yes that would be method we are such a strategic group) which we opened gifts.  I even remember some of the gifts that I received.  And, last but not least, I remember feeling exactly like I do today one year ago.  Not the least bit excited, like I was when I was younger, and not even feeling like tomorrow is Christmas day.  I miss some of that, ok so I miss all of that.  Is it disillusionment? Is it age? Is it due to the people that I surround myself with? Is it the fact that I have to work Christmas Eve? Very possibly it is all of these things combined.    But this year there is one (most significant) change: I finally after five years, have someone who cherishes me; loves me unconditionally; spends almost every spare minute with me, and doesn’t complain; respects me; occasionally listens to (all) I have to say (I can be very long winded and redundant, for those that know me); thinks I am beautiful, tells me I am, and for once I believe that I am; he makes me smile, laugh and cry; he is honest, caring, gentle, and kind; he has his idiosyncrasies and faults (but who doesn’t, I certainly do); he is forgiving; he is always himself.  I constantly want to pinch myself because I am the happiest that I can ever remember, and I feel, like most things in my life that go so well, that something will happen to counter this happiness.  My worst fear now in my life is not the death of my parents but his death.  I am sure people would call me paranoid, but I have a very overactive imagination, and I sometimes cannot control the images that flash through my mind.  I worry so much and I am not sure how to quell the waves of fear sometimes.  I just take a deep breath reach out and hold his hand and then I know everything is ok for now and not to worry about the things that I cannot control.  So with every blessing I suppose there is always a bit of a disadvantage.  But if I was (and it isn’t the case I have already received gifts) to be in the position of not receiving any gifts this year he would be gift enough for me.   So getting off of that slaphappy sappy subject and onto something else.   I have 3 hours left and am already nodding off at my desk.  It truly doesn’t feel like tomorrow is Christmas.  I am hoping this will change once I get off of work, go home and prepare the luminaries.  A long-standing tradition; we start saving milk jugs around Labor Day and prepare the birdseed-filled ornaments of light on the Eve of Christmas.  Then we line the curb of our street.  Light them both on the Eve and on Christmas Night.  It is one tradition that I hope to bring with me wherever I go in my life. Now it may seem odd, I, being of no particular religion, raised Catholic, and yet, now a non-believer as far as Jesus being the savior of all mankind is concerned.  But I do believe in a higher being that created our universe, I do believe in the gift of giving and being as unselfish as humanly possible.  If tomorrow I won the lottery of the largest amount possible I would most likely die of shock, especially since I do not play the lottery, but I most likely would use that money towards the people in my life that are most important to me.  Wow, what if scenarios are fun . . . and somewhat depressing. If I won that much money I would pay off all my debts, buy my dream home, buy my dream car and set up a savings account for my children.  I would help financially stabilize my parent’s debts.  I would buy Robert and his family anything they desired, what the heck I have oodles of money.  Then last but not least I would help financially stabilize Donna’s finances and her families.    I finally got to see her after a four-month hiatus.  She has two children to raise and a life to rebuild.  And her tree was comparable to that of Charlie Brown’s.  I wanted to scream in frustration at the grief that Paul has brought down upon her.  The brightest, most generous, and loving woman I ever know next to my late grandmother is her . . . my respect for both of them has always been off the charts.  To see her in this kind of place in life and being unable to offer anything but prayers is heart wrenching.  I think of her as a sister, I care for her that strongly.  Family is a very important concept to me.  Not being able to help her through these troubled times is beyond discouraging.   So yet again I go into a tangent of unhappy thoughts.    Next subject:  The Christmas dinner tomorrow; I am getting very nervous.  Looking forward to it, but at the same time not sure how anyone will blend together.  I worry.  Robert’s Family meets my family (for the first time) tomorrow.  *Gulp*   The food will be tasty, Honeybaked Ham and Turkey.  Lasagna, Manicotti. Mrs. B’s biscuits (hopefully).  Veggies (not sure what kind, we always have veggies).    So tonight’s meal with them (Filet Minion yum) and tomorrow’s meal are sure to bring my four-month gain of 6.5 pounds to a even 10 pounds. Ugh. So much for 9 months of working out at a gym.  Guess I will have to jump back on that band wagon in early January . . . or March . . . or May . . .            Overall my rambling is done.  I am now a certified EMT-B and looking for a new job.  Any leads would be much appreciated.  Merry Christmas everyone!!!!!

      One week left until Christmas   All I want for Christmas (That is either impossible, or improbable)  New Job – Specifically one that pays me what I know I am worth, that I don’t dread going to every day, and that I can have a least pleasant relations with my coworkers and not feel like I am in a HS popularity match.   My Own Place – If I could choose anywhere to live and what type of place I would live in it would be a Log cabin with stonework front face. Situated next to a Lake with a boat tied up to the dock on the lake. Located In the mountains of Southern Virginia or Eastern Tennessee.    And since I am being unrealistic – A Toyota Highlander – all kinds of perks involved, Hopefully it turns into a Hybrid, with GPS tracking, Heated Seats, One of those DVD players in the back (you blink here and you see at least 5 drive by on the roads, anyone know what I am talking about?).   I am not about to go to Peace on Earth – Our civilization isn’t ready mentally, have you seen how people drive? It is like if they had machine guns attached they would gun you down for daring to get in front of you on the road.  Anyways whether that is a valid reason I will hold that wish for the future.    I am sure I could come up with more mumbo jumbo, but I am sure you would rather hear what I have been up to since I last wrote.   Even if you don’t your going to get it anyways.   I took my first of three tests exactly one week ago and passed.   I took my second of three tests this past Saturday and passed.  I took my last of three tests Monday night and I have no clue if I passed, I will have to get back to you on that. Being that it was a state test the results have to go through a number of loops and bends before I can receive them. I may or may not know the results before Christmas. That just seems bogus to me, but I can’t complain because at least I get a second chance if I fail (which you don’t get in college, and sometimes in the real world).   I have been pondering applying to Loudoun County Fire and Rescue . . . full time paid (career).  Taking steps to become an instructor, perhaps take courses to become a paramedic or nurse.  Not sure just yet.  I am still pondering.  There is always the Police officer concept that I was pondering this time last year.       I know one thing, no more desk jobs (if I can possibly avoid it).   Does anyone remember my entry about my first REAL WORLD experience? Let me refresh your memory (the bold part of the entry is what I find to be most interesting and amusing now that I am a volunteer and do exactly what I mentioned I fould so wonderful then, my how the world is full of amazing things):   Sunday, May 5  (2002)  Today marks my first official day of being in the "real world" and it has been a very eventful one at that. Crawled unwillingly out of a warm and cozy bed to say my good-byes to Jason, Meghan, Justinne, Justinne's Dad, and Harrisonburg/JMU, at 8:45am. Got on the road around 9:15am, after filling up my car, setting up my CD player with music to sing along with to keep me awake. Took the exit ramp and journeyed away from my undergraduate college onto the highway of life so to speak. I did a lot of thinking on the way back here to NoVa. Thoughts of the past and the future were swimming around. The traffic was relatively light; I sped as usual, yet not as fast.  Pulled up the street my home is on around 11:05am and burst into tears, in the driveway is a HUGE sign that says "Congratulations! To U Ginger JMU Graduate Class of 2002" My dad walked out as I pulled up as if he knew I was there. It just hit in a small way that I am not going back to JMU as I knew it . . .I am now an Alum. Come August I will not be moving into a Dorm or going to a class, in fact I have no idea what I will be doing once I get back from London on the 17th. I relaxed a bit upon entering my now permanent residency as much as I could anyway. But a shower was calling my name. Ahhhh, did that feel good too, washed off a lot of bone-deep weariness, got all dressed up and at 12:00 on the dot walked down stairs to welcome guests consisting of family and friends I have not seen in a long time. I mingled discussed London and what I will be doing, filled their ears with ambiguous answers and smiled hiding the fear of the unknown right behind my eyes. Ate wonderful food drank some beer and the whole time wished I could just go shove all the junk that is on my bed off onto the floor creep under the covers and pass out.  But! I was bitten with a bug earlier in the evening, I have received enough cash from graduating to allow me to splurge and get a DigitalVideoCamera/Camcorder that I have desired for 2 years now. But on the way to Best Buy  . . . A car started to enter a main intersection, not even a half a mile from my house, someone leaning on their horn caught my attention that there was a man with a hat in the car having a seizure. The car slowly rolled through the intersection into oncoming traffic. My Aunt who was driving started to panic and which I exclaimed that he was having a seizure she immediately dialed 911. At the same time a Man who I wish I had gotten his name jumped from his car ran after the unmanned car and opening the door and slamming on the brakes and pulling the Guy from the car, I watched in slow motion. . . time slowed and the car almost hit a street sign. . . My aunt pulled her car off the main road and I got out and ran to see if I could help. My CPR training is long overdue for renewing . . . I never had anything this drastic occur at the pool I worked at for 5 years as a lifeguard. But I assisted in having them roll the guy on his side and suggested that they rest his head on his arm for safety and support. I forgot all about making sure that he did not swallow his tongue. I know his name now I was handed his wallet, and attempted to see if he was going through a poisonous reaction to something. Turns out that for the length that I stared at it I do not remember much. Kind of a shock thing I suppose. The paramedics arrived in short order and took over and all the civilian helpers left. One of them that left early happened to be the one meddler jackass . . . but I am trying to focus on how, Total complete strangers helped someone that they did not even know. And did not ask for anything in return. It was truly a very scary and thought provoking experience. I hope that all is well with him. I am very curious as to how he is now. And hope that it was not (illegal) drug related.  So got to Best Buy and found an option and picked up the now developed pictures from graduation. Some of them look really good while others are not that great. It is really sad; to envision yourself looking one way and seeing the way you actually look. Got back here and decided to research the camera I found. And then I need to get all my ducks in a row. Mass Chaos continues tomorrow have to pack and all that jazz before Tuesday morning. Needless to say I am exhausted and was all day too.  Saw Spiderman Excellent movie. Hope it was not the sleep deprivation that made me like it so much. Now I am going to go crash! I have a long day of unpacking and packing and cleaning ahead of me.  POSTED BY GINGER | 11:20 PM    So now it is a year and a half later and I am exuberantly happy about where I am in life in most realms of it anyways. Just the job front that is bothersome.  But it was only a year and a half for me to reach where I am now so I guess I need to get some patience!   Happy Holidays! (will keep you posted on the EMT-B results).

      Stepping back in time to a day not so long ago we shall call it Snowy Friday.  Ginger excitedly left work at the ripe hour of 4 PM in hopes of enjoying an evening with Robert watching Mystery Alaska and cuddling (feel free to gag, I can’t see you J ), but due to the slick road conditions the detour into the ditch evaded her plans just slightly.  Luckily I had packed a shovel into the back of my car that morning thinking that I might get stuck in the parking lot at work.   My awesome driving skilz (yes that z is intentional) I missed the mailbox and road sign and the only damage was to the underside of my vehicle.   It will cost me with the alignment about $230ish dollars.  Black ice I hope we never meet again.  So I would like to send a shout out to the two men (I believe they might have been construction workers) who took it upon themselves to pull over and help me out of the ditch (in effect saving me towing expenses!! Woo whoo!).  I would like to try not to sound racist so please take this the right way. . .I have just had truly bad experiences with previous Latino men encounters where there are hoots and hollers and cat calls. . .these two men restored my faith that they are not all like this.  Ok, hopefully that was take in the light it was meant to be taken.  So after my saviors waited to see that I made it back onto the road I headed onto the Firehouse where the guys were cleaning up from a fire they had just successfully extinguished, saving half of the house! GO ASHBURN VFRD!!! Anywho, I gathered Robert and tried not to make him to guilty for not being my rescuer and headed to his home so that he could clean up for the evening.  In the end I ended up watching Nicholas Nickleby.  (Which I had never seen nor read before and found to be very interestingly presented.)  I woke up the next morning and with slight mayhem took my car to the surgeons I mean Mechanics to get the alignment and find out the $200 would go to replacing and installing a part that was broken from my 90 degree slide into the ditch.  Robert out of the goodness of his heart, (who had taken ill with a stomach bug that morning) became my driver until my car was fixed (because my parents were (not really) indisposed, just unwilling to help).  I am not an evil girlfriend; he is just so wonderful.  And it also didn’t help that the only day that I can Christmas shop between now and Christmas was that day and the only gifts remaining were his.  I think it worked out well enough and that he has no clue what to expect from me.  Then he helped me to pick up my Aunt and cousin who flew in from CA for the week.  V sure has grown since I saw her in August.  Then on Saturday I attended class and then at the end Robert and I hustled down to Staunton for a family Christmas gathering of my mom’s family.  Robert and I were technically supposed to be the last to arrive but due to the baby my parents and Aunt with baby in tow were in almost an hour after Robert and I and we were there and hour late and yet on time since we told them that we would be getting in around the time that we actually did arrive.  I ate, went sledding (almost flattened, yet merely knocked over a 3 year old (a next door neighbors kid) on the way down, she is ok I was a little shaken.  At that point I quit sledding for the day.) I had a short-lived snowball fight and then it was time for dessert and gift opening.  We had a lovely time.  To top off the cake of my car.  I received my first ever speeding ticket (hopefully my last those suckers are expensive!!), Ironically, right outside of Harrisonburg.  Cest la vie. Or however it is spelled.  Monday was mom’s B-day.  It went well. And I went on one call at 12:50 am for Trouble breathing.  And work has picked up slightly and for this week (so far it is manageable). The test for tonight has been canceled (woo whoo) and instead we will continue to prepare. The County is on Saturday from 9-4:30 and the State is from 7-11 on Monday.  Stressss will be minimized in less than a week. WOO Whoo. That is my most recent update.  Strong Bad has been updated SOOOOOoooo funny it is a must see. Yea for new addictions.  J  Now I am off work and heading to get food, study and then class. It is almost like college but not!!! Yea for chocolate that is laced with trace amounts of caffine!!!!

      Well I had a WHOPPING 2 hours of actual work today.  At least as far as I can tell I will not be receiving any more work for the rest of the day.  So what do I do now? I will sit here, trying to look like I am doing something official by typing this rant-filled blog and surfing the big I.  I am here until 5 . . . I started writing this at 2:30.  (2.5 hours of NOTHING, faking looking busy).  Then I think to myself, don’t they monitor our work by watching our PC’s during the day? If that is so then they will see how unnecessary I am as an employee.  I sit here and wonder what one of my sudo-bosses deal is . . . .she is so bitchy to me and doesn’t delegate work to me that I know exists, yet takes it on herself and works on it instead of giving me work.  I am about a month away from resigning and just hoping to dear god that I will be hired elsewhere where they have the work to keep me busy and pay me what I am worth.  Then I remember that I pay rent and my parents are not so forgiving if I do something that they would term a “bad move” UGH!!!! I do so not need this added aggravation especially when I have these tests coming up.    (This blog was interrupted by me “looking busy” and I rejoin you now at 4:10.  Where I hope to make this last a bunch more minutes to fill my time.)  So as I was sitting here learning about one of my pastime favorite comic strips For Better or For Worse www.fborfw.com while listening to Christmas tunes on the radio, I couldn’t help but notice the camaraderie of my fellow officemates.  I feel ousted from my own work place because I feel like I am right back in HS where I am not a part of the “IN” crowd but off on my own as a self-proclaimed loaner who everyone knows exists but doesn’t care to get to know better.  (I know sounds like another pity party doesn’t it?) Perhaps it is.  Anyways, 4:12 by y count and time for me to go back the big I and look for more interaction of a less human form.   Oh how I can’t wait for a new job! And this test to be over.

      I reached another one of those low points today where I am really uncertain as to the person I want to be and will become.  I don’t know if I want to quit working here and go back to school, if I did I would need to know what it is that I plan on going back for.  I never finished my undergraduate senior project.  The unfinished product is still in CD form collecting dust on the shelf above my PC.  I still feel like I should at least contact my professor and confirm to him that I will be unable to complete the assignment.  He gave me an A on what I did complete, and if he so wishes he could drop the grade.  Personally that is the only thing I feel like doing, as far that ghost is concerned.  I just don’t want to open that nasty can of worms.  Personally, I don’t have the time nor the inclination to finish.   Which reminds me that I hardly follow through on any of the projects that I begin.  I don’t know what I want to do for a living.  I am displeased with my current workplace situation.  There is no room for advancement.  There is also nothing motivating me to stay besides the fact that I am employed with benefits and have an income.  Personally I want something else anything else (with the only exception that I make more there than I do here and have the work to keep me busy, apparently too much to ask).  I know a lot but at the same time I know so little.  I feel like the position I currently hold is pointless and useless. I need a change.  I need more experience and schooling.  I need parents that will help me out financially and emotionally. I could use some definitive answers too.  I feel lost, upset, disappointed and most of all depressed by my lack of motivation and determination to find the answers.   The end of EMT-B is drawing near and I am nervous that I wont be able to finish successfully.  I am having a pity party I suppose.  Not completely sure what brought it on.  The lack of any actual work for the past week and a half has probably been a big stimulator of my current mood.  I am here for two more hours.  Sitting here with nothing to occupy my time, but my thoughts of inadequacy.  What a beautiful end to the year; this mood, I hope, will fade and be replaced by the answers I need (want, hope for).

       Well after much deliberation I have decided to save save save.  By saving I could buy instead of rent next year.  So Robert and I plan on saving money (as much as we can) between now and next year.  So onto the narration of my 2 Turkey Day weekend.    It all began when I escaped (pronounced “es-cop-paid” like from Finding Nemo) from work at the ripe hour of 3PM on Wednesday.  I began my trek to pick Robert up from his house in order to go see Love Actually.  I was under the impression that it began at 3:45PM, and with a little mistake cleared up we decided to go to the 6:45 showing.  After the movie we went to his house where I met the relatives I was to eat one of my Turkey meals with, they were very friendly.  We only stayed a short while before we left for my house and a game of Scrabble.  My favorite! Robert did really well but my mom kept reminding us that I always win the game and so now has Robert hissing at me . . . one of those things you have to “see for yourself” moments.  Settling in for the night shortly thereafter.    Woke up on Turkey day to help with our scrumptious breakfast of pancakes, eggs, bacon (yummmm), toast and orange juice.  Then to watch the Macy’s Turkey Day parade.  Dad didn’t start on the Turkey until late so he said that we should start our day with Robert’s family. So we hit the road and entered into the house of chaos! WOW! I mean wow! I did my best to glue my butt to the couch and not enter the main war zone area of the kitchen.  Robert and I did this by cuddling on the sofa and watching TV until dinnertime at 4PM.  There was fun to be had figuring out how everyone would fit and where they would sit.  Robert and I ended up sharing a plate.  Then we left to go to my house and eat even more food.  Good thing I left room.  Then I am not sure if it because of all the turkey I ate, but I am not sure what transpired after I just know that the next morning bright and early I was painting the Dining Room trim I wrapped up around 2 and spent the rest of the day with Robert who had just gotten off work when I finished.  The next morning began a little slower than the one before because somewhere this weekend I picked up a winter cold. So aches, pains, sniffles and coughs kept me company the second day of painting.  Without my dad’s help on the first day I would still have been painting on Sunday.  But that was not in my plans I wanted at least one day of freedom and fun on my last 4-day weekend until next Turkey Day.   So why did I paint on my only 4-day weekend you must be asking yourself?  Because it was the most opportune time and it is the last room to be painted in the year 2003.  I will continue sometime next year (only apx 4 rooms left).  It feels so good to get it out of the way.  And now our house (after 6 years) looks like it is a residency and not an asylum.  I love getting rid of the white contractor dingy flat walls.  And now we have a cozier dining room for Christmas dinner.  Robert’s family has been invited to come over.  And I am cooking the Turkey.  So if they accept, this will be one interesting Christmas.  Yesterday consisted of sporadic gift buying and spending time with Robert.  Not one ounce of studying was done. (*Gulp*) And I spent most of the day, although with Robert, still achy and sniffley.  So I don’t plan to go to duty crew tonight and spread my cold to those who would rather keep their health.  I will just use that time to rest and study, hopefully not in that order.    Over all this was a fun, productive and very enjoyable weekend.  And now I am back here in the trenches (at work).  And it is crunch time; I only have 4 classes left before the last three tests. Those four classes are tomorrow night and Wednesday night, Sunday (which will not be very beneficial, since I will only be attending 2 out of the 7.5 hours in order to visit with relatives), and a review next Tuesday.  The last tests begin next Wednesday, The County Final on Saturday and the State Exam on Monday the 15th.  Remember the kid from Home Alone after putting the aftershave on?  That is me, inside, at this very moment.  And where to fit in the holiday decorating and gift buying? First to get rid of this obnoxious sniffling. Happy Holidays everyone.

      Just one year ago I never thought or imagined that I could be at this point that I am at now.  I didn’t think that I would be engaged, moving out into my own place, and most definitely I didn’t even picture being an EMT-B.  My longest standing job in my life so far has been as a “lifesaver” type person.  Teaching swim lessons and being a lifeguard.  I used to sit in the chair overlooking all of the swimmers, watching for signs of distress and more often than not, not having to put my skills to the test.  I saved my first victim about a week after I had finished my entire lifeguard training.  I was panicked but didn’t flinch in my task.  I jumped into the lake, where I worked, and pulled the patient to safety and then went over to the picnic bench to fill out the paper work and then resume my place in the stand overlooking the water.  I learned early that you have to act and get right back on the bandwagon. But that was lifeguarding.  This is a whole different ball of wax.  When I first started running, back in July, calls I remember vividly my first call, all except what the call was for.  We were sitting at the Wing Factory (late one evening) when we got the call. I rushed out to the Ambulance and took my place in the back.  I remember looking out the window on my left as we pulled out of the parking lot and seeing Robert standing their waving. It was dark but he was still visible. We had not been dating long at that point, but I knew then that he is someone special.  I remember not knowing, at the time, what the call was or what was needed of me. I remembered the panic of what if he is bloody or dead? What am I supposed to do?  How will I handle it?  Being an EMT is by far more different than being a lifeguard. Being a lifeguard you see it coming you know what to expect and your training kicks in. But you don’t have to train for too much more than water related rescues.  As an EMT they can only give you a few general ideas of what to expect, but the rest is up to the situation. Only experience can prepare you for the more involved calls.  I can handle my share of abrasions, lacerations, blood, and possibly guts, but nothing could have prepared me for what happened on Monday.  How can anyone prepare to see a dead person? Or two for that matter? Right at, or shortly before, or after they die?  I knew of the possibility, and took for granted the fact that so far I have not had to deal with death since 2001 when my grandmother passed away while I watched and could do nothing for her.  These two fatalities were far more tragic deaths for they occurred on highways.  What lingers most is the person who miraculously survived.  My whole purpose as an EMT is to be there to save a life in whatever way I can help to make that a reality.  The images will forever be etched in my mind as a reminder that we are not invincible; cars do not shield us from harm.  And as Meghan is aware with her job, there is a confidentiality in which I must keep what I know to myself.  But I will share with you one thing. Life is precious and a gift from God.  I truly felt a presence that night, possibly that of God.  I, who for years have not had any truly strong beliefs one way or the other, felt a calming almost pious presence.  I don’t know if this means that I will now follow the word of the lord, so much as I will just make an attempt to make God a part of my life in the best way I can.  I don’t think you can see and feel what I felt without that being part of the outcome.  I keep going.  The world keeps on living.  I will be moving into my new home in 24 days.  It will be a simple place.  One Bedroom and one Bathroom.  A living area and a Galley Kitchen.  This will be Robert’s first experience living away from home.  I think we are both anxious and nervous about this step.  I am excited.  I hope that this is a good experience for Robert too.  I hope that it is a home that he feels welcome in and that he can grow to think of as his place too.  Even though my name is on the Title.  I don’t want it to be a reason that he doesn’t feel as though it is his place/home too.   Here at work and must go back to it now.

      What a Monday it has been!   It is hard to get too upset or depressed even when some circumstances today have been wide open for those emotions.  Like for instance I have to work on a Federal Holiday that I would rather have off to celebrate MLK and what he stood for.  I arrived at work to find that my badge would not work and that a small twinge of fear hit me that perhaps this is how they fire people here at good ole CSC.  But all for not it was just an uninformed badge change day.  Then I get up to my office to find that I must change my login password, and can’t seem to do so successfully without 4-5 attempts.  Then the work I actually have to do is completed within one hour of my arrival leaving me without any work for the rest of the day.  And I have to ask my menopausal boss if two days in the future I can work an eight hour shift two hours earlier than I am allow which causes her feathers to get ruffled. But none of that really matters at the moment. All because this weekend I purchased a home in Ashburn. Robert and I will now be living in Ashburn in our very own condo. Nothing too fancy, one bedroom, one bathroom. But overall I am pleased with the purchase.  We finalize everything on February 23rd.  Which means that we can move in the very next day.  Personally I will be attempting to paint and prepare.  I feel more at home when the decorating all revolves around the colors of the walls.  I have a lot of planning to get through between now and the move in date.  My parents are being a splendid help.  My mom in particular, as I said is a co-owner.  She is willing to help with all the fixings on the inside.  I hope that even though Robert’s parents are adamantly against his living with me before we are married that they will try to be supportive of our decision.  At least they can be happy in knowing that he is close by.  Anyhow staying on the happy subject, though I still do not feel that this is mine home (property) yet and probably will not until the first bills start coming in, I am very excited and eager for things to wrap up well. Hope everyone had a good MLK day and will try to write more later.

      As most all of my friend/reader(s) know by now, mostly by word of mouth (sorry),  I am engaged . Perhaps you are wondering why, or not. I know why and that is the most important thing.  We are not in any hurry to “tie the knot” we know we need a little more time and money.  My major fear and concern is his parent’s acceptance.  They are traditionalists who believe that living together before marriage is sinful.  I respect, but do not agree with this belief.  I also want to make it clear that I am not forcing anyone to believe the way I believe.  What is important to us (Robert and myself) is that even though some may not agree they will (hopefully) still be supportive.  Robert and I agree that before we get married we are going to live together.  Last night I signed a contract that will enable us to do that. (I had a lot of support and help from my mother, and I know that my father is ok with our decisions, so long as I am happy and have peace of mind about all my decisions).  Relationships that are worth their weight in gold will always come with hardships, tragedies, comedies, good-times, and so on.  What is important about a step like the many that Robert and I are taking is that we are taking them together, for better or for worse, for richer or poorer and so on and so forth. I know I want it to be with him and obviously he shares the sentiment.  I think for both our sakes that he especially, and I too, need to remove ourselves from our parents.  We both know that they are there as a resource and if anything should turn really sour, so to speak.  They (hopefully) love us no matter what decisions we make.  Life is one slue of decisions, one right after another sometimes many all at once, some bad and some good.  Support is all I ask for from our family and friends. We have met with what feels like resistance and forced merriment. Perhaps I am being too sensitive.  So let me lay this out, if you are happy then be happy. If you are worried than be worried.  If you don’t accept or agree with us then feel free to do so just don’t mask it with fake joy.  But if you love us, trust us and care for us, then please put your fears aside, and just believe in and have faith in us. Support us. There is a lot of planning and changing of dates going on right now, we are flip-flopping on many things and hopefully (I don’t think we are) not rushing.  I am content with the pace that we have set and that we are working together to make this aspiration a reality.  So whether I am married next April or sometime in 2006. I know that what I am doing right now is what is best for Robert and I and in talking to him; I know that he feels the same.    Also to clear one thing up from earlier, I just signed a contract stating that I am interested in purchasing and that I will pay x amount to the seller.  I have not received conformation that the seller accepts my offer. So I have not completed the process yet, the closing date is set for Feb 13 and moving in as early as Feb 14. So this whole thing is like the realtor friend who is helping me said, Swiss cheese contract. Lots of holes until we solidify the deal.  There are many possibilities that this contract may not be signed, and or another contract outbids us.  So, I am wishing Robert and I luck.   On other brief subjects, work is still upsetting. I am still looking for another job.  What job, right now I have no idea. So long as I can feel a part of my workforce and hopefully make more than I currently make now.   I passed my EMT-B tests and am now officially certified.  I took some last minute classes for the county and now can start precepting (a process of being released to lead a call (call the shots on the scene) and take on all the leads other responsibilities) this could be a two to six month process. So I will let you know how things progress. Who knows perhaps I will take this on as a career?  I am here at work and need to get back.

      Finished the Kitchen this weekend. I decided to forego the Laundry Room and in exchange enjoy at least one day off of my 3-day weekend.  My mom was just ecstatic about the new color of the Kitchen and how it makes the cabinets “POP”.  She and my dad are now antsy to get cabinets in to a section of the kitchen that is prime for them.  They can’t agree on what they want though.    Most of my thoughts and free moments are centered on Robert these days.  And on our condo.  Then my mind hops back and forth to all my friends.  I think of Ra, who’s in grad school and who spending time with takes a lot of planning to come to fruition (which is all my fault, I seem to be too busy). Then there is Donna, who I rarely if ever see, she has every awful thing in the book happening to her right now and I can only pray that in the end she will be able to overcome.  Seeing her is hard because her schedule is by far worse than mine.  Then there is one of my truest friends.  Heather.  I miss her.  I see her more than any other friend, but we don’t really make time for one another.  I try, she’s busy, she tries, and I’m busy.  She comes up with fun things to do when we have time and I draw blanks.  So I worry that it is mainly my fault that our friendship is failing.  I hope that it doesn’t, I care for her so very much.  I hope to blame my inefficiencies as a friend to my current preoccupation.  Moving.  One week and I will be pulling my new home together.  I have nothing but fears of failure running through my head.  I wonder how I am going to make it all work.    And I think I am going to bite the bullet (I am sure there is a pun in there somewhere) and apply to the HPD.  Police Department.  The very worst as far as I can see is that I will be rejected for health reasons.  I will look for a different job if that occurs.  I am nervous about this decision.  But have been mulling it over for longer than I have known Robert.  I think it is about time I stop skirting the issue and give it a try.  So, there you have it.  My life in Flux (at the moment).   And if anyone is curious, neither Robert nor I got each other anything out of the ordinary for V-day.  We just did our usual routine.  Am I disappointed? Well only slightly.  Being that it was the first one we spent together.  But as I told him and I have told many other friends over the years.  I would prefer that the love of my life not use the “Hallmark” holiday to show me how much he loves me but find random moments throughout the year to spontaneously take me to a candle lit dinner, walk on the beach at sunset, flowers, poetry and any other romantic gesture that you can think of.  Because that, to me, shows that he truly thinks of me and is not doing the romancing because our society tells him to.  So we cuddled up and watched (or rather I watched while Robert fell asleep as usual) a chick flick and went to bed.  And that was ok.

      On a less serious note . . . Styrofoam one of humans most environmentally unfriendly products, still used by millions, what are your thoughts?  Every morning I get to work I make my dash for the fresh, hot, albeit cheap coffee and pour it into a decently sized Styrofoam cup.  After I am done, I nonchalantly toss it into the trash.  (Irony, one of our main clients is the EPA and they require us to print all our documentation on recycled paper).  I recently acquired a free coffee mug and it stores my chewing gum.  So why not use the Chewing gum holder.  No truly good reason, well perhaps like a coworker of mine stated it is because he knows the “exact amount of sugar and dry coffeemate” to add to make it taste just right.  Then there is the Cafeteria downstairs where they package our meals in the stuff and their cups are made of it too.  Have you gone to a restaurant lately?  Been able to finish, or did you have to ask them to wrap it up to take it home?  Did you notice what it is packaged in? Yup you guessed it!   So why do we still use it if it is so hazardous to our environment? Your guess is as good as mine. I have a few thoughts on it but I think I might need to write a novel about them.   The countdown is 13 days till the walk through, 17 days until ownership, about 18-? Till move in and being broke (even though I feel that way already).  Feels like I have to wait an eternity though, this week sure felt longer than most, I think the weather had something to do with it though.   The AVFRD Formal is tomorrow.  I ordered a boutonnière for Robert, and I want to get him a red tie too.  Perhaps I will do that on the way home.  No one here in the room with me today.  I have 4 hours left. What to do?  So far I sit here and contemplate all things trivial and futuristic while listening to John Williams greatest hits.   I plan on Painting the Kitchen (Parents house) next weekend (My last scheduled 3-day weekend until May).  It will probably take every one of those days.  Still it will be one less room to worry about.  Once that project is finished I will have 3 areas left to finish to fulfill my contract with my parents.  Their Bedroom and one of the closets. Grandma’s Bedroom and Bathroom.  And the Garage.  So overall things will be finished with that before long.  I will be out of my parent’s house, as I have wanted to be for a long time.  I have Robert (and he has me).  Things seem to be going a little too well.  Just need to keep a positive open mind about everything.   Well I think I have run out of ramblings for now. Have a wonderful ice-covered weekend!

      February 17th was my last entry.  New Homes keep you busy.  Oh boy do they keep you busy.  Turns out that the previous owners never serviced their Furnace . . . costing us $5,600 dollars to replace (with a new Water Heater and AC unit).  THEN there was the Maytag Store fiasco.  Need a new Fridge won’t be getting one for a while though.  Debt increasing on my Credit Card. Ewwwy. But overall is looking good for the House Warming party this Sunday from 3-6. (Anyone who is interested in coming, please call my cell phone).    I can now drive the Ambulance in emergency situations, Lights and Sirens people, look out! J  Still not released to be a lead EMT-B, meaning I can call the shots on an incident but soo close.   And in less than a Half hour I will be officially 24 years old. My how time flies.  Took a random trip to the Burg this weekend left Sat evening around 6 and returned around 12:30AM.  Had some great Buffalo Wings, Klines and of course a visit to the NEW Super Wal-Mart.  Picked up Keith Urban’s Golden Road and listened to it on the way home.  Had two cakes yesterday, two easter-egg hunts and well, can’t tell you the rest ;)   Robert and I are still going strong, I am so happy that he is a part of my life.  Sorry for such a long stint without entries, but don’t’ have Internet at home, just here at work and at the Station.  Busy Busy Busy. Will try to write when I can. Hope all of you readers are well too.

      Nothing to do here at work on this (wishful thinking) gloomy Friday.  I am stuck here at work and counting the minutes until I can escape to freedom.  Rob is on his way here to bring me some much belated lunch, which I hear-tell is some chiken (made one week ago). Super Tastey.  I have not written since April from what it looks like, and boy are there oddles of changes to the blogger site. So I looked into changing my look yet again. On occations I have free moments to spare and am near a PC I do try to get on AIM and to update this page to keep all you friends with lives of your own some idea of how I am doing. Lately I have not been able to find recent posts to some of your sites. Seems I am not the only one with a full time job now adays, and no home internet access. Life hasn't changed much for me lately. For some reason I feel like I was caught up in a riptide and am really not going anywhere with my life. Patience would do me good I suppose.
