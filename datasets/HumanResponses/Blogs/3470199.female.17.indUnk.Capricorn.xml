      Funny, how words are always said. I hear the same speeches. Things are never put into action however. This place is a tomb. I'm living Outside, everywhere else. When I walk in they bind me, the opposite of "Lady Lazarus". I die everytime.

      Well The shirt came off.  I am memorizing "Lady Lazarus" by Sylvia Plath. I love it.  "Peel off the napkin O my enemy. Do I terrify?-----"

      I told myself I would not fall victim to their tricks. I tried solidifying this when the manager told me I could "pick any color you like while me and your dad play with the number." Look...I'm not twelve. I am aware of your tactics. So I drove, and the awkwardly large salesperson talked about the radio. He put it on "Nasty Girl" at first. I wanted to shoot myself in the knees. That would be less painful than that. Don't get me wrong, I love "Crazy In Love", but really...come on. Anyways, he finally asked me what I listen to, and he actually knew what channel the college station was on! So, I fell, just like I said I wouldn't. I was fratrinizing with the enemy.    I hate people.    The exsistance of Men is only a myth.

      I love Napolean Dynamite. A friend, who is a girl, spent the night and watched it with me and my other friends.   I worked 9 1/2 hours today. Stupid Dell people have to be there at freakin' 7 in the morning. Blah. Anyways, work sucks, I smell, but boy(s) at work are cute.  I need a way to stop driving illegally. Oh! I know! A license!  Pretty uneventful since the last time I posted.  Rock on

      I was going to go see napolean dynomite for free again, but we got there too late. So instead we saw Saved! It was really funny, and being a christian, I didn't find it offensive. All these people wthin the christian communitiy are rising up about how this is a bad movie, and that christians should boycott it because it portrays us as hypocrites. Hello! Most of us are. Actually everyone of us is. I believe that falls under the catagory of falling short of the glory of God. Anyways, people should not talk about things they don't have a clue about what's going on.

      So, that was hell on earth. Camp sucked. Basically, no one I liked came, I was put into a room with people I did not like, and the few people I thought were pretty good friends blew me off. Lovely. I was pissed. My team didn't win anything. I got hit in the head with a vollyball. The way up there and the way back I was stuck on a bus full of annoying junior high kids. I didn't get any sleep.  The thing that bothered me the most were my "friends." It seemed like they didn't want to do stuff with me, or that I was in the way. I don't know, but my boyfriend was among the group of boys. When I did talk to them, they asked me if it sucked, I told them it did, and they were just like, "oh well, sorry." They didn't even ask if I wanted to maybe do stuff with them during the times we could actually do stuff. I understood they had to practice sometimes, but they just ignored me. Vent, vent, vent.

      Now, have they not only "in a sense" snatched the car out of my hands. No, no my friends. They have managed to literaly take the car away. I no longer have a car. Fuck, fuck fuck. Now I have to go to fucking youth camp. Four days in a room, sharing a bed with people I hate while my friends get a room to themselves, don't have to go through any of the bullshit of camp that I do, don't have to respond to alter calls or anything, because they're above that because they're in the band. Meanwhile, none of my girl friends are coming, so all the way up there I'm going to be in a bus full of people I don't know, nor care to know because they know nothing. Someone how I have to manage to be polite to everyone. Even though im going to be sick and miserable and frustrated and think about how I don't have a car now.

      I feel sick. Like someone has taken me aprt over night and didn't know how to put me back together afterwards.   He came over and saw my car. We watched the first two Harry Potter movies. My sitting there the whole time. He did something that made my want to break my glass then shove the pieces into my heart so that he wouldn't think about what my dad just did, and my dad will feel bad because it was his fault I attempted suicide.

      It doesn't bother so much that they aren't getting the truck for me, but that she can't much up her mind. So I suffer because I am being constantly disappointed. I know I sound ridiculous. They are considering getting me the truck; they should just make up their minds though so I don't get put through hell. It's like they put it in front of me, and it's in my hands, and they snatch it away.  How sad. It's like he wasn't ever there. Like we're not missing a part of us. Like without him we're better. I miss him. It was for him to decide. He wasn't screwing anyone over. He had to make a decision. For now what he has now is best, or he's just trying to make the best out of it or something. But what am I saying? I don't need to speak on his behalf.   I hate that because of my gender I play a role in our group. It was a role I was comfortable with at first because it wasn't a gender role, but now it is. Opinions count as a fraction of everyone else's. If I air any of these grievences I'll be pinned as a feminists. Woohoo

        You have a dominant kiss- you take charge and make sure your partner can feel it! Done artfully, it can be very satisfactory if he/she is into you playing the dominant role MEORW!    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      I need to get out of here as soon as possible. I don't care about any of the costs. Blah. I'm trying to get a job at Hollywood Video. I have a friend who works there so hopefully. Who knows? Camp is hard. I could live with an F-150. Even though it would be so typical for someone living in "hicktown" as someone calls it. Yes, Hate is a very strong word to use. I like "loathe" instead.

      So, it turns out that being cryptic and not using any type of name in my blog has turned out for the best. Also, not letting the boys know that I had a blog was a good thing, otherwise I would have been in the same boat as them. The got caught because one of them used a proper name.   They're out playing tennis. I'm tired. Time for night-night.
