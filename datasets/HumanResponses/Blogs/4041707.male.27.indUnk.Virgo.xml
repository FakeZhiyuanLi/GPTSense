        We had an awesome day yesterday. I hope everyone that did not go is kicking themselves right now. The weather was perfect. Hardly a&nbsp; cloud in the sky.  
 We met up around 11 at the gates. Then proceeded to the Q-Bot rental shop. I highly recomend them. We spent $20 each on a gold pass. That meant that we never waited in line. I almost felt guilty as we walked by people who had been waiting sometimes over an hour to ride one of the roller coasters. It was great. We got in every coaster there and rode most of them 2-3 times. Superman was definitely the highlight of the coasters.&nbsp;I think everyone rode it&nbsp;3 times at a minimum.  
 I&nbsp;think everyone will agree the best event of the day was the giant swing. This is the thing over by the Scream Machine. We were pulled about 150 feet in the air then pulled a rip cord which sent us plunging into a 40 foot free fall before we started to swing out over a lake and then a crowd watching. It is closest thing you can do to bunging jumping or skydiving. We were all pumped after that. I think i'm still shaking.  
 All in all it was a great day and we will definitely have to do it again next year.  
 I think my boss is on to me. He came by this morning to see how I felt. I started talking about food poisoning and he&nbsp;just said&nbsp;"OK, right". Maybe the sun burned face was a dead giveaway.  
 Mary took some pictures so I will get those posted in the next couple days.

       Wow. I never knew I would be this involved in politics. I can not believe that I passed on watching the Braves in a pennant race battle and a bad ass Agassi tennis match last night to watch C-SPAN for four hours. OK, not really. I had two TV's in the room. But nonetheless I watched the Democratic National Convention all night. Talk about some great speeches. The true Al Gore, not Al-Gore-Rhythm, gave the best speech I have ever seen by him. He actually seemed like a normal man, not stiff and monotone as I remember him four years ago.&nbsp; And he was actually funny. 
How about Georgia boy Jimmy Carter? That old man still has some spunk. He was dogging the Bush administration throughout but managed never to say the B-word. 
And finally, Slick Willy. I knew that good ol' boy from Arkansas can speak, but that was probably one of his best. I would have voted for him right there. Too bad he has already served his two terms. Did he get impeached or not? I think he did but served out his term. Does that make sense? 
Just thought I would share my thoughts on an exciting night of C-SPAN.&nbsp; I am pumped for the next three days of covereage!

       An oldie but goodie. At least that is what I heard. Who wants to get back on Tom's mom, or who just got off her?

       Two topics to address here.
1. Rob had asked about a name for the team. Did anybody submit ideas? Are we still going to vote? 
2. I talked to Alex and Brad and both wanted to join our league but could not afford the $100 entry fee. This seems a little steep. Alex is considering making another league with $20 entry. Would you guys consider lowering the amount so we can all play together? Is there a compromise? Maybe $50?

       Topic proposed&nbsp;by Al-Gore-Rhythem. 
I would have to go with the 5 carrat earings worn by Michael Vick.&nbsp; What sort of gay ass shit is that?&nbsp;I thought he was supposed to be tough.&nbsp; I want to rip those fuckers right out of his ears and use them to bribe Beamer to let Marcus play ball. Hey Michael, hook a brotha up.

       Since I am in control, I get to start the forums. Submit topics for us to debate. I want to see originality, creativity, controversay. Remember this is not some mama boys blog site. Even though Carter was invited to join. Let the good times roll.

       i thought i would start up another lively debate. Who will go bald first? We all know Carter is on his way. JB is a close second. There is some extra space under Tom's fro. There is even speculation that I may soon be waxing my head. Who will win the race of more head space?

       I did not even know what a blog was until a few minutes ago. Where have I been? This is the wave of the future for open forums, newsgroups, and mail lists. We must ride the wave. 
OK, really I was just bored at work and was killing time. 
So let the games begin. Who will post the first blog? Who even cares? Who wants to debate the first issue on our blog? Who's more hairy, Tom or Dustin? 
I look forward to some creative thinking and out right dissing of your friends. 
Enough for now. I'm out.

       WASHINGTON, DC—In the interest of national security, President Bush has been asked to stop posting entries on his three-month-old personal web log, acting CIA director John E. McLaughlin said Monday. According to McLaughlin, several recent entries on PrezGeorgeW. typepad.com have compromised military operations, while other posts may have seriously undercut the PR efforts of White House press secretary Scott McClellan.
A July 24 posting read, "Just got back from a lunch with Colin and Adil Moussa (one of Prince Saud al-Faisal's guys). Colin wants the Saudis to send some troops to Najaf—so some of the soldiers are Arab, I guess. This Moussa guy sure wears a lot of jewelry. A golden chain, a golden ring with his initials or something, and some other sparkling stuff—kinda effeminate. Anyway, best of luck in Iraq, Iyad."
McLaughlin, normally hesitant to express public disapproval of the president, said the blog was "ill-advised."
"I would hate for the president to inadvertently put American soldiers at risk," McLaughlin said. "We work hard to maintain the integrity of state secrets. When we see the president posting details of troop movements, international counter-terrorism negotiations, and even the nuclear launch codes, as he did on Monday, we have to step up and say something."
Bush said he could not understand McLaughlin's anger, characterizing his blog as a "personal thing written for friends and family or whoever" and therefore "none of the CIA's business."
Nevertheless, U.S. Secret Service director W. Ralph Basham objected to the blog, as well.
"He is compromising his safety and the safety of those in my department," Basham said, citing a post from last Thursday in which Bush revealed that he "had to go to some secret meeting with Norquist at some Marriot [sic] over in Virginia." "Someone could uncover some serious state secrets, if they took the time to wade through all of those photos he posted after he got that digital camera in June."
On Saturday, Basham asked to pre-screen all blog activity before Bush posts it online.
Bush rejected Basham's request and later that day wrote in his blog that "Some people who shall remain nameless apparently do not know there is such a thing as free speech in this country."
Members of Bush's re-election team have urged the president to exercise caution with his blog, perhaps because of posts like the one dated July 8, 2004: "Another long day of speeches and fundraisers. Met with all these phony media company execs. Had to promise them some bill next term and shake a lot of stupid hands, but they did bring in two or three million or so. Whatever. Karl keeps a list. I got big laughs during my speech, so I'm happy."
Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie said he spoke to Bush about the blog last month.
"After he mentioned our Monday message-of-the-day in a Saturday post, we've really been pushing him to not talk about campaign strategy," Gillespie said. "He's not that involved in the planning anyway, so it shouldn't be too much to ask."
"We're not trying to stifle the president's creativity," Gillespie added. "We think it's great he's taking an interest in writing."
Bush maintained that he's doing nothing wrong.
"I know so many people, but I'm way too busy to keep in touch with all of them," Bush said. "Whether I'm talking about our strategies in Gitmo or my dogs down in Crawford, the blog is an easy way to let everyone know what's been up with me. If I've just had a really good lunch at a new restaurant, or something funny happens in a briefing from the NSA, I want to let my friends and family know about it."
McLaughlin said it's likely that Bush will eventually agree to submit his blog for review by the Secret Service.
"Right now, the president insists it's his right to have it, as long as he doesn't work on it during White House work hours," McLaughlin said. "But I believe we'll be able to convince him, if we let him calm down. And even if we don't, frankly, I can't see the blog holding his interest for too long."
