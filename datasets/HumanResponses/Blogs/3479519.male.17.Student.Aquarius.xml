       Not too much exciting has happened this weekend, I've just been really busy. I've worked Saturday, Sunday, and am going in today to work 4-close and it's  urlLink Memorials Day . I hope I make lots and lots of  urlLink money  -- hopefully. I really like my new job as a "server assistant" at Mahi-Mah's. The people there are really cool and pretty laid back about things; except Cherie. She is  urlLink gay . She's the sidework Nazi. I like everyone else though, especially the girls.   I finally got to detail my car yesterday. It smells good on the inside and is... well, shiny? It sucks having an old car because no matter how well you wash and clean it, it's still not going to have the same flare as it would if it were a suped up 97' v-tec Civic Si. Oh well, I should be getting a new car within the next year or so anyways.  Saturday me and Derrick decided to skip youth group. It just isn't as pumped as it use to be. Maybe it's the fact that there is like 3x the younger  urlLink kids  and none of the people that all use to hang out together go anymore. I'm glad that they're all there to worship God and stuff, but I think it's time for me to find other time to worship God. I think I'm just going to start going to  urlLink VBCLC  church on Sundays in the morning or at night, whichever I don't have to work.   I'm also re-thinking this whole  urlLink Young Life  trip. Do I really want to spend $400 more dollars on something I'm not totally pumped for? Or do I just pay back my mom the $100 that we had to put down as a down payment. Young Life just doesn't do it for me anymore. It feels more like a social gathering than a Christian based thing. I mean sure, if that's why I was going to go on this trip for in the first place, I'd still go. But back when I put that $100 down payment I thought it was something more than a social gathering. Now I know the people there better and I'm just turned away by the whole thing. Half the Young Life leader's there drink and hook up with different girls every day of the week. It's just wrong in my opinion and I don't think I'm up to spending $400 dollars for a trip that's meant to bring teen's closer to God but really is a week long trip for them to get away from their parents and go hang out with a bunch of  urlLink hot girls .   Well I guess I'm going to go do my  urlLink homework  for tomorrow and wednesday so that I don't have to do it then because I know I'm just going to want to  urlLink sleep  when I get off work. Take care guys.
