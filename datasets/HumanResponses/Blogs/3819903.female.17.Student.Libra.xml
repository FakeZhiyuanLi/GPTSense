      Today was very sun-filled, and glourious.  Woke up and made a mad-dash to the grandma's pool so I could get some great sun!  Drove the brother and I to the pool, so he could tan his white neck, and play with our cousins.  So when we arrived at my grandma's house, my rich aunt Margaret had brought over some tennis contraption.  It would shoot balls out and you would return them in to the net provided.  So I take a try, and granted, I have played tennis for only two years, and that was 3rd and 4th grade!  So I take my Softball induced swing and smack the ball into the net! The first couple of times I hit the net right on...then the control was lost, I started hitting them over the net, to the side of the net...My grandma's Leg.  Yeah, swung really hard, and she was coming around the corner of the house at just the right time, that the line drive hit her in the calf/shin.  So I immediately felt like shit, and her leg was already starting to swell and bruise.  To make it worse she had had two other bruises there before and they were almost gone...until I hit them...and made one BIG bruise.  So, in the end, the joke was passed around that I was going to be taken out of the will, and forbidden from playing tennis ever again!  So, I went in the pool, got some sun...then had to report to work...because Nikki had to go up north!? Ok, 2.1 hours of work, that beats my previous record!  So worked with NB, and was lazy of course.  After Hell--we all decided that a nice competitive game of mini-golf was the ticket!  Teammates: Kaitlyn, Nicole, Kevin, Abby, Amanda, Greg, Sam, and Amanda's Sister Rachel and her friend Jen.  So the innocent, yet competitive game of  Putt-Putt,  went pretty slow, we had a nice line of people forming behind us!  So, after the par 50 round of 18, the standings went as followed: Kaitlyn (44); Abby, Amanda (53); Kevin, Greg (55); Sam (57); Rachel (59); Nicole (60); Jen (62).  I had 2 hole-in-ones!  I got lucky alot too!  But it was a really fun night in the first place! We also hit up the batting cages too!  I tired the fast-pitch cage 3 times--with really bad results.  I think I hit 15 out of 36 balls possible!  I couldn't hit those at all!  The bats were also ridiculous as well, they were really heavy, and really stiff!  Oh well!?  Hurt my wrist in the process though! Ouch!   After our fun filled night--we headed on over to Abigail's House to continue the fun by watching some Animal House!  Classic Comedy!  Wow, definitley need to have that in my college DVD collection!  So, I decided that it was time to retreat to my bed, and get ready for my medieval sunday!  Nicole, Me and some other people are heading to the Bristol Renaissance Faire!  Can't wait to see some hot guys joust!  I am for it!  Or all of the "peasants" kissing my feet becuase I'm beautiful!  haha So it should be a great day, and most likely will be getting a great tan!  So that should be an interesting blog for tomorrow!  ;-)

      Have you ever had one of those days, where you don't really know what to say to sum up the day?  Well today's one of those days I guess.  It was a fun, lackadazical, best friend day.  So after rolling out of bed around 10, I decided I wasn't going to "waste" my day away by sitting in the living room on my computer, and watching "Best Week Ever" on Vh1.  So, I made a couple errands all before the strike of noon!  You know how it goes: Bank, Haircut, Store.  Then came home--to show off my new do!--and read my amazing book (that I'm surprised am not done with yet), and call up a couple people to plan out our evening.  That was the predicament of the afternoon: Brewer Game, Or Manchurian Candidate?  We would be going to the Brewer Game with Kevin and Ryan-"we" as in Nicole and I- and all of his High School friends that we really don't know that well.  OR  The Manchurian Candidate with the "Three Amigos," Kate, Nicole, and I.  So, after thinking a while about the difficult situation, I thought, haven't seen Kate in a while, and in order to keep our friendship...I really think it should be a girls night...even though I was tempted to hang with Hot guys all night.  So prior to my "girls night," I went with my brother to get his own Haircut.  If you've ever seen my brother...he has a full head of hair, shaggy style, and all of a sudden he says, "you know what?  I think I wanna get a haircut, and cut it all off, so then I can grow it back over the school year!"  I thought it would be cool to see my brother with short-short hair, seeming as though he hasnt had it short in like 3 years.  So, we head on over to the Cost Cutters on Silvernail around 5:15: 45 minute wait...no, so head on over to the Cost cutters on Meadowbrook...30 hour wait...no, I have to be at the theater by 6:30!  So then our last resort was Great Clips on Moreland...So I guess that would have to do, since it was now 5:30!  So we walk in...and I swear it was a scene out of  Rocky Horror Picture Show!   There was the one girl, who says to us as we walk in "Welcome to Great Clips my name is Deb, what can we do for you" like it was programmed it to her, with a monotone, lifeless voice.  So, I answer her question, reluctantly, "um...he needs a Haircut, a BIG one!  So as I look around at the "high school drop outs" working there, I see a woman, who is "pierced" at least 5 times that I could see!  Two in her nose, One in her lip, and a "mutiple" of piercings (that I consider one, cause I couldn't count them all!)  Her hair was poorly dyed, and she had made temporary dreads with gel that morning...doesn't she sound like a winner?!  The other, "stylist", was suffering from over-exposure from the sun, and dyed her hair in the dark!  Plus the fact that she looked like the female version of Chewbacca!  No Joke!  So, the final middle aged lady, i don't know what she was, she just stood there, and watched everyone cut hair...She had clown makeup, and looked like she had a Lion's Mane!  It was three different shades of roots, and was blown up and out, probably trying to get the "volumizied" effect...gone a stray!  So...the haircut...the main reason we were there, was sooooooooooooo damn long, it was ridiculous!  ok, he has longer hair...shave some time by just cutting chunks off so the electric shaver doesn't get clogged! But no, this lady took fucking forever!  We walked in the doors at 5:30, didn't leave til 6:25...It shouldn't take so damn long to cut a guys hair!  I was livid!  She was so tidious it was unnecessary!  No need to take 6 minutes, styling a BOYS hair!  Put gel in it, mess it around...and you're done!  Ahhhh  I was such in a hurry to get out of there, because I had to be at the theater by 6:30, and I still needed to drop the bro off, and eat something!  Ahh  So needless to say, she did a good job, but I didn't have the time, nor the desire to give her a tip!   Manchurian Candidate, got to the theater at 6:50, movie started at 7, so I wasn't late, but still I hit every, single, freaking red light on the way there!  Overall, the movie was really good!  I thought the plot was good, a little predictable, but still had you shocked at the end!  Go and see!   Then we got some food, and headed on over to Nicole's to chill, talk to her brother, and just catch up with Kate, whom we haven't seen in a long time because shes ALWAYS with her boyfriend.  It was a good night, and good day!  Off to watch some Moulin Rouge...Damn good movie as well!

      Woke up sooooo early today!!!  9:00!  God help me!  it was weird looking out my window, and seeing the sun at a different brightness than the Noon sun!  which im used to!    Reason for my absurd wake up time, was to go and meet my golf teammate from Edgewood at 10:00.  Shes really cool, by the way things look right now, I'm pretty sure there are only gonna be 3 "talkative" people on the team...Gretchen, Ali, and myself.  Wow, hopefully we can convert these introverted people to outgoing, un shy girls.  So we walked around the mall for a while, bought a couple things, then she had to go to the work--where she has an internship--and works with dumbasses.  Not even doing anything that involves her major...which is a little redundant!      Plans were originally to go and golf with Kevin, and Simone, but...We took forever at the mall, and they scheduled the tee time without any consent of mine, of 1:30, which is too late, seeming as though i work at 3:15.  So it was a bummer, but no loss, there is plenty of time left to golf this summer.  But it was kind of cool to hear the Simone was going too, because thats 2 good golfers, I'm used to playing with at the most 1!  So, I guess I will need to plan another outing and tell kevin to invite him, I wanna see what type of game he has!      So that plan failed, now I had all the time in the world to relax before  2.5 Hours of Work  which is a little pointless, all we do is read magazines all day, and watch people we know come into the hospital... pointless.   Worked with Emily, the coolest person to work with, she is so funny, she has the most random things to say!  Work= kaity bored    Then...went home to eat some great Mexican Food...yummy.    Retreated to abby's House to watch Havana Nights--Gay Movie!  So apparently I missed the memo, about bringing the lap top, cause Abby, Nicole, and Amanda all brought theirs!  So I used Abby's Desktop to Chit Chat with the World.  By the end of the night, Kraus, Cal, and Brian showed up, where I bitched out Brian for talking about his dick so much, and that talking about it is definitley not going to get him layed, like he hopes.  As Nicole said, "we like men with confidence Brian, and you obviously don't have any if you're talking about your penis!"  So yeah after we bitched him out for lying so much, and trying to get women to suck his dick...we told him, Brian you're going to have no lady if you are so arrogant!  Damn, I thought that when high school ended--so did the drama?!  Apparently I was incorrect!  So, beside our little mishap with immature boys, we all kinda left, because abby has to get her beauty sleep to get up early tomorrow...$10 says she isn't asleep yet!  But it was fine, the boys were off to play some Halo, and the girls just went home!    So after my, semi-eventful afternoon/evening, I came home to watch some Old School with the Bro, and type at the same time!  Ok..Will Farrell's Buttocks is calling me! Adios Friends

      Eventful, and Interesting Day, in the world of Kaitlyn!    Woke up before the strike of Noon for a change...11:45!  Kind of chilled on the Computer for a while, then hit the Range with my Papa.  Hit um ok, I guess you could say!  After my rendezvous with the Western lakes crew, I headed on home to...well to do nothing for about 5 hours!    5 Hours Later:  I had done nothing but, sit ON my butt for 6 hours..to the point where I forgot to eat lunch!  So to curb my hunger pangs, I head to the store for some munchies.  Then retreated back to my humble abode, to get ready for my long atticipated "date."      6 o'clock rolled around, and Gams arrived to takes us out for the "classic" dinner and a movie!  We hit up Oscars- to which I've never been- and ate some "grub" as he would call it! haha  Then we had the sly idea of going to Tar-shay, and getting some candy to slip inside the movie theater!  Oh boy, the first attempt to be  Rebelious  all night!  headed on over to the Movie Theather, arriving a good half hour early!  oh well, more time to chit chat! So when the long awaited sequel began, and Matt Damon, aka: Jason  Bourne  appeared...I knew it was gonna be a great movie!  get my drift ladies?!  The movie all-in-all was really good!  Minus the bouncy camera shots!  That was a little nauseating!  So the movie definitely was up there with such greats as...The Notebook, Spiderman 2, The Village (in 2 days).  After our movie buzz, the kind gentleman, politely opened the car door for me (thats a first for me...finally a well mannered man in Waukesha!).  We decided that a cool way to end the evening would be to stroll along the river, in frame park.  Well...thanks to River Fest starting tomorrow, every entrance to ANY parking lot...was closed!  So we Exnayed that Idea!  So, of course, us being two golfers, we headed to Moor Downs.  We did a little trespassing, to get in, but it was worth it! haha, lets just say it was making my  rebelious  night more exhilerating! hahaha We walked around the course...of course, did cartwheels down the fairways, and played in the sand traps!  we raked when we were done of course!  Then headed on over to Mack's, that was some good chocolate malt!  haha  Then the night came to an end as we went on home!  Overall Rating of the night:  Damn Good First Date!    Tomorrow'a Plans:  Meet my Edgewood Golf Teammate, and play 9 with Kevin.  Then...Hell!  oh well, you know, working 2.5 hours is still $15 bucks you didn't have before!  OK...off to get some shut eye!

      &nbsp; So today was definitley alot more interesting than last night!&nbsp;   Woke up, Nicole came over to give me my graduation/going off to college present...A PELLOW.&nbsp;(note: Nicole has a speech inpediment...and she has a hard time saying I's, ex:&nbsp; Pell=Pill, Melk= Milk, Pellow=Pillow) This pillow was so cute!&nbsp; It had purplely colors on the front and on the back was a collage of different pictures of group gatherings...you know, a pillow of memories, per se.&nbsp; So now all i have to do is find something as cool as that to give to all my buddies before I leave!&nbsp; Damn, it's going to be hard!&nbsp;   Work--Worked with Ann for the second day in a row, and didn't talk to her...again.&nbsp; I read Angels and Demons the whole night (slow night!).&nbsp; I read 100 pages in 5 hours...while working!&nbsp; Pretty freaking amazing...and Pretty Amzing BOOK!&nbsp;   Q: What happens every Tuesday?!&nbsp;   A: Nip/Tuck Night of Course!  Ginny's House to pool it up, and watch nip/tuck...this week we did!&nbsp; Played in the pool for about 15 minutes--admiring Kyle's Hot Olympic Bod!--and then got out to watch our gruesome show.&nbsp; This episode was good!&nbsp; The "life coach" is seducing every part of the family (not the mom), the son, the father, and the biological father!&nbsp; Freaking Hystarical...she's such a whore!&nbsp; Oh well, don't think I'll be swimming next week!&nbsp;   Snuck out of Ginn's to play some poker at Joe Jr.'s House.&nbsp; It was Jr., Justin, Nicole, Sam, Joe Sr., and I playing some Hold 'um!&nbsp; So Sam was forced home within the first 10 minutes of play...so it was just the five of us for a while, all holding our own--no leader yet.&nbsp; So then when the old man went up to get some shut eye, we divyed up his chips, and played with the four of us.&nbsp; We started at 10:30, and ended around 12:35.&nbsp; Nicole, of course, has to obey her "elementary school curfew," -as Joe would call it- and was out by Midnight.&nbsp; So the three of us battled it out!&nbsp; By now, I had a monsterous lead into the last half hour of play.&nbsp; Joe: wasn't so lucky with the chips tonight!&nbsp; He was out first.&nbsp; Justin and I played for a decent amount of time!&nbsp; We started this one hand, ante being 40, and I had Ace, 7, suited.&nbsp; So I bet alot (mainly because it was getting late...and I had the chips to do it!), about  600  i would say.&nbsp; So the flop is down: Ace Diamonds, 3 hearts, 5 diamonds.&nbsp;  Ok, looking pretty damn good so far ...but the ace, 7 suited...were spades.&nbsp;  Whatever..I was like the pair of Aces! &nbsp; So the turn is pulled out...7 of diamonds!&nbsp;  Amen to that...lets add another 100 chips into the massive pot thats building!  And the river...a 3 of diamonds.&nbsp; So I'm sitting there, content and confident in my betting, pretty sure I was going to take it all home, and wim for the second time in a row...a Justin has a Flush!&nbsp; AHHHH&nbsp; No Way!?&nbsp;  I lost 600 bucks worth of Chips!  Oh boy!&nbsp; So now i go from taking a commanding lead, to dumping it away!&nbsp; So now...Justin Has an even lead with me!&nbsp; I was getting some pretty good hands now...but in the middle of my loss...Kevin Gams gives me a jingle!&nbsp; So maybe I was a little thrown off!&nbsp; he asked me out on a date tomorrow--Dinner and Bourne Supremacy!&nbsp; Sounded good...Damn Good, So I'm now set for a date tomorrow!&nbsp; Hell yeah!&nbsp; Ok back to the story!&nbsp; Overall...Went all in..And lost!&nbsp; So I took second...and Joe said he was really impressed!&nbsp; He thought I "just had beginners luck the first time...but i held my own tonight!"  So off to bed now...Hittin balls tomorrow, and a Date to attend!&nbsp; ooh Lala! Goodnight Friends!

      Ok...Today...Uneventful.  Got up, rather late...but with a satisfying--snore free--nights sleep.&nbsp; So I decided that I had been broke for the last 3 days, and need some cash, along with something to yield my hungry stomach.&nbsp; So hit up the bank and T-Bell.&nbsp;   Came back home to check the Edgewood Email, to see if this girl from the golf team had wrote me any interesting stuff.&nbsp; She writes the funniest emails...sounds like we will get along Quite Well on the team this year!&nbsp; She has the same attitude and personality as I do...funny gal.&nbsp;  Got ready to work a smaller shift than normal at "Hell," 4:30-8:30.&nbsp; You would think I would have nothing negative to say about the shorter shift--But I do!&nbsp; I worked with Ann, whom I normally can keep a decent conversation with for a while...but tonight...I think we spoke like 10 times to eachother, in small increments!&nbsp; So I read magazines, and Angels and Demons...needless to say, we weren't busy!&nbsp; We made a grand total of $145.82.&nbsp; That sucks!&nbsp; But in the middle of our long stint of absent customers,&nbsp;  Dan:&nbsp;The Owner of Sprizzos ,&nbsp;comes in to Introduce himself to us, and give us a menu so we can order out food there.&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's a $25 limit on delivery!"&nbsp;  Well lets see&nbsp;Dan...We are the only two here right now...and&nbsp;we're&nbsp;definitley not going to&nbsp;buy $25 of food to split between the two of us! &nbsp;The dude was like 5 feet tall too, I felt like a giant!&nbsp;   But after our uneventful gift shop experience...Ann went Bowling, and I headed on over to Nicoles house.&nbsp; A group of them went to see The Bourne Supremacy...without me!&nbsp; Abby said they were planning this soo far ahead of time and that they couldn't push back the time...5 people went.&nbsp; So whatever...I'll see it by myself!&nbsp; haha, so at Nicoles house, I pull into the driveway..and two cars are there(besides Nicoles), Abby's and Sam's.&nbsp; So we head down to the basement for a night of pure chit chattin'.&nbsp; I like days like these...relaxing, no bickering at eachother...it was nice.&nbsp; So we talked about every imaginable subject...We even talked about Observatories...bet you don't have conversations about that everyday!?&nbsp;   So around 12 we headed on home...tired from a long day of nothing.&nbsp; Now its time for bed!&nbsp; Ciao mes amies!

      Wow, these last 4 days were kinda nice!  Chillin' near the Wisconsin River, in a nice Resort, and playing some golf!&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp;  Except...  The fact that I was with the family for 4 days straight!&nbsp; AHHHH&nbsp; I'm about ready to pack my bags...NOW...and head off to Edgewood tomorrow morning!&nbsp; I was sleeping in the same room with 5 other people, 4 of which snored!&nbsp;&nbsp; AHH, I dont think i got a decent night's sleep the whole stay!&nbsp;   Well besides the point, the weather was great, the water was fairly warm and the golf was amazing!&nbsp; We arrived on Thursday to the Chula Vista--a resort in the Upper Dells--the non-commercialized Dells.&nbsp; The resort was beautiful of course, and the river was even more glamourous!&nbsp; Wow, it was soo pretty seeing all the bluffs and river boats floating down late at night!&nbsp; So Thursday was kind of uneventful--alot of sitting near the pool, and going down the slides.&nbsp; But I did make a run into town to get a book, the prequel to Da Vinci Code: Angels and Demons.&nbsp; Personally, I like it alot more than the Da Vinci Code...but that was amazing as well!&nbsp;&nbsp;So we stayed in the resort for dinner, and rested (or tried to rest) the remainder of the night.&nbsp;  Friday was an awesome day!&nbsp; We got up...kinda late, and proceeded to play some golf at  Coldwater Canyon -a golf course nearby the resort.&nbsp; So we played away, front nine kinda sucked for me! shot a 48, but my dad shot a 1 under 34.&nbsp; So we headed on the back nine, myself hoping for a better back, and my dad looked to keep his "up to par" game going strong.&nbsp; So on the 13th hole, when my dad takes honors to go first, on the par-3; he takes out my 9-iron, and says "Kaity, how bout your 9?!" And in my mind right now im going,  wow, I need to birdie this hole, and my dad to bogey to be even with him.  So i didn't even hear him say that to me as I sat in wonderment in the Cart.&nbsp; So he gets up to tee off, with a ball he found in the woods, a Strata 4 (couldn't have picked a crappier ball), and smacks its dimples with my 9-iron, and i yell " nice shot dad, what club was that?"&nbsp; Obviously, wasnt paying attention before when he was talking...whoops!&nbsp; And he didn't answer my question, he replied with, "go... go..., get in the hole!!&nbsp; And God answered his prayers!&nbsp; It got in that hole!&nbsp;  My Dad had his first Hole-In-One!&nbsp;  And his kids were there to watch him do it!&nbsp; My dad started crying right away, as we ran up the path to jump on him with hugs!&nbsp; He cried, I cried, my brother cried!&nbsp; It was amazing!&nbsp; And to make it even better...he had witnesses!&nbsp; You can't have an official Hole-In-One, unless you have witnesses that aren't related to you!&nbsp; And there were some: on the next tee, they saw the whole thing!&nbsp; It made it even better! So got some great pics, of him picking it out of the hole...wow, i still get chills from talking about it!&nbsp; That might sound lame, but for a person who has been playing for 40 years, and to have never gotten one before, made it soo awesome.&nbsp; He deserved it!&nbsp; It was soo cool.&nbsp; Its not like it happens everyday!&nbsp; Oh yeah, and to make his visit to Coldwater Canyon even better...It was the courses first hole in one ever in the history of the course.&nbsp; So he had his picture taken, and given like $50 in free stuff...oh yeah...and if anyone wants brats--we have a life time supply now! hahaha  Saturday was ok i guess...nothing compared to the day before.&nbsp; We sat around the pool all day, got a nice, semi-even tan, and read my book...got half way through it in like 2 hours...its sooo damn good!&nbsp; So after our lax day in the sun...we got ready to hit up DAMON'S, a restaurant near the Kalahari.&nbsp; This is the coolest eating place in the dells, with amazing food.&nbsp; There are 5 screens to watch any television show imaginable...and you can watch all and listen to one, at your table.&nbsp; So we listened to the brewer game, and played this nationally interactive trivia game on screen 3.&nbsp; This game is awesome.&nbsp; Kind of like Jeopardy, but you play with the whole restaurant, and score as a team basically against tons of other&nbsp;restaurants across the nation!&nbsp; So our team, ZOGS, are kickin' some restaurant ass!&nbsp; We end up taking second in the restaurant behind this man who eats there every night, and knows all the questions by heart.&nbsp; Gay.&nbsp; So we got some certificate for placing in the top three.&nbsp; It was pretty cool!&nbsp;   So after our rendezvous through the Lake Delton/Dells area...we head on back to room to watch the Punisher...that thankfully didnt work!&nbsp; hahaha&nbsp; So we turned on Ocean's Eleven--it was on T.V.&nbsp; We all fell asleep to the replay that happened around 11:30.&nbsp;   Today: I drove with my brother around the Dells (i drove my own car up, too avoid sitting with the sis and her friend), looking for a place to buy sweatshirts that you could personalize!&nbsp; well we found one..actually we found like 6 places that did that.&nbsp; So I got a red sweatshirt, with a lifeguard logo, and Herzog on the butt of the sweatshirt...it turned out really cool actually!&nbsp; The we headed to Timber Falls, to play some Mini-Golf, it was a pretty cool mini golf course!&nbsp; It was on the river ,and lots of pretty flowers.&nbsp; Needless to say, I kicked my brother's Ass!&nbsp; hahaha&nbsp;   Alas, it was time to head back to reality, and endure the hour and half ride home.&nbsp; Ha make it and hour and 15 minutes, going 80 with a rest stop!&nbsp; hahaha&nbsp; We even got off at an exit to fix my loose hood (that was scary) and found out that the on ramp to east-94...didn't exist...so we had to find our way home, or see a freeway sign.&nbsp; We ended up taking a&nbsp;back&nbsp;road for like 5 minutes and luckily, my experience with the&nbsp;Oconomowoc and Dousman area (thanks to golf and skiing),&nbsp;I knew where i was going.&nbsp; It was still pretty impressive that I drove 100 miles in an hour and 20 ish minutes!&nbsp; haha  So it was an eventfully delightful weekend excursion!&nbsp; minus the snoring!&nbsp; So I had fun, the papa had fun, and I am now in dire need for some good sleep...so off to bed!&nbsp;

      So today started off like any other day: Woke Up, ate breakfast, hit up the computer...And then my dad asked me if I wanted to see my aunt Margaret play in the Pro-Amateur.&nbsp;  Its a golf tournament that raises money for foundations, but you only get a spot to play with a pro if you, either: Have mucho denero to by yourself a spot, or, you get offered a spot by a sponsor. Marge got offered a spot by the company that was the main sponsor: covenant Health Care...She just so happens to work for them, so she had an easy chance!&nbsp; So she was 1 of only 5 women playing, she was in a group 5 people, 4 women, and the pro-- Pat Moore.  This Guy was apparently a pro...But I had never heard of him!&nbsp; There were pros there that I had heard of before though!&nbsp; Dave Roesch...He's from Menomonee Falls, and he had the lead at the US open this year for a round (then lost it!).&nbsp; So we saw him, and I saw another famous person (not a pro, but still cool), Terry Porter, the Coach of the Milwaukee Bucks!&nbsp; I also met the UW golf coach, Jim Shuman.&nbsp; We talked for a while about my scores, and about the Edgewood team, and he even said that I could come and visit him at University Ridge for a lesson...I was for it!&nbsp; I thought it was cool, we were the only spectators there!&nbsp; So I think I got a present for going!&nbsp; A free lesson from a great pro!&nbsp; Hell yeah!&nbsp; Well needless to say I already get good lessons from a PGA pro,&nbsp; Dave the Wedgie!&nbsp;   After the rain filled day, and seeing some famous people,&nbsp;we headed on home so the bro and sis could get to their baseball/Softball games.&nbsp; That was an interesting ride home!&nbsp; But somehow my dad fixed my brakes!&nbsp; We drove my car, and they used to be jerky brakes and I hopped in the car to go to my softball game...and they never jerked once on the way there!&nbsp; I was pleasantly surprised!&nbsp;   So my Softball game today was really fun!&nbsp; Hot..Humid..Mosquitoes...Couldn't ask for a greater night! haha...Well we played really well, and I had a pretty good game!&nbsp; No errors, and was 2x4!&nbsp; I didn't strike out like last week! Thank god!&nbsp; And I definitely flirted it up with the hotter older men!&nbsp; wink!&nbsp; hehehe.&nbsp; Can't help the fact that they do it first! And they play next to me...Or in front of me!&nbsp; (get my drift!?)...Todd!&nbsp; WOW&nbsp; anyway...We won 10-2, and we definitely need to beat them!&nbsp; I had 4 put outs, and had tons of balls hit towards me, but they either were foul, or caught by Todd in front of me at 3rd!&nbsp; So hey, cant complain about that one!   I'm going to be gone for the next 4 days, relaxin' in the Dells.&nbsp; Not the stereotypical dells, but the nicer end-Northern Dells, in the Forest!&nbsp; But we have big plans to hit up Noah's Ark, and Big chief to get some Go-Kart Action too!!&nbsp; It shall be fun!&nbsp; Ahh...This resort is beautiful!&nbsp; Its deep in the woods and on the Wisconsin river.&nbsp; So late at night you look out the window and you see riverboats paddling done the river with all their lights on!&nbsp; Its soo pretty!&nbsp; So I'll be back on Sunday with the results of my awesome trip up north!&nbsp;   Goodnight All!

      So after my exhausting day, yesterday...surprisingly, I wasn't tired or really sore this morning!&nbsp; I thought for sure that my arms and legs were gonna be dead from the rock climbing.&nbsp; Nope...I just that damn in shape!  So woke up to my father walking into my room asking me the dumbest question..."do you know anyone in a white car, cause they've been parked outside our house for 10 minutes?"&nbsp; uh...I dont care!?&nbsp; If they arent getting out, and arent harming (or planning on harming) anyone...then I could give a shit.&nbsp; So, to please the father, I looked out the window facing the front of my house, and sure enough...the car had left!&nbsp; Because I got my ass out of my comfy, warm bed, to see something that might have been important...and it leaves!&nbsp; Of course!&nbsp; Ahh oh well, so i figured it was 11:15, I might as well just stay up, cause I didnt want to wake up later than 1...I had to work!&nbsp;   Work.&nbsp; Wow, I think i have made my statement clear in the posts on the days I have worked...I can't stand it!&nbsp; I got ready for work, and got lunch, and headed over to the hospital, to work with the new girl, Jessie.&nbsp; She was actually really fun to work with today...and we forgot to do magazines...whoops!&nbsp; Oh well I'm gone in 19 days, they cant fire me!&nbsp; haha, stupid old ladies!&nbsp; So the entire shift, I was reading magazines, and talking to Jessie, and talking on my phone to Caleb...who actually called me first!&nbsp; Surprising after our fight we had last night, i thought he wouldnt want to come swimming at Gin's tonight, but he was like...what time you coming over there?&nbsp;  uhhh..after work..duh?!&nbsp;  so I told him around 8:30, and i would meet him there.  Nip/Tuck night, of course, meant partying in the pool, and not watching our event title.&nbsp; I brought my   Blue Bikini   to work to change into, so i could run through the house, and hop right into the pool...it worked!&nbsp; Kevin Gamms was back from North Carolina, and he was there chillin' with NB and Ryan Andrews.&nbsp; It was fun seeing them run around in soaked boxers!&nbsp; wink!&nbsp; hahaha&nbsp;We stayed in the pool until we got hungry...made a wendy's run, and hopped back into the pool!&nbsp; I swallowed soo much water, it was ridiculous...I always get dunked by Kraus and Cal...It's inevitable!&nbsp; They were asses tonight...ahh i give up, I can't be nice to everyone anymore...they will forever be assholes in my mind.&nbsp; Oh well, I'm happy that I will be and hour and a half from both of them next year!&nbsp; ahh..that'll be nice!&nbsp; So I left when the boys: aka...Kraus, Cal, Kevin, and Steve, decided that they were gonna go pool hopping...naked!&nbsp; Uhh..w/e&nbsp; So we watched as they practiced their cannonballs, then they got naked, and ran to the car!&nbsp; It was a sight to see, wasn't a bad sight, but they're assholes so I wasn't attracted.&nbsp; If Kraus, and Cal were not to speak and just stood there, covering their parts, they would be attractive to me...but...they open their mouths and it all goes away!&nbsp; which is unfortunate I guess.&nbsp; So, they were off to be assholes to random people...as they terrorized their pools with their weapons of mass destruction: Cannonballs!&nbsp;   Ah..now im just sitting at home on the 'puter, as I complain about my chlorified eyes, and dry skin.&nbsp; And my dehydration taking control of me...wave motions.&nbsp; It seems as though I'm in the wave pool at Noah's Ark..nope!&nbsp; I think thats what i get for being in a pool for 3 hours!&nbsp;haha

      Oh My God!&nbsp; Thanks to Nicole and Pat...we had to get up soo damn early to play  9 holes , at Willow Run!&nbsp; 9 holes...and we had to be out at 8:00!&nbsp; Are they nuts!?&nbsp; Ridiculous!&nbsp; I go from waking up at 2 one day, to waking up at 7:30 the next...thats a big jump!&nbsp;  &nbsp; So our four-some headed out on the 1st hole around 8:30, and we played at a pretty good pace.&nbsp; We ended up finishing right on schedule...11 o'clock.&nbsp; Pat and I tied with 49...it was a dismal 49!&nbsp; Wasn't a well deserved 49--I thought i played like shit, but thats just me!&nbsp; Joe showed off his new clubs (very nice actually), and was playing pretty well until the last couple holes.&nbsp; He finished with 71, and Nicole came in with 80.&nbsp; See, nicole really doesn't have that bad of a swing!&nbsp; Her back swing is really good, but when she has to make contact with the ball...its not always guaranteed!&nbsp; She would probably need like 3 lessons to get her hitting the ball hard, and straight...and longer than 50 yards!&nbsp; She has potential!&nbsp;  &nbsp; After our outing...Pat and I got some food, and Nicole went home to get ready for lunch with Amanda and her roommate.&nbsp; Joe kind of left in a huff, but we wont go there!&nbsp; So...I went home to get ready for the second part of my day...Rock Climbing!&nbsp; Yes! &nbsp; Nicole and I decided yesterday, that we going to go rock climbing with Dan Wilkerson. Hmmm...yeah haven't done that in like 6 years!&nbsp; Adventure Rock!&nbsp; HAHA&nbsp; so we get there..and the first thing the guy asks is how old we were!&nbsp; Hmm..Nicole had that covered!&nbsp; I, on the other hand...am still 17!&nbsp; Damn them!&nbsp; So they said they needed a parent signature...so we decided to head over to Banting where my mom was watching my brothers game...but Nicole's brain clicked in and said,  "How Would They Know?!"  I thought that was the most genious thing she said all day!&nbsp; Wow...Nicole was living like a rebel...is she sick!?&nbsp; So I called up the mom, and asked if I could sign her name for her...so i didnt need to go out of my way!&nbsp; I did, then sat in the driveway for a while, and walked on in when Dan got there.&nbsp; They didn't suspect it one bit!&nbsp; Nice!&nbsp; Go Nicole!&nbsp; So it was off to use muscles that haven't been used in a while!&nbsp; Wow, didnt think i'd be that quick at getting up!&nbsp; It was really kind of hard after a while of holding on, but it was kind of nice...a&nbsp;great work out!&nbsp; It's definitley is hard on the arms though!&nbsp; You need a lot of upper body strength!&nbsp;  &nbsp; So when we were done getting cramps in our hands and shoulders, we went to subway to get some chow!&nbsp; we were sooo hungry!&nbsp; Then we realized that we had to be at the bowling alley in 45 minutes!&nbsp; Lets see..I'm Broke, Tired out of mind, and am soo sweaty--Don't Think so!  &nbsp; So I went home, took a shower, found out if anyone was going anywhere, and plopped down on to the computer...then decided that I might as well chill at my humble abode for the night, and take a day off from the chaos.&nbsp; So I'm gonna watch Gothika with the Papa and Brother tonight...it shall be fun!

      I woke up at 2:03 pm...I beat my old record by 19 minutes!&nbsp; And...It was unintentional!&nbsp; I woke up around 11, and my eyes were batting because of the bright sunlight that I just closed them...and fell asleep for 3 hours!&nbsp; Totally was just closing them to fix the contacts, and adjust to the light...yeah, or not!&nbsp; So when I dreamt and woke up 3 hours later...I hoped out of bed and walked down the stairs (almost fell down them...blood rush to the head!), and approached the mother who immediately said..."nice to see you up and raring to go this...afternoon!"  &nbsp;  So after I returned Nicoles phone call (that I missed...cause I was asleep), we headed on over Jared Cisz' Grad Party.&nbsp; It was at Bethesda Park, and we played on the Jungle Gym with his cousins, and Greg...who is eqivalent to a little kid, and swung on the swings.&nbsp; I hadn't done that in the longest time!&nbsp; After getting in touch with our childhood, Nicole and I went to her house- confronted the bitchy mother- and played some poker with the boys.&nbsp; Well, the poker game lasted about 30 minutes, cause the brownies we had made prior to the arrival of Drowsy Joe were done.&nbsp; The brownies, got more attention than the poker game...and the funny thing is...we ate the hole 9"x 11" pan.&nbsp; I didnt, but Pat and Joe did.&nbsp; After our laziness, and the brownies took hold of us, we sat...lathargick and dazed on the couch,&nbsp;trying to keep "drugged-up-sick Joe"&nbsp; ("drugged up=benadryl...nothing illegal!) awake!&nbsp; So...to repel the laziness, we headed outside to play some hoops!&nbsp; Then it got really humid, and we were getting extremely sweaty from running around, and we decided that it was time to head on home to get sleep for our big day tomorrow!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Thanks to Nicole and Pat, who decided that an 8:22 tee-time was good!&nbsp; Who the hell wants to get up that early to play golf...for fun!&nbsp; I can see getting up early to play in a tournament...but this is just 9 holes!&nbsp; ahh..should be a longer day than today!&nbsp; haha&nbsp; WOW, nicole and I have plans to do WAY TOO MUCH stuff tomorrow!&nbsp; Golf, lunch, Mountain Climbing, Bowling...hmm..I think 3 out of 4 will be done!&nbsp; Oh well, that shall be an interesting blog for tomorrow!  Good Night, cause I'm definitley tired..how?&nbsp; I dunno?&nbsp; I've only been awake for 10 hours!

      ...with my best friend!  &nbsp;  Well lets see, after my boys left around 1:45 last night, I hopped into bed, and woke up an eerie 15 minutes after my alarm went off...uh I could have been late to my meeting with the devil-the gift shop!&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn!&nbsp; Surprisingly after my 7 hours of sleep, I was ready and raring to go at work today!&nbsp; I don't think I have ever been so awake and alert at that job before!&nbsp; I definitely was working with  Nicole , and we recently-not always-but recently, have been getting along great at the gift shop!&nbsp; Its a good thing, when you have a lot in common with the person you're working with...It makes the shift go faster!&nbsp;  7.3 hours  of work with the one person who knows so much about you, is awesome, cause you're on the same level...You don't have to tell the whole story, you just pick up where you left off, and you don't have to explain...They just already know!&nbsp; Ahh...Sounds complicated, but its kind of nice!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So after Nicole and I laughed our asses off  (NB: "oh shit I just pushed the security button!," KH: "let's time um!" haha 6 seconds...pretty quick for a 60 year old!)  at her funny mannerisms, and our hard working job...or lack there of, we headed to Culvers!&nbsp;Today was the 20th anniversary of the franchise, and in lieu of that, they had $.84 butter burgers!&nbsp; Awesome!&nbsp; So we grabbed Joe, and headed over to get some cheap, all-American food!&nbsp; After that, Abby's house was Vacant for the Night so, like any other teenager, we hit that shit!&nbsp; haha&nbsp; We watched some Helen Keller movie (that abby was watching when we got there; hence had no say in the matter)&nbsp; and proceeded to receive my camera from Joe Jr's house.&nbsp; We hopped in to chit chat a while with the head of the household for the evening-Joe, and Matt.&nbsp; Then proceeded to be abby's bitch, and went to blockbuster to rent The return of the King; &nbsp;granted, this is the third time, in two days I have seen the inside of that store!&nbsp; I think they know me by name now!&nbsp; After Nicole and I moesied on over to the Snopek residence, after our rendezvous with the Finn Family,&nbsp;to our amazement, Brandon was over, playing some tunes with Brian on the Guitar.&nbsp; We made our way down to the dark and dreary basement, and popped in the final encounter of the famous trilogy, the party dwindled into 3--abby, Nicole, and myself of course!&nbsp; Kraus and Caleb came over about and hour and a half in to the epic tale.&nbsp; Oh well, I was on the computer the whole time...My miniscule imagination wouldn't allow me to be lost (haven't seen any of the LOTR...I know, I know, I'll get on that!).&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that I had six hours of fairytale-controversy told to me, in a total of 6 minutes by Abby (enough said), I don't think it was necessary for me to be asking questions the whole time!&nbsp; Ahh...time to chill with my awesome friends! &nbsp; Have a&nbsp;Some Good Sleep tonight everyone! &nbsp;

      Wow, couldnt have been a more interesting day!&nbsp; Woke up at 11 to hit the beach with Kelly; lets just say, thunderstorms were rollin' in, and we were stupid enough to actually want to go!&nbsp; So, we put our heads together and thought that if we were to just hit my grandmas house, and swim for a while in her pool, that if it did rain, we could run inside.&nbsp; So we were laying out in the sun, that was shadowed in the distance by some strengthening thunderstorms...we thought, we'd wait until it rained to go inside, to recieve the most sun possible, without being fryed--by lightning.&nbsp; So...we sat in the sun, watching as the edge of thin clouds approached the bright star, and...right as we thought the sun would be gone for the rest of the day...it seemed as though the clouds went in reverse!&nbsp; They moved away, and south.&nbsp; Couldn't have asked for a nicer hour and a&nbsp;half of laying out in the sun; watching as thunderstorms plummeted the west of us.&nbsp;  &nbsp; After our oiled up afternoon poolside, Kelly and I hit up Brookfield Square.&nbsp; I bought a pair of lounge pants at American Eagle, as Kelly shoveled out $70 at Charlotte Russe.&nbsp; My Pants we described by Caleb as "Smushed Peas-Green," doesn't he sound intelligent? &nbsp; After our rendevous at the mall, I went to the regional game, North vs. Kettle Moraine.&nbsp; Well...it was a game well played by everyone!&nbsp; Geis pitched an exceptional game, and Cal had a double play, but wasn't so successful at the plate!&nbsp; The game was tied 0-0 through 7 innings as it ended regulation.&nbsp; In the 8th inning, with a mix of horrible calls by the field umpire, Cal had a hit, but with no luck the inning ended with no one crossing the plate.&nbsp; As the bottom of the inning approached, the group i was with concluded that the umpires were bribed...by KM!&nbsp; They the most obvious out, safe!&nbsp; I was livid!&nbsp; NO WAY!&nbsp; I was watching from the 3rd baseline and I could see that he was soooo out!&nbsp; Fucking Umps, I swear it is their goal to fuck over North Athletics, be it, softball or baseball!&nbsp; This game related to our Sectional game, against West.&nbsp; We lost in the 8th inning.&nbsp; With runners on 1st and 2nd, the batter, who i think was the pitcher, hit a line drive past AJ at 2nd, and scored the runner at 2nd, thus ending the baseball season! &nbsp; After the distraught of the fact that I won't have anyone to cheer for the rest of the&nbsp;summer, Meyer and I decided that we wanted to chill later on tonight.&nbsp; So I hop on the phone, and invite people over to my house.&nbsp; For a while, it was just Nicole, Me, Greg and Jenny, then the couple left, and we waited for Brian and Kelly to arrive.&nbsp; Kel left for her boy toy (whom shall remain nameless) and brian went to the store with the innocent brother of mine, and Kevin.&nbsp; Around 12, Abby, Caleb, and Kraus arrived (attached at the hip of course), shortly followed, by the one-the only--AJ Garcia!&nbsp; I was surprised to say the least!&nbsp; But hey, hes definitley a cool guy, and I enjoyed his company. He was quiet, and cordial...compared to the rest of the testosterone in the room!&nbsp; Contra theme songs are still flowing through my mind right now! Damnit Kraus and Brian!&nbsp; AJ and I reminiced of our childhood...Northview Kindergarten!&nbsp; ahh...memories that i don't remember! lol&nbsp;&nbsp; AJ brought it up, I didnt even know he was in my class until an hour ago!&nbsp; wow thats funny!&nbsp; They all left around 1:45...to do nothing other than "pool hopping."&nbsp; Enough of that...especially when i walked out of the house and saw Caleb standing in the street naked--changing into his "pool hopping" gear.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So now its off to bed, cause Nicole waitd for me tomorrow at the Gift Shop, bright and early at 9:30...damn, thats in 7 hours!&nbsp; Wow...Gnite! &nbsp;

          Ahhh...I don't think i have ever slept in as late as I did today!&nbsp; 1:45!&nbsp; NUTS!&nbsp; Totally felt like i wasted my day!&nbsp; WOW  &nbsp;  Recieved my long awaited Room Assignment Today!&nbsp; Thank God!&nbsp; I'm in the Dorm I wanted:  Stevie, Room 103, 2 other roommates: Jessica and Melissa. &nbsp; Ahh.. Shall be fun!  &nbsp;  So did little in the 6 hours before heading over to Matt Pollack's House around 8:30.&nbsp; Wow...Poker night went...umm...Well?!&nbsp; Lets See...Nicole, Joe Jr., Sam, Angela, Justin, Matt and Myself, played some poka', until about 12:45.&nbsp; The elimination process went as follows: Sam, Angela, Nicole, Justin, Matt...ooh and your wondering why I'm not in those first four!?...Joe and I battled it out for about a half hour!&nbsp; I clearly had more chips from the get-go, so after i try to get the pot bigger...joe would fold.&nbsp; So this half hour consisted of fold after fold, or me winning every hand!&nbsp; Oh well...I prolly got lucky a couple times, due to trip 7's, two times in a row!!??&nbsp; I dunno, i thought that was pretty lucky!&nbsp; Ahh...it feels good to win!&nbsp; I took all 400 chips!&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; During this ordeal...Joe-who's allergic to cats- went home to get some benadryl...the drowsy kind!&nbsp; So...in order to keep Joe awake...we gave him some strong caffeinated drink name Mountain Dew..i dont know, i've never heard of it?!&nbsp; And...this apparently strong elixer, barely kept him awake.&nbsp; He played with his chips alot-to the point where it was annoying, but i didnt say anything cause he was half asleep-and gave away his chips alot too!&nbsp; I was seriously surprised that he was my opponent in the end, he should have been out cold 20 minutes after he took his "drugs?!"  &nbsp;  Overall, the day was pretty good, uneventful, but pretty good in a sense that I WON!&nbsp; hahahaha (evil laugh)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Goodnight All!&nbsp;

      Grad Party was a success!  11-5:30  Total people: 17  Woke up this morning to my mother walking into my room 3 minutes before my alarm was destined to go off(damn i hate that...i could have used the extra 3 minutes of sleep!), saying we need to go to the store, and the bank before we go to Grandmas!  hmmm...wow, that couldn't have waited an extra 3 minuts apparently!?    So we jetted off to Pick n' Save to pick up our favorite munchies, and i left to go to the grams to start setting up, and she went home to get the kids, I proceeded to then hop on the freeway.  Lets just say I put the car in Park in a 65 mph zone!!  I was sooo dumb!  DUH..President Bush was in town today, and the next exit on the freeway was blocked and guarded, because thats where the building was!!  'Smack me, i'm gonna be late to my own party!'  I parked to car, Cranked the music and sat there in an utter state of confusion as I wondered, why the fuck the interstate was in sheer gridlock...in Waukesha!?    Arrived in Elm Grove, at 10:54; i was 12 miles away, and it took me 56 minutes to get there!  GAY!  Set up the pool, got all the soda in the coolers, and pumped the jams.  And the first to arrived was Nicole around 11:30.  Shortly followed by many more of my fellow commerads!  And we partied it up in the poolio for a good while...got burned, and had raft races--made me feel like i was 6 again!  Surprisingly enough, the diving board was used ONCE!  by me!  Weird!?  Sarah--Fair skinned, orange haired Sarah--put on tanning oil!  hmm...shes a quick one!  She's really asking for melanoma early!  Lets just say, she had the most "defined" tan lines out of all of us!  I got burnt...slightly...just my cheeks really, otherwise, the pinkish tone on my bod should be gone by sunrise.  And right as we were packing up to leave, Adam Ludwig showed up, and he was like, "I'm sooo sorry, i tried as hard as i could to get out of work and get over here!"  so we talked a while, then raced home!! Not the greatest idea, when there's traffic...i dont advise!  During her stay at the humble aboad of the grandparentals, Nicole said that her bro had a basketball game around 7, and Ricciardi would be there!  WHAT???    RICCIARDI!?   "umm...is it ok, if Meyer, Amanda, and I come and watch "your brother?"  Or see Ricciardi really!!  Man it was blast just seeing him!  I told him that I was an official Psych major, and he said he was really proud of me, and that I will love it!  So we chatted it up with the "happily married man with kids", as my friends would say, for a while, and then we waved goodbye to sit down and watch the game.  But as i waved, ricciardi gave me the "come hither" finger motion, and said to me..."I have something to give you before you go to college, you'll like it, just make sure you dont leave for Edgewood without seeing me first!  It was great seeing you, haven't seen ya in a while!" in my head i'm thinking..."ahhhhhh i get to see him again!!!!!!!!!!!!"---not enough room for the necessary exclamation points!  So, then as i got up after the game to see him before i left, to arrange a time and place to recieve this unknown gift, he was gone!!  So, im making plans to go back next Wednesday to see him and talk!  haha  wow!  That was the highlight of the day...no the week, or month actually!  hahahahaha  After my knee-buckling confrontation with a man I adore for his personality and his love for people, Amanda and I headed off to our co-ed softball game!  We play with 29 year olds...and we're the youngest!  haha, so we played our game, and kicked arse!  Then we normally stay around and chat it up with the teammates.  So amanda and i always seem to talk to Todd.. who i think is the most attractive atually, and the best player on the team!  So we talked for a while, and made fun of eachothers problems in the outfield tonight, and we found out some interesting information about him!  He was a '95 graduate of Waukesha North!! No freakin' way!?  I thought that was sooo cool!  anyways...!  I've gushed about numerous men tonight!  Well, they were all fun stories actually!  Time to go to bed, definitley was a better day than last!  NO drama!  haha

      Wow, so the RWK concert I was talking about before was entertaining to say the least, but I just didnt feel the vibe from the band!  Tony...of course, is always the center of anntetion wherever he goes, and hes hystarical to watch, but Greg is soo fake when he's up there!  Jenny was even embarrassed by him!  He just makes gay comments when they arent necessary, and ruins Tonys monologue!  Damn Greg!  And the Amps were on SOOOOOO high that you could barely understand the words mumbling out of Tony's Mouth!   So when the Concert finally ended, Nicole got a call from Kevin..."come to Gelatos!"  So she grabs me and we head on over to Divine Gelatos...the best Italian Ice Cream Place in town...well the only Italian Ice Cream Place in our tiny town!  We sit down and start devouring our international flava...and we make conversation.  I'm the conversation maker, even if I don't know the people very well, like in this situation!  Its Kevin, Nicole, Me, (kevins friends) Adam, Mike and Kelly.  Kelly, I knew from Middle School so i was chatting it up with her, and then Kevin and I started talking about golf, and then their friend Steve Mack shows up with his friend, Brendo, or Brenno..i dunno.  I know steve from Middle school as well, and this Brenno Character that I have seen at golf tournaments last summer.  So the golfers are talking...about golf, madison, tennis...and I'm trying to get Nicole into the conversation but she couldn't stay in it for very long.  I was comfortable with the situation, but i think thats where Nicole and I are different.  I can make conversations and she can't.  I knew she was uncomfortable when she started to laugh.  But I know that sounds weird, but I think they were "uncomfy" laughs; laughs to get her heard.  I guess I really dont know what shes feeling.  But after we left the guys and the south boys, we headed over the ginny's where she immediately asked me..."what did you guys talk about when you were walking back to the cars?" "he asked me what car was mine," and I described it as "the black Ford Escort ZX2, with the Titleist Hat rockin' the back shelf."  Then I got in the car.  Her immediate response was..."He likes you, and I'm fine with that."  Riiiiight!!  Sure!  I dont like him like that...He would be a cool golf buddy!  Thats all!  I dont understand her.  If you want to get his attention, you have to talk to HIM, and not be shy about the situation.  I didnt really talk much there once I think about it, i was just listening to their convos, and chiming in with my own comments here and there.  I hope she doesn't hate me, I don't mean to, its not like I can stop talking to people, its just my nature!   So at Ginny's we hopped in the door, and Nip/Tuck ended, and everyone left, it kinda sucked.  But then Abby was talking to Nicole outside, and I go out there to talk to them, and Abby's like..."Kaitlyn can you go inside for like 10 minutes cause I need to talk to nicole without you here?"  OMG can you say fucking High School Drama everyone?!  Holy mother of God!  Abby told me the other day that she needed to go up to LaCrosse to get her picture taken and that Kelly needed to too!  So she wanted to drive up, take the picture and come back.  Kelly on the other hand, wanted to stay at her campground, instead of driving 6 hours in one day.  So i was having a conversation with Kelly, and she was talking about this, and I said, oh Abby kind of wanted to come home right after so she could do some stuff with friends and just be home.  And Kel was like oh really?  Thats all, and i think she said to abby that I had told her that she said she wanted to come home.  And I got bitched out because "I need to think before I speak because it might hurt her feelings!"  Holy crap, its not like Im lying or something, and its not like its a big deal at all!  holy shit, why tell something youre not!  "oh kelly i'll sleepover, sure, even tho i really dont want to!"  I dont understand!  Tell People How You Really Feel!  I can't fucking wait til College!! All the drama will be gone, why can't everyone just be civil about stupid shit?!   WOW i have rambled on, about my gay night!  WOW, i think the last person i want to see right now is obvious, shes become so crabby since she started her new 9-6 job!  And lots of people have noticed too!  WOW, i dont care if people read this!  This is how I feel at the moment, and my opinions of people change all the time...so no need to get all huffy and puffy if i'm complaining about people, thats my fore-warning!  I was pissed tonight, and I just wanted people to read that!

      My day was sooo eventful yesterday, that I was soo tired to write about it when i got home...so this blog is to write about yesterday and today!   Yesterday:  Woke up and rapidly hopped in the car (to escape from having to clean), to head to the Grandma's to get some rays and Swim. After I got a call from Vicki saying that there was a doubleheader baseball game of North vs. West that started at 4, I rushed home to take a shower, to not smell so chlorified, andended up getting to West right on time! It was perfect timing on my part! thank you, thank you!   Watched the Northstar Boys lose their first game 9-4, and needless to say I had little hope for the second game. The second game was 4000 times better than the previous. Better pitching (AJ Garcia pitched 6 and 1/2 innings), better contact, and better defense! It was like a whole other team! West had like 3 different pitchers! It was ridic! But Caleb had an awesome hit in the 5th inning! I'll take you back...Bases loaded, no outs, and they bring in a new pitcher, one that throws extreme side arm and bends over when he throws...it was a hoot! The first pitch this new guy throws, Cal hits it to the fence...about 6 ft short of a home run! So he had a 3 run, double! It definitely got the crowd up and awake, as we took a comfortable lead of 9-3. We ended up winning 13-7, it was a great game!   So after 5 hours of sitting on my deriere, i got up to join the friends at AMF for $1 bowl! So I thought it was gonna be like...10 people max, ummm...NO! there were soo many people bowling, not bowling, people that just came to say hi! I mean there were at least 45 people there at 1 time! it was Crazy! Some people that came that I didnt think would be there...Kevin Gamms, and Ryan Andrews. Nicole Invited them! Then we proceed to play 2 games, and it got late and many people went home, but Kevin invited Nicole and I to his house to go "hot tubbing" with him and ryan. I was game! Nicole was soo funny, she was like, I being asked to sit with a hot man half naked...what do i do? I laughed soo hard, i think she thought i was being mean! GO!!   So we went to Kevins, I already had the swim suit in the car, from Ginny's so we stopped at Nic's and she got hers...then proceeded to the Golfers house. We get there and hop in the tub...HOT!!! Holy Moley! it was soo hot, and it was humid out, so it made it so easy to get light headed! After about 5 minutes in the luxurious hot tub, we hopped out to go run in the yard and get cooler. We sat down and chilled in the grass for a while as we caught our breath! wow, it was soo warm! After a while inside, we went home around 1:30! Wo we had a fun time!   Today:  Woke up around 9...thats the first time in a while that I did that! and got ready to Zoo it up with Nicole and Amanda! Wow, I hadn't been to the Zoo in like 5 years! It was definitley a fun time! We took lots of pictures and got lots of sun...maybe too much! But at the end of our elementary field trip, our legs were like jello, and we were soo tired from walking about 6 miles, and sitting down once...on the train!! hell yeah! i felt like i was 6 again!   Now im off to the RWK concert to see Tony entertain us... then the plans will flow from there! Adios Amigos!

      Ahh...Its such an amazing movie!  I cried...again!    Joe, Nicole and I went to see it at Point tonight, and Nicole and I balled...again, and Joe admitted to getting teary eyed.  Wow, the end just gets you!  Oh boy, so sweet!  Not to mention the HOTT sex scenes!  WOW  I partied hardy at Nicole's Block party tonight--party hardy as in chillin with people I dont know...and the Beauchenes!  So, we ate, drank soda, and watched as massive thunderstorms rolled in!  They were the frightning ones: the billowing coulds, the blushed sky, and the increase in wind speed!  And there was a tornado warning in the county over! hmm...spelled disaster!  Well it certainly didnt stop us from seeing our movie did it?!  Well these seemingly disasterous thunderstorms fizzled, and they brought us some minor, static electricity showers...eh!  Entertaining for about 5 minutes!  But they also SOAKED us as we ran the 60 feet from the car to the theater!  I was drenched!    At the end of the Night...I was kind of glad that the Three of us went together!  I like the small group attractions!  And Joe's a Great guy, and Nicole's the best friend, so I like hanging with them--plus you can always cry with your best friend!  We already have plans to watch The Notebook together during Christmas Break.  That shall be fun!  Tomorrows plans go like this:  Get the Transcripts turned in before the Thursday Deadline, clean the house (eh fun!), and proceed to go bowling around 9ish!    Off to beddy bye---talk to ya'll tomorrow!

      Wow, its kinda depressing going to so many of those grad parties.  Makes me realize that all of my friends will be leaving soon.  oh so sad.  But i did find out that Kate is moving to madison before school...so if i ever feel homesick, i can chill with David P, and Linda!  It shall be fun!   The day was fun! I went to Vicki's Grad party at Pebble Valley, and when i walk in...I look at nicole, and see that she's wearing the same outfit as me...unplanned!  Blue halter top, khaki shorts, and our baby blue adidas sandals!  It was sooo weird, we had people asking us at each party, if we had planned out outfits...NO!  After vick's party we headed to joe's partay!  It was fun, we played some volleyball, and some hold 'um, and we watched Old School!  Cool Night!  It was funny...Joe's Intimidated by me!  hahaha oh well...apparently I was "too attractive" to talk to in High School, and that when we were placed in the same Psych class...i had to speak first-you wuss!  Thats ok, i got a really cool friend out of it!  It just took us a while to speak to one another! hehe..Go Joe! haha  Man I really want to find out my roommate for college...this is getting ridiculous, everyone else is constantly talking about their roommates, and im so left out!  lol, oh yeah and i have 6 days to turn in my transcripts...uhh, im getting scared!  I dont like seeing my guidence councelor!  oh well, if its needed, i guess so!   Ahh...off to watch the Count of Monte Cristo!  Damn good movie! As my intimidated friend Joe would say:   Have a Good One Everyone!

      North WON!!!   10-5!  Holy Cow, Arrowhead Sucks when they don't have Tim Hoy pitching!  Today they pitched 6, count um, 6 pitchers!  It was nuts! Caleb went 3x4, and hit 2 doubles!  It was a cool game!  Geis pitched a very good game, had a couple 3rd out, strike-outs!  Great game, especially cause they beat Arrowhead...for the second time this season!  Awesome...just plain awesome!    The game was followed by a night at Kevin's House!  Not a bad choice.  Steve Olenchek came over to chill with us, havent seen that boy in a long time, but it was nice to see his always smiling face!  Kate, Kevin, Steve, Sam, Brian and I were chillin' together.  But i couldnt stand a few of um!  Oh well, cant pick and choose your friends!  Cal and Kraus were supposed to come over, but Caleb bailed cause he was sleepy and has a Doubleheader tomorrow.  And Kraus was with the "wife."  enough said! Now I'm planning on what to do tomorrow...hmmm...baseball game, then "anchorman,"  then prolly chillin' like villans!!

      Well the weather sucked today!  It's Chilly, and rainy...WTF, its July!   So I worked with Nicole today at the Gift Shop, and we were talking about visiting our friend who's in the hospital and bringing her a card. So I go and ask the lady at the front desk what rom shes in.  And it was confidential!  Totally Gay...if people want to bring her flowers and cards, they can't unless they talk to the parents.  Thats stupid! I'm not gonna call them up and talk to them...I barely  know them!  So we're gonna talk to the b/f and see if he knows what room she's in.  Prolly, plus she'll be there for a while so I suppose we're not in a rush.  Ahh...now I'm off to watch some hot boys play baseball; should be fun! haha, North vs. Arrowhead...enough said!  Oh yeah speaking of the north baseball team...Tony Memmel was in the Freeman today!  He was interviewed because he plays baseball with only one arm!  The article kicked ass, and I thought it was awesome seeing one of my good friends finally get recognition for something so unique...he totally deserved it!  The man's beenin everything, and I dont think he's ever gotten any props for it!  Oh well, hope he plays well today! As Joe would say:  Have a good one Everyone!

      Ummm...I suck at Halo!    Definitly suck horribly at Halo!  Caleb, Kraus, Liz, Kevin, Brian and I chilled at Kraus's Dad's House and played some Halo.  Yeah, I've played Halo, let alone Xbox, 3 times, twice at Caleb's, and the third being today...meaning: I'm just learning how to control the camera angle!  That's what fucks me up! I'm used to the ghetto N64, where the you use your left hand to control the joist stick, yes i know you use your left thumb on the xbox controller, but the camera angle isnt controlled by that tho! Thats like asking me to rub my belly and pat my head...its hard!  So we played that for a while. The most kills i had was 4...says alot!  Then, for the second time today, I had Caleb tell me that girls are inferior to men when it comes to sports. ok w/e, i dont even want to get into that...it would take forever to write!  So I just went over to him and slapped the back of his head, and said..."well at least we win conference championships." and he shut up cause he's never been on a winning team before...and I'm not kidding!  hahaha, ownage! Dick!    So now i'm typing up this after a long drive home from kraus's dad's, and being the only one on the road!  Ok time for beddy bye!  gnite everyone!

      Oh my god, mark this day in the books!  The Brewer's, who are 44-38, swept the Chicago Cubs!  Holy Shit!  I found that amazing!  Too bad we didnt catch a game!  Man, the fact that I can say to Kevin, "the cubs lose, cubs lose," in my best Harry Caray expression, just to piss him off, is enough for me!  hahahaha  So today was semi interesting! Chilled with the Bro the majority of the day.  We went CD shopping at Target, with the youngen purchasing "the Beautiful Letdown," by Switchfoot (awesome group).  I reached for the Notebook Soundtrack.  I wanted a CD to relax to.  This music is perfect for a laid back day.  Its all instrumental music from the '40's, its pretty damn cool!  and the fact that it made me cry in the theathers, means that I can listen to it all the time.  not to cry to, but to be reminded of the freakin' awesome movie! hahaha.   Softall Game @ 6...um i definitly didnt dress for the weather!  Umm..the last time i checked it was July 7th!  I thought that sweatshirts and sweatpants were required now a year!?  But the game was awesome, spite the chilly temps!  I was 3x3, with 3 doubles!  that's freakin' awesome! And I got made fun of hardcore, as I'm rounding first and almost fell!  Blame the pants! they're a large, and when i run, they brush together and get stuck! haha, you have to see it in person!  But, none the less, I was safe!  Cause I'm soo damn quick!  Now I'm chillin' at home, waiting for Caleb to call me up to see what we're doing tonight!  I'm out!

      Wow, where has Sex in the City been in the last 7 years!  Crap!  Nicole, Kate and I ( aka: The Three Amigos) watch the whole first season tonight!  Holy Shit, the acting was hystarical, and the it hit the nail right on the head!  The writing was phenomenol! I dont think I've seen a funnier show in my life.  The whole time the three of us are sitting there, deciding which sex-feined character we act like!  Well it was so blatenly obvious that Kate is Miranda, the lawyer/liberal/sarcastic sexaholic( well...minus the fact that all of us are virgins, so the whole sex thing is wrong!) Nicole is Charlotte York, the naive, less sexed, iffy of the whole one night stand situation, sex kitten, that goes for the tall, dark and handsome.  And I, well, we couldn't decide!  Sometimes we thought that I would be considered as Samantha, the sex kitten, that makes sex with a different guy a daily event. Except the part where I dont do that, Then we decided that I have the flirtatious abilities of Samantha, and not the SEX part.  That I am Carrie really, as a full character with the flirtatious abilities of Samantha! there ya go! Ahh the night was a blast, great "bonding" time!  haha nothing like cheese-its and raisinets in a 5 hrs period! Ahh havent eaten "real" food since lunch time! We talked about boys, what goes down at Nip/Tuck nights, and Ricciardi!  haha...Wow time for bed!  It's been a long day!  Goodnight

      Hahaha, so I woke up this morning and joined Kate,Kevin and his brother, Mike at Grandview Park to play some slow pitch.  Mike's Friends came to join us too, along with Caleb and Kraus...lets just say, the graduated seniors of 2004 Kicked Ass!  WOW there was no competition!  Haha, we played for 3 hours!  It didnt seem that long!  We must have played like 20 innings!  So we were invited to the cook out at The Davis Household afterward...but I came to the conclusion that my stomach hurt too much to go and eat cook out for the second night.  I think I have acute food poisoning from last night at Kate's House, nothing major, just a stomach ache.  Oh well, I can still eat, I'm good then!  So tonight, Kate, Nicole and I are watching some Sex and the City, and just chillin.  A girl's night persay.  Hahaha, I'm watching the Cubs/Brewers game...we won! Cubs Lose, Cubs Lose!

      Wow, another extremely boring day in the eyes of Kaitlyn!  Well, lets see...started off the day, by waking up too late to watch the Federer/Roddick final match up-that pissed me off!  I definitley was in the mood to watch some hott men battle it out in a sweaty, muscle-aching, moaning and groaning after every shot-tennis match! Damn, I guess the overview had to do!  Oh Well, the US Open's in 2 months... I can drool over Andy Roddick then!  So then as I sat in agony, watching the overplayed match of Sharapova vs. Williams( for the 4th time thank you) I decided, "wow, its 3:00 in the Afternoon, guess I should get movin on with the day."  Now as I hop in the shower, the father is breathing down the neck about us being to the grandmas on time (god, like it's worth seeing the 24 cousins for the second day in a row...uhh NO), saying, "hurry up kaity...we're leaving in ten minutes without you if you dont hurry up!"  God in my head I'm thinking..."does he not remember that he bought me a car in febuary so I could drive myself places, and waste my own gas...why the hell are they waiting for me, I'll drive myself for Christ Sake!"  So as I told him that that black little escort out there is mine, and I will meet them there, he kind of looked at me with this dumbfounded face- this face that you could read so well- that had the expression of...oh my god thats right, my daughter totally just told me off, and she was right!  God I love that!  So I arrived a half hour after they did, to the white house on Church St., and said hello to grandma, whom I saw 18 hours prior to this greeting, and moved on inside to hang with the 2 oldest kids there-my brother and my sister!  No Joke! I'm 17, Bro's 14, and the Sis is 12.  Wow, I could've done that at home!  Almost worth the waste of Gas!  Of Course, we're the first ones there, even with all the hassle before, of "hurry up, we're gonna be late," so we sit...and watch T.V...(can't go outside, its raining)...and we find a movie on HBO, ah...OLD SCHOOL!  Nothing says Independence Day, like Will Ferrell's Ass!  Well as I sit, watching it for the second day in a row, with the father and uncles telling me, (the oldest remember), to get out of the room during the blow job scene, i stare off to space thinking...My freshman brother is sitting right next to me, he's younger, why the hell am I getting told to leave?!  God, I just keep telling myself...2 months, just 2 more months and I'm gone!   So I left the house, a good 2 hours after I arrived, and found my friends, whom were waiting to grill out with me before the fireworks.  We cooked some amazing hamburgers and weiners at kate's House, cause the parentals weren't home...wow, dont leave Kate alone with a match and a grill...she would most likely blow herself up, she almost did!  then we attempted to watch the fireworks at the church on Madison...but it was sooo damn buggy and wet, that we stayed for like 10 minutes! Oh well!  Then the head ache kicked in...Damn allergies!  I fucking hate the Mold!  Gets my head stuffed up, and it poundin'! Ah..the exciting part of tomorrow should be the 12 o'clock softball game with Kevin's Brother, Mike, and his Firends.  Who should include...Andy Latus, Derek D'Amico, Mike davis (of course), shit, this should be a hott game!  Like 25 hot guys who are 3 years older!  Hell Yeah bitches!  hahahaha  kate and I are gonna be in LaLa land!  Oh my god, and greenman should be there too!  HAHAHA  what a blast!  Ok, well that was my semi active day! maybe it'll be a bit more interesting tomorrow...wink!

      Wow, the day couldnt have been more boring!  Spent the day at my Grandma's to celebrate my grandpa's birthday(note: my grandpa's dead). At this Annual Event, we swim, and see people you're related to, that you dont know exist!  Well,the day started off by swimming, and then we moved inside when it started raining (damn rain), coincidentally, the relatives from san diego, minnesota, and illinois, came at the same time! FUN! (sense the sarcasm everyone?!)  About 50 people just chillin in a house made for 13! whatever!  yeah, you get my drift, i could feel the the person next to me breathing- it was that packed!  wow, then with the need to escape the thick walls of the '67 threshold, nicole called to save the day!  "Come over to Joe's House...we're playing poker." "I'm All In."  So i bolt out that door and hop in the car, and realize, where the hell does joe live!  haha  After finding the house, we play some hard core poker.  Me, Lili, Nicole, Joe, and Pat.  Shortly joined by Dan, joe's brother.  I, of course, was done first.  But i definitley saved myself a couple times thanks to about 6 lucky straights I had!  hell yes!  As the night moved on, the afternoon sun drained me and forced me to retreat to my humble abode. Talked online for a while to Adam, and Joe...then to Brian Dziewa...that was weird! Oh well, gotta be nice to everyone i guess!  Got to Keep the Positive Attitude! LOL Hard Core!

      Wow, another summer, another John Mayer Concert!! Unbelievable!  Maroon 5 opened for him, and they kicked ass too!  The fact that I knew every song of both bands, totally made the experience even better...I can sing along the whole time!! Favorite Song that Maroon 5 played--tie between Shiver and Sunday Morning, Favorite John Song played--three-way tie between Only Heart, Something's Missing, and New Deep! Also am the proud owner of a Maroon 5 t-shirt, and a John Mayer sweat band, those were a must!!  I was the "waitress" at the t-shirt stand, I took abby, amanda, jenny's "orders" up there, and about $110 later, I was hated by about 35 other girls, cause I took forever!  oh well, tall, blonde fans need their merchandise too!  Ahh, also got a tattoo there too!  A Henna One!!  haha almost fooled ya!  Its awesome, nicole, kate and I got star ones on our back!  So after meeting up with the crew, we headed to our designated seats, and awaited the arrival of the unbeknownst, DJ Logic.  yeah, probably the gayest thing we saw all day! This guy spinning some records, and playing the most god aweful music before a john concert- rap, and rock mixer!  Horrible!  WEll its off to bed now.  After a long day, its time for some sleep! Happy Birthday Pops!

      9 Hours!!!!  Wow, cant wait!  I'm going with Nicole and Kate, and Amanda and Abby are in other seats.  This is gonna kick ass!  Maroon 5 is opening for him, that should be amazing too!  I'm going to the pool, to relax, and get lightly crisp before the show.  I think i'll call up nicole and see if she wants to go with!  Funniest thing ever: Kate's afraid to drive to the concert because she got in a fender bender, and her hood got pushed up.  And i'm not the person to take the Bus- not a fan of drunk people throwing up on the bus- So I told her I would drive, and shes all paranoid! She's afraid of the drunk people on the road, but let me tell ya, there's always drunk people on the road, you just dont know it. Just because Summerfest is going on, doesnt mean there's any more drunk people driving!  All the people that would normally go to the bars, are at summerfest! It'll be fine I dont see the problem in it!?  oh well.  Off to get tan!

      Hey Guys, its my first post!  I got this idea from Joe...just chillin' and writing about the day you had!  In a way to remember what you did over the Summer!  So Today, July 1st, I saw Spiderman 2!  haha, awesome movie!  If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly suggest!  Then I proceeded to "sun-bathe" at my grandma's pool, certainly was worth the melanoma!  After a well deserved time to chill without the annoying brothers and sisters, I opted to attend Sarah's Birthday Party! eh...not bad, but no one really showed up, and I kinda was sleepy...you know how you can react to all the sun exposure from the afternoon!  wow, sure did make me sleepy!  So I can home and sat on the couch checking my email, to see if my friend from edgewood, emailed me back! tough luck, no response yet.  His name's Tom Klien, hes a "cool cat," from Hiawatha, Iowa.  I know the thought going through your mind-why the hell would you come to edgewood from Iowa?- well, he really liked the school, and the surroudings, I suppose thats a ligit reason. oh well, he was a really cool guy to meet right off the bat at registration! haha, thats my first "blog", see you tomorrow!

      Took the Day off!  Easy as that!  Woke up kind of late, but needed some sleep after a couple days of getting up early for golf related events!  So my whole day kind of revolved around two things: My nose, and Hurricane Charley!  My Nose:  Well for a while, my nose has been funky; with allergies every-now-and-then, and today... it was extra retarded!  My right nostril (in case anyone cares) was stuffy, so I was breathing out of one nostril for the whole day... thats annoying as hell!  So the question crossed my mind a couple times if I had a cold, or was just having a ridiculous reaction to the ragweed!? I sure hope it is allergies, for more than one reason!  wink!   Hurricane Charley:  Well, if you have been watching the news the last two days, you would know about the powerful cyclone churning in the Gulf of Mexico.  Well, my grandma, who lives in Fort Myers, Florida, has been hunkered down in a Hurricane Shelter for the last 48 hours, and we have heard nothing from her since.  I know that sounds a little scary, but the one thing we're more worried about is her apartment, on the beach of Fort Myers.  See, Fort Myers was in the direct path of the eye of the storm; Thus, packing the strongest winds, and the heaviest storm surge--up to 18 feet!  We aren't concerned about her safety, because we know she's in a shelter that can withstand winds of 200 mph, but more her stuff on the beach front property!  The fact that the storm surge is possible of excessing 18 feet... that could completely submerge the whole apartment!  Therefore, ruining all of her furniture, appliances, and pictures.  The power generated Hurricane Hall, is holding 1500 people, that live in the Neighborhood... sounds a little packed to me?  I don't know about you, but I'd be going nuts!  But original plans were supposed to go as follows:  Brewer Game with the girls, Nicole, Amanda and Kate.  But due to my sinus problems that were making me crabby, and kleenex addicted, and the southern typhoon... I decided to cancel on my best friends, to relax, and let the stress of going, going, going, escape!  So, I did some laundry, to see how much laundry I could possibly take to Edgewood with me in 16 days.  Well, during that fiasco of cleaning the room, and actually doing the laundry... I was taking my pastel clothes out of the dryer, and I found a cap a of berry blistex, sitting on the lint catcher.  In my mind I'm freaking out... thinking...  Shit that better have just been a cap that accidentally gotten in there; the whole tube hopefully isn't in there!?  So, as I take out the clothes... I see this pink/greasy stain on my Marquette University Shirt.  So right now I am officially freaking out!  That this was my biggest load of laundry, with all my favorite clothes, and the possibility of all of them being covered with greasy, pink stains was making me sooo upset!  So I take them all out and go upstairs... where I immediately start balling!  All of my clothes, some of which were pretty expensive, others were sweatpants, and t-shirts, were spotted with the moisturizing lip balm!  I was having a "kiniption" as my mother would call it!  I was freaking out earlier about the cost of my textbooks, and now the fact that my clothes were ruined, left me with the thought of  oh my god, I'm not going to have any money to buy new clothes now! Cause all my clothes are RUINED!   So, I took one of my crummier shirts, and tried a grease remedy on it.  So, I took the SHOUT and rubbed it... and it came out!!!  So... for the next 2 and a half hours, I took all of my clothes downstairs to the laundry room, and made all of that lip blam disappear!   A little stressful... but I definitley got some well needed chores done!  But, tomorrow should be some what interesting!  I work with Nicole for 7.3 hours!  Man, spending that long with her at work makes it go so fast!  Because, as apposed to working with someone you dont really know, you work with your best friend, who you can laugh your ass off with for 7 hours, while listening to the radio, and eating chocolate!  (By far the only thing I'm gonna miss from that job--the free chocolate!)  But after our day inside, tending to sick peoples family members, we're gonna hang with all the buds, and have one grand ol' time!  Should be blog worthy!   But, Hey!  Off to bed!  I need to get up early again tomorrow morning!  Damn it!  I suppose I need to get a little used to it! OK, g'nite my fellow readers!

       urlLink    It was a 1:35 start for the amazing Phil Mickelson today... the man never seems to strike me as less than amazing! So Kevin and I watched the WHOLE coverage of Phil's First round from 1:30- 7:00... and proceeded with our night! Which included Taco Johns, Goodwill, Best Buy (wow those are like polar opposite stores), and a mummy making contest! Yeah that's right, a mummy making contest! After our trip to the stores, we headed over to Frame Park to walk around, and apparently on Thursday Nights, its "family flicks" night... where they play some movie on a huge screen in the Amplitheater. They also have little contests, like, Mummy Contests... So we completed with another couple, and two sets of kids, and we lost... (B.S.) we should have taken first! Damn older couple... I was flying around Kevin, Mummying him up so fast, it was nuts! But, i got dizzy, and we lost!  So then after our fun redezvous around the City of Waukesha... we joined Amanda and Nicole at Nicoles house to watch "The Ring," certainly a movie I hadn't seen in a while!  So that was a blast, and spending more and more time with everyone in the last few days has made me realize how much I'm gonna miss um... even after all the fights, and arguements, and such, I am geniuinely gonna miss everyone!  Can't wait till Minnesota... get to chill with my other friends, and go the the Mall of America!  Amen to that!  So, can't wait til vacations, and football games (college style!), and all of the funny ass conversations long distance on the tele!  Ahh... college is coming soon...whether we like it or not!   Goodnight All!  p.s.:  Root for Phil!  Mickelson All the way bay-beh!

       urlLink    Welcome to Whistling Straits... Where we bring Ireland to you!  Man could have been the most fun of the summer!  My dad, Gunner, Kevin and I went to Haven to watch some PGA golf!  That was amazing!  The course has the striking resemblance of St. Andrews, and a the features of Irish Courses... All in Wisconsin on the shores of Lake Michigan!

      Ok so the day was a blast!  I went with Kate, and my friend Tom from Edgewood, and his friend BJ, to the Dave Matthews Band Concert.  It was great!  We we over-estimated our time of arrival so we ended up getting pretty damn good seats... unintentionally!  So, lawn seats were nice... until everyone and their mom started to cram in next to us!  There was an estimated 100,000 people stuffed into Alpine Valley!  That was crazy!  Sooo many people tokin' up, I probably got Second Hand High!  Kate and I felt so relaxed and everything was glourious!  Well since we had never smoked before, I guess I really dont know what its like!  But, we thought we were!  Lots of Beer was spilled on us, and lots of dumb girls!  But overall the music was good, I wanted  Dave  to play Satellite, but he never did!  Sad!  And I got to meet BJ, who is a very attractive man, with 3 tattoos, and is a constrution contractor... at 18!  WOW  So, I met a new friend, got closer to another, and introduced a Madisonite- to a Madisonite!  Fun stuff! The journey out of the parking lot was adventurous, scary, bitchy, and food filled!  So, whoever thought that parking cars in 3 car rows was a smart idea.... should be shot immediately!  So, of course, we were in the middle, so we had to wait for a car to leave in front or behind us!  Sucked! so when we did get out, there were these bitchy girls who wouldn't pick up their lawn chairs and move 10 ft. to let 3 cars go through!  Bitches, Tom called them *the C-Word*  and I thought their drunk asses were gonna attempt to kick ours!  So, a total of an hour, and some hamburgers later, we were out of the parking... lawn.  So, the rest of the trip was pie and we got home around 12:30... Where I instantly hopped in the shower to clean off all the beer, smoke, and grass.  Wow, I have never felt so clean and refreshed after an event before!  Amazing!  So, although the music was ok, my first experience to Alpine Valley was something I will never forget!  First time I had ever seen anyone toke up in public!  Wow, thats weird! And first time to ever feel the effects of Pot... by inhaling everyones exhale!  Not cool!  So, being the only 4 people NOT fucked up, we definitely got to know eachother better, enjoyed the music, and laughed at everyone passing out, and wasted in the amplitheater!   Definitely A day I will never forget!  8-8-04  Dave Matthews Band!  Off to sleep!  g'nite  ;o)

      Alfalfa...or Spanky!?  Haha...well, haven't written in a while, but yeah, didn't really miss much though!  A couple All Girl Nights, and Work...same old, same old.  But today was a 'lets write" worthy!  So, this morning I was supposed to wake up at 7:15 and be at Butler Fields at 8:00.  I also had to pick up Luter, and get at the Umpiring Job on time!  Well... If you know me well, you'd realize by now, that I didnt get there on time...nor did I wake up before I was supposed to be there!  So, luckily Kate called at like 8:10, and I had enough time to get up, put on shorts and a shirt, and head out the door... surprisingly getting there 6 minutes after I woke up!  Thats good time!  So, myself being a little groggy, and a bit on the hungry side, I made it in time for the first game that started at 8:45.  These games were fun!  Kate, Eisenach, myself, and Erin from South, umped 2 different games.  This tournament was U-9 and U-11 Girls Blazers... It was cute! There were some good girls on the teams... but there also were your fair share of bad ones--who had crabby parents attached at their hips!  I called out a girl, who was on base, for leading off before the ball was released, and I had her mom on my ass, saying, "What was that?" "They haven't done that all year and NOW you call them out?"  "Jeez they're just 11 yrs old!"  And my response was "Its in the rules, No leading off before the ball is released!" Then I waved the rules around so she could see...and she replied with: "Well it would be nice if we got those once in a while!"  So...First of a couple bad encounters at my 6 Hour stay at the Butler Diamonds!   That sucked!  6 hours of standing, walking, getting bitched at, bending over at the waist to pick up balls that rolled by... WOW!  That was somehow... tiring!  But got $25 out of it...so I guess thats more than what I had before the day started!   So, in the midst of this three game rucous.... Kevin had been trying to reach me...but...I was umpiring--so it made it a little hard to get back to him!  So we planned to go hit the range around 6...and then see where it would take us from there!  Well, we explored all over Waukesha County!  So the range at Willow was fun, and I hit the ball mediocre...but hey!  So then we decided that Pizza would be delish...but where?!  Apparently he had some place in mind... Albanese's.   Had never been there before, and we chowed down and had a grand ol' time!  after our dinner on the porch, we headed on over to the mall... to walk around...and the only store we went into...was Hot Topic!  Thats wierd!  So, with my amazing genious, I had the idea of hittin' the caffeine!  Starbucks!  He had only been there once!  No one can die before going to Starbucks... It's just one of America's great Attributes!  Damn... Tall Caramel Frappacino!  And a Strawberries n' Creme for the young man!  Well as we devoured our Caffeinated Desserts, we kept naming off movie lines... some great ones from Scarface, Super Troopers, and of course-- Tommy Boy!  Wow, cant go a day without accidentally, or purposely saying a line from the great film!   "Richard...Who's your favorite Little Rascal?  Alfalfa...or Spanky?!"  As Tommy finds Richard whackin it to the "hot" girl in pool.   "I wonder if she goes out with one of the Yankees!?"   "I wouldn't Know!"-- says Richard.  Wow,  like I needed to keep going in this "monologue," everyone knows it!  But hey, thats what we did all night!  It was a great time! So after his second trip to Starbucks, we headed back to Legs' household to p-l-a-y some video games.  Goldeneye007, for the one, the only, Nintendo 64!  The original 3D Package!  So...I officially suck!  I thought I might have a chance, seeming as though I had played it alot with the bro...but No!  I sucked that game up!  And we retreated to some normal everyday cable television!  I introduced him to the movie, "Indecent Proposal."  Man, its Robert Redford being a Shady, Creepy old man who wants some sex from Demi Moore!  Eww...But good plot!   Then I came home!... And almost forgot my clubs in his car! But I didn't!  So tomorrow... WOW!! Should be a grand ol' Time!  Dave Matthews Band Concert in East Troy, with Tom, BJ, and Kate... Damn, can't wait for the second hand Pot!  Just Joshin!  Guten Tag ( shit that means Good Day!)

      So, you know how I was hoping it was going to be cancelled last night!? Well the Best Ball tournament wasn't, it was up and running at 7:15! The fact that I had to drag myself out of bed at 6:15 in the first place, was enough alone for complaint! So, this tournament consists of members, who are all over 50 or 60, inviting 3 guests to play a best ball. So these ladies, are the socialite elite! The snobby, trophy wives who didn't know what golf was until they married the rich man and said..."oh! I will play golf there honey...can you teach me?!" Oh man its a scene right out of The Stepford Wives... they are the worlds perfect, non-working, bimbos! So... then round in general, was pretty damn good! The whole round I was staying around even or bogeying a couple here and there. It was a good day, shot 89, and thats a pretty damn good score for Bluemound! The greens are horribly fast, and the bunkers are reminiscent to those of St. Andrews in Scotland! So, I had a couple of bad sand shots, but otherwise was hitting the ball straight the whole day! On the 6th hole, there was a  long drive contest  and the marker was pretty far, but I knew I could probably pass it.  So I tee up and smack, and the wind takes it left, and was clearly farther than the length to surpass the "record," but because I wasnt in the fairway, it doesn't count.  So, at the beginning of the round, the group was given a "One Mulligan Pass," that only One person could use, so my aunts and grandma said I could use it to try and beat it.  So I head back to the tee, and take my time, line up right, and smack the ball... it goes straight down the fairway and stops...  one YARD behind the marking stick!!!  and I'm not being sarcastic, it was literally one yard right behind the divot of the first lady!  ugh! So....the weather... was beautiful for golf! Sunny, around70, a bit of wind... I couldn't complain! It was a great day!  So the lunch that followed the 18 holes, was horrible, no joke! It was a chilled peach soup (who the fuck eats peach soup? And wouldn't a chilled soup be equivilent to yogurt?!), Salmon Salad (which I didn't like so I asked for the Chicken Salad instead, which is easy for them, cause they always have it! The Salmon got bad reviews from everyone at our table!), and the dessert kicked Boo-tay! It was Brownie-Ala-Mode...damn good! So, 1x3 isn't bad.  So...after my ridiculously long day on the greens, I headed over the the grandma's to take a dip in the pool.  Stayed for a while and came home to play some Slow-Pitch...I actually made the game this week!  So the game went well, and I played some First Base, and batted pretty hard; ailed one right a Bridget, and was safe!!!  So, we are 2 time League Champions!  Pretty Cool!  But, some of us play in the All-Star game next week, and then we play in a Championship game!  Fun Stuff!  Well, I have been up since 6 o' clock-ish, and I am sooo damn tired that I am off to beddy bye... Plans for tomorrow: Unknown!  I'm Outie Like a Belly Button everyone... G'nite!

      Freakin' Awesome Day!!!  Well, dropped off my Softball Uniform today, better late than never, and I kinda felt a bit sad doing it!  There was a Conference Championship in that Uniform, and a gave saving dive this year!  I'm going to miss North Fast-Pitch!   BREWER GAME!!!  So, the early bird DOES catch the worm!  We got there soo damn early, that we saw the end of Brewer batting practice, and...GOT AUTOGRAPHS!!!  Hell Yeah!  So, I easily was the only one around...and asked Lyle Overbay for his, and then I went to the other side of the dugout to attempt to get Geoff Jenkins', but no luck...he like ignored every attempt I made!  Oh well...Then I got Wes Helms (too bad he sucks and I can't stand the guy in general), and Right fielder Brady Clark's.  Then...my most faluable(probably in a couple years), Pitcher Victor Santos!  And then I left the dugout area cause I was being squished...then as I sit down in our Amazing Seats..who comes out of the dugout?... Scott Podsednik!  OMG, I missed the greatest opprotunity ever!  And...he plays my position, and is the most goregous player on the whole team!  Ahh...I was pissed!  So, I figured I could get those on the 13th when we go again!   So these seats we had were amazing!  Right next to the brewer dugout, 5th row, right behind the on deck circle!  I almost Died!  I was in heaven, seeing all of their faces soo close!  I had never been that close to team members in Miller Park!  So...to make the night even better than it already was...in the 3rd inning, when Capuano struck out the batter and ended the inning,  Chad Moeller , the catcher, runs over to the dugout...and sees me waving my glove as I go, "Hey Chad over here!"  And He looks, smiles, and tosses it to me, and lands in my glove!!! I then felt like 22,560 people were watching me, jealous of course, as I grabbed the priceless ball!   Ok, the game in general, if anyone cares, was ok i guess...we lost 12-3.  it was a pretty ugly last few innings!  Couple Pitcher changes, couple home runs...but hey...I still had a freakin' blast!  Down side to the night...  It poured allllllll night!  So, as I run out to my car... in my mind going,  god I hope I didnt leave any windows open?   So, of course...my sunroof was cracked open, you know, popped up kind of...and my seats, consol, cd's--ARE SOAKING!  I was so pissed I said Fuck like 20 times on the way home.  Oooh the drive home....SUCKED, the roads were so wet, you could barely see in the lane lines...I was freaking out and so was Nicole, but we were fine!   Tomorrows Game Plan: Play at Bluemound CC for a memeber guest Best Ball, and, if its not a soaked course, will most likely come home then!  I have to be in Wauwatosa at 7:15 tomorrow morning...and thats in like 7.5 hours!  So, you know what that means...have to go to bed before 2 like I normally do!  So it was an awesome day/game and I cant wait to play some G-O-L-F tomorrow bright and early!  See ya then!

      Well, the original plans for the day...waking up and joining my band geeks at "band Camp" to see some old friends, and give Fish my Softball uniform...that's well...2 months "overdue!"  So...I woke up, 20 minutes after it we were going to go...and didn't! So, what I did instead, goes as follows!   Ate breakfast, watched T.V., you know, was being my lazy self...then went to the bank...got drenched, and returned home to get ready for Hell.  Hell: Worked with Lili...which is always a blast!  And we decided that after work we were going to go and see  the Village.  So, despite bad reviews, and bad comments from friends...we went any way!  Oh my god! these people we call "our friends," have no respect for psychological thrillers!  These are the people that said Signs sucked!  So, the plot was good, the twists were awesome, and so unpredictable, and the main actress: Bryce Dallas Howard, was awesome, and a great first film for her!  So, Lili and i were officially freaked out, and we loved this Flick!  Definitely was awesome looking for M. Night Shamylan!  He's a tricky one to find, but its a good part!  Haha to all you people who haven't seen it, because its definitely a great "freaky" movie!  Then I went home.  And that's where this ends, so behind Home Plate Brewer tickets wait for me tomorrow.  That should be a blast!  watch for me on T.V.!  Goodnight!

      Eventful to say the least!  We went to the Renaissance Faire...oh wait...we didn't! We planned this forever, so i went over to Nicole's House at 9:30 to wait and see if anyone was going to randomly show up at her house.  Nope...no one did.  So, in the midst of lying on her couch, I got a phone call from my dad saying, "I'm going golfing, and my clubs are in your car!"  So I leave NB's house to high-tail it over to mine, and drop of his clubs!  So, i asked him who he was going with, and if they need an extra player, to call me up!  There's nothing like playing a championship course for free!  WoW!  So, not 20 minutes later, I get that call saying, "you can play if you get out here as quick as you can!"  So, I rush to put on my "Sunday's Best"- Golf Clothes, and speed there...going 8 over, it still took me 25 minutes to get there!  Oh well, met up with them on the 2nd hole...and gave myself a generous par for the first hole (its a straight shot, easier green, have gotten pars there before).   So, I played 17 holes, with my Dad, Uncle Buck, and my Grandma.  My dad didn't have a hole in one this round, but played so-so, he shot 84,  I played like crap, and should've shot like 84...but shot 90.  Buck shot 92, and hated the fact that his 17 year old neice, beat him!  and my grandma, who's a member there, and note: 75 years old- Shot 103!  My grandma hit the ball so far it was hystarical!  With her demoed, R7, TaylorMade (which is meant for men, who can hit it 250), and my grandma is smacking it down the fairway, like 160 yds!  It was awesome!  Overall a great day for golf, and great game none the less!  So, during my outing, Nicole called me up to see if I wanted to go see  Caberet , at the Sunset Playhouse?  I was game, I love musicals, and to see some racey 1930's acting...I was game!  So Nicole had told me, "it's not a jeans and a t-shirt place, so you need to dress up to some extent."  So I wore my cute little sundress, and Nicole wore black pants.  Certainly with us standing right next to eachother, I looked a little over dressed!  But...we also we the youngest ones there!  Apparently, the whole town of Elm Grove (all old people with money), came out tonight to get aroused!  So I felt a little out of place and a tad over dressed to say the least!  But, overall, the play was awesome, I had never seen Caberet done before, and I was impressed with all the talent!  And, knowing me, the whole time I'm sitting there looking at the guys--not oogling over them-- just trying to decipher if they're gay or not!  It was a pretty hard mission!  But, I came to the conclusion, that only one guy didn't seem so feminine...and he was the one playing the most flamboyant gay there!  He played MC, and had the greatest singing voice, I had ever heard in a musical!  I was blown away, I could've listened to him for hours at a time!  Man, Nicole and I agreed there were some great voices, and some awesome dance scenes!  I definitley would see it again!   So during the 15 minute intermission, we called up the Poker Boys, and asked if they were up for some poker!? But the only thing was...they'd have to wait for us until after the play was done and we were home!  So, they obliged! And Pat, Joe, Sam, Kristen, Nicole, and I played some Hold 'um!  It was a great time...but I definitley didn't win this round!  I was out second behind Joe!  Joe and I were the first one's out!  That's uncommon!  We're usually the last one's standing!  But After I was out I stayed for a little while and watched some more hands, then--due to extreme drowsiness--I went home, I had such a long day it was nuts!  I couldn't even write this on the day it happened! I went straight up to bed, and crashed!   I woke up and tried to remember everything that happened the day before!  And wrote, what I just wrote!  Wow thats weird!   Ok Game plan for today:  Work (gag me!) and then we're seeing The Village, should be good!
