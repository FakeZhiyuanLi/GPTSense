       MSIE = Microsoft Internet Exporer. Except, it just doesn't do that. Did you know that behind the pug-ugly interface that is IE6, is a bloated, unreliable, and down right disgustingly-badly written 'codebase'.  In fact, IE isn't even Microsoft's. If you were to look in the 'About' menu, you would see the following text:     Based on NCSA Mosaic. NCSA Mosaic(TM); was developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Distributed under a licensing agreement with Spyglass, Inc.  Contains security software licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.  Portions of this software are based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.  Multimedia software components, including Indeo(R); video, Indeo(R) audio, and Web Design Effects are provided by Intel Corp. Unix version contains software licensed from Mainsoft Corporation. Copyright (c) 1998-1999 Mainsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Mainsoft is a trademark of Mainsoft Corporation.   Ya see? 'Microsoft's Own' Web Browser is actually a loosely put together assortement of  other people's work.  To delve deeper into the subject: NCSA Mosaic (which I did a  urlLink Google  on )  hasn't been updated since 1997. So this must mean that Internet Explorer (as used by   urlLink 70.5%  of the web) is either based  on really old code  (Windows 98 was released that year), or Microsoft has managed to dissolve yet another small company in it's strong arm tactics.  So. We've established that MSIE isn't really a browser - just a program strung together in a hastened effort to bring web access to early versions of Windows. Right. But now that we're a decade on, is Internet Explorer 6 any better than the competition? I think not.    "Get more from the web with  Internet Explorer 6 "                                                                 -- www.microsoft.com    But what competition is there? Microsoft ships Internet Explorer with everything - all Windows OSs (Operating Systems) have a version of IE with them. If you buy Office 2003 you get a 'complimentary' update . This seems a little monopolising if you ask me (it's the same with Windows Media Player) - users are given a web browser, email client, media player, and told that these are the best choices. They are given no option at installation (not that many users have actually installed Windows themselves...) to bypass the inclusion of proprietary software not necessarily best for their needs. So what can the average joe do? Nothing:  Internet Explorer is so tightly packed into the Windows NT kernel (the core of the Operating System) that it is nigh on impossible to remove. Outlook Express and WiMP (Windows Media Player) seem a little easier to eradicate, but don't be fooled: there is still the registry to think about, .dlls, startup entries...  But there is another solution:  use  urlLink Firefox     urlLink  .                  " urlLink ...a breath of fresh air... Microsoft should be worried. "          - FORBES       Firefox is the grandchild of one of the past Web Browser giants: Netscape. While Netscape made the better browser (In my opinion - if you don't like it, suffer), Microsoft muscled out  Navigator  in an effort to dominate the internet. Netscape popularity suffered, forcing it to  urlLink  Open Source   it's suite of Internet utilities (Netscape Navigator & Communicator). Out of the newly open sourced software, was born  urlLink Mozilla . What started off as an ' Open Source Netscape'  has now evolved into the most popular open source browser on the planet (and also the most standards compliant). However, there were a few niggles, one of them being modubility (mozilla came as a full package). Hence, two seperate projects were spawned. One of them Firefox, a web browser - and  urlLink Thunderbird , an email client.        Firefox vs. Internet Explorer         	  	  	  	  		  			  				  				  			  			  				  Firefox   			  			  				  Internet Explorer   			  		  	  	  		  			  				  Popup Blocking   			  			  				  Yes   			  			  				  No   			  		  		  			  				  Tabbed Browsing   			  			  				  Yes   			  			  				  No   			  		  		  			  				  Standards Compliant   			  			  				  Yes   			  			  				  No   			  		  		  			  				  Themeable   			  			  				  Yes   			  			  				  No   			  		  		  			  				  Plugins   			  			  				  Yes (Extended)   			  			  				  Yes (Basic)   			  		  	     As you can see, Firefox has a number of superior features that Internet Explorer does not offer. There are many more features that can be piled into Firefox (and Thunderbird) such as advanced email encryption, mouse gestures, advanced ad/image/animation/flash/shockwave blocking and many more!
