       Countdown: 309 days      Also jacked from  Anna-chan .      Kids' quotes on love:      ~Love is that first feeling you feel before all the bad stuff gets in the way.      ~When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint her toenails anymore. So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even when his hands got arthritis too. That's love.      ~When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. You know that your name is safe in their mouth.      ~Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other.      ~Love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your French fries without making them give you any of theirs.      ~Love is when someone hurts you. And you get so mad but you don't yell at them because you know it would hurt their feelings.      ~Love is what makes you smile when you're tired.      ~Love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure the taste is OK.      ~Love is when you kiss all the time. Then when you get tired of kissing, you still want to be together and you talk more. My mommy and Daddy are like that. They look gross when they kiss.      ~Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents and listen.      ~If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend who you don't like to play with.      ~Love is hugging. Love is kissing. Love is saying no sometimes.      ~When you tell someone something bad about yourself and you're scared they won't love you anymore. But then you get surprised because not only do they still love you, they love you even more.      ~There are two kinds of love- Our love & God's love. But God makes both kinds of them. Love is important to God.      ~Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it everyday.      ~Love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well.      ~During my piano recital, I was on a stage and scared. I looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling. He was the only one doing that. I wasn't scared anymore.      ~My mommy loves me more than anybody. You don't see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night.      ~Love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken.      ~Love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford.      ~Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day.      ~I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones.      ~When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you.      ~Love is when mommy sees daddy on the toilet and she doesn't think it's gross.      ~You really shouldn't say 'I love you' unless you mean it. But if you mean it, you should say it a lot. People forget, and it's good for them to get reminded.

       [Home/07.26.04]    &nbsp;  Countdown: 314 days    &nbsp;  Haven't done one of these entries in a while, but I didn't want to forget to do it tomorrow.    &nbsp;  I just got off the phone with  Anna-chan  (as in  Annabelle , not  Kazumi , coz I wouldn't be calling  Kazumi  "Anna" XP). For those who don't know who she is--which is mostly everyone, because a lot has changed in the past three years, including my friends--she was my first (true) best friend. I met her in seventh grade and we got really close. I haven't seen her much since eighth grade promotion and I'm sorry to say we fell out of communication. But, as I was saying, I just got off the phone with her and I realized that I really miss her. I hope we can renew our friendship because she's a really awesome person to have as a friend. She has always spoken her mind and always been there when I called for her. ^^    &nbsp;  Now...moving on--I've been thinking a little about  Sharie . Yes,  Sharie . Don't ask me why, because even I don't really know. Hehe. Anyway, I can't figure out why she hates me still. I really can't. Our only disagreement was  Chris  (hm...odd how I only rarely refer to him as  Kyou  now) and she's back with him, so...why hate  me ? Because I dared to speak against her about it in the first place? Because I dared to disagree? That just reinforces my idea that she can't admit to her own mistakes. It's okay to have pride (hell, we all know I have my own--just look at the situation with Chen when I found out he was my appointed "guardian"), but I think she carries it a little too far. She's just way too stubborn...    &nbsp;  So, yes. That was my thought on that. Rather pointless, but I just wanted to get it out. I really have no interest in her life or being her friend anymore (we're way too differnet for any sort of a peaceful relationship to work), but I can't help but wonder. Anyone think that's weird?    &nbsp;  Da... I think I'm getting sick. x.x I'm sleeping a lot more (gone back to the afternoon naps) and I've kinda lost my appetite. Of course, there's been a lot on my mind, so maybe it's just more psychosomatics. Hehe.    &nbsp;  I've been thinking a little about  Brian . I feel so guilty. I know that what I did was probably the best thing for both of us--what with me still being so unsure about Chris--but...well, I just feel so guilty. He's been nothing but nice to me and it feels like I just totally shot him down. He even said he loves me. I'm not sure I can quite believe it, but I do believe  him  (as in, I believe he believes he loves me). I just don't see how he can fall in love with me after only a couple of weeks. Da... It took longer for me to fall for  Chris . Of course, look how that turned out. Hehe.    &nbsp;  I'm thinking of going back to counseling next year...because I get the feeling things will be even more hectic than this last year. Of course, counseling can also make things worse and...yeah. x.x Two sides to everything. It all depends on the counselor I get.    &nbsp;  Right. My immediate worry right now is the CES presentation tomorrow. I'm gonna go practice my song (coz I can't practice falling XP).    &nbsp;  Bai!

       Countdown: 306 days    Well, SLA's finally over. I'm so sad! Hehe. I have bruises on my hand from playing chicken with  Ben . Good times, good times.    Today was a really depressing day, but at the same time, everyone has really learned a lot from SLA and we're all glad to have taken part in such a wonderful experience. ^^ I know I am. I'm really going to miss the class of 2004, but...well, there's always e-mail and such. ^^    Moving on, this is a poem titled "Only At SLA" and it was written by  Stella . ^^ I thought I'd share it, coz it's really cool. Hehe.    "Only At SLA"   by  Stella Kim     Only at SLA will students rise and face all four directions to pledge allegiance.   Only at SLA will the principal nearly expel you for not counting loud enough.   Only at SLA will we hear the words "open the door" ten million times the first day.   Only at SLA will we pay nothing for admission and then pay a fortune to eat inside.   Only at SLA will we be reminded everyday to turn in baby pictures but people will still forget.   Only at SLA will we snap our fingers and hit our desks and call it the weekly clap.   Only at SLA will we end at 12:19, not 12:20 or 12:15, but 12:19.   Only at SLA will a virus allow you a minute to save your work before shutting off your computer.   Only at SLA will we find out the secrets of getting into Standford but find out that UCSD is a reach school.   Only at SLA will the ethnic delight dinner consist of 90% Asian food. Another 5% is soda.   Only at SLA will we wear name tags every single day for seven weeks. (You'd think we would know each other by then)   Only at SLA will we hear stories of saving birds, pregnant women, and sideway elevators early in the morning.   Only at SLA will we write about hwo much we love our friends in our last critique and then beat them with our self-portraits the next day.   Only at SLA will we make friends quicker than we ever did before and sincerely be sorry that school is over.              Horoscope for Gemini  03 Aug 2004        Reach financial agreements with others. Your pursuits may end up being fruit less. Unexpected bills will be impossible for you to pay.         CHOOSE...

       Countdown: 307 days      Are your palms sweaty, is your heart racing and is your voice caught within your chest?   It is not love, it's like.   You can't keep your eyes or hands off them, am I right?   It isn't love, it's lust.   Are you proud and eager to show them off?   It isn't love, it's luck.   Do you want them because you know they are there?   It isn't love , it's loneliness.   Are you there because it's what everybody wants?   It isn't love, it's loyalty.   Are you there because they kissed you or held your hand?   It isn't love, it's low confidence.   Do you stay for their confessions of love because you don't want to hurt them?   It isn't love, it's pity.   Do you belong to them because their sight makes your heart skip a beat?   It isn't love, it's infatuation.   Do you pardon their faults because you care about them?   It isn't love, it's friendship.   Do you tell them every day they are the only one you think of?   It isn't love, it's a lie.   Are you willing to give up all your favorite things for their sake?   It isn't love, it's charity.      NOW GET A LOAD OF THIS.      Does your heart ache and break when they are sad?   Then it's love.   Do you cry for their pain, even when they are strong?   Then it's love.   Do their eyes see your true heart, and touch your soul so deeply that it hurts?   Then it's love.   Do you stay because a blinding, incomprehensible mix of pain and relation pulls you close and holds you there?   Then it's love.   Do you accept their faults because they are a part of who they are?   Then it's love.   Are you attracted to others, but stay with them faithfully without regret?   Then it's love.   Would you allow them to leave you, not because they want to but because they have to?   Then it's love.   Would you give them your heart, your life?   Then it's love.      Definition of Love      When you think of your past love, you may view it as a failure. But when you find a new love, you view the past as a teacher. In the game of love, it doesn't really matter who won or who lost. What is important is you know when to hold on and when to let go! You know you really love someone when you want him or her to be happy, even if their happiness means that you're not part of it. Everything happens for the best. If the person you love doesn't love you back, don't be afraid to love someone else again, for you'll never know unless you give it a try. You'll never love a person you love unless you risk for love. Love strives in hurting. If you don't get hurt, you don't learn how to love. Love doesn't hurt all the time. Though the hurting is still there to test you, to help you grow. Don't find love, let love find you. That's why it's called falling in love because you don't force yourself to fall. You just fall. You cannot finish a book without closing it's chapters. If you want to go on, then you have to leave the past as you turn the pages. Love is not destroyed by a single failure or won by a single caress. It is a lifetime venture in which we are always learning, discovering and growing. The greatest irony of love is letting go when you need to hold on and holding on when you need to let go. We lose someone we love only when we are destined to find someone else who can love us even more than we can love ourselves. On falling out of love, take some time to heal and then get back on the horse. But don't ever make the same mistake of riding the same one that threw you the first time. To love is to risk rejection, to live is to risk dying, to hope is to risk failure. But risk must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is risk nothing! To reach for another is to risk involvement, to expose your feelings is to expose true self, to love is to risk not to be loved in return. How to define love: fall but do not stumble, be constant but not too persistent, share and never be unfair, understand and try not to demand, hurt but never keep the pain. Love is like a knife. It can stab the heart or it can carve wonderful images into the soul that always last for a lifetime. Love is supposed to be the most wonderful feeling. It should inspire you and give you joy and strength. But sometimes the things that give you joy can also hurt you in the end. Loving people means giving them the freedom who they choose to be and where they choose to be. For all the heartaches and the tears, for gloomy days and fruitless years, you should give thanks, for you know, that there were the things that helped you grow. Loving someone means giving him the freedom to find his way, whether it leads towards you or away from you. Love is a painful risk to take but the risk must be taken no matter how scary or painful, for only then you'll experience the fullness of humanity and that is love. Only love can hurt your heart, fill you with desire and tear you apart. Only love can make you cry and only love knows why. If you're not ready to cry, if you're not ready to take the risk, if you're not ready to feel the pain, then you're not ready to fall in love. There was a time in our lives when we became afraid to fall in love cause every time we do, we get hurt, then i figured that's why it's called falling in love. Whatever happened, don't give up! It is just a trial. After all God will not give you trial that you can't tackle. Have faith in yourself and cheer up. No matter what will happen, I'm always a friend at your back to support you.. with the right decision. But then if it's the wrong track as to where you want to go… I'm one of your greatest enemy.      Jacked from  Anna-chan . XP I've been doing that a lot lately...      Anyway, this made me think a lot. I know it's probably best if I just push him from my mind, but I can't seem to do it. I said once upon a time that love is happiness, but I'm anything but happy now. This gave me some perspective and I realize now that love isn't happiness, not all the time. Love can cause happiness, but it can also cause great hurt and pain. So...I have come to redefine my definition of love.      Love is wanting to be with someone so much that no amount of hurt or sorrow is enough to stand in your way. Love can feel wonderful, but it can also hurt so bad that some days all you want to do is crawl under your blankets and cry. That is love. At least...for now.

       Countdown: 308 days      I still can't spell that boy's name. Hehe. But, anyway,  Keithan  is my little second cousin. He's probably my favorite, coz he's always so hyper and cute and affectionate towards me. ^^ I went to see him yesterday and the first thing he did when he saw me was attach himself to my leg. Then he gave me a bite-size Snickers. ^^ I love lil kids. Hehe.      Later, when my sister was scaring him, he climbed onto my lap and hugged me and said, "I'm scared of the ghost. I'm scared.
