       The Significant Other       At one point or another in everyones lives, we will have what I will call "The Significant Other". One of those few people you date, who becomes so much a part of your life, that going to the washroom seems like a trip to Siberia, without them.  Whether you are straight, gay or whomever....this person will play a key role in your life. It is with this comment that I address those people who, (maybe subconciously), literally pack up their previous life (ie; life before "The One"), and store it in a box, in some grimy hole of their mind. It IS TRUE!! I have personally witnessed people; forget friends names!,  leave their homes, and yes!! YES even toss beloved pets aside, all for the love of well.......love. To those who are finding this sounds a little too familiar, be you the "dating" or the "dumped", I say this: To the "dating"; Wake up. If there is ever a time you need your friends, it is always. To the "dumped friend" Ok, so now that you know who your friends are, go out and find some better ones.

      Today: Post Party......minimal headache,.......no gut rot. All in all a great party.  Well, no one got naked, (atleast not at Vanier!!) There was however, some awesome entertainment. Some first year BFA brought out the sparkly, white glove and got down to Micheal Jackson's "Billy Jean". The lad was unfortunately outdone by the stylings of Jamaal Grant, a fourth year BFA. It was 80's awesome. Courtney Bradley and Bryce Duddly wowed the crowd with their "Moulin Rouge" routine. (Something makes me think they practiced that!??) All in all no real drama. The president of the University, Ross Paul, actually made it out to the party. (maybe that accounts for the lack of nudity)

      Well, It is Opening night at the University of Windsor! The University Players Presents......"It's Only A Play". Although I am sure the play will be wonderful (as they all are) I am really interested in seeing who makes an ass of themselves at the afterparty. (hope it's not me) Stay tuned tomorrow, for my review of the alcohol situation at the party. I am still taking bets as to who will get naked and dance on a table. Anyone?

                  I take mindpower to a new level.  There are those who think and those who act.  I am a rare combination of both.  I make that which I think into that which you see.  Mind over matter and then some.  I am not quick tempered, but crossing my line is far from wise.  I am known to be lazy, but who wouldn't be?  I can move things with my mind.

       A Blatant Retort To SARA's INSANE Ramblings  Well Ms Wisking. Since you have decided to fight fire with your soggy wit, I have decided to take the preverbial gloves off.  SInce you have decided (in your narrowminded little way) to play to the stereotyping of Pink, I think you should stop wearing colours that are so obviously "masculine". No longer shall you wear "blue" jeans, as blue is the colour of little boys. If you are going to stereotype Pink, well then you must mean to stereotype all colours. And if you are going to attempt to defend that one, then just try. If pink has classically been known as a "feminine" colour, well then it is doubly true that "blue" has long since been considered "masculine". You must be attempting to eminate the male species Ms Wisking, if you wear blue. Since I for one, do NOT agree with your Gender stereotyping of colours, I am fortunately free to wear whatever I want, ignoring the malicious comments from those of your "kind".       I would like to take this moment to explain to you, what marriage is all about. My Father (Bill) and my mother (Jan) agree on COMPROMISES in their marriage. For example, Jan wants to decorate the Master Bedroom in Dusty Rose and Mauve colours, while Bill wants a 37 inch TV and entertainment unit, they both agree to get what they want, they COMPROMISE! I guess my Father just wants my mother to be happy, and considers a "Pink" room, (which no one sees except for family and friends, who decide to use it aginst him) a small price to pay, to have the leather couches, and 37 inch TV that he wants in the living room. We know who runs the roost in your house. If you can't even add water to the mushrooms while cooking dinner, in fear of setting off LINDA!, Well then, she must weild some power! And who are you to make fun of my Dad living in a "Pink" room, when your Dad's video colection includes "DOWN TO YOU" with Freddy Prince Junior!!!!! Take a good hard Look MS WISKING. A good hard look at the colour PINK!!!!!   Pink; It's not just for babies, and Snippy, biased Law Students ANYMORE!!!!

      Dearest Blog Enthusiasts, It has come to my attention, that some Bloggers ( urlLink SARA WISKINGS BLOG!! ), have decided to insinuate that the colour,"pink", and variations of this shade are UNMANLY! Well, as it happens, Sara is a very good friend of mine. Infact we live together, and she has chosen to slander my family name by suggesting that my FATHER!! Bill.......is somewhat less of a man, becuase my Mother (Jan) has decided to decorate their room, in MAUVE's and DUSTY ROSES!!! Well, Ms Wisking, I would like to point out that many, VERY MANLY men, are partial to pink. To name a few, Robert Redford, MEL Gibson, MACHO Man Randy Savage (with a name like that, he can't help but be MANLY!!) and my Moms favorite RICHARD GERE!!!!         Will the colour stereotyping NEVER END!!!!! I for one will dress all of my children in pink, blue and orange, no matter their sex. Ms Wisking; Will your children be subjected to the horrible slander of Pink, because you fail to see it's unique and gender free appeal? One can only hope that some day, the narrow minded view of this classic colour will end, so our children, and Fathers can be free. FREE TO WEAR AND LIVE IN PINK!!!! P.S Sara, My Dad can so kick your Dad's butt.  Allison Helmer ( Advocate For Pink In The Home) PLEASE FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME WITH YOUR VIEWS ON PINK. smashedpotatoes123@hotmail.com

      Ok, so here is the deal. Sara did not actually "dump" anyone for me, because in fact I was not "dating" said individual. We had two dates, and on the second he was horribly grabby, and lecherous, which promptly turned me off. So, having said that, we were not wrong in letting him down over the phone, because it was not an actual relationship that was terminated, but merely helping him to "get the hint".

      So, I have been applying for various jobs, at American summer camps for 2003. I am SOOOOO excited. There is one that I am really keen on.(god, I am not even at camp and I am using the word KEEN!!) Anyhoo, check out  urlLink Camp Chinqueka  It looks like the best CAMP EVER!!!. Not only for Keener Staff members like myself, but for Campers too!! They have boating and waterskiing (which is what I'd be doing), and GO-KARTS!! How cool is that?? The other Camp that I am very Interested in,(ok so there are a few more I'd LOVE to work at) is  urlLink Camp Lake Of The Woods  It looks like an awesome place too, (but they don't pay too well) BUT that is not the point!! I am really looking for a camp where I can have fun with my kids. I really want the whole CAMP experience! The bad part about that, is that I will be going to the States, form Canada, and WORK VISA'S ARE EXPENSIVE. So, if a Camp doesn't pay you that much, well............. Anyone have any good camp experiences that they'd like to share?? Please Mail me......

      Dear God, Over the past few weeks I have prayed very hard for the innocent people who will lose their lives over this war. I pray for the mothers and fathers, children and soldiers from Iraq and the United States, that they may know peace in their darkest hours. I have always been told that is is wrong to hate. How, God, can I understand why your people let this happen? How can people have so much hate in their hearts? Please grant those involved the patience and serentity to see that only death will be acomplished from this war. And only hate will be achieved.   Love Allison

      Well Blog Friends, My time in Windsor is coming to an end. I will be moving on to new and exciting things soon. This post is a wonderous  recap of my life in Windsor.    1999-*FIRST YEAR*  I arrive at my new home in Windsor, Ontario. MacDonald Hall, room 814. I discover that my roomate was actually born in the same hospital as I was, exactly one month apart. The closet we share (by closet I mean tiny room) is by no means luxurious, but we make it livable with pictures from home and fun posters. Jill Lewis and I shared a rollercoaster year in residence, where strangely enough people do NOT act like adults, even though they are all over 12, and attending University.    2000-2001-*SECOND YEAR*  I have moved into a wonderfully old house with slanted roofs and fun little closets in the hallways. My self, Laura Barr, Stephanie Hilliard, Richard Brunner,and Luke Jaster, have agreed to share liiving quarters (cause that was really the extent of the relationship) We had a really great Halloween party. Some guy got naked in our basement, and scrubbed up in the extra shower down there, in front of a large group of girls. We had some rough times, mostly due to the fact that some of us had a different view on what cleanlyness and paying the rent means. (Some actually believe COCKROACHES are a sign of cleanliness. Go figure) I will mostly remember the alcoholic rampage that went down in a certain boys room......R......I.....you get it. Jamaal Grant set the land speed record for coming to a girls aid in 2.4 seconds from 20 blocks away, when she hasn't even put the phone down, after screaming at him to   "GET OVER HERE!! HE'S GONE COMPLETELY NUTS!!!!!!"  But I digress. I loved that little house and I will never forget it.   2001-2002-*THIRD YEAR*  Needing some sanity, I move in with longtime schoolchum Sara Wisking. She was accepted to Law School at Windsor, and we hurriedly found an apartement in AUGUST. Needless to say it was a long walk to school. I had a great year. I worked at the University Players Box Office once again, and had fun working part-time for TD Canada Trust. Most Memorable was the flood of 2002. Sara and I lived in a variable swimming pool for 4 days, when the upstairs neighbours pipes burst in their kitchen. The upstairs neighbour was very nice to us. She made us tea when we had no power.!! No heat, no power, new kitty. Not fun!!! Needless to say, the bottom floor of an apartement building is not the greatest.    2002-2003-*FOURTH YEAR*  WELL!!! My last year here.  Moved to a new apartement with Sara,  closer to school WHICH WAS GREAT!!! Sara met a nice boy named Scott. He is a pilot. He helped us shlep all our stuff over to the new apt, when our GIMPY Dads couldn't make it. They are both invalids!! I had some fun times. Found out about life and what's at the end of the rainbow. No boys to speak of. But I DON'T CARE!!! I am employed at a cool summer camp starting in June. I AM SO EXCITED!!! I can't wait to go home to Ottawa, and see my  BEST FRIEND KARIN SELST!!!!  She is just finishing her Masters Degree. Smart Gal that Karin. When I get back from camp I plan to take some required courses for health sciences, and get into Med school, or first Nursing. Not sure, but I am enjoying this new direction in my life.   LOVE TO ALL!! Hope you keep checking up on me as I'll be posting from around North America this coming summer!!!!!!  GOD BLESS!!! TAKE CARE!!! BE NICE TO ANIMALS!!!    LOVE ALWAYS ALLISON

       Back In The Land Of Canada   Well Folks, I have officially returned to God's Country. Having spent the past few months in the United States Of America, there are a few things I have learned about Americans and their Country in General.  1. When asked how long it took you to build the igloo you live in, just say 2 months. This is the fastest way to avoid any other stupid questions.  2. When asked how many dogs pull your dogsled, for the love of GOD!! say 12. Then proceed to list all of their names as you walk away muttering about the price of dogfood.   3. Do not feel obligated to remind Americans that Canada is Not part of the United states.  4. Applaud them for atleast knowing one Frenchmans name, when they ask if Jacques Cousteau is the President of Canada.....  Seriously, there was only really one or two Ignorant Americans I met this summer, and they were from "Southern States".....ie; REDNECKS!!! But the majority of them still didn't know who our Prime Minister was. When I asked Americans why they though I knew who their President was, they said..."Cause EVERYONE knows who our President is, because he keeps doing dumb shit!"   But I digress. I had a BLAST this summer, and I urge all of you with some sense of Adventure to try out a camp job! And you kinda need to love kids too. Check out some new pics of my campers and staff at  urlLink Chinqueka's Summer Website!!!  Hopefully I will get a chance to see all my friends soon, Now that you KNOW I have returned to Ottawa.

       My Kind Of Town   Well, know I know what old Frank Sinatra was really talking about. My new home in Hinsdale IL, (a suburb of Chicago) is really agreeing with me. I am a Nanny for three adorable kids. Aidan and Evan, twin two year olds, and Avery, 6 months.  They are so cute....!!!! Mail me if you want my address. To all camp buddies who may be in the area......STOP BY!!!! Love Alley

       Time For Some Fall Cleaning   Well I have decided a change was in order, so....other than our bold new colours, we have changed our Mascot here at the SmashedPotatoes lab. This year we will be examining the Canadian in the USA. Since I have been here for 3 weeks, I have noticed that alot of my neighbours are CANADIAN!! Why, you ask??? Not sure yet. But rest assured I will get to the bottom of this serious annomoly....is that how you spell it. Stay tuned

      Well now. It has been literaly months, since I have blogged, and after reading the Diatribe on All-Inclusive resorts on  urlLink  Sara's Blog  I have decided that my opinions must be posted. Firstly...(is that a word...too bad) I must express my sincere love of All-Inclusive resorts. Far be it from me to tell you how to enjoy your vacation, but ONE of my ideas of heaven is lounging around in a tropical pool while hot, tanned men/(or women, whatever you like...) bring me slushy drinks in coconut shells. If this is not for you.....well, I just don't know what to say. I do agree with Sara's statement about local culture and wares.More later when I am not working.....DAMN NO TIME TO BLOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        KARIN IS GETTIN HITCHED!!!!       &nbsp;   Yesterday, while browsing in the Billings Bridge Plaza, I FOUND a dress for Karin's wedding!! I can't tell you how excited I am, and not only because it was      22$!!! ONLY 22$!!! I know what you are thinking,...how ugly is it for that much? Well, I bought it at Reitmans and they were having a FINAL END OF SEASON SALE!! It had been marked down from 90$ to 40$ to 30$ and finally to 19.99$, plus tax. HOW SWEET A DEAL!! I have yet to get my digital camera cord back from the good folks in CT, But when I do!! Pictures will follow.     By the way Karin Elizabeth Selst will wed Andrew Scott Boyd McDermott, August 7th in Ottawa!! SO EXCITING!! It will be a wonderful day. I am looking forward to it.

       How exciting is SUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have just been on a ride in the boat. My brother spent WEEKS!!! Refurbishing it, so it looks nice. Wow, did he do a good job. The interior was completely ripped out and replaced. He hired someone else to redo the seat covers. He spent two weeks sanding priming and then painting the hull and the deck. Pictures will follow soon!!!!. I love suntans........

       I Have to say, that I have never been a big fan of the colour PINK. I have had red hair for most of my life, and recently went blond. WELL!! This weekend, I took a big step and wore A PINK DRESS, to my Best Friends Wedding. Seeing as it is summer, ofcourse I have a wicked tan, so the dress just looked AWESOME!!!.....Well I think so, but here is a pic for ya.....You can comment and let me know what you think.........
