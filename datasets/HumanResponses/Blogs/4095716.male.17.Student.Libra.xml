      Last few days of holidays and what exiciting  *sarcastic*  days ive had....  Lets see...   Monday .. Boring...   Tuesday ... Boring.. Then later in the evening Douglas came and we played Ping-Pong.. i won... but then he trashed me in snooker badly... i must beat him soon... Or Else...   Wednesday ... 2 of my school friends came over to the house.... had to take a bus into town just to bring them here... then ate like  pigs ... they left... boring.. then ate like a  pig  again... went to the pasar malam cause of Mindy and her "Im Bored" phase... but it was cool.. haven't gone to a pasar malam in ages.. bought 2 CD's.. Michael Buble and Some cheap Rap & Hip Hop album... Sent her back and slept like a  dog ... * Sorry for the uses of animal names *     Thursday ... Boring..   Friday ... Half of the day and its really boring...  All of these days... and nothing except for my daily morning swims.. TV.. Sleep.. Eat.. Study.. and computer most of the time.... but how can one not do all those things... damn... hope the weekend is better.... peace

      It looks like a cruel start of the new premiership season.... Man United lost 1-0 to Chelsea.... Yes Guys... The Giants have lost... *sob sob* tHey played a frustrating game and didnt look close to scoring... or at least hardly.... Couldnt believe it.. im really really dissapointed.... it actually is a quite dissapointing day... i lost playing pool 9-7 to my friend Doug... and 1-0 in snooker... which came up to like 17bucks a person.... but there will be a rematch soon enough... Another shock... "Dream Team" USA have been demolished by Costa Rica.. Im dead serious... Whatz up??? no Kobe, no Shaq, no Richardson, no wonder they lost... they lost by 19 points on top of that.... really irratatin me.... anyway... till next time... pEace

        I was resigned to my fate and dreaded what I had done, Life full of boundaries, troubles I had succumbed, I dreaded each day, toiled with sweat and blood, With no one to share the pain, the burden, I had to overcome, I sat in the loneliness, had no one by my side, Somehow within me, my hopes, my dreams had all died, I had no one to love me, I had no one to hold, So i just lay there, under the stars, there in the cold, I prayed each night, Dear God, dont worry i'd say, you have others to care, For Life's troubles, I will struggle to endure, But remember dear Lord, before my last breath, In your arms would I lay, my pain I give rest.
