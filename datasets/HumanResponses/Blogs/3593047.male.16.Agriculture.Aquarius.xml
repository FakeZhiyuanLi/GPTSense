      Alright I now know that Omry is at a Jewish Summer Camp and is coming back on the 19th. Unfortunately that is the day I am leaving to go to North Carolina. I told Juan, my friend who I am planning on making the manager, that we will hold our first meeting a few days after I get back from vacation and to tell Zack and Omry about it. I am going to make up for me being gone by getting a lot of song writing done in North Carolina and being ready to do this thing as soon as I get back.

      Ive lost Omry! Where is he? Nobody knows. I think he went to Israel for vacation to visit his dad but I could be wrong. If any body out there knows please tell! This is really going to stall the progress of our band and Zack wants a conformation on whether or not were doing this!

      Alright, now that its no longer midnight and I’ve had a good nights rest I can make my real first post.  My name is Dylan and I’m from Indianapolis, IN and I go to North Central High School (check my profile for more stuff about me).  I’m going to use this blog for me and my band which wont be officially formed until the beginning of next school year and thus I will be filling you in on how that is going from time to time.  I’ll also use this site for my own personal use especially times like right now, during summer vacation, when I don’t have anything better to do other than sit around and type.  Speaking of summer vacation I’ll go ahead and list below my list of things I want to do, have to do, plan on doing or whatever:  -Form a band with my buddy Omry (yes, dread man). -Get a head start on programming, a class I’m taking next school year. -Take drivers ed… -…then get a license. -Learn to play guitar better. -Go on vacation to North Carolina for a family reunion during the last half of June. -Get back into shape. -Stop being so shy. -Sleep in. -Read Catcher in the Rye a million more times. -Do all the chores my parents can think up for me to do. -Get my Xbox back from whoever I lent it to. -Smile more. ;) -Make some money.  That’s all I can think of right now.  I might be on later today, updating AIM and stuff, if your from Indy and go to North Central, drop me a response and let me know I’m not the only one out here.

      The purpose of this blog is to rant, rave, perforate, bash, and keep fools out of the white house, the Capitol building, and well out of politics completely if its posible. If you are one of these fools I suggest you run far far away and like move to some place where your horribly defunct ways can no longer harm peoples rights and no longer harm people in general.  I would like to run this blog in the spirit of such a website as Punkvoter.com but I'm not perfect and neither are they, so if you have any ideas email me or post on this or whatever.I was also inspired inpart by Michael Moore who I must give credit to.And if your reading this TELL ME!  This is  Me  signing off in the name of anybody  anybody  but Goerge Dubya Bush.
