      Today was okay...rather quiet. I need to get a regular job to fund the stuff I want out of life. It really sux to know that if I had a job that everything would be okay. Of course, If I got my Disability then all would be cake...  Hmmmm, Cake...  Well that is all for today, my life is rather boring....  Still the prettiest...

      Today was not bad. I avoided everyone and slept for the better part of a day. I need more days like this...  Finally got to chat with a kid I met at  urlLink www.gothicpersonals. com He is a real charmer and I think we will be friends for a while. I would love to go on a world tour and visit all my friends in foreign countries, but it will have to wait till I can afford it :O)  Still The Prettiest...

      Today was one of those days that you wish you never had. It started so-so and fell from there.  Heres what happened:  My future sister-in-law and her husband need to keep better watch on their child. I once overheard Ben, the husband, comment to the wife, Jen, the future sister-in-law, that he was tired of everyone else in the house treating Zakari, their hellspawn, like he was their own. What they fail to realize apparently is that they are living in a house  that has other adults in it. We know that if something happens to Zak and DCFS is called in it won't be fixed by telling them no one was allowed to punish the brat. Welcome to reality and here's your sign, ya morons!  So anyway Zak decided one day to play with an outlet in the house, me, being part of and understanding what is commonlly called reality by those of us on the planet Earth, decided to stop him out of instinct knowing full well that it could and would harm him or even end his little life. I got a third degree for it from his mom saying that if she and her husband were around they should punish him.  Okay, Let us examine reality again. I acted out of INSTINCT to save a child, sorry didn't know that was wrong! So on another occassion Shawn was yelled at by his sister who plainly stated she could take care of her own child! Yeah Right!!, LOL. If her kid had died from the outlet how true would that have been?  So today I punished him again for climbing on a table and got it again. Tried to have a talk with his "parents" and got nowhere, so I have decided that it is not fruitful  to continue dealing with Zak. I love him, but I will not abide watching as he is twisted to be like the rest of my boyfriend's psycho family.  I pity the people, who come after me, who will be involved with this nightmare of a family on steroids...

      Today was most interesting because I felt most relaxed. No bullsh*t or drama just peace. Now I am chatting, more or less, and surfing the Web :O) A perfect end to a near perfect day! I say near perfect because it would only have been perfect should I have won the Lottery LOL No therapy sessions till next week so nothing to worry about except the people I live with, but I can just avoid them...   Looking forward to brighter days...

      Today I underwent a two hour therapy session with my counselor. It went well, I think. Although, My counselor was a bit off put by me. She did warm up though when she realized I wasn't going to foam at the mouth and leap across the desk to throttle her. I meet with her again next week.  I had a conversation with Shawn, my boyfriend, and I guess I laid down an ultimatum to fix the problems with our lives or I am gone. I didn't mean for it to come across that way, but it did. I would never want to leave him, but I have to many physical  and mental problems to cope with anymore. I am sure that his family heard and I am expecting to have even more problems than what I have now.  I am sorry my dear reader if for the past days I have left you feeling neglected. This is my first Blog so it is difficult to get into the flow of writing, but I am getting better. I find it so eerie that we can counsel others, but not ourselves...  Looking forward to brighter days...

      Today I had another rapid mood swing...in fact I am still in it's grip. I can't take this much longer. I am tired of being poor and I am tired of only having one Internet account. Whenever I need the Interet, my boyfriend needs it and vice versa.   I actually snapped at him for taking so long online. I feel like maybe this stems from my brattiness, but I am not accoustumed to this life.  I need a way out, a way to  actually  relax instead of just forcing my body and mind to calm down. The people that live in this town don't understand what it is to get out and away. They are old adults raising old children. Everyday I am here I feel a little bit of me is stolen and consumed by banality and the mundanes around me.  I need lights, noise and people...a party! Anything  to break the monotony.   I have a two hour therapy session tomorrow. I hope all goes well.

      Today was interesting. I think my bf's , Shawn,  sister overheard a conversation we, Shawn & I, were having this morning. I simply stated to Shawn that my therapist was having trouble understanding why I, with all my various medical problems, was the sole cleaner of the house we all co-habitate. She, actually one of my therapist,  felt that it was abuse of the disabled to force me to pick up after several able bodied adults.  So incredibly everyone was nice to me today. It could also be due to the fact that I refuse to be the only one to clean. I mean I held several jobs, went to school and went out for fun and was still able to keep house decently. Whats their excuse?  Other than that I played video games all day. I really am hoping that my church (prepare for a shameless plug :O)), The Sacred Way Fellowship, will make it off the ground. I mean I need to dedicate myself to it and push hard so that it does. Other than that I have nothing to report.

      Today was much the same as yesterdy with one exception, my bf's mom decided to put on a hissy fit show because the fridge was to filled with food...really who does that?  I am interested in shopping now, I need to return to my dark self, I am getting tired of this "normal" facade I wear. I am also downloading music again. My musical taste tend to fall all over. I can listen to any kind of music...unless it sux LOL

      My day was okay, not good nor bad, but okay. I got my stamps today, but had to wait till dark to get food. I need to start eating and sleeping  more. I really have nothing more to write about today so sorry if you feel cheated or something :O(

      Today I went to the first stage of recieving mental health services. I was a tad afraid, but the ladies that helped me today were extremely nice. They made sure that I got everything in order and made sure that I understood it all.  My boyfriend even read the stuff I brought home and will be available to sit in on sessions and even help me comply with the guidelines of my treatment program. I am very calm right now and relaxed which is something I have not been in a long time. I also feel that this Blog is a great theraputic tool. I can organize everything here and I know only my closest friends and family will probably read it.  I also started a new website (niji.wiccawebsites.com) because all the others I tried to activate on Tripod are having to many problems for me to cope with right now. Now, I don't really know if I really consider myself a Wiccan, but for now it is close enough.  Today's breakthrough was about the fact that alot of my sexual issues may stem from the years of sexual abuse from cousins. I used to think that it was okay for them  to have sex with me when I was younger, but now I realize that I could'nt fully understand what was happening to me. I also used to think that what happened to me was okay because I did'nt say "No!", but I realize now that I was probably led to believe it was okay, even when it was'nt.  Please don't get me wrong...I am not saying that if it was'nt for my cousins I would be straight or any of that foolishness because I would have been gay or at least bisexual by now anyway. I enjoy men and would'nt change for anyone or thing. What I am saying is that if it was'nt for them then maybe I would be "normal" today. My previous relationships would'nt have been so fu*ked up. Such is life though.  I am eternally thankful for my bf and every bit of his love. I never knew that such love could exsist. Or that I was capable of feeling this way about anyone, including myself. I hope to grow old with him and have (adopt) many children! LOL  I plan on re-starting "The Plan", which until now was a sort of vague list of things that I wanted from and to do with life.  I feel like the future is bright for the first time in a long while.

      Today was tolerable. I went with my bf to try and get his check only to find out that his boss had a pressing appointment and could'nt be bothered with paying her abused and p*ssed off employees. I sometimes wonder if the makers of that age old snack, Cracker Jack's, actually do put liscences, certifications, etc, etc in their tasty snacks.  I played "Animal Crossings" which is an awesome game, for those of you who don't know what it is...LOOK IT UP!!!! I am also awaiting my Public Aid, yes Public Aid! Got a problem?  Other Stuff happened too, but I won't bore you with the details, as I said today was tolerable...

      Today I had to deal with my in-laws when they were in one of their frequent moods. I  left Chicagoland to move to the country to be with the man I love, but it seems now that the negatives are starting to out weight the positives, for example I left my job, family, friends and life to live here and I feel like all I get is shat on at every oppurtunity.   I have gotten blamed for all their ills and frankly if you meet these people you will see for yourself that their ills have been, are now and will be forever of their own design.  When his sister and her family moved in it got worse. I don't know how much longer this relationship can last when the very people you live with want so desperately for it to fail..

      The rest of yesterday was good also. We didn't encounter a single problem. Lets just hope this isn't a calm before a storm :O( I got to watch Lion King 1 1/2. It was okay, but nothing to race to the theatre for :O( I am finding myself increasingly bored while online. Unless I have someone to talk to I get bored rather easily. I believe the sex problem Shawn and I are having is because we are stuck in some kind of wierd rut.   I hope there is an end to this rut soon or we are going to have problems.  Well, I guess that is all for now, I am going to log off and go downstairs to watch the last of the movies...

      Yesterday was good. I managed not to have to kill a single person. Just a few minutes ago I caved and talked to Marc and he resumed his potshots at liberals then ran off. Definately getting tired of his crap, but getting soft and nice in my old age :O)   Definately need to get to Galesburg to re-apply for Disability/SSI. We really need to move out soon or else I will kill them all. Nothing overtly stressful has happened. I just really think we could do better on our own.  I plan to buy a new car and rent us an apartment or house when I get my D/SSI. I bet we will be sooo happy then :O)  Still the prettiest...

      Yesterday was another good day. I went to therapy and had to reschedule with Susan for next week. I owe her homework and this gives me enough time to actually do it :O) The reason I rescheduled was because I already had to see Doctor Sachdiva today too. I was not up to two therapy sessions in one day.  Doc alayed my fears of the news clip I read about a study finding that older patients have strokes associated with the meds I am taking. She says I have nothing to fear. So, Just so we are all on the same page:  Doctor Sachdiva= Psychiatrist Susan= Counselor Nan= Nurse  Their excellent people and I am glad that they are on my team.  So I have decided that the only times I will talk to Marc is when he talks to me. I do not want to deal with his fundimentalism :O(  Still the prettiest...

      Yesterday and today were good days. With the exception of Shawn's sister saying that she lost money. $9.18 to be exact. She claims to have left it in her jeans which she left in the bathroom on the floor. I just hope Shawn and I don't get blamed for this.  His family has a habit of taking their problems out on us. I bought a new fish today. It is a large goldfish. He has black accents :O) I named him "Goldie" :O) He and the other two in the 10 gallon tank are getting on swimmingly, pun intended LOL  I discovered a lump in my cheek today which I am hoping is a bug bite. It does not feel hard or soft, but it is definately there. I am hoping against hope that it is not cancer or anything like that. I won't put Shawn through that...  Last night we attended our dinner club and had a great time. We had a convorsation about politics and cell phones. It is nice when you can actually participate in the convos around you :O)

      Definately thinking about dropping Marc Bennett as a friend :O( He is turning into an uber conservative, right wing Republican a**hole. Yesterday was good because everyone went their own ways again. Starting to see a pattern? I am. I will stay wherever Shawn is, but his family is a major part of my stress. I am under Doctor's orders to relax or else.  I really need less strain. Really, I do. I am under fire from Marc about being a Wiccan, which quite frankly, how I worship is none of his buisiness to criticize. I mean I could see if I was a cultist or something, but I am a Wiccan.  I feel sorry for his problems and that, but it gives him no right to try and take them out on me!

      Yesterday was good. Everyone went their seperate ways and did their own thing. Shawn and I went to the video store and had a quiet dinner. I am feeling like I need to get away and have peace and quiet. It is hard to do that when one has no car of ones own.  I need to take better care of Shawn. I will put forth the effort for this today. I'll tell you how it goes.  Not quite sure about the prettiest....

      Today was another interesting day. First, Fish from Wal-Mart suck a**! The day after the first Koi died, the second one dies. WTF!? We may not shop for pets at that store again :O( Other than that I learned that the wrestler known as "Paul London" makes me happy in the pants, if you know what I mean :O)  So, Back to the pets. I know have a large-ish white fish I have chosen to name "Ghost" and a small black and white one named "Zebra". I also have a Beta named "Blue", which technically is Shawn's, but he won't claim him. We also have a turtle named "Speedy" and a hermit crab named "Napoleon". The whole family has a dog named "Sox".  Although, You probably already knew/figured out I love pets and what their names were I decided to tell you again :O)  Ran into Bud, a guy from our Tuesday dinner group, today at the Sandburg Mall. We weren't used to him out in about :O) We normally only see him at the KoC.   Still the prettiest...

      Yesterday was another good day. The day before yesterday though I got the third degree about buying myself and my nephew Kois. His mom decided that if he had a pet that his parents would be the ones taking care of said pet. Well, to make a long story short one of the Kois died so I am all set to buy another today.   We are going to H&R Block today at 11 am to do taxes. I hope we get a lot of money back. Money which we will use to get a new place to live or a new car. If we don't have enough for both I don't know what we will do :O(  Still the prettiest...

      Today was interesting. I went to see Nan, my nurse at Bridgeway, the place I go to for therapy, and had a great session. I am thinking that soon my meds dosage will go up. Also, I went out to return videos and ended up getting more. I do so love videos :O) Today, I also went out with my friend Aimee and her kids, we stopped by ShopKo, a local store, and picked up a few things. I ended up buying Shawn's sis a Jimmie Johnson Matchbox car because I remembered that she was a fan of his.  Aimee got Ben a Ricky Rudd car. Aimee is having trouble with her bf and is planning on leaving him. He is an abusive slob and I'll be glad when she's rid of him. I also told Aimee not to tell anyone I had money. I have been hustling, no not that way, for a little cash.  You know, helping people on the street and that sort of thing. I saved up all that dough and decided to shop. I bought Shawn a card and a Popular Science mag. I have been mean to him and want to make it up to him somehow.  I feel like with as a**holish as his family has been in the past if they knew I had money they would try and take it from me.  Still the prettiest...

      I bet your ticked, dear reader, because I skipped a day or so. I have found, as I have said earlier, that it is not neccassary to keep this journal daily, in fact I may even make it a public blog, but that won't be until later.  Yesterday, I awoke late and went to sleep late. I enjoyed yesterday immensely, except for the brief spat I had with Shawn. What about, you ask? It is not important :OP. Well today we plan on going to the Jamison Center, a local place, to see if they actually do have lawyers there who can help with my Disability/SSI case. I hope they do. We are running on "E" in the car, James, we really need to get me a source of income.  Also, we cannot go to Galesburg Dinner Theatre today because we have no money and the aforementioned problem with the car. Also as I said before, we really need to get me a source of income :O(  Well, until tomorrow or whenever...

       Well kiddies, It's Valentine's Day and all is well. I actually got so much good rest today I don't know what to do :O)! Shawn did have to work today, but he got off early because he switched with someone at work. We went out and got movies today, despite the fine and the fact that we still have overdue movies out :O)  I love Shawn very much and cannot wait to walk down the aisle to become his husband. By then I hope his family is mature enough or at least calm enough not to ruin the occasion.  Well, kiddos that is all I have to report I think. See you on the flipside...LOL

      I just finished watching a movie called " urlLink Soldier's Girl".  It was about the soldier Barry Winchall. Mr. Winchell was killed for his love of Calpernia Addams, a transgendered person he met at a bar called "Visions", which one of the two perpertrators of his death took him too! This movie affected me in ways I can't even comprehend.  I feel as if a well of emotions from deep inside has suddenly ruptured and all of it is trying to come out at once. I have only felt this strange one other time and that was when I first heard of Matthew Sheperd.  I want to devote myself to my church and to the LGBT cause so that nothing like these heinous and evil crimes happens to another soul...  This is a vow I swear onto the God & Goddess!! So Mote It Be!!  P.S.   Apparently, I may not be forgetting to write here. I know I wrote in here on Feb 12th yet the computer says that I didn't.

      Today was another quiet day. I had homework from therapy, but I forgot what it was. I will have to ask tomorrow. I don't want them thinking that I am not trying to get better. So the new meds make me very sleepy and calm. I was actually very relaxed yesterday and today. It was a miracle LOL! Have some movies to watch so I won't be on all night  I think.

      I went to therapy today and I was so tired because of my meds that I was literally falling asleep talking with the lady. I spoke to my mother today also. She said that my middle sister Tereasa was acting up again. Teresea is off. She was deprived of oxygen or something in the womb. I didn't get to go to Tuesday night dinner club. I am a little miffed about that, but I guess thats life.  Nothing else happened today so I guess thats it...

      Today was interesting. I went to Galesburg in an attempt to find steady work. When we arrived at the Unemployment Office we found it to be closed, which is not shocking seeing as how today is Saturday and all, so we took off to the Mall to try my luck there. No dice :O(. Most of the places I had already filled at apps at and they were not hiring. The other places had electronic apps, but we did not have enough time to go to them all due to the fact that Shawn, we all remember who that is right? :O), had to work this evening.  So we ran our other errands there and headed on home. Home was not so bad because everyone went off to do their own thing. I did have to wash a buttload of dishes in the sink though. I wonder what their going to do when Shawn and I move? Oh, well, Not my worry :O)  We also purchased a webcam today (for $30) and it kicks a**! Well at least I hope it does. I have not actually used it yet :O( I practically had to nag the darn thing out of Shawn!! LOL I just hope his family does not try and take the webcam from me. I will have to remind them that it is mine and they cannot have everything they want...Unlike Shawn I do not cave into the demands of bullys nor do I allow them to take what they want!  Oh, well I guess that is all for now...

      Well, It would seem that I have missed some days writing here and I never realized it :O(  Today was not bad at all. I had very little contact with anyone and actually feel rested right now. I have homework from therapy which I still have not started, but soon I will. It is merely a list of things that I I can do to help me relax. I also have a journal I have to do, but I will start that when I get the meds from the Doctor. I can't wait till Shawn and I move.  I am considering dropping my Republican friends simply on the basis that they have become a**holes about their political affilliations and have begun to look down their noses at everyone else.  I am tired of having to take other peoples abuse and drama, but I know I will go on tolerating it simply because I am not an angry person, although I hae at many times worn that mask.  Howard Dean appeals to me as the next President. He seems to care what others think and feel regardless of their political affilliations.  Well, I think that is enough for today...

      Well this is interesting...I am actually adding to the previous post. I was quietly sitting here where I live working on the computer when I heard a commotion coming up through the floorboards. So, Thinking that something had happened to my nephew I went to investigate and I saw Nathan, Ben's, brother and a girl named Moriah speaking near the door.   So I calmly ask what was happening and Moriah pretty much tells me off. So I kicked her out of the house. Being the dumb b*tch that she is she goes outside and gets Ben to come in and yell at me. He tells me that I better never throw his f*cking friends out and some other bullsh*t and then proceeds to threaten me with a punch in the face if I wasn't holding his son, who by the way, was screaming and crying and walked over to me.   I'm sorry, Did I hear this guy right? Because I could have sworn I lived here too!! In addition, his own wife told me if anyone who didn't live here, i.e. caused trouble, then I should toss them out which I did. So what is he going to punch her in the face too? A**hole!  I understand that I don't have a regular source of income like them and cleaning and that pays my way, but I am technically disabled and I am nobody's b*tch!!  I told my boyfriend tonight that I don't know if we can stay together if this is how it is going to be forever. Honestly, I don't want to be in this situation, but I do love him more so than the world...   His family and their friends treat us like sh*t and then try to  justify it with bullsh*t excuses! I hate it here and I wish I hadn't come here....  I had my own life before this and living in and near Chicago, instead  of a podunk town like Monmouth, it won't be hard to do so again...

      Today was another slow day with the exception of the fact that when I awoke I attempted to clean the house and was stopped by Jen who said that she didn't want me to feel like I had to clean up after them...  Which is odd because I already feel that way!!  Other than that everybody did their own thing and pretty much left me alone, which was fanfreakintastic!!  Oh!, BTW I discovered that Jen and Ben are fu*king us over in Animal Crossings. What did I expect? Something better..., but with this "family" I am often disappointed...  I know you, gentle reader, may not see a problem seeing as how Jen owns the game, but if you think about it, if they would lie about this, what else would they lie about?....  Still the prettiest...

      Yesterday was a tired day. I was awake for two days straight and very tired. Speaking of tired, I had to cut my session with Susan today short because I was just to tired to continue. I started taking my meds at night so that I can get on a normal, or as normal as possible, sleep cycle. I also have to make another appointment to see Nan.  The meds also make me hungry more often. I think this is why people gain weight while taking the drugs. The more you eat the more weight you gain :O( I guees this is a good thing because I was underweight before taking the meds.   We went to Galesburg today to pick up the new meds. We also ran errands and stuff like that.  No problems from Shawn's family at all. I think they are just waiting for us to leave so they are being nice to us till then.  TTFN...

      Yesterday was okay. I went over to the new place to get the things we had already took over there organized. I got scared by a group of boys who waled past me to the front of the building. Since they scared me I will check the apartment again tommorow to make sure that everything is okay. The reason I am going to check the apartment is because they gave me a bad feeling as they passed. I am afraid of a break in. I know it sounds silly, but I am just liked that.  Therapy has been helping with my anxeity, but I still have little attacks every now and then. Speaking of therapy I am all out of meds. Nan got sick that one day and was unable to fill my prescription. Speaking of Nan I over slept today and missed my appointment. I know, bad Elvin, bad :O(  Tommorow we will hopefully go to Galesburg to the Bridgeway there to pick up my meds. I need them :O(.  I don't know why I am the way I am. Maybe I was dealt too many wrong hands in life? I know that is no excuse for me, but it's all that I have.  Shawn's family didn't give me any grief today which is good. I am still glad we are moving out on our own though. That brings me to the question of Shawn and I's sex life. We have not had relations in a while.   Maybe tommorow we will.  TTFN...

      Nothing much happened yesterday. We went over to the new place and took Sox, the dog, with us. Shawn had a problem with it, but it turned out fine. She can even visit the new place, but she just can't live there :O( We signed the lease today and Tom is going to mail us a copy for our records. We ended up missing Aimee, the girl who is going to give us a sofa, today. We will meet her tomorrow.  Looking for ways to grow my MSN group. It has a small following, but I want to make it larger. Mother Nighthawk suggested more flash, but won't that just make it cheap?  I suggested to Shawn that we get two internet connections when I get a job so that we won't have to worry about sharing a computer and connection when I get a new job. He was not too keen on the idea. He refused to use one of the computers so it would be a waste of money.  I need a job.   TTFN...

      Yesterday was fun. We finally started moving stuff into the apartment. We need to do another days worth of moving before we are all settled in. All that is really left is the stuff in our room on G Street. Once that is moved it's on to worry about the bills.  Speaking of bills, We are getting Cable installed on the 5th. Although,  the guy I talked to said he would try to get them out earlier than that to do the installation. I wanted to get Showtime and HBO, but it will have to wait till I get my own money coming in :O(  No problems with Shawn's family. They have been rather quiet. I think they know they can no longer be the same way because without us to blame for everything they, Shawn's sister and her family, are next in line to be the whipping boys of the family.

      Yesterday was another okay day. I slept through it not waking up until late afternoon. I will have to modify when I start taking my meds so that I can be awake during the day so I can do a job search. Money is tight now and it will become even tighter as we move into the apartment.  I am calling this week to finish getting all the utilities turned on in the apartment. This will bankrupt us for a while so I am going to have to modify my smoking as well. On the bright side food is not an issue. I will be putting Shawn on my LINK card so that we will at least have a way to get food. We will have to start shopping at Aldi and other low cost stores.  Shawn says that there are programs we can use to help us get by for as long as we keep the apartment. I hope we qaulify for this assistance because we will really need it. Later today, after Shawn is finished with his work meeting, we are going to start moving furniture and stuff into the new place. It will probably take us all day or most of it.   Shawn is also working on a brochure for the church so that we can pass it out to folks who might be interested. He says although the primary mission of the church is not to get money, it will be a welcome side effect.  TTFN...

      Yesterday was boring. I didn't get to go any where or do anything. I did watch "Gothika".  That movie was plenty scary :O) I loved it! I am in serious need of a life.  Shawn did apparently write up some stuff for the church that I am going to use. I still have to get the tax stuff for the church, but it hasn't come yet. I have to check the post office box soon.

      Yesterday was a bust. Shawn and I argued over him telling his boss our new address even though there is the possibility that she will retaliate against us for living in Tom's, our landlord's, apartments.   Ok, background story is that Shawn's boss is a cast iron b*tch who has no life so she expects the people who work for her to have no lives too. Tom, an assistant manager at Shawn's job, quit due to the awful amount of stress at the place. Kim, Shawn's boss, dislikes Tom so she may punish us to get to him. She may cut Shawn's hours. B*tch!! I really need to find a job so that Shawn can quit working at that horrible place.  It seems that Shawn's Mom bought us, read: Shawn, groceries for the apartment. His family and friends have made it abundantly clear that I am of no importance to anyone other than Shawn. I will be glad when we get moved into the new place because that will change...I promise you that!  Other than that nothing exciting happened ...

      Well, we didn't get to move any furniture into the apartment yesterday because the lady at the storage facility wouldn't cut the lock until Shawn's mother showed up in person to have it done. This is odd because Shawn has payed the bill for the place on more then one occassion :O( So Saturday is when we will be moving things in :O)  Yesterday we got movies and had a rather pleasant night. We also went to our Tuesday dinner club. All in all a good night. At the dinner club a friend suggested we start doing weddings and that to earn an extra buck. Shawn's seems to like this idea although my stage fright kicked in the moment it was mentioned :O(  I have to get a new belt because the one I have now is ripping in two places...not good.

      Well, Yesterday was great. We decided to move furniture into the apartment later today. We have most of the large furniture items taken care of. We will still need to purchase a bed. I want to see if Grandparents McBride will let us take the bed we have been sleeping, as well as other things, on. Shawn seems to think they will say no, but considering whats been done on it, I think they will just give it to us. If not the whole thing then most likely the mattress :O)  Have not had any problems out of his family lately. I think it is because they know we are leaving April 1st and they have tofigure out who is going to be their new whipping boys. I can't wait till we move. I want to see this little alliance they have come crumbling down when they start becoming dicks to each other.  Got a picture of Ben's penis. I am going to put it in a password protected part of my site. I am just wierd like that :O)  I get to go get movies today too :O)  TTFN...

      Yesterday was an interesting day. I found out that Shawn's family thought we were just going to up and move without telling them. Why they needed to know we were going to move after all the shit they put us through living here is beyond me.  What? Are they thinking now that there is a new place for them to try and control? Well, If it is then they have a rude wake up call coming. That place is   mine   and Shawn's house, not just Shawns. I will not tolerate the behavior they demonstrated here at my house.  Took a look at the backyard again when we stopped over there today. I have to re-think my plans for a garden because the space I can use is oddly shaped. Oh, Well I am sure it will be ok.  Other then what I already wrote there is no problems to report.  See you later...

      Yesterday was a good day. Except Shawn and I had a bit of a disagreement over calling the landlord. He was expecting the landlord to be resting today, but I knew he wasn't. Of course, He stopped by the building and did a few things, but did'nt get much work done. I was upset because I could have signed the lease today and gotten a few more questions out of the way. Shawn was in a bad mood for the rest of the evening.  We need to get into the storage, Shawn and his familiy's, to get some of Shawn's old furniture out. It seems that his sister and Mom both lost their keys to the facility so we will have to get the lock cut off apparently in order to get what we need.  Shawn had some reservations about getting new furniture from the Salvation Army store, but I want stuff that is uniquely ours. So the next time his family decides to get their panties in a twist we have stuff that they cannot take away from us.  After we get settled into the new place I plan to re-double my efforts to find either employment or a good lawyer willing to take on my disability case so that I too can pay for things and buy the things we need for the apartment.  Well, thats all folks...

      Well it is official! At 6:02 pm yesterday I became an Uncle again. My oldest little sister Nancy had her baby. They gave her a long a** name though :O)  This is the third time I am an Uncle with my sister Teresa having her baby last year and my other sister Jen, Shawn's sister, having her baby last year as well.  I know Shawn and I will have kids when we're ready. I want kids, but I am willing to wait till he is ready also. We need to be more stable financially and in maturity before we take on that responsibility.  Shawn's family knows about the apartment now, although I thought they knew all along. I hope this won't be a problem, but with this family it just might be.  Still the prettiest...

      Yesterday was good, but boring. Everyone else left to do their own thing, but me. I got left all alone. Well, Except for Shawn's mom and her boyfriend who were asleep in their room. I need a life badly.  We will probably do some shopping for new furniture as soon as next week. I hope to get as much as we possibly can before the 1st of April because thats when I hope to move into the new place.  Other than that there are no problems or for that matter anything else to report today :O(  See you later...

      Yesterday was good with the exception that Nan, my nurse, went home sick Tuesday and did'nt fill my perscription. We went all the way to Galesburg to get it and it was'nt done, but I understand she was sick and all.  We also went over and checked out furniture prices at the Salvation Army store there in Galesburg. We will be going back, hopefully, on Monday or Tuesday to purchase stuff for the new place. We get to move in on the first so we need to have everything done by then.  I got books on plants from the library to help plan out my garden. I want to have a small low maintanence garden. I want maximum plantage with minimum effort. This is not laziness, what it is is the simple fact that ,with my arthritis, I want to minimize the time I spend on my hands and knees on the ground. Hey, no smart a** comments! LoL  Well that is all...

      Today was great :O) I have confirmed that we can move into the apartment now, if we wanted too, but we are still going to wait till next month so that we can get more furniture. We pay our first rent payment on April 6th :O) It is so groovy because not only do we have an apartment, but I can have a garden and pets and all kinds of stuff :O)  Speaking of pets, we, Shawn's sister, her husband and I, watched the Cat in the Hat movie today. I am going to name my rats Thing 1 & Thing 2! The cat will be named "Cat" or "Seuss".  Therapy went well. I brought in some pages from my Blog for Susan, my therapist, to read and she wants me to continue to bring them in :O) I feel like I am getting better all the time now.  Well, I believe thats all folks!...

      Yesterday was good. We stopped over at the new place to finish up cleaning. Minor cosmetic cleaning so it did'nt take us as long as the first time we went over. We are now ready to start moving in furniture, but we will have to visit some thrift shops and the like to get it. I am so in love with the new place.  I will be getting new pets of course, once money un-tightens :O). I am probably going to get rats, but we will have to see. Shawn is not to keen on the idea of rodents. He says that they either stay in a roll ball or in their cages, but one must handle pets in order for them to respond to you.  Once we move into the new place I expect less problems with Shawn's family and friends. We probably won't see each other that often and we will be the ones paying the cost to be the boss so any more of this "Elvin Doese'nt Count" behavior will be checked at the door or they won't come in.  Well, I guess thats all for today...

We are going to wait to move in till we have a decent amount of furniture and stuff to call it our home.  Other than that nothing much is happening. I am going to job search later on today and all this week. If I do not find a job soon we are going to go and try for Disability/SSI.  Still the prettiest...

      Today was an interesting day. I watched a animated show called "This Just In". I found it to be funny, but I also found it to be a vehicle for the Republican Party and conservatives to spread their message. I have no problem with conservatives, being a liberal that is, but when you encroach on peoples lives and try to tell them how they should live thats where I draw the line.  The thing that makes this country great is the diversity of it's people and the freedom to express said diversity. In my opinion, conservatives and Republicans want to take that from us. They want everyone to ascribe to the same things they do. Truthfully, People may or may not be conservative in their hearts, but there are differing degrees to it.  As I said before, My opinion is that life should just be lived, without drama, live and let live. Eat, drink and be merry, for tommorow we may all die.  Nothing happened with Shawn's family today, but a friend of ours let us know about two apartments he has for rent. We are meeting him tommorow to discuss the details.

Of Course, I did sleep most of the day away :O)   We do need to stop over at the Housing Authority today so that we can get the ball rolling on our own place. Shawn's Mom copped an attitude about dish soap being left out, but no one cops an attitude when I have to constantly wash their dishes all day do they?  I can't wait till we move!

      Today was another one of those days. Shawn mentioned our sex life every chance he got and even tried to bring it up after I dropped hints that I didn't wish to speak of it. I am getting very stressed with him lately. I understand why he does what he does, but he needs to understand that I do not wish to deal with that issue at this time.  I have to make copies of my Blog for therapy. I think it will help my counselors in their diagnosis of me. I tried again to get a counselor to look at it while I was there, but they again refused for ethical reasons. Hmmm, How is it unethical to hear me speak the words to them, but they can't read them with my permission?  I asked about them helping us move to our own place, but they simply said try the Housing Authority :O( It is hard to get a place there. I know we can no longer stay here. His family is going to Hell in a handbasket and they are attempting to take us with them.  I downloaded iTunes to download the free songs I won buy buying Pepsi products, but the d*mn program is/was slow as hell. Neil suggested I use Kazaa, which is a virus nightmare, or another program called IMesh, which I will research later.  We went to the Tuesday Night Group and had fun, but the group was small tonight.   We have to get Speedy, my turtle, a new bulb for her tank.  Still the prettiest...

      We got the DVD Player from our friend. I think that Shawn's family had a problem with that. I will have to remind myself to look for any sign of this in the future. I really don't like living here. We called about an apartment, but it was a little expensive at this time.  I need to curb my love of pets because we are running out of room for them. I  really  want a rat, but there is no space for it here. I have to wait till the current pets die :O(  Neil is getting me interested in LARP, Live Action Role Play, again. I would very much like to get involved in a game locally, but there isn't one as far as I know :O(  Other than that there isn't much to report...

      Today the only problem was yet another attempt by Shawn and I to have a peaceful night together. As usual his family f*cked it up. His sister and her family came home mid-way through one of the movies we were watching and decided that we were through watching movies, even though we were not. Before we could say anything they took the television and DVD Player over and we were out of luck. So, We are going to buy our own DVD Player and that'll be that.  We do have the option of borrowing a friend's player which I will do tommorow so that we can actually veiw the DVDs we rented. Shawn and I are sick and tired of the d*mn double standard that is allowed to go on in this house. With the exception of meeting Shawn and a few other things, this whole move has been a nightmare.  His family is more f*cked up then mine and thats saying something. I am sick and tired of this sh*t so I am going to see if Bridgeway, the place I go for therapy, will help us move. We already have our eye on a place, but we do not have the money, we think, to actually move.

      Today was good with the exception of having our quiet night ruined. We re-newed some movies and ordered pizza so that we could have a quiet night together. Ben had left for the night, or so we thought, with the baby.  Needless to say he came home with a pack of people in tow and they took over the living room. We were forced to postpone our quiet night. Which is annoying because I was finally going to give Shawn some!  Oh, I am getting tired of the whole cleaning situation. They only clean up after themselves like once or twice in a month. It is pretty nasty. Getting tired of being a maid!  Oh, Well just more fuel to the "We Need To Move" fire. Other than that the day was great :O)  I talk to my sister Nancy today. Her baby is due in like two weeks. It is another girl. I was hoping for another nephew, but oh well!

      Today started with me writing a note to Shawn explaining how I feel about things that have happened between us lately. It was all mushy and stuff and I am not good with the mushy stuff.  We ended up watching two movies, which were good by the way, and he went to sleep.  There was no problems today with the family. Thank Goodness! Cause if there had been I would have snapped. It's not that I don't like them, it is that I feel they don't like me.  I am looking further into Wicca, trying to consalidate and better understand the path that I am on. I know that I am eclectic in my beliefs, but beyond that there is nothing. I want to better be able to explain to others what I believe.

      I had a good day today. I had very little if any trouble. Except for Shawn feeling like I lied to him about being horny. I told him if he is asleep and I am awake at night what is a guy to do? In truth the meds do curtail my sex drive even more so then it was. I don't want him to feel like he is unattractive, but he does regardless of what I do.  So I have decided to buy a rat next time I get a pet. I will keep it in the room unless it is being carried around with me :O) I just hope that the sound based pest control doesn't affect it negatively, you know?  Ben had his ex and their child over today. The girl is very cute now. I thought she was ugly from the pictures he showed me, but I guess she just doesn't take good pictures.  I miss my family and my Mom nor my sister have called me yet. I wonder when I will be able to see them again? I know from a messege my sister left, she got out of the hospital recently. Why was she in the hospital?

Should  because I am not used to speaking good of myself.  I also need more activity in my life :O( Without activity I become a bored boy....Elvin bored is not pretty...

      I hope today goes well. We are supposed to go to a bar all the way in the boondocks for our dinner club tonight. I didn't like the look of the place when we went there on accident last Teusday. It looked like the kind of place where LGBT people get beat up. A real redneck kind of place.  Thinking about asking the doctor to put me back on Lithium. At least I know Lithium. This drug Zyprexa is new to me. I didn't like Lithium's side effects so that is a big negative for that.  Home life is going well. Not a peep out of the others which is good. No drama :O) I wonder if this Blog is turning into a rant disguised as a diary? LOL   Shawn found out about me masturbating even though I say I am not in the mood. What is a guy to do when he is horny at night and his boyfriend is asleep? I personally love maturbation LOL   My polyamorous side is returning which, in this relationship, is a bad thing. I want to stay with Shawn, but he is in no way poly and I don't want him to think he has to be to be with me.  So far, as far as I know, Neil, the English stud, is the only one to read my Blog. Quite frankly if he were not getting married and I were single I would sleep with him in a heartbeat. I am such a tramp LOL  Still the prettiest...

If I knew then, what I know now...  I am not so sure I would have moved here...

      Yesterday was okay. I went to work and it just generally sucked. I have to learn how to mow or else I will be replaced :O( I know how to mow with a regular mower, but not with a riding one. Oh, Well I dislike this job anyway.  Speaking of people being replaced I think Scott, the special guy at work, might have been fired yesterday. I feel bad for him, but not to bad as my head is next on the chopping block after him.  I even burned myself again on that d*mn trimmer!  Well, Nuff Said...

      Yesterday sucked royally. I found out a guy at work that I liked is a bigot, he hates GLBT people. Being gay myself I find his words offensive, but cannot reveal that I am gay at work. The bossess say if I have a problem at work that I will be terminated. I think this is because the other guys have seniority over me, but you never know.  Everything else at work that could go wrong did go wrong. I had problems putting the string on the trimmer and it even messed up on me quite a few times. We even had to trim all day. I also got a small burn from the trimmer motor :O( Although with the help of the bigot and another guy we got alot of trimming done :O)  I think they are used to mowing first then trimming as then you can see where the mower did'nt cut. Oh Well, Sh*t happens. I am going to use this job as a temp job till another oppertunity raises it's head. Then I am going to put in my two weeks and be done with it forever.  I don't get paid till the 7th of May and I am dearly looking forward to that day :O)  Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was a quiet day. We went to G Street to do laundry, but we ended up having to wait for Shawn's sister to finish a few loads. Although, Shawn's mom lended us a hand and did ours for us.  Today was rough at work. I ended up damaging a stone, but I told them, Jack and Chuck (my bosses), that I did, but they already had saw and heard the whole thing. I was very nervous today because Chuck showed up. He had to help me get my mower unstuck :O(  Shawn is not enjoying his job very much. I think he never did, but he does it because work is very hard to find here. I think he should look for another job.  Neil and Kelly seem to be on the outs. I feel sorry for him, but don't know to make it, the situation, better.  Well, Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was spent relaxing after a tough day at work on Friday. Today is being spent preparing for the tough week coming up. I will be sticking with this job until something better comes along. Preferably something without too much physical strain :O)  Will be getting up early tomorrow so that I can hopefully catch people on-line and let them know that I am working so that they don't think I abandoned them :O)  Oh, Shawn and I had sex this morning after along time of not having it. It was okay for me, but he wanted to go for a second time :O)  Nuff Said...

      Well, Yesterday was my first day at work. It was very hard, but I will continue to work there until I find something better. I basically mow a cemetary and whatever else the City of Monmouth owns.   From 7:30 am to 12 noon I trim the grass around the gravestones then from 12 noon to 1pm I take lunch. Then from 1pm till 4:30 I mow with a John Deere Riding mower. There are two little breaks somewhere in there, but I don't remember the exact times. Also, I do not work Saturdays unless we miss a day during the week, but as a rule we don't work Saturdays.  My arm muscles hurt so it is kind of tough to type, but I am sure I'll get used to it :O)  Well, Nuff said...

      Yesterday was kind of dull. I got my call to come into work today. I am now going to be working from 7:30 am to 4:30 pm. Not my ideal schedule, but it's money. I ended up setting the clock last night for 5 am. I thought I would need that extra two hours to wake up, talk to Internet friends, and then have enough time to wake Shawn up so that I can get to work.  I am excited though to have the chance to work again. Now when people look at me I won't feel like such a loser or a kid. I plan to pay off as much bills as possible with my first check depending on when I get paid :OD  I have not heard from Neil this morning. I assume he has today off from work.  Well, Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was a super day :O) I got a call for a 9 am interveiw with that guy from City Hall yesterday, but the interveiw was today. I thought the interveiw went well and was told that he and his second in command would make a decision after they interveiwed 2 more people...  I got the job!!!! I am to report to work tomorrow at 7:30 am to start the paperwork and all that stuff :O) This of course means I'll have to adjust my Internet time, but I am sure everyone will understand :O)  I am just so happy. This means that now life won't be so hard on me and Shawn. We will be able to do things like everyone else like shopping and stuff. I will be sure to post what happened on my first day as soon as I can tommorow :O)  Well, Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was fun. We went to Galesburg to our dinner group. We had much fun, but the pizza wasn't as good as expected. At least I should say I had much fun. Shawn apparently is not having  any  fun. I just read his blog.  I wanted to get the new Eddie Murphy movie yesterday so I asked for it. Granted I should have asked for the money before he went to work, but I didn't think of it. I kept asking him to take me to get it when he got home, but he wouldn't because he wanted to relax. Plus, He says that bills soak up all the money which I do understand. Which is also why I put them in my name, but he is also on the bills, so that if something doesn't get paid it goes on my credit and not his. He'll come away from not paying the bills free and clear, but I won't.  Next we move on to me wanting to see my family. What he doesn't get is I missed them. No one told me that if I moved down here then I would never see them again which is basically how it has been. I talked to them on the phone, but it is not the same. When I get a job, I am going to visit my family regardless of what Shawn says.  When I get a job, I will fend for myself. Apparently Shawn wants me to depend on him, but what he doesn't realize is that I wasn't raised that way. I can buy my own things and stuff.

      Yesterday was a little busy. I went out and job searched for a while only to be told the same old thing. I am starting to go crazy.  I also went to therapy with Nan. I think I am starting to get better :O) Each of my therapy sessions is now two weeks away from each other. I am ecstatic that I am doing so well when just last year I wasn't :O)  Nuff said...

      This blog is for the 18th. It was a pretty dull day. I went shopping again with Shawn and then watched the tele.  Now you may wonder how I am looking for a job and yet I lay about the apartment like a lazy sh*t. The answer is simple. I have already put an application in at every place in this podunk town. Everytime I call them or walk in and ask about my application they say come back in a month or they'll get back to me :O(  My birthday is next week. I saved enough to get a cake and ice cream. Some people may think that a 26 year old having cake and ice cream on their birthday is childish....  ...SCREW YOU IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!!  Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was pretty boring. I went shopping with Shawn and then proceeded to lay around the apartment and watch the tele.  My birthday is coming on the 29th of this month. I will be 26 years old. I am planning on having a birthday party, but I don't know who to invite. All my other friends and family live near Chicago or are on the Internet. I have made some friends down here, but they are really other people's friends. I don't know what to do :O(  I am trying to slow down on my smoking. The obstruction in my lungs can't possibly be happy about the amount of smoke I inhale on a daily basis :O(  TTFN...

      Yesterday was a pretty boring day. I watched the tele and ate a lot, but little if anything else. I really need a life :O)  I did find out though that mine is the only application that the guy from the City Of Monmouth has so if someone quits or gets fired from his fully staffed crew I will be the one he calls :O) I need this job so bad it's not funny.   Speaking of jobs, the bills have started to arrive. I don't know how we are going to pay them, but they are coming in. The three we have so far are Power/Gas, Cable, and Car Insurance. I hope we can pay it all.  We made a pit stop over to Shawn's family's place and found that Ben and Jen had taken our old room. We also found that the house was sloppy and dirty. It looks like the in fighting in the clique they had going when Shawn and I lived there will soon start :O)  TTFN...

      Todays entry will be for the 13th through yesterday. It seems I missed a day or two again. Oh Well, At least I remembered now.   Well, There actually isn't much to tell. We got our Public Aid so we went shopping. Decided to start shopping at the cheap store rather then the normal stores because prices are so high. I know thats a no brainer, but I thought of it yesterday.  Shawn and I are both sick now. I know I probably picked up his cold. Even Van Gogh has a cold :O( It doesn't help that the apartment is ice cold either. I hope we get better soon.  Speaking of Shawn I owe him sex as soon as we both get better :O)  On to the job search, We are still searching for me a job. Shawn is applying for a managers position at work. He turned in his resume to the boss, but something tells me he won't get it :O(  TTFN...

      Yesterday we went to church. I really enjoyed myself, but had to leave early as Shawn has been sick for a while. Everyone was really nice and happy to see us. Those reactions are part of the reason I enjoy being a UU. Everytime I enter a UU church I feel like I am home.  Spike TV is currently running DS9 as a series so I will be able to see the episodes that I missed the first time around. I really love Star Trek and all it's spin offs :O) I wish they would start a series about Starfleet Academy. I would love to see what really happens at that place.  The apartment is still too cold for my taste, but to turn up the heat would be rather expensive. Expensive because we are out here in the boonies instead of near a metropolitan area. We still need to get furniture and supplies, but that will come in due time.  I got to IM with Don, a guy from our Tuesday night group, he is a little cutie :O) He needs a boyfriend though. I hope he finds one :O)  Now about the job search. When I checked Shawn's e-mail, I know, I know bad Elvin bad, for the e-mail from ICW, Internet Call Wave, I discovered an e-mail from his father that stated that he knew it was frustrating that I didn't have a job. He also asked some questions about me. I still have no job, but I am filling out applications.  I think Shawn is getting frustrated with me, but I don't know if this is just my anxeity and paranoia taking over or I am actually reading him right.  Well, i think thats enough for now...  TTFN...

      Yesterday was another quiet day. I watched the end (?) of the DS9 marathon. I really enjoyed seeing all those shows again. Now they, Spike TV, are adding DS9 to their regular line-up :O)  I have been feeling a little sick lately. I'm sure it's just a cold, but I dislike being sick. Shawn and Van Gogh are sick also, but Shawn is much worse than mine or Van Gogh's. I hope we get better soon.  Later today I may walk over to see Zak. I love that little guy :O)  Well, thats all for now...  TTFN...

      Yesterday was a quiet day. I watched the DS9 marathon all day. As I will be today. We have to pay rent tomorrow. We need to get a rent reciept so that Public Aid will be santisfied.  Van Gogh is a very poopy kitty. He went through a large bag of litter to quickly. I love him, but he needs to learn how to use the litter box effectively LoL  Speaking of pets, I want more, but Shawn is not to keen on the idea. I grew up with pets and am prepared to spend the time to care for them. I must honor Shawn's decision and not get anymore.  Shawn's mom bought us a chocolate cheesecake yesterday. It is quite delicious, but I can't help wondering if she got it too make up for her terrible treatment of us when we lived there?  Well, back to my marathon...  TTFN...

      Yesterday was a good day. I watched DS9 all day, except when I went to turn in some applications and then to Public Aid. We have to go back to Public Aid today so I am hoping that an episode I least like comes on so that I won't miss anything :O)  Our first phone call came through yesterday as well. It was from Shawn calling to say that he was closing last night. The phone is very shrill and annoying, but it is all we have.  Well, thats all for now...  TTFN...

      Yesterday was the final push to get everything moved into the new place. I am santisfied with the results :O) The new place needs a bit of polish, but it will do.  We even watched the final chapter of the Matrix Trilogy. We liked the movie, but were disappointed with the ending.  Today is spent watching DS9 and enjoying some relaxation away from stressful G St. We haven't even recieved our first phone call here in the apartment.  Turned in my stuff for my food stamps, but now we have to find Shawn's pay stubs for the last thirty days or my stamps will be withheld till we do. Tonight we will look.  Well, back to Star Trek...

      Yesterday was a pretty boring day. We moved the tele over to the apartment so I didn't get any entertainment :O( I even missed the first episodes of the DS9 marathon and will probably miss the episodes today too :O( It's a good thing I have seen most of them or I'd be p.o.'d.  Shawn gave me some money yesterday and, without thinking about the fact that he wanted change, I spent it all. I asked Ben if he had a dollar at Casey's, the gas station, by G St, and he totally said "No!" with an attitude. He embarrased me in front of everyone there. It's ok though because I know things have a way of returning to a person. The laws of Karma.  Well, enough about my boring day...  TTFN...

      Yesterday was okay. We moved even more stuff into the apartment yesterday. Our room at G St. is becoming very empty :O) When we arrived yesterday we were greeted by Van Gogh and the worst smell ever!! Apparently Van Gogh either hasn't got the whole litter thing down, as in covering your poop with it, or he really had to go and just could'nt be bothered afterward.  Speaking of the apartment, Shawn's mom got us more groceries and even gave us some appliences. She was acting very nice yesterday...makes me wonder if her behavior is a calm before the storm.  Other than that nothing much happened. As I have said before my life is pretty boring at times.  TTFN...

      Yesterday was an alright day. One of those lazy, slow warm days that seems to last forever.  We went over to the apartment to spend time with Van Gogh and bake cookies. We baked peanut butter cookies which I found out are Shawn's favorites. I am partial to chocolate chip myself.   Van Gogh is a good cat. He is using the litter box which suggest to us that he might have been an inside cat at one point, but was turned out into the street. We are going to get him a check-up soon and ask the vet about his gimpy ear.  Ben and Jen hosted a party of some kind last night. I know because they left the clean up work to somebody else. As usual I really don't expect much from them. It is sad that they choose to live their lives the way they do, but it is no longer my problem.  We have to move some more stuff into the apartment later today. Mostly just boxes and clothes. The pets will be the last thing we move.  TTFN...

      Yesterday was good, there were no April Fool's jokes played as far as I know :O).  I know I didn't play any :O) My birthday is in a few weeks :O)  I went over to the apartment early yesterday to feed Van Gogh, my cat. He is a very good boy. He apparently slept on the loveseat all night, at least thats where I found him when I arrived. He has enough food to last until Shawn gets paid again. Speaking of Van Gogh, we think he is a boy, but this will either be comfirmed or denied when we take him to the vet.  Shawn's family didn't give us any problems. I am glad because with the apartment sucking up all our resources I don't think I would have been able to deal :O( Shawn's mom gave him $30 to purchase a phone with. We need two because we have two jacks in the apartment. Shawn only bought one :O( He says it's just temporary till we find the other phones around "G" Street.  TTFN...

      Yesterday was great. I found and captured a stray cat. He is light brown and creme colored. He has green eyes and one ear. We are going to name him after the artist that cut off his own ear.  We also have phone service at the apartment. Anyone wishing for the number can e-mail me and I will decide rather or not to give it too you :O) It took Frontier a long time to get the workman out. Apparently they do troubles first then new hook- ups. The apartment utilities are all turned on except for the cable. The cable rep said that it should be turned on by April 5th, but that she would try to speed the process up.  Now all I need to do is find a job and we will be set...  TTFN...

      Well, Today, Memorial Day, was rather disappointing. I did'nt do much of anything, but watch the tele and nap. Well, not really nap as much as try to nap.  I sent an e-mail yesterday to an old friend's old e-mail address so far I have not gotten a response although the e-mail was not returned by his service. I don't know if that means he got it or that it means that the account is still active and he has not checked it yet.  Shawn worked all day as usual, but it was a bit disappointing since he had Memorial Day off last year. We still have'nt had sex, but since I read his Blog I understand why. I will not pressure him into doing it if he does'nt want too.  The SWF needs to put out it's flyers and such soon. We need to attract other local Pagans to us as soon as possible or I think the church may die :O(  I found out today when we went to G St. that Shawn's mom and her boyfriend plan on getting rid of Shawn's old car. They may only be able to get $100 for it, but I feel that the money, all the money, should go to Shawn since it is his car.  Nine times out of ten though they will keep the cash and probably were not even going to tell Shawn that they were going to get rid of it in the first place. The only way we found out about it was because there is something wrong with a tire on our current car and Shawn wanted to take a tire from his old car.  I am hoping that the rest of the week is filled with jobs calling me. I really need to work. I am not happy just lazing about the apartment like some freeloader.

      Yesterday was a day of introspection. I was thinking of many things like jobs, relationships and moving to another, warmer state.  Today was not a day of introspection, but a day of chores. We went over to G St. and took care of our laundry. We did have to wait a bit till they, Shawn's sister and her family, were done with their stuff.  We did'nt get to church today. Something is wrong with Shawn's mom's van so we could'nt use it :O( I really rather miss being able to get to church on time and enjoy the services.  The children from next door as well as from upstairs are now playing a game of throwing things at each other over the balcony of the apartment upstairs. Shawn and I are not to keen on this as they have already broken quite a bit of the balcony off as well as thrown items off and at the balcony and each other. Once they even hit our window in one of their games.  Just now Shawn says that they threw a glass which shattered on our patio. I heard it, but did'nt see it. I will have to sweep it up in the morning.  I noticed as I write this Blog I can really keep track of my life and see exactally what goes on day to day. I lead quite a different life then I did before and I am still wondering which life is/was better.

      Yesterday was another one of those lazy boring days. I actually did'nt do anything, but watch the tele and try to sleep. I did'nt get much sleep though as I have wisdom teeth coming in and the pain of it all kept me awake till I took some painkillers.  I tried getting more DVDs from the Monmouth College Library, but I have either seen all the one's I am interested in seeing or I have no interest in seeing the others.  We are still waiting for comfirmation of our Food Stamps. We are also running out of food. If the comfirmation is not in the mail today I can only assume it will be here sometime next week.  As far as the job search I am having no luck. I can only assume that they saw that I had been terminated from my last two jobs and decided not to hire me. I just hope I don't have to go another year without work again.

      Yesterday was an okay day. It wasn't bad, but nor was it good. It was a day of hoping a job called and watching movies. I have filled out all the applications I can around this town so now it is just a matter of getting a call back from them.  For the past two days or so I have been raiding the Monmouth College Library for videos, well DVDs, to watch. I have mostly found foriegn films, but they were still quite enjoyable. I plan on going back today as well to see what I can find.  Shawn has gotten onto this habit of not letting me touch him in certain areas. It is quite annoying to want to, but not be able to. How does he expect to get sex by acting like a frigid b*tch?  Oh, The other day the one of the upstairs neighbors who fought all the time moved out. A shame because he was kind of cute ;O)

      Yesterday was a dull day. No calls from jobs nor anyone else. I mostly slept all day having put in applications at just about every place in town.  I got a positive e-mail back from a lady I owe money too. She apparently has been having a hard time with work herself so she understands why I have not paid her.  I also downloaded the newest Yahoo! Messenger. I waited till Shawn got home and asked permission first so that there would'nt be any problems. So far it is working great.  Shawn and I got into a conversation about me not having actual conversations. I enjoy hearing him speak so I rarely say anything but general awnsers when he talks. I have to work on speaking more.  We also got coffee filters so now I can enjoy my coffee!

      Yesterday was a boring day. We turned in the stuff we had to at Public Aid so hopefully we will be getting Food Stamps soon. We should be getting a bit more then we did so that we can actually have food that last the whole month and not half of it.  Shawn and I are doing well, but we still have not had sex. I don't really know if it is because I don't want to or that I have not had the energy to do so.  I found out that after we moved out of Shawn's family's house that they now have to pay rent to live there. Their rent is like $350 for the lot of them. I don't think it is right since they have been living there for so long that the Grandparents would make them pay, but I don't live there so I have no say.  The mailman has been putting our mail in the wrong boxes. I think if it happens again I will have to go to the Post Office and ask that the problem be fixed.

      Yesterday was another slow day. I seem to be having a lot of those lately. Although, When you live in a small town I guess that's what you get.  Still no job or calls from jobs. I am starting to get that frustrated feeling I had before I started working for the City. I will have to keep that secret so as not to stress Shawn out anymore then he already is.  Need to get Speedy, my turtle, and Scruffy, my algea eater, some food, but with no way to get to Galesburg they are sh*t out of luck. Although, I can feed the turtle different foods until such a time that we can get to Galesburg.

      Yesterday was an okay day, but it could have been better. I wish I had a job so that I won't have to sit in the house all day. Although, there is something to be had in relaxation, too much of anything is bad.  I actually missed my therapy appointment today. I overslept during my nap and did'nt wake up in time. Today was another boring day.  Well, I don't think there is anything else to write about today with the exception of the hellacious storm outside and the chance of a tornado in our area.

      Yesterday was a day of rest. I did'nt do much, but watch the tele and hang out with Shawn :O) All in all a good day.  Also, Yesterday there were cops and sherrif's deputies at the apartment building because two of our neighbors, who apparently always fight, got into a rather nasty arguement. No one was arrested as far as I could tell, but Tom, the landlord, said we should call the police if it happens again. I don't think they will be living here much longer :O(  I think when it is warmer and we have more stuff for the apartment we should hold a party for the building so that we can get to know our neighbors.  Today will be spent, hopefully, cleaning the apartment and filling out paperwork for Public Aid. Later I hope to watch the two movies we have before they need to be returned.

      Yesterday was a pretty laid back day. I cashed my last checked then went about paying bills. I don't know how we are going to pay the next round of bills, but we will try.  We made an appointment for Van Gogh, my cat, to go to the vet, but I think we will have to cancel it in order to have more money freed up. I know we need to get him checked out, but we don't have the funds right now.  I hope I get another job soon. I am really worried about not being an equal partner in this relationship. I want to be able to provide for my family. Shawn seems okay, if a little frustrated, with the whole situation.  There is a little light at the end of the tunnel though. Once I re-apply for Public Aid on Monday we will have Food Stamps again. So our food needs will be taken care of. Right now we have only canned veggies to eat and I know that they are getting old fast with Shawn and me.  I really love Shawn. I don't always express it like I should, but with my f*cked up previous relationships who can blame me. No, Thats not quite right. I should be over those things by now. I am going to therapy and taking meds so I should be getting better. I know these things take time, but I am getting impatient with myself.  I had an oppertunity to cheat on Shawn present itself about a month or so ago. Not to worry I turned the guy down. I will not cheat on the man I am going to marry and hopefully spend the rest of my life with.

      Yesterday was a day of returning applications and trying to relax some. It seems more and more that I am finding it hard to quiet the "monkey mind" and truly relax. Like last night I slept sporadically all night. I kept thinking about my ex and all the property he caused me to lose, particularly my RPG books, some of which are out of print now.  The job hunt is going okay. I have not recieved any calls back from the numerous places I applied, but that was how it was when I first moved here and tried to find work.  It is just frustrating to have a bi-polar disorder and have no job to boot.  Well, Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was spent lounging and languishing around the apartment. I don't miss my job, but I do miss the income. What makes this whole situation even more ridiculous is the fact that I should be on Disability/SSI right now instead of trying to find another dead end job.  I have my last check coming on this Friday so I will have to purchase stuff for the pets and pay bills, bills taking precedence.  We finally got to turn our water back on. It seems the plumber fix whatever leak there was, but did'nt turn the water back on.  Shawn seems to want sex more now days. He needs to understand that the flesh on my end is willing, but the spirit is not. Sex used to be such a big part of my life, but not any more.   Well, Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was a weird day. I got sort of a mini interveiw at the local newspaper's office to work in their mailroom. The guy, Dennis, said he would keep me in mind when making his decision. I hope he was'nt pulling my leg on that. I could really use the cash.  We also went to our Tuesday night group and we had fun, except that I got sick in the restaraunt's bathroom :O( I had had a low level headache all day, but it was making me nausious as well.  Evilemail seems to be working again, but I am going to keep using my other two accounts instead of it. I don't need so many e-mail addies.  Well, Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was a day without water, as is today. The person who lives upstairs from us had some sort of leak real bad so Tom, our landlord, had to shut the water off in order to stop it. He called the plumber and he came, but we still have no water.  Still looking for another job. This time I am not going to freak out so much about things because if I can find one job I can find another. The only thing I am worried about is if Shawn's family finds out. They will hold it over my head for a long time.  Went to therapy with the Doctor yesterday evening. She gave me some more meds and inquired after my symptoms and stuff and then sent me on my way.  Other than that there is really not much to write about.

      Yeah, I know this is the first post in a little while. I did'nt post over the weekend because I forgot too, okay? LoL :O)  Nothing much happened over the weekend except we had a scary, grease fire in our kitchen. I thought the whole house was going to burn down, but it went out on its own after several attempts by me to beat it out with a towel.  I have been doing some thinking ever since I lost my job. I think it would be best if Shawn and I moved to Chicago or one of it's suburbs because there are more jobs there. Here there are too many people and not enough jobs to go around. Also, the only places that seem to be hiring are in a completely different town!  Since our car sucks major a** we can't make it to the other town so I am stuck here in Monmouth attempting to fight the other jobless saps for work.  I also saw a movie called "Manic". This movie got me to thinking that really the only thing that stands between the new me and the old me is therapy and pills. without these things the darkness would creep back into my life and I would be evil again. Having this didorder is very stressful. I am glad that Shawn is so understanding and loving.  Well, Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was a bit boring. I can't seem to recall what I did yesterday...  I had to start looking for another job today. I plan on doing two applications a day so as not to get discouraged by the long process of filling them out. I hope to have a new job soon so as to pull my weight around the apartment.  I don't want people thinking that I cannot hold a job. The reason I lost this job is because I had to many accidents and the last one damned near destroyed a riding lawn mower. I accept full responsibility for my actions, but will not have people looking down their noses at me.  I have to fill out all new applications everywhere in town so I hope they bear fruit...

      Yesterday was a slow day. Work seemed to last forever. I am seriously tired and need a full night's rest.  On a darker note, my email (evilemail.com) is now not sending me my e-mails. I don't know if the comp has a virus or if the system itself is the cause, but I will do a virus scan after I log off.  Shawn and I are no longer arguing so at least something good is happening right now. I love Shawn very much and hope to be with him for a very long time.

      Yesterday was one of those days. First off, We got a new package from the cable company that would allow us to veiw Showtime ( Queer As Folk!!). The service man came between 8 am and 10 am, but had to come back as the first box he brought, although straight from the warehouse, had already had purchases for pay-per-veiw on it. So he left and returned from 2 pm to 4 pm with a new box which worked. In fact we watched and episode of QAF last night.  On to work, It sucked. I left the garage around 1:30 so as to get to my therapy appointment, which never happened because the Doctor was out, but before I left Jack, one of my bosses, had to go to the Doctor about a growth on his spleen so we were pretty much unsupervised.  So I took my Doctor's note to City Hall and gave it to Chuck, another boss, and ask to just be allowed to go home which I was, but I have a feeling he wanted me to go back to work :O( This might have an effect later on in my stint with the city, but as long as I can survive this job for another two weeks even if they fire me or I quit I get Unemployement.

      Yesterday was a day of church, family and laundry. We actually got to go to church yesterday. I was very happy that we did because I dislike missing church. Now you might think that because I am a Pagan that this is an oxymoron, but it isn't when you are also a Unitarian Universalist :O)  The family part is when we went to Shawn's Grandparent's place to visit. I was going to just sit in the van while he visited with them, but I was asked inside the home. I know they don't like me, but I think they are making an effort for Shawn's sake. We also saw his family when we went to G St. to do laundry.  Today is going to be a therapy day with Doctor Sachdiva. I will have to leave work early to make it there on time. I have started putting all my appointments for as late as possible so as not to interfere with my job.  Speaking of jobs, there have been no more leads on a new one. As you know I strongly dislike my current job, but if I can hang in there for two more weeks, even if I get fired or quit I will be able to collect Unemployment checks again. Not that I want to quit or get fired, but it is nice to know that we won't be completely helpless if something bad happens.  Well, Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was a dull and boring day. I worked and all through work my thoughts centered on the weekend. I did'nt want to be at work any longer then I had to be. For me this is the first sign that I am tired of a job. When you no longer wish to be there despite having bills and other obligations. Today will be spent relaxing and trying not to think about too much other than that.  Speaking of work though, I found out that there is another bigot there they just hired. He is against gays and blacks. I know not how to handle him. He fussess over my work as if he is a boss, but then tells me that he knows he's no boss and really does'nt care what I do. Although I did see him and the other bigot critiquing my job. So what!? I really don't care. I am there to trim and mow grass not deal with bullsh*t!!  I had to call the bill companies today. I am trying to get extensions on the bills as I did'nt make enough to pay all of them. The cable company has granted an extension till the 23rd. The others I will have to call on Monday and see if they too will be so leniant.  Well, Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was a slow, tedious day. I got to mow a part of the cemetary that apparently even the older, more expirienced guys hate doing. I am still mowing that part. The annoying thing is that there is a lot of small hills and mini valleys that will trap you if you attempt to mow there.   It was extremely hot yesterday too. It felt like you were in a oven or something. I hope my next job is one inside with air conditioning :O) Yes, I am still looking for another job. Why you ask? It's because this one sucks LoL  Well today is payday. I hope my check is good. We need to pay off some bills :O( I want to go to the bar tonight. I did'nt get to on my birthday and not on Cinco de Mayo either.  Well Nuff Said...

      Hmmmm, Yesterday was an okay day. At work we mowed for the day LoL Work is picking up. At least, I think so. Since me and another guy were on the Yard Waste route we missed trimming :O)  Today is Shawn's payday and mine is tomorrow. I hope after bills are paid that I will have some "Me" money left. I want to go shopping and get myself a gift since I am working and all now.  Shawn and I are still in our rough patch. I think it is mostly due to the fact that we have not had sex in a while :O) Perhaps tonight after work we will. I don't know. I have not been "in the mood" for a while :O(  Well, Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was another therapy day. I went to see Susan. She feels that I am doing better and we decided that sessions should only last half an hour from now on unless I have some other stuff to talk about.  Work still sucks, but it is getting a little better. I found out that we get, assuming I stay there that long, layed off around Oct. 31st. I don't plan to be there that long, but you never know :O( My mowing skills have gotten better, but I think that it is because we moved to sections that actually needed mowing instead of sections with only a little growth. My trimming skills have also greatly improved.  Shawn and I seem to be in an arguing phase. I don't know how we got here, but I hope we leave it soon. I strongly dislike it when we argue.

      Yesterday was an interesting day. I got off work early to go to my therapy appointment with Nan. We talked about my meds mostly and how they affected me and my moods. Then we got on the topic of Shawn's Grandparents, not a good topic. I know Shawn's whole family dislikes me, but since I am with Shawn they keep quiet about it mostly, but not all the time.  Like his Grandma invited Shawn, just Shawn, to his Uncle's birthday party. Shawn didn't go because 1) He didn't want too and 2) They didn't invite me. I could have cared less if he went, but Shawn isn't going to cut me out of his life because someone else wants him too.  His Grandma even called me "that man" on the phone when she invited Shawn. So now I am "that man". How rude! Shawn says it is quite possible she couldn't remember my name, but if thats the case she could have done a whole lot better than "that man" Grrrrr....Anger  Well, Nuff Said...

      Yesterday was okay. It was mostly spent mentally preparing myself for the coming work week. We sat around and watched the tele mostly considering that it was Shawn's only off day and one of my only off days.  We went over to G Street and saw Zak, Shawn's sister's kid. He is getting so big and spoiled. When he grows up he will have some hard realities to contend with. He is sort of learning he can't have his way in everything, but it is going slow because of his age.  Well, Nuff Said...

      Well yesterday was better than my birthday. Shawn and I made up and are ok now I think.   Work was okay as well. I am now on the "Yard Waste" detail so work is that much easier. I am getting better at mowing and trimming, certainly much better than Scott, who by the way did get fired :O(  Speaking of work, on one of those days last week, my boss, Jack, went to the hospital for bowel blockage. He is not expected back to work for a while. I called on the Goddess and God for help saving my job...I wonder if Their responsible for what happened to him?  Well, Nuff Said...

      Today was an okay day.  Today was the last therapy session with Susan. She has reached the end of her internship and is going to take a job in Bettendorf (one of the Quad Cities). We made some progress in today's session. I hope that since Shawn was there he will understand me a little more now. I will miss her :O( I hope the new therapist is as great as she was.  We stopped over at G St. to visit and play with Zak. He is getting so big and smart. He makes me want to have a kid of my own someday. I don't know if Shawn wants kids, but I do.  Tonight is our Tuesday night group. We are meeting at Fred's, a friend of ours, house. I hope we have a lot of fun tonight Lord/Lady knows we need it.

      Today was an alright day, not good or bad just alright.  I was late for my therapy appointment so I ended up backing up Nan's appointments for the day (oops! :O)) I did get to see her anyway and even got some more meds. There is talk about possibly changing or increasing my meds due to the fact that I am not getting enough sleep or even sound sleep. In order to change/increase my meds we will have to talk to the doctor.  I even found out that the company that is supplying my meds needs a rejection letter from DHS (for the medical card) in order to keep supplying me with meds samples. Shawn and I stopped by the DHS office and got the neccassary form.  Hopefully tomorrow my Food Stamps will come in and I can eat. I have been craving Pop Tarts all day :O) I don't know why though :O)  There was allegedly an earthquake today. I cannot really confirm or deny it since I felt nothing. Although a trusted source as well as the news said there was.  I called the paper today to see if they had any paper routes available. They said they did'nt, but would keep me in mind when they did.  Still no job :O(  Other than that, nothing happened of note today.

      Today was a disappointing day :O(  We woke up to late to go to church today. I hope next time we will remember to set the clock in order to wake up on time. I know I have said it before, but I'll say it again, I really miss going to church. I wish there was a UU church/fellowship in Monmouth.  I really miss going to the LGBT parade today. All I did was lay about the house and feel deppressed. Next year will be better though because I plan on helping Shawn get a new car so that we don't have to depend on his mother's van to get out of town when we want to go.  We did stop over at G St. today. I found out that Jen has started playing "Animal Crossings" again. I asked if it would be okay if I came over and played my game every once in a while and she said I could :O)  On Monday I will be calling the newspaper back to see if they have any paper routes available in town. Shawn's mom has a bike in the backyard that she is willing to give us. I once was a paper boy and have no problem with doing it again :O)

      Today was a great day.  We managed to get the van for a while and went to Galesburg to see the new Harry Potter movie. I LOVED it, especially the scene with the choir. Maybe I can get the song they sang on the movie's soundtrack or even download it from the Internet! I plan on buying all the books and movies when I get another job! :O)  Hopefully tomorrow we will be going to church. It's not the same as going to the LGBT parade in Chicago, but at least it's not sitting around the house all day doing nothing.  I don't know if I mentioned that I will be getting Food Stamps in the middle of next week, but it is good to know that I won't be starving for much longer :O)  Nuff Said...

      Today was a frustrating day.  We went over to Public Aid to re-apply for Food Stamps. This time with only me on the case. It seems Shawn makes to much money to be eligible for any assisstance. I think this is bogus because they don't really take into account all the various factors involved in living in today's society. On the bright side I was approved for assisstance so that means Shawn will be able to use his tip money and paychecks (hopefully) to get himself food. I do know this I will not stand by and let him starve.  I was able to mail off the "Annual Report" form and money order for the church though. I hope everything is in order and I won't have to worry about it again until they send out the next round of reports.  So we did'nt get the van this weekend which means no family, friends or parade, but we have made tentative plans to go see the newest Harry Potter movie. Assuming we can get the van to go to Galesburg.  I know I will miss not being able to see my family and friends, but I think the parade is what I'll miss most :O(

      Today was another disappointing day.  We went over to G St. to negotiate for the van only to find out that Jen and Ben's truck needed repair and unless they could get it fixed by this weekend we were going to miss our trip to Chicago. Shawn and I are both disappointed by this and I am frustrated with living here.  Don't get me wrong, I love Shawn with all my heart, but if I had known then what I know now I am not so sure I would have moved here. What would really tick me off is, that now that we have spent the trip money, if his mother gives us the van anyway.  On a happier note it seems that if we have enough money by this weekend we will be going to see the new Harry Potter movie. I think that this would be a fair trade for missing our trip.  We also did a hell of a lot of laundry today too.

      Today was a disaapointing day.  I finally heard back from Public Aid. They denied us Food Stamps because they say we make to much money. So now I have to go in Friday before 10 am and re-apply with just myself on the application instead of Shawn and I. I don't like this set up because it means that I will not be able to provide food for Shawn. Perhaps since he will no longer have to provide food for me he will be able to eat with his tip money :O(  We went over to G St. to see Shawn's family and negotiate a deal for us to use the van this weekend. His sister and her family are back from Florida and look nice and tan. They said the trip was fun. Shawn's mom was sleeping so we will have to go over tomorrow and see what we can work out.  Still no word on a job yet. I called some places, but they are still reviewing the applications which I am beginning to think is code for "we're not hiring" :O(  Other than that nothing much happened today. My life is so boring :O(

      Today was an okay day.  I found out that there is a snag in our plans to go visit my family, friends, and the parade over this coming weekend. We now have to negotiate with Shawn's family for the use of the van. I have a strange sinking feeling that this is a ploy to screw me out of my visit to Chicago. I wish she, his mom, had mentioned this "problem" when we asked for the van in the first place.  Our Food Stamps are still not in yet. I am getting a bit frustrated with this waiting game, but as I have said before will wait till Friday then call Public Aid again.  I still have no job. I put in applications all over town and not one person or job has responded with a call. I am already frustrated about that, but will keep looking till I find one.   Other than that not much happened today.

      What a day today was :O(  Shawn got paid today and it turns out that we will have to do some "creative accounting" if we want to make it to see my family, friends, and the parade in Chicago. I hope that we will be able to make it without to much trouble.  We went over to G St. so that we could try and call my family to let them know we were coming and might possibly need some money, but all the doors were locked from the inside and no one answered when we knocked :O(  Still no word on the Food Stamps. As I have said before if they are not in by Friday I will call and see what's going on. I hope it isn't to much longer because we are needing Shawn's money for other things like bills and such.  Our friend Amy (sp?) stopped over to see if we could tape wrestling for her tonight. I told her that our VCR doesn't go to the channel it will be on. She suggested bringing over hers, but I know Shawn and I would be upset if someone tampered with the way we have our stuff set-up now.  Other than that nothing much really happened today. As I have stated before I lead a boring life :O(

      Yesterday wasn't a very interesting day. We did a bit of laundry and watched the tele. We did meet a family member of Shawn's mom's boyfriend though which was cool.  Today is being spent lounging around the apartment since Shawn isn't feeling well. He woke up with a very bad migraine this morning. So we did'nt go to church today.  Speaking of church I am starting to really miss it. We have'nt been in so long it's not funny. I know this is odd coming from someone who seems so anti-Christian, but I can't help it.  We did order in from Pizza Hutt today. I really like their food, but they are expensive as hell. The whole order cost us around $22. I wish the other pizza joints in town would do a better job because then they would give Pizza Hutt some competition.  Still no word on a job or our Food Stamps. Maybe this coming week we will hear something. If I have'nt heard anything on the Food Stamps by next Friday I will call them back and try to put a rush on things. As far as the job all I can do is keep looking.

      Today was a very relaxed day.  I went out to job hunt and ended up putting an application in at the City Hall again. I am hoping that they will hire me for something other than mowing. I know I have a very slim chance of ever being hired by the City again, but it was worth a try.  Still no Food Stamps. I have a feeling that they are going to wait until the last moment to process our application. At least when we are approved this time we will get a bit more in stamps than we did the last time.  The guy that Tom, our landlord, has as a handy man around the building is a Peeping Tom! He was doing something in the storage area by our apartment when he decided to peek into our apartment through the blinds on the door. I almost stepped out to ask if he needed anything, but he was already getting into his truck to leave. He did spare our door some parting glances before he left, but it was majorly creepy :O(  Shawn had to go to Peoria today. A piece of machinery at his job broke and he had to go to Peoria to either get a replacement part or a brand new machine. This means that he will not have to close tonight as he is basically working the whole day through without his normal break. I am glad he isn't closing because he needs all the rest he can get :O)  The tires for both the car and the van came in. Now we just have to remind Shawn's mom that we need the van for the Chicago trip and eeverything will be a okay :O)  We still have Van Gogh, my cat, he has litter now and has stopped using the floor around the litter box as his personal bathroom. I am still thinking of getting rid of him for a kitten, but I may just keep him.

      Today was another boring day.  I have decided to put off volunteering anywhere in the hope that I will be able to find work. I feel that if I volunteered anywhere right now it would be conducive to my laziness problem. Another reason I have put it off is because I am in to watching Star Trek:DS9 when it comes on in the morning. I usually catch DS9 then go out job hunting.  Still no word on Food Stamps. I hope they come in soon because we are out of food and have resorted to using Shawn's tip money to get food. If I had known it would take this long to get them I would have prepared better for the long haul.  Still no word on a job either. I hope it does'nt take as long as it did last time for me to find work. I have a feeling that that would place alot of strain on me and Shawn's relationship. I am not prepared to spend another year without work.  Today is the day to go on the Florida trip. As I have said before Shawn and I are not going. I guess this is a good thing as I have discovered I really don't like planes. Shawn, although he is afraid of heights, has no problem with planes. I guess I would be okay on one as long as I did'nt have a window seat.  Speaking of planes I have decided that my fear of planes probably came from the 9/11 attacks. I watched as each plane collided with the World Trade towers in fear. I know if I never rode in a plane again that the terrorist will have won, but that does'nt stop the little knot of terror in my gut.

      Today was almost a bad day.  Shawn and I argued last night and this morning over what I wrote in my Blog yesterday. I totally understand his position, but I think he can't see things my way sometimes. I am just happy that the whole thing was settled. I strongly dislike it when we fight :O(  The trip to Florida is coming up soon. Shawn and I will not be going. I know we would have enjoyed it if we did. I would like to plan a trip with Shawn. I think we would have a great time, but money and work keep us rooted firmly in Monmouth.  Speaking of work, since I am in between jobs right now I have decided to volunteer at the local hospital. I have to fill out an application and go through a process, but I am confident that I will be chosen.  I also got a job application from the hospital as well. I am hoping that through volunteering I will be able to land a job. I am not sure what I could do there, but I will find something to do :O)  Food Stamps still have'nt come in yet. I am worried about them now and hope that they come in soon. I forgot to write when we went to the Public Aid office on the calender so that I could track the days that way.  Shawn is worried that we may have to give back the new computer. He says that there is no way we can pay for it and pay for the Internet with just one person working. I asked him if I should start transfering everything back to the old computer, but he has'nt said anything about it lately.

      Today was not so good a day.  First off, the van and the car both have new tires on them. This is good because now we can go to Chicago and see my family and the parade too :O)  Shawn and I both went to therapy with Susan today. My homework for her is to communicate with Shawn better and to get out of the house with Shawn and do something. I think she is trying to get us to go on a date.  Speaking of Shawn, he has been getting on my nerves tonight. First, I said I did'nt like the idea of leaving the living room light on when we left at night because you can see into the apartment. He responded by saying that I was just being paranoid. This p*ssed me off because it was like a slap in the face. Like from now on anything I say is going to be marked up to my bi polar and simply dismissed.  Second, we, the three directors, of the Sacred Way Fellowship had to fill out a annual report form. I gave it to Shawn to sign on the line marked "Secretary" and he filled it out in the wrong spot. If you don't know where to sign something...Why not ask? How hard is it to simply ask?  Well thats enough of my ranting and raving tonight.

      Today was another so-so day.  I had to go to therapy with Nan, my nurse, today. We discussed different issues and solutions to those issues. My meds have now increased to 15 mg a day. I hope the increase in my medication will control the disorder I have.  Not much has happened today. I lead a pretty boring life now. I miss my old life so much that I think about it constantly, but I do not miss it enough to want to return to it. I am happy with the person that I have become.  My smoking seems to be under control, but not enough to reduce myself back to a pack a week. I think I will probably have to try a patch or something :O(  I am definately getting rid of Van Gogh. Since we are out of litter he has taken to sh*tting on the floor by his litterbox. This is unacceptable behavior. Sabrina, Shawn's sister-in-law, has a litter of kittens and she is going to give us one.

      Today was an okay day.  We had to take some laundry back over to G St. so that it could fully dry. I suspect that once I start working again we are going to invest in our own washer and dryer or at the very least set aside some money for a trip to the laundry mat every week.  We had a little accident in the van today. We accidently bumped a truck that was parked funky in the back yard today. The kid was quite irate and even threatened to physically hurt us (LoL!). There was no damage to either vehicle. In my opinion he should'nt have been parked there in the first place.  I think Shawn's sex drive is picking back up. I know I need to give him more oppertunities to explore sex and stuff, but I am sometimes either not in the mood or doing something when his urges strike. I will have to attempt to be more in tune with him when he is in the mood.  I saw the first episode of the "L Word" yesterday. I think of it as a lesbian's QAF, but then again I did'nt get into it that much. Of course, I know I'll watch it whenever it's on unless it's a re-run :O)  The van tires still have not come in yet. I sincerely hope they do soon.

      Today was an interesting day.  First off I woke Shawn up too early this morning because I got my days mixed up and thought it was Sunday :O( He has been sick all day today. I hope he gets better soon.  We went over to G St. today to do laundry. We got to hang out with Ben and Zak while we waited on our clothes. Zak's vocabulary is getting so big! He can now say and understand the words "Yes" and "No" :O)  While we were over at G St. we learned from Shawn's mom that James, our car, will possibly be getting a fixed tire sometime in this coming week. This is a good thing as the old tire was going flat and seemed flatter everytime we stopped by.  I have to admit I went out and bought another pack of cigarettes today. I still have a few left over in the old pack so I am still keeping to my one pack a week rule :O) I plan on gradually cutting down on my smoking until I can quit all together :O)  The mailman put our mail in the wrong box again! I have already called the Post Office about this so I don't know what else to do. Each mailbox is clearly marked all the letter carrier has to do is lift the lids up to see what letters go in what box! Shawn was right when he said my calling the Post Office would'nt work :O(

      Today was another so-so day.  Still no word on the Food Stamps. I hope it won't be much longer because we are literally eating only once or twice per day until they come in.  Still no word on a job. I have applied at all the places in town that I can. I have a feeling that the only way I am going to find work is to leave Monmouth. I know our car won't make it to Galesburg, but I really need to get there in order to be able to work. I may have to leave this area all together in order to find work :O(  I am working on my smoking habit. I am trying to take my smoking back down to a pack a week like it was before I started smoking so much. I hope to be able to quit all together. I know it won't be easy, but it is costing us too much to support my habit. I just hope I won't turn into a gluttinous pig, well more then I already am :O), when I finally do quit.  Everything is going well on the pen pal front. I have many people writing me now :O) All of them are good people. I love the fact that they are all LGBT! I don't have the usual worries of revealing that I am gay to them.

      Today was a slow and tedious day.  I basically lounged around the apartment all day. I really need to find something to occupy me while I am between jobs. I thought about volunteering, but I don't think anywhere around town has a need for any volunteers.  I did watch the MTV Movie Awards. This years show wasn't as good as last year's or previous years shows, but I guess that just goes toward the caliber of movies that were released this year. There are several movies I know I'll definately see so I guess the show wasn't a total waste.  Shawn and I have been doing okay. We have not argued for a few days now. I make it a point to read his Blog so that I can know how he really feels without having to ask him. I know I should have enough courage to just ask, but I am not good with the expressing of emotions. He did get me cigarettes and food today so I am happy.  I need to start doing this Blog earlier than the times I have been doing it. When Shawn gets home from work he likes to go on- line and around that time is usually when I like to do an entry so that it encompasses a full day.

      Today was a so so day.  My food stamps still have'nt gotten here and I am starting to get worried. When I called to find out about the delay my caseworker said that they had 30 days to get to my case and that they just had'nt gotten to me yet. This angers me because what if we had no food? We are down to very little in the kitchen.  Speaking of food, I asked Shawn to take me to G St. so that we could raid their kitchen and he refused. I know why he did, but it does'nt change the fact that we are running low on food.  I also learned today that Van Gogh will dig through any source of trash. I caught him digging through the bathroom garbage can. I think he was looking for food. This is one of the reasons I want to trade him in for a kitten.  I just read Shawn's Blog and found out something I already suspected. He is frustrated that I lost both the jobs I have had since I have been down here. I don't know what to say except that next time I will have to do better so that I can prove that I can hold a job. Shawn is also frustrated that I don't give him enough "ME" time. So that is another thing I will have to work on :O(  I am out of cigarettes too :O( I really need to stop or at least cut back on smoking. I have an obstruction/asthma in my lungs anyway. I will have to try and take better care of myself :O(  So to sum up the day, I am out of food, cigarettes and my boyfriend is frustrated with me. I will not be a happy boy tomorrow :O(

      Today was a fun day or should I say night?  I got my meds today. It turns out that even though she did'nt return my call, Nan went ahead and left me a bag of meds at the Monmouth Bridgeway.  Shawn had a Saftey meeting at work today. He says that the guy filling in for the regular District Manager wants to make changes, but he is from a low volume store so he did'nt expect the amount of buisness that the Monmouth store got. They had to go behind him and fix his mistakes.  Tonight we went to our Tuesday Night group. It was a lot of fun because we met at Steve J's house. He has a wonderful place that is very well decorated both inside and out. We even figured out a way to make remembering where the group meets every Tuesday easier. (KNIGHTS COZY in NIKKO'S CHERRY) in other words:  Knights of Clombus Cozy Inn Nikko's Cherry St  As soon as we got home we found Van Gogh cowering underneath the kitchen table because somehow a slug had gotten into the house and was right by his food dish. He is scared of a lot of things that cat :O)

      Today was a slow day.  This morning I forgot to turn on my turtle, Speedy's, heat lamp so now I have to leave it on longer to make up for the missed time.  I tried to get in to see Nan today so that I could get a refill on my meds, but alas it was in vain. She was booked with clients and never returned my call. So I will have Shawn take me to the Galesburg Bridgeway tommorow so that I can get my meds there hopefully.  I recieved a few letters in my Inbox from my pen pals. I love recieving the letters, but hate writing them back because I feel that I am a bad letter writer. I don't really know if I articulate good enough to be understood. I guess only time and practice will tell :O)  I have a low level migraine trying to form so this is all for today. My apologies to those of you who feel cheated after yesterday's long entry.

      Today was an interesting day.  First off we missed church. I know this is because Shawn had to close Saturday night, but that does'nt stop me from missing church in the I really wanted to go way. I find it odd that someone who is so anti-Christian as I would miss going to a place where the denomination had roots in the Jewish and Christian faiths.  We stopped over at G St. today also. I pressured Shawn into asking his mom if we could borrow the van to go to the Gay Pride Parade in Chicago. I know it was wrong and I am deeply sorry for it, but I miss my family and friends so much that sometimes it hurts. I never counted on missing them so much when I moved here. I don't mind living so far away as long as I can see them at least every once in a while.  Shawn and I got into an argument today over me pressuring him into asking his mom for the van and I guess alot of other things that had been troubling him. I don't know what to say to him. I am not good and emotional things yet I follow my heart and mind in every situation. I guess I am very bad at being a boyfriend. How can I express and articulate feelings and thoughts into words when it is so hard for me to feel and understand them myself?  So to rap up the van issue, we have to wait for new tires to arrive for the van. I hope they come before the 25th which is the day before the day we are supposed to leave.  For some reason I am feeling very emotional right now. It could be because I just watched a very emotional and thought provoking episode of QAF. I don't know.  I am still thinking of getting rid of Van Gogh, my cat, in favor of one of a friend's kittens. Van Gogh was an alley cat that I brought into our home to feel a need for an animal. Although he is starting to grow on me I feel that he still retains too much of his alley cat nature to make a sufficient house cat. Shawn is definately against multiple cats or probably even mutiple animals in the apartment.  We also stopped over at Tom's, the landlord's, house. He is against having a cook out for the building. I suppose it is because he thinks that the residents in the building dislike him or that he dislikes the residents. He did say that Shawn, myself and Chetta, a neighbor from upstairs, are really the only people in the building that he really talks too. So I guess my idea is all washed out :O(

      Today was a slow day.  We are starting to make preperations to go to Chicago to see my family, friends and the Gay Pride Parade. I hope to make arrangements to meet people at the parade as well.  Shawn gets paid tommorow so I hope to get the bills paid off so that when we go to Chicago we have some money in our pockets. Last year we were broke and could'nt afford anything, but the train tickets and a few trinkets.   I also hope to see the new Harry Potter movie in the theatre this time. I will have to beg Shawn to take me. When I get another job I want to purchase all the HP books again.  We have to purchase some nails to fix the dresser drawer. We stopped over at G St. today to pick up a hammer and nails, but Mom and Roger were sleep and Ben, Zak and Jen were gone. I will probably asked Ben next time I see him if we can borrow his tools for a while.  Still no word on the job situation. We stopped into American Eagle, a restaraunt down here because they had a sign out, but they had already hired all the people they were going too.

      Today was a quiet day.  I called Public Aid to find out why my case is still "pending" and found out that they have 30 days in which to process my case. My caseworker just has'nt gotten around to me yet. This makes me think that if I was starving, which I'm not, but if I was what would they do? I thought the application said that we might be eligible for Food Stamps within a few days if we filled out a certain section? Guess I was wrong :O(  We have two drawers that need to be fix here at the apartment. One in the kitchen, which is off track, and another from our bedroom dresser. The one in the kitchen I will have Tom, our landlord, look at. The one in our bedroom I will fix when I get a hammer and some nails.  I saw the cuteist guy today. He lives next door to us in the house with all the kids :O) I think our upstairs neighbor, Shawn's co-worker, Ericha likes him, but I don't know any of the details. I would'nt mind being friends with him. I also found out that he is the one who has been riding the motorcycle through the back yard. If Tom finds out he will get a stern talking to I bet.  I want to see the new Harry Potter movie, but Shawn says we don't/won't have enough money to see it. I hope he is wrong because I would really like to see the movie.  I got myself signed up for a pen pal service called "Pride Pals". It caters to LGBT people seeking to get pen pals. So far I have gotten so many letters from so many cool people. Well, there was this one lady who had a problem with Pagans, but I decided not to write her back. She was interested in using snail mail to communicate, but I will not give out my physical address to anyone over the Internet.

      Today was another slow day.   I tried calling around to jobs only to either get no answer or the standard run around. I am getting tired of this hassle. I don't understand why it is so hard to find work here. Wait, scratch that...yes I do know why it is so hard. It is so hard because I now live in a small town where it seems there are a lot of people out of work so I am competing with who knows how many people for the same minimum wage jobs.  I need to call Public Aid and talk to my caseworker. My Food Stamp case is still pending after all this time. I don't think it should take this long unless there is something wrong with my case. I hope everything is fine because we are nearly out of food :O(  Shawn tried to update his Blog today and got an error messege. All the stuff he wrote got erased from the computer. I hope the same thing does'nt happen to me or else we will be looking for a new blogging service.  The kids have decided that the hallways of the apartment building are good for playing in. All day today they have been having a good old time in the halls. If I wasn't worried about bugging Tom I would snitch on them. They need to realize that when you live in an apartment building that is not the proper way to behave.

      Today was a day of rest and relaxation.   I watched a movie called "Euro Trip" which was very funny. It was about a guy going to Europe (Berlin exactally) to hook up with a girl he sent a horrible e-mail to under the mistaken belief she was actually a male internet predator. I really enjoyed this movie and would recomend it to everyone :O)  Still no word from the job end of things. I am frustrated at this, but I will keep looking and I know that if I can get one job I can get another.  Other than that I slept the day away.

      Today was an interesting day. We had all kinds of fun :O)  Well, for starters I got movies :O) I know this might not interest you the reader, but I have made movie watching a sort of hobby. I enjoy watching films and I will only watch them once or I will watch them again if it has been a long time since I have seen a film. I generally only watch a movie once though.  Shawn and I had sex finally. It was just what both of us needed...Well at least I hope he wanted it too. After reading his Blog I learned that he will have sex with me even if he does'nt really want too because he thinks that I want/need it. Hmmm, will have to ask him about it later.  We went to our Tuesday night dinner group tonight. It was at the Knights of Colombus in Galesburg. I had too many margaritas and felt a little tipsy and nausiated the whole night. I also ate a lot tonight too.  I realized to late that I had forgot to take my pill before leaving the house for the dinner group. I need to make sure that I remember to take it at 6 pm with no exceptions. The pills and therapy are all that stand between me and the darkness.   I forgot to add this in to the other post so I will add it here. I saw the funniest thing a few days ago. I saw a beat up jeep pulling a broke down truck down the road. The jeep's back bumper was so rusted and mangled that as it rounded the corner, with the the truck in tow, the whole bumper came off the jeep and the truck was left stranded in the middle of the road.   I don't know maybe you had to be there to find it amusing, but living in a small town where nothing much happens and nothing much changes it was a welcome release to laugh at the vehicle owners calamity :O)

      Today was a long, boring day.  I think the reason the day felt so long and boring was because Shawn works from early morning till late evening. I have probably said this before, but I strongly dislike being alone for long periods of time. I guess it's something I picked up from being in jail for 3 weeks and a night. The reason I went to jail was because of false charges brought against me by my a**hole ex-boyfriend.  I can't wait till the 14th because thats when Food Stamps come again. I am getting tired of eating creamed corn :O(  I will have to buy a variety of foods next time so that I won't be stuck with just one thing to eat when I have to wait on Food Stamps again. Of Course, I will have to curb my eating habits so that I don't eat so much :O)  My smoking is under control. I am cutting myself down to 3 cigarettes a day. I feel that after a while on this regimen I can then totally cut cigarettes out of my life. I need to quit smoking, but I have such an addictive personality :O(  My teeth are starting to act up again. I plan on maybe stopping in to see a dentist on Monday. I think it is just a cavity. I hope that thats all it is :O( I should mention this to Shawn, but I probably won't because then he will make me go see a dentist.  Well, thats all for today...

      Today was a slow day.  I did what I usually do during the day. Although, starting Monday that is going to change. I will start my stint of volunteering then. So my days will be a little different from now on. I hope to volunteer all during the week, but Shawn seems to think it will only be on Mondays.  I will be going to Bridgeway on Monday as well. I need to get a med re-fill. Shawn says we are going to have to start paying them soon. I totally agree I would hate to have my services terminated for non-payment.  Speaking of Shawn, we did talk a little today about our feelings and stuff. I think we are getting over this rut we have found ourselves in. I totally hope so because I love Shawn and I want our relationship to last.  On Tuesday I will be calling Ayerco to check on my application since Amiee got fired for some reason or another. I hope to get this job because I want to prove Shawn wrong by showing him that I can keep a job. Plus, I will be needing the money because we have bills to pay and I need new clothes, shoes and acessories :O)  Well, thats all for today...

      Today was a rather boring day.  I spent the morning lounging around, watching the tele&nbsp;and eating. I know, I know I need a life desperately, but I don't really know how to go about getting one. I do enjoy watching DS9 at 12 pm so it will have to fit around that :O)  Shawn and I are at a weird place in our relationship. I don't quite know how to describe it. It is like he does'nt really want to spend time with me anymore. I don't know if this is because I am not working right now or if it is something else. I hope we resolve it soon before any permanent damage is done.  I am going to start volunteering at Starting Point, which is like the local shelter here, on Monday afternoons, early evenings. I'll be filling in as a receptionist for them. Starting Point is a Christian facility so I am wondering how I will fit in there. I am not a Christian and have no wish to be. I just hope they don't see me as an oppertunity to evangelize :O(  We have'nt been going out to the Tuesday night group because of lack of funds and transportation. I hope we can start going again because I think the both of us really enjoyed the group. I don't know why I brought that up, but it just popped into my head.  Well, thats all for today...

      Today was an okay day.  There were police, an ambulance, and a&nbsp;fire truck at the building today. Apparently Caitlin, a friend and neighbor, and her boyfriend Matt, also a neighbor and friend,&nbsp;broke up. The police were here escorting Caitlin. The fire truck and ambulance were for Matt. Matt has an anxiety disorder which went off when Caitlin dumped him. I personally think they are being immature about the whole thing, but it is just my opinion.  Shawn has laid down an ultimatum. I have a week to find a job or I have to volunteer at the clinic/hospital. I wanted a volunteer position that would allow me to still watch DS9 when it came on Spike TV, but Shawn was firm in pointing out that he did'nt care. I wish I had moved Shawn up to near Chicago rather then moving down here. I would have a job already if we had done that.  I have a Maquis Zone 4 staff &nbsp;meeting tonight. I am sure everything will go okay. I wonder if they solved the issue of how to record the meeting or if we are supposed to take notes again?  Hopefully tonight Shawn and I will be able to watch "Hell Boy". I am looking forward to spending time with him tonight. We don't get much time together anymore, but I understand it is because he is working so much. I don't know what we will do when I start working :O(  I have to name the guinea pigs. So far I have drawn blanks as to what to name them, but I am sure I'll think of something.  Well thats all for today...

      Today was a bit boring.   I went to my local video store and rented "Hell Boy", but I can't watch it unitl after Shawn is finished with the tele. He is planning on watching the re-run of the&nbsp;pilot episode of "Stargate Atlantis" I like the show ("Stargate Atlantis") and think that it will be on for a long time.   I have a slight headache that has pretty much lasted all day. I took some Excedrin (sp?), but it has not kicked in yet. I think I will take more pain killers in a little while to try and get rid of this headache. I hate it when I get headaches because they seem to be tenacious bastards that don't want to go away.   I stopped by Bridgeway today to pick up a re-fill on the meds prescribed to help me sleep. So far they have worked great, but unfortunately if I get woken up during the night I am awake for the rest of the night. I may need a higher dosage, but I don't want to risk the side effects.   Today and last night the guinea pigs were mating like crazy. I don't yet know what we are going to do with the babies (if they have babies), but I am sure we'll figure something out :O) Perhaps we can sell them or even give them away free. We still have to name them still. I have been considering some names, but as of right now nothing is definate.  Well, thats all for today...   &nbsp;

      Today was an interesting day.  I found out that the two apartments on the&nbsp;third floor of the building are being vacated. This means that there will be two new vacancies in the building. I hope whoever moves into those apartments will be good people and even better neighbors.   The building really needs some work done to it, but Tom, the landlord, really does'nt have the time to do it all. I think next time he is in town I will volunteer to help him keep the building clean and stuff. It really needs it badly, but after a little clean-up it will be okay.  The tenents from one of the&nbsp;third floor&nbsp;apartments abandoned two guinea pigs in their apartment so I went to claim them. I know I have pets already, but I could'nt just leave them there in the apartment alone. Who would feed and water them?  I have lots of cigarettes now so I am happy. I just have to carefully ration them so that they will last for a while. I am still considering quitting smoking. It's a filthy habit and a hard one to break.  Shawn is starting to get frustrated by the fact that I don't have a job and it seems I can't hold a job for more then a few weeks. I am so used to being near Chicago that I did'nt really realize how hard it is to get and keep a job somewhere else. I guess the next time I get a job I will have to take measures to make sure I keep it.  Well thats all for today...

      Today was a&nbsp;okay day.   We went over to G St. to do some laundry. While we were over there Shawn's paternal grandparents showed up. It's not that I don't like them or anything, but I did'nt want to stay there when they were there. His paternal grandparents blamed us without proof when a bill for internet &nbsp;porn showed up at his grandparent's home. After that fiasco I am wary of them.   Which reminds me that we still have to pay off that porn bill before they come looking for their money. Especially before another notice is sent to the paternal grandparent's house.  Right now I am chatting with one of my pen pals on Yahoo! Messenger. I&nbsp;will be&nbsp;adding all my pen pals to my Messenger so that I can chat with them as well as e-mail them. I used to have a lot more pen pals, but some of them stopped writing so I stopped writing them.   We did'nt get to go to church this morning, but I am hoping that now that Jen and Ben's truck is fixed we can borrow the van next Sunday and go.&nbsp; I am sure they miss us at the fellowship.   Well, thats all for today...

      Today was a long, boring day.  I lounged around, ate, and watched the tele. I would have gone out to see friends, but decided to be too lazy and just stayed home. I have been doing a lot of that lately. I just have'nt felt like doing much of anything. I need to correct that quickly before it becomes a habit that I cannot break.  Shawn is working from open to close today. I miss him when he is gone, but I know we need the money that Pizza Hutt provides. It is also good that we spend time apart because I don't want the relationship to sour because we are always together.  I am out of cigarettes. I really need to quit smoking, but it is so very hard to do so. I have the problem of quitting smoking makes me eat and I gain weight. I know many people have that problem, but I would prefer not to gain anymore weight. I am already chubby in the tummy. I will have to ask Shawn for cigarette money tommorow.  I recieved a credit card offer in the mail today. I know I will just tear it up and throw it away. Can you imagine me with my own credit card? I would be so far in debt it's not funny :O) I mean I want to get a credit card, but I really don't trust myself to have one and just use it for emergencies.  Well, thats all for today...  &nbsp;

      Today was a slow, boring day.   I kept thinking about my old stuff. The stuff my a**hole ex-boyfriend stole/destroyed/whatever from me. I keep thinking that my personal stuff is out there in the world somewhere and I can never get it back. This has haunted me long enough and I am ready to move on with my life. I just wish I knew how to move on :O(   Shawn works all day tommorow. By all day I mean from open of the restaraunt to the closing of the resteraunt. I know he will be very tired and he won't want to do anything on Sunday.&nbsp; I wonder how I will get the clothes washed? I'm sure I'll think of something :O)   Still looking for a job. I have not had any luck around town :O( I am thinking that my best bet is to find a way to get to the surrounding towns and try my luck there. This will be hard as I have no way of getting to the other towns.   My smoking is spiraling out of control again. I need to go on the patch or something. I think I am smoking more because I am so stressed from not working and not being able to help Shawn with the bills :O(   The neighbors and their children are back. Is it just me or was that the quickest f*cking vacation in the world? The only way I knew they were back is when I heard their little hellions playing in the building again :O(  Well, enough about my deppressing day...   &nbsp;

      Today was an alright day.  I recieved the call I was waiting for from the clinic/hospital. It seems that my labs came back fine with only a slight iron deficiency to worry about. The doctor was going to prescribe iron pills, but since we can't afford the prescription I turned him down. I will just remind myself to start taking vitamins when we can afford them. The doctor also wants me to keep taking the med samples he gave me. Ever since I started the new meds I have not had to throw up. I call the doctor again when I run out of the new meds.  The next door neighbors and their kids are gone on vacation. This is good because it means that the building will be much quieter until they return. Shawn and I both think that the reason why the neighbor kids are such hellions is because although the parents yell at the kids they don't back up the yelling with anything. I just hope they are planning on taking a long vacation so that we who live in the building can enjoy the peace :O)  Other than that nothing much happened today. I guess thats what you get when you live in a small town like Monmouth. I wonder how I will react when we finally do move closer to Chicago? I wonder if I will miss Monmouth? Probably not the town itself, but the people I have met I know I will miss.  &nbsp;

      Today was another okay day.  I was able to relax today in a way I have not been able to in a long time. I did the usual stuff like watching the tele and eating, but I was able to do it in a more restful way than before. What worries me is that I may become complacent in the fact that I am not working right now.   I need to find a way to get to other towns in this area so that I can find work. I don't know if that is going to be possible, but I must find a way. I cannot get Unemployment pay&nbsp;because I have to work at a job for 4 weeks and have&nbsp;the paperwork&nbsp;signed, sealed and delivered to the Unemployment Office. I think this is a stupid policy to have when you live in a town where jobs are few and far between.  I hope my lab results come back clean from the clinic/hospital. I am worried that they may find something wrong with me :O( I know thats why I went to the clinic/hospital in the first place, but it does'nt stop me from worrying.  Apparently Jen and Ben had their truck taken into the shop to get fixed. I am hoping that it does get fixed and soon because I miss my family and friends.&nbsp;If they did have it taken into the shop then it&nbsp;will just be&nbsp;a question of money, &nbsp;Shawn having a weekend off and his mother's willingness to allow us to use her van.  I read Shawn's Blog and it seems he is getting as restless as I am with the way life is for us. I think change would do both of us some good. I can't wait to find another job so that we can move closer to Chicago.

      Today was an interesting day. &nbsp; I ended up throwing up like 7 times over the course of the day. As soon as Shawn got home from work and finished eating I had him take me to the local clinic/hospital. I ended up being told that my blood pressure was a little high and that I may have a condition that is like reaccuring &nbsp;heartburn only without the acid. The doctor ordered labs, which meant blood test, but he gave me some meds that should clear things right up. &nbsp; While I was at the clinic/hospital Shawn had to go into to work for a Safety Committee meeting. I thought I would have to walk home, but he showed back up just in time. I am glad I did'nt have to walk because the weather has turned hot and humid here. &nbsp; Shannon stopped by last night looking for her sister. I am not sure if she found her or not, but I hope she got a hold of her. I may stop up at their apartment to make sure here in a little while. Shannon and her sister have a complicated love-hate relationship as far as I can see. &nbsp; Aimee called wanting to know if I could babysit her kids from 12 to 4 today. I said "no" because I had to go to the clinic/hospital. I also said "no" because I don't know if I could have handled Taylor's, her daughter, behavior. I understand that the girl has problems, but I will not tolerate the bad behavior.  &nbsp; Well, thats all for today...

      Today was a long day.  &nbsp;  Shawn started his Shift Manager's training today. As I expected he is now in the bedroom sound asleep. He is working a long week this week. I hope he does'nt breakdown or something. I also hope that he gets a substantial&nbsp;pay raise too :O)  &nbsp;  We got a visit from Shannon sister Katie today. She was bored in her apartment so she came to pay us a visit. The visit was short seeing as how I had to go mail off a tax form for the Sacred Way Fellowship. Speaking of Shannon. I did'nt have to help her move after all. In turns out she and her sister had a disagreement and Shannon ended up moving to her parent's house. Shannon needs to quit smoking now that she is pregnant again. Apparently she does'nt care with this child so she won't quit :O(  &nbsp;  I had a therapy appointment today with Dr. Sachdiva. She gave me some pills to help me sleep. It turns out I have to break the pills up into 1/3rds in order to take them. I was a little scared of one of the rare side effects. Apparently you can suffer a painful,&nbsp;extended erection! I hope that does'nt happen to me!  &nbsp; I ended up not calling&nbsp; to make an appointment for a check up today. I did almost throw up again today though so I just might make an appointment after all. &nbsp; I did'nt get to talk to Neil today. I hope he is fine and his life is going better than it did in his old place. I guess he will pop on when he is ready too. &nbsp;  Well thats all for today...

      Today was a rather relaxed day. &nbsp; We stopped over at G St. twice today. The first time was to pick up the vaccum cleaner. The second time was to drop off the vaccum cleaner and to pick up a pair of gloves so that I could clean the toliet either today or tommorow.&nbsp; We have the apartment some what cleaned up. At least it looks like it has been spruced up a bit. &nbsp; Tommorow I have an appointment with Dr. Sachdiva. I am going to ask for either a change of medication or the addition of a medication that will allow me to fall asleep and stay asleep at night. When I was on Lithium I slept soundly even when they had to raise the dosage to get the same effects, but I don't want to go back on Lithium because it screwed up my memory. &nbsp; I have to call and make an appointment to see a doctor tommorow as well to get a check-up. I want to get to the bottom of this regurtitation buisiness.&nbsp; I will have to talk to Shawn before I do that though to make sure I have a ride to an back from the clinic. I am not going to make an appointment that I can't get to and from. &nbsp; Tommorow I also have to help our friend Shannon move into one of the upstairs apartments. I hope it does'nt take long because I do have an appointment to keep tommorow. I am sure everything will go smoothly as long as her husband does'nt start any trouble. I may not like fighting, but I will if I have too. &nbsp; Right now Shawn is sleeping like a baby in the bedroom. His face is so passive and peaceful. I wonder if he knows how much I love him. I think out of all my relationships this one will last a long, long time. &nbsp; I hope to talk to Neil, my British friend, tommorow. Thats if he has started his new job yet. I like&nbsp;chatting&nbsp;with him. I hope to call him when I get more money on my calling cards.

      Today was definately a boring day. &nbsp; There was nothing on the tele to watch really and I did'nt eat much. I still have'nt gotten around to cleaning up the house. This will probably happen tommorow or Monday. There really isn't much to do, but it should take an entire day or two to really thouroughly clean up. &nbsp; I threw up again today. I don't know why I have these sudden fits of regurtitation, but it is starting to get annoying. Shawn wants me to call and make an appointment with a doctor. I personally don't want to because it would cost a lot. It's not like I'm throwing up blood or anything yet. It only happens after I eat/drink usually so I am going to assume that I am eating/drinking too much and leave it at that. &nbsp; Shawn's&nbsp;Grandma Bale&nbsp;called today. He is right she is a little chatterbox! I don't mind it I guess :O) I'm thinking she just wants to get to know me. Shawn still has'nt told them (The Bale Grandparents) that we are together, but I am sure he will when the time is right.&nbsp; &nbsp; Speaking of family, I miss mine. I can't wait till Jen and Ben's truck is fixed so that Shawn and I can take a trip to Chicago. I miss my friends too so I will be able to visit them as well. This is assuming that Shawn's work schedule allows for it.

      Today was&nbsp;one of those&nbsp;days.  &nbsp;  I went to go to the library today and ran into Quinton,&nbsp;a guy I used to work with when I worked at the cemetary,&nbsp;&nbsp;he told me that a guy there at the cemetary did the exact same thing I got fired for and he was able to keep his job!  &nbsp;  I was p.o'd and went to City Hall to complain about it. I was told that one of my old bossess would get back to me about it. During the time I spent waiting I tried calling&nbsp;Quinton at work only to be told he was still mowing. So I said I would call back during his break.&nbsp; Apparently after I hung up the guy who answered called City Hall to tattle on me!  &nbsp;  Soon after that I recieved the call&nbsp;from City Hall&nbsp;only to get b*itched out and told that if I continued to push the issue that the City's attorney would be after me. So I did'nt call&nbsp;Quinton back. I hope&nbsp;Quinton&nbsp;doesen't get fired because I went to complain :O( I feel very frustrated right now. Shawn says that I should call the ACLU about it because he feels like it is a case of racism. Frankly I just want to get another job and save up to move away from this town.&nbsp; &nbsp; Shawn starts his SM's (Shift Manager's) training next week. From what he told me he is going to be one busy boy! I hope all goes well for him and that I get a job soon to help him out with the household expenses. &nbsp;  Other then that nothing much happened today...

      Today was a slow day. &nbsp; I need to get some cleaning done around the apartment. All I did today was lounge about and watch the tele. You know the usual stuff. I hope over the coming weekend to get my chores list done so that the apartment doesn't look so unkempt. It's a lot of work, but I am sure I will like the results :O) &nbsp; I did go for a walk later on in the evening and went to visit people, but no one was home! I wish I could do that. You know just up and disappear, but I need to get to know more people in this area if I am going to do that. I am doing my best to make friends, but I still don't know that many people :O( &nbsp; Speaking of friends I did chat with two of my best&nbsp;on-line friends today. Neil&nbsp; from England popped on for a little bit and Bogdan from Romania was on as well. I used to talk to Neil like everyday, but he has since moved back to his hometown and isn't on as much. Bogdan is on every chance he can get, but that is not a lot :O( Neil said he was going to be starting his new job soon. The new job will be the same as his last one (tech support) so he should be on more often :O) &nbsp; Shawn is dead tired from working today. He is currently in the bedroom asleep. I have a feeling that with this promotion will come plenty more days where he will be in the same state.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to find a job soon so that I can take up some of the slack around here. I am thinking of having Shawn take me to get a application from Farmland (a hog proccessing plant here in town). I know I said I would never work there because I am a vegitarian and definately against killing animals for food, but we could really use the money. &nbsp; Well, thats all for today...

      Today was a good day :O)  Shawn got the shift manager's position at work! Hopefully this means more money for us in the long run. I am really proud of him and hope he does well. He has a manager's meeting tommorow, but he thinks it will be more of a b*tch out session than a meeting.  Speaking of jobs, I am still not working :O( I have applied and looked every where in town with no luck. I am starting to get worried, but I will keep searching till I find one!  We went shopping today because my Food Stamps came in. I feel really guilty about having food when Shawn does not. I hope he makes better tip money so that he can afford to feed himself. I tried getting Shawn added to my FS case, but they said with him on it that we made to much money to qualify so I had to take him off my case. We did have a joint case once before, but then I got a job and the powers that be cancelled our case.  I can't stop thinking about Will and all the stuff he stole/possibly gave away. It irritates me to no end, but yet I can't stop thinking about it. I think this is because a lot of that stuff had sentimental value to me as well as real value.  I did get sick again today. I threw up on the living room floor as well as my pants leg. So I had to go and change clothes all over again. I am getting tired of these mysterious fits of regurtitation. It caused us to have to go to G St. and wash clothes all over again :O(

      Today was a hot day. The weather was in the 90's I'm sure! I got a slight headache from the heat, but it seems to have gone away.  We went over to G St. and did all our laundry. I got to play a wrestling game against Brian, Ben's best friend. I am pretty sure he let me win :O)I want to get some new games for our Playstation 1. When I get another job I will try to get a more up to date game system.  My Food Stamps are supposed to be in after midnight tonight. I plan on going shopping tommorow. Shawn says I should only get the basics then get the exotic stuff only after I get the basics. This is so that the food will last me longer then what it has been.  I have to get a hold of a dentist soon. My teeth are driving me crazy. They don't hurt now, but I know that they could start again at any time. Maybe I will call and make an appointment tommorow. The last time I spoke to a dentist about my teeth they said it would be $90 to have a check-up :O(  I am still having thoughts about my old stuff. You know the stuff that my a**hole ex-boyfriend stole from me. I can't help thinking about it :O( I wish I could get it off my mind and move on with my life.  Nuff Said...

      Today started off as a bad day and grew worse as the day went on.  We recieved a call from a newspaper in Moline doing a promotional thing for non-customers. I, being half asleep at the time, fell for it and registered for this promotion. Shawn was not happy, but I am sure we can cancel at least I hope we can :O(  I went to therapy today with Nan. We talked about how I was doing and possibly changing or adding a new pill to my meds. I am having trouble sleeping. I am not getting a deep relaxing sleep.  Tommorow we are going to G St. to wash clothes. We should have done it Sunday, but we slept through most of Sunday :O( Since Shawn only works during the day tommorow we can wash clothes then.  I did call Public Aid about my Food Stamps. My caseworker said they should come in on the 14th. This is good seeing as how we are out of food already :O(  Now I have the worst mild headache. I have already taken 4 painkillers for it, but it is not going away. The painkillers just lessened it.  Nuff Said...

      Today was a sleepy day here in Monmouth.  It started to rain during the afternoon and Shawn and I both took rather long naps. I woke up just in time to catch "Harry Potter & The Sorcerer's Stone" on the tele. Shawn slept for much longer catching the second showing of the movie.  I still have'nt called Public Aid to find out when my Food Stamps will regularly come in. I am so forgetful at times. I will have to call tommorow.  My teeth are starting to act up again so tommorow I will be calling a dentist to see about getting them fixed. I am a wussy when it comes to pain so I am dreading calling.  Our friend Brandon is going into the Marines in a month or two. He has to go because he got caught trying to shoplift a bottle of vodka from one of the local stores. He says he was thinking about going any way, but the whole shoplifting thing cemented it for him. I will miss him and try to get the address to where he is going so that we can write to each other.  Well I guess thats it then...

      Today was a boring day. For the most part I did the usual (watch the tele and ate)I know, I know I need a life :O)  I did go over to G St. with the hopes of playing "Animal Crossings" and picking up some garbage bags. No one was there so I just picked up the garbage bags and left. I probably could have played the game with no problems, but I don't want to be there without anyone else being there because if something comes up missing or broken I don't want anyone blaming it on me.  I have to talk to the Nan, my Bridgeway nurse, and Dr. Sachdiva, my Bridgeway Doctor, about changing my meds. I seem to have built up a tolerance to Zyprexa. Also yesterday and today I threw it back up. Yesterday I did'nt re-take the pills, but today I did. I seem fine right now, but I will be wary just in case I did'nt throw up the meds and I took to much by re-taking it tonight.  I stopped over at our friend Aimee's house today. When I got there her daughter Taylor was crying because she wanted her Daddy. She stopped crying when I showed up, but soon started crying again because she wanted her shoes out of the car. Aimee says her daughter's got ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder. She is on meds for it, but the meds don't seem to be working correctly. I could not have a child like that because I know my own temper. That child would have a red a** before too long!

      Today was a regular day.  I did the usual today (watched the tele and ate) I have to find something to do with my time that is more constructive, but fits around my tele schedule :O) Perhaps I will volunteer someplace, but not at this time.  I took my meds today with tea and immediately threw up everything in my tummy. I don't know if it was the meds that caused the regurtitation or the tea, but I am not going to re-take my meds till I'm supposed to just in case they did'nt come back up with everything else. Gross! I know :O)  Shawn says that the brake light in the car came on so we will probably have to have that looked at soon. If it is not one thing it is another with this car. A new car was one of the things I was looking forward too with the cemetary job :O(  My teeth have stopped hurting so I don't think I will have to see the dentist, but if they start acting up again I will go see the dentist about it.  The weather was rainy today and I got soaked walking to and back from the gas station. When I got home I looked like a drowned rat :O)

      Today could have been better, but it was not a bad day.  I spent the day loafing about the apartment watching the tele and eating. I seem to be doing a lot of that lately. I have to get myself up and out of the house. I really need to find some better more constructive use of my time. Of course I have already marked the calender with tele shows I want to watch so I will have to work around those times :O)  Speaking of my lazy streak, I still have no job. I have pretty much applied at every place in town so now I have to start hunkering down for the long haul of joblessness. Illinois Skills Match, a service of the Unemployment Office, has matched me to many jobs, but unfortunately they are all out of town.  My smoking is starting to get under control. I am happy with the fact that I can go longer and longer without a cigarette. Yay me! :O)  Shawn and I have not had a fight or a disagreement in a long while. I am thinking that this relationship will last a long time. Especially since people in his family seem to stay to gether for a long time :O)  We are running out of food again. I am going to call Public Aid and find out when my Food Stamps will regularly come in. I know I've said that before, but it is always good to remind yourself of these things. I will also ask them if there are any Food Pantrys around town.

      Yesterday was another slow day. I ate and watched the tele. Today was spent languishing around the apartment as well.  I tried to call Tony, a friend, only to find out that his number had been changed. I did find out that Don, another friend, is into RPG too, but he is currently on a trip and won't be back for a while. I really want to get a RPG going.  Still no job. I have a feeling that I will not find another one in Monmouth. This is a problem because we cannot get to any other town. Our car just woke make it :O(  My smoking is sort of under control, but I am still smoking way too much. I wish I had never started smoking in the first place. Especially now that I have breathing problems (COPD) caused by smoking and growing up with smokers. I started smoking because my mom smoked. I know this is not an escuse, but it is the truth.   Shawn got a call from Pizza Hutt this morning. Apparently they needed him to close tonight because a co-worker's ex-husband caught up with her and beat her up quite severly. I feel bad for her and hope she gets better soon.  Money has gotten really tight and we may have to return our newest computer to the rent-to-own place where we got it from :O( I hope we won't have to, but who knows we just might have too.  I may have to schedule a dentist appointment to get my teeth taken care of. For the past week or so the teeth in the back on the left have been giving me problems. I know two of them are cracked and may have to be removed. I also know that the hole where my ex-boyfriend removed a tooth for me still has shards of the tooth in there and they may have to be removed as well :O(  I have to call Public Aid again and find out when to expect my regular Food Stamps to start coming in. I got about $100 to hold me over till then, but I would really like to know when Food Stamps will start regularly coming in.

      Today was a boring day.  I spent the day watching the tele and eating as usual. I really need to get some friends and a life :O( I tried to visit my friend Dawn, but she wasn't home. I don't even know if she still lives in the same apartment.  Shawn gets paid tommorow so we will have to go out and pay bills. I am not looking forward to this as it will take up his check. I feel really bad about not working while he goes off and works so hard for crappy wages and even crappier bosses.  I did enjoy the fireworks yesterday even if they were kind of lame. I guess thats one of the prices you pay for living in a small town :O) I did forget to bring a blanket which meant we had to sit on the grass.   I did a little shopping today as well. I used a little of my Food Stamps to buy stuff to suplement my dinner tonight. I ended up getting sick and tossing my cookies in the bathroom :O(  My smoking is somewhat under control, but I am still thinking of going on a patch, a pill or something.  Well thats all for today...

      Today is an exciting day.  We got to do laundry today. We needed to get that done early because of the fireworks display tonight :O)  We also got to hang out with Jen, Ben, and Zak today. Zak was being a pain in the a**, but he had his good moments. We all watched "Penn & Teller's Bullsh*t" it was quite funny :O)  I also got a new pack of cigarettes today which is always good :O)My smoking definately is out of control I think I will have to try the patch or something :O(  I got to talk to Bogdan, a good friend of mine, on the Internet today. He is this totally hot Romanian guy I met last year while surfing the Web. I really enjoy talking to him and wish he could fufill his dream of coming to the USA.

      Today was a lonely day.  Shawn worked all day so I got to be all alone in the apartment today. I understand he has to work, but I wish he had more normal hours. I really miss him when he's gone :O(  I did nothing today, but watch the tele and eat. I really need to make some friends here so that I won't be lonely as much. I mean I have friends here, but they are not as close to me as my friends are in Joliet. I shall have to try to make some close friends here.  Tommorow is the 4th of July which means that we shall be going to the lake here in town to watch the fireworks. I love fireworks shows, but the one here could be better.  Tommorow is Sunday, but due to the holiday there will be no church services at the UU Fellowship. This is good because it means we will not miss church :O)  Money has been very tight lately. I expect it will become tighter as time goes on especially since all three of our apartment bills (Power/Gas, Telephone, and Cable) have come in.  Speaking of money I am yet again almost out of cigarettes. I really need to get a handle on my smoking.

      Today was a bit boring.  I did nothing, but eat, stop over at two libraries, and watch the tele. I lead a pretty boring life now, but as compared to my old life I guess I should be really grateful I don't have the same problems that plauged me in the past.  I tried watching a British movie called "Get Real" that I had previously seen, but after getting about half way through it I decided not to watch it. I admit that while it was nice to get a shot of one of the cute lead actors naked it was not enough to warrent me watching the whole film again.  Speaking of cute British guys, I have not seen hide nor hair of Neil for a while. I know he said his last day of work was approaching and that he was going to be moving back to Nottingham, but I thought he had Internet access there. Oh Well! I guess I will see him when I see him.  That reminds me that I have not been doing much chatting with anyone lately. I miss all my chat friends, but I am sure they are just busy with their own lives and will pop up soon :O)  My smoking habit is not under control. I find that I am going through smokes quickly. This will not please Shawn as he is the one who is purchasing my cigarettes :O(

      Yesterday was an okay day. I finally got my stamps and did some grocery shopping. I even mailed off that application for the medical card to Public Aid. After that I ate and watched the tele till I fell asleep.  Today was quite boring. I had to wait till Shawn got off of work in order to get cigarettes. Which meant I spent the day craving nicotine. I despretly need to get my smoking habit in check.  Still no job. I am starting to get desperate and even called the places I worked at down here to see if they would take me back. So far no one has jumped at the offer :O(  I have been thinking a lot about my stuff that my ex-boyfriend destroyed or gave away. I hope that soon I will be able to get over it and move on with my life. I have a feeling it will be bothering me for a long time.

      Today was a relaxed, but quick day.  I volunteered at Starting Point again today. The phone still seldom rang, but I was smart today and brought something to read. Now that I know the trick is to bring a book I will have to make sure I always bring reading material.  Matt, a friend from an upstairs apartment, wanted me to come up and get drunk with him. Naturally I declined because I don't want to get drunk today. I hope I did'nt hurt his feelings, but that was my decision.  I am still working on the whole smoking issue. I have manage to cut down to three a day. This is good because I can soon cut smoking out of my life. Perhaps by the end of the year I can totally quit. I really need to quit because of my health issues.  Well, thats all for today...

      Today was a calm and relaxed day.  We did'nt get to go to church today. Apparently one of the vans broke down so we were'nt able to use it. I really miss going to church. I hope we will be able to go again soon. It would be great if someone had a UU church or fellowship here in Monmouth.  Shawn is spending today sleeping. I know he needs his rest, but I get lonely and bored when he is asleep or gone. I guess I will have to find ways of amusing myself :O) Perhaps Tuesday I will rent a video game in addition to a movie. I doubt I will have enough, but one can hope :O)  I start a full week of volunteering this coming week. I like to be useful, but I also like to be productive. What I mean by this is that while I am useful at Starting Point I am not productive at Starting Point. All I do is sit around and wait for the phone to ring. I know this is an important job because it frees the staff up to do other things, but I wish the phone woould ring more often.  We still have to pay the bills for this month. I guess we will have to wait until tommorow to pay them. I just hope Shawn remembers this fact. I mean I understand today is his only off day, but we still have things to do :O( I just wish I had a job because then things would be easier.  Well, thats all for today...

      Today was a relaxation day.  I took off from volunteering over the weekend. If anyone asks I'll just say I wanted my weekends to myself. I am sure it is no big deal, but I do hope no one gets upset. I will just have to show up everyday next week.  I went over to G St. to see everybody. I ended up taking Zak for a long walk back to the apartment and then back to G St. He thoroughly enjoyed it. I am constantly amazed at his growth rate both mentally and physically. He is a great little kid :O)  Still need to work on my smoking. I know I said it was under control, but I keep making excuses to myself so that I can have more then the three allotted cigarettes per day. I should have more self-control than this, but apparently I don't. I blame it on myself :O(  Shawn had to work all day again today like he did yesterday. Poor, poor Shawn :O( I know he is going to be so tired and worn out when he gets home. I will have to make sure that he has plenty of time for rest and relaxation.  I should spend this weekend working on the Sacred Way Fellowship stuff. I have to get it all figured out before we get anyone in the congregation. I will start tommorow and spend the whole week working on it.  Well, thats it for today...

      Today was a boring day.  I did the usual stuff (eating and watching the tele) I know I said I would get a life, but I think having a life means having a job so until I have a job I will have no life. I hav applied everywhere in town now all thats left to do is play the waiting game.  I went to Starting Point today. I only had to stay until 5 pm because Kurt, a staff member, was there. I usually have to stay from 3 pm to 7:30 pm. I hope they always have staff members present from now on or at least give me some other work to do because it gets really boring just sitting there waiting for the phone to ring.  Speaking of jobs and Starting Point, I am going to ask Amy and Jack, the directors of Starting Point, if they know of any job fairs or other job related programs that could aid me in my search for work. I hope they do because I am starting to get desperate.  Shawn gets paid today, but it is far from a happy occasion as all his check must go to cover this month's bills. I really hope I find work soon or I am fearful that we won't make it. What I mean is I don't want to have to move back in with his family... I am not sure I even could.  Well, thats all for today...

      Today was another relaxed day.  I went over to G St. and picked up some stuff we needed around the apartment. I played with Zak and was quite suprised when he actually said "HI" and "BYE" to me :O) He is growing up so fast. I look forward to the day when Shawn and I can adopt our own children and raise them. I am not sure if Shawn wants kids, but I know in the future that I do.  I am thinking of getting into some form of art. I do not know which art form I want to try yet, but when I do you'll be the first to know. Right now I am into forms of Asian art, but that could change in the future. When I say Asian art what I mean is haiku and calligraphy.  I went to my appointment at Bridgeway today also. All in all it was a great appointment. I was able to talk openly about my feelings and even was able to get my meds. Of course Nan was out of lunch bags so I had to walk home with my meds in a box which was inside of a shopping bag that I got from Pat, the secretary.  Tommorow I go back to volunteering at Starting Point. After two days away from the place I am looking forward to going back. I just hope it is not as boring as before. At least I am not volunteering at the clinic/hospital because then I would have to walk further away from home to get there and back.  Shawn is frustrated with me because I was able to scrape together the change to get a pack of cigarettes. I should have given him the money so that he could put gas in the car. I do not know what to say. I guess I should have given him the money, but I also wanted cigarettes.  Well, thats all for today...

      Today was a good, relaxed day.  I got to relax today. I lounged about, but did not eat. I was able to relax and enjoy the day at a nice leisurely pace. I don't get many days like this as you well know so I thoroughly enjoyed today.  I cannot wait till I get my Food Stamps again on the 14th. I will have to be more careful about how and when I spend them. I still have some food left over from the last time I got them, but I need other things to prepare them. The only thing I can prepare without another, missing ingredient is rice. I love rice and will be eating a lot of it until the 14th.  We went over to G St. to do laundry. We did'nt do a whole lot so I did'nt get bored easily. Plus, there were other people in the house besides us so I got to hang out with them. All in all we had a good time there.  I took two days off from volunteering at Starting Point. I decided I needed today and tommorow off so that I could relax and find my center. Plus I have an appointment at Bridgeway tommorow. I am also taking these days off so that I can attempt to find a job.  Speaking of finding a job. The pressure is on now as we have had several bills come to the apartment at once. Shawn is really feeling drained and frustrated. I am really wishing I had just moved him up to Chicago with me rather then moving down here myself. At least there we would have found jobs relatively quickly.  By the way, as you have probably realized I did'nt get hired at the gas station.  I did some re-decorating to this Blog. I hope you like it because I do. I am not sure why I added a place for comments as I am usually the only one to read this Blog. I am using it as an online diary so I apologize if it reads like one. I use this Blog so that I can keep an on-line record of my life so that I can look back and examine it at my leisure.  Well, thats all for today...

      Today was an okay day.  I got to lounge about the apartment and relax. I am still working on getting myself one of those things called a life, but it is going to take some time. I do miss the standard of living I had when I lived closer to Chicago, but all I need is a job to get back to that standard.  I went and volunteered at Starting Point again. I will, hopefully, be volunteering there for quite some time. This will give me something to do while Shawn is at work. I just wish I had more to do there then just answering the phone. It can get pretty boring there. I do get to eat dinner there though which is cool.  I have to call a local gas station tommorow to check on my application. I hope I get hired, but I dread having to work the Lotto machine. It is so complicated to me :O( If I don't get hired at the gas station then I don't know what I'll do :O(  I still have no names for the guinea pigs. So far we have started calling them "Thing 1" and "Thing 2" :O) Perhaps thats what we will call them. I will give it a few days to mull it over in my head.  Well, thats all for today...

      Today was an interesting day.  I did the usual for most of the morning. Yes, I know I need a life :O)  I am going to get one I promise. I will get one as soon as I find myself a job.  In the afternoon I went and volunteered at Starting Point. It was long and boring :O( I had to answer a phone that seldom rang. I will have to call tommorow and see if they want me to come in again.  My smoking is doing a lot better. I still smoke too much, but I have it some what under control :O) I just hope I don't run out of cigarettes anytime soon :O(  Well, thats all for today... (Don't you feel cheated?)

      Today was another long, boring day.  I actually did'nt do the usual today. I actually ended up doing sort of the opposite of my usual today. Not much tele watching, no food, and not much laying around. Yeah, I know you are probably wondering why I don't do this everyday. So I say to you it is pure and simple laziness. This will change tommorow as I start volunteering at Starting Point.  We went over to G St. to do laundry. Apparently it was a  race day so Ben and Jen had company. We got to hang out and watch a little of the race. Shawn and I are not NASCAR fans by the way, but just about everyone we know is.  Speaking of Ben and Jen, Zak and Ben both got haircuts. They look okay, but I much prefer Zak with his longer hair. Soon I will need to get a haircut as well :O), but I need to get a comb first. My hair is really nappy and tangled :O)  Shawn wanted to have a heart to heart conversation today. As I have said before I am not good with those kinds of conversations. I am afraid my non responsiveness might have permanately damaged our relationship, but what else can I do? I am not a touchy feely person :O(  Well, thats all for today...
