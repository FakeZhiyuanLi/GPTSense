      Not sure what to say about today, its had its ups and downs.  Shrek 2 was an amazing movie.  Did you know Greg R. has a part?!  And they show a pink thong, i have to say that that part was my favorites.  anyways, yeah the storm tonight kinda freaked me out considering i was home alone with my brother.  In that dreamy state right now which prohibits me from doing anything.  thinking about lots of things but one person in particular.  yes nathan.  we had such a good time on friday.  it was so much fun.  great song is playing right now. I could not ask for more by edwin mccain.  I love the words it just explains stuff so well.  Have you ever found that, where when you hear words that are in songs that it explains your emotions so well.  Why can't you just say those or make sure that they get down on paper?  never understood that.  well going to go to bed i am tired its going to be a long week.   luv always, Jen  P.S. I got an early b-day gift.  My mommy bought me and a friend tickets to the ballet next weekend I am sooooo excited.

      Ok so I am sitting in the library, my damn brother screwed up our computer at home. My mom wasn't watching him while he was on the internet and whatever site he was on totally screwed up the computer to the point where is won't even download virus software.  Maybe  I will see if I can go over to Nates to use his internet.  cause i really don't like being here using this one.  ugh.......  i don't know what i am going to do being on the computer is like my life.  well maybe my dad will let me use his laptop once in a while till we get stuff fixed!  well give my cell a call or send an email to me since i can't be on instant messenger.  262-391-0611 or cggggh05@yahoo.com  anyways g2g i should probably get home so my mom isn't completely worried about me  Luv ya always,(except my brother at the moment) Jen

      Hey all i am at my seminar right now.  We are all in the lab writing our paper only most of us aren't doing it and we are checking email.  The past few days have been so much fun. I can't believe that it is already wednesday almost evening too.  Guess what all my bandos?  The madison scouts are here practicing before they leave for the summer.  That means that if Greg were doing it then he would be here too.  They are performing for us tonight after the talent show is over.  Wow we have such an interesting group, and that is too say the least.  anywayas this camp has been so much fun. i have meet so many really funny people.  one girl reminds me of tasha.  like they have the exact same personalites.  its quite funny.  There are some other people too like one girl from bosnia and one from argentina.  its so cool all the different types of people here.  there is one guy that reminds me of mike fank.  his hair is almost the same and he talks really similar.  it just makes me laugh.  nate is doing well i believe although i missed his second call last night.  i can't alk to him tonight cause we have some thing going on till after 10 and then i guess he could still call but oh well.  we didn't get to bed till 1:30 last night so tonight is def. going to be earlier we hope.  well what else to say.  i see that no one else has written any comments please write them cause i will check this the second that i get home.  i am excited for the grad partys this weekend.  they should be really fun.  hehehe.  well i should probably get going to goodbye from whitewater and i will be home on friday although you can call my cell anytime i have it with me (262)-391-0611 and i will try and leave it on so that it just vibrates otherwise just leave a message.   Luv ya all with all my heart, Jen Hope to hear from you all.  Definately give the cell a ring.  Thanks a bunch!

      Omg today was so not fun at all.  i worked 10-6 and at hamville that is a shit long time and on top of that there was nothing to do.  which makes it go even longer.  nathan is gone for the week which sucks cause then i can't talk to him at all.  that makes me sad.  oh well it won't be so bad once i leave for whitewater on sunday. which reminds me i should probably get packing for that one.  more things to do.  thanks to the people who made comments although i wanna know who a few of those people are.  if ya  make a comment can ya please leave your name unless your really to chicken to do so.  nate i will be writing to you too.  i am so excited for whitewater though.  its going to be so much fun.  hehehe and time away from the family is always always nice.  anyways g2g i was just informed that dinner is ready and i am really quite hungry.  have a good weekend everyone if i don't write anything although i probably will get to write something over the time i am at whitewater or maybe tomorrow too.   Luv ya all (specially nate) hehehe, Jen

      Ok so today I was talking with mel and she asked me if i still had true feelings for Pat.  this really hit me hard.  since we broke up no one has asked me that.  well that got me thinking and all depressed and crap.  i guess its a good thing that no one has asked me till now, cause i honestly can't say that i know the answer.  i can say however that i know that i truely did love him when we were going out. i can say that i know we won't go out again.  i can say that i love having him as a friend.  i can say that there will always be that spot in my heart for him that for a while anyways no one will be able to take over... not even you nate.  something about him still sticks in my brain and i am not sure what that feeling is. i will always love pat just now its in a different way.  its friend love. its ex. love  we went out for two years!! that is a shit long time in high school anyways.  it really got me thinking and now i don't know what to do.  cause yes i do love nate he is an awesome guy but pat is always going to be there too.  at least until the right one comes along.  aww mel why did you have to ask me that although i must say that i was thinking about it all afternoon and you just brought it to my concicous attention.  well i g2g please feel free to make comments to this.  luv ya always, Jen
