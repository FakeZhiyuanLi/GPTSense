      staring out depressed about the words I have to plead, so torn apart. Shattered by impression of confessions in defeat, my broken heart. Crying, desperate, fighting questions scared to let go... but the days go by and things get better. I'm weary from the war, I'm losing half my soul...but the days go by and. Past the point of reasons I just want you to believe that it's not your fault... photographs, the close up, what we had come undone. Where did it all go wrong... but the days go by and things get better. You hardened like a stone to face the world alone...but the days go by and things get better. Exhausted of apologies, in search of something comforting...but the days go by and... JCC

      Oh can't you see, you belong to me...  Sometimes it's good to walk through the halways, catch the tune of a classic, and smile as a cute little blonde girl passes on the joy of Sting to your achey breaky heart.  Jasmine will mock my surge of inspiration on her not so cool livejournal, but it's real my friends it is real.  So, I wonder if I exude my discomfort and as a result create the rubber glue effect ( e for noun a for verb).  Seniors are leaving tomorrow...surreal.

      Tuesday the camry will officially be mine.  So I'm refelecting on the past week, and I can't help but wonder whether or not I'm imagining the increase in his subtle hints.  I am so ready for school to be out. Three days, and I haven't even submitted my applications. What am I thinking? I've got to get on the ball, or I'm pretty much guaranteed a job at home with my sister, and I'm just not up to that.  All I really need is to do a little shopping, that always makes life better.

      The observation has been made that I do not sound like someone in Nigeria, and that observation is correct. I am a Nigerian-American. My father came here for an education and stayed for my mother. I been to visit my family in Nigeria, and they've come to visit us. My father has made certain that his culture is a big part of his children's lives, and I'm grateful for that. So that's the abridged version of my Nigerian heritage, but the full out version is much more interesting.
