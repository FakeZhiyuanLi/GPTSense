						     FACING THE WHITE GIANT    WOW!  Ok, I did it; I want that to be the first thing said.  I climbed that miserable treacherous monster and can’t remember having a worse experience in my life.  Cotopaxi is a serious climb for serious climbers.  A very small percentage of those who attempt to reach the summit make it.  Most turn back due to lack of physical ability, altitude sickness or weather.  It’s a glacier capped volcano that reaches 20,000 feet.  Because of the bulge in the equator, it’s actually the furthest point from the center of the earth and the closest point on earth to the sun.  It’s the real deal!  I’m not comparing it to Everest (whose peak is somewhere above 28,000 feet and it’s base camp alone is higher than Cotopaxi’s summit), but to get an idea of what I was basically up against, match one of these terrifying movies where morons try to climb Everest or K2 and face the worst conditions imaginable.  That was basically my experience.  Alright, out with it right now, I am a moron, much worse than the ones in the Everest movies.  Cotopaxi is a big, dangerous mountain.  Just about no one goes without a guide unless they have some serious mountaineering experience and even then, they attempt the summit with other mountaineers.  I don’t know if it’s ever even happened that someone just shows up at base camp alone, with no experience, no knowledge of the trail, not even the know-how to put on their rented crampons.  I take that back, it happened on Saturday, June 26.  I had done a lot of reading on this.  I talked to many people and read reports from people who had climbed Cotopaxi.  It seemed as though the case was this.  It is a very difficult climb, it is recommended, essentially required that you have either an experienced guide or extensive experience, it is, however, not TOO technical, and it is possible to summit it without a guide if you have climbing partners.  Well, I obviously don’t have the experience, and guides cost about $200  Pffff , $200, not a chance.  I did some research and found that I could rent gear for $25, the refuge at base camp costs $17 and a hired a pickup who was heading that way to take some guided idiots paying $200 for a mere $15, ROUND TRIP- before I found him I was going to hitch to the park entrance, hope for a ride to the remote base camp and then assume that someone else up there wouldn’t mind taking me home after I reached the top.  Yeah, I had it all worked out, I was set for $57.  So, I set off.  Because I arrived with this guided group, the other climbers at base figured I was with them.  I told the group that I rode with that I was meeting my professional guide at the top, so not as endure questioning along the lines of “are you crazy, I don’t think you can do that”.  Here’s what I’m figuring: (1) I’m in awesome shape and well-acclimated, I’ve definitely got the physical requirements down; (2) I’ve seen pictures of young, American tourist chicks doing this, how hard could it be; (3) It’s a weekend so there will definitely be other climbers setting off to tackle the summit.  If I have the equipment and the ability, all that I need is the direction, I can simply follow the guided groups up to the summit, sure, they might be a little slow and I won’t be able to challenge any time records as I like to, but I’ll hit summit in time for the sunrise and watch that great golden fireball appear over the curve of the earth.  Emmm…Yeah, I’m all set.  At base camp, my experience was pretty standard: arriving before noon and waiting until about six or seven o’clock before getting some rest for the 12:00 am wake-up call.  Those chumps who paid top-dollar are off in the afternoon learning how to use the equipment and practicing safety techniques, but hell, how hard could it be.  Dinner at 6:00, in bed by 7:00 and no one’s really sure who I am or what my purpose is, just that I’m really friendly and seem to have a lot of questions.  It seems that at times I might overestimate myself, unless I’m just stupid and don’t consider the possibilities.  Anyways, the first snag in my perfect plan arises as the altitude sickness comes on and keeps my up all night on the outside toilet, taking note of the terrible weather that seems to be coming in.  With not one minute of sleep, I gear up and wait outside for the first group to begin their attempt.  It has snowed all night and is now dumping a mixture of snow and freezing rain on us.  The temperatures are below zero in the dark of night and we are all bundled in expedition-like excess.  As I follow the first group of three across the mars-like terrain, they pay me no attention.  It wasn’t until we reached the base of the glacier (about 45 minutes in) where we stopped to put on equipment and they tied up to one another that the guide questions my intentions.  He is in disbelief that I am there alone and warns me against it.  As I ignore his warning, he makes it very clear that not only does he hold no responsibility for me; he doesn’t even want to show me the way.  He hurries off, trying to lose me.  He is successful.  In fact, they all are.  I started behind the first group, figuring I could follow their headlamps the whole way up and be one of the first to summit.  It is a damn good thing, because as I ran into problems, I found myself losing sight of the group ahead, who certainly weren’t waiting for me, thus I would need to wait for the next group to follow up, and once they passed, follow their headlamps.  Seven groups in all I counted at base, I started behind the first, finished behind the last! Each group that hadn’t already turned back passing me, shocked and furious that I was up there alone, in the dark, with no ropes and no guide.  And each of them trying to lose me, and any responsibility they might have to save my life, as quickly as possible.  So, here’s my experience.  I was sick as hell.  I’m not uncomfortable saying this, but I had to go to the bathroom the entire time-all 9 hours I felt like I was going to explode from the inside.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t stop to do so.  If I did, I would lose sight of the headlamps that I was following.  The conditions were absolutely dreadful: wailing winds, frozen ice & snow sticking to me like feathers on tar, unstable ice below making my lack of experience with crampons that much more dangerous and, worst of all, I have no security.  I’m not tied to anyone, so one slip of the crampons sends me into the darkness, down the side of this enormous glacier forever.  I can not go back because I don’t know the way.  I can’t stop and wait until the groups start coming back down because I’ll freeze to death if I don’t keep moving.  So, here I am, on the face of this glacier at 20,000 feet.  Alone, unsecured, inexperienced, sick to death from the altitude (I could barely breathe at some points), and all I can do is push on, trying to follow headlamps.  These same thoughts kept running through my mind: (1) I am absolutely miserable, this is the worst experience of my life; (2) I have never been more afraid or felt closer to death before; (3) One wrong step or losing sight of the headlamps ahead ensures my fate into the oblivion of this glacier; (4) I would give anything to go to the bathroom; (5) God, am I stupid.  And so was my experience, scared for my life like never before (and I have done some pretty adventurous things), miserable and praying for the moment that I will be back at base-camp, safe and sound.  I didn’t even care about finishing the climb, about reaching the summit, seeing the sunrise, the curve of the earth, etc.  There would be no pride in accomplishing this feat, at this point it was merely survival.  So, with no choice, I plugged on, following each passing group.  As my great fortune would have it, my headlamp batteries die, just as I follow two groups to the start of a crevasse-a large crack in the ice down which you could fall and never be recovered.  We stop and I change my batteries.  In the few minutes it took to do so, all six of them had disappeared.  I saw no headlamps coming behind me, but was certain, at least  really  hopeful, there was one more group.  I had to wait it out.  I ended up passing out on the ice for about 20 minutes, until the last group arrived to cross.  Woken, daylight just starting to show its promise, I followed them.  About an hour shy of the summit the first groups started coming down.  I was following the last, so to make it up and down again to where I was now would be at least 90 minutes.  I wanted so badly to just call it quits and follow the first group down, forgetting the summit.  I didn’t.  I plugged on, in the early morning dusk, missing the sunrise and miserably arriving at the summit, carrying at least 15 pounds of ice that had stuck to me making me look like the stay-puff marshmallow man.  The clouds never cleared and I couldn’t see 10 meters ahead of me.  So incredibly unrewarded by my accomplishment and the prize of glorious views at the top I left without taking a single picture (which wasn’t really an option anyways, considering my entire being was one frozen block of ice), and started my way down without waiting for the folks I had followed.  I made it down in record time.  If there’s another rule to summiting a 20,000 foot glacier-capped, active volcano, it is  don’t do it alone and without experience and safety .  If there’s a rule to descending the same peak, it is  do no glacade .  Glacading is sliding down the face of the glacier, uncontrollably, on your butt.  It makes the descent in a fraction of the time and requires no energy, the only problem is you could clearly just slide right off the path into an abyss of ice and die.  Well, I had enough of this damned volcano and figured, what the hell, what’s one more rule.  I made it.  Cold, miserable, unrewarded, depressed, exhausted, angry – actually, I had no energy for any of these feelings, I kind of just made it, back to base camp.  There, I met the others, sipping their tea (most of whom didn’t make the summit, but backed out in the first couple of hours – unfortunately while I was still leading the pack behind the first group, otherwise I would have joined them).  I simply grunted when they commented on how much harder it was than they had thought, or how sick they had gotten, or what a shame it was about the view at the top.  All of them, the few who summated as well as those who barely made it onto the glacier, seemed exhausted, surprised, but overall rewarded that they at least gave it a shot.  No one even mentioned the fact that it cost $200.  HAH, I only spent $57!!!

						   IBARRA, HELADO DE PAILA & IMBABURA  No time for rest, on Tuesday I made my way from Otavalo to Ibarra, nicknamed "The White City" for all of its whitewashed buildings.  A nice town with cobble stone streets and a beautiful central plaza, I spent the day walking around and took part in something that I haven’t done in years, but since it’s an essential experience in any visit to Ibarra, I had to give it a go – I sampled some helado de paila: ice cream from the cauldron.  It is made with nothing but water, fresh fruit and panela – a natural sugar, and God, was it delicious.  I slept in a little town called La Esperanza which had nothing to offer other than a bed to crash in awaiting for my 5 am wake-up call.  Wednesday I summited my third big Volcano, Volcan Imbabura.  The most physically challenging of the three based on its steepness it was a pretty straightforward climb to an elevation of 16,000 feet until you reached 16,000 feet and realized that there were like 8 different peaks.  The top is actually half of the volcano’s crater and it is thus difficult to tell which part of the crater is considered the actual summit.  No climber wants to return from an exhausting 10 hour climb to find out that they never actually made it to the actual summit (which are never flag-posted or indicated up there).  “No mate, you had to go around that peak and the real summit takes you 30 meters higher, that’s the top”.  I certainly wasn’t going to come back and do it again if I missed it this time, so I made my way around the crater, adding over an tour onto my hike – but I’m damn sure I made it to the top-the VERY top.  The views were pretty rewarding and the weather held out nicely.  After this I felt not only ready to tackle my goal of Cotopaxi, but moreover, I felt ready to take a day off.  That’s exactly what I did the following day, rested in a hammock with my book at La Luna, back in Otavalo.

						     INTI RAYMI - THE FESTIVAL OF SUMMER SOLSTICE    The day after the Otavalo market I decided to continue my training at high altitudes. I rented a bike and set off early for a 3 hour climb gaining over a kilometer in elevation and reaching Laguna Cuicocha. I’m not a biker and as in shape as one can be, when you call upon muscles that rarely get used or at least demand they perform in ways that they’re not used to, they let you know. So my legs were pretty spent by the time I reached the lake. Not spent enough though to complete the circuit around the lake (a recommended 4-5 hour hike) in 2 hours 20 minutes. I was pretty stoked about that, so had to brag. It was a pretty lake, and that’s about it, but it kept boosting my confidence in my ability to train at high altitudes for long periods of time and after the hike I was rewarded by taking part in the festival of Inti Raymi, the summer solstice, which takes place on this lake only one day a year. The Indians of the Andes have the most insane traditions in their festivals. First off, they get drunk, I mean piss drunk, I mean drunk with such a dedication to be completely annihilated like I’ve never seen. The tradition drink is  Chicha  which is made by the women chewing corn and spitting it out and then letting it sit for days while the saliva ferments it. To get married, a woman must make chicha for the potential mother-in-law. If the mother likes it (which I understand to mean if she gets absolutely shit-faced off it since no one can actually appreciate the taste of this fermented corn-spit), then she gets married, if not, decapitated (just kidding). Anyhow, in celebrations, they drink this delicate nectar along with everything else flammable, dress up and dance. The indigenous Andeans’ idea of dancing is to a ballroom as chicha is to fine French wine cellar. All dressed up, like cowboys and animals, they line up as if participating in a boy scout parade down main street and basically just stomp around, never covering more than 100 meters in distance, screaming and howling, then they just stop and continue boozing, sooner or later, they pick it up again. As insane and chaotic as it is, they do it with such organized pride. I stuck around for some of the drinking, dancing and a few formal ceremonies, and returning from my hike 3 hours later there were literally bodies lying in the streets. As I started my bike ride home, I encountered what must have been 10% of the festival’s participants out cold, unconscious and dead to the world. Some of them had the courtesy to pass out on the side of the road, in the grass, some looked like they were capable enough to make some comfort by resting against a telephone pole, most of them, however, were just lying there smack-dab in the middle of the road, alone, with no company; no wives to claim them, no friends, not even any dogs licking them. They simple trusted myself and all of the passing pickups full of just slightly less-drunk partiers, to go around them. I concluded: I love Andean parties. Before I took my bike ride home, I took a boat tour of the lake as the sun was setting. A little chilly, the $1 tour included some hot  Canela , almost like a tea made from Cinnamon to which you add sugar and Aguardiente (a potent alcohol made from sugar cane that might possibly taste as bad as chicha) in what ever amounts desired. I stuck with a half a sweet-and-low from my pocket and just a drop of the good staff to take away the late afternoon nip. It was a nice ride and warmed me up for my ride home. I know that it is impossible to go uphill roundtrip, as in how the old-folks like to talk about their snowy morning walks to school, but somehow, I defied the laws of physics. I had taken a scenic short cut up the dirt roads on the way to the lake that morning, but now decided to stick to the highways and paved rode for my ride back to Otavalo. The first half was beautiful, just cruising straight down paved road, through the mountains, with little use of my brakes. Then something happened, I had to go uphill again. I couldn’t believe it and I certainly hadn’t accounted for it in my energy stores which were now depleted after the day’s activities. It started to get dark and I was getting cold and miserable. Somehow, I mustered up enough to plow on, made it back to the farm and slept like a little baby. Alright, it wasn’t that dramatic, but it was good day!   Less Than Spectacular Lakes    I really don’t know, maybe I’ve just seen so much that it takes something to impress me, or maybe the guide books write these reports as if marketing to people who have never left their homes, but I seem to be continually disappointed on this trip when I read about something spectacular, beautiful, amazing, etc and find that it looks just like any other lake, hill, tree, church, etc that I’ve seen before. So, the next morning, I headed out, full of ambition and energy to keep up the physical pace I had set myself on. I had a companion for this journey,  Milky , the monstrous white hound from my hosteria that would certainly keep any rabid dogs at bay. Our destination was Lagunas Mojandas, labeled the most spectacular lakes in Ecuador. It was a nice hike, I have to admit, but I almost didn’t believe that we were there upon arrival. Maybe I missed something, maybe it was because the day was cloudy, but they were just so unimpressive, I stopped to eat a protein bar and headed right back out taking the obligatory picture. For those few minutes, however, I was visited by some local police, who seemed suspicious, lurking around this deserted little spot where I lunched, but turned out harmless enough, except for the fact that Milky, possibly thinking I was heading home in the police car with some new friends, went racing after the truck as it left, leaving me to hike home alone and face whatever aggressors lie in my path on my own. Fortunately, there turned out to be none and fortunately, Milky knew his way home.

						     OTAVALO    After a night in Quito, I spent this past week a little further north, making my hideout at the  Hosteria La Luna , a peaceful farm up in the hills about 4km from the famous town of Otavalo - legendary for Latin America’s most amazing market - we’ll see.  Again, for the whole week, I had a farm to myself, access to a kitchen, a living room with TV/DVD and quite a few recommended hikes and outings.  First though, was to hit the famous Saturday morning market in Otavalo.   The Market   Alright, I may be a little bit of a travel snob - and I’ve seen a fair number of local indigenous markets in third world countries – but this had to be the most pathetic, cheesiest, touristy market in the world.  It was basically a big shopping mall of mass produced crafts, clothes and anything that a gringo might want to lug home, show his neighborhood friends as proof that he had visited South America, and then never use again.  It was huge, alright, but nothing of this spectacular indigenous crafts market that was raved about in all the guide books. I started off in the animal market, where locals come to buy and sell livestock.  It was nothing more than a few dozen cows and their respective cowboys, seemingly competing to look less motivated than their cattle to accomplish anything.  I was rewarded with one or two humorous incidents as a young boy carried a squealing pig and a couple of cowboys forced a full sized heffa into the back of a high bed pickup that was way too small for her – she fought the best she could dear gal.  Next, what I would call Billion Dollar Strip because that’s how much it would have taken to buy the infinite souvenirs being sold by locals at absurd prices.  Herein lays another problem with Ecuador, one that I will be happy to escape,  dollarization .  I guess about three years ago, the Ecuadorian government adopted the US dollar as its official currency, using our very own greenbacks printed in the states but minting their own coins that match the size and value of ours.  Because of this everything is like 3 times more expensive than it once was and everything is offered in full dollars, so if you want to buy something, it automatically costs a minimum of a dollar.  Its murderous, especially for the locals, whose incomes have not risen nearly enough to offset the inflation of prices in dollars – thus 80-90% of the country lives in poverty.  Ecuador is not the only country that has done this.  In my experience alone, I have visited three others (these my be shocking) that use the US dollar as their official currency: El Salvador, Panama and  Cuba  of all countries (Cuba actually uses our papers as well as prints their own of equivalent value, only useful in Cuba of course.  However Cubans earn the peso, not the dollar, which is worth less than 4% of a dollar and is why Cubans can’t afford things like toothpaste, which costs an entire day’s pay.  In these other countries it seems to have worked pretty well, in Ecuador it is nightmarish, especially for Ecuadorians.  Of course it saves me the hassle of having to do math in my head, although it’s a price I’d gladly pay to have prices where they were three years ago, the level of prices I will encounter in following countries like Columbia and Bolivia.  So, as a result of the prices, the fact that I couldn’t even dream of carrying another ounce on top of the 110 pounds I am already lugging and because it was all crap (although I did almost buy a leather cowboy hat), I moved on to the produce and food market.  Much more authentic and containing goods I was much more likely to buy: fruits, veggies and of course every single part of the pig from its fully decapitated and skinned head right down to its testicles, this market was a little more interesting.  I had picked up a market buddy for a few hours, some Swiss dude, and we had fun taking pictures of each other molesting the various anatomical goods set on display like cheap jewelry as the Indians looked on and laughed at us completely disrespecting what might be their dinner.

						     THE TRAINING CONTINUES    Before another princely weekend, I decided to continue with my training for Cotopaxi.  Especially now, after reaching the base camp and touching the ice, I wanted to be at that summit to see the curve of the earth and meet outer space.  I decided to step it up a notch and summit Illinzas Norte.  Illinizas Norte sits at almost 17,000 feet next to Illinizas Sur (an equally high snow-capped volcano and a far more technical climb).  It is only recommended to summit Illinizas Norte with a guide or if you have mountaineering experience because the rock is very instable and involves some scrambling and possibly rock climbing.  It is also recommended to climb it in two days, reaching the base camp on Day 1 and continuing from there to the summit the following morning.  I followed neither recommendation, nor did I utilize the pick-up trucks that most people use to shave a few hours off the climb, ensuring sufficient daylight to summit and return if you do choose to tackle it in one day.  Nope, I decided to arrive the previous night and base myself in  Hacienda San Jose , shacking up with the gracious host Rodrigo.  Hacienda San Jose is a huge working farm and situated at the base of the Illinizas.  It is complete with every farm animal one could hope for.  Upon arrival (after again squaring off with numerous nasty canines en route) I met Rodrigo’s Nephew, German, who told me that no one was on the farm, but I was welcome to stay in Rodrigo’s house, use the kitchen and ride the horses – full run of the place to myself.  What a great evening I had, not an unnatural sound for miles, a beautiful sunset and a great meal.  Later on, the cheery, long-bearded Rodrigo returned and after some conversation with him, I hit the sack, preparing to wake at 3:30 am to get on the path by 4. Oversleeping was not a problem, since I never fell asleep.  Instead, I battled another stomach ailment all night and almost decided to call the climb off, but I really didn’t want to puss out, so I figured I’d go as far as I could and if need be, turn around.  It wasn’t easy, the combination of a sour stomach, the altitude, the lack of sleep, and of course, what is considered a very difficult ascent, both physically and technically.  I still made it up two hours shy of the suggested 8 hour climb.  The first ¾ were extremely exhausting, but it was the last stretch that really pushed my will.  It was no simple ascent, but rather involved open-face rock climbing on which I never felt secure: let it be known, Ecuador has THE WORST geology for rock climbing in the world.  Its rock sucks – always crumbling beneath you where every hold is a gamble.  Sick, unsafe, tired, was it worth it?  So worth it.  I was blessed with the clearest of days (Illinizas are usually covered in clouds by 9 am).  From the summit, I was able to see 6 snow capped volcanoes – all of Ecuador’s biggest: Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, Antisana, Cayambe, some other one???, and of course Illinizas Sur.  Spectacular!  Taking the advice of some other climbers, I decided to descend the quick way, basically hurling myself down the sandy eastern face of the mountain as the rocks of each step I took broke under my feet and chased after me.  Passing some wild coyotes, I finally reached a pasture from which I could regain the trail (just having saved myself about 2 hours for the slight compromise of my safety).  Here I came across what may be the Ecuador’s only danger greater than its dogs, wild bulls.  I had read about wild bulls and that they are pretty prone to charge.  If you sense one is starting to get a little irritated, you’re supposed to stare at it and back away gently.  I’d be lying to say I didn’t proceed with extreme caution, recognizing the fact that I was in the wide open, with no where to climb, hide or run (unless I thought I could outrun a full grown bull).  Once again, I averted a tragic death and exhaustedly made my way back to the Hacienda.  I am beginning to feel more and more confident in my ability to tackle some large peaks, eventually Cotopaxi.

						     MY WEEKEND WITH JAVIER    Ok, who has a better life than me? This past weekend I made a new friend, became part of a family and had some of the best times I can remember. I met Javier through Mom. He is a quite successful exporter of tee-shirts and lives here in Quito. When he heard that I was coming down, He was very excited to meet me and take me out. I’m figuring I might be able to snag a meal out of this and I’ll get to meet one of mom’s business acquaintances, but I never imagined what and awesome time he would end up showing me or that he is the same age as me.   The White Giant and the White Coats    We met at his office on Friday and climbed into his brand new tech’d out pickup with more gadgets than I could describe. He told me we were going to 4WD as far up Cotopaxi as we could. We headed out and had perfect weather. I hadn’t yet clearly seen the famous volcano, so when we got to a viewing point and I saw the snow-cap glowing radiantly white in the morning sun, my camera just wouldn’t stop. I made Javier pull over about every 20 minutes to take a shot from a different angle, as well as to pee, a symptom resulting from the altitude as well as the 4 cups of Nescafe I consume every morning. You would be amazed how quickly you acquire a taste for instant coffee when there’s no Starbucks in town. Latin America is amazing. It is one of the world’s largest exporters of fine coffee, yet you are hard put to find a cup of freshly brewed Joe at all, and certainly it is a rarity to find the good stuff. Instead, the population lives on Nescafe, an American brand of instant coffee. So, countries here export all of their great coffee beans to the US and in return import our instant shite: make sense? Anyways, what a ride! Evidently Javier doesn’t often have time use his great toy, so he was awfully excited to be ripping up the side of the volcano, tossing up dust and shrub in his path. We got to the parking lot and climbed as far as the ice (just over 16,000 feet and the highest you can go without technical gear). The ride down was even more entertaining as now Javier had gravity on his side. Looking back now, I was awfully confident in that he had complete control of this truck, but then again, I am remembering how the first thing that he told me that morning was how he had only been in it four times in his life and he didn’t even know how to work the radio, or where to put the key. Safe and sound for the time being, we had an awesome lunch of Ostrich and delicious coffee made with milk straight from the cow. We headed back to Quito where I got to tour some of his factories before making a visit to the municipal hospital. Evidently milk from a cow is un-pasteurized and can turn your stomach upside down if your’e not used to it (the fact that I had 4 more cups of coffee didn’t help, but it was the real stuff and quite a treat for me). They let me go for the time being and after a good night’s sleep I was ready for another active day with Javier.   The Family    I have been feeling a little lonely down here. I think it’s a result of just getting started in my trip as well as being in Quito for two long with little stimulation. So, when Javier invited me to spend a day with his family, it couldn’t have been more perfect timing. As if Javier were not the most hospitable, generous, awesome friend to have in Quito, his family equally matched these attributes. Immediately, I felt like part of the family and could not have been taken care of better. We went to Javier’s son Martin’s family picnic/BBQ at private park with pools, horses, games, etc, organized through his school. One of the most amazing parts of traveling is seeing how other people live. In the third world, I’ve seen people living off the land like nothing has changed in the past 400 years, growing their own food, living in houses made of mud, Saturday, I got to see how the other 5% of Ecuador’s population lives. Martin goes to a private school which I would guess is a rather exclusive private school. Not used to seeing so many cleanly pressed polo shirts in Ecuador, it was pretty evident that the fathers of Martin’s classmates were the elite successful of Quito. It was amazing to witness how this small portion of Ecuador’s population lives. Quite indulgently, it seemed, as each middle-aged man sported an absolutely picture-perfect, gorgeous young wife, each decked out in designer clothes and fashionable eyewear that would consume two months worth of my traveling budget. Every eight-year-old was swimming in cosies from names like Polo, Lacoste, etc. Wine was flowing, food was plentiful and everyone looked as though they couldn’t be happier. Kids were well behaved and spoke perfectly fluent English. Men drank, women chatted and I observed what is a rarity in Ecuador - more difficult to encounter than good coffee. Looking back, it really wasn’t that big of a deal, nor should it be surprising, but in all of my travels through Latin America, I am used to seeing the general population, the other 90%, the poor class. Today though, I was happy to enjoy what felt like a good-old American field day with the rest of the families. I don’t think I could have felt more like I was out on a family-day with my own family. After a day at the park, we showered up and headed out for some dinner, SUSHI of all things - could this day get any better? YES, after dinner we all went to what seems to be the biggest thing to do in Ecuador on a Saturday night: the movies! Not only do you have to arrive at the huge Cineplex two hours early to ensure a SEAT, it is also essential that you are duded up in your finest attire, cleanly shaven and wearing plenty of cologne – unless you want to stand out that is. It is some big event for a weekend night down here and we had to park blocks away because all of the parking lots were full. All of this commitment was well rewarded by a viewing, IN ENGLISH, of  Harry Potter 3 . What a day!   Biking and Bungee in Banos   As if Javier could not have already showed me a good enough time, we set out early again on Sunday morning, the entire family and I, to head south to Banos, a town that is essentially the gateway to the Amazon Jungle. There we rented motorcycles and cruised through the lush mountains, passing tunnels, waterfalls, and extremely steep cliffs. Do I know how to ride a motorcycle, I kind of do now. It was pretty cake to pick up, although a few spins around the schoolyard may have been a good idea before flying around curvy mountain roads. By the end of the day I was feeling pretty confident, swerving back and forth, leaning into my turns, fearless of deadly fall into the Amazon below, so, when Javier pulled over on a bridge and yelled out to me “Bungee!” I had no hesitations. As we pulled over, a scruffy little guy with hair to his knees rolled out of a hut that I hadn’t even noticed. Looking back, it may have been a good idea to inspect his equipment, inquire into his experience, or at least how this jump was going to work, do I swing, do I bounce, do I fall into the rapid river 150 feet below because you don’t know how to lock a karabiner. Of course what I did was just let him tie me up. It wasn’t until (less than 5 minutes later) he was counting to three as I stood on the ledge that any sense of danger occurred to me. Too late, I had now gathered a crowd of three dozen spectators, Javier was ready with my camera, giving me the thumbs up and the man who held my life had reached three, off I went. Evidently I made it out alright. All of this excitement certainly worked up an appetite, as well as a thirst for wine. We dined incredibly once more before heading home. What a weekend. I couldn’t have been more grateful or appreciative and I’m guessing Javier sensed this as he told me to get ready for another weekend just like it. Again, I ask, who’s got a better life than me?

						     El CORAZON    After almost 10 days in Ecuador, spending most of my time in Quito trying to develop a game plan, I have determined that one of Ecuador’s greatest resources are the infinite hiking and trekking possibilities. Being at such high elevations, there’s actually almost a formula for how you can go about tackling some of the more difficult mountains and volcanoes- Basically it comes down to acclimatization, where you gradually get your body used to being at high elevations by going to higher and higher mountains each time. I was getting a little stir crazy chillin’ in the city, so decided to hit the hills and start getting acclimated. Hiking is unbelievable. It’s challenging, beautiful, rewarding, FREE and you can do it with nothing but some water, snacks and will power. I chose to climb El Corazon as my first mountain in Ecuador because I could do it as a day trip from Quito. Heading out at the crack of dawn I found myself at the base of the mountain enjoying a cup of coffee in the beautiful El Estacion Hosteria (an old train station turned into a hotel). El Corazon, “The Heart”, reaches almost 16,000 feet and is supposed to be a 8-10 hour round trip climb. According to all guide books, it gets its name from the heart shaped ferns that live on it or some nonsense. I, of course, have my own theory. To summit the mountain you switchback across two supple hills, gently rounded and quite reminiscent of a beautiful pair of breasts. Upon reaching the climax (the top of the mountain, that is), you find yourself traversing from behind and come through right in the middle of the two breasts, right where the “Heart” would be. After a week and a half in a city, the smell and sights of the mountains were unbelievable - I remembered why it was that I came to Ecuador. Climbing was no problem and I proudly reached the summit in 3 hours flat (half of what the books declare it should take). I was glad to find that I had no symptoms of altitude sickness; however, I did soon discover one problem that will continue to plague me as I travel through Ecuador. In the hills, most of the Indigenous Ecuadorians work on large farms and are thus away from their homes for most of the day. To protect their humble belongings, they all seem to employ the most vicious, ugliest, dirty, rotten dogs imaginable. I had been warned but had no idea just how big of a problem this was going to be as I made my way to the mountain. Passing farms, these dogs came on ready for the kill. They literally attack and evidently, rabies is quite common. To survive, you have to hope that there is a large rock near by, picking it up and throwing it at them as they approach. This technique works pretty well and they rear-off (sometimes, just the action of bending down to pick up the rock is enough to make them scatter). Nonetheless, it’s a pretty intimidating situation and being one that doesn’t get on with dogs to well to begin with; I have now come to disdain them. My feat of 3 hours was rewarded by a huge Mongolian buffet meal (my new favorite restaurant in the whole world that I have eaten at for 9 days straight-$3, all you can eat hibachi grill including soup or salad and desert!). Following that was my first night sampling some of Quito’s more active clubs and thus negating the physical achievements accomplished earlier in the day through the consumption of rum and tequila. Overall, if just felt great to get out of Quito and now I am so excited about the possibilities that lie ahead of me as I train for my attempt to summit Cotopaxi, an active, glacier-capped Volcano reaching 20,000 feet at its summit (which is the highest point on earth in relation to the sun due to the bulge in the equator).

						     EL MITAD DEL MUNDO    Being in Quito for a week and needing a change of scenery I decided to take this Sunday afternoon to make the obligatory trip to  El Mitad del Mundo , the "Center of the World". I use the word obligatory as if it were a prerequsite to returning home after a trip to Ecuador, well, it kind of is, but it seems almost punishmental after hearing reports from other travelers on how lame it is. Actually, it really seems rather dreadful after talking with someone who thoroughly enjoyed their experience and hearing how exciting it was- the best part of their trip. Me, I kinda fell right in the middle. It must be one of the lamest attractions in South America, but it was fun simply because of that.  El Mitad del Mundo is precisely what its name suggests, its the very center of the world, 0 degrees latitude, where the equator passes through Ecuador. Its interesting when you visit places that hold some kind of record in the world or, by simple geographical coincidence, can offer something that nowhere else in the world can. Mostly these fortunes are pretty meaningless. For example, when I was in Australia, I visited many places whose names were surrounded by the title "the BIGGEST...IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE". You would never imagine how exciting it is to visit the biggest Zoo, or the biggest Renaissance Fair, or the biggest Children's Museum in the Southern Hemisphere, but I did it all, plus some. So, here in Ecuador, you come across countless sights, activities, etc that allow you to visit, witness or do something that is the closest to the center of the world. The monument, museums, village and displays at  El Mitad Del Mundo  are just the quintessence of this.  At the Center of the World is a huge monument and through the middle of the paths to its west and east run a thick yellow line painted in the ground: The Equator. The ironic twist, though rather inconsequential to the experience, is that when they laid out the monument and painted the line and all that business, they missed, by about 150 meters. It wasn’t even discovered until recently when a well-equipped tourist, sporting GPS technology, pointed it out. So all that hype and the monument, the entrance fee, etc, and you’re actually a few hundred feet away from the actual equator. Nevertheless, it doesn’t distract from the experience which includes and is pretty much limited to taking pictures in as many ridiculous poses as you can think of across the thick yellow line separating the two hemispheres. On top of that there are like a half dozen museums, a fake little village selling nothing but fast food and over-priced souvenirs and a plaza, where, luckily on Sundays, they have live performances – a pretty big show too. So, I took part in this Disney-esque experience, happily and cheesily jumping from side to side of the world, or doing pushups or lying across line while French tourists obligingly took my photo for me and then mimicked my inventive ideas, asking me to take theirs. It was a fun Sunday afternoon. The real excitement, however, comes from the little museum that was established by some brilliant land proprietor who decided to purchase land 150 meters away from the monument. See, his land sits on the real equator and thus it is where you can do an array of things that can only be accomplished at 0 degrees latitude. These feats include balancing an egg on the top of a nail and watching water flush in opposite directions only a few feet apart: It really does happen, when on the northern side of the equator, the water clearly flushes as we are used to seeing it – counter clockwise. You then move the bucket just a few feet across to the Southern Hemisphere and sure enough, it flows down the tube clockwise. Now, I know what you’re asking, what about  ON  the equator – STRAIGHT DOWN, no joke. Now doesn’t this sound like an exciting Sunday afternoon? Well, maybe I fall into the same group as all those lame backpackers who told me how awesome El Mitad del Mundo was. Or, maybe I had just been in Quito for too long, but I had a good time and plenty of corny pictures to prove it.

						   It’s been a week now since I arrived on this massive continent and the majority of my time has been spent in Quito, Ecuador. I arrived on June 1 and have since been exploring the city, planning my adventures through Ecuador, adjusting to the altitude and visiting the ¨Center Of The World¨.    Quito, Ecuador  I arrived in Quito without a hitch, emerging victorious in my first bargaining attempt in South America with a $3 cab ride to one of the few hostals that I’ve ever felt uneasy in. A night of noise, dirt, and stories of daily robberies led me to splurge the extra two bucks from the $4/night I was paying there to take up residence at the cozy Posada Del Maple Bed & Breakfast. Rather upscale in hostal terms, it’s been a great place to meet other travelers, relax on the patio for my nice, long three hour breakfasts and a great starting point from which to wander Quito. Quito is the capitol of Ecuador and is located in the Andes at 9350 feet above sea level. Being young and fit has many advantages, and I just learned a new one - I was able to escape the common diagnosis of altitude sickness upon arrival. Most people, taking a couple of days to adjust, experience nausea, headaches and shortness of breath. While I fared pretty well, I must admit that my morning runs leave me sucking wind after about half the exertion I am used to in NY. In a week I certainly was able to notice a few unique characteristics of Quito.  If one thing stands out immediately, it is the traffic.  Almost every large city in the world earns its reputation (from someone) as having the most frantic, chaotic drivers.  Well, in addition to visiting cities like LA, NY, DC, etc, this is country number 32 for me, accounting for numerous cities that claim the title of posing the most dangers to pedestrians. I feel I can say, with full confidence, Quiteños are by far, the most dangerous, reckless drivers, posing catastrophic risks to all who walk the city blocks.  On the other hand, it is noticeable how proud, organized and developed the city itself is.  It has a fairly safe feel to it, and is not unlike any other city where how you handle yourself correlates directly with your chances of being a victim of crime.  Ecuatoreaños seem more tourist friendly and less likely to scam you than other countries that I have visited and overall, Quito is a pretty decent city, by capital city standards, but after a few days I desperately felt the need to get out and explore.    El Mariscal  I spent most of the week exploring Quito. There are basically two distinct areas worth visiting, El Mariscal, where I am staying, and Quito Viejo. El Mariscal could be named El Gringotenango with the amount of travelers, tourists, students staying there and the plethora of western style bars, cafes, restaurants and tour operators that cater to them. Bright lights, fancy signs, English names and few locals (beyond those 16 year old males looking to score a gringa) still can’t distract you from enjoying 2x1 happy hours on $1 mixed drinks. Not the most realistic of Latin American experiences, but nonetheless, a nice base from which to start.   Colonial Quito and the Markets  A full day for me involved hiking it down to Quito Viejo (Colonial Quito) to wander the plazas, churches and markets there - normally one of my favorite experiences in a new Latin American city. To be completely honest, and maybe I am just a spoiled traveling snob, it was incredibly disappointing. Having visited such amazingly beautiful colonial cities as Copan Ruinás, Honduras; Antigua, Guatemala; Granada, Nicaragua; and Casco Viejo, Panama, Quito Viejo offered little colonial charm, authenticity or culture. It certainly had some pretty plazas and a couple of nice churches, but these points of interest were stuck inside a bustling city of commerce, where every other store sold either cheap electronics or deep fried something. Worth a visit and a few pics, but little more than that.   Since I’m in my critical mode of Quito, let me continue with the disappointing markets. Never, in Latin America, have I seen so much organization, proficiency and pride taken in a local market - which detracts from the fun of the chaos, anarchy and overall nonsense associated with local markets in any third world country. In Quito Viejo wanderings, I visited both household and food markets. The former put Busy Bee to shame in their elaborately organized maze of stalls that were not only sectioned but sign-posted, so that if you were looking for shoes, you could easily find the ´shoe department´- nicely tiled, well lit and lined with walls of Nike, Adidas and Sketchers shoes all in their original packages. The food markets were no different - each form of food had its specified area, with vegetables and fruits being separated and even within the prepared foods area- serving typical style lunches- vendors selling ceviche (raw, marinated shellfish) were partitioned from those who sell moté (kind of like a huge corn kernel with various spicy and salty toppings) and I can´t begin to imagine how one Ecuatoreaño would choose among the rows of full-bodied, deep fried pigs´ heads that stick out of the counter tops in what I like to call the ´artery´ of the market. Needless to say, Ecuadorian food is not reason enough for me to hang around this country, but after a week of research, I found quite a few  interests that might keep me here a while.   The Information Superweek  A lot of my week involved learning about Ecuador and planning my adventures here. I joined a club called South American Explorers which offers clubhouses in Quito as well as Lima and Cuzco, Peru, all absurdly stocked with information, tips, travelers´ tales and references on traveling through South America. I came down here with no plan and no idea of what Ecuador had to offer, so although I was itching to get out of the city, a week of becoming acquainted with Ecuador truly paid off in that now I am ready to conquer snow-peaked volcanoes, surf the Pacific Coast, raft through the Amazon River Basin and visit the numerous indigenous communities with the hope of stumbling through some of their markets, fiestas and traditions.   So, my first week in Quito involved some pathetic running, seeing more backpackers in the Mariscal District than at a North Face clearance sale, disappointment over the successfully established commercialization of its colonial quarter and the markets within and realizing that one local experience that I won’t be enjoying is the delicious Ecuadorian cuisine. Overall, I’d say my first week in Quito served its purpose. I realized it’s a huge, bustling city and I realized that I need to get out. Here I come natural splendors of Ecuador.

						     THE PLAN OF ATTACK    Ya´ll always seem to be curious as to how I can do this, how I can afford it, where I live, what I eat, how I get around, and what exactly I do everyday. Here´s a short answer to a lot of complex, uncertain and forever changing questions:   Expenses  How on earth can this kid afford to travel for a year? Probably the most reasonable question asked by those who know me and my work history. The answer is that it´s not really that tough at all. My budgeting is quite precise and my lifestyle is very simple. When I work, I keep exact accounts of my income, expenses, predictions, etc and when I travel I do the same. I account for every red cent which not only helps me to conserve my dinéro, but also to budget ahead, so, for example, after reviewing my expenses, to the dollar, of my seven months in Central America, I was able to figure out how much I thought it might take me to travel for a year in South America after purchasing my initial airfare and insurance. Thus, arriving in Quito on June 1, I accounted for a year´s worth of expenses to include food, lodging, internet, phone, laundry, alcohol, travel and miscellaneous - the total, about $15 per day (approx. $500-month) or $6000 for a year. Can´t depend on that, but it is a rough estimate and I will always ensure that I have enough money to get me home from wherever I am in whatever bind I find myself. A full year of travel - probably not, I´m sure I´ll be ready to come home before then, but at least I figure I can last that long if I am having such a great time. In fact, I can last even longer if I decide to take advantage of working & volunteering opportunities. The real answer is, I worked hard, saved money and live economically, spending around $5 per night on a hostal, cooking most of my own food and taking local transport along with the local population and their livestock, market products or eight children that they somehow manage to squeeze into one out-of-date school bus seat. A little discipline and alot of desire to see this amazing world makes the cost a rather minimal factor.   Eating  As I mentioned, I usually cook for myself. Not only does this help my budget infinitely, but it also allows me to control my nutritional intake, usually eating local fruit &amp; produce, oatmeal, eggs, chicken breast, vegetable proteins and canned tuna - not much unlike what I eat at home, just much fresher and ridiculously cheaper. I try and choose hostals that have kitchen use (many do) and on the occasion that I have to eat out, I choose something within my budget.   Sleeping  Again, hostals, around $5-night, sometimes as low as $2-3; sometimes in a shared room with other travelers (a great way to meet people) other times I´ll have my own room, but still usually in a place that caters to budget travelers like myself in order to meet as many people as I can. Usually rooms are pretty bare, but almost always clean and safe. Generally four cement walls, a shabby mattress, enough linens and hot water in cooler highlands but only cold on the coast and warmer areas. Beyond a kitchen, these hostals usually offer a communal living area with TV, couches, etc, some form of dining/patio area to eat and hang out- they´re really a great way to travel. Otherwise I´ll probably spend about 20% of my time camping (more when I´m at low altitudes, like the coast) which only costs a buck or two. Beyond that, it is amazing how many opportunities come up to stay with people you meet and friends you make along the way. For example, in my last two months of Central America I only paid for lodging about 15 days.   What the HELL do I do  Fair enough, probably the most understandable question. In truth, there´s really no answer. My days are generally full and they could involve any of the following activities: climbing an active volcano; surfing the Pacific; trekking through highland villages; wandering around a new city, examining its museums, churches and local lifestyle; visiting a fiesta or other cultural event; getting lost in a jungle, or just doing nothing at all, reading, cooking, meeting people, and researching what my next adventure might be. Somehow, though, the days go by and the memories pile up.   Why  This, in my opinion, is the most valid question I've been asked. It's the question to which I have the most passionate answers but also one which I don't feel like I could ever answer fully. Why do I choose this lifestyle? Why do I travel? What satisfaction do I get in exchange for the sacrifices I make? Well, it's so much more than seeing things, or tacking another pin into the map. It's not at all about the photos and souvenirs. I live this life for the experience. It is about the challenges and the opportunities. It's about the fulfillment and the wealth of knowledge that I gain through every experience with each day. It's so much more than you might imagine. It is more than the beautiful sights that I get to see- it's about discovering how to appreciate those sights. It's about more than the new and exotic cultures that I get to witness- it's about learning about people and life in general. It's not simply making friends, but understanding new ideas. It's more than the thrills and the adventures and the mishaps- it's discovering how capable I am of overcoming these challenges and obstacles, it's learning what skills and qualities I posses and realizing how great of a person I can be. Traveling gives me the opportunity to discover the world and myself at the same time. To recognize what I am capable of and what I am not. To challenge myself to become a better person, one who appreciates all that life has to offer and just how beautiful this world is and how amazing are its people.   The Plan  So, what is the plan, there really is none. How long will I be, I truly have no idea, I could be home in a couple of days, it may take me a couple of years. What am I going to do, where am I going to go, what will I see...all the same answer, I really don´t know. So, keep checking in on me and you´ll learn shortly after I do, for now, this is what I have been up to so far...

						     THE ISLE OF TRAGIC REVELATIONS    Well, I made it out of Ecuador.  Two days in Quito, basically doing what I always do in Quito, running errands, checking email, etc.  I still get excited about being in airports, and this trip was no exception.  I look forward to being rid of my baggage, buying a cup of coffee and organizing myself - counting my funds, recording my assets and expenses, checking to make sure all’s in order before being the absolute last person to board the plane.  Flights always amuse me.  I’m sure that part of it is that I’ve been on a few dozen myself and I reckon that some level of comfort can only be obtained through experience, although I have to think that part of it is also just logic.  It amazes me, no matter how often I fly, the urgency with which people rush to their seats before a flight.  Some push, some lie about which row they are in, so as to try and sneak on with the first group called. Overall, there seems to be some emergency that makes people feel that they need to be onboard that cramped, little airplane as soon as possible.  The reward for this untimely embarkation is having to spend more time crammed into the little seats that these very same people all rush in a fire-driven frenzy to exit as soon as the plane’s wheels touch pavement.  It’s with the same urgency that people try and disembark the airplane, only at this point the quarters are less spacious leading to pushing, pulling bags down on top of other passenger’s heads, and a general, disorderly rudeness as if there’s some prize awaiting beyond those doors.  What does wait is just another line to get through Immigration and then the inevitable, uncontrollable wait for your luggage.  In all of the flights I have been on, the entire occupancy of the plane has arrived at baggage claim long before the bags start rolling out.  Seeing that we have no control over in what order the bags will arrive on the belt and we are all there to see the very first piece of luggage peek its way through those rubber car wash strips,  WHAT ON EARTH  is the rush to get there.  Clearly the fresh air and ample space isn’t a priority, because these are the very same people who compromised these luxuries in order to be the first ones on the plane.  Once we all, by luck of the draw receive our bags, we then, of course, all rush to be the first through customs, where outside the deservedly paranoid world of US security, you are simply pushed through, without the slightest of eye contact, regardless of the fact that you have admitted to importing copious amounts of narcotics, firearms and currency (the exception to this is Australia where you better not have even the wood of a number two pencil on your possession or you don’t wish to be quarantined).  Nonetheless, this lunacy always gives me a sense of familiarity and entertainment when traveling and so, who am I to question.  I made it from Quito through Bogotá to Caracas without a problem.  After a few hours wait, some black market money exchanging and being ripped off by a  Nescafe  machine, I got on my little jet headed for Isla Margarita, with the promises of sunshine, sand and song.  Isla Margarita offers the same attractions as any other island in the Southern Caribbean.  It has an added benefit, however, of being governed by a third world country, Venezuela.  Even better is the opportunity to take advantage of the black market exchange rate on US dollars – which earns you 50% more on your money if you shop and bargain hard enough.  People come here for honeymoons, cruise ships stop here and it is a duty-free haven, attracting the international shopper looking to save 10% on a Hugo Boss watch.  I was very looking forward to my week here, starting off with the capital city, Porlamar and quickly making my way to the resort beaches such as Playa El Agua.  It was time for some fun, sun and rum.  Successfully bargaining my taxi ride to an almost disgraceful price, I was already feeling like I had a heads up on the place.  Secondly, I was fortunate to come across an outstanding bargain on a room when the owner of the cheapest hotel in the guide book offered me something at an even larger discount ($3/night instead of $4) if I wanted to rent a room in his house/apartment thing, down the block, where locals rented rooms by the month at an average of a dollar a day.  I checked it out and found myself a room in a house that I share with about 20 other people; all lower-class workers earning on about $4 a day for their 12 hour shifts.  It was one of the only two rooms to have its own bath and was quite spacious, despite being basic.  I shared a kitchen that was dismal at best and offered no less than a half-dozen additional tenants (mice and roaches) to my list of house mates.  These things are really beyond my concern anymore and I gladly cook and eat my meals with them at the table so long as they stay off my plate.  Basic and simple are liberal euphemisms, but for a couple of nights, the money I saved here could be applied towards something a little more posh at the beach.  The very first night, it became apparent to me how interested in my life my housemates would become.  Upon mentioning money exchange, I had no less than 10 board members, all brainstorming where I could earn the best rate, all quoting me ridiculously low estimates and all urging me dreadfully against the idea of changing money in the street.  It was very dangerous.  Having done this sort of thing countless times in numerous countries, I wasn’t that concerned, but nevertheless, was given company by one of my new companions who is a casino security guard.  He had a night off and decided to spend it with me, chasing the worst recommendations for money exchange and discovering pitiful rates, I told him I would wait until tomorrow.   The first morning, I went right to the doctor to get my stitches out.  I was a day past the week that my doctor instructed, but had been traveling the entire previous day.  I figured rather than getting it done a day early in Quito, I’d get it done a day late on Isla Margarita.  In the past week, I had cared for my foot perfectly – changing my bandages everyday, taking m antibiotics, not pushing myself and visiting a doctor every other day for a check up.  Four different doctors that week complemented me on the healing and assured me that it was just a superficial cut, there was no infection and I should be good to go after a week.  I repeat  FOUR  different doctors from municipal hospitals to private practices.  It felt like accurate enough diagnoses, and my foot was feeling better every day.  Thus, when I decided to stop at a private clinic my first morning on the way to the hospital (which would have saved my $2 in doctor’s fees, but possibly given me my fifth  ‘yep, all looks good´  prognosis), it must have been a blessing from above that I encountered a doctor who could both see and hear: he was the first one to notice that my big toe hung limp, like a dead piece of meat.  The others had not only missed it, but assured me that it was normal once I had pointed it out to them.  This doctor, however, acknowledged that it was a pretty serious problem, that I had cut a very important tendon and needed a serious operation immediately.  This news was, as can be imagined, a direct blow.  I just sat there, without a word coming to my mind for a couple of minutes, before the flood gates opened.   SHIT, this sucks, I’m screwed.  I need this foot.  How am I going to run?  How am I going to surf?  I can’t have an operation, I need to be traveling.  How on earth am I going to be able to pay for this…I have no insurance?   The first questions I needed answered were how long I would be out of commission and of course what this was going to cost me.  Both answers came as a serious blow upon arrival, but after a short time some calm and collected thoughts made me realize that $500 and 3 weeks of my life were not the biggest disaster in the world.  I spent the afternoon visiting three other clinics as well as the municipal hospital (who would do the operation for free, probably in a couple of months).  Realizing that I use that little sucker every day, with each step I take, it was pretty undisputed that I was gonna have to suck it up and get my operation.  Countless thoughts of anger and self-pity plagued me for the following couple of days, but I realized that this wasn’t as tragic as it may feel and that I was getting an operation from a doctor who I was comfortable was qualified and capable for a tenth of the price I would have been taken for back in the states.  “It’s just three weeks of your life man, you have two days and then you’ll be laid up for that time, so you better start getting ready”.  Thus, realizing that I would be alone, with no one to call, no one to care for me, no one to bring me anything and nothing to keep me entertained for 3 full weeks, while I was bed ridden, my first priority was to get myself a more comfortable room.  Maybe something with a/c and a TV so I wouldn’t spend 21 days staring at a blank wall through the sweat dripping into my eyes.  For 2 days I searched and each hotel that was reasonably affordable offered very little upgrade other than non-functioning air conditioners and a TV with 13 Spanish channels. Worst off, no other place had a kitchen which was important seeing that I couldn’t leave my house for three weeks.  I ended up deciding to stay where I was, going in halves on a $50 DVD player with one of my housemates and being lent a fan and a 4 inch black and white TV from another lovely young lady in the house.  Things weren’t looking so bad after all.  Beyond that, I did like 2 weeks worth of grocery shopping, stocking up on all of the essentials and bought every medical supply that could possibly be required after my surgery.  I already had 3 books and stole another two from the expansive library of a four-star hotel (like a hungry man stealing bread, that’s all).  This could be my last contact with the outside world for three weeks, and I was ready for it.  Going into my surgery, I was nervous as hell.  I felt like I was eight years old again, only my mommy wasn’t there.  I was almost blind going into this as the doctors office did not deem it necessary to prepare me for the procedure itself or what I could expect afterwards, even though I asked them a million questions.  They simply shot short answers, usually a “we’ll know better after the surgery”, and obviously could not comprehend that after the surgery I had nothing and no one, they were going to put me in a cab and I would not see the light of day or a helpful face until I returned two weeks later to have my stitches removed, I needed to know what medications I was going to need, if I would be able to walk to the store, can I buy or rent crutches, will I be in pain.  Of course, I had to do this all in Spanish.  They offered no answers.  Yep, I was terrified.  I asked them to turn the oxygen up and pretended to be in pain each time I felt the slightest contact from the procedure to get them to pump me up with more anesthesia.  I enjoyed my recovery period because my room was air conditioned and with a TV.  They finally had to kick me out, four hours later, helping me to a cab, who I paid to park illegally while I hoped into an international call center to let mom know that everything was alright.  Then he dropped me at my door and I made my way into my rented room, in this little group home I had found, dreading the next three weeks.

						     FINALLY, TO THE COAST     Ecuador´s Hippest Surf City   Even though I couldn’t surf, the beach was still calling me.  I left Izhcayluma and headed towards Ecuador’s surf capital, Montañita.  Montañita was once like every other village on Ecuador’s Southern coast, a sleepy, little fishing village almost unknown to anyone outside its residents.  It held one treasure though, that was bound to be discovered by exploring surfers, great waves.  This unearthing turned a small fishing town into a hippy, little surfing village that is now one of the most visited locations in Ecuador.  It is complete with a dozen hostels, plenty of cafes and restaurants and myriad tables and storefronts selling all sort and size of hippy-trinkets, from bracelets & headbands, to little surfboard keychains that say  Montañita  on them.  It’s a couple of decades shy of a full metamorphis into a Jaco or Tamarindo, Costa Rica, but still holds its charm with dirt roads, a good vibe and plenty of locals eating fresh oysters off bike stands.  As soon as I got there I ran into some American chicks and asked them if they knew a good place to stay.  Like Baños, the abundance of accommodations results in cut-throat prices, so I just had to take my pick of atmosphere.  The girls were staying at a nice place with a full restaurant run by the ever-present entrepreneurial Israelis.  They did, however, know this other place where crew of local surfers hung out.  It was basic, but $3/night got me a decent sized room and some killer amigos to chill with.  The scene was so cool it was almost depressing to be stuck practically immobilized by my foot.  Montañita ended up being one of those places where I could have stayed for quite some time, surfing all day, getting a bar job at night, eating fresh seafood right off the boats.  I fell into a crowd of talented surfers, none of whom worked, but all just chilled, surfed and hit the bars at night.  They hung together like pack of 15 wolves, cooking, eating, surfing, drinking and somehow maintaining the hostel I was in – though just barely.  Through my travels, one of my hopes is to learn about life, making discoveries and drawing my own conclusions.  After visiting Montañita, a new realization occurred to me.  People who live at the beach, specifically the Pacific Ocean, are almost enamored with a better spirit towards life.  It must be something about falling asleep to the sound of waves, or enjoying the infinite sunsets over the horizon, I am not exactly sure, but one thing is clear: each time I am on the Pacific, the people seem happier, friendlier and much more laid back.  While I had felt the invigoration of life in the “Valley of Longevity”, I certainly was induced immediately into a ' no-worries, life is great, the ocean sure is beautiful'  trans within minutes of arriving in Montañita.  It was just one of those places where you immediately charmed with a feeling of being welcomed, captivated by a sense of fitting in where within minutes you feel like a local, and have no preoccupations about just sitting down with a complete stranger, bullshitting for hours, like you were the best of friends.  Everyone is just happy to be there and happy that your there as well.  This almost stoned sensation of content reminded me of so many other places I have been: Dahab, Egypt, the Pacific Coastal towns in El Salvador and Costa Rica, even SoCal a little.  I may have stayed forever, but watching everyone else go out and surf every day while I tended my lame foot was too disheartening.  I decided, instead, to head up to Puerto Lopez and check out the Humpbacks.   Ballenas   In all of my travels, after all of my tours, one thing that I have never seen is whales.  In the summer, Ecuador becomes a playground for the Humpbacks making their way north from the Antarctic because of its sheltered, warm waters.  They are so plentiful outside of Puerto Lopez that $15 boat tours guarantee multiple sightings.  I rarely get excited about things.  I was cool as a cucumber before even coming to Ecuador, and I rarely begin to pack within a few days of a trip, even an extended one, but for days, I was excited about my trip to Puerto Lopez, like a young child is obsessed all week long with his Saturday morning little league game.  For $15, the price of seeing Humpback whales in the wild couldn’t be beat, although the boat and the weather both left a little to be desired and the combination of the two left almost the entire capacity of passengers sea sick.  It started off a beautiful morning and I was carried by one of the deck hands across the water so as to not get my foot wet.  The boat was as basic as could be and the clouds didn’t take long to roll in-I soon realized that this day would not be reminiscent of a leisurely weekend afternoon on the Great South Bay.  Nonetheless, I was there to see whales and nothing, including the ten green bodies, hanging over the side, spitting up the free, processed meat lunch what was included in the fifteen bucks, could distract me from that.  We searched for almost an hour, spotting a few in the distance, hoping that they would head towards us, as we are not allowed to go chasing them.  We saw spouts of water erupting like geysers from the surface here and there and then, finally, a pod headed our way.  There must have been over a dozen in all and there are few words to describe their majesty.  They were spectacular.  They followed along the boat, more or less, breaching consistently and occasionally displaying their fantastical skills, fully exploding out of the water to allow us to see just how enormous and beautiful they truly are.  Were cruised along side of them, no more than fifty feet away and they seemed almost as excited to spend the time with us as were to encounter them.  I know, however, that I was much more ecstatic, so enthralled and mesmerized that I pretty much left my camera down so as to not be at all distracted by the sea’s most wondrous creatures.  My weeklong excitement was justified and I spent the rest of the afternoon smiling, the images of these beautiful creatures vaulting out of the sea just to say  hi  and display their magnificence.  What a gift of a day.

						     A TRAGIC ENDING TO THE PERFECT LIFE    So, how do I keep stumbling upon these ridiculously sweet jobs?  Bartending in the Caribbean, Ski-bumming it in Killington, and the latest: chillin’ at a mountain resort/spa in Southern Ecuador.  I’ve concluded that these opportunities are infinite, and I’m really not that special, I just have the faith (and the balls), that something will work out for me.  There are millions of these opportunities out there, if you just go and look.  In this case, I headed down to Vilcabamba, not looking for a job, but planning on spending a week or so doing some serious hiking as well as a little R&R at one of the area’s little spa-like resorts offering a beautiful recluse for under $10/night.  Vilcabamba is in the southern lowlands of Ecuador, where the climate is much more enjoyable due to lower altitudes and also offers lusher hiking opportunities in the surrounding forested mountains.  My plan after Vilcabamba was a long-awaited surf break at the coast for a couple of months, so I wanted to get in as much hiking as I could here, knowing that I’d be off the circuit for a while.  Vilcabamba seemed to offer plentiful opportunities.  The small town, snuggled between some beautiful mountains, is known as the “Valley of Longevity”.  It earns this title from its mystical reputation for having the oldest population on earth.  It is rumored to be some kind of  fountain of youth , with no less than 10% of its population currently over the age of 100.  International studies have been conducted and answers to this enigma have been searched for, with hypothesis including the air, the water, the climate, mineral deposits, etc.  In the end, I discovered that it was just  magic .  After a few days there of strenuous activity, little sleep and pleasant sunshine, I consciously recognized that I couldn’t remember feeling more alive.  My intended stay there was extended for a couple of reasons.  I arrived at  Hosteria Izhcayluma  on a Monday night, where $7 bought me a bed in this gorgeous, spa-like, mini-resort.  Complete with splendid gardens, lagoon-like pool and Jacuzzi, cobbled paths, natural stone showers, a valley-view patio/dining area and a huge, bamboo bar with the works-it was here I’d spend my nights.  My first night at Izhcayluma happened to also be the current bartender’s last.  They were awaiting the new bartender to arrive from Germany in a couple of weeks, so the first morning I lunged on the opportunity to throw up my hands behind the bar again.  It was a perfect situation for the owner of the place and I was given free room, full-access to the stocked restaurant kitchen and of course unlimited drinks, in exchange for tending bar each night.   It only took a couple of days before my motivations for hiking dwindled and my days were spent lounging pool-side, reading a book and helping myself to the bar, relaxing and enjoying in this utopia-like life.  I was always preparing meals, cooking myself up feasts of shrimp, fish, calamari, chicken, fresh fruit juices and breads with the occasional cocktail as a complement.  During the day I lived like a Roman Prince in an indulgence of great food, rum and wine.  Night times were passed doing exactly what I would have been anyways, hanging at the bar.  The work was pretty easy, being a small place, there were never more than a dozen or so guests, all sticking to beer or  caipiriñas , a Brazilian specialty similar to a  mojito .  After happy-hour, drink requests slowed and I got to chill on the other side of the bar, swinging in a hammock or sitting by the bonfire with the rest of the guests.  Feasting during the day, tossing bottles at night and sporting a nice wine-buzz with a constantly changing crowd of friends: life couldn’t be sweeter.  My stroke of luck turned out to be a minor disaster, however, leaving me well behind my schedule and much lighter in the pockets.  On my last night there I was cutting some limes with my favorite knife in the kitchen, the biggest, heaviest sharpest one that just slid through anything it contacted.  I put the knife down for a second and it was bumped off the counter.  It knocked into my foot on the way down and hit pretty hard due to its weight.  I picked it up and went about my business.  About a minute and a half later I went to go throw some lime centers in the trash and when I stepped, a searing pain shot up my foot through my shin.  Damn, I thought, I must have bruised it pretty bad; I hope this doesn’t interfere with my surfing.  This thought worried me for the split second that it took my eyes to register a pool of the darkest, thickest blood I have ever seen in my life.  I am told blood appears this way when it is less-oxygenated, resulting from the haste with which it has rushed out of the veins.   My heart just froze.  I felt very little pain, but evidently, the knife had fallen directly into my foot point-down.  Rushed to the local hospital, I was seen by a doctor immediately, stitched up, given a tetanus shot, pain killers and bandages to change with.  The beautiful, young doctor assured me that the wound was just superficial and that I only cut the skin.  I would have limited activity for up to a month, but could then begin hiking and running again.  A pretty discouraging setback and my surfing safari certainly   would   be interrupted.  Beyond my lack of sports, my biggest worry was the cost of this.  I am traveling uninsured concerned as to how much this was all gonna set me back.  It turned out to be a rather affordable claim after all: the whole ordeal, including doctor, meds, shots, etc - $6.  Extremely affordable, but still very disheartened that I was out of commission for a while; it looks like I wasn’t leaving Izhcayluma just yet.  Back to the bar for some sweet, dark rum and my mind should be taken off my worries.

						     ECUADOR'S MOST CAPTIVATING COLONIAL CITY        Evidently I hadn’t quite recovered from my stomach ailment.  At least not enough to allow quantities of food and drink that I consumed at the Fiesta that day, so, on my 10 hour night bus from Quito to Cuenca, I strategically choose my seat at the very back of the bus.  My reasons were two-fold.  In Latin American, in every country I’ve visited, on every bus I’ve ridden, the locals choose to occupy the very front seats first, filling them to absolute capacity before daring to go back just one more row where they could enjoy a nice breezy window, spare space for their belongings and perhaps a little solitude for the long journey ahead.  This is most dramatic on the local buses.  In Guatemala, for example, the Indians will sit three full grown adults with children in their laps and bags of produce, livestock, etc at their feet all into one-side of a little school bus bench (6 adults  et al  in total) while the next seat behind remains completely unoccupied.  They sit, squeeze and sweat together while a beautiful oasis of green vinyl lies in the depths beyond.  Thus, I always bomb straight for the back.  Being a gringo gives me a little advantage, you’re the last they choose to sit with anyways, but going back towards into the undesirable almost ensures that I’ll have the seat to myself all night.  That’s the first reason I chose the back (and I figured the continual passing of gas would be less resented if I were in the quiet section).  My other strategic reasoning was to be right next to the bathroom, which I made sure existed before boarding.  Existed yes, functioned, no.  So, for the next ten hours, while other commuters tried to nod off, I woke every hour, and had the bus driver pull off to the side of the road, carrying off my roll of TP and leaning against the back of the bus to support my weight as I went about business.  Of course, each time a re-boarded, the entire cabin had awakened, wondering why we were stopped.  I had no choice but to look into their wondering eyes as I made my way to the very last seat.  Again, there is no place for humility when traveling.  I felt much better, somehow, arriving in Cuenca.  It’s an absolutely beautiful city, large but entirely colonial with a riverside that makes for a nice walk.  With many plazas, churches and historic buildings, the city seemed to exist only for me to wander that Sunday, as everything was shut down and souls were nowhere to be found. It was a nice day, the actual 4th of July, and I called home, a little lonely, knowing what I would find on the other end, a pleasantly buzzed set of parents, enjoying company, food and plenty of frozen cocktails out on the pool deck.  Making me more homesick, I needed a little dose of familiarity, so I headed to join all of Cuenca’s lost Sunday souls where any right Ecuadorian heads on the weekends, to the shopping mall.  Again, to comment on Latin America.  For countries so poor with people having so little, I have never seen more glamorous, elaborate and extensive shopping malls.  Guatemala City, San Jose, Quito, Cuenca, everywhere I go.  I mean you’re talking about shops that can barely afford a Madison Avenue address catering to people who live in a country that is 80% poor.  Everything you could ask for in a mall, multiple stories, designer boutiques, 20 theater cineplexes and infinite cappuccinos: this was exactly what I needed for my bout with homesickness.  Cuenca would have been a nice place to stay a while, but I headed out the next morning.  I was really anxious to get to the almost mythical “Valley of Longevity”, Vilcabamba.

						     A 4TH OF JULY BBQ UNLIKE ANY OTHER        I had just spent a few days in bed, missing some great opportunities in Baños, and it was 4th of July weekend, making me a little homesick, knowing all the fun I would be missing back in the States: cold beer, good tunes, smoking BBQ. I was in need of a party atmosphere and some company. What a perfect time to be invited to a local fiesta at Hacienda San Jose, the same farm from which I climbed Illinzas Norte a few weeks earlier. Rodrigo and German had spent months planning out this event, expecting over 100 people, all locals-mostly family and friends. They spared no energy and no expense in organizing the day’s festivities. I brought the German chick and was immediately treated like family, in fact, I almost felt like the guest of honor. As I mentioned in my story on the Illinizas summit, this Hacienda is a full-blown working farm. It is enormous and the perfect place for 120 friends and family to gather. So well-organized, German had set up a schedule of the day’s events, including paint ball, bull-fighting, horseback riding, live entertainment and food cooking all-day long. We started off with a couple of games of paintball back in the woods. Working up an appetite, by the time the wars were over, the first round of food was ready. Drinks were cold, music was playing and everyone was feasting on corn, potatoes, salads, salsas and cheeses. People were pigging out, but I played it smart. I knew what was to come. All day long, the Indian women who work the farm had been grilling up what must have three been three full cows. Cut into slabs, there was more meat piled up and smoking away and on top of this, they must have had a gross of whole chickens. Before the meat was ready, though, we were going to be entertained with a little bullfighting demonstration by some hired professionals.  We watched as these matadors gracefully and fluidly tempted the bull to charge them and then, as if blown by a small breeze, moved out of its way to let it pass. They really made it look so simple that when German asked me if I wanted to give it a try, I didn’t hesitate.  Now, I’ve already demonstrated how,  on occasion , I might overestimate my capabilities. Well, I watched these matadors and reckoned, “Hell, I’m quick, I could handle this”. They had four bulls in total, the final to be a fully-grown monster, while the first was a shoulder-height younger bull, but still with horns at least 8 inches long. This is the bull that I faced. I grabbed the cape and the matadors left the ring for me to have my sport. With at least 100 spectators, I started prompting the bull, waving the magenta cape in its face, trying to get it to charge. It just wouldn’t come. I kept getting closer and closer, a little embarrassed that he wouldn’t come at me, and then finally, with a “rrrrrrhhhhhmmmmmmm”, it bolted straight for me. Evidently, there’s more to this sport than speed and confidence, it might help to have a little skill. While I should be quick enough and am certain that I felt confident at that time, perhaps a little too confident, something was missing because the bull’s charge, which I tried to avoid, made a direct hit, his head coming straight on and landing its horns into my gut. I wasn’t pierced, but I was knocked right on my ass and then trampled, he came back and stomped over me again and I was rescued by the matadors while the crowd looked on, surely entertained. Granted, it may not have been a life-threatening situation. I’m sure this little fella would have been passed up if he tried out for a position in Pamplona, but he was big enough to scare the hell out of me. I got up, shaking off a little dust and a lot of humility and smiled. The crowd seemed pleased, and I kept going with him. I wasn’t trampled again, but certainly found myself running full speed in circles around the perimeter of the ring while he chased in furious pursuit.  I tried again with the next larger bull. His horns were quite bigger and the format was a little different. A little more chaotic, a little more comforting, we were all on the ring at the same time, pretty much just antagonizing the poor creature. Picture the geek in the playground with a “kick me” sign on his back. Each time he gets kicked in the ass and turns around to face his antagonist, someone else lands their foot on his backside. He goes temporarily insane through a combination of anger, frustration, humility and confusion. So, we all just kept smacking the bull on his head and ducking away, while he charged, someone else would come up and instigate him- interesting form of entertainment, I reckon, but, then again, I have difficult enough time with British humor.  The rain came in, which was a shame, but probably a stroke of fortune for me. After the second bull, German asked me if I would be interested in the final challenge of the event. The fourth bull, the fully-grown, potentially deadly one, comes out with a stuffed heart tied between its horns. The goal of the matador,   me  , is to remove this heart with his hands, thus emerging as the day’s triumphant champion. I accepted, again with an overconfidence bordering on arrogant stupidity, and would have given it my best, with dreams of awarding my stuffed heart to the love of my choice, as the day’s princely hero, living fantasies reminiscent of Hemmingway’s  “The Sun Also Rises” . Of course, I imagine that’s not quite how it would have gone and the only maiden whose acquaintances I would make would be a nurse at the local hospital.  Fatefully avoiding that mishap, the feast began. Disappointed in not conquering a live bull, I settled for being triumphant in conquering his slain, roasted and delicious maidens and no less than four of their feathered friends. Beef and chicken I mean…at the BBQ. God, the food was so good and I made up for my previous week’s flushing from my stomach virus. It started pouring, so the music, food, bar, and guests, moved inside. The  canela  was warmed (no chicha this time) and the drinking to an almost Indigenous passion (check the story on Inti Raymi) commenced. Having a long overnight bus ride ahead of me, I escaped by hitching a ride back to Quito with some of the family- sober  ones of course. What a great way to celebrate the Fourth of July. While reminiscent of the concurrent festivities at home, the food, drinks, music and company, I have never seen a backyard BBQ to this extent.

						     TIME TO TONE IT DOWN A NOTCH    After Cotopaxi, I had just about my fill of climbing for the sake of climbing. I had enough of trying to make it to the summit in the shortest amount of time possible, breaking the time records, but barely noticing the scenery along the way. I was ready to tone it down a notch, take things a little slower, stop and enjoy the sights around me. I remembered how much I like Baños when I was there with Javier. It seemed like a beautiful little city, surrounded by lush jungle and green mountains, a relaxed place where tons of other travelers gather, resulting in a fine selection of hotels, cafes, book exchanges and other backpacker friendly resources. Well, this is exactly what it was.  It really is a cool city and the competition among establishments catering to tourists keep the prices down to some of the lowest in Ecuador while offering some of the best standards. There’s a nice central plaza in front of the  Church of the Virgin of the Water , who the locals worship emphatically for her protection over the destructively active Volcan Tungurahua, which looms, dangerously, over the city. There’s a nice pedestrian street with little shops and sweet shacks, each with a large peg nailed at the top of the doorway from which, all day long, the  sugarmen  pull fresh taffy, made from panela (natural sugar) and cheerfully & zealously offer enormous free samples to everyone passing by. It’s a great city and I found people to hike with, eat with, and go to the bars with each day. Some were new friends; others were travelers I had met elsewhere in Ecuador. It is amazing how often and how many miles away you run into the same people. Travelers follow the same guide books and the same beaten paths and it is common to see similar faces over and over again, sometimes just a few days apart, sometimes, months down the road, in different cities, even countries. I constantly encounter familiar faces in my travels, sometimes seeing the same person close to 10 different times in different places. Baños was one of those places. I ended up making plans for a few days with this German girl, but unfortunately had to keep bailing – first on our mountain biking trip, then on the waterfalls and hiking. I picked up a sour stomach for the fourth time (counting the two times before my big climbs) which is kind of unusual. Traveling in the third world, especially for an extended period of time, you have to expect that you are going to get sick, terribly sick. I can’t help but be amused when I see someone in a hostel brushing their teeth with bottled water. Later on I ask them, “so for how long are you traveling?” “Oh, for about a year,” they respond. I mean, seriously, to travel for a long period of time, it is absolutely impossible to avoid every foreign bacteria, parasite, element, etc. Your body is just gonna have to get used to it. Avoiding it to the extremes of brushing your teeth with bottled water only puts off the inevitable. You’re best hope is to take in, little by little, the things that you’re body is not used to, gradually developing immunity to it. You certainly shouldn’t stroll down here and start sucking down tap water or eating raw shellfish, but to think you can avoid every foreign bacteria is lunacy. At some point, it is going to get ya The best thing you can hope for is that it hits you once and it hits you hard. This is how it was for me in Central America. In Roatan, my third week there, for 72 hours I wished I were dead. It was a miserable stomach virus, with all of the works I’d rather not describe. But after that, I was golden. My immunity was established and I felt like my iron stomach would allow me to eat off the floor. This time, it’s been hitting me in much less dramatic stages, but more frequently. In Baños it really cleaned me out good and I am hoping that a few days recovering there, although having to ditch my plans with this hot German chick, and worst of all, explain to her why (although there is little humility between travelers), will leave me good to go for a while, at least for the Fiesta that I was invited to that Saturday.

						      TWO PLEASANT WEEKS OF REST AND RELAXATION    Well, it’s been over two weeks since my procedure and I am still here on Isla Margarita.  I guess there are places to be stuck with worse names than  Isla Margarita , however, in all reality, in the three weeks, to the day, that I have been here, I have yet to see the sea and certainly haven’t been sipping on any Margaritas.  Both the surgery and recuperation went ok - actually better than ok, as these past two weeks have almost been a blessing in disguise.   With a cast and plenty of painkillers, my duties to attending this wound were minimal.  I basically just had to sit still, in my bed and let time pass.  Fortunately, I had a good stock of books, a TV/DVD (even if barely viewable) and what ended up being a house full of nurses, cooks, cleaning ladies, friends, mothers, sisters, you name it.  It is amazing how things turn out.  For the two days following my surgery, I was more preoccupied with escaping the torturous chamber where I currently resided than I was with the procedure itself.  I thought that staying in that place would drive me crazy.  AS it turns out, I have everything that I need.  Plenty of light and air, entertainment, food and most of all, a group dedicated to helping me.  You can not imagine how I have been taken in, a complete stranger, as one of a family of families.  The people I live with are from all over South America, mostly Venezuela and Columbia, but almost form a collective family unit that immediately adopted me.  I actually reckoned that it might work out well before hand.  I figured at least I could ask someone to pick me up some necessities from the store.  What I was blessed with was a group of woman who are caring for me like my own personal nurses.  Cooking my food, washing my clothes, carrying my stuff into my room, changing my sheets, making me coffee, doing my shopping - it is unbelievable.  The one girl gave me her TV and fan, another guy works at a video place and brings me new DVds every day.  I am hesitant to say this, but I don’t know if I could have received this level of care and attention at home.  People are always around, the women at least who don’t work, and on top of all of these services, I have been the fortunate recipient of some great, warm, friendly companionship.  These women have become like a little family for me.   So, I’ve basically just been relaxing in my room, entertaining myself with books and flicks and lingering in my own personal thoughts.  My new family has not allowed me to do anything, which was great at first, but little by little, as I recover, I’ve had to claim back some of my responsibilities.  The first few days I couldn’t walk.  I could hop from my bedroom to the kitchen and I earned myself the nickname  canguro  (kangaroo in Spanish).  Worst of all was that I couldn’t bath for the first few days, but seeing as I was essentially immobile, there was little urgency to it.  Thus, I just sat, and waited for my first chance to bathe, my first opportunity to use the internet, the first time I could walk using two feet, even for a short distance, and of course the point at which I could commence exercise, no matter how minimal.  All of these gradually came after a few days and I was beginning to cook a little for myself, was able to hop the 1 block to the internet café, where I have come everyday since for an average of 4 hours per day.  It has been a pretty typical recovery a very atypical situation.  Again, it is amazing how days can go by so quickly.  People don’t understand what I do with my time when I am traveling and I certainly had no idea how to pass the endless hours upon recovery, but somehow, they pass, through reading, journal writing or just thinking, it has become a pleasant period of rest and relaxation and I have actually felt great.  I have actually enjoyed this time, making the most mundane tasks, such as making coffee, into and event. Best of all it has given me nothing to do but think and reflect and I can not remember ever feeling so good and clear headed.  My spirits have been amazingly high despite my unfortunate situation and I’m not so sure I even want it to end.  I have also had the opportunity to catch up on this travel journal, publish my photos online, and contact most of my friends and family.  Quite a blessing in disguise I conclude.  There have been some memorable aspects to all of this.  I won’t forget the hours spent making cups of coffee, sometimes drinking coffee simply to entertain myself through the process of making it.  Cold showers are bearable, but not desirable, showers in a plastic chair with one foot bagged and elevated outside the shower on another plastic chair suck, showers with 2, 3-gallon buckets of water and a small cup because there is no running water 80% of the time is horrendous.  Combine these three elements and you are invited into the nightmare that I go through everyday for over an hour.  Eating, surprisingly, has been some of the best I’ve had in my travels yet.  What do all islands have in common?  They are surrounded by water.  What does all water have in common?  Fish live in it.  What do all third world countries have in common?  Poor people looking to make a living using whatever means they can.  Thus, I find myself in a magical world of the cheapest seafood buffets imaginable.  I am talking about buying freshly caught, shelled, cooked & cleaned oysters, clams, mussels, calamari, octopus, conch…you name it…for the grand price of $0.40/lb.  No, there’s not a decimal place error, 40 cents buys me a pound of fresh shellfish meat, about the size of a sandwich bag packed full of giant mussels, or little neck clams and a selection of types I have never seen.  Thus, each day is a seafood buffet for me.  That and the almost-free produce feed me pretty well and are a nice complement to my coffee.  Sunday’s are always a big day, when I buy a few nights worth and prepare some kind of stew, rather than just eating them cold with lime and onion, like the locals.  My appearance has become quite an interesting sight as a result of this as well.  Having been so active before my incident with the knife, I had already shed about 5 lbs and left my body with absolutely no fat reserves from which to draw.  I must have dipped below 4% body fat in my most active weeks and things have not improved since I got here.  My sloth-like immobility, along with the heat and inability to prepare much, left my appetite minimal.  I thus have not been eating too much and certainly not exercising, so my body has kind of withered away, leaving me a description that can barely be defined as lean and athletic any longer, but is bordering flat out skinny.  I can feel that my body has started to attack my muscles as its energy reserve, but fortunately, while my size has dwindled, my muscular tone maintains and a few weeks back on the program should build me back up pretty well.  Adding to this new look, I decided to grow a mustache.  Not because I find it complementing, but in following the same sentiment with which I have decided not cut my hair for a year now:  What the hell .  I’ve got no one to impress and since I’ve already read my 5 books and the 2 others that I claimed in a subsequent raid on the same hotel, I am quite lacking in entertainment.  This moustache provides me a little comical relief each time I hobble my way in front of the mirror.  Thus, I am an image of the typical, grungy backpacker at the moment.  Long, stringy, sun-bleached blond hair that constantly needs to be held in a headband, a pathetic little dirt-stache above my lip and my lean, skinny frame, looking like a shell of someone who used to once work-out, but is now allowing himself to wither away.  Not to worry though, I reckon a few weeks of some good exercise, a clean shave and some long-awaited sun and I’ll be back to new, for better or worse.  And that’s basically my recovery thus far.  I’m still in the cast, hobbling down the street everyday to use the internet and visit my local friends at their market stands and seafood stalls.  I’ve become quite a prominent figure on the two little blocks I frequent in this corner of the city.  I’m obviously recognizable as the only limp gringo in town and am greeted by each store front and street stand with a nice wave or a questions as to how my foots coming along.  ‘ Poco a Poco ’ I respond, meaning  little by little .  I keep looking for ways to thank the girls that I live with for being so great: flowers, pearls that I find inside my oyster, and recently I bought them a universal remote so that they didn’t have to change their 8 inch communal TV with a stick any longer.  I couldn’t have felt less fortunate when I first got injured.  Then I felt angered and sorry for myself when I found out I needed surgery.  Surprisingly, though, these have been a pretty incredible couple of weeks, I’ve created some humorous and interesting memories, made new friends and family, Caught up with my readings and writings, read 7 novels, and even developed a new, hippy, grungy look that I will be happy to rid of once the game is over.  The best part though, was an opportunity to take some time to think and reflect and remember, because hell, there really isn’t much else to do when your shacked up for three weeks in a poor little room on a Caribbean Island.
