      SO I talked to Brandon today for about 20 or so minutes. It was kind of nice talking to him again. We talked about everything from younglife, to new boys in my life, to his new girlfriend. A Part of me does kind of miss him but another part doesn't miss him. I just miss how good of a cuddler he was. He leaves in about 2 weeks for college and I probably won't see him again until christmas break. oh well.  &nbsp; Oh and Athony didn't call. that bastard.

      Chris Isaak's "Wicked Game" has been my utmost favorite song for years. I remember when I first heard that suave voice on VH1's Sexiest videos countdown. It was such a sneaky little thing to do to watch that video when I was 8 years old. But even then, the black and white, the perfect chords and melody, and the gorgeous presentation of the model's body. I'm not a lesbian myself or bisexual in anyway, I just know a nice female body when I see one. They did not do it in an untasteful manner, but very classy. I like. I'm putting this song on repeat...

       I really hate hearing bad things about a person you just met that seems so nice. But the thing is... that I know he isn't. I'm ignoring the 'stay away' comments from my friends and really, instead of making me repulsed by the facts I hear, I'm being drawn in. I met this guy named Anthony at a Dave Matthews band concert last month and we really hit it off. Sure he was drunk, but he was really nice afterwards too when he called me. He's everything I really do not need. I lied to me about his grade in his college classes, he has a fake I.D., and he's raunchy... and all the while... I'm  REALLY  attracted to that. Maybe its the fact that I look too much into guys. I expect too much out of them. Those expectations kind of drove away my past relationships. I expected them to do that.. I expected them to do this... and its just got really tiring and boring! I'm in a point in my life where I do want to explore my more fun experimenting side. I'm not saying sleeping with guys and just making out with random guys. I would like to have some sort of fling. Just a fun little... fling! I think I might call this tony guy. just see what happens. I'm ready for some fun.

      You’ve got your ball You’ve got your chain Tied to me tight tie me up again Who’s got their claws In you my friend Into your heart I’ll beat again Sweet like candy to my soul Sweet you rock And sweet you roll Lost for you I’m so lost for you You come crash into me And I come into you I come into you In a boys dream In a boys dream Touch your lips just so I know In your eyes, love, it glows so I’m bare boned and crazy for you When you come crash Into me, baby And I come into you In a boys dream In a boys dream If I’ve gone overboard Then I’m begging you To forgive me In my haste When I’m holding you so girl Close to me Oh and you come crash Into me, baby And I come into you Hike up your skirt a little more And show the world to me Hike up your skirt a little more And show your world to me In a boys dream.. in a boys dream Oh I watch you there Through the window And I stare at you You wear nothing but you Wear it so well Tied up and twisted The way I’d like to be For you, for me, come crash Into me.
