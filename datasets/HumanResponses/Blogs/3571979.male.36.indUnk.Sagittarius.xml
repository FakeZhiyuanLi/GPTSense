      Today I have mourned the death of our 40th President, Ronald Reagan.  He was someone I admired for the way he conducted his life and the respect he gave others.  I have watched the funeral in California tonight on my TV and I must say I was quite moved.    Our military is just awe inspiring in the amount of respect they are able to give to someone.  The attention to detail and reverence they show are truly noteworthy.  I watched with tears in my eyes as they fired canons 21 times, gave a 21 gun salute with rifles, flew the missing man tribute flyover, folded the flag from his casket and gave it to Nancy.  Very, very moving.  Also something I found so awesome was the way our soldiers kept the casket completely level at all times even while moving up and down stairs.  Our military is the BEST!!!  They make me so proud to be an American!!  God Bless Ronald Reagan and God Bless America!

      Today my beloved Cubs were spanked by the hated deadbirds from St. Louis. I really don't have much to say about this except for wait till tomorrow.  I'm in the process of trying to buy a house and sell mine at the same time. If you have ever went through the anguish of trying to sell your house you'll no what I mean when I say it's about to send me over the edge. We have a potential buyer with some credit problems and I'm wondering it they are even worth messing with. It is extremely frustrating to try to say the least. I am trying to purchase from my wife's uncle and he is being very accomodating but I know at some point he is going to need to list his house. I can't do both and need to sell mine first. Herein lies the problem. Anybody looking for a nice 3 BR in Greenview, IL?   Highlight of my day: Haircut! Kind of says something about my life huh?

      OK. here goes. As I travel into the world of blogging, I question whether or not I have enough interesting in my life to comment about on a semi regular basis. I figure I should be able to come up with something!   Well to start my name is John Dixon and I live in Greenview, IL. I am married and have 3 boys which keep us pretty busy.   I'll give more particulars later as I am mostly anxious to just see if this is working as advertised.

      Vacation is just around the corner and can't come soon enough as far as I'm concerned.&nbsp; I am soooo ready.&nbsp; We are heading to St. Louis for a couple of days and then on to Branson.&nbsp; We are just going to mess around in Branson and see some caves in the area. I will be posting on a more regular basis once we're back.
