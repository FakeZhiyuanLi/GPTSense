       This is just some things i think are funny, or stupid things    ive done in the past...(there WILL be more to come) ok one time well    this past summer (2004), my mom told me to take her cam coreder to film    me and my cuzin bratney (stevens), cuz i went there to stay for 3 days.. well    i took that thing with me every where... we went to the beach, then that night   we ordered pizza, when the pizza guy came i recoreded him... i tell him to wave to the camera for me and bratney then he just walk away..... the next day we went to ecered   and filmed jeremy's hisle(the one with makeup) hahaha, then we went to wal-mart and i been walkin around recording ppl. and the mexicans. lmao, thats where i met woody the cashier. he still work there too.     oh and in wal-mart, ron my little cuzin (9yrs) put on a huge bra and he rub himself and said "Michael Jackson loves me". HA HA HA. another time was when bratney and i went trick or treating 2 halloweens ago when the ppl answered thier door and gave us tha candy we said merry christmas .     one time in wal-mart (with my cuzin tuffany and her friend carl,) i walk up to some guy and started reading Dr. suess' book (green eggs and ham) he just been starrin at me then thats when i said 'ok now you read this page" and he started reading every page i asked him to read to me. as i started walkin away i told him i'll be back with the cat in the hat, by the time i got back he been gone, i been walkin up and down each isle yelling where you at. why you runnin.       another time was when me and my cuzin J been prank callin ppl. first when they would pick up we would say this is the my little pony hot- line thank you for listening to the following song....thats when we would sing....My little pony, my little pony come along and play with me, thank you and have a great day.    then i called this one guy and when he picked up and saidhello i said may i asked whos calling, then he goes noooo may "I" ask whos calling thats when i said im sorry you have the wrong number. and i hung up......   then i called another person and said hello diss china town did you order fortune cookie may 5th 2001... she said no i go oh ok tank you thankyou verymuch..      one time me and J been at the mall outside in Westashley waiting for her momma to pick us up, well i look to my left and riding by in front of us was a cadilac on like 20s   then i saw a guy who look just like little jon with the glasses and hat and dreads and every thing. he was sitting in the passenger side of the car. so i started jumping up and down waveing my hand, and screaming like a lil white gurl and saying LITTLE JON I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS.. KEEP IT GANGSTER... HAHAHAHHA. all the blck ppl where laughing they ass off.       for the following story you would have to be there to get a laugh out of it... ok me and J where drawling and i was drawling MY little pony (the actuall words) and by the time i got to the T in littlei go,, boi dis T look sadder than the one jesus died on...then i pause and go hold up.. jesus aint die on no T that man die on a cross. thats when we bust out laughing.      steven asked brandon frasier if he in the unh unh class, brandon say unh unh         i was talkin to jennifer and i go where was i cuz i was in the middle of rehursing the lion king, and i meant to say oh yeah the part where its dark and simba and mufasa are in the savanna and mufasa punishes him, but instead i go where was i ....oh yeah , the part where mufasa takes simba in the woods and punish him...     ____________________________________________________      back again with some more of my crackheaded moments......      ok one time i been in class right ( this was in 9th grade last year)   and i sat inside the recycling bin and i pretended it was my nest and i started to    make this pigion noise.
