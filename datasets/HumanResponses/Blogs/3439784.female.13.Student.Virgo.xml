      Definitions.  Respect:To feel or show deferential regard for; esteem.  Spite:Malicious ill will prompting an urge to hurt or humiliate. Pettiness:Marked by narrowness of mind, ideas, or views.  Love:A feeling of intense desire and attraction toward a person with whom one is disposed to make a pair; the emotion of sex and romance.   Okay, so in consideration of the words and those meanings. here i what i think of them.  Respect: its a really strong word i think..and its a feeling that needs to be used for often.its something that is SO SO important in any relationship.   Spite: i like this word. i feel it often. well, i dont feel spite to other people, but ive felt spite from other people.its a bad feeling, a really frusterating feeling.  Pettiness: ha ha so many people possess this, yet have no clue they do. i like this word. im going to use it often. haha  Love: whoooa this term is SOOO over used!! i mean...its silly to think that so many people believe theyre in love, and that its the only thing important to them..until, they break up, and their left with a broken heart and a feeling of stupidity and naiveness.   so,i have nothing much to say. only that....its hard to realize what kind of person you are at this age..because of all the affects people and media and such have on you. mostly negative ones..and its hard to watch good people getting into bad stuff. i mean, i hope to god that if i got into really bad stuff theyd kick me in the ass..wait..scratch that..they'd sit me down and knock some sense into me. because...i dont know.. i think people are so obsorbed in wanting to be curious that theyve forgotten who they are and who they want to be. by curious i mean..like trying new things that are bad for you. and getting hooked. and being influenced that its a cool thing. its not. its rotten.   one of the worst feelings in the world is not knowing what you want. its like your body is split in three. on the left side, its a strong feeling. and on the right side its another equally strong feeling, but the oposite to the first one. and in the middle, is a mix of the two feelings...(the middle being your heart mostly)..and..the two feelings mixed together makes one big unsure feeling. and its a bad feeling. because in the process of not knowing what to feel, other people get hurt. because you cant make up your mind. and its either you've held on to them too long and led them on, or you've let go of what could've been.  anywho too much thinking for me. ciao.

      wowsers this weekend has been long/fun. so, friday night i did like nothing. it was sad. i basically went to my brothers art show, which was interesting, but im not an art freak because i suck ass at art. so it was kind of boring too. so i was in a real piss mood, so i sat in my room and wrote like 5 pages in my journal. again, rather pathetic. im such a loser. then i sat in the dark and listened to like 10 of my burned cds (straight through.) hahahaha. so, saturday em came over at around 2 or something. and we wanted to make dessert. so we went to her house because my house=anti-baking. hahahaha. we made cherry cheese cake. it was an experience because ive never made/ate it before. we rock at making it, i swear we're so pro haha, it was so good. so then we went back to my house and em made me swim. it was cold but nice, and i attempted to tan, but im scotish so its impossible for me. so after that i straightened by hair and got ready for the dance recital that im not in. haha! we ate supper (perogies..love! and hamburgers...:P) and then jess came over, because she was coming to the recital too. so then we went, and it was actually pretty good, i enjoyed it. too bad i wasnt there, i swear our dances were the best ones there. so after we dropped jess off. em showed me kates house and i was like "hey, kate is having a party. lets go say hi!" and em was like "WOW! super cool idea!" so we went. and kate, erin, vanessa, mark, mike, evan , tim and ray were there. the new people i met was all the guys except tim. it was cool. kate has like the wickedest house ever, its so gorgeous and huge. wow. we wanted to stay but my mom was waiting outside so we couldnt. so then i went to ems for a sleepover. she made me watch swiss family robinson, some movie made i swear in like 50's. haha it was still pretty cool, but this kid francis really bugged me. and we ate popcorn and drank coke. and talked for like hours. and em made orgasmic moaning sounds which i thought was gross and funny all at once. haha.  then today, we woke up and walked to tim hortons, by my request. and i had a large apple cidar(..love..) and a honey dip donut. yum. then we walked home and i swear i spilled my apple cidar like...239 times! it was amusing for em. not me. so then we walked to my house to swim, and we were determined to tan. haha i was like "im not wearing sunscreen! psht i wont burn who cares!" so we werein the pool for like 2 hrs. and we pigged out on salsa and tostitos, and also cherry cheese cake. yummm! then em went home and i showered and lazed around. then i realized i was sooo burned! ahh im so red. you can see exactly where my bathing suit was. haha its so funny. but i put this cream on that will hopefully turn it into a tan hahahaha. so i guess we'll see how it is tomorrow. haha!  ♥chellaa!♥  p.s. i didnt do any hw this wknd. its so bad. grrr, i hate school!

      friday- wow it was the last day of school. i was a little down all day because it was a sad/happy time...at the end of the day the tears hit. it may sound stupid because i mean wow, im out of elementary school into highschooL! and i am excited, but its just ive been at that school for 9 years, and i had the best year of my whole gateway experience this year. its when the bell rang and everyone was saying bye to mr.v, the best teacher ever! the girls stood around crying for like a half an hour, it was honestly pathetic but it couldnt be helped. Then that night was Chris's grad party. i mean, in my last entry i said that there was a lot of stuff going on..well that doesnt compare to everything at Chris's! it was like frigin soap opera, it was funny and retarded all at once. but we had a good time, we sat in the hot tub a lot, we stayed until like 1 am..good times! chris was sad..aww him sad made me sad...because he is moving up north to go to a rich private school..aww im going to miss chris! he always kept the group talking and laughing, always! after the party we went to shaunas and slept over, jenn, taylin, sheena, shauna and i. it was pretty fun too.   Saturday- i hung out at em's  allllllll  day long! and we did nothing! but it was still great! we watched like half of remember the titans, we ate like crazy, we had a romantic strawberry eating fest in the middle of the field on a blanket. i lost 30$! we were fighting desperately to find plans but we couldnt. so we just bummed around! t'was grrrrreat!  Sunday- well rob and matty called me at around 1:30, so i went to mattys, then when i got there we called josh. at joshs house was ian carly n shauna. so we all hung out, and we did like nothing..went to the park, watched tv, played cards etc. i went home at like 5. i couldve gone to the movies, but i didnt really want to see what they were seeing plus i lost my money haha so i couldnt anyway. i was supposed to clean my room but id idnt, i watched secret window with my mom. it was really confusing i didnt quite understand it. oh well..  Monday- i cleaned my room  all  afternoon!!  it's so clean im sooo proud and impressed! so then shauna called me and asked me to hang out later then sleep over, so i did so. shauna, josh, ian, matty, robert, austin, em and i hung out. we didnt nothing again all night, but it was still fun. then shauna and i had a sleepover, and we like....i dunno we put on weird radio stations and did these dance/play things. it was so retarded but awesome! they could be famous, so could we if we wanted to be.  Today- well i woke up early and i had a orthodontist appt... GUESS WHAT!?   im probably going to my braces off in like..2 months!most likely before school starts! YESHHHHHHHHHH! im so happy. i dunno what im doing today, probably just lazing around and hanging out. mehhh!!  anywho...yes yes, im in a pretty good mood, im not pissy about anything too in particular at the moment. i'll let you know when i am. haha! ciaoo!  -chels-

      ahh grad was tonight! it was amazing..all the girls looked so gorgeous it was great. sooo much stuff is going on right now, its so funny how much drama fills teenage life.  SOOOOOOOOOO  much! i would list everything must most of is personal and not meant to be said. wow..i just cant believe that im in grade 9 now, practically. its crazy but awesome! i went and hugged everyone..and it was almost sad to think i may never hug them again and have a conversation with them again. i'm really going to miss people next year, and the funny thing is i'll probably miss the people that im not close to the most...because the people im close to i'll probably be close to next year too. well..this is dedicated to my grade 8 year.. it was awesome.. to all the people who i wont get to see next year, I LOVE YOU!!!!

      so my weekend was..  friday- em and i hung out...we had a sleep over and did our usual, except we didnt get to talk as much ebcause we fell asleep!! we got bored so we put on our all time fav.. "a walk to remember" and..we fell asleep. this is the second time this has happened to us without us remembering what happened.   saturday- em stayed till around 2 or so, then sarah and i went to value village lol to get costumes for our romeo and juliet play. then later that night we went to the movies and saw "raising helen" it was a really good movie  sunday- i had soccer pictures, and the rest of the day i lazed around and did virtually nothing. fun fun!  sunday night- i slept for an hour, then i woke up to rather loud rain and i shut my window...and it was disgustingly HUMID in my room! so i couldnt sleep for another 3 hours...then i fell asleep   today- we did our romeo and juliet play, and i must say i think sarah and i did rather well. hm..the rest of the day was basically a waste of time...i had baseball practise after school, but i really sucked because..i was not in the mood, i just wanted to get home and shower!  this week im in ottawa. whoopee! we leave tomorrow at approx. 6:30 a.m. or so. i hope its fun! tomorrow night we have a dance on a cruise ship w/ other schools, so hopefully that goes good. honestly nothing else exciting is happening. boring life i have. anywho, i'll be writing in you after my holiday!   ciiaoo!  .chels.

      today wasnt so hot, in fact it was pretty cold, and rainy. i was late for a baseball meeting and i think i made mr.v mad, because he said "chelsea, you're 10 minutes late! i hope i didnt make the wrong decision!" yeah so i think i made him mad 3 times today. that was the first time, the second time was when shauna, sarah zo and i werent ready to present science, but we did and it STUNK!! like it really sucked, we're going to get BAAAD! So that was 2nd time. and then..for the 3rd time...he told me how i shouldnt have left the school property at lunch tuesday without permission because he could get in HUGE trouble!!! so i dont know how that went, and tomorrow i havea huge math exam. it doesnt count, but the smartest girl in the other class said it was super hard. so isnt that just stellar! okay im so slacking this term, id be VERY suprised if i got an 80 average. i still hope i graduate with honours though...ahhh! i cant wait for school to be OVER!!! next week is Ottawa, i hope its fun...although msot schools get to go to freakin QUEBEC! which is probably loads better. dah well what can you do. my eye is messed up. i realized it was sort of hurting yesterday, and i woke up this morning and my flippin eyelid was swollen! it was sick! i dont know whats wrong with it. zohal thinks that a fly flew up in there and now its laying eggs. ICK! yep and my ankle is hurting again..im such a wrek, and a complainer but i cant help it everything is wrong with me ha ha. well i should go. toodles!

      this blog is dedicated to em. because she is so cool.  Dont you just love how emily is attracted to like any man over the age of 50?? i mean, for example, my unlce, my grandpa, richard gere and english men from love actually. does anyone else find this remotely disturbing?   Also, how she just lets them go (fluffs..) anytime any place. Does she not have  any  decencey? And to boot they smell. bad.  She also loves to try to be gangster. its so funny.  -"I'll bring tha alco!!" emily -"What's alco??"me -"haha, i'll bring tha holo!!"emily  OR how she is SOOO mean! i mean, sometimes shes mean secretly, other times shes just flat out mean to your face. like tonight, when she made fun of this band and the lead singers screaming. of course, she does an impression, and at that very moment the auditorium becomes silent and EVERYONE heard her. I  sure bet  she felt  STUPID !  Or when she makes fun of how stupid i am. and how she makes fun of everything i say..like when i sound like a valley girl without meaning to. then i pretend i meant to. and my singing...oh man she makes fun of my singing so badly.   Ha or when she talks in her mentally challenged voice. i laugh so hard, it gets me everytime she says my name. "CHEESSSEAAA!!!! LET ME OUT OF THE CLOSET!!"

      im trying so hard right now not to feel regret. im trying so hard to  keep my head held high with confidence. im trying to stick by my decision and know it was right. its hard, and im trying.  its 7:51 a.m., which unfortunately means i must be heading off to school in about 10 minutes. i dont want to go. i dont want to sit in class and attempt to listen and try to do work. i just want to lie in bed and sleep! whoever invented sleep is genius but whoever invented school hours, sucks! my mom woke me up at 7:06 a.m. in a hurry, but i decided to keep sleeping and let my alarm wake me up. and it did, but for some reason the damn radio station wasnt coming in right, so it was this mega LOUD fuzzyish sound and ahh! it wasn't pleasant. then i made myself two packages of maple and brownsugar oatmeal and i hardly ate any of it. then i got dressed and ready and stuff. and i was done early. today is going to be a boring day..this whole week will. its going to be  long  and  boring , but i'll try to drag myself through it. i guess i should probably get off now and pack up. ciao...

      well, im back to the mixed feelings thing. its worse now than ever. its so bad i cant even explain it to myself? i just realized that i can be so dramatic!!! i always focus myself on all the bad things that make me mad or whatever in my life! barely spend any time on the good!! im going to try to stay off the topic on how confused i am and how perplexing life is. i got this feeling tonight..like, i started to realize how important my friends were to me. like my last entry i guess..but honestly i cant even imagine life without them...ahh its the worst thought in the world. but isnt it funny how the things/people you love the most, cause the worst pain in your life? but its like even if you have to endure bad pain, its worth it because of all the happy memories you've had. ah anywho its too late for this. i'll talk to you later.! CIAO!

       " Always look at what you have left. Never look at what you have lost."   what does this quote mean exactly? to never take advantage of what we got? cause i mean, face it guys..no matter how bad it is, it could be worse. and there are always things in life that keep you going...love/friendship, right? i mean, honestly, i couldn't live without my friends. today we did speeches about life lessons we learned. many of the lessons were to not take advantage of what you have, because it could be gone in a blink. this made me think a lot. if i could, i would go to everyone i love and care about and say it to them. ha, but that would be weird. but for the record, i really love all my friends.   Emily- you dont know how much you keep me going. our daily chats on MSN, to our weekly hangouts of pure talking. you give me the best advice...you're happy for me when things are good, you are sad with me when things are bad. you lift my spirits high and give me hope that things will be better. you compliment me when im down, as well as you try to make me laugh. we can be soo serious with eachother which is really good, but we can be stupid freaks, like in my basement. haha good times. i wanted to let you know i love you for that.  Zoe- lol we're like sisters we're so close. we could talk about anything without feeling embarassed. thanks for all the times you've helped me when i felt like giving up, and thanks for the 2 hour talks on the phone. thanks for all the gossiping moments lol and letting my spill my feelings. thanks for being there for me regularly, thanks for caring. i love you!!  Katie- you're my sister, friend and cousin all at once. you're always soo happy for me when things go good. i have so much fun with you, you never let me be sad. you'll just be your goofy self and make me laugh because you're stupid :o). haha jokes! you write me notes to see how im doing, and you're always there. you're again sad when im sad and happy when im happy. we feel eachothers emotions. although sometimes i may seem like your mother more than your cousin, you know i love with every inch of my heart and i always will!  Shauna- i know sometimes we dont get along, but sometimes (most of the time) we are just so close and have so much fun together. we laugh until we feel like we have abs of steel, and on the occassion we pee we laugh soo hard! lol but we have so much in common. we're both stubborn, which most of the time ignites our arguements. but i think we learn from them, even if they are stupid most of the time. im glad we met and become close over the summer! i love you!!  Sarah- we've known eachother for a long time. we can go from talking seriously to just being hyper and stupid and having a fun time. i think we've learned a lot from eachother from our thoughts and opinions because we both know we have lots of those. at times we can be completely oposite, but that may have even brought us closer. you care so much about problems i may have and you are always willing to listen. i thank you for that...i love you tons!    anyone else i didnt mention, i love you too!!!

      heylo! today was a boring day. holy man..i hate school so much, i cant wait until summer. tonight i can actually play soccer, im excited because i havent played in like a year! i hope i play good! lol well anywho.. yeah i havent much to say about my day, and i dont have any thoughts. so ciao!    Angel    Spend all your time waiting for that second chance for a break that would make it okay there's always one reason to feel not good enough and it's hard at the end of the day I need some distraction oh beautiful release memory seeps from my veins let me be empty and weightless and maybe I'll find some peace tonight  in the arms of an angel fly away from here from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you fear you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort there  so tired of the straight line and everywhere you turn there's vultures and thieves at your back and the storm keeps on twisting you keep on building the lie that you make up for all that you lack it don't make no difference escaping one last time it's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees  in the arms of an angel fly away from here from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you fear you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort there you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort here

      another thought..  does it ever occur to you, when you put your trust in someone that they are going to completely break it? how many broken promises does it take for one to realize it isnt worth it? or...to stop putting trust in them? when you're a push over, and when you're a very trusting person, you're munipulated easily. some munipulated in things like..drugs..sex..etc..others, its just being human and trying to be able to give your heart and feelings to another human. is that so wrong? it shouldn't be. like other issues..why should racism be one? can people not just realize we're all people? we're all here to live and die. so it should be natural that we all get along. it should be natural to be able to trust another without worry. too bad life isnt like that.  ciao!

      it was a long day, long indeed. we had city track. whoo i didnt even get to do anything..it was so long and boring! but oh well...yeah so that was my day.   "Kiss Me Fool"    Tell me who should I be to make you love me? Tell me what does it mean to be alone? Can't you see me standing staring out from the distance, hear my cry if you'd only listen... Out of focus, into me and you  Kiss me fool, if you care If your words have any meaning. Playing it cool is so unfair Why this veil of secrecy? God forbid, your friends found out what we did Why can't someone like you be someone like me?  Tell me who should I be to make you love me? Tell me what does it mean to be alone? Can't you see me standing staring out from the distance, hear my cry if you'd only listen... Out of focus, into me and you  Touch me fool, if your allowed. I'll be dancing in the corner It's so cruel to play it proud, take your hands and cover. I'm aware that all in love is fair, but that's no reason to make me feel this way.  Tell me who should I be to make you love me? Tell me what does it mean to be alone? Can't you see me standing staring out from the distance, hear my cry if you'd only listen... Out of focus, into me and you  And it hurts me so bad to deny it, oooh these feelings are out of control. Do you know what it's like to want something so bad... and then having to let it go? And it hurts me to know that this time in our lives... so soon will be in the past and you spend it pretending your playing it cool. Never knowing, never knowing, never knowing what, what we should've been.

(august 31st..yes, then im finally 14! haha). and then school starts. which im nervous/excited for. who knows what its going to be like, but i hope good!    &nbsp;  well..i better go. talk to you later..    &nbsp;  ...chelllllllls    &nbsp;  p.s. this is my first time using colour. im amused. can you tell?    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

        my worst pains are words i cannot say     the complete truth. but sometimes you have to let things go for the better of not yourself, but people around you and people you love. its an act of selflessness, and although it may hurt you in the long run deep down it feels good to have sacrificed something so your loved one didnt get hurt.

      allo.  yesterday i hung out with em and josh. haha it was a crazy experience, both know why...i wont say much else. only that, im glad it happened because i learned a lot. a lot a lot!  today i went to wonderland with jenn and taylin for jenns birthday. we had fun, and got soaked like 5 times. it was H-O-T. yes yes it was.   now im waiting anxiously to talk to people and see how they are doing...but im failing. and im a little p.o-ed at a comment i found on someones website but i'll deal with that later...psht.   tomorrow zo is hanging with me for the day and we're going back to her house for a s.o... its good because im going to PEI [with EM!!] and i wont see her for a bit so. i think PEI will be a bit of a getaway for me. possibly em too, i dont know maybe i should speak for myself. but i look at it as being like sleep. no worries, no cares. just being free and lazy and relaxing and not worrying about retarded teen problems. ahh..soo looking forward to it.  not much else needs to be said i suppose. i dont have any issues that are eating away at me at the moment. i have some little, tiny,   biting   problems but theyre bothering me piece by piece. eventually they'll die down...i hope.   It has been said that somthing as small as the flutter of a butterfly's wing can ultimately cause a typhoon halfway around the world.

      well im out of ideas now so im just going to name off some topics and talk about them. alright.   well i think friends are good? i mean i have a select few i actually talk to, and enjoy hanging out with.... its sort of sad to think. like i consider SOO many people friends..but..then whats a friend?     Friend  ;A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.  wow!! thats crazy. i trust few people in this world. its a funny thought actually, you should really be carefull who you call a friend. i guess, there are your friends. your close friends. your bestfriends. and your real friends. hm..i'll keep that in mind.  i was reading someone elses blog when i got the idea..why not come clean on some things ive done bad in the past?  well, people are always reassuring me that im a great friend and blah blah. and i appreciate it and on the occasion i believe it. but really we're all just hypocrits. we all lie. we all gossip. we all make mistakes. its a way of living and if we didnt do those things we wouldnt learn. i know ive gone behind my friends back before, in fact endless times. i know ive bad mouthed, i know ive lied, and i know ive broken trust. i know i have done these things and i know people do it to me everyday. what can you do to change that? absolutely nothing. there will never be trust in this world because in the end the only person you can trust is yourself.  frik i dont know where i was leading to with that one. wow my brain thinks faster than i type.  is honesty   always   the best policy in a relationship? because the truth hurts right. you dont want to hurt loved ones so why do we tell the truth then? because if we dont we go crazy inside with guilt? then wouldnt that make us selfish, because we have to let out some lie thats making us feel guilty and to relieve that we hurt someone else.    [[That is soo tru...i mean...people today in the world are fightin becuz they are a different colour or they speak differnet languages. I think it is time they look around them and tell us what the big difference is that causes death and hatred! We are all the same on the inside...do we not each have a heart? or a brain? What is it that some people lack that makes others want to kill? I for one am so sick of racism and its results....! I think that the Lion King is a wonderful story that portrays that real meanin of life which is basically just ot be part of the CIRLCLE OF LIFE!]]   props to zo on that one. but seriously! why do we fight about the most insignificant things like religion and race and culture. people take those things too seriously. i mean we're all here to live, love, and die. if you're going to have a problem with someone, dont have it because of something they cant control. or something so innocent like religion culture and race.     what the hell is wrong with me? lol im so all over the place. disregard all of that above unless it  ACTUALLY  makes sense to you. haha let me know.  .chels.

       movies have the best quotes.    "When you fall in love, it is a temporary madness. It erupts like an earthquake, and then it subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots are become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part." -captain corellis mandolin   "if you never take it seriously, then you never get hurt. if you never get hurt then you always have fun, and if you ever get lonely you can just go to the record store and visit your friends"-almost famous  "I don't scratch my head unless it itches and I don't dance unless I hear some music. I will not be intimidated. That's just the way it is"-remember the titans  "Crazy isn't being broken or swallowing a dark secret. It's you or me amplified. If you ever told a lie and enjoyed it. If you ever wished you could be a child forever"- girl interupted   anyway im tired of looking for quotes now. haha i suck. and im also a loser because its 1:23 a.m. and im sitting on the computer when is hould be sound asleep.   for the record...   remember the titans   and   the notebook are   the  WICKEDEST  movies ever. 10/10 for both of them. i suggest you see BOTH!  .chels.

      well, last night zo and i talked and tlaked about things and it really helped because we both got out some inner emotions. zo wrote about it in her blog so, im just going to paste it in mine because there would be no point in re-writing it all.   [[Last nite i was at my aunts and suddenly i had the urge to speak to someone about how i rele feel! U kno how sometimes u try to block all ur emotions in the back of ur heart and then it gets to a point where ur like,....if i don't let all this out then...i'm gonna BLOW! Well that exactly how i felt....so i did the most logical thing...and called Chels! I knew that she would understand. And i'm so glad i did! We talked for like an hour and then my uncle ordered pizza and then i called her back cuz i said i woudl and we talked for like another hour!   It was great...we talked about how soemtimes people put u down and they don'T realize that the things that they say rele affect u and hurt u. I mean i'm sure that their intention weren't for that to happen but the reality is that the truth hurts! Adults can be so cruel sometimes! Its crazy! They don't know that the things that they say affect us the most because we have been brought up in a world where we are supposed to believe that adults know best! They don't understand that the littlest things they say...we take to heart! I've had my share of disappointments and now my best friend if going through it!?! It just sometimes doesn'T seen fair...like...i mean..why do they always have to be so negative...! I know personally that my family seems to think that when the say negative things...it encourages the kid to get better! WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG! I can'T tell u how wrong that it! i mean..the only thing that will do is just male them feel like ....SHIT and they will give up trying because it seems like anything they do is not good enough! Whatever!  THen we talked about our friends! We both agree that sometimes we hate our friends because of the things they do and the things they say...and how they act so differnt around different people! But we also agree that we rele do love our friends...i mean...i kno that deep down they rele do care for us..even tho they have a rele bad way of showing it!   We talked about goin to highschool..and how we rele hope that we stay in touch with some of our friends but not so much others! I'm not mentioning names or n ething....but one thing i will say..u have to put the freakin effort to be a good friend° If ur not even trying to be my friend then u mite as well say buh bye to our frinedship!]]    sometimes it honestly is the best thing to do. just let it all out. it seems when you keep things inside, you're emotions all jumble up into one ball sitting in your stomach.  about the whole putting down thing. you know, ive been a person who honestly usually doesnt let people get me down. ever. but sometimes, its like words truely weigh you down. and if theyre coming at you all at once...they're going to put big weights on your shoulders and you're going to break down.   off that topic..wanna hear my dream? okay here it is.  we all were coming back from some kind of trip, maybe it was Ottawa or something, all the grade eights were. when we got off the bus, everyone's entire family was there all dressed in suits and ties and dresses etc. and everyone kept hugging everyone liek REALLY tight and lifting them up high and stuff! and i remember people kept wanting to get pictures with eachother and all these formal family pictures (this is all taking place at the school). then i looked at my mom and she was pregnant...and it was then i realized..she was like carrying my baby while i was in Ottawa, but it has to transfer back into my body now that i was home. and then i realized how young i was...nad that i was going to have a baby in  about a month. and i started BAWLING and screaming "NOO! i dont want a BABY!!!" and then miss lowry was there, and she started saying how i shouldnt have made the decision that i did. and i was sooo upset....after a while, i went to hug some guy good bye (i couldnt see the face in my dream..) and then he hugged me SOO hard and lifted me soo high we almost fell over until my dad yelled at him to stop. then my mom and i walked home, and we saw cracks in our house..when we got inside there were sleepingbags set up on the floor, and my brother was getting ready to sleep. then i woke up! yup, it was retarded.  anywho..today, i dunno what im doing, hopefully zo might be coming over...then tonight im most likely going to austins house with a bunch of people! so have a nice day! ciao!  .chels.

"Tuesday Morning" by michelle branch  I remember stormy weather The way the sky looks when it's cold And you were with me Content with walking So unaware of the world  Please don't drive me home tonight 'Cause I dont wanna feel alone Please don't drive me home tonight 'Cause I don't wanna go Tuesday morning In the dark I was finding out Who you are  I took your picture While you were sleeping And then I paced around the room If I had known then That these things happen Would they have happened with you?  Please don't drive me home tonight 'Cause I dont wanna feel alone Please don't drive me home tonight 'Cause I don't wanna go Tuesday morning In the dark I was finding out Who I was  And if you turned around to see me and I was gone You should have looked outside your window 'Cause the sun was coming up The sun was coming up  Please don't drive me home tonight 'Cause I dont wanna feel alone Tuesday morning In the dark We were finding out Who we are Tuesday morning In the dark We were finding out Who we are
