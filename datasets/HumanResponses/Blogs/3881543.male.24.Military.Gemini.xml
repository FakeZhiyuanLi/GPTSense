      This is the last post I'll will comment on this subject.   Mr. Anonymous:  First of all, never insult my wife again. Name calling is a clear indication of a lack of a real argument. It is immature and annoying. If you're so mature, act like it.   Second, the only difference between me and all the officers is two years of college. I have people telling me what to do who are younger than I am and have less than half my military experience (and some of them haven't even finished college). Hell, I'm being led in war by bank tellers and pig farmers. No, I do not think that my officers' "sacrifices" are an excuse for them to treat us "uneducated" folk like trash.   Third, I did not ask to do this job. I did not join the National Guard to go invade countries. If I wanted to do that, I would have stayed in active duty. I DO feel obligated to do this job because 1) I signed a contract, and 2) there's obviously not enough "Patriotic Americans" willing to do it. And just in case you're wondering, yes, I'm a damn good worker, so good, in fact, that my bosses went to great lenghts to help me get citizenship just so I could keep working where I am. I have earned the right to complain after I've given these people four excellent years of work and all I've gotten back is a fake promotion.   Oh yeah, and this job does not disgust me, it's just the people who seemed to have forgotten why we're here. If they ever knew.    I'm done.   In other, sadder news, a member of the 1/150th Armor Battalion was killed by an Improvised Explosive Device in the town of Balad Ruz, about an hour away from here, two days ago. This kind of news makes us very sad here, because he was in our brigade. He is only the 2nd person we've lost so far.   Good news? We know which unit is replacing us now, and have an approximation as to when they'll be getting here. We have officially reached the half-way point of this deployment, and we're starting to make plans to go back home. How exciting.   OH wow. I'm watching Bill O'Reilly yelling a Peter Jennings. I wish I knew what they're saying.

      I gather that I've managed to upset some people. I don't know who it was, since they won't write me, but my commment about the Army being a bunch of self-centered good for nothings seems to have done it. Well. I think I've earned the right to call the people who I work with what I really think they are. I hear all these people saying that we're in Iraq to "protect our rights" and that includes the right to free speech. So let me have my say. Your (whoever you might be) are also free to say whatever you want about me, but tell  me , don't go around insulting my wife.   Yes, my "buddies" know what I think of the Army in general. Of course, my "buddies" are only so because they think the same way I do. Just because most soldiers don't speak their mind doesn't mean that they're all mindless slaves. We don't all agree with this war, but we are here. Where are you?  I said soldiers are self centered. This is not something I'm saying out of anger or frustration. There's a whole rationale behind it. Americans are ethnocentric. That's not an insult, not a put-down, just a fact. You'd be hard pressed to find a nation which is as patriotic as the United States (one that's not under a Communist regime or a dictatorship anyway...), and part of it is probably the fact that the United States is a wolrd power, and every body wants to feel like they're part of this globally-influential nation. Can't blame them, who doesn't want to be powerful? However, all this seems to go to some people's heads, to the point where they actually think that they are better than others. Soldiers are a good example. For the most part, the attitude among my "co-workers" is that Iraqis are stupid because they don't speak english, and that they (Arabs) all want to kill us, so they should all be killed. I am not making this up. These are things I hear almost daily here.   So am I less patriotic for not believing Iraqis are inferior to us? Is it wrong for me to defend them and put down the real heroes, the soldiers who every day go out there and threaten and steal from Iraqis? Or torture and kill them?   This war has been a real moral conflict for me. I was hoping that coming here and seeing Iraq become a better place would at least make me feel like we're here for a good reason. But I haven't seen it yet. The Arabs and Kurds are out there killing each other every day, and we're just sitting here, watching. We don't care because they're not attacking us.   But the sad part is that even when they  do  attacks us, we still do nothing. That's where the good-for-nothing part comes in. If I may, I'd like to direct your attention towards my entry from ......  If we cannot trust our leaders to ensure our safety, who can we trust?   I wish I could be an officer. They are, by far, the happiest people in this base. That is why the news never hear the bad side of things, because they're always interviewing officers, and the ones I work with, have nothing to complain about. What am I talking about? I thought you'd never ask. For starters, the average officer makes 2-3 times more money than I do. They live with only 1 or 2 people per room (where as enlisted have 4-6 people in rooms the same size); Two of them took a projector which belongs to the battalion (it was supposed to be used to set up a small "movie theater" for the troops to watch movies) and they have it in their room to watch movies on. When it became apparent that officers would be towards the bottom of the R&R leave list, they changed the rules and made up a "lottery" where everybody's names would be thrown in a hat and drawn at random. Forget all that stupid Army stuff where lowest ranking people get to go first. So now we have captains and majors going before E4's and E5's. Yes, my CO went on leave before me. As a matter of fact, he was the second one to go on leave.     Need I continue? I won't. I just want to thank everyone out there who supports the soldiers, even those like me who swim against the current. Remember: not supporting the government is not the same as not supporting the troops. And disagreeing with Mr. Bush is not unpatriotic.   But does it really take a Colombian to tell you that? ;)

      for the first time in a long time, I really am truly joyous. I found out that I will go on leave soon, much sooner than expected. Of course, for OPSEC reasons, I will not but the date on here. But the whole day was a giddy blur of joy. I can't express the happiness I'm feeling without not making any sense.   I am working on a little illustrated poem for my boss, but I need to get some pictures uploaded first. Oh well.   For now, here's the answer to yesterday's trivia question: TYPEWRITER  Thank you, Trivia Bitch, aka my WIFE. :D  Oh wait...    urlLink  "BERLIN (Reuters) - A German firm has begun offering sunglasses and prescription spectacles with detachable frame arms that double as chopsticks or forks."    They're called "Sushi Specs" and, oddly enough, have been a particular hit in Japan... I'll just never figure some people out. We'll buy anything these days, won't we?

      Oh, I don't know, it's been a boring day. Days off in Iraq are over rated. Sheila introduced me to a wonderful website,  urlLink  www.jibjab.com   and I can't stop watching it. It's the funniest thing I've seen in a while.   In other news, here's what my research into my current state of mind has revealed:   Boredom, or ennui (a French word, from Old French enui) is a reactive state to wearingly dull, repetitive, or tedious stimuli: suffering from a lack of interesting things to see, hear, etc., or do (physically or intellectually), while not in the mood of "doing nothing". Temporarily being in a situation of boredom may also be felt as a waste of time, but then it is usually considered worse than just that. Alternatively one may have the feeling that boredom is caused by having too much time. Boredom can also be a symptom of clinical depression.  Boredom may also lead to impulsive, and sometimes excessive, actions, that serve no purpose and are damaging to one's self-interest. For example, studies in behavioral finance have shown that stock traders can enter into "overtrading", which is buying or selling even when there is no objective reason to do it, just because they feel bored when there is nothing worth doing.     urlLink  www.wikipedia.com    And the word  boring  in other exciting languages:  -aborrecedor (Portuguese) -barbant (French) -landweiling (German) -agasant (Romanian) -nudny (Polish) -dosadan (Croatian) -uggioso (Italian) -långtråkig (Svedish) -kjedelig (Norwegian) -aburrido (Spanish) -tính từ (Vietnamese)  Yeah, I don't know about the pronounciation, but this sure killed a lot of time.   OH! And a trivia question courtesy of the "Trivia Bitch" from The Juggling Gypsy, Wilmington, NC:   "What is the longest English word you can spell using only the top row of keys on a keyboard (QWERTYUIOP)?"  Answer will be posted some other time. I have to go now.

      So I've sent my  urlLink  little article   from yesterday to a few people, inlcuding  urlLink   Michael Moore  . Maybe someone will actually give a damn about it.   Sheila was sickened yesterday when I told her the story in my article. I, too had been feeling quite shitty all day. I can't believe that these stupid redneck fuckers would actually brag about catching the Iraqis trying to take food with them. We throw away hundreds of servings of food every day here, but we can't give it to the locals. I, personally, hate throwing food away, first because it's fucking expensive, and second because there's so many people in the world who don't get to eat as regularly as we do. Yet, here, we're actually threatening people's jobs for trying to smuggle fucking muffins and cereal out of the base.   From now on I'm going to be on the lookout for people saying bad stuff about Iraqis, such as "we should just kill them all" (which I hear all the time) and try to get it on the news somewhere. I mean, we're supposed to be here to help the people, aren't we? At least that's what Bush says we're doing here. But instead, we're just cowering in our base, waiting for someone to attacks us; coincidentaly, the people who attack us, are the same people who harass the peaceful pro-coalition locals. And then, we talk about killing them all, make appointments with them which we don't keep, make promises which are broken, and all this is supposed to be helping Iraq, somehow. I just don't see it.   Just what are we doing here?  In other news, it looks like  urlLink  fear   is spreading world wide.

      I must say, I'm extremely pissed today. I am mad enough that I wrote a  urlLink  whole article   about it.  I said it once, and I'll say it again, the US Army are a bunch of self-centered good-for-nothings. Oh yeah, I'm one of them.

      My life was looking up a couple of days ago, and then yesterday happened. It was one fucked up day from begining to end. Here's what I was going to post but never got a chance:     And just like that, I lost all inspiration. I had all these ideas for today's blog, but they're all gone, and I'm left with a sense of... incompletion. I feel empty inside, I feel detached from my own life. That's a common feeling here in Iraq though, where I have to be away from my wife, my life.   Every day I have to find a reason not to go postal here, and every day it's a struggle. And it gets harder to tell myself "this, too, shall pass." Of course, the access to the internet and all that makes it a lot better. But hell, we could be living in palaces.   Today three people leave to go on leave to the States for two weeks. I am next on the list, but it'll probably be two to four weeks before I go. While the thought of home is somewhat comforting, the wait is excruciating. I've all these things I want to do all lined up, and that thought kept me going for a while, but now, all I want to do is grab my wife and hug her for two weeks. How I miss you Sheila!  For some reason today I've been particularly lonely. We're in the process to move our "office" to a new building, and, even though there's no electricity or anything there yet, they've already started to move desks and stuff. The building isn't even wired for electricity yet.   And see, we can't run without electricity. We have 9 computers, 3 inkjet printers, 1 laser printer, 1 color laser printer, a huge multi-thousand dollar plasma screen, a 36-inch TV (with the only satellite in easter Iraq that receives FOX news), a projector, a "plotter" (Which is a printer that prints off of a paper roll 42-in wide), not to mention copiers, a fridge, microwave, coffe pot... Makes me wonder how they fought wars back in WWII with a radio and a map. We're even trying to get rid of the maps we have. HA!  So that's where your tax dollars go, folks. They don't buy flashlights or even blankets for all the soldiers. They don't even give the soldiers good, real food. It goes to the battalion commander's expensive FOX-getting satellite, the projector which two captains stole and now have in their room to watch movies (when it was supposed to be for EVERYONE to watch movies on), the purchase of locally-manufactured goods which are being sold in the PX and are making the guy who runs the PX a fortune... Everywhere I look, I see corruption, and dammit, if I'm not in on it, I don't like it!  But all this rambling is just that, rambling. A letter has already been sent to Sen. Dole of NC addressing these and many other issues. Hopefully we'll hear back from her soon...     Things are looking up today. I hope.

      Yes, to conclude this "disappointment in the US" run I'm on, here's a couple of links:   urlLink  www.moveon.org    An interesting  urlLink  article on Bush  .  And the ever popular  urlLink  Michael Moore's Website  .   Oh yeah. This one's a bit radical for my taste, but it's still interesting.  urlLink  Adbusters  .

      Here is another little incident that made me question our intentions.   There is a certain group of people in Iraq who have been declared "hostile" by CENTCOM, and last we've heard, were to be engaged on sight. Well, three days ago some people came to the base to tell us that 14 people, who matched the description of this particular group, were gathering in the woodline near their town, doing I-don't-know-what. So we sent about 50 people (the town is about 45 minutes from here) and even sent up our crippled UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle). To our dismay, the 14 had disappeared by the time our people got there (even though our scouts had "eyes on" all along... I never figured that one out). So we get all demoralized, and bring our guys back home. Oh yeah, on the way back someone fell off the back of a truck and hurt his neck, but more about that in a minute.   The next day, after one of our convoys got hit with and IED (that's a roadside bomb, and it was in the same area where the 14 were spotted the night before) there was a report of where the 14 were that day... actually two different people told us where they were. But did we go look for them? No. We just ingnored it AGAIN. As far as we know, those people could be setting up bombs everywhere or recruiting more people into their evil army. But we're just sitting here, letting them.   So about the guy who got hurt... If we were knowingly sending our soldiers into harm's way (after all, we were going there with the intent to kill these people if in fact they were who we thought they were), why not have a damn MEDEVAC helicopter right here, waiting in case one of ours gets injured? I guess that's just too damn obvious. Instead, when the guy hurt his neck, they talked about sending someone all the way out there (45 minute drive) to see if it was necessary to have him evacuated. How much sense does that make? It's not like we're paying for the helicopter to come pick it up...   In the end, the guy was alright, he's stuck in LSA Anaconda with no weapon, bulletproof vest or even boots (they must have "forgotten" to drop those off when they took him to the hospital). But those 14 people are still out there somewhere, waiting for the right time...

      So yesterday afternoon a dude came up to the gate to tell us that he found three men setting up a mortar tube in his back yard, and when he went up to confront them, they beat him up. So he did the sensible thing and came to tell us. After all, who else are they going to fire mortars at, right? So what does the great leadership of FOB Cobra do? I wasn't there but I imagine it sounded something like this:  "Get what town he's from and tell him we'll check it out in the morning. I'm going home now"  It is not surprising that at 2115hrs (or 9:15pm) we got hit with 4 mortar rounds. Fortunately, they landed about 400m away from the front gate. However, This could all have been prevented.   But it gets better. This morning, when I came it, the whole story had changed. According to the "official" story, we told the guy we'd check out his back yard as soon as possible, and our patrol was "on their way out the gate" when we got hit. Of course, there's no mention of the four hour lapse between the initial report and the actual attack.   What does this all mean then? It is scary to think of all the stuff that goes unreported and ends up as a fatal incident.   And I'm still confused about  urlLink  this  . But It's almost like watching interpretative dances for haikus. Entertaining.

      Last night we had a huge operation here in Iraq, one that would have even put us on the news. But of course, nothing came of it. Maybe these people here mislead us on purpose to make us look dumb...   Well our good friend Stan Hopkins is back. A few months ago he was put on trial for threatening an officer and then writing the officer's name on a bullet. He was busted from E7 to E4, and was locked up in Kuwait for a month. There, he told us, he met the first two people who were convicted in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and had some interesting conversations with them. Unfortunately I didn't stay for the whole narrative because I find SPC Stan to be more than mildly annoying. But I can't believe they put him back in this unit after being degraded so.   I must regretfuly report that my guitar hasn't been touched in weeks. For one thing, my roommates are always in the room when I am, and they're always playing their music or playing their games. I really like it quiet when I play, if I can help it. I've also been wanting to record some stuff, but, again, I need it quiet. So sad. I'm worried about how much I'm going to suck when I get back home.   In other news, the new TOC is ready to be moved into, almost. All they need to do now is board the windows up so we can turn our lights on at night. Yeah, at night we can't have any "white lights" on outside. So All those windows that the Iraqi builders took so much pride in putting in, are just going to be boarded up or covered somehow.   I hate moving. I don't like moving my own house, much less the place where I work. And we've got so much shit! The only good thing that might come out of this is that I might get my own office. Well, not just me, but the four people I work with. Hopefully we will get one for ourselves, and then I'll be free to do as I please all day. The only downer is that we might not have the internet over there, it'll be a 10 minute walk to use it. Well, no, that's not the only one. The walk from my room to the new TOC is twice as long as it is to the current TOC. Everything is farther. That's going to suck. Ugh.

      Call me a dork if you want to, but Star Control 2 is still the best game of all times. You might be wondering why this decade-old, DOS-based game is so great. Well, I don't know. It's just a very complex game for its time, I think, and it's really long, something I always like about games.   Unfortunately, Star Control 2 does not run on newer operating systems (such as XP), so I was kind of bummed out when I got my new laptop and the game didn't work on it. However, I recently stumbled upon a little website called  urlLink  The Ur-Quan Masters   where they are actually re-writing the whole thing so that it'll run on newer systems. They've renamed the game "The Ur-Quan Masters", something about the copyright. Isn't that great? And the best thing, it's free! So far they're still in the Alpha testing phase, they say there's a lot of bugs and stuff, but they're sorting it all out. I just downloaded the game this morning, and I can't wait to play it tonight (no, of course I haven't played it at work...!)   Also, someone even dorkier than me actually "remixed" all the songs in the game (which used to be really basic because they had to play through old computers' internal speakers) and the new ones are really awesome. They all have this techno beat which I love. Oh, they're  urlLink  here  .   Sad as though it might be, I spent over two hours of internet time to find this game and download it and stuff. But what else do I have to do here? Nothing.

      In this day and age it's very important to speak English. Especially if you're an Iraqi who's applying for a job as an interpreter at a US Army base. Seriously, people. We had a guy come here a couple of days ago saying that he wanted to be an interpreter, so my friend and co-worker interviewed him. He said the guy didn't speak a lick of English, just Kurdish and Farsi. C'mon.   From what I hear Kurdish and Farsi are very close, so all the Kurds that live around here can understand the Iranians who come across the border (both legally and illegally) pretty well. Kind of like Spanish and Portuguese, I suppose.   We hire a lot of interpreters here who only speak Kurdish. I don't think that's very smart, seeing how a large majority of the inhabitants of this area are still Arabs. There's a lot of thigs around here which make no sense. Here's another one: Locals come up to the base all the time, asking to speak to some captain or another for a wide range of reasons, anything from their brother being detained by the IP (Iraqi Police) to wanting to get a bid on a contract (usually for construction) somewhere. Some of them have appointments, some of them don't. Well, the ones who don't have appointments, are usually sent on their way. I understand that, to a certain extent. However, whenever these captains don't feel like talking to someone, they just tell them to go away, usually without even an explanation other than "I don't feel like talking to any Iraqis today" (of course they mostly use other, stronger words for 'Iraqi'). What is that? And we wonder why all these people are getting increasingly angry at us. WE DON'T WANT TO HELP THEM.    It feels even worse to be the little guy out there at the gate who has to tell the pissed off Iraqi people to go away because no one wants to talk to them. I've been there.   I have also been in the meetings the officers have. They really treat us "enlisted" members (that is, everyone who's not an officer, i.e. privates, sergeants) like we don't matter. An example. Most of us here at FOB Cobra live in "Containerized Housing Units", which are basically big metal boxes with windows and a door (and A/C and electricity, of course). Some unlucky souls live in tents, and it was a big deal because it wasn't fair. The tents have no A/C or anything. So what was the officers' solution? Put all the enlisted members in tents. That was their actual answer. Nobody said anything about rearranging the officers (they all have 1 or 2 people to each room; each room is designed for 4 people). Fortunately, this didn't happen and how we should have enough CHUs for everyone, but just the fact they someone actually suggested that... And all this goes on behind closed doors, so the average Joe doesn't ever hear about. It's sad.

      I've always been fascinated by AI (Artificial Intelligence), and so I looked it up, right, I mean, what else do I have to do on the internet in the middle of the Iraqi day... So the first website I went to, it seems, is pretty official. Well, with an address like  urlLink www.a-i.com  who's surprised? Anyway, on that website you can talk to these "chatbots",  urlLink Hal and Alan  and Hal has different personalities. It's neat.   There's a movie coming out called "I, robot" with Will Smith, which, as I thought, is partialy (or loosely) based on the book  urlLink  I, robot   by Isaac Asimov. I read this book back in High School and thought it was interesting but didn't really get into it. I did, however like the whole idea of it, which is, basically, the ethics of robotics. In  I, robot  Asimov outlined the three laws of robotics:   "One, a robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm;  Two, a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law;  Three, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.   I still think that I'd like to work with robots when I grow up (ha!), even though I'm having second thoughts about majoring in computers, every time I hear something or see something about robots I'm like 'WHOA!', so there is still something there, I think. All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.   In conclusion, robots are cool. check out  urlLink  Asimo  . There's that little one that dances and surfs but I can't find him!!  Olright, I better get back to work.

      So&nbsp;yesterday morning (the&nbsp;night before in the States) I had about a half-hour conversation with my wife before I came in to work. At first she said she was high, and I was about to get mad when she explained that she took two sleeping pills instead of just one, and now she was all high. We talked, as I said, for about 30 minutes, and finally I had to go to work and she had to go to bed. So we did, and I continued on with my boring-ass day. After work I got online, and got two off-line messages from Sheila, asking where I'd been and why I didn't get on before work like I said I would. She had no idea that we had talked. Isn't that crazy? I mean, I know it can happen, after all I've seen Total Recall and Paycheck and all those crazy movies, but it had never really happened to my wife! So that was interesting...   Reuters reported the following:     "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Science Museum says it is considering a radical way of paying its hefty energy bills -- using visitors' excrement.  The central London museum said it was considering taking the waste from its 14 toilet blocks and converting it into electricity.   "With free admission it would be a great way for visitors to give something back to the museum and help keep the overheads down," said the museum's head Jon Tucker. "We have almost 3 million visitors each year and have huge electricity bills."   The museum said the plan would be to siphon off waste from the toilets, store it and then either burn it as fuel in a mini-power station or turn it into electricity using a microbial fuel cell.   The power produced from the excrement of 100,000 visitors could produce enough to power 500 light bulbs, while also breaking down harmful organic matter, it said."      May I just say here that it's been my experience that burning shit sucks? Not to mention the stech. It's unlike anything I've ever experience. Yes, I had to do it here once, (we got rid of the "burn latrines", thank god (or Allah)), and it was a most unpleasant experience. I hope Britain's Science Museum has a plan to contain the smell of burning shit...   I really like watching the news at times. However, I must say that news in the US are mostly bad news. I never fully realized it until we got CNN international where I work for a little while. It then dawned on me that in the US they don't show international news at all. And also that almost the whole world has something bad to say about the US and that Americans don't like that. So we got rid of CNNi and paid a guy to come here all the way form across Iraq to install a whole new satellite system which recieved FOX news. It should come as not surprise that out of the 30 or so people I work with, there are only 2 democrats. I forgot what I was saying.   Well, the point I wanted to make is that the news lately have been so depressing, that I've not watched or read a news story in about a month. Yeah, we still have FOX news where I work, but most of the time the volume is turned down, so that's a relief. And, honestly, even though I've had my downs and ups, I feel so much better because I don't have to worry about the rest of the world... does that make sense? Anyway, I miss watching the cricket highlights...   Ok, I have to go.

      I had a terrible dream yesterday. We lived in a world ran by just a few powerful people, and these people kept the masses in constant fear by threatening with deadly and devastating attacks on their loved ones. Countries waged wars on each other under false pretenses, telling the people it was for their own protection when in fact it was just to give the rulers even more power and wealth.   And people believed blindly in their government, because they belived that their ruler was put up there by god himself, and that all his decisions were made in god's name. Those few who did not believe in the government were prosecuted and called lawless and godless.   But then I woke up in my cot in Iraq, and realized it had all been a bad dream. Or was it?  ***  I'm tired of talking shit. For once, I want everybody else to be happy, to enjoy their lives. So in that spirit, I give you this advice:                            STAY AWAY FROM THE MILITARY!!!   Reading is great, I think. And free books, even better.  urlLink   Project Gutenberg   is a great site, and I'd love to contribute, if I had the time and the patience. One day, maybe. There's also another site,  urlLink  www.blackmask.com  , which I just found out about last night. They also have some free books.   Here's another  urlLink  free book.  . That is the best book I've read since I got to Iraq, but I can't exactly say why.  urlLink  Jim Munroe    has another free book and some other free literature in his website. I think I'd mentioned it before, no?   And finally, isn't  urlLink  this   funny?  Sometimes I think that I want to become a linguist, since I'm so fascinated by (duh!) languages. I speak Spanish and English quite fluently, so by default I understand some Portuguese, Italian and I can read French pretty well. Also, given the part of the world I find myself in these days, I'm trying to learn some Arabic, which has proven to be a real challenge. I've learned some, though, some with the help of free internet courses, some more from the interpreters we employ here at FOB Cobra. I wonder if I can just study languages all my life and not have to work... I guess I'd have to win the lottery or something. Hmm...  Anyway, I'm hungry and my newly purchased Chips Ahoy! are calling. As well as a shower and clean clothes. That's a real luxury in these parts. Have I mentioned that Iraqis almost never change their clothes? And I'm afraid to ask because I don't know if it's because they can't afford them or because they just don't care. I think it's the former, though. It's very sad how some of these people live. More on that later, right now I have to go eat junk food.

      Yes, I said it. As much as I hate to admit it, I actually called FOB Cobra "home" the other day. In public! Everyone looked at me with that face that says "yes, we have been away that long too". I felt like I betrayed my real home.   So I'm back at Cobra, the trip here was short and uneventful, as we all knew it would be. I have a cool picture of Erb and I in front of a BTR-80, an old vehicle, I think it's Soviet made, something you don't see every day. Turns out there was a group of Bulgarian soldiers and they were driving around the base in their foreign vehicles, Very cool. Oh the pic is  urlLink  here  .   Back to work now. They were kind enough to give us an hour or so to unpack our stuff and put away all our groceries (one of the big attractions at other bases is their PX's, since ours SUCKS ASS), and now I have to go back and sit around for 6 more hours.   sigh

      Have you hugged your toilet today? Let me tell you, today was the first time I've used a realy toilet in about two months. Maybe longer than that. This morning I used one, and, folks, let me tell you, it's an experience which will not be easily forgotten. How lame is that?  So I took a shower last night, and that was also incredibly awesome. There was hot water and good pressure, and the lights were on (these all things we don't get at FOB Cobra), and it was just an overall pleasant experience. Then I slept in a non-air conditioned tent, and that wasn't so bad.   This morning I got up around 9 and went to look for the people from our unit who are coming back from their R&R leave in the States. This is their last stop before going back to Cobra. So I walked into the tent they're staying in, and they were all so happy, for some reason. I knew all of them, and Long, a guy I work with, was there with them. So I told them about all that's happened in the last month (that's how long they've been gone... almost) and they told me about the pains of going on leave. It took them 7 days to get from Cobra to the States. Ridiculous, isn't it?   After that we all went to the PX, Erb got a real Persian rug and sent it home, and we've pretty much done nothing all day. I took another shower in the afternoon, then took a nap, and when I woke up, everyone was asleep. Around 8pm Erb, Long and I all went to eat, and now we're here! It's great to not have a job in the military.   And tomorrow morning, back to reality... at least for another month or so, when I'll be going on leave myself. I can't wait.

      I try and I try and I can't seem to get pictures to work on here. What the hell is going on? If you want to look at all the pictures I have promised in previous posts but they don't show up on the blog, you can see them here:    urlLink http://www.geocities.com/gabecass7/blog/   Hopefully that will work. Ok. Bye

      I'm here on-location on a top-secret mission. Not really I'm at a different base tonight, the first time I've left my own base for more than a few hours at a time. I'm here until wednesday morning, and I have absolutely nothing to do, so it's pretty much time off, which I will enjoy thoroughly.   The only interesting thing that's happened is that Erb test fired the .50 caliber machine gun when we first left the base, and that thing's so loud... my ears are still ringing, almost 12 hours later. I don't see what else it could be from. But it's really uncomfortable and it's driving me nuts. Next time I'll have to be sure and wear ear plugs.   It's freaking 1:47am and Erb and I are just driving around the base. This place is huge. They have 4 mess halls, a computer tent with 40 computers, a real PX (post exchange... store) where you can buy freaking cars and motorcycles (as well as cookies and Cokes which have been sitting in the sun so long they're all bloated) and stuff. It's really interesting to see people other than the usual 800 I live with, and a lot of Air Force people too. And some Marines. People who live here have it made. They have freaking salsa lessons in one of the tents and stuff. We have nothing of the sort at FOB Cobra; we have computers and a TV that seldom works, and that's about the extent of our entertainment. Oh yeah, and 6 phones (for 800 people). It's like going to NYC after living in Beargrass, NC.   Alright, so I guess I'm going to go surf the internet now, I haven't had a chance yet. The damn computer I got earlier didn't have an address bar on IE, so I couldn't type in addresses... this day has been all sorts of screwed up. My wife didn't get all the text messages I sent her earlier, so she didn't know I was online. So I thought she was ignoring me for a while, but of course that was just me being homesick. It makes me sick that these people live here like this, and then they complain because there's no fucking ice cream at dinner.   I'm tired, and it shows, I think. Right then. Good night.

      First of all, I want to say that this morning I'm in a very good mood, and it's all thanks to my wife. We talked on the phone yesterday, for the first time in a long time, and that really lifted my spirits. We get to chat online a lot, but it's just not the same... I LOVE YOU SHEILA!  Some days are better than others. I'm mostly over my frustration at being "frocked". Some fun has come out of it, for some people. Jokes like "what the frock are you doing?" are becoming pretty common. Directed towards me, that is. Get the frock out of here, how the frock are you. I can see it getting old pretty soon. Fortunately it's only my friends who have been saying that stuff, so it's not so bad. I don't have a good picture of them, sadly. I'll have to work on that. I've taken almost 1000 pictures since I got here, and I barely have any of the people I work with.   I do, however have a picture of me at some ruins near the Iran/Iraq border:        Yeah, it's not all that great. I've seen pictures of some of the border crossings, and they're really nice, some of them have castles and whatnot. And the Iranians on the other side point weapons at US soldiers when they get too close to the fence. Of course I've never been there, so I wouldn't really know. See, I don't get to leave the base very often, so I haven't gotten to see a lot. I've seen Baghdad, and that was pretty impressive. Here is a picture I took when our convoy (coming from Kuwait to Iraq) was merging into traffic in western Baghdad.        On a separate note, I'd like to give my review of the last book I read. I picked it at random out of the bin of free books we have here (well not really at random... it was the only fiction I could find). So here it is:   urlLink Manta's Gift  By Timothy Zahn Rating: 8 out of 10 The book in three words: Original but predictable.  HAHA! You were expecting three adjectives. No?

      This  urlLink video  was made right here, at FOB Cobra, in the mess hall (that's where we eat, by the way). The old interpreter guy with the cool had is Adil, and he's really funny. There's other videos from this area there. Where was I when all this was being filmed?? sigh.

      I am fortunate enough to be in a safe area in Iraq. We receive reports every day about attacks on Coalition as well as Iraqi forces, and it just makes me appreciate my situation so much more.   We employ several locals who work for us as interpreters (22 of them, actually), and they're all great people. Most of them are Kurdish, and therefore more friendly towards the US than the Arabs in this area. This area, eastern Diyala Province, lies, as I understand it, right in between the green and brown lines, which designate the borders of the Kurdish and Arab influence, respectively. The brown line is where the green line used to be before Saddam pushed it north in his massive push to repress the Kurds.   Today, however, it's the Kurds who are trying to push the green line south. They set up illegal check points, fly the Kurdistan flag (which is not allowed because Kurdistan is not an officially recognized state, or country), and try to get into positions of power within the government. All this is causing a lot of strain in the area, and we're trying to play a part in stopping all this. Since sovereignty was handed over to the New Iraqi Government, a lot of these duties have been (thankfully) taken away from us and passed on to Iraqi authorities. Which means that our job is now limited to security, and, when needed, a certain measure of arbitration between the different parties that operate in the area.   Where do I fit in all of this? I pretty much take in all that's happening and disseminate the information. The ONLY thing I like about my job is that I am kept well informed about what's going on in most of Iraq, and therefore, when I leave, I will have a better understanding of what was done and what happened while I was here. Or at least that's what I'm hoping.   Since, like I've said before, not much happens in our area, my job consists mainly of, well, this:    urlLink     I have to say at this point that I strongly oppose the way the US is doing business here, specifically the little stuff, like the general management of the people and their issues. One example is weapons cards. EVERYBODY in Iraq seems to have one. But then, the US goes around and confiscates them all, and tells the people they need to get weapons cards. However, when they locals come back to the base to get their weapons back and to apply for weapons cards, we deny them both. We are lying to them and not making any attempt to hide it. And what's worse: The people who actually make these decision (like, "they're not getting their weapons back") are not the ones who have to talk to the locals; they send people like me to talk to them, so us, the little guys, have to send all these pissed off Iraqis off. It's such a cowardly way to function for such a mighty Army, I believe. But That's just me. Maybe they'll publicly flog me for these comments.   Here's a  urlLink little something  that keeps me entertained (at least 30 seconds at a time)

      Today was another wonderful day here in Iraq. Well, not really. Today I was taken advantage of, again. I have been "frocked" to the rank of Sergeant, which means that I get to wear the rank, but don't get the pay or anything else. So, basically, they're saying "shut up! we don't want you to ask when you're getting promoted any more!" Very disappointing, I must confess.   I would now like to turn your attention to one of my favorite websites,  urlLink Jim Munroe's . He writes books and things and makes small movies, and stuff like that. He's also a huge advocate of independent publishing, which is great. Lots to learn if you like to write.   Since I have only a limited time online each day, I have to cut it short. My lazy ass should write some while offline, but I just can't get myself to do it. Oh well. Maybe some other time.

        Hello. My name is Gabriel. This is the most awkward post, since I have to introduce myself and all that. I am in the North Carolina National Guard, currently deployed in Iraq. I'm in the eastern area of the country, where it's nice and quiet. This area is  mostly Kurdish, and the Kurs love the US, so we often get people come up to the base and bring us gifts, or food.   I guess the first thing I want to make clear is that I oppose this unlawful occupation of Iraq, and I'm trying very hard to make the best of the situation. I am married, it will be 9 months here in a few days, and we are very happy. Sheila, my wife, has been incredibly supportive (as I knew she would be), and she's done a great job keeping me sane in such an insane place as this.   We have been in Iraq for four months now, and things continue to get worse steadily. Don't get me wrong; we're in a very safe place, as I've said earlier, but the people in charge here are just making things difficult for the rest of us. But more about that later.   Since my hobbies include music, soccer, literature and computers, that's probably what this blog will be about (beside Iraq, that is). That said,  urlLink here is an article   I found which is pretty interesting   Open source software really does seem like a good option for a country on the rise such as Iraq. However, I can't help but think that with all that oil, cash should not be one of the country's main concerns...   Well, good bye for now.

      I've neglected by blog, and I feel bad. However, it's really hard to think about anything these days other than the inevitability of my going home. It's so close I can taste it!  The last few days have been frustrating, but not to the point of breaking my mood. I guess my main complaints are:  1. Republican comments on the DNC 2. Our bosses treating us like children 3. Having to work  That's it, really. Republicans really can't stand Kerry, but I don't imagine they would really like any candidate who spoke out against the war on Iraq. I have a theory about this, though. It applies to US soldiers in Iraq, and it goes like this:  The reason soldiers are so supportive of Bush is because they don't want to hear the truth about the war; they don't want someone telling them that they are here for no reason other than the advancement of, well Bush.   I caught myself daydreaming just a few minutes ago about home. Sheila bought a grill, and we've decided to have a cookout, and I was just imagining myself cooking burgers and hot dogs on our new grill. It was so much like what you'd see in a movie, it was funny. There, I was (I even had an apron on, which said "kiss the fool") flipping burgers and having a great time with a bunch of people dressed in hawaiian shirts...  If work keeps going the way it's been going, I will go insane. We are supposed to stay in a room all day, which is small and cramped and it has no sunlight coming in. I'm not supposed to move from my desk, no matter what, unless I'm relieved by someone. Well guess what. There's barely ever anyone here to relieve me. So I have to ask for permission to go to the bathroom, just like back in damn grade school, and I've gotten in trouble for leaving my desk (going to the bathroom, no less) and not having anyone replace me. These people are getting more anal every day, when I thought it would be the opposite. I'm surprised they allow us to walk to our rooms by ourselves...  I'm hungry. That's a bad thing when you can't eat at the desk you can't leave...
