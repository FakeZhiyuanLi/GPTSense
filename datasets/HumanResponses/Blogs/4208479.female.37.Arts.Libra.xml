        Web assessment tests. I have recently had to fill a few of these out for various jobs. They have statements that you need to AGREE to, DISAGREE to, STRONGLY AGREE to, etc. Statements like; "I find most people annoying" and "I think it's OK to give my friends unauthorized discounts." What the fuck. Who would answer these in any way except the "right" way? There was also a question like, "How much money have you stolen from employers in the last year? $0, $5-$10, $10-$20, etc..." It's more of a way to find out if you are rock-stupid, rather than a criminal.      rg

        But if you think you're free, try walking into a deli, and urinating on the cheese!      I read that "normal" people are doing so much to themselves now that they are becoming punk. This was in reference to girls with blond streaks in their hair. That's not punk. Maybe green, or purple or black or red streaks... but still, fashion is no indication of punkness. Duh. Girls with hair-streaks and tattoos and piercings are just that: girls. Only when you talk to them can you determine what their social and political affiliations are.       rg

       I can kick you way up into a tree.  I had an idea that I wanted to get some rain boots; the tall ones that go up to your knees. I figured I would have to get some ugly green ones from the Lillian vernon catalog or something, but that was OK since it would be kind of an original thing to wear. Now all of the teenybop fashion catalogs have knee-high rainboots for about $40. And yeah, they're really fucking cute. Then I decided I would get a poncho; I haven't had one since the third grade and they're kind of a cool alternative to jackets. But where to get one? Thrift store? Gramma's closet? Garage sale? Naw... all the teenybop catalogs have decided that ponchos are now cool too. Yay. If only I could have marketed these things ahead of the curve and made some serious coin.  Also I thought of these things before they came out; - fruit and vegetable wash - adjustable-length necklace - in-shower body lotion (like a creme rinse for your skin) - candy jewelry that was still cool to wear even after you ate the candy part  I believe I have rediscovered the precursor to Hanson. I love Hanson, and I used to love this band back when I was a kid. It's The Keane Brothers, people. So peep them and see what I mean.    urlLink  http://www.idv8.com/feelgroovy/l70s.html     rg

       font? ariel. size? small. san-serif? priceless.      The name "horrible rainbow" is from The Simpsons "Usurper" episode. Marge yells, "Stand back! I've got JIMMIES!!" and throws the toppings in the faces of the ice-cream parlor attendants who are trying to subdue her. One covers his eyes with his hands and screams, "Auuugh! All I can see is a HORRIBLE RAINBOW!!"      rg

       The banner on top of my blog page today was an opportunity to own a tea house franchise. Curious, said Alice.    Is there a reason why so many people are in credit card debt? Is it that people are just going around spending money on things they cannot afford and getting themselves into trouble, or is it that we have a whole society where the simplest of lifestyles costs way more than the average person's means? Having a house and 2 kids is an astronomical cost. Having a washing machine break down or a car go kaput or someone getting sick puts you in the position of having to use your credit card, and then if your company, like most companies nowadays, shows you no loyalty at all and just lets you go or allows you to stagnate in your dead-end position for years, you have no choice but to use credit to pay for the things you need, nevermind the things you want.      My friend Mike, who was my boss at the newspaper in 1993 once told me, "I don't want to just survive, I want to thrive." I used to think just surviving was enough. Like we are lucky to have what we have. I don't think wanting to thrive is very greedy anymore.    p.s. Vote for Mike for State Representative in PA. He's Irish!     urlLink  http://www.mikemcgann.org/       rg

       Someone said that to me once and I still don't know what it means.      I've seen a lot of things lately having to do with isolated communities. I watched Dances With Wolves, where the idea of a society removed from "civilization" first appealed to me. Then I saw The Village, and I thought how nice it would be to just have a few boys to choose from instead of a whole world of them. I also watch Amish in the City voraciously; and although the clothing and the Christian worship turns me off, the very idea of an 1800's village existing in today's society is rather interesting. Last night I saw Big Fish, and the town of Spectre was full of dancing shoeless people in pretty clothes and nice hair, and Steve Buscemi! That is where I want to live. Then today I watched Nell, that horrid movie with Jodie Foster and Liam Neeson and trees and her dead sister. She looked so clean. How did she look so clean, and have such shiny hair and white teeth? It's fun to imagine someone being all wild and wooly in the forest and living like some dreamy woodland nymph, swimming naked in the moonlight but come on, she would totally reek and have skanky teeth and her house would be full of bugs.   My house is full of bugs but I smell good and have nice teeth.      The outside world looks so garish and rude, and hard. And it really is. I don't much like it. It's too much work and very little reward.      rg

         I had to find the thorn from a white rose bush.   Often I dream about bathrooms. Finding them, using them, lack of privacy or lack of cleanliness. Last night's dream involved alligators, rabbits, pools of water and Tokyo. I said, "This is like being in a Dali painting!" as I swept towards the door in a torrent of waves. I grabbed Amanda from the water. The family was there and Stephanie's mom was opening a tea or coffee house, with biscotti and cakes. I didn't want to be in Tokyo. I think this is because I saw some of Lost in Translation on TV last night. Also because I considered briefly applying for a job as a barista in a retro coffee house, even though it would be a 45-minute drive, a $3.00 toll and I don't drink coffee.  Also I dreamed about making a movie where I, as an Enid Coleslaw-type character, went way back in time to 1984, when I graduated high school. In the dream this was a big time-leap. Did they even have cars then? All there was to do was go bowling.  rg
