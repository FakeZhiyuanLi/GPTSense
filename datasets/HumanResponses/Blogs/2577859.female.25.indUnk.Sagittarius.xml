      i was so bored at work, i imed Steve and waited for a while for his reply. it was quite sometime until i got a reply, and it was from tiffany, his wife. Oops. fortunately, i only asked him the name of the sushi place we went to when we were in the Bay Area. she replied, saying sorry, she 'intruded' my conversation with Steve. i have a feeling she's the guilt-driven type.  Well...  i'm going to my parent's tonight. my engagement party is just a day away, and there are so many things to do. it was supposed to be a simple, boring engagement party. but who knew that my aunts and cousins did all that for the preparation. my aunt, who lives 6 hours away, is taking the bus tonight to deliver me the dress my cousin wore at her engagement party. not that I mind, but i wasn't planning for it. it made me a little guilty knowing that I did nothing to prepare for the party. there's just no way for me to explain myself, but i'm just glad that everybody cared.  just a day away...

      i seem to have so much to say nowadays. probabily the urge came from reading all those interesting blogs of other people, who very much seems, frustrated, angry, happy, confused, all at the same time, and just need to channel out that energy somewhere.  anyhow. my colleagues and i went to the shopping mall for lunch today, and we stopped by the feng shui place right after. good god, there were a lot of people there. i've always thought that the business of making people believe they can make money is the best business. it's all bunch of mambo jambo, or even, it's plain common sense. i rather not get into the whole, if i put this little bambo tree in that particular corner, i'd become rich kinda mentality. but i got to admit, that black onyx bracelet has caught my eyes for quite sometime now. it's just a matter of time before i go ahead and get it.  boss is back from lunch. the more i look at his face, the more irritated i became. he's so loud and so obnoxious. i have seen it a couple of times where he would just throw it someone else's face on how 'stupid' he thinks other people are. and to think that other people in this company would acknowledge my colleagues and i are part of his team is a scary thought. he's so damn arrogant, i can't believe the management hasn't fired him yet.  oh... good news! H finally got that job at his brother's friends company, as an assistant manager of some sort. finally, he's out of the banking market, although i must say, it's quite a kick everytime i introduced him as a banker to my friends. now, it's just too weird to introduce him as an assistant manager in an oil an gas company. it's just too mouthful. i gotta figure out a better introduction. and with his new job, which he managed to get the offer changed from a contract position to a permanent position, is offering good enough money for a couple of years before i start popping out babies. babies... hmm... that's a different story altogether. we'll get into that later...

      i just did the most hypocritical thing in my whole life and i am ashamed of it.  you see. there's this new tv series on tv3 that will air soon, and they are trying to put front these young professionals to talk about themselves, their aspirations, dreams and such. and guess, who one of the candidates are? me... and as i was waiting uncomfortably in the waiting room, the lady who was in charge of all this mentioned that i should probabily say something about how this lousy company turned my life around, and how great it is to be onboard. i almost gagged...   and so, i did it. they had a 90 second shot of me, talking about bullcrap, about how i love to work here, and that this company is THE place to be. i feel so dirty just thinking about it. need a shower with apple cinnamon scrub right after work.  talking about that... H's mom, my mother in law to be, has invited me, again, to her house to spend the night. i don't know what it is about me, that intrigue her, or at least, her urge to ask me to spend the night, almost every weekend now at her place. my future brother in law is not going to be home, which makes it easier for me to say yes. it's just that, i wish, instead of being in the same room with her, i'd be across the room with H, doing you know what till the wee hours of the night. i haven't been with him for over 2 weeks now, and we've made plans to go at it tomorrow, after all the chores are over, or maybe even, early in the morning right after we got out of the house. but that would mean that we'd have to travel twice as much to get to my place, and then to klang. hmmm...

      seriously...  i miss my life in the states. but only the part where the weather is nice, the pay is good, the people are friendly, the food is yummy, and pretty much everything else. i was getting more than 3k a month, nett, in us dollars, and all i did over the weekend was shop, hang out at barnes and nobles, and find nice restaurants to eat.

      i have been looking like mad on the web for cheap designer items. my wedding is around the corner, and one of the things that i need to do is to get all these gifts or 'hantaran', as we Malays say it, for the groom and the bride. thing is, the groom, which soon will be my husband would settle for nothing less than designer labels. *sigh*  H and i have been debating over this, over and over again. i respect his opinions about this, and since he has lived with this ideology all his life, there is no point for me to change his mind. however, it's quite hard for me to get used to this idea of wearing designer labels. up until now, i have nothing of designer like, and as a woman, i am quite lacking in the area of pampering myself. actually, the most expensive thing i have bought for myself (cash, that is), is not a dress, or a pair of shoes, or a handbag, but a BICYCLE! i have talked 2 of my friends into buying a mountain bike, so they could go mountain biking with me. i mean, a normal gal would probabily spend her weekend buying shoes, and hanging with her gal friends having coffee. and then there's me, on my mountain bike, climbing hills, falling off my bike, and hurting myself on my head over the weekends.  but sometimes, i wish i had pampered myself more. buy myself nice pairs of shoes every weekend, wear nice clothes to work, do my hair every other weekend. so i guess, this short shopping spree will probabily be the beginning of it all. i'll be out with friends in my manolo blahnik heels, ferragamo handbag, burberry scarf, a nice fitting dolce and gabbana shirt and pleated skirt, looking out if escada is going on sale. ;)

      i am incredibly bored at work. i am so bored, i even have time to de-frag my hard disk. that is how bored i am. things are just not progressing at work. i suppose people are still in their holiday mood. half of the people are missing celebrating chinese new year. and what am i doing at work? i do not know...  i am in serious need of a new environment. my boss seems a little distant to me. i have no idea what he is thinking and what his plans are for us. i have a serious need to talk to him, about my future. that is, if he cares about my future. a good manager does, and i don't think he is one.  enough of the depressing stuff...

      the wedding preparation is driving me crazy. i can never seem to get what i wanted. my mom spends way too much on things and my wedding budget, if we can still call it a budget, has been overrun so many times, and now i'm spending $2500 more than what i should have spent.  urgh... i am so frustrated with the whole wedding and work thing. things have been happening at work, that i cannot comprehend. i'm stuck with this company which knows jack about employee's well-being. i might be paying the company back my money that i earn for the reason of not having enough job, which in the first place, the company should know well what kind of job to give. i'm beginning to really 'dislike' my boss for the fact that he does 'jack' in managing his people. and the only thing that keeps me motivated or going is that i get to spend my weekend with my loved ones, and thank god for that.  so, enough bitching around, and see what we can do to make this better. there are two ways to approach the whole wedding plan thing. either i control everything, or just say, whatever. i'm inclined to say 'whatever' right now, cuz, i just don't want to care anymore. all i know is, the wedding will turn out nice.  about the work thing, i'm seriously thinking of joining the police force. my mom and dad have been in the police force and they got compensated quite well for what they do, except for the fact that my parents never quite understand the idea of a career move. and as far as i know, the police force knows how to treat their employees well. compensate them well, give them benefits. but the thing is, it would be a complete waste of time for me to go to the states and studied engineering for 4 long years to end up wearing a police uniform, which has nothing to do whatsoever with what i have learned in school. all those advanced algebra and differential equations means jack now.   4 long years of differential equations... *sigh*

      i have been feeling like this for a couple of months now, ever since i turned down the job at Schlumberger, a multi-national company, which would offer me better opportunities, not to mention better and most definitely existing bonuses, to stick with my current, lousy company, who haven't paid bonuses to their employee for the last 2 years, as well as failed to promote any of the staff last year, and maybe this year too. omg! what was i thinking??  certainly, i thought that i was making the right decision at the time... i'm sure i had my reasons... i'm just not sure what the reasons were anymore...   i'm certainly looking out for other jobs right now. i'm seriously considering teaching as a career. it's just that, i do not know where to start looking. i'm only a degree holder, therefore, teaching college students might not be suitable at the moment. i'm thinking of tutoring part time, but i'm going to move soon. so, i won't have the whole school year to tutor those kids. so, what do i do?  and certainly, everything been happening at work are not helping. they're going to give this letter to all the employee for them to sign saying that they would agree to the new salary being risk/reward base. i have no idea, how much risk i'm going to have to sacrifice. gosh... i need a new job!  but, now... let's just be thankful that it's friday!!

      This whole wedding planning thing is... how do I put this... kicking my a**. I never knew that such short ceremony can cost that much money. Here's the thing... I've got 700 bucks saved for the wedding, and it's just 5 months away. Thanks a lot for the dowry I'm going to get in March, about $5000 for me to at least buy some stuff for the wedding.  Here's the rundown of the figure:  Reception (food) = $ 2800 (7 bucks a head, so they better eat up) Reception (tent) = $ 500 Reception (altar) = $ 1000 Photos = $ 400 (hopefully I can get someone to snap the pics for me instead...) Gifts = $ 500 (mom says that she can get a cheaper price for it... so...) Flowers = $ 450 Music = $ 200 (not sure if I can get it that cheap) Decorations = $ 500 Bedroom decor = $ 300 Cake cutting = $ 200 Invitation cards = $ 275 Dress = $ 400 Main dish for bride & groom = $ 200  So it all sums up to $ 7725. That's a lotta $$$!!! This better be my one and only wedding... or else...

      it's the first day of work in the new year. Gosh, I feel tired already. I have to come up with some resolution or something. I think these are good resolutions to start out with:  1. Be more proactive - at work, especially. In finding new jobs, I mean. Hah! 2. Drink more water - I need to get rid of the extra calories. I think drinking water helps. 3. Exercise & more exercise. My wedding is coming up soon. So I better start running now if I want to get into the dress. 4. Make more money. I need the extra money for my wedding... where should I start? 5. Stop cussing... no 'f' word, or s**t, or a**hole, or any of the malay cuss words. 6. Find better company to work for. I love my job. But unfortunately, this is not the company for me. 7. Get enrolled for Masters. MBA. This year. 8. Get married!!! The date is set to 30th May of this year. I'm so excited. Better get prepared. 9. Be grateful. Say more thank yous, to everybody, God, parents, fiancee, friends, colleagues... 10. Wake up in the morning with a smile. EVERYDAY! :)  I think that ought to do it. Simple resolutions to follow. Less headache. When should I start? ;)

       fiance   It's the night of 2nd January, a day after I was engaged to H. Wow! I'm someone's fiancee now. How do you like that? To tell you the truth, there's something different about it, being engaged, I mean. It's like, you wonder if you really know the other person or not. It's something to get used to. Hopefully, only a short while.  I can't believe what happened yesterday, during the engagement party. I was completely unprepared. Nonetheless, I am glad it went well. I was planning for something more humble, but it turned out great. The party was definitely for me. I can't thank my aunt enough for making it happen. And my parents. Pretty much everybody. I felt completely ashamed and clueless, and happy all at the same time.  I'm wearing the engagement ring now. It's nothing elaborate, although I wish I had a Tiffany engagement ring on right now. Maybe later on...  Fiancee... now that word really does mean something.

      here's another office politic story that you love to hate.  things have been quite hectic at work lately with tight deadlines, miscommunication, stress about paycheck and inexperience co-workers trying to do your job for you. but this one is on top of the list, and it has been nothing but annoyance on my expense.   it is sad to know that your colleague can't stop but bad-mouthing you to other colleagues in a language you don't understand. maybe the error is mine, but to tell everyone and gang up on me about it is very unprofessional. it was quite disturbing, and left an effect on me all day through out the day, to know that these are the people that i have to spend my 8 hours of my day with, day in and day out. so, my only way to resolve this, professionally, is to let them talk all they want and hopefully see the errors of their ways. and only then, can i 'fart in their general direction' and send them to their deliverance. ;)

      i'm trying to overshadow the depressing moment i had yesterday by telling you the eventful day i had on sunday. :)  we finally bought the ring on sunday. actually, we went to the store on saturday to buy the ring, but surprise, surprise, my ring i had surveyed a month ago was no longer there. we had asked the salesperson to call another outlet, to see if they carry my ring, and surprise again, she said she called and the other outlets no longer carry my ring. i was quite devastated, until we went again on sunday to another outlet, and surprise, again... they HAVE my ring. yeay!  it was this really, sophisticated, 7 diamond ring, round shaped, sitting across the ring, which in turn looks very good on my not-so-fat ring finger. and of course, all the emotional attachment to the ring that goes with it.

      i had another small argument with sam yesterday. this time, i do not know whose fault it was. maybe it was more mine than his. i think i was being childish, and paranoid.  i wanted the wedding to be perfect. and that include the dress, the gifts, and the party. the stupid argument we had yesterday was about the gifts. when we first laid out the list for the gifts, i was actually quite glad when he said that he already had a pair of nice shoes and belt for himself, so i wouldn't have to buy him a new one and just go ahead and buy my own pair of shoes.  it was all fine then until yesterday.  i wanted the gifts to be perfect. i wanted to get him a pair of shoes that he would like as a wedding gift, and i wanted him to do the same for me. so, any hint he had about SAVING me money buying his shoes was quite hurtful. and yes. this sounds incredibily stupid. i know.  but i guess things are okay now. it's just another day where things don't quite go my way...

      today, i have decided not to write in all the depressing and stupid stuff that happened at work. it's a never ending story. there are just too many stupid people working here in the company and i'm tired of complaining about them. so, i'm going to write up on something more eventful, or enlightening that had happened yesterday.  sam and i went shopping yesterday, for the wedding gifts. actually, i meant to just go window shopping, check out the prices and make a list or a budget to see how much i should spend on it. well. here's the story. we went to klcc, just to check out the shoes and handbags, and maybe some of his items at the designer stores at klcc. i was actually quite uncomfortable, knowing that i was wearing shorts and sneakers and so was sam. we were under-dressed for that kind of activity, designer shopping, but who gives a rat's a**. i've got money, and i'm buying. maybe not now, but soon. but somehow, going into those stores made me feel uncomfortable. maybe i'm not 'there' yet. maybe my makeup or my hair was not done properly. whatever it is, i felt concious going in the stores. i'm sure a lot of people feels the same way, unless they've got money.  and here's the thing. yesterday was probabily the first day i've ever bought anything italian. or designer like. and i'm so embarrassed to know that it is hard for me to appreciate the finer things in life. i bought these really nice bruno magli pumps, that was on sale for 500 ringgit. i was like, omigod. and then i stopped and think how shallow i was at that moment of time, but hey... again, who gives a rat's a**.  but now, i just can't stop thinking of my new bruno magli shoes... ;)

      things at work have been pretty hectic lately, with all of the new 'incentive' plan put in place, deadlines and all the attitude change that goes along with it. i must say, i hate the f**king system. just yesterday, i felt that i had to walk over fields of mines, just not to offend anybody, so that i can get a job to perform. it's so political. it's annoying as hell.  and with all these going on, they still expect me to work on weekends. how annoying is that?

      sam and i had a conversation yesterday about trust. well, maybe not a conversation, but misunderstanding of what trust means to each other. no, it's not about another woman, or another guy, but trust in each other in general. or let me just be specific, it was about financial responsibility and trust that goes along with it. somehow, in one of our financial plans for the wedding, he mentioned that he didn't trust me with his money. i took a step back to carefully understand what he said, but i couldn't hold back all the emotions that went through my head. no, i didn't burst out crying in public. and no, i didn't storm out of the restaurant, making a scene. i was defensive, though, knowing what we were about to go through, marriage, is nothing but a contract of full of trust.  i'm trying to understand from his point of view. maybe, i've been too dependent on him, financially. maybe, i've been hurting his wallet by doing so. it's unhealthy for him, and for me, if things keep going that way. i should be more responsible for myself. fine...

      "We would like to present this prestigous award to the most annoying and dimwit co-worker of the year, and the nominees are: Mike, for 'Dumb and Dumber', and Mike, for 'Lord of the Idiots'. and the winner is Mike, for 'Lord of the Idiots'!"  i have been around in IT for quite sometime now, and i can say that i've been in enough IT projects, to get to know all the dumb people who worked in it. but, this is the worst yet. first of all, i can't believe the project manager, who, i must say, is another nominee for the idiot award, assigned the design to the most inexperienced engineer, and worse yet, have zilch knowledge of usability and design. this is the most idiotic decision ever made in any organization to have an engineer design the business process and interface of the system. i mean, if you were to do hire an engineer with 3000 bucks salary, you might as well have my grandmother to do it for free.  and this mike dude, has no regards whatsoever of personal space. he speaks so close to you that you can smell what he had for breakfast. i even told him 'mike, can i have some personal space, please?', moved myself away from him, and the farther i move back, he naturally step forward, even closer. if i had moved back anymore, i'd be sitting on my desk, screaming aaaaaaaaaa, get away from me!!!

      i can't wait to get out of this corporate bulls**t. i hate how the corporate world manipulate people just to ensure the business is profitable. i mean, i understand what it means to have a business. but not to the extend of draining out the life of your employees to their very last spirit, just to make sure you hit your target. it's just wrong.  but who am i to judge. i'm just a mere, talented, waiting to wake up the world with my undeniable abilities to change the very essense of how the world works. well... it might be stretched out just a little, but they have no idea of what i am capable to do and what values i can bring to their lives. they just don't know it yet, but they are about to find out. but first, i'll make sure i get my full salary by the end of the company's financial year.  anywho,  i had a dialogue with one of the senior management of the company. to be frank, i was quite flattered and honored and i must say, a sense of pride came over me, when of all the talented people in the company, I get to talk to him about the company's new 'incentive' plan. i had so much questions, and the feedback that i got wasn't what i had expected. although, he made it sound that the company is making a very sound, positive plan, however, the plan is just too hard for me to fit in. let's just say, with the plan that he had for the company, i would not have enough jobs to do, and at the end, i can go ahead and say goodbye to my hard and supposedly-earned salary.  that was yesterday. today, my boss came and talked to me about it. and i tried to be frank for most of the time. he expressed his concerns on his position, to fit with the new company plan. frankly, he said, he feels 'redundant'. i can't blame him. the bottom line of the 'incentive' plan IS to drive out redundancy, and that for most of it, consists of these high, sky-rocketing paid managers who does jack for the company. and i must say, i was quite glad that the plan is going to be carried out the way it is. AND, he mentioned that he felt guilty that he made me stay, when i had the chance to leave few months ago. he 'sincerely' thought that things would not turn out the way it is now. i wanted to say 'it's your f***ing fault' but i can't. I made the decision to stay, and i'm willing to live with it.

      sam's fishing for my compliments right now for the things he did at work. i acknowledge his hard work and how professional he is with his job. but sometimes, when it comes to careeer wise between the both of us, it's always about him. about how he got his new job, how fast he learned the things at work, how his staff is everyday, how unrealiable his staff is. i suppose, if it's not me whom he can brag his career to, then, who??... so, i suppose i should be supportive. but when it comes to the point where he just don't acknowledge my achievements, how good i was at my presentation, how wonderful i was at my job, that just throws me off. i had to mentioned to him 3 times yesterday, just for him to acknowledge what i did, and still, the focus turned to him.  i'm just bitching. just wish i have someone i can brag about my work to...

      good god. i'm tired. i had just finished with this one event where i was the MC, with this other guy in the company. i must say, it went quite ok. except, i stumble a little bit here and there. and i must say, how embarrasing it is to meet up with all of these people and they'd say what a good job it was.  anywho... i just have tonnes of things to say about the event, and the company and how much crap they threw at us, but for now, i'll just shut my mouth and just let it be....  btw... watch out for the launching of my news-casting career soon.... ;)

      last weekend was an interesting one. last weekend, i had the opportunity to practice my voting right. regardless or not i know the person i'm voting, to know that i had earned that right, to choose the leader of my country was an interesting event. and sam was with me the whole weekend. he spent the weekend with my family, again, and it feels good to have him around. although, we had a misunderstanding while driving back to ipoh (i'll spare you the details), nevertheless, things got sorted out, and everything was alright again.  anywho, i went to bridal store to try out my dress they're almost finishing, and good god, i've gained weight. i can't fit in one of the dress. yikes. gotta start running again soon. starting tonight, i'm going to the condo gym and run for at least 30 minutes. gotta loose that weight, gotta loose that weight. hmm..  another thing that has been bugging my mind is that the fact that i'm tired of this routine, day in and day out, making some corporate figure richer and richer, while i slave myself in this never ending assumption they are feeding me that i'm actually working myself to my 'ultimate' career goal, when the fact is, the people upstairs and laughing their a** off at my expense. i mean, what is the point? enough of this corporate bulls**t. can't wait to get out of this vicious cycle. i hate this rat race.

      finally... a time for me to breathe. things have been hectic at work. i've been working like mad. i've been thingking about work around the clock. and finally, just a little bit of the project left, to tie the loose knots here and there. and after that... free, i am not. *sigh*  i guess i've been complaining about work quite a bit. but sometimes, things ARE good at work. for example, there's going to be new career series on tv for some of the companies here in malaysia, and guess whose career is going to be featured in it? ME! ME! ME! :) so, i'm going to be on tv. go fara! yeah!  but other than that, i just can't wait to get out of this hell hole. a new environment with new attitude and new things to learn. i just need to be reminded that work used to be something you want to do.  anywho...  things are going pretty well with sam. and his mom too, if i might add. just the other day, on my day off, his mom and i 'hanged out' or some sort. she got her haircut, did some shopping, bought lunch. so, i suppose, things are quite okay between her and me. she's not really keen on her other daughter in law. they don't see eye to eye in some things. but hey, that's not my problem.  but sam's been busy with his new job nowadays. i know that he's trying really hard to move up the company as fast as he could, and i'm just proud of how hard working he is. :) good things come in a good package...

      my wedding is only 40 something days away. the closer it gets, the worse my paranoia gets. i might actually have something to worry about, or i might not.  helmi is having his birthday party this friday, at nouvo. who's helmi, you might ask. helmi is a whole different story, which i won't get into now. let's just say that he is one of sam's good friend, and he's having a birthday party, which i cannot go to. so, sam's gotta go by himself. knowing for a fact that the party is gonna happen at one of the 'happening' club in town, a sense of paranoia came over me. sam and i was talking about it yesterday, and he kept misleading me to say that i have got nothing to worry about cuz nothing would happen, but at the same time, he was jokingly saying that he can't do anything if things were to happen to him. let's just hope that the joke is not going to be on me.  to tell ya the truth, i wish i know him, i mean, really know him, very well. fact is, i still have doubts. sometimes, i feel that he's a total stranger. i don't know if any of you felt the same about your significant other, but there's that moment where you suddenly feel awkward. let me just get to the point. i'm saying, i just don't feel that i know him enough to know that he won't do anything to hurt me because it is not in his nature to do so. there's very few people in this world who fits this category. so, i'm kind of freaking out right now, because i have no choice but to trust him at the party this friday. sadly enough, he has only one chance to screw things up.

      it's only 46 days away from my wedding, and my face is peeling terribly. this is a case of pre-wedding screw up. my mom talked me into it, just so you know. she wanted to use this cosmetic product so bad, cuz she has few friends who tried it before, and their skin all so white and smooth, so i ended up paying over 200 bucks for 2 bars of soap and 2 small bottles of face lotion. now the stupid soap and lotion is causing the skin on my face to peel terribly, not to mention the stings on my face everytime i tried to wash it or put lotion on it. so, what can you do...?  anywho. i'm planning to go for a facial next weekend anyway. this time, from a trusted agent or beauty product. i'm thinking of going to this avon boutique for my facial and it's only going to cost me $19.90 for the first session. god knows how much it's gonna cost me for the treatment after that....

      more corporate bulls**t. i came in to work today, with the usual feeling of incredible annoyance. good way to start your monday, huh? as soon as i got to work, i felt irritated and angry and... then came this email of another 'restructuring' going on in the organization. my new 'boss' whom I hardly know, wants all of us to define our role in the group. this whole 'defining' thing better be coming to an end, cuz i can't take another 'definition of my friggin role' in the company.

      i called one of my old friends to invite him to my wedding. it was awkward, because we haven't spoken to each other for a long time. turns out he's married, with one daughter. i was surprised, because he said he mentioned to me before. i suppose i wasn't paying attention because he jokes around, most of the time.  i find it amazing how my life and the lives of the people around me turned out. we all met at some point of our lives, then we went on our separate ways only to be surprised on where life would take us. i'm glad on how things turned out for me. to be able to spend my life and grow old with the one i love.

      today was a day of reflection. i was bored out of my mind at work, and so i went through all the emails in my hotmail inbox, from 1998. i had forgotten about it, cuz they were all archived in their own little folder. it was quite interesting reading them back, and i do mean 'interesting'.  most of the emails i read were from my past relationships, both the ups and downs. i felt sad, somehow, how some things turned out the way they did to get me where i am now. some of them were good and some of them were downright nasty. whatever happens to them? are they happy? have they changed?  how funny it is to see how my life turned out the way it did. regardless how bad things get, you'll always land on your feet. it might hurt a little or a lot, depending on how hard you fell, but always, things have their own way of working themselves out. regardless of how hard it is going to be with sam after this, i'll be ok. and you will too, whoever you are... :)

      it has ben so long since i felt this good knowing that i'll be married.. in just 2 weeks. feel glad, relieved, happy and excited all at the same time. before, it was just nerve-wrecking, paranoid and frustrated at times. i can actually picture our lives together. but i try not to picture too much in my mind, just to keep it exciting, and not to build up too many expectations and such. just want to go with the flow.   wow. i'm getting married in 2 weeks.  in other news, today is the day the VSS result gonna come out. it's already 11:45 am, and yet to get the news. to tell you the truth, i'm scared out of my mind for the uncertainty, especially with my new married life and all. will i get another job in time? how will sam and i manage our finances if i were out of job? what if i didn't get it? what will happen then?...

      it's getting closer now. 2 weeks away to my wedding day. the day i'll be called a wife. yikes. there's that funny feeling again, each i time i think about it. are we, sam and i, ready to do this? ready or not, it's pretty much done. in the next to week or so, we will vow eternity with each other. to vow eternity, do one know if he/she made the right choice, or is it something we all stumble upon, and just go along with it, hoping for the best? i think it's a bit of both. regardless whether it is meant to be or not, it needs work. and lots of work i must say, based on what had happened two days ago.  sam and i finally had the financial talk. how we feel about each other past debts. he mentioned to his friends before how beautifully i manage my debts, that i have no credit, other than my student loan, which sums up to 150 a month, and my car loan. he, on the other hand, has got 3 credit card payments, 2 loans and a car loan. so, when we had our talk on how we would manage our financials once we got married, i felt it was a bit unfair for us to combine our income to pay the bills, which eventually means i'd be paying his credit card debts too. he got a little defensive, saying that i had agreed to share our income previously. yes i did. to pay OUR bills. to cut the story short, we're finally speaking to each other again, and he's agreed to paying his debt first.  that was not what really bothered me. what bothered me was how we handled conflict with each other. we were polite to each other the whole time we weren't 'speaking' to each other. too polite, i think. then there was the uncomfortable silent, hoping that the other person would speak up and say they're sorry. the longer we weren't talking, the worse it gets, cuz i wouldn't know what he was thinking, either he was re-enacting past quarrels back in his mind, and thinking that, he doesn't deserve to be treated such, and thus depleting his 'emotional bank account, as stephen covey would say it. i can't say it happened to me, but i was hurting the whole time.  anywho. i love him and i want to spend my life with him, for as long as we can, whatever it takes.
