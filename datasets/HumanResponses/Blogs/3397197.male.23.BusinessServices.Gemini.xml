      Hi, I am sunder, working with India's number one call centre in New Delhi.Call centre business or the so called outsourcing business is said to be one of the fastest growing business in the world but not everyone would agree to it.The reason for this being the odd working hours, and many more which I cannot remember since I being a part of it!!!!It is said that in the coming times, this business is tipped to be the biggest money grosser for the country.But the question to be answered is are we ready for it?I think we in India are yet to come in terms with the modalities of a call centre job.Reasons are many, one being the conservative approach which many of our family members have.They have been brought up in an environment wherein if the son is pursuing B.COM, then he must concentrate on getting a job which is related to his studies, that is commerce and similar for a student of science who is not expected to look anywhere outside his subject of interest.Anything outside would be treated as breach.Money would not matter in this case.When are we going to come in terms with the realities of life. I strongly believe that to be successful, you need to move with the times, be flexible .Also, one must remember that the biggest strength that a man can have is that of self belief and we must have it.You need not be a academic genius to be successful in this world.Just be yourself.  And now coming back to the topic.There would always be people who will talk against you,since when I joined this call centre job, I was a fledgling as far as this job was concerned.And there were more detractors then motivators.And To succeed against all the odds was not an easy task.I am a graduate in commerce(B.COM(HONS)).And the process I am working is a high end technical process.I have never worked on computers in my 12 years of school and another three years of fulfilling college life.People would have betted 10 out of 10 against me to fail.But I was confident that I will make it big.And within the next six months of my job, my name was there among the top 10 performers.And today I am earning more than what I thought I could.This was a result of the self confidence, the hard work and the determination to succeed I had.But even today , there are people who keep telling me to study for a professional course.At this, I only tell them one thing, I am ready to do that provided you guarantee me that I will get a job after the completion of the course.And there are no answers to these questions!!!!!!  I have always believed in planning things.And now that I have completed my first year in the job, I am going to study for a professional course(M.S IN FINANCE) but along with the job.
