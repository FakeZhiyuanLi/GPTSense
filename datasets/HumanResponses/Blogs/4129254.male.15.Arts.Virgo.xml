      I woke up, got outta bed, dragged a comb across my head, got on the computer and ripped off the Beatles... I feel gross, dirty, angry, hot,. Not a nice mood to be in. Ch-check this out, I got a disposable digital camera. Who knows that they make those? Ten friggin bucks, not bad. Otherwise, pretty boring day with Chad...

      The world is dark, everything is black and white. The people have no color, the lights are gone. I see pictures of you and I smile, for they are in color. I think of you and me, so happy, you deep in my arms and we're happy because we are perfect for eachother. But one day, it crashed and ever since the world lost its color. Why did I have to say what I said and do what I did? Do you know that I'm sorry? Do you know that when I look at your picture, I cry? You know this but you pretend not to care and I know you're mad and life without you is dull and gray. I continue walking down the street and briefly glance into a cafe and the world becomes bright again. The sky becomes blue, the lights flash and the people are happy. My heart restarts as I gaze at the back of your head as you pay for coffee at the counter. I touch the window and as I do, you turn around and once again, color fades from the world again. Alas, it it not you. I feel cheated because the slightest glance at your face would allow my emotions to return. I walk back to my place, opent the door and see you sitting on my couch. I now it's you but there is still no color. What are you doing here? I ask. Because we need to talk, you say. I sit, you sit, we all fall down. I'm sorry for what I did and there are millions of things I want to know, but the words evade me. You see, whether you know it or not, you're the one who keeps me going. I look in the mirror in the morning ans ask "Why?", but I see your reflection, much brighter than mine, behind me. You are the physical answer to my question. When I'm driving on a bridge, I think, "Why not?", and I see your picture on my dashboard and the light pours out of my car and you once again answer my question. Remember when we first met and I told you that I could read your eyes? You thought I was kidding until I did and you were nervous because everything I said about you was true. When we talked, you were timid and I was not and when and when I said something funny you let out a nervous giggle. When you did something you thought was stupid, I brought you back up by saying it was cute and you giggled again but I was serious. Remember how you said guys didn't like you because you thought your glasses were dumb? I told you there weren't and that your eyes were perfect and your glasses only made you prettier. You thought I was being sarcastic but when I leaned over and kissed you, everything in the world was perfect. There was no pain, no war, no      , no hunger. All was full of love and you knew it and I knew it. There was that one time when I said I didn't deserve you , do you remember that? I said I was afraid that you really didn't care about meand you were just friends with me to be nice. You then said that every moment with me was worth it and you leaned over and kissed me and I knew that I would never love a person more than I loved you as long as       ran through my veins. But all of that changed, do you remember what I said to make you so mad? So mad as to walk out on me? I don't remember and I'm glad I don't because I don't ever want to repeat it. You see the sorrow and Pain in my eyes and you begin to cry. You had your doubts, who wouldnt? But the moment you looked into my eyes, you finally realized that nobody feels the same way about you but me. You saved me, made me a better person, the person I truly am. You say you're sorry, too and I begin to cry as well. Crying, we embrace and as we do, the sky turns blue, the lights turn back on and life returns to our faces. The roads we walk stray and become difficult to traverse. We will fight, we will quarrel together, but you know and I know that we are srtonger than that. Do you know why? Because what doesn'y kill you only makes you stronger.

      I awoke this morning in a bit of pain. Yesterday (while mowing my lawn) I happened to step on a rather large underground series of tunnels, collapsing them and sending my size 12 foot into a small hole. I pull my foot out only to see several hornets emerge from the abyss. I ran like OJ from the cops (I hope he doesn't read that, protect ya neck!). And yes, I was stung. But fear not for this troubled youth, I have a rather high pain tolerance. I really dislike Ashlee Simspson. Has anybody NOT heard that infernal song that is played OVER and OVER  on that beast of a station they call "MTV? If I hear it just ONE MORE TIME,  I vow to take a radio DJ hostage. Now a good band not played nearly enough? The Shins. If Weezer was from seattle, this is what they would sound like. My, I must say, I am a fine ranter. Peter, Why would he be bluffing? He just bet CNN...

      Change the mood from glad to sadness. I've holed myself up in my small home for the past few days and I feel like either a prisoner or a refugee, but it doesn't actually matter because both are terrible things to be. But today, I woke up and hope was born again when I opened my blinds and bursts of sunlight  shot through the        (the past few days have been wet and gray, but not rainy). Today shall be the day of days. Why you ask? Because I like to say the term "Day of Days",  it's a it catchy. I am no longer the mindless moping zombie I have been, but rather mindfull, energetic [--------] (I can't think of something for this word, you put something in, personilize[sic] it, so you'll like it better). I leave you with this: If I know where I was going, I would already be there....

      Change the mood from glad to sadness. It's already halfway through the day and I've only been conscious for half an hour. I'm beggining to believe Keith Moon's theory on sleep: "Sleep is for wankers". I really like that one Why am I so cold? I'm serious, it's sunny and beautiful outside but I'm shivering like the mind plagued with madness. Just three minutes ago, I figured out the difference between butter and "I can't believe it's not Butter" (I saw through the (        ). If I knew where I was going, I would already be there...

      It's 10:15 in the morning, I'm more tired then I have ever been and I feel like I have a mental hangover. If somebody reads this, please, for the love of God, Budha, Jehovah and Alah, give me some sleeping pills for tonight and punch me in the face for today, I fear I won't wake up fully today and mope around the house like a mindless zombie smug in the wooly cotton brain of infancy (I totally ripped that last line off, sorry Jim).  If only I could somehow snap myself out of it, any suggestions?

      Being back in CT still sucks. Thats all I'm gonna say, and if you say "oh, you're too young to complain, you don't know what your talking about,"  then you come and live in this modern hellhole for a week! God, I'm starting to lose my mind here, I've taken refuge inside my airconditioned house, starting to hear voices.... but on a later note; just got me the new Morrisey CD, brilliant stuff, just brilliant, made me like The Smiths even more. And another good band: The Scissor Sisters. The return of the superfun [gay] disco band! They sound like early 70's Elton John, so infectious...

      I'm back at the homefront after a vigerous 3 1/2 drive (yeah, I'm a wuss, wanna make somethin of it?). No more angry bikers or trailer trash of Eastern New Hampshire, I'm back to the corrupt politicians and rich people with companies built on phony money of Connecticut, so nice to be home...

      Here I am, posting mid-week. Found me an internet cafe in New Hampshire, (5 bucks for 30 minutes, sweet) So liberal here! So much Bush bashing, I feel so at home, no new poetry, haven't gotten around to writing anything new, maybe later...

      This post is in memory of the original Superfreak, Rick James, discovered in his home today. (Cocaine) was indeed a hell of a . At 12:00pm tommorow, everyone will belt out a hearty "I'm Rick James, *BITCH*!!!!!"

      This will be my last post until next week, taken me a vacation to a swank condo in New Hamshire. Ride the snake, I really like that quote, I heard this live Doors bootleg at the Whiskey-A-Go Go when Jim freaked out during "The End", and thats what he said, Ride the snake. Then he absolutely snaps "Kill The Father, f**k the mother"!. How high on acid do you gotta be to yell stuff like that during a concert? Goodbye to all, If I'm not back by sunrise, Avenge my      ...

      I'm a bit into poetry. I gave a measly attempt at songwriting and realized I'm better a poetry. Funny, I don't know many (how shall I say...) young males my age into poetry. I enjoy it though. It's funny, I feel like I'm writing down some random words, notes, ideas, and as soon as somebody reads it, they say something like "My God, it is the most beautiful thing I've ever read!". It does wonders for the self esteem.

      In the new day you must listen close, Try to see through the infinate scribble, But they feed you to much and you overdose on the mindless, the [shit] and the dribble, Because what they say in our brand new day has already been said in the past, But the blind ones don't see and invite them for tea, And their self card of       has been cast, What has happenned to the land of the gods? Where wonders loved alongside the shore, Your now blindfolded in heat &amp; chained to your seat On a bas way back to '84, Look behind the curtain and show your masses, What has been fed to you for so long, Wake up from the dream beyond twilight's vast gleam, And tell me what really is wrong, Just please let me ask "Why do you wear a mask?", "Because when removed, the slaves, they abhor", See, what you really can't view is the freak inside you, And you're just as grotesque as before...

      When the doors of perception open, Nothing holds you back, From gazing onwards into the deep infinities of truth and fiction, As soon as you realize that the only lock on your door is yourself, your mental key clicks and you are free, In the otherworld, Beauty's perfect body       s lovingly in the arms of Insanty, While sick thoughts race through his mind, Inteligence and Anger share drinks at the bar, Discussing why Sensibility is never any fun to hang around with, When your emotions are vivid enough to buy eachother drinks, then you can learn. Learn to control, learn to use, learn to manipulate yourself.

      I'm talking about reversing your internal clock. What you do is you force yourself to sleep during the day and stay up all night until your body adjusts. You trick your body t believe that day is night and night is day. You feel like a friggin vampire. Me and some friends did it about a week ago and filmed the whole thing... It was like a documentary in the mind of a psycotic insomniac. Trying to set yourself straight again is even worse. I described it to my cousin who recovered from a        addiction and he claims the first few days of getting off        is similar to trying to re'set your internal clock... trippy...

      Welcome to the world of the un-official Lizard King (that title belongs to the singer/songwriter/poet/genius Jim Morrison). Rock is what I do and how I live. Or at least I like to think I do. I believe that I know more about music than most people my age (I ain't tellin you so just guess). Thats about it....
