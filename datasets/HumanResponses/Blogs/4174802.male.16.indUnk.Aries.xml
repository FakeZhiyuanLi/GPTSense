      I havent updated this in awhile, so here we go:  Soccer has started and so I'm more busy than usual, and I'm more tired and sore than usual, so I'm going to be earlier. But don't get me wrong, I love soccer and I'm glad that practice has started... I'm sooo pumped for this years season, I really think that we will do well, cuz we are actually working together as a team and alot of people have improved and the new kids that we have are actually decent players, plus we are in a disctrict or whatever this year and so if we win a certain amount of certain games, we can go to playoffs, which might actually happen, so I'm happy about that.  Well, that's all for now, and so once school starts i will update this daily... but until then, don't excpect this to be updated often...

      Well today wasnt nearly as fun as tuesday.... but oh well.  There really isnt anything to write about so here is a song by Ethos called Sky Dark Blue:  Sky Dark Blue  shining sparks falling in air satellites signal home  wish you were here instead of up there promise me never to be alone  midnight on the trampoline embers dying as they seem to dance like we used to dance on February nights  shine the flashlights on the ground sleeping on air, our hearts pound crack a smile at me, your face has never been so bright  I can’t doze when I’m next to you I lie frozen Only you  Incessant showers of cold rain Wash away all our pain This is the only moment like this I’ve had in my life  Remembering all our scrapes and cuts And all the times we spilled our guts Emotions cutting through me like The blunt edge of a knife  I can’t doze when I’m next to you I lie frozen Only you  Just promise me we’ll be best friends Although we’ve already reached the end I know that I will think of you Every time I see sky open up to blue… [Blew] it all away Never thought that I’d ask for just one more day I have to show you all the ways you mean the world to me

      Yesterday was so much fun... and im glad  As usual, i woke up at about 11 yesterday and then came down stairs to talk online with people... and that was fun... I got to play minesweeper with Logan, Caleb's little brother, and i was gonna play checkers with daylin but i had to go...  There was a party at daylin's sisters house at 4:00 and it was so much fun.  Jake, Craig, Ashley, Stephanie, and Me all came.  We rode 4-wheelers for awhile and then decided to take this really cute puppy back to her home cuz she was at the wrong house, and so she wouldnt follow us, so i picked her up and carried her while riding the 4-wheeler, and i dont know if it was scared or what but for awhile it would squirm and stuff and i almost dropped her, and if i would have then i dont know what i would have done, cuz she was such a cut puppy and the sad thing is, is that she gets beaten by her owner.... so we rode for a little longer after that and then came inside cuz we were gonna watch a movie from pay per view. While we were deciding... the brownies in the oven got baked, and then we were hungry and Craig suggested that we get some wings, not from red bull, ordering them from this place down the road. So we all (mainly Stephanie and Ashley and Daylin, thanks guys) got some money and put it together and we had like 20 dollars so we had plenty, so I ordered the wings and Daylin and Craig were gonna ride the 4-wheeler down to the place to pick them up, but they needed someone to carry the wings, but when you think about it, only 2 ppl had to go, but so anyway, Daylin and I rode one and then Craig drove the other, so about 3/4 of the way there, Craig runs out of gas... so we all three of us went back to her sis's house, after we pushed the 4-wheeler into the high grass-ditch.... so we got some gas and then brought it to the other 4-wheeler, and then while craig was filling it up, me and daylin went and picked up the wings, and when we went inside it was scary, cuz ive never been in there before, it was really dark and the ppl there were just staring at me and daylin, and giving us dirty looks, but anyway, this really nice lady/hick/mother of a girl from school/ told the lady behind the counter that someone was there to pick up wings, so we got the wings and went back to her sis's house. So when we got back, we ate outside on her porch and talked and stuff and then when we were all going back inside, ashley spilled her drink on herself cuz the dog ran into her, and then so the door is open and one of the cats goes outside and its not supposed to... so daylin chases after it and gets it... so then we all want to ride the 4-wheelers again. except stephanie, so anyway we all took turns except for stephanie and so we were going on a different path than from earlier and there is a huge puddle, like literally huge, both deep and wide, and anyway we all go thru it on the 4-wheelers and get soaked and so while me and ashley are riding with daylin and craig, jake and stephanie go down towards where the puddle is and try to scare us, and so they stay near the puddle while we all drive thru the field and stuff, and then we go back and jake is playing in the puddle, and says to drive by and get him wet, so craig and i go back down the trail and jake and ashley and daylin are standing near the puddle and we drive thru it and everyone gets soaked, except for stephanie cuz she ran back to the house cuz craig and daylin tried to drive the 4-wheeler right into her. but anyway we all get off and have a mud fight for about 5 min. and then walk back to the house, and by then, the mud has dried, but we all wanted to get a picture taken before we hose off... so steph finds a camera, but there is no film so we wait around, and eventually just go to get hosed off... and i took the hose to wash off my face and i pressed it too hard and it jetted into my eye and it hurt soooo bad, but anyway, the mud wasnt coming off of our skin!, it stained us... so we all tried as hard as we could and then we all took showers and most of it came off then cuz of the soap and stuff, so then after we all took showers we went into the hot tub and it felt so good cuz it was so cold standing in the wind earlier when we were wet from hosing off... so we were in there for 15 min or so and then went inside to watch a movie, so we watched most of Sleepy Hollow, it was pretty cool, and funny too, but anyway Craig's dad came at 11 and we were all getting a ride home from him, yet his dad didnt know yet, but anyway, that was the end of the party and it was so much fun and thanks to stephanie for basically paying for the wings and also for "taking care of us" when we were muddy and wanting to get inside, and also thanks to Craig's dad for giving us all a ride home...

She is putting together a scrap book thingy for when i graduate.. which is coming soon.. and its wierd to like "look back" on the things that i have done... LoL.. wait isnt that a lyric for a song.. oh well. anyway... i just really need to like focus on one thing or something cuz im only 16 yet i have soooo many things to worry about, most of which i shouldnt, but still... I don't even know what major i would take when i go to college, excuse me,  IF  i go to college...  Well whoever reads this.. which i hope is at least someone.. please pray for me, that i will get things straight with my school life....

      Well, summer isnt over yet... but i kind of wish it was... I've been sooo lazy and it actually really makes me very mad... i never got a job and i've been 16 since april and havent gotten my permit yet or even gone to take the test for it... Summer is basically over for me tho, cuz i just want school to start and get back on track and get a schedule again... and plus i cant wait for soccer to start and to be able to hang out with my friends and also because i like fall/autumn, whatever you want to call it. Well this has been my very first blog... so its ofcourse going to either be short or long and mine is short but later on i will have longer ones...
