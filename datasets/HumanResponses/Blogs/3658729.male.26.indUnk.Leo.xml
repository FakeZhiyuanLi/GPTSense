						   Despite knowing I have to go to work tomorrow even if it's sunday I doubt there is much that can ruin my day. This morning started as good as it gets and I think the smile I had then has been permanently stuck to my face. :D  I better focus on the soccer game. :)

						   A part of me is missing. Like a hole in my heart. Time cannot affect it. It neither grows or shrinks. Constant, just as the person holding that piece is in my mind.

						   Despite being completly worn out from working way to much I am thankful it keeps me busy. My mind drifts off to thoughts that no longer should be there too easy. I tried everything I can think of to keep it from doing that but so far nothing but working until I pass out seems to give the desired result. Right now, as I am writting this, at 12.30, after working for 10 hours without any real breaks it wanders.  Will I ever stop feeling the way I do? I doubt it. What really changes is the way I handle it, deal with it and act upon it. I hope that's enough.

						   Last night I hooked up with some fellas running a club at the University I will attend. They play in a league and for fun so I guess my free time occupation is determined. :)  They seem to be nice enough people, trying to get better and winning some games and the University is slowly starting to open their eyes and supporting them.

						   For a long time I have tried to get some kind of visa to be able to stay in the U.S. Every time I tried it ended up with me hitting a wall head first.  Now, I look at my passport. I see the visa attached to a page there and it feels so strange. I finally got it. And the emptiness crawls upon me. I won. Now what?  Not that I don't have so much else to turn my attention to, but the struggle I guess took more out of me than I would have imagined.  On a good side note I found my way back to the poetry again. Didn't write for a long time and now it's all coming back again.

						   My best friend told me that writing is good for you and I have to agree. So I created this blog as an outlet for thoughts, happenings and whatever comes my way.  Be wary though. It can get deep, boring or otherwise nuts.  I am Rouge. I am who I am and that's all I will say as an introduction and personal about me.   Hold on for the ride is about to start.

						   28 days. No, not the Sandra Bullock movie. The amount of butterflies in my tummy&nbsp;are growing rapidly in numbers. Although having 90% of everything set; room, internet connection, books, visa and more the last 2 weeks will be hectic. Soon I will have to file my intent to study so that my funds become available. Much is depending on the financial aid people not to screw up so I get my funds in time. &nbsp; The constant raining has taken its toll on people here. Tomorrow morning I head out for national guard duty. It looks to be my last one for some time. But still. Going from 8am Sunday morning to 1pm Monday afternoon is quite a shift. &nbsp; Maybe I will have some pictures of the devastation later.

						   Every now and then people ask me if I'm nervous about moving so far away. Until now the answer has been no without hesitating. Now however is a different story. As every day passes I get more nervous and jumpy about the whole thing. I guess it's normal but pretty uncommon to me. I've moved before, granted not to another country, but never had these butterflies in my tummy.  39 days left. Normally a long time but since I'm on vacation from work it's speeding by. You all know how fast those few weeks of no work passes by.  Almost finished painting the house I started on yesterday. I must have put more paint on me than on the house. It seems that way anyhow. Took me forever in the sauna and shower to get rid of it all and you wouldn't believe that places paint can get to. *sigh*  My mind is racing. On overtime. Nothing new really is it? But for a change it's all good. I'm all good. Better than good actually. But that's another story which I will keep for myself.

						   Sometimes changes comes much like a car crash. Never having time to see what hit you. I really don't know what brought this change on or why it came at a time like this. Hopefully I will know soon enough.
