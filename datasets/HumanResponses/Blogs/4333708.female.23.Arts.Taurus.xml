        This weekend I attended a beautiful wedding and here are a couple pictures. And thankfully there were NO politics involved. YES! Well a little Bush bashing, but that happens no matter where my mother and I are. ;)  Their ceremony was short and sweet, thank the Lord, so I did not get a sore ass. And we were in clear view of the most adorable children in our family. I love my little cousins, Lily and Grace. Grace is about 6 (going into first grade!) and Lily is 3ish. Another addition came right after my birthday in May. Her name is Ruby and she's HUGE. I can only say her name if I talk in my most deepest, manish voice. She's the biggest baby I have ever seen, even bigger than me when I was born (8 lbs 14 oz and 22" long). I thought that was impossible. So obviously when she grows up she will be a petite and gorgeous girl. OBVIOUSLY!  So back to the wedding, it was great. White everywhere, flowers everywhere. The bouquets were amazing. They were those big bunches of little flowers, like lilacs, but not; if I could remember the name, then I wouldn't be me. Everyone had a different color of these flowers. I was so amazed at the beautiful factor. Jamie and Debbie (the couple) are so simple and chill so it was a big shocker to see such a together and gorgeous wedding. I guess that's rude, but hey, that's me.  And when I realize how to put pictures on here, I will.  Oh I will!!   urlLink PICTURES   urlLink MORE PICS

         I had a conversation the other day with a Republican.  It was very strange to say the least.  There were three of us.  We were in a regular conversation which all of a sudden took a political turn.  Tom is a Republican.  Terri is an Independant.  And I, of course, am a liberal liberal liberal Democrat. Terri says, "I think that all politicians, Republican or Democrat, are a bunch of lying snakes."  Which I agree with to a point, however I would throw in Independants and anyone else who may be in the political scale. Tom says, "So you're saying that Democrats are a bunch of lying snakes?" in his slow Southern accent. Terri looked at me at the same time I looked at her.  "I think they both are." "But you're saying, Democrats... are a bunch of lying snakes." For about 35 minutes he debated with Terri on Democrats being a bunch of lying snakes.  And I see that as a huge republican trait, taking things out of context to express their own point of view and to make themselves look more like you than you want them to be.  However, she wasn't falling for it.  I just got so annoyed that he wasn't giving up.  He just wanted her to say that Democrats = lying snakes.  I don't know if he wanted to post that around town that an Independant with a very liberal standing thinks that Democrats are lying snakes or if he just wanted to mentally lock it in, but man, I was amazed at this persistance and annoyance.  Insanity.  THIS WAS A BAR, DRINK. No politics in bars, please.
