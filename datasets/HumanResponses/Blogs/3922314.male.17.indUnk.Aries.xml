      Upon my kingdom of love in the days of old , There was a ever so lovely princess whose hair did shine like gold , With a face pure as the color virgin snow , The purest of heart and ever so radiating beauty that glows ,  She strolled outside the palace of my heart , onto the lush gardens of my kingdom , Picking the sweet buds of roses that grew from my love , in her hands only to bloom , I felt the faint breeze that blew my hair askew as nightfall grasps firmly onto the skyline , Alone I watched the sun as it slowly faded away , The moonlight accentuated the majestic tides , Only in a humble attempt to lift my spirits before the lonesome beginning of another day , All the passion I immediately felt towards her overpowers all the hauntingly hopeless dreams , Ravaging my mind into a disheartening demise,Vividly foreshadowing my visions of our eternity , Beside the shore we talked throughout the night , I couldn’t help but gaze intrepidly into her eyes , Finally I gathered up enough courage to declare unconditionally I do surrender to her beauty , Falling captive to the love that set me free , She was my enchanting princess of the dawn… Beth..

      Can u remember the electricity we felt when our hands first touched , The newness and excitement ,the heat , like a flame on a torch , Remember when I first kissed you , as our lips gently touched , Tasting each other first softly , then firmly and then openly aroused , We watched our inhibitions float far away , turning unthinkable thoughts into heavenly deeds , As our pains of the past collapsed in the wind of a quivering breath , all set free , We faded from mortal souls , and slipped into a torrent of passion and desire , Lets not fool ourselves , let us allow this desire to burn upon the candle lit in our hearts forever , Lets be in love forever and not for one night , So we don’t have to watch it all fade away when morning arrives , Lets live a whole lifetime together in moonlit hours and never look back , Even though we have our own lives to lead and our own trails to blaze , Let us not allow our flame of passion , love and desire to smolder and die under the weight of the coming morning dew , We can spend the rest of our nights to come together , And reminisce on how we first caressed away in our deepest desires ….  Baby B i love you..

      Never is there such a word which could define beauty in its purest form , Nor , such strong emotions felt for one in any way , Your eyes , deep and dark , full of charm and ever so heavenly , Bright like the stars they gaze on me with longing and fear continuously , They lure me in with their angel like magic , like the wings of a beautiful white dove , They carry me away , far within the depths of your everlasting love , Your beauty pours out an ocean of eternal waves , that washes up against the sweet shores of my heart , Leaving me swept away in a deserted island , where your presence still lingers within me, drifts apart , Words of our love are written in the sands off time , like yours and mine , shall remain till the end of time , In the deep blue halo of our love , my heart cries out to the streaming waters that flow , Drown me with the bliss , the sweet yearning of your rapid-current-kiss , Your love shines like the sun , it warms me when I’m cold ,  I long to take you in my arms ,and forever hold, Ive hungered for your loving touch , starving , your eyes once again so deep and true , Ive felt many things that I can’t comprehend , and it’s all because of you…BabyB I love you.

      Its just that , I’ve got too many things running through my mind , There isn’t anything left too look nor to find , shed too many suicidal tears , Each leading me closer to death , my last breath , there aint nothing left to fear , My time is coming near , slit , blood drip , my wrist bleeds , get down on my knees , My visions getting blurry , there’s no hurry , take time , let me die slow , let the suffering grow , Memories flash back , the first time I kissed and loved , the time I had my life all intact ,  I cant look into the mirror no more , my reflection’s are all shattered into pieces and scattered , Now dig me a hole six feet deep,make sure u burry me slit,bleed, let the slugs get me , rot away , Deceased outta love , this is whut you’ve done to me , this is how you’ve made me , All what I get for loving you and sacrificing my whole life for you…

      Heres a little something i wrote for the love of my life that i would love to share with everyone..  peace  Baby B im sure its gonna be a long and winding journey of you and me , Like a long and beautiful solemn summer night, In the midst of where my heart shall remain luminous  in our undying love , Like a moon which reflects the sun , I shall reflect you with my love , Where I be the sun and you be my moon , our love be the earth  ,  You revolve around me , keeping my love eternal , like the eternal lines of words-worth , A million words could be said , not one could be heard over the sound of teardrops falling , Calling , clinging , wanting to  be closer to you , For where I long for more dark nights , Where time may freeze in the chilly midnight air , And we have nothing to do but hold each other tight , In a warm , tender embrace ,  where I could pull you closer to my chest ,  To hear my heart beat your name on a constant tempo with no rest , I see that there are no words worthy enough to define what I feel right now , And to be close to you is not good enough , As you’re a seed planted within me , only set to Grow , Creeping through my veins with your thorns and surrounding my heart as you bloom within me , I don’t know what it is about you that gets me this way . But every time I look into your eyes and your smile , so warm and inviting , Something  frozen within me melts , and washes away everything that is wrong with the world as I know it . I can find no fault in my life in the paths  I have taken or the decisions I have made  , I know if my life were to end here and now , I would have reached the pinnacle of happiness ,  Having to have had  spent my life loving you with some kind of deeper truth . I know that even when happiness eludes my heart , and it seems that  God is out there to get me , That I can always borrow your smile with a perfect dream and a glimpse of a better world , In the reflections of your eyes . Shining sapphires , priceless.

      It hurts too much to write as I sit here to tell you my life , my mind wants to cry , And fill this page with anger , hate , pain , suffering and everything else that applies , My life is lost , and hate has conquered my soul today , so as you read this , Your reading the words of a deceased , a man deceased out of love , A man whose lost hope , whose died inside through his conquest of love , You are reading the words of man who’s death would not matter , because it already happened once , Yet he still walks and breathes as if to torture what’s left for the years that remain , I am broken as I could never be fixed , I ask you not to pray for me nor to wish me well , Cause nothing could be fixed , At this time I’m surrounded by confusion , Confused by life , confused by reality and illusion , But there’s one thing which brings me so much change , brings my soul to life and reduces the pain , Your words , your love , your care , has mended my heart , has brought me back to life , Has fixed all the shattered pieces of my life , you’ve brought me back , to love once again , I thank you , for where your love has showed me the right way to happiness and joy , and not to pain , Thank you baby b.I love you.
