      Source: Gamspot For fans of Team 17's venerable Worms--a long-running series of lighthearted turn-based strategy games--Worms World Party will undoubtedly be somewhat of a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it's clearly the best Worms game to date, as it offers all the great features found in the previous three iterations as well as the addition of several new gameplay options and modes, including the cooperative multiplayer missions. On the other hand, these new modes are only incremental changes of a formula that's nearly six years old, so players expecting significant changes to the Worms series will likely be disappointed by the latest installment.    The game features the same, great tactical battles as in its predecessors.At its core, Worms World Party is no different from the original Worms, which was released in 1995. The basic premise of the game is simple: You control a team of weapon-toting worms and take turns squaring off against other groups of human- or computer-controlled annelids on any number of side-view outrageous maps. Each team's worm is given a small amount of time to complete a specific set of actions, which typically include moving across the map to set up the optimum attacking location, executing the actual attack, and then retreating into relative safety. Worms are eliminated when you deplete their hit points or when you knock them into the water found in most levels. The weapons that are available to you range from relatively simple arms like shotguns and rocket launchers to truly over-the-top devices like exploding sheep and napalm air strikes. When all your opposing teams' worms have been killed, you're declared the winner. The game is remarkably easy to get into, thanks to its minimal interface and intuitive controls. In fact, these controls are so simple that you can direct your team's actions by using little more than a handful of keystrokes.   Despite its apparent homeliness, Worms World Party is very involved and actually contains a fair amount of depth. For instance, when attacking using a grenade, you'll need to take into account the angle of your enemy relative to your location, the distance to the enemy, the wind direction and wind speed, the fuse timer on the grenade, the "bounciness" factor of the grenade, and any possible obstructions before attempting to strike. Often you'll also need to mind sporadically placed land mines and fuel drums on each level, as a stray shot into one of these can have dire consequences. Ultimately, you'll find the game's humorous and often-surprising gameplay to be quite addictive, if unchanged from Worms, Worms 2, and Worms Armageddon.   As stated earlier, the new additions to Worms World Party are largely insignificant, as they don't affect the core gameplay at all. The game includes a reference guide called the "Wormopaedia," which sorts all of the 60-plus weapons in alphabetical order and gives a technical breakdown of each, including some helpful tips on how best to use each one. The wormpot option is also new, which is basically a random option generator designed to function like a casino-style slot machine. Before starting a game, you're given the option to pull a lever that will spin three reels. Each reel represents a certain gameplay option (such as the inclusion of exploding crates), and all three can combine for nearly 1000 different combinations, resulting in matches that are never quite the same twice. A fairly easy-to-use mission editor also lets you create your own maps, which you can then make available online for other players to download, and a new multiplayer mode will let you play cooperatively with others online. Additionally, Worms World Party comes with several new multiplayer maps, training stages, and puzzle-based single-player maps.    You can play online, or in various single-player and multiplayer modes. Publisher Titus claims that the graphics have also been updated, but you'll be hard pressed to find any notable differences between Worms World Party and Worms Armageddon. Certainly, there's nothing wrong with the graphics--you'll undoubtedly find that Worms World Party's bright colors and fluidly animated backgrounds fit the overall theme of the game quite well. Likewise, the sound effects and music, though largely unchanged from the previous game, complement the admittedly wacky visuals nicely. One serious problem that the retail version of Worms World Party seems to have is its inability to join the Worms.net multiplayer service right out of the box. When first attempting to log on to the service, we were prompted to download a 5.7MB patch before being allowed to move on. Once installed, however, the game's multiplayer component ran smoothly, despite the fact that the only server currently available is located in the UK.   It's a shame that Titus is forcing Worms fans to pay stand-alone prices for what easily could have been an expansion pack. As it is--those who've never played a Worms game or never got around to picking up Worms Armageddon will thoroughly enjoy Worms World Party. But if you're looking forward to a true sequel, you'll have to keep waiting.

      Same source In Manhunt, you play as James Earl Cash, a thuggish scumbag sent to death row for crimes unknown to the gamer. Cash is held down on a surgical table and given the lethal injection. The public know you’re dead. Wrong. The lethal injection turned out to be nothing more than a sedative to put you to sleep for a while, in which time a mysterious man known as The Director, or Stearkweather to his “friends”, transported you to a run down hell-hole known as Carcer City. Cash wakes up to find he has been given a second chance.. a second attempt at life. The chance comes with a clause though. To be set free, Cash must first obey the instructions of the power hungry Stearkweather and take part in a series of missions that will see Cash have to kill or be killed by a series of bloody hungry gangs that roam the Carcer City streets. The City has been fitted with video cameras in every nook and cranny, ready to film every sick and repulsive act that occurs within Carcer City. That’s right. You’re the new star of a disturbing snuff movie.   Contrary to this, Manhunt is far from a story driven game. In fact it is just the opposite. Rather than taking you through a set story, Manhunt takes the rather old school format of providing a number of missions as appose to a continuous story. Each mission is separate from the last, and is narrated individually by Stearkweather. The missions will place you in any number of horrible situations, where you find yourself up against any number of “hunters” from a lethal gang, who are all vying for you’re blood.   So we know the games background, but what does it play like? Well Manhunt is almost totally geared towards stealth. When people think of the “hide and seek” genre, the first games that come to mind are obviously Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid. Well you can add Manhunt to that list because in some ways, Rockstars sick sim is probably more of a stealth game than Metal Gear. Almost 99% of the time in Manhunt, Stealth is by far the best option. There is a brilliant combat system integrated into Manhunt, but unfortunately you wont get chance to use it as much as many would like. Stealth is key in  Manhunt to the point where even two on one open combat situations are seemingly impossible to win. If found by even one gang member, it’s still probably better to run and fight another day than to stand and take him on. Besides, the amount of hunters roaming any one area as the game progresses means even if you do decide to take someone on in hand to hand combat, it won't take much for the hunter to call his mates, and you’ll end up as a bloody pulp on the floor before you can say “please don’t kill me”.   But how does the stealth work? Well, each level has many different dark areas known as “safe zones” that Cash must utilise to take on the hunters. When spotted by a hunter, you must run away as quickly as you can and find a safe zone to hide in. Providing the hunters don’t see you run into the dark, you can hide safely. While this does add to the gameplay immensely, it does detract from the realism of the game. A hunter can be looking right into your eyes, but if you’re in a safe zone he can’t see you at all. If you can’t kill people with open combat, then how are we supposed to kill the games foes? Well that comes with the safe zones. By attracting a hunter to your location, he will come to investigate. Once he has finished and his back is turned, its time for you to finish him off. Cash can sneak up behind the hunter, and once he raises his arm, its time for you to move in for the kill. Providing you have a weapon in your hand, you can hold down either of the attack buttons which will trigger an offensive move from cash. Hold down attack for 1-3 seconds and you will simply kill the hunter. 3-5 seconds will trigger a more sickening finish, while holding down the button for more than 5 seconds will trigger a very violent and disturbing death sequence. These death sequences are shown from the point of view of Stearkweather’s cameras, including the fuzzy reception and “record” symbol in the top corner of the screen. Death sequences range from simply stabbing someone in the neck with a shard of glass, to hacking a hunters head off until it slices straight off his neck. Naturally, there’s some sickening scenes and more than enough blood, making this deffinently an adult only experience.

      Same source Manhunt is surprisingly rather impressive in the graphics department, and deffinently represents an improvement on most of Rockstars other games out there. The graphics are refined and there are some awesome examples of texturing, with both characters and environments all looking superb.   In fact, if you’re looking for an example of what Manhunt looks like, then Rockstars own Grand Theft Auto is a good place to start. The character models all look just like the cartoony yet compellingly realistic characters from the GTA games, only with a slight revamp. Jagged edges are a thing of the past and unlike GTA, there is not a single piece of pop-up anywhere to be seen in Manhunt. While the characters all still look rather cartoony, the environments are as impressive as they come. The run down setting looks fantastic, with every cracked wall and dingy corridor being created superbly by Rockstar. The texturing and colours have been used to excellent affect to create the dull, rusty, decaying feel of the games setting.   So we know a lot of Manhunts visuals have been adapted from GTA, but Rockstars latest adventure also has a much darker feel. The games lighting is very low key, with only moonlight and lamps providing the games light source. Manhunt also features a very grainy appearance to add to the dark feel of the game, much like that used in the Silent Hill series.   Manhunt isn’t visually perfect by any means, but is deffinently no slouch and still looks a treat. The game is also arguably Rockstars finest graphical masterpiece.

      Source: http://www.xvgn.com Manhunt is like the Pot-Noodle of the game world. Walk into any game shop, ask for it, and you get a slap for having such a sick and twisted mind. Show it your grandma and that’s your pocket money stopped for life. Yes, everything you’ve heard about Rockstars Manhunt is true. This game is sickeningly violent, and makes other blood lust driven games look like a picnic in the park with Barney the Purple Dinosaur. Come to think of it, Barney crossed with Manhunt. Now there’s a pleasant idea..   So what do we already know about Manhunt? Well for starters, unless your 18 you shouldn’t know that much about it. This is deffinently not one for the minors, and I must insist that anyone of a nervous disposition should stop reading now. In order to cover Manhunt properly ill be needing to describe some of the pretty horrific scenes witnessed in the game. Yes, Manhunt is strictly an 18 plus game and if I’m honest, is the one videogame I’ve ever played that truly does deserve the 18 certificate.   So, get the sick bags ready, turn off the lights and lock the door as we get to grips with the dirtiest, sickest game on the planet.

      Source: http://www.totalvideogames.com That said Hitman: Contracts still provides an immersive experience for fans of the stealth genre, whilst exhibiting many of the faults that will frustrate those who’ve never quite understood what all the fuss is about.  Despite claims of a new graphics engine, the visuals in Hitman: Contracts remain largely similar to its predecessor; thankfully its credit to that title, that they still look impressive. Following the change to a darker style, the locations you’ll come across are taken from slightly more risqué inspirations then what we’ve come to expect from previous titles such as the Blade inspired fetish club. A handful of new visual effects have been added to the game, particularly in terms of the spraying of blood whenever somebody gets shot. The game also introduces a novel little effect when 47 is on the verge of death, as the action slows down and colour fades from the screen to black and white; the initial impression is quite confusing, as you’re likely to think you‘ve activated some Bullet Time special power – until inevitably you die that is.  Without doubt the strongest aspect of the game lies in the audio stakes as once again IO Interactive have enlisted the assistance of Jesper Kyd, having worked on both Hitman: Codename 47 and Hitman 2: Silent Assassin along with IO Interactive’s other venture Freedom Fighters. The music represents the same change in the look and feel of the game, resulting in a score rife with drum beats and electronic synthesizers – about as far removed from the orchestral soundtrack featured in Hitman 2 as you could expect but equally as good. However it’s not just the music that stands out, as care and attention has been lavished upon every aspect in the sound department, from a variety of voices babbling native dialogue in the background to 47 excellent softly-spoken lines that suit the character perfectly.

      More info about shooters. If you think Blackhawk Down was a great game, you obviously are not a picky gamer. To Joint Ops credit, it is a cut above Blackhawk Down. However, as with all the Nova Logic games, the feel is not as smooth as the venerated UT2004. Controls feel clanky, and the animations are average. If you are a diehard Bf1942 fan, then don't pass this game up. However, if you are a dedicated shooter fan that likes a quality game like UT2004 or the more real variety like Rainbow Six, and America's Army then pass this game up.

      The other fantastic shooter coming up is Doom III. I got this from http://articles.dailytelefrag.com. The gameplay, which many first-person shooter veterans got accustomed to, is also subject to change. However, it won't be changed more than it will be necessary to plunge gamer into DOOM III world. Take this in-game moment for example: you pace along the corridor, recovering after a scuffle with zombies and all of a sudden notice a huge shadow materializing before your eyes (another advantage of the technological revolution behind the game -- lighting effects and true shadows allow for detecting enemies long before direct contact). Assuming you have run out ammo, you skip to the saving darkness and pray to shrink. Heavy steps approach and you behold giant monster, hellish hybrid of demon and robot. It takes a stroll down the corridor, then halts and slowly turns around, getting used to the smell. Its eyes are gleaming in dark (this moment gave me shivers). Luckily it didn't notice your presence and continues his walk, grumbling and scratching the floor covering with its metallic claws. "We provide certain freedom of choice, just as we do with the storyline", - says Jean Paul von Waveren, id Software's programmer. "Whether to jump out in a frenzy shooting spree or to evade enemies and go different way, saving ammo and health, is for player to decide."   Monsters in DOOM III, as I already mentioned, stun with their awesome graphical appearance and smooth animations (which cannot be conveyed by static screenshots). However, there's always a room for complaint: can it be another Unreal, where enemies are scarce but trained specially to wage prolonged duels with player? "Of course not", - comments id's Mal Blackwell. "This is DOOM! We are not going to mimic Serious Sam where player is exposed to relentless attacks by hordes of identical enemies. Monsters will be more than adequate, sometimes they'll attack in tens, sometimes they poke around alone. We want player not to be aware of what's behind the next door, so that he would be up to storm the front every second of play. DOOM III is all about pressure and terror." Charming! Doom's conception is alive, and it has risen onto a new level. But what hardware is required to render tens of highly detailed monsters simultaneously? "The trick is in the extensive use of bump-mapping," says Jim Dose as he winks. "The characters are not REALLY high-polygonal, but the bump-mapping provides proper picture. This is how we intended to cram tens of monsters onscreen without damaging performance. By the way, let me give you a piece of advice regarding hardware configuration: you won't see what DOOM's like on video cards below GeForce 3. With per-pixel lighting and bump-mapping turned off, you just won't see DOOM III. Yes, the game can be run on GeForce 1, but my urgent message is as follows: go buy GeForce 3 or better".   While talking on the plethora of monsters in DOOM III, Mal Blackwell mentioned that the game will incorporate a number of already recognized monsters (the movie exposed zombie, pinky demon, imp, flying skulls, and cyber-demon), and of course plenty of new creatures. However, some of the cast that made it from the first installments of Doom are totally renovated, as renowned imp (that disgusting brown ape casting fireballs) now looks as a transmuted chimp. Ugly salivating mug, hairy arms and habits of the primate. If you are closer than three meters at the beast, it would drop a curtsey, and then jump at you, trying to slit your throat open (however, its fireball skill remained untouched). "Yes, our animator Fred Nilsson is a pure genius", -- says Jim Dose. "He was previously working in Hollywood, and worked on "Shrek". His ability to inhale life into any incredible creature has long become a legend. We are very happy to have him working over DOOM III with us".   Yet another itchy question regards AI. Will monsters stick to the sheer numbers tactics? "Not quite so", Jean Paul Waveren comments. "We shall have various creatures, both stupid and smart, and they will perform differently. I can say our monsters are credible. What that means? Imagine yourself approaching a man on the street and asking him what time is it. You don't expect him to dance jig or recite Shakespeare's selected stanza. That's what our monsters are - they will act like real creatures. They won't hole up around the level or talk to their mates through radio. Their objective is to kill every living being, and your fear attracts them. That's their natural pattern of behavior, and they all attack in a different way, according to their savage ruses".   Another shocking information on DOOM III character cast. While talking to Mal Blackwell on the game's plot, I couldn't but pose a question on the probable introduction of NPCs. "Yes, there will be NPCs in DOOM III", - assured Mal. "They won't be many (look for yourself, how many survivors can there be given that hordes of blood-thirsty monsters are crawling around the Martian base?). However, on your way you will encounter characters whom you can interact with. They can even demand your help (like getting them food or killing a particular monster that occupied their residence), and reveal you a door to the secret room or give out valuable ammo in return. Actually, it's not a significant part of the game, and we need it to reinforce the game's credibility".   According to Mal's words, DOOM III will span around thirty levels (probably a bit more). They will be really huge, and will be constructed to convey the pressing atmosphere of fear and terror, where you oppose Evil and you have no idea what's there around the corner. "Building levels for DOOM III is a really hard work", - says Jim Dose. "The point is that we use a great deal of special effects, which previously were the cinema's privilege, like shadows and lights. This is why we must pay special attention to architecture details, decorating, sources of light, even furniture - as everything must serve our goal: scare the player as hell. This is where we get the most effect from our physics system, which is Jean Paul's domain".   Physical laws exploited in the game are aiming to be closer to reality than the reality seems to be. When you shoot shelves where boxes and lumber are stored, you can "see" bullet burst through the stuff, slam into the wall and rebound. The box hops with the impact, turns over and falls down on the floor. The scene looks terrific. Another striking example is shooting zombies at stairs. When you have used up the magazine for one of these meat bags, it would drop down and roll over downstairs, carefully mimicking the accurate evolutions of "real-life" corpse.   Moreover, according to Jim Dose, DOOM III won't be confined within narrow corridors and rectangular rooms of military base. Did they opt for the outdoor areas and huge sceneries of Mars? "Yes, that's right", - says Jim, - "we plan a number of outdoor levels. I'm not going to reveal you precise number of indoor and outdoor areas. Don't want to spoil the impression. Actually, implementing open-air levels is not our primary purpose. They won't be more than needed, and we are not willing to churn them out just because its flashy these days".   Last but not least point of Doom III is its multiplayer ingredient. What do we see there? "We are trying to create unforgettable and revolutionary singleplayer game", - Jim Dose says. "That's why we plan only a simple deathmatch for DOOM III. However, new modes of play are likely to appear afterwards, but I can't state anything for sure right now. Our primary and foremost objective is to create a stunning singleplayer experience, and we employ all possible and impossible technological attainments glued with immersive plot to achieve proper result".   Before I could put my eyes on DOOM III, I feared that the impression which formed after watching MacWorld Expo and GDC videos will vanish away. I was almost sure that my expectations to see a really scary and dismal horror game would be shattered. I thought I'd be presented with just another first person shooter. But it turned out that id's veterans are not trying to live up to the hype, they are going much further. DOOM III is not a next id's game. It is a true revolution, on a par with first Doom or intellectual upheaval of Half-Life. Jim Dose is thousand times right: DOOM III is precisely what Doom should be. It's time for a total upgrade and agonizing suspense for 2003.

      Weapons/Vehicles... No surprise: this game is gorgeous. The weapons are varied and allow for a tremendous amount of flexibility in combat. During the firefight, the player lured an enemy to the opposite side of a vehicle and then proceeded to use a repulsing-like weapon to roll to vehicle over the enemy.

      As you all now, the source-code of HL2 has been stolen. But a year after the attack, HL2 is nearly ready, it should come out in the summer.  This is a review from E3: A brief cinematic featuring G-Man fades into gameplay of Gordon Freeman stepping off of yet another train and into a processing station in a disturbing, dystopian world. After being led into a sinister interrogation room with a blood-soaked restraint chair, the scene changes to a dune buggy-like vehicle racing along a cliffside road, trying to avoid some sort of spherical attack bots. This is followed by a firefight with the stormtrooper-looking enemy soldiers, an arachnid tank and yet more vehicular combat in a gully.

      I bought FarCry a month ago, and it was great. The freedom you have is unbelievable. Plus you can reform the ground a bit, with something like a grenade and a rocket. Always wanted to shoot a heli out of the air while being chased by 5 men and 2 boats? Get it here...www.farcry.com
