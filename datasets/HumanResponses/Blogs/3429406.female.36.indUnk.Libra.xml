      I need to be needed.  Yes, I admit it.  It isn't easy to put it all out there, but it's the truth.  I am at my best when I feel needed.   But you can't be needed all the time.  Right now, my teenage son doesn't need me.  He tells me that all the time.  Both with his words and his actions.  Yet he does things to indicate that he still needs my guidance and my direction, and yes even my love.  But when I put those things out there they are rejected.  I am rejected.  And that hurts.    For the most part he makes good decisions and good choices about things.  But when he makes bad choices, he makes really bad choices and it's never a little thing.  And it's getting harder and harder to deal with.  He makes it very difficult for me to help him because he insists he doesn't need me.  So, do I stand by and let him fall?  Or do I keep catching him until I fall with him?  Is there such a thing as being needed too much?  That's where my pre-teenage daughter comes in.  She feels she can't do anything without me.  She is constantly up under me.  And while I love the fact that she even wants anything to do with me, it grates on my nerves after a while.  Sometimes she mothers me.  And yes, I'll admit, sometimes I enjoy it and let her.  But then it's time for me to be the mother once again.    I've got one very independent young man.  He likes to do things on his own and be his own person.  I am very proud of that and I love him.  But it's hard to handle not being needed.  And I've got a young lady who is just like me (in a lot of ways).  And I'm proud that she is caring and outgoing and I love her.  But it's hard with her because she is also a person who needs to be needed.  And I don't have a clue how to do that for her.  I wish now I had subscribed to that instruction manual when I had these kids, it just may have come in handy!

      So there I was, here I am.  Lost.  Again.  The fantasy of being daddy's little girl - gone.  The hope of winning his approval - gone.  The hope of seeing joy in his eyes when he looks at me - gone.  And the empty spot in my heart - bigger.  What was I to do?  Where was I to go?  It wasn't until he was gone that I realized that he was my rock.  I realized just how much I leaned on him, especially for my spiritual guidance.  As long as my dad was here, I was ok with God.  Funny, it doesn't work that way.  God doesn't have grandchildren, just children.  I fell apart.  I was like a sweater that had a thread that someone just kept pulling - I unraveled.  And I didn't know how to make it stop.    It was time to talk to God.  But how?  I felt so far away from Him.  I had treated Him like a distant friend - always there when I needed Him but just not close enough to talk to on a daily basis.  But that wasn't His fault, it was mine.  And I knew it.  I had looked at God like the great and powerful Oz, like the mighty God waiting for me to mess up so He can smite me with a lightening bolt and let me know I wasn't good enough.  How do you go to someone like that when you are broken and scared?  I needed to know.  I needed a new outlook on God.    "God, I need you"  was it as simple as that?  "Jesus I want you to be my friend, someone I can talk to in the good and in the bad"  It didn't happen instantaneously, or magically, or with some big bang.  It happened slowly, and quietly and most awesomely.  And it is still happening today because He isn't finished with me yet.

      Would a having a baby fill the void?  I thought so, I really did.  I was in a destructive relationship and I looked at having a baby as a way out.    I was gonna have a baby.  I was all grown up (or so I thought) and I was going to do this and do it right.  I went to my dad (the one who was my world, my everything) and shared this news with him.  The result was more rejection.  HE wasn't ready for me to have a baby!  HE wasn't ready to become a grandfather.  Hmmm, it was going to happen - ready or not.  I pushed the rejection down deep inside with all the other rejection, hurt, and pain.  Having felt like I was never good enough, I was scared that I would mess this mothering thing up too.  But I could never admit being scared.  I would just have to bury that fear and move on.  Mistakes, mistakes, and more mistakes.  Sometimes we learn from them.  But other times we don't and we keep repeating them over and over.  The more mistakes I made in life, the further away from my dad's love I was.  It was a downward spiral that I didn't know how to end.  Life went on and our relationship struggled.  He pushed and I pushed back.  We never pushed together in the same direction.  I made mistakes and hid them from his disapproving eyes.  I knew they were mistakes, I didn't care.  I was still searching to be loved, to feel loved.  He made mistakes and refuse to acknowledge them - he was still perfect.  For years I never told him how I felt.  I never told him how he hurt me.  I never told him how he meant the world to me.  We just existed.  And life went on.  Then one day the world came to a standstill.  My dad was facing death.  A sudden illness, emergency surgery, a stroke, and then a coma.  It was then that I decided enough was enough.  He had to know, I had to tell him.  I felt like such a coward standing at his bedside pouring out years of frustration and pain while he was in a coma.  He couldn't react, he couldn't yell, he couldn't tell me how much I failed him, he couldn't tell me I wasn't good enough.  Maybe that's why I did it that way.  All I wanted was to be daddy's little girl again.  All I wanted was to be loved by him, to have him be proud of me.  All I wanted was something I would never have.

      The first time I fell in love.  I was young, he was older.  He was my world.  He was just so perfect to me.    Then I grew up a little.  And the more I grew up the more imperfect he became.  Still, I could not let him go.  He was in control, total control.  I hated him and yet I loved him at the same time.  And I continued to grow up.  At one point in our relationship it was just him and I.  Day after day.  All our time shared by no one.  Or so I thought.  Then along came others.  They invaded our space, took him away from me little by little.  I resented that.  He hurt me by giving his love away.  I had to hurt him too.  I was still a child inside and didn't understand that you can love more than one at a time.  So, I sought to love another.  Someone he wouldn't approve of, someone like him in fact.  I tried to get him to notice that I was hurting, and he didn't.  I tried to get him to understand that I wanted things to be like they once were.  He tried to get me to understand that they could never go back to that.  I walked away.  I got on with my life.  Still seeking that first love's approval.  Never getting it.  I sought out others to love hoping they would fill the void I felt.  The hole in my heart just continued to grow.  The only things to fill it were rejection, shame, never feeling good enough.  I thought a baby would fill the void.  I thought if I just had a baby to love me unconditionally the hole would be filled.    Was it enough?  Find out next time.....

      Who am I?  The question has plagued me for the longest time.  I've always been someone's daughter, someone's niece.  Then I became someone's sister.  Then I was someone's mother.   I have always been someone's friend, but one day I became someone's bestest friend.  But who am I really?  I am all those things mentioned above but that still doesn't define who I am.  I look back on my life and realize that I have always tried to be what other people wanted me to be.  This led to not knowing what it was I wanted to be, who I wanted to be.    Now, as time passes and my oldest child enters high school and my youngest child is a middle schooler, I realize that my days of being a full time mom are quickly coming to an end.  One day they will be gone.  Then I will be left alone.    With the passing of my parents, I am no longer someone's daughter.  And with my siblings in other states I am a long distant sister.  And with my bestest friend in another state...........well it feels like another galaxy.    I don't fear being alone.  I just fear not knowing what role to assume.  I miss what I used to have, am uncertain of what lies ahead, and I do my best not to waste today.

      It's Sunday, June 27th.  I am in mourning.  My daughter would have turned 17 today. She never  even got a chance to see day one.  She was killed before she was even  born, her father saw to that.   I got up this morning, cleaned the house and decided to take a road  trip.  This trip would be made without my other two children, it would  just be me and the open road.  Where would I go?  I headed "home".  I  decided to take a trip north to Lake Michigan, to sit along the shore line  and enjoy the quiet.  Along the way I saw a Big Boy restaurant - oooh  had to stop.  Those that know me well know "I break for hot fudge ice  cream cake and Baskin Robbins"!  Now if they could just get the two of  those together.   Hmmmm.  I sat there in Big Boy's savoring every bite of hot fudge, chocolate  cake, and cookies and cream ice cream!  I sat there lost in thought about  my baby.  What would she have looked like?  I pictured, as I often  have, me brushing out her hair and putting it up.  I tried to picture her  becoming a teenager and a young woman.  It was difficult to do.  But  with every bite of my delicious dessert I felt the pain and emptiness fade  away.  I was reminded at some point of my other two children that I  have.  My son, now a teenager; and my daughter, a preteen.  I thought  about each of them growing and changing into the person they have now  become.  I replayed key events in each of their lives.  And I smiled.  I am  truly blessed.  While I mourn the loss of one, I celebrate the life of  two more.  God is good.  After I finished my dessert and my drive to lake Michigan I couldn't  wait to get home to my son and daughter.  It was a long trip back home  but the adventure was worth it.

       If I were to leave this earth today, would you miss me?    I've posed that question to a variety of people in my life this week.  The responses were all very interesting.  Funny, they all said they would miss me and yet I don't feel like they really would.  I guess that is my problem. . .my "feelings".  They can't be trusted you know.    A friend of mine, who was out of state on vacation, called me.  As we were talking I told her that I missed her and she asked if I was ok, that I didn't sound like myself.  I told her I felt like I was standing on a cliff with the sea slamming against the rocks below and I wanted to step off the cliff but I just couldn't.  She jokingly said I must be waiting for her to push me.  Yep, that's the kinda thing I need right now.  Someone to push me -  NOT .  Another close friend of mine answered my question with a one word answer:  leave.  I was floored.  I cannot describe what that did to me.  I almost didn't even read the rest of her e-mail.  In the end, I'm glad I did read the rest of her e-mail - it was positive and loving.  Some days I can't help but wonder what would really happen if I were to leave this earth suddenly.  In some ways I wish I could hang around afterwards and see what really happens.  I might be missed immediately but what happens six months down the road.  Have I really made a difference in people's lives or have I just existed for 30-some years?

      I am feeling very lost today.  Like the world is going on without me.    I feel like I'm standing on a cliff by the sea and the waves are  crashing into the rocks below me, calling to me.  I feel alone in a sea of people.  Like I'm invisible, no one sees me.  I feel small, very small.  Insignificant.  If I were to leave this earth today, would you miss me?  Have I touched your life somehow? Good or bad?  Would your life be different if you never knew me?  You'll never know how important these answers are to my life at this  very moment.    Loving, but not feeling loved.  Giving, but not feeling given to.  Alone, so very alone.

      America – the melting pot  I’ve heard it said that America is the melting pot of the world.  That makes me think of different colored pillar candles standing side by side inside of a big black kettle that is hanging from a tripod over an open fire.    As people came to America from other countries long ago they stood side by side yet they stood tall as a pillar and proud of the heritage they brought with them.    As people melted together with others they still held fast to the traditions of their heritage, thus bringing a ribbon of color into an otherwise single colored candle.  But as people from one nationality married people from other nationalities some of the traditions got so blended that there became less and less of a distinction and we were just “Americans”.    Think of the melting pot with the candles in it.  Blended together with ribbons of color (heritage) intertwining with each other, now melted to the point of one messy-colored candle.  Parent who only spoke the language of the old country had kids who were bi-lingual.  Then those kids one day became parents whose children only spoke English.  They heard enough of the “old language” from their parents and grandparents that they picked up on phrases and words but nothing to carry on a conversation with.  They then grew up and had kids (my generation) who never really knew the old language.    My great-grandparents (who only spoke Polish) were gone.  My grandfather (who was bi-lingual) was gone.  I barely remember my mother cursing in Polish when she was angry, but that’s all I had.  And now she is gone too.  What kind of legacy can I possibly leave to my kids?    My grandparents kept old family traditions but my parents fought to create their own family traditions and not hold fast to what they had growing up.  Now I have traditions that I really have no idea where they came from and as my kids as questions about why we do some of the things we do I find it hard to answer them.  Is it possible that we, as American’s, have “melted” so much that we don’t even know who we really are anymore?

      Something about old friends and new friends.  It is amazing that you don't have to give up one set for another.  God just creates a little more room in your heart for the new ones.  Gwenette - what can I say about her?  She's my best.  She is a pillar of faith, stronger than I ever imagine to be.  She has seen me stupid and not so stupid.  And loved me through it all.  She is my pillow, my cushion.  She is the soft, but not too soft one.    We never would have met if it hadn't been for God's directing me to a particular daycare where she just happened to work.  I ended up sending my kids there for only a week but in that time she and I just knew that it was a friendship meant to be.  As I moved on to find other daycare, we kept in touch.    She was the first one I called when my mother died.  She dropped everything for me.  She was headed to a wedding and called someone to take her own mother so she could spend the day with me helping me to prepare for the trip I needed to take.  I was so amazed that someone could care so much as to do that for me.  Those memories and the feelings that go with them will never leave me.  I really can't express how much our friendship means to me.  Claudia - you'd have to know her to appreciate her.  She is my bestest.  God brought us together in THE most amazing way.  There we were, both at church at a pie social.  He spoke to each of us to go and say hello to the other one.  And there we sat, questioning if He really meant us.  Finally the Holy Spirit was so plain and clear about it (I thought everyone could hear him telling me), I just had to go over and say hello.  But then what?  Well, He would have to take care of that.  And that He did.  He knew that right then we both needed each other and He literally put us in each other's paths.  We've been through so much together that I couldn't begin to write about it.  And I really wouldn't want a lot of it out there because it's a personal thing.  But suffice it to say that she and I rode the waves of life, taking turns holding each other's head above water.  Some of those waves were small caps - you could almost enjoy the ride.  Other waves were like hurricanes and we had to fight to stay above water.  But that's what friends are for, they carry you when you don't have the energy to even crawl by yourself.  Claudia's friendship is carried in the innermost part of my heart.  Words could never describe what she means to me.  She is more than a friend, she is my sister.  To make it even more special she is my chosen sister because God chose her for me.  I sit speechless with tears in my eyes when I think of all we've been through.  And for anyone that knows me, they know "speechless" isn't a word used often to describe me.    I have many other friends at many other levels but these four (the old and the new) are the best of the best.  And God is at the center of each of our relationships and that is what makes them work.  I love each and every one of them in a little different way from the other yet it's all from the heart.  If I can believe that God brought the right female friends into my life at the right moment in time, then why is it so hard to believe that He will bring the right man into my life?  I guess that's another blog in itself.......

      I have many different friends, all of whom have come to me at various stages of my life.  Some friends have floated in and out of my life and others stopped by and stayed a while.  Angie, Carol, Mischelle, Vivian and I were inseparable through high school.  They were there through the good times and the bad times of our teen years.  Life would have been different without them.  Funny, as I get older my memory fades from time to time, but never will I forget walking into ninth grade home economics class and seeing the four of them at a table.  The two junior highs in our town came together in one high school.  They were all from the other jr. high.  I really don't know what made them offer me a chair but they did.  It was the five of us from that moment on.  We each came from different backgrounds but one things we all had in common - the need to be needed.  As we graduated and promised to keep in touch always, something called life happened.  We all parted and went our own ways and yet I managed to think of them all often.    Angie and I stayed pretty close for about a year after high school, then we lost touch.  Vivian moved down south, got married and started a family.  Carol went on with her career and Mischelle did her own thing.  Time went on and we were all out there growing up.  And God was working in all of our lives even when we didn't realize it.  Sooner than we would have liked our ten year reunion was upon us.  That's it, we decided, we were all going to be together again.  The five of us, just like in high school, if just for one day.  Then tragedy happened.  Just six weeks before the reunion Mischelle was killed by a drunk driver.  Being seven months pregnant and having a five year old at home, this was hard to handle.  We all asked why and none of knew the reasons.  Yet God was working.  Not all of us could get together for the reunion but we all understood.  It was as if we all grew up a little more when Mischelle died.    Over the years Angie and I have stayed in touch (through the miracle of the internet).  And Vivian and I have found each other again too (through the miracle of living close to each other and not knowing it).  But most of all it was the miracle of God that has kept us going.  Something amazing happens when God brings people together.  Something life long, something binding.  I thank God for these two friends who have known me longer than I care to admit.  We've smiled together, we've cried together, we've clung to each other with the passing of our mothers and for two of us, our fathers.  Old friends have a special place in my heart.    Then the day came when they had to make room in there for two new friends. . . .

      Stop...Delay...Pause...Remain...Don't move...Stay...Hang around...Linger  wow!  The many ways to say "wait".  And waiting isn't easy.  So many times we are patient with God and we will wait on Him, as long as He works within our time frame.  he tells us that His time is not our time.  Yet we fret and we wonder if He realizes just how close we are to our deadline and that we need help NOW.  And yet He has it all under control.  Take my current job situation....  I got laid off two weeks before Christmas.  At first it was really nice, I needed the break.  Had time to enjoy my family.  Didn't have any money to go anywhere but that was okay.  I did my three job applications a week to fulfill my unemployment and didn't really worry about it.  Then it was April.  I was beginning to get a little concerned.  I stepped up the application process and decided I needed to look for a job full time.  Everyday I spent time filling out apps, searching jobs online, you get the idea.    Then it was May.  Okay, now I am REALLY concerned.  I didn't think it would take this much time to find a job.  I applied at all the fast food places in town, even they wouldn't hire me.  I was either over qualified and they thought I would get bored and quit, or I wasn't qualified enough.    I began to pray.  Ok, I realize I should have been doing this a little sooner but better late than never.  I felt like failure that I couldn't find a job and provide for my family.  But I couldn't stop looking because that would be the biggest failure of all.  People began to tell me that God had it all under control and in His time something would come along.  Okay.  Does God know that I only have a month left on unemployment?  I am beginning to panic.  Then one day, with only two weeks unemployment left, I go on yet another interview.  The next day they call me and offer me the job, and the next day I start work.  Not only is it a job that I really like, that is in my field, but the pay is more than I would have dreamed I could have gotten anywhere else.  But the best thing of all is that both my supervisor and the HR manager are Christians.  I see signs of other Christians throughout the plant as well.  I guess God DID have it all under control after all.  He was just waiting for me to apply to the place He wanted me to work.  Funny, I was waiting on Him to do SOMETHING and He was waiting on me to do my part.  Waiting.............it's never easy, but it's worth it.

      My sister is quirky.  She is unique.  She is a free spirit who thinks like no other.  My sister is 25.....and I am not.  I recently bought a car.  A new (ok, new to me) Cavalier.  It is cute and it is red and I look pretty good driving it (I think).  It is the first time I've bought a car on my own and the first time I've financed a vehicle (and I'm ALMOST 40).  Well, I called my sister to share this bit of exciting news with her.  I said, "Guess what I did this weekend?"  She replied, "Got a tattoo?  Got your belly button pierced?  Ran off and got married?"  Now for those of you who know me, well.....just laugh along with me on those things.  Ya know, none of them are me.  Somehow my little tidbit of news didn't compare with a tattoo, a belly button piercing, or running off and getting married.  But I told her anyway.  She smiled for me.  I love my sister.

      She was MY MOM  She may have been someone else's daughter She may have been someone else's wife She may have been someone else's sister She may have been someone else's ex-wife She may have been someone else's friend But she was MY MOM - and she's gone.  She was MY MOM - Doesn't that count for anything? Shouldn't it have been enough?  It wasn't enough to keep her here, it's never enough. She was MY MOM and I didn't appreciate her the way I should have, the way I could have instead I found ways to get back at her for hurting me as a child, for leaving me, for not being there.  She was MY MOM AND I WANT HER BACK.  But she isn't coming back, she'll never be coming back. It's been 29 years since she left me the first time, it's been 8 years today since she left me for the final time.  I thought I could deal with it by now.  I thought it would get easier with time.  This year is not easy though.  My dad's been gone 2 years now, by daughter's been gone 17 years, my mom's been gone 8 years now - and I want her back, I NEED her back.  There are things inside of me that have been left undone, broken, battered, bruised, torn apart...... Just one more day people watching at the mall. Just one more holiday of applying for JCPenny charge cards just to get that years Christmas glasses. Just one more morning chat over coffee at the little table in her little kitchen.  Just one more chance to call her and tell her I love her - an opportunity that passed me by, an opportunity that will never come again.  She was MY MOM - and I love her.

Just one more holiday of applying for JCPenny charge cards just to get that years Christmas glasses. Just one more morning chat over coffee at the little table in her little kitchen. Just one more chance to call her and tell her I love her - an opportunity that passed me by, an opportunity that will never come again.  She was MY MOM - and I love her.
