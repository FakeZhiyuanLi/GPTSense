      Ah the weekend is finally here. Not sure I am glad or not. The kids school year ends this week, well it's already ended for Rickey since he was suspended the last five days of school.   I guess I shoud put a lil info about myself in here, just incase someone stumbles across my blog.  I am a 39  year old housewife, dealing with thyroid disorder, panic disorder and a child with brain damage from lead. And one that wasnt affected as badly.  Rick and I met in 1985 and were married in 1987 and still to this day have a wonderful relationship.  There really is never a dull moment in my life, although I do piss and moan a lot that I am bored.  I am originally from upstate NY and now living in TN. I spent about 10 years hitch hiking around the USA and met Rick out in California.  Like I said earlier, I do tend to piss and moan a lot, but all in all I have a good life and tons to be thankful for.  So that in a nutshell is me :)

I am going nuts trying to get a GMail account, but no luck yet...would be totally awesome to be at the start of something big..and I am totally tired of yahell...have used them for so many years, but they have been acting up as of late.  My depression was pretty bad the last few days..but seems to be lifting..I still think I dont get my pms till after my period..whats up with that? I mean the week before is usually my best time..but the week after...look out!! Leave it to me to mess that up. I didnt even cry today!! *yay* me LOL  Its been aweful hot here today..the humidity is really bad...I miss california's heat when it gets like this...heck out there I could walk to the store even when it hit 100*...here when it hits 80* I die!!!  Well anyway, I had a pretty good day and think tomorrow will be good too :)
