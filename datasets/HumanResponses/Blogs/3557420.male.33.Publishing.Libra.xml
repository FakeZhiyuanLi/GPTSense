      Beware of old swords and other sharp weapons. Some people believe these old things are possessed by guardian spirits, or other unseen beings. Others say the essence or spirit of the original owners remain as residue on the weapons.  A friend of mine who has a strange fascination with swords, bought an old samurai sword from a shop somewhere up north. It was a very normal looking sword, nothing special, certainly nothing to suggest anything supernatural. But what happened to him later seemed to prove otherwise.  From the first day he brought the sword home and displayed it in his living room, he had trouble sleeping at night. Every time he closed his eyes and was about to doze off, he would snap back awake for no reason at all.  Later, it got worse.  After a few weeks, he began to feel something was there with him every night. When he was about to fall asleep, he would feel something or someone come at him, and he would immediately open his eyes and remain awake. He felt as if something would try to attack him if he closed his eyes.  Sure enough, a week later, he began to see something in his bedroom. The lights would be off, the room would be in complete darkness, but he would see this thing that was blacker than the darkness. It would lunge at him and his heart would beat really fast, as if it would pound out of his chest. He was stricken with fear every night, unable to sleep, too afraid to turn off the lights. Sometimes, he felt the thing choke him, other times he would just feel this terrible, suffocating fear.  Soon, his outward appearance began to resemble that of a zombie's, bags under his eyes, general health failing. He still didn't put two and two together to figure out that perhaps it was because of the sword that these horrible things were happening to him.  Then, one day, he decided to have a closer look at his purchase.  The sword had a strange smell. "It had a strange, leathery odour that I can't quite explain," was how he described it. As if that was not enough, there was a button on the handle of the sword which, when pushed, released a smaller blade. After seeing this, my friend was convinced that something was definitely not right about the sword.  He decided to sell it to an old friend. And sure enough, once the sword was out of his hands, everything went back to normal. His nights were peaceful, he could sleep soundly without any kind of disturbance, and the room began to feel devoid of any otherworldly presence.  Peculiarly enough, his friend who bought the sword did not experience anything out of the ordinary.  And you would think my friend had learned his lesson. But no. A few months ago, he went to Penang and bought another samurai sword.  But this time, nothing strange happened.  Some people just never learn.

      Some good news came in the beginning of the week. My second script,  Offerings , has been greenlighted for production.  My director, T, and I are on the lookout now for potential actors, and a Director of Photography. It's an exciting time, to have finally found backing for a professional, or at least semi-professional, project. And all this while, our first short film,  Seeing Things , is still in the cutting room.  Love, loss, longing, food, lots of food ... and ghosts. That's  Offerings  in a nutshell. It's going to be a very visual film, if all goes as planned. There is only one scene of dialogue. The rest of the time, the actors will have to work extremely hard to get the story across purely by gestures and expressions.  We had originally planned for the shoot to be sometime in July, but we realised something that stopped us dead in our tracks. The month from July to August is the Month Of The Hungry Ghosts. The nature of the story in  Offerings  has something to do with the Hungry Ghost Festival, and we had to think hard about whether we should risk it - not only the actors and crew, but the project as a whole.  But I did some research and found the exact period of the Hungry Ghost Month, and realised we could, in fact, shoot the film before the festival begins. When I related this problem to a friend, she suggested we should go ahead and the whole thing could work to our advantage when it comes to publicity.  Yes, T and I are not very superstitious, but the rest of the crew ... we didn't think we would want to risk  them .  Pre-production begins now, and we're keeping our fingers crossed. But we're also keeping our feet on the ground. We're not superstitious, but well, just in case.  You never know.

      Last weekend, I saw  urlLink Ingmar Bergman 's horror film,  urlLink  Hour Of The Wolf  . Not everyone's cup of tea, to say the least,  HOTW  is really a very disturbing, highly intriguing horror film that, like all of Bergman's films, delves deeply into the disintegrating psyche of its main protagonist.  An artist and his wife move to an island, where stands a castle that houses some rather peculiar inhabitants. The artist, played by Max von Sydow, is slowly going mad, and his wife, played by Bergman regular Liv Ullman, is aware of it and tries her very best to keep him from losing his mind. But gradually, she starts losing him to the weird family that lives in the castle. Among them is an old woman whose face comes off when she takes off her hat.  Very soon, the wife also begins to share her husband's psychosis, as she encounters the demons and vampires from the castle, who may or may not be just figments of the artist's imagination and fragmented mind. A Bergman film wouldn't be complete without an exploration of the self, of being and of existence. The wife wonders whether it is true that if a couple live together for long enough, they would become of one mind, and also begin to resemble each other in appearance.  The film is heavily influenced by German expressionism in its use of shadows and architecture, while the ending has a very slight tinge of the Hammer horror tradition.  What intrigues me the most is the title of the film. The "hour of the wolf" is the time between 3am and 4am, when nightmares creep into the dreams of those asleep, when those awake are plagued by worries and depression. It is the hour when most people die, and the hour when most babies are born. In the film, the protagonist obstinately stays awake until dawn, and forces his wife to accompany him, because he fears what the hour of the wolf would bring him.  I have no idea where this idea of the hour of the wolf comes from, but I remember vaguely that it has something to do with Swedish folklore. I have tried looking for an explanation, but have found none (perhaps whoever is reading care to enlighten me on it).  If you have read my previous post ("In the darkened halls of a cursed dwelling") you would know that during my time living in a haunted house, my sister used to see a dark figure come into her room at the same moment every night - at 3am, the hour of the wolf. Perhaps there is some truth to the legend then.  Nowadays, although my sister works at home till late in the night, she never stays awake alone past 3am. She has encountered so many mysterious things at that hour, and it has scared her so much that she no longer has the courage to stay up, unlike the von Sydow character in the movie.  She related to me once, what she saw at her apartment at 3am. She was working in the living room as usual, and her husband had gone to bed. She heard footsteps, as if someone was pacing up and down the corridor outside. It was a very strange pacing, as if the person (or whatever it was) was waiting for something.  My sister looked through the foot of the front door, and saw the shadow of that person's feet, and something else. She saw a white, flowing robe. Now, my sister has had many experiences like this one, and it has come to a point where she can tell if it is something supernatural. She has had many visitations in the night. The fact that the hairs on the back of her neck stood on end indicated that this was no ordinary person pacing outside her apartment. Fearing the worst, she quickly turned out all the lights and hurried into her bedroom.  I have also heard other tales from friends who say their dogs bark in terrible fear at that hour. One colleague related how she had heard her dog barking furiously in the front lawn. She opened the front door to see what was agitating the dog, and saw a strange woman in a black robe slowly walking by her front gate. She said the woman had a piercing, angry expression. But being unafraid, my friend stared the woman down, and eventually the woman just walked away.  So, beware. Do not stay awake into the hour of the wolf. You never know what's waiting in the shadows for you.

      Well, Anonymous, this kind of argument loops over itself after a while, because I can also say the same: if you don't like what I write, then don't continue reading.  But that's not my point. When you put something out there to be accessed by the public, then get ready for some backlash if it's not good. If it's not meant for the public, then create limited access (ie. for members only, etc). Or like Liz's pet blog, it is clearly for fun (hey, i enjoy that kind of blogs, too). Liz's other  urlLink book review blog  is interesting and informative - anything and everything about books. And Dina's blog is just so damn hilarious, even when she's just writing about her braces! Some blogs may be journals, but they contain life lessons.  But there are others that are pointless and completely self-important. Those are the ones that piss me off. "Condemning other people's blogs"? Note that I didn't even name those blogs nor link them. Which means it is only my opinion, and others will have their own opinions about those same blogs, so I don't need to put examples and ram my opinion down other people's throats. But you, on the other hand, clearly do not tolerate differences in opinion. (And I said I hate MOST blogs, not ALL blogs, sheesh.)  And if you read carefully what I wrote, you'll see that I never praised my own blog or placed it in the stratosphere. I said I will try my best to make it interesting. That's what those rules are about: to keep me in check. Which means I am well aware that I am fallible, too.  When I decided to write the Manifesto, I knew I would be open to criticisms. Heck, when I started the blog, I was ready for potshots. (HIT ME! HIT ME! Adoi!)  And so should you.  The bottom line is, are we not to criticise anything and instead, pretend everything is rosy and beautiful? If we cannot accept criticism, how do we improve? How do we know where we went wrong and what to fix? (Stay tuned for an upcoming rant about this.)  What you're basically saying is that if we are bloggers ourselves, we should not criticise other blogs. If we are writers, we should not criticise other books; if we are painters, we should not criticise other artowrks; if we are accountants, we should not criticise other balance sheets. (Well, you get the drift.) Otherwise we would "masuk bakul, angkat sendiri"? Think about what you're saying.  But thanks for your comment anyway, and I sincerely hope you will return to The Clouded Moon. The shadows have been pining for you.  Now, back to the scary stuff!

      I must confess, I hate most blogs. Many are pointless and uninteresting, self-indulgent even. For a long time, I resisted the temptation of starting my own blog, for fear of falling into the same trap. Why do people start blogs that don't even try to entertain or inform?  One day, at an assignment, I met a friend whom I had not seen for a long time. While we were having lunch, we started talking about a mutual friend, Dina, whom both of us had not seen for a while.  "Have you been following Dina's blog?" said my friend.  "What? She has a blog too? Seems like everyone has one these days," I said.  "Yah, but Dina's is very funny and interesting."  OK, I made it a point to check out  urlLink The Gongkapas Times  that very night. And for once, I was entertained by a blog!  It was then that I started feeling the desire to blog again (I have another blog which I have abandoned because it became pointless!). But what the hell could I write about? I definitely wasn't going to write about my everyday life! There are already too many of those kinds of blogs, and most are as boring as drying paint.  And then, while on Yahoo Messenger with Dina, it hit me.  A horror blog!  Shit, why the hell not? I have tonnes of horror stories, and there is nothing that interests me more than ghouls, monsters and seeing dead people! And then Dina suggested, why not also write about my filmmaking experience?  Cool! That way, the blog won't stay in one form or shape. But there was still one thing: there had to be rules. Rules to keep me in check, so that the blog won't go astray.  Thus was born The Clouded Moon Manifesto. Hell, in the last couple of weeks, I've been enjoying this blogging business. So far, so good. Let's see where we can go with this.     THE CLOUDED MOON MANIFESTO    1. This blog shall remain true to the spirit of its inspiration: the Gothic manifestation of such shadows, architecture and foreboding of German Expressionism, Edgar Allan Poe, HP Lovecraft and Hammer Horror. Which means I get to be as melodramatic and pretentious as I want.  2. This blog shall attempt at all costs to be as entertaining and informative as its blogger's human capabilities will allow. Which means I have to be more interesting than a piece of cotton.  3. This blog shall refrain from becoming too self-indulgent. Which means I shall not write about my pet, or my belly button, or my rubber dolly, or my ingrown toenail.  4. However, this blog shall also remain partly a journal of my filmmaking experiences, which may seem to be in conflict with Rule No. 3, but hey, like Antonioni's Blow-Up, it's all a matter of perspective and perception. I see it as imparting information and advice to other fellow budding filmmakers, and if you disagree, you're a wanker. Ahem.  5. But this blog shall, first and foremost, be about all things that go bump in the night, regardless whether they are true or otherwise. We are not here in pursuit of the truth. Leave that to the science and religion blogs. Or the OJ Simpson blog. Or the ... er, whatever.

       While working on the first draft ...   "So what are we going to do?" I said to my director, T. "How are we going to start making films?"  "Don't worry," he said in his low, Brando-wannabe voice. "I want to start with something small. Just as a dry-run. I've been out of practice for so long."  OK, I said, I will write something small and easy to shoot.  Weeks later, I still had nothing. I had finished a script which everyone loved, surprisingly. But T felt he wasn't ready to shoot that one until he has had some practice to get back on his directing feet.  Meanwhile, the ready script,  Offerings , was being thrown around a bit, as we fished for prospective investors. One producer had already expressed interest in it, set out a plan for the future, and budgeted the entire production. That was the problem. The budget was too big, and T got cold feet, doubting his own abilities, wondering if he could pull it off with a rusty directing hand. If he failed, it would all be over for him.  He decided to decline the offer. I was a little disappointed at first, because no one else would ever give us such a budget to fool around with. But later, I came to realise that T was probably right. Hell, we only get to go around this block once. So, let's better do it right.  The producer, meanwhile, was still after the script, but I had originally written it for T, and I had my word to keep. I had to keep in mind that this industry is an industry of ideas, and ideas are easily stolen. Therefore, we need to build trust. I couldn't go back on my word. I shouldn't.   Offerings  was T's. But I didn't want to burn my bridges. So I agreed to write another script for that producer.  Then, one night, a sudden inspiration. I had been toying with the idea in my head all day. Finally, at 11pm, I was ready to write it all out. Two hours later, at 1am, it was completed. I emailed the script to T. Half an hour later, he SMSed me then called me up, excited like a little girl!  "I want to shoot this! It's mine!!!" he exclaimed down the line.  "It's yours, man," I said. "You said you needed something short and sweet to practise on, so here it is."  Just a few weeks ago, we wrapped, after shooting over three weekends stretched over a period of two months. We were like the Seven Samurai, we started out with a crew of about seven or eight. By the time we finished, we had a crew of only three. The rest had abandoned us! Talk about guerrilla filmmaking!  The result:  Seeing Things , a horror-scifi-comedy-noir-revenge-murder tale. Seven to eight minutes. Our first effort. Not great, but still something.  T is in the midst of cutting it now. As I write this, he is probably in the editing suite, looking through the rushes.  Yeah, right.  Knowing him, he's more likely in his recliner, munching junk food and watching some classic samurai flick. That bum!  "So, what are we going to do? How are we going to start making films?"  Famous first words.  Famous answer: Get off your fat ass and just do something!   (the adventure continues)

      Late night. A phone conversation. My friend Dina.  I was checking someone's credentials, and needed her to confirm some facts.  Out of nowhere, Dina exclaimed: "Hey, do you know about the haunted painting on eBay?"  Er, no, I didn't. But sounds good.  "Yeah, apparently people who looked at it all fell dead or seriously ill."  Wow. Sounds terrific. My interest was definitely piqued. But where the hell can I see it?  And then came the URL:  urlLink www.surfingtheapocalypse.com/haunted_painting.html   With the miracle of broadband, I logged onto the Net while staying on the line with Dina. I typed in the URL.  Big mistake.  The picture that greeted me was creepy. The story that followed was even worse. Just my kind of stuff.  After chatting with Dina about some ghostly experience someone she knew had recently encountered, I hung up the phone and began to read the webpage.   It's alive!   By the time I finished reading about the Haunted Painting, it was way past midnight. The house was all quiet, the lights were off, save for the one in my bedroom. It was time to be afraid. Very afraid.  The painting is called Hands Resist Him. If by now you've clicked on the link, you know what the painting looks like. If not, then it depicts a very strange-looking boy and a girl who seems to be a broken puppet with no eyes. Behind these two figures is a large window, and behind the window, it is pitch black. But in the darkness are many pairs of disembodied hands reaching out towards the window. And in the sky is a black moon.  Very Gothic. Very weird. Very disconcerting.  The story has it that a couple bought the painting from someone who had found it abandoned behind an old brewery. They put the painting in their children's room, but every night, the kids complain that the two figures in the painting came alive and argued with each other. One of the children also claimed the puppet girl stepped out of the painting.  The couple then decided to put a motion-capture camera in the room. If you go to the website, you can see a photo of what was captured by the camera, although it looks more like a trick of the light.  The children were so disturbed that the couple decided to put the painting up for auction at eBay. And thus began one of the most interesting urban legends.  Or is it just an urban legend?  Some people who viewed the painting online have claimed that they fell terribly ill, or had strange visitations in the night. But the person who finally bought the painting has reported nothing out of the ordinary so far.  The artist himself, Bill Stoneham, is still alive and he tells an even more interesting story about the painting at his website  urlLink http://www.stonehamstudios.com/ . He explains that the boy in the painting is himself when he was five, the window is a thin veil between waking and dreaming, the hands are "other lives," and the girl is the boy's guide. Don't ask me what the hell it all means.  Stoneham also claims the owner of the gallery where the painting was displayed and the LA Times critic who reviewed the show were both dead within a year of the show. Yikes.  Says Stoneham: "I'm sure it was coincidence, but some of what I paint resonates in other people, opening the inner door, or basement. By the way, I still have no idea what happened to the character actor (whose name escapes me) that bought the painting at the show, or how it ended up abandoned in a building, though I could speculate."  Being an unbeliever and a skeptic of widespread mania such as this, I decided to test the painting out on several people.   Da Vinci would be proud   The first thing I did was to immediately log on to the Yahoo Chat Movies Room, The Visitor's favourite haunt. I typed the URL in the room several times to make sure all my friends got to view the painting. The reactions varied - there were those who were totally spooked, those who couldn't care less and those who were too chickenshit to click on the link.  One guy claimed, in a Private Message to me, that he felt strange. Right.  We made jokes all night. Some of us got on the mic and made gurgling sounds, some disappeared from the chat room and pretended to be dead.  But when it was time for bed, when I had switched off all the lights, then I realised how spooked I really was. I kept waking up and looking at my computer to see if the little girl was there. For the next two nights, everywhere I turned, I imagined the boy and the little girl there. The power of suggestion. How effective it is.  The next day, I posted the link on the office internal messaging system. Same reactions. One guy sent a message saying: "So? What's so scary?" Smart-ass. I bet he soiled his pants that night.  Later, I got our art critic to look at the painting. She was all smiles and excitement when I told her the painting was haunted. But when she took her first look, her expression changed. She had a disturbed look on her face. The first thing she said was: "There's something not right about this painting."  Woah. Wait a minute.I thought it was all a hoax to fetch a good price on eBay. Shit, does this mean I'm going to die? Is the little girl going to climb out of my computer in  urlLink seven days  unless I show the painting to someone else?  Here is her explanation. The boy's body is asymmetrical, his shoulders are not on the same level, and his elbows are also like that. The shadows on him are all wrong. This gives an illusion of movement. That explains why the couple's children thought the figures in the painting moved.  My critic friend used Da Vinci's Mona Lisa as an example. The subject is deliberately asymmetrical, and the background behind her are different on both sides of her. This gives the impression that her gaze follows us wherever we go. It's all mathematical. You can read some stuff about the Mona Lisa  urlLink here .  Now comes the disturbing part.   Dreams and inner senses   When an artist creates a work of art, sometimes they unwittingly become channels for something beyond the physical world. Read what Bill Stoneham said above.  My art critic friend found the painting very disturbing for the very fact that Stoneham had inlcuded a lot of powerful symbols in it. The most outstanding feature is the disembodied hands behind the window. In art, hands are very powerful symbols, especially the palm. Buddhist monks apparently have to train for 12 years and go through several tests before they are allowed to paint the Buddha's Palm. In most paintings of religious figures, the palms are always upturned or outward-facing.  The other thing is that the eyes of both the figures in the painting are unseen. The girl even has empty eye sockets. And as you know, the eyes are the windows to the soul. Also, the boy has a very adult expression on his face and looks more like an older person than a boy.  And some people have noted that the black moon is a symbol of the Apocalypse, the end of the world.  My critic friend said the artist probably went through a very hard time when he was a child, hence the whole mood of the painting. Had he channelled something from the Other Side while painting? Some force from the Netherworld?  Stoneham has also done a sequel to Hands Resist Him, called Resistance At The Threshold. You can view it at his  urlLink website . It is a much happier painting. There is brihgt sunlight, the artist is an old man now, and the puppet girl is all broken and hung on the wall. It seems like the artist has finally overcome whatever hardship or dark times in his life.  What do you think?   (note: btw, nothing strange happened since the first day I viewed the painting ... except that when writing this post, I tried to preview it, but an error occurred on the page ... oh boy)

       Remember, this is only the first draft   Desolation, alienation, dehumanisation. These are the elements that inspired my first feature script, The Visitor.  We have come so far as human beings, but what really have we achieved? Have we really made ourselves any better? Or have we become more blindsided to certain things?  The next time you're out on the streets, take a good look around you. You'd be surprised at all the things you missed out on before, even though they've been there right in front of you all your life. Pay attention to the littlest details. Allow what you see to inspire feelings in you, be they negative or positive.  Largely inspired by  urlLink Pulse (Kairo) , the Japanese techno-horror film by  urlLink Kiyoshi Kurosawa , The Visitor is my attempt at exploring the dehumanised condition we experience in this fast-moving, money-driven world.  The spark came one late night, while lying in bed, unable to sleep. An image, it always starts with a single, unforgettable image. Then the rest followed. I toyed with The Idea for a long while, unable to move forward. All the while I worked on other short scripts, little bursts of inspiration that slowly took bigger shape.  Nothing came through until I had the good luck of meeting a young film editor who expressed interest in The Idea and shared a common vision of how we wanted to make films. At a mutual friend's house, we watched Pulse. Scared shitless, we talked some more about The Idea.  Over the next few weeks, we discussed it some more, and The Idea grew and grew and grew. Our talks delved into the sociological, the psychological, the metaphysical, the philosophical. It was getting richer. The big question was: Could I handle it? Was I good enough?  Hell, I took the dive anyway. Now, The Visitor is about halfway done. It's not looking great by any measure, but it is slowly working itself out.  And I keep telling myself: This is only the first draft.  (to be cont'd)

      And so, my family and I lived in the haunted shophouse for almost 26 years. Strangely enough, during all that time, I had never encountered a single ghost. The rest of my family did, but somehow I was spared. Maybe I just don't have the Eyes, as they say. Lucky me.  But I can recall when I was young, that I constantly felt depressed. At times, I found my actions somehow beyond my control, as if something was guiding me to destroy my own life little by little. It was extremely strange, difficult to explain. And whenever I was alone in the house at night, I would feel this terrible, constricting fear. I remember whenever I was left by myself, I would sit very still in front of the TV, my back against the wall, too frightened to move, too scared to even go to the bathroom. The thing that frightened me the most was the long corridor leading from the living room to the front door. At night, that corridor was darker than hell.  Remember that I was young at the time, and no one told me about the hauntings. Yet, I would always imagine seeing something appearing along that corridor, walking slowly towards me. Or worse, I would imagine a figure coming out of my parents' room, that troubled room along the corridor. I would always remain unmoving, eyes fixed on the TV, until everyone got home.  I never understood why I was so scared.   Unexplained illness   My mother, my poor mother, got it the worst. During all the years we lived in that shophouse, we saw my mother's health gradually get worse. She became weaker and weaker, dark bags under her eyes, constantly looking tired and worn out.  My father and her would come home from work and in the evenings and nights, do nothing but sit in their room, the two of them alone, sometimes not talking and staring into space. They were always depressed, unhappy, worried, sometimes for no good reason at all.  I cannot remember exactly how many times my mother fell seriously ill. She would complain of dizziness and would throw up so many times that she became too weak to even get out of bed. It was like she was on the verge of death. The doctors could not figure out what was wrong with her. They suspected it was her diabetes and hypertension, gave her medication, put her on drip for a few days, and she would return home normal again. And then it would happen again months later. If she did not fall ill, she would constantly feel lethargic. I remember waking up in the middle of the night, hearing her throw up, and thinking "Oh no, here we go again," fearfully wondering if it would be the last time.  During those years too, I hardly did well in anything. I gradually did worse in my studies, until it came to a point when I decided to leave my studies and take up a job. Everytime I made money, it would all trickle away somehow. My parents' savings which were to pay for my education abroad, were all used up for my mother's medications. Nothing ever went well.  Sometime in 2000, after so many years of suffering, my parents were convinced by my sister and her husband to go back to Church. It was then that the biggest, most frightening revelation came to us.   The thing on the wall   After my parents re-embraced the Catholic faith, their health improved tremendously, especially so for my mother. When before, she looked depressed and lethargic all the time, she regained her strength considerably and looked much happier than we had ever seen her. She did fall ill one more time, but even then, the doctors managed to pinpoint the problem. It was her cholesterol level, which was rocketing to a dangerous high. Made us wonder why it took so long for the doctors to figure that out. With the symptoms and the cause recognised, it was fairly easy to treat my mother then.  My parents also stopped moping aimlessly around the house, spent more of their time in the living room instead of in that room, engaged in lively chatter or enjoying a TV show.  By 2001, I found a well-paying job and was suddenly able to save some money. After all the years of working, I found I barely had any savings! By the end of 2001, we decided we would move to a better home. But it wasn't without a lot of convincing that we decided to take that step.  Firstly, we had new and rather uncouth neighbours. And we had a new landlord who raised the rent twofold. Secondly, the neighbourhood was turning bad. One Saturday morning, while I was asleep in my room, someone forced the front door, broke in, and stole my mobile phone which was lying on the living room table. Luckily, I wasn't killed!  We were so shocked that after so many years in that shophouse, such a thing happened. We suspected it was the new neighbours, but we didn't have proof. The new landlord could care less about our plight when we brought it to his attention.  That was the last straw for us. Well, at least for my mother and I. My father still refused to move out because he was worried that the rent anywhere else would be much more expensive and I might not be able to afford it. I don't know if you, dear Reader, believe in any kind of Divine Power or Divine Plan. But the way things happened, it was difficult for my family to gainsay that there was some kind of Intervention.  We finally found a place somewhere nearby, for a reasonable monthly rent too. The single-storey house belongs to my father's ex-colleague, who kindly offered us a very special rate. Still, my father was not convinced enough to take up the offer.  He had to learn the hard way.  Now, my father loved to read in the evenings. He would sit on an armchair in my parent's room, back against a wall, facing the opposite wall. Now, against the wall opposite the armchair is a rather large wooden shelf that stood almost to waist length. Adjacent to that shelf and wall is a large closet with a tall mirror. Every morning, that is where all of us go to get ready for work, to change and freshen up.  One night, my father sat in his favourite spot to read. After a few minutes, he looked up to give his eyes a rest. For a moment, he thought he had seen something on the wall opposite. He got up and went for a closer scrutiny. What he saw frightened him so much that he immediately agreed to move out in a week's time. And he didn't tell us why or what he saw until a week after we moved into the new house.  And when he told us, my mother and I were so creeped out that we could not sleep the whole night.  Now, you know how over the years, the old layer of paint on a wall fades away to reveal what was previously underneath. My father saw a drawing on the wall - someone had sketched a Chinese coffin in white paint.  A drawing like that is one of the most powerful curses anyone could put on a house. It means death to anyone who lives there. Miraculously, my family and I survived through all those years, but not without tremendous difficulties and obstacles.  Suddenly, we understood what had been going on all those years, why we were always broke, why there was always illness and unhappiness.  And then we wondered why we hadn't seen that drawing since it clearly had been there for a long time, and the top layer of paint had faded away a long time ago. I remember seeing some white lines but never really noticed what they were. Or was it the power of the hex that prevented all of us from seeing it? It's certainly difficult for me to negate that, since I went up to that wall every morning, sometimes even looking at it up close, yet never seeing what was really there. Eyes wide shut.  Even when we were moving, when we had cleared that room of all the furniture, we didn't even see it then, when the wall was all bare.  A day after my father told us about the drawing, I suddenly remembered that I had taken a photograph of my mother sitting at the doorway of the room. I quickly looked for that photo to see if the drawing was visible in it. It was.  Right there behind my mother was the wall, and on the wall was the dreaded drawing of the coffin. I still have that photo.  Now, in this new blessed house, we are all much happier, our lives much more peaceful than during those 26 years. Looking back, we're all surprised at how we survived through all the hardships. We thank God every day for that.  Sometimes, I still dream of that shophouse. On dark, quiet nights, in those moments of dreaming, I see that house, I see that room, and it is like being back in those haunted years. But even so, I do not see the drawing. Even in dreams and in knowing, it remains clouded.  But I am not afraid anymore. I know that my family's Faith protects us and God watches over us now.  Back to the question: Do I believe?  I don't know; I don't have a clear answer. But I do believe that there are things we cannot explain, things we cannot understand or fathom. Things that tap us on the shoulder when we least expect it, making us turn around and, facing it, see our deepest fears.  The most important thing, I guess, is how you deal with it.

      There is one question everyone hardly asks.  "Do you believe in ghosts?"  Whenever one is about to be engaged in a discussion about religion, more often than not, the question that forebears everything is: "Do you believe in God?"  A discussion about the supernatural is never preceded by the obvious question. Rather, it is assumed that everyone within earshot is a believer. Until someone offers a revelation as to the negative.  But is there really an answer to that question? I ask so because of one thing:  I lived in a haunted house for over 20 years.  In fact, I grew up in it. Which maybe explains why I continue to be frightened yet deeply fascinated by all things supernatural. Yet till today, I still cannot find the answer to that question: "Do I believe?"   How it began   Almost 26 years ago, my family moved into a shophouse. It looked innocuous enough - two bedrooms, one bathroom. Just nice for a family of four - me, my elder sister and my parents. But what awaited us was stranger than what our collective imagination could have produced.  I don't remember how long it was before the first incident began. My mother saw a figure moving about the house in the night. And that was just the mildest of incidents. A slow start, if you like.  My parents used to sleep in one room while my sis and I would share the other. The room my parents occupied was situated along a long corridor that leads to the kitchen and bathroom, and ultimately the front door. It has a window that looks out into the corridor.  One night, my father saw someone walking along the corridor in the dark. In his sleepiness, he assumed it was my mother, until she told him the next day that she never did such a thing. (And it certainly wasn't me sneaking off to the bathroom to whack off! I was too young then.)  Of course, by then, my parents suspected something was amiss. And the next night confirmed it when my father woke up in the night and saw someone peering through the window!  Sometime in the next few months, or even years, my parents identified the figure as a woman wearing a red dress. Now if you're well-versed in the supernatural, you'd know that a woman in red spells big trouble. It is a vengeful spirit.  Of course, us kids being young, our parents did not tell us any of these things. But my sister possesses the gift of The Eye, and soon she too began to have some of the most frightening visitations in the night. Over the course of a few years, somehow, my parents vacated their room and slept with me in the other room, while my sister occupied theirs. My parents kept an oil lamp in each room, to keep us kids from being afraid of the dark. They also believed that a house should not be left entirely in the dark and that there should always be some light at all times.  But every night, at 3am, my sister would see a dark figure come into her room and blow out the lamp. Without fail. The final straw was when the figure came right up to the side of her bed and peered down at her. She decided to get the hell out of there.  After that, it was back to the old arrangement - my parents back in their room and my sister and I in the other.  Of course, naturally by now, you're asking why we didn't just move out. The answer is simple. We were piss poor, and could not afford any other dwelling. And the rent was especially low for that shophouse (yah, we wondered why).  It was then that my mother recalled how some folks who had lived in the same block had advised her against renting that particular apartment. When she queried them on the reason, they simply said the plumbing was not good.  Knowing something was definitely not right about the house, she carried out her own sleuthing and soon came upon the real story.  A few years before we moved in, a young man and his wife were the occupants. One day, the wife came home and stumbled upon the man in bed with another woman. She stormed out of the house, and later killed herself in another place. The woman's parents were so devastated and infuriated, they buried her in a red dress, hoping she would return to exact revenge on her unfaithful husband. And sure enough, she did.  The man was so haunted, he finally sought the help of a medium, who advised him to place a small prayer altar in the room where he slept, and some blessed yellow papers on the wall. He did as he was told, and found peace again.  And guess what my mother did.  She recalled that when she inspected the empty apartment shortly before we moved in, there was indeed a small prayer altar in the room that would become my parents', and that there were Taoist yellow papers hanging on the wall. Right before we moved in, she tore down the yellow papers and, along with the altar, burned them.  Smart move.  Over the years, we continued to live there, and we encountered less and less supernatural incidents as time went on. We were Catholics, then we were Hindus, then we were Buddhists, and a little more than three years ago, my parents went back to Church. My sister had since married and moved out.  Three years ago, I found a job that paid well, and we decided to move out of that shophouse. It was then that we discovered something else about that room, something that would send a very cold chill down our spines. Something that finally explained all the hardship, sickness and unhappiness my family went through living in that house.  (to be cont'd)

      Yes, for God's sake, please watch out for anything moving in the shadows. Even I get nervous at times, especially when the TV seems to want to come alive in the long, dark midnight. You never know, Sadako may decide to visit.  What is this blog about? I seriously don't know, but hopefully it will never be fully fleshed out. Ideal conditions, uninfluenced by forces beyond control, would dictate that this blog remain an ambiguous, multi-purpose, multi-pronged blog. To remain as a single, defined entity would be to limit and deny oneself of the many possibilities that exist out there.  Let this creature grow as it pleases, I say. Spare the rod and see it absorb both the good and evil, the light and the shadows, the positive and the negative, all the delectable/despicable dualities of life. Let it become many things, let it die and be reborn always. Let it burn, let it cry, let it reincarnate, let it elate.  Part of this will also be a journal about my journey into the filmmaking world, which has just begun, but feels like a thousand years old already. And the name I so chose as a representation of my self here in The Clouded Moon is actually the title of my very first feature script, The Visitor.  Just who is The Visitor? He is an enigma, a puzzle, a horror, a saviour, a devourer, a creator. He comes in the quiet, moonless night, leans close to your face, bathes you in his dry, pestilence-infested breath, and spirits you away to a place where you become a symbol, a metaphor, a signpost to a larger scheme.  So, come in, have a seat, but do not - I stress, DO NOT - look into the shadows too long. For, as someone once said, if the abyss looks back at you, your soul will forever be caught.  And there are many, many shadows, here at The Clouded Moon.

      Lifts are scary things, even long before the Pang Brothers scared the shit out of us with that heart-stopping moment in the film  The Eye . In a small, enclosed&nbsp;space, with no one around, your mind will tend to expect someone or something to appear next to you within those confines. &nbsp; And what more if the lift happens to stop midway ... and the lights go out. &nbsp; It's happened to me before. Apart from the fear of running out of air and dying like a fish out of water, you also begin to feel the silence and the empty space around take on a very palpable form. &nbsp; But what happened to me recently did not happen inside a lift. Rather, it happened as I was heading towards the lift lobby. This was a place I frequented, an apartment block, the lift lobby of which I'd always felt was very creepy and unsettling. &nbsp; One night, as I was heading towards the two lifts, when I was about 20m away, I distinctly remember seeing the lift on the right closing, and a hand stretched out towards the button panel, obviously pressing on the close button. &nbsp; I thought "Oh well, I'll catch the other one." &nbsp; When I got there, I pressed the "up" button and waited. Immediately, THE LIFT ON THE RIGHT OPENED! &nbsp; I jumped. Then I looked up at the indicator above and saw that the other lift was up on the 6th floor. &nbsp; Where was the person in the lift whose hand I saw outstretched? How did the lift get down within seconds? Even if it had gone up only one floor, it would still have taken longer to get back to the ground floor, more so when the "up" button hadn't been pressed yet. &nbsp; I felt a chill. But me being me, I went in anyway. I'm glad to report that nothing happened in the lift. I didn't feel any presence, nor did I smell anything strange. It was an ordinary ride up to the 6th floor. &nbsp; For weeks after that, I was baffled. I kept thinking about it, but couldn't figure it out. I told all my friends about it, and they all went "Oh, my goodness. You are so brave to still get into that lift. I would have bolted!" &nbsp; Now, for me to have still gone into the lift, I figured my sub-conscious mind must have detected some logical explanation to the whole thing. &nbsp; Then, one day, while on the bus to work, I finally figured it out. It hit me so suddenly that its simplicity made me feel absolutely stupid. &nbsp; What happened was this: &nbsp; I had simply mistaken the left lift for the right! Duh-uh! &nbsp; That is how some ghost stories are born. From mere confusion. Somehow our minds love to opt for the stranger, more exciting, supernatural expanation rather than the logical one. We love to be scared. We love that life is not really so dull. We want to believe that things can be extraordinary. &nbsp; The next time something strange happens, stop for a moment to think logically. I'm sure you'll find that there is a sensible answer to whatever it is. &nbsp; Or maybe not. Perhaps you shouldn't get into that lift at all&nbsp;... just to be safe.

      The Visitor has returned from a successful trip to Athens and Crete island. But unsuccessful in finding anything supernatural there, unfortunately!  So, I come home without any tales of ghostly happenings. Even at the island of Spinalonga, the former leper colony also known as the Island of Tears because of the great suffering and hardship that the lepers experienced there, there was no ghost to be found. I asked the tour guide if anyone had reported any strange occurrances, but she said there had been none.  Bummer!  The only time I did feel creeped out was in the cave on Mount Ditka, where, according to mythology, the great god Zeus was born. I was the last person left in the cave after everyone had made their rounds and left. The green lighting in the cave did not help to ease my nerves. I got the hell out of there pretty quick. When I came out of the cave, to my horror, all my companions had left the mountain. I had to climb alone down the steep, rocky mountain, dreading the thought of falling and hurting myself with no one around to rescue me. Alas, I did make it safely down.  The only supernatural thing I found in Greece was a book I bought at the Athens airport, called  Haunted Greece: Nymphs, Vampires and Other Exotica . You got to love that title!  This is what it says on the back cover:  "In  Haunted Greece , John L. Tomkinson takes you on a journey into the dark regions of the Hellenic folk memory. Here you will meet the fearful stringles, who murder infants in their cots; beautiful nymphs who entice young men into insanity; the dead who climb out of their graves to prey upon their friends and relatives; the mischievous demons who emerge from the Underworld during the twelve nights of Christmas; ox-headed serpents which haunt churches and foretell death; the rainbow-plumaged bird whose flight signals imminent catastrophe; and many even more terrible creatures. Some of these may have haunted the imagination of this most inventive people for more than three millennia."  Woo hoo! Just my kind of book!  I'm off to bed now, with all the lights off save the table lamp, snug under the covers, to enjoy this most promising book!

      A former colleague went to Indonesia and found two old keris that she thought her dad would like. She bought them, took them to her hotel room, and placed them one on each side of the bed.  After a good shower, she watched some TV, relaxed, and then reclined on the bed, about to fall asleep. But before that, she inspected the gifts she had bought for her dad. They looked like any old keris, nothing particularly out of the ordinary about them.  She then placed them back one on each side of the bed, before turning out the lights and dozing off.  In the middle of the night, as she recalled later, she either had a very vivid dream, or she really did hear two male voices speaking, one on each side of her.  One of them said: "What are we going to do with her?"  To which the other replied: "I don't know. What do you think we should do?"  After that, there were some other things that were spoken, but she couldn't quite remember what they were exactly.  She woke up the next morning, went to take a shower before packing up to leave. When she was all dried and dressed, she looked for her glasses which she remembered very clearly that she had left on the bedside table.  But they were not there.  She searched high and low for them, but they were nowhere to be found. She had to call front desk to get some help searching the room. They literally turned the room upside down, but the glasses were still nowhere to be found. They had disappeared into thin air!  She had to leave without her glasses in the end. And it was not until much later, when she recalled that dream (or was it a dream?) that she put two and two together and realised what had happened to her glasses.  Coincidence? Or ... ?

      I heard this story many years ago. How true is it? I don't know. I'll leave it up to you to decide.   The Thambi Longkang Hantu Story   There once was a pair of newly -weds who moved into this housing area somewhere in an older part of Kuala Lumpur, after their honeymoon. Their house was situated in a corner lot, and across the road at the side of the house was a big drain, beyond which was forest.  After they moved in, the couple decided to mingle with the neighbours and break the ice by bringing gifts of food for the families in the other houses. They chatted with everyone for a while, trying to learn more about the neighbourhood and its inhabitants. What they didn't count on was getting a very strange warning from one of the neighbours, an elderly woman.  The woman told them: "If ever you should be walking along that road at the side of your house, next to the big drain, and you see a man sitting at the drain, please don't pay him any attention, if you know what's good for you! Just walk away and, for God's sake, don't look back!"  Of course, they thought the warning was a bit hilarious. After all, what is there to fear from a man who sits by the drain?  Then, one night, the couple were coming home from a party at one of the neighbouring houses, and sure enough, they were walking along that road that runs along the side of their house. When they were close to their house, they noticed a man sitting by the drain. Remembering the old lady's warning, the husband reminded the wife not to pay the man any attention.  As they walked nervously past the man, he said to them in a low drawl: "Eh, thambi, lu takut kah?"  The couple were really nervous now, but once they were past the man, the wife made the mistake of turning around to look.  The man wasn't there anymore.  The wife got so frightened, she grabbed her husband's hand and ran into their house.  For the next few days, the wife became seriously ill. The doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong with her. Finally they had to call in a bomoh, who found that the wife had been "disturbed" by some "unclean things." He carried out a ritual and supposedly cleansed the wife.  Then for the next few days, the wife's health improved and she was well on the way to a full recovery.  But one night, the husband awoke and found that his wife was not next to him in the bed. He went searching around the house for her, but to no avail. Finally he went back upstairs and found her sitting at the balcony alone, staring out into the horizon.  He walked up to her and asked her: "Darling, what are you doing out here? Are you alright?"  The wife slowly turned towards him, and said, in a low drawl: "Eh, thambi, lu takut kah?"  The end

      The Visitor is back! For those of you who thought I had been abducted by aliens, swallowed by Hungry Ghosts, kidnapped by  urlLink hanturaya  or ravaged by  urlLink Maya Karin  (I wish!), worry not. None of the above happened.  Rather, I have been having some serious personal problems of late. Hence, time has been of the essence and a little difficult to spare for even  The Clouded Moon . Thanks to the readers who asked about me and took the time to visit this Land of Moving Shadows. You will soon be rewarded! (with a visitation or two, so watch out!)  The Month of the Hungry Ghosts has just begun (Aug 6 to Sept 6), and I'm sure many strange and frightening things abound. I hope to post some delicious tales here soon, so watch this space!  Death, mayhem and horror will rule once again!  (In the meantime, I have to go to Thailand for four days. I shall try to collect some ghostly Thai tales there!)
