      I am feeling ambitious today and decided to post again.  I am starting to frighten myself, as I actually thought about blogging all day.  It is a great diversion from the mental torture that laments me.  "Blogging boom gives Iranian women a voice."  I saw it on the way in here.  Interesting.  Could we now see blogs such as "Today I didn't cover my arms and some jackass threw a rock at me.  I picked it up and threw it back."  The world of blogging will never be the same.  Maybe we will have terrorist bloggers next.  We could see posts such as "I want to blow myself up in a public place and go to heaven where I will have many virgins.  I only have one chance to do it right.  Must be well though out."  Now what I am thinking right now is, are virgins that hard to come by?  Well, I suppose in this country they are.  But from where they come from, I am sure there are many because they aren't allowed outside their homes.  Besides, virgins are over rated.  You really want someone with experience.  Do you want a person who has never built a house before building yours?    Today I learned about the patron saint of marriage (unhappy) Gengulf.  St. Gengulf was a Burgundian knight whose wife cheated on him.  Instead of killing her, which was his right in those days, he just moved to another part of the castle.  Then the crazy bitch sent her lover to hack him to death while he slept.  It's a good thing that nowdays, the unfaithful wife just sends her lawyer to take all your shit instead of killing you.  I think you can learn a lot about marriage when you aren't married.  I have been separated for a little over 2 weeks and am learning that to be married you have to be able to communicate (duh!)  I know I am not the best at vocalizing things.  I do try though.  Since I am a writer, it would suit me better to carry around queue cards to hold up when I need to express myself.  When I got upset, I could hold up the one that said "Can you shut your pie hole for a minute so that we may have a two-way conversation instead of you telling me what an ass hole I am?"  I guess if I did that, I wouldn't be very environmentally friendly though.  I would kill too many trees to fund my expressiveness.  It would be best if I just learned to effectively communicate without using four letter words like stop, help and DAMN!  It's amazing what things you miss when you are no longer with the person you love.  In all seriousness, I have missed a lot of those things even while married.  It's all a giant memory now.  I don't see things as snapshots or images like they show in the movies.  Everything is just blended together, like a montage of film displayed on the same blank white wall.  She told me last night that she will never be the wife I want, a wife that is there all the time.  I always thought a wife was there to support you and be by your side when things were tough.  Someone who would be there during bad times as well as good.  Maybe I read the manual wrong.  I missed the chapter where it explained that marriage is only available when convenient.  I also missed the "disclaimer chapter" where it outlines when it is appropriate to be with your spouse.  I must revisit that sometime.  Evidently, there is a lot of fine print that can save one a lot of anguish.  Maybe she got the revised edition.  The one where it is acceptable to go out drinking and not tell your husband where you went with provisions to allow one to stay out until almost 3 in the morning under these circumstances.  In this scenario, I am also to blame for this "mis-communication" as I am then lacking of trust and "confining" her.  Now let's see, if I saw someone coming at me with a gun pointed at my head, shall I trust that he is probably not going to try to kill me?  In addition, this provision also allows for multiple incidences to not be questioned.

        DAY 1  This is my first entry in my "Blog".  I should have started on a Monday on the first day of the month.  But then I would be tempted to take it one step further and start on the first month of the year as well.  I can't wait that long to start a fuckin' blog.  Plus, who wants to be that "anal."    Today I feel melancholy.  I am in the middle of a divorce.  How good can one possibly feel about that?  It's not something very eventful like a fuckin' birthday or Christmas.  Some will argue that this is a GOOD thing.  My marriage has been in a shithole for some time and this will somehow release me from the shackles of torture.  It's hard loving someone and knowing that letting them go is the best thing for you.  Isn't that irony at its fuckin' best?  Why am I "blogging?"  I read about some slutty government chick who put all her exploits on the web and got fired from her job.  Not that anyone will ever get to read about my "exploits."  Yeah, like I fuckin' have any.  If I couldn't even keep a sexual relationship going in a marriage, how the hell could I do it outside of it?  Although some will contest that marriage kills the sex life, at least there are 2 participants.  It's a lot harder flying solo.  At least in marriage there will always be 1 pilot.  Our plane crashed and burned.  She fell asleep at the wheel.  Am I that fuckin' boring?  I hope not.  Let's just say she was "frigid" and leave it at that.  End of discussion.  Why is my blog entitled "I know what's good for you?"  Simply because I have made more mistakes than I can count on my feet and hands and because you "Learn from your mistakes" that makes me more knowledgable than most.  Learn from my life so you don't end up fucked up like I am.  In addition, I have a slightly higher IQ than the average person in this country.  This makes me slightly more intelligent than a chimpanzee and extrememly more intelligent than the President.  Listen my friend and listen well, the whispers of wisdom will fill you with knowledge.  Knowledge is power...

      It's been over a week since my last post.  Time sure flies.  Even though I feel like I am standing still, my life appears to be accelerating ahead of me.  It's early Friday morning and the thick warm air is filling my small bedroom on the second floor of my parents split level house.  Outside it's much cooler, but I like the confines of my room.  That is how I have been feeling lately.  I retreat into my room where it is warm and safe.    I feel as though someone has kidnapped my heart and didn't bother to leave a ransom note.  I neither have the location nor the possesor.  I know I shouldn't feel this way.  However, my mind does not allow me to escape its torture.  I am not afforded the opportunity to repress my feelings and I am forced to face them.  It seems like most of my heartache and heartbreak has happened to me during the summer months.  Maybe it's the scorching heat.  It could be that summer living is supposed to be easy and I am more susceptible to these things.  That's probably why I hate the summer.  Bad memories.  Bad lies...  These days I reminisce of days past.  I find myself doing that often now as I grow older and as I struggle through tough times.  We tend to do that when we are most vulnerable.  I think about my early days of marriage.  Although it was difficult under circumstance, I felt close to my wife.  She was my best friend.  We would talk for hours about our plans for the future and share pieces of our past.  It was like discovering a whole new world that you had only heard about.  She would always like to surprise me by planning a special getaway or my favorite meal.  Those are the things I miss...  My thoughts drift to the future.  I see a blank canvas for me to paint my masterpiece, but I have no paint for which to create it.  The brushes appear frayed and dried out.  Then I realize, you never really start over or start with a clean slate.  There are always those haunting memories which stain your canvas.  The only thing you can really do is paint over them with new images and new colors.    My Dad has cancer.  Once you verbalize those words, they become real.  The reality of it all becomes clear and all your fears consume you.  I haven't been afraid in many years.  I made a conscious effort to not let anything scare me years ago.  Even if I was, I never let anyone know it.  I don't let many people see my emotions.  That makes me too vulnerable.  Even now, I can't show my parents I am scared.  It is my time to be strong and to support them as they have supported me since my birth.  It's times like these that a man needs a strong woman to stand by him and make him stronger.  It is a burden I must face alone now.  It will only make me stronger, but I know it will also cause me to bury my emotions deeper.  Bitter thoughts of regret.  I have always told myself never to have regrets.  They are a waste of time.  It's all a lie.  We all do whether we tell ourself or others we don't.  But if I really had regrets, it would make me ungrateful.  If I regret certain things in my life, my life wouldn't be quite the same.  One minute detail would severely alter my path and everything I am now might not be.  If I regret meeting the mother of my child, I wouldn't have my child which brings such joy to my life.  If I regret getting married, I wouldn't have the memories I am so fond of and are comforting to me now.  All the people which I have developed relationships with, whose paths I have crossed might not be.  They all serve a purpose, each and every one of them enriching my life in some way.  Awaking in the morning is the best time of day.  For those first five to ten minutes of the day when your mind is clear and the worries of the previous day have evaporated is the most peaceful.  I especially enjoy those moments these days.  The pain of being without my wife is but a fleeting memory.  It's when I realize she is not by my side that the pangs begin and my day starts.  Like most morning pains, you have to slowly arise and they subside.  My creaky heart is heavy and I know that in time it will become lighter and heal.  There is nothing that can describe the feeling of a failed marriage.  There is something heavy on the soul about it.  The pain comes from deep within your bosom and a sickening heat radiates from within you.  It consumes you and weakens you.  The loss is almost mournful as you try to forget, but the echoes haunt you, the sounds pounding deep within.  Some days are better than others.  At times I find myself wandering aimlessly about.  No real direction, just letting my feet lead me as they may.  Some days a ray of hope fills me and I feel I can move my own way.  That is always quickly subdued by reality.
