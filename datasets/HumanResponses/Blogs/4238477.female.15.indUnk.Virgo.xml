        Do you know what it means to be crazy? I'm goin to tell you a story. A powerful wizard, who wanted to destroy an entire kingdom, placed a magic potion in the well from which all inhabitants drank. Whoever drank the water would go mad. The following morning, the whole population drank from the well and they all went mad, apart from the king and his family, who had a well set aside for them alone, which the magician had not managed to poison. The king was worried and tried to control the population by issuing a series of edicts governing security and public health. The policemen and the inspectors, however, had also drunk the poisoned water, and they thought the king's decisions were absurd and resolved to take no notice of them. When the inhabitants of the kingdom heard these decrees, they became convinced that the king had gone mad and was now giving nonsensical orders. They marched on the castle and called for his abdication. In despair the king prepared to step down from the throne, but the queen stopped him, saying: 'Let us go and drink from the communal well. Then we will be the same as them.' And that was what they did: The king ang the queen drank the water of madness and immediately began talking nonsense. Their subjects repented at once; now that the king was displaying such wisdom, why not allow him to continue ruling the country? The country continued to live in peace, although its inhabitants behaved very differently from those of its neighbors. And the king was able to govern until the end of his days.~I want to continue being crazy, living my life the way I dream it, and not the way other people want it to be. Do you know what exists out there? People who have drunk from the same well. They think they're normal, because they all do the same thing. ~Veronika Decides to Die

        Many of us do not remember our dreams. When we wake up in the morning to begin our day, we have no recollection of the images our mind possesses in its sleep. Yet science would tell us we dream every night. Where have our dreams gone? From birth we were raised to hear that our dreams have no importance. Do you remember your mother holding you as a child and saying: "Don't worry, dear, it's ONLY a dream."? In this society that values measurable, scientific data, the importance of dreams has diminished to only random brain activity. We no longer deem our dreams valuable. As modern people, we have explored the vastness of our small planet. We have been to both poles, traveled across unchartered seas in search of exotic lands, and left footprints upon the moon. We have forgotten the worlds that lie under, beyond and within our own. We have forgotten that there are other worlds.

       "Evil is a point of view. We are immortal. And what we have before us are the rich feasts that conscience cannot appreciate and mortal men cannot know without regret. God kills, and so shall we; indiscriminately he takes the richest and the poorest, and so shall we; for no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves, dark angels not confined to the stinking limits of hell but wandering his earth and all its kingdoms." -Lestat
