I haven't seen you in so long!..." etc. See if they play along to avoid embarrassment. -Follow people through the aisles, always staying about five feet away. Continue to do this until they leave the department. -As the cashier runs your purchases over the scanner, look mesmerized and say, "Wow. Magic!" -Put M&M's on layaway. -Move "Caution: Wet Floor" signs to carpeted areas. -Randomly throw things over into neighboring aisles. -Play with the calculators so that they all spell "hello" upside down. -When someone asks if you need help, begin to cry and ask, "Why won't you people just leave me alone?" -When two or three people are walking ahead of you, run between them, yelling, "Red Rover!" -Make up nonsense products and ask newly hired employees if there are any in stock, i.e., "Do you have any Shnerples here?" -Hold indoor shopping cart races. -Dart around suspiciously while humming the theme from "Mission: Impossible." -Attempt to fit into very large gym bags. -Attempt to fit others into very large gym bags. -Two words: "Marco Polo." -Leave Cheerios in Lawn and Garden, pillows in the pet food aisle, etc. -"Re-alphabetize" the CD's in Electronics. -When someone steps away from their cart to look at something, quickly make off with it without saying a word. -Relax in the patio furniture until you get kicked out. -When an announcement comes over the loudspeaker, assume the fetal position and scream, "No, no!

      Ok, you've got to read these!!!! I got them from www.crazythoughts.com if you are bored and want more!  Why is it that when adults have multiple personalities it's schizophrenia, but when a child has imaginary friends it's cute? If you swallow a burp does it turn into a fart? Can you put a gay man in a straight jacket? Do they have burglar alarms at Christian bookstores? Why do bullies always ask "what’s your problem" when they're obviously not going to solve it?  Do stairs go up or down?  When people say, "I’m so tired it's not even funny" or "my head hurts so much it's not even funny", why would it even be funny in the first place?  Why is there a top line on lined paper if we never use it? Do coffins have lifetime guarantees? Why do the numbers on phones go down while the numbers on calculators go up? If Hooters were to become a door-to-door service would they have to change  their name to Knockers? If the sky is the limit, then what is space, over the limit? Are children who act in rated 'R' movies allowed to see them?  Can you make a candle out of your earwax? When French people swear do they say pardon my English? Aren't the 'good things that come to those who wait' just the leftovers from the people that got there first? If the swat team breaks down your door do they have to replace it later? Can a fire truck park in the fire lane? Can it be cloudy and foggy at the same time? "Cute as a button" Is that supposed to be a compliment? Since when are buttons cute? Can you breathe out of your nose and mouth at the same time? Are marbles made of marble?  Why does the last piece of ice always stick to the bottom of the cup? If you pay for a vacation and your plane crashes on the way there, do you get you money back? (Granted you lived) Why did Yankee Doodle name the feather in his hat Macaroni? Who was the first person to look at a cow and say, "I think I'll squeeze these dangly things here and drink what comes out"? Who was the first person to say, "See that chicken over there ... I'm gonna eat the first thing that comes out if its butt"? Isn't Disney World just a people trap operated by a mouse? If electricity comes from electrons, does morality come from morons? Do illiterate people get the full effect of Alphabet soup? Can you get cornered in a round room?  Why do we wash behind our ears? Who really looks there? Why don't the hairs on your arms get split ends? If an atheist has to go to court, do they make him swear on the Bible? Why is it illegal to park in a handicapped parking space but its ok to use a handicapped toilet? In that song, she'll be coming around the mountain, who is she? How come we say 'It's colder than hell outside' when isn't it realistically always colder than hell since hell is supposed to be fire and brimstone? Why is it that if something says, "do not eat" on the packaging it becomes extra tempting to eat? Why are people so scared of mice, yet we all love Mickey Mouse?  Wouldn't it be smart to make the sticky stuff on envelopes taste like chocolate? Why are the commercials for cable companies on cable but not on regular television? Don't they want the people without cable to buy the cable?  "Have you ever noticed that if you rearranged the letters in mother in law, they come out to Woman Hitler?" Isn't it funny how the word 'politics' is made up of the words 'poli' meaning 'many' in Latin, and 'tics' as in 'bloodsucking creatures’? Why is it that when things get wet they get darker, even though water is clear?? Why is it that when you get out of a swimming pool, your urine is hotter when you use the restroom? Can mute people burp? What happens if you put this side up face down while popping microwave popcorn? Why is chopsticks one of the easiest songs to play on the piano, but the hardest thing to eat with? How come you play at a recital, but recite at a play? If a fork were made of gold would it still be considered silverware? If heat rises, then shouldn't hell be cold? Why is there that little space inside strawberries, as if it was meant for a pit, and then the seeds are on the outside? Why isn't chocolate considered a vegetable, if chocolate comes from cocoa beans, and all beans are a vegetable? Do they have girl’s bathrooms in gay bars? Why is toilet bowl cleaning liquid only blue? Why is it when we talk to God we are praying, but when God talks to us we are put into the loony bin? Why do you go “back and forth” to town if you really must go forth before you go back? Why doos shaped macaroni taste better than the normal kind? Why is vanilla ice cream white when vanilla extract is brown? Why can't you get a tan on your palms? If your sick for one week and on one of those days they had to cancel school because of snow, do you have to make up that day in June?

OK, that's just the first page...there's thousands upon millions more at www.crazythoughts.com, I'll post them later...maybe!

      Hi Everyone! This is going to be my diary-online. I have never been much one to keep diaries so we'll see how this goes. I honestly don't care who reads this as long as it's not actually people who I know and/or talk about in here. I don't know why you would want to read this but some people get a weird thrill digging into other people's personal thoughts. I certainly wouldn't want to deprive you of that! WARNING: Ok, here's my disclaimer: My life may not be the most interesting thing you've ever read about but hopefully it won't get too confusing. I'll try to explain everything very thouroly, if I can. Oh, and by the way, I'm also not the best speller. Now if you still want to read all my personal thoughts, I'll keep talking.  Ok, most people want to know about me before they actually see what happens to me everyday. So for starters, I'm 5' 7", Brunette, Brown eyes, not fat and not extremely skinny. I usually wear jeans and a short-sleaved shirt. See, I mis-spelled ...AGAIN! Anyways, where was I, Oh, I live in Kansas, the FLAT state! Yeah, my parents haven't exactly evolved into the computer age yet. I'm down here for an hour to do all my homework. So, I gotta go at 4:30 and I want to do other things, so I'll talk to everyone later! My suggestion of the day: when you go to the bathroom in a public place, stick your hand under the stall door of your neighbor and ask them for a highlighter! K, BYE!

If you try to suppress a sneeze, you can rupture a blood vessel in your head or neck and die.  Rats multiply so quickly that in 18 months, two rats could have over a million descendants.  Wearing headphones for just an hour will increase the bacteria in your ear by 700 times  The cigarette lighter was invented before the match.  Thirty-five percent of the people who use personal ads for dating are already married.  A duck's quack doesn't echo anywhere, and no one knows why.  23% of all photocopier faults worldwide are caused by people sitting on them and photocopying their buttocks.  In the course of an average lifetime you will, while sleeping, eat 70 assorted insects and 10 spiders.  Most lipstick contains fish scales.  Like fingerprints, everyone's tongue print is different.  If you keep your eyes open by force, they will pop out. ----odd, don't ya think?-----
