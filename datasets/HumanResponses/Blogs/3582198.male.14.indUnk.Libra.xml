      Movie review for Harry Potter and the prisoner of askaban  And so we're back to harry's 3rd year at hogwarts, school of witchcraft and wizardry. This is only the beginning of harry's enemy, voldemort, who is starting to come back to power. Now, this is the first harry potter film with a different director, alfonso cuaron or however you spell his name. To tell you the truth, he did a pretty good job, because i've heard from other articles that he likes to make the movies he directs more dramatic and more scary. Chris columbus, former director and producer of the first to films, still changed things up a bit different than the book, but this new spanish derector, did almost everything wrong. i can't tell you anything about it, though, or else it will spoil the suprise. It is also the most scariest of the three created so far, mostly because of professor Lupin transforming to a werewolf, that pretty freaky. And then there's the prediction of professor trelawney, but mostly, once you get past that, it's a pretty good film. --Nateeboy

      For all Halo lovers, read this-- I have some helpful information about Halo 2-- first of all, i heard the halo 2 demo comes out this month! and second of all, i have some helpful hints about halo 2--  First of all, All the vehicles are completley destructible-- if you shoot a tire on the warthog, it will pop off! if the worthog is destroyed and blows up-- be careful-- there's a secondary explosion that can wipe you out. So be careful out there(this is going to make the splitscreen multiplayer so much more fun!). You can't throw grenades when you have double- weapons-- and of course, most of you already know, you can hijack ghosts--oh, one more thing-- there are 4 new worthogs. That's all! --Nateeboy

      Hey Nate this is your sis Ana. I am writing the first entry to say hi and introduce you to your blog. I know the name is a little odd, but it was all I could think of. I won't give you your password here, because that would be stupid, but I will tell you later. This is cool because you can link it to your friends and grandma and grandpa and they can see how your life is. Cool huh? I hope you like it. And about the braces and stuff, don't sweat it- it's only at night, and nobody is going to think and less of you about it k? Have fun with Jojo when he comes over, and remember to write in here every once in a while. I have your password and everything so I might write you a note every once in a while-- look for it! Keepin the peace, and rock on... Your sis, Banana Ana
