       Just one look into your eyes &nbsp;One look and i'm crying 'cause you're so beautiful  Just one kiss and i'm alive One kiss and i'm ready to die 'cause you're so beautiful Just one touch and i'm on fire One touch and i'm crying' cause you're so beautiful Just one smile and i'm wild. One smile and i'm ready to die 'cause you're so beautiful Oh and you're so beautiful My darling Oh you're so beautiful You're so beautiful Oh my baby You're so beautiful And you're so beautiful Oh my darling Oh my baby And you're so beautiful Beautiful by H.I.M  I love this song. Just because I cut to it and it make me feel..justified. In an odd way.&nbsp; It's ironic for sure and it is great to sing along and watch the knife bite into my wrist. It really is. Great release. But I lost my knife. I haven't any clue about how long I have gone without cutting or even my knife but it is driving &nbsp;me near hysterical. I feel like something is missing...like I am lost. My knife is like my security blanket. I don't feel right without it. I have been keeping myself busy though, my annoying company finally left. FINALLY. He tried to make me hug him. HA! Wasn't gonna happen. I only hug people who I think deserve it or people whom I don't know.  "It's like its hands are behinds it back holding a sharp butcher knife and is about to pounce and tear you to shreds any moment :)" I siad that to a freind a moment ago. What a&nbsp; twisted mind I have. I mean I said that when she pointed out that the :D face on MSN is scary. Whenever I blog on this paticular blog I always become me. Not Her but me. I am rarely me. I can't be me. Maybe thats why I like to act and dance. I dont have to be me and feel guilty about not being me. I have reason not to be me. No one would like me. I hate people who think I am less of an equal then them. I hate it, there isn't any reason for thoughts like that.  Currently I have a mosquito sucking blood from my arm. Maybe I'll get West Nile Virus, and die. With my luck I probably won't. Oh well. The mosquito has been here for a while, maybe I shall name her Drucilla. Yes. she'll be like my other friends, come to suck my blood and then fly away, leaving me with a sore spot. ..That's not really fair. I do have some good friends. Especially Alesha. She is my bestest truest friend. I've&nbsp; known her since kindergarden and I am extremely glad I met her.&nbsp;So thank you Alesha for being my true friend, and for letting me be me. I know you will never read this but maybe If I do end up dying by my own hand you'll find this because I told you about it. I know thats morbid or something but i feel blank again, and when I get blank I get semi-morbid.  I had a nice long bath and now I am so clean that I rival Mr. Clean, or I could at least become his mistress. I have my Drama/Dance preformance tomorrow. Alesha and Carrie say that they are going to come watch. I don't want them to, yet I do. I have to stand still for a very long time, I can't fidget, talk or look around. I have to Focus. Ms. Lihou says that that is her 'F' word. I agree. I have good focus. At least I think I do. Not much distracts me. Although once I start smiling sometimes I take a while to stop....thats is of course assuming I DO smile...I guess I smile alot though, but it is never a 'happy' smile. Just one of those fixed ones. Unless it is something that strikes me paticularly funny about the situation, and that happens fairly often...at all the wrong times. My smiles around lots of people who expect me to smile fade within seconds. You know the saying or old wives tale or whatever it is that is something like 'If you are grumpy then smile and you'll feel better' &nbsp;That doesn't work for me, in fact, and I quote "You do grumpy like no one else."&nbsp;But it is true, if I smile while I am upset it just makes it worse. I feel fake. I hate feeling fake. Feeling fake makes me feel...gross. Slimy and artificial, plastic and silicon or however you spell it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I wish I was ice, numb from the inside. I think that would be the perfect way to live. Not worrying about anything...not caring. Not thinkging about the millions of children dieing every minute or the thousands of animals slaughtered uselessly for the million of people who are already to fat and shouldn't be eating anymore or else their greedy little hearts would explode. I wish they would. I shouldn't start myself on the unfairness and stupidity of the world and its many economies and governments. I will babble on forever and bore myself to the tears that won't come under any other circumstance. I am a self pitying fool, and I am quite aware of it. Quite aware. How couldn't I be, with friends that are constantly telling me that I am giving off the grumpy vibe and that I am never happy. You know sometimes I wonder if they even realize that they aren't helping in the slightest. Alesha doesn't do that. Sure she is human and it bothers her if I do it too much but I just don't close up as much around her, probably because she always makes me laugh. I hope everyone has a friend like Alesha.&nbsp; Someone who you don't really talk about things like your personal life and everything wrong with it, but the things that are fun, and amusing. Things that make you laugh no matter what is going on. Bah, well here I go again, babbling and being all sentimental. I should probably sleep because I have the thing tomorrow. I haven't been sleeping a whole lot lately and I know if I start thinking about the preformance&nbsp;I will just get all nervous and jittery. I always do, it's inetivitable. Even if I am on a school soccer team and we are&nbsp; going to a game, I ALWAYS get nervous. So the butterflies in my stomach have plenty of excercise. People never really notice though. I never tell them anymore either, they always tell me that I shouldn't be or they shurg and look away, all the while shooting little glances at me that practically shout 'Weirdo' and "Freak" and not in the good definition. 'But enough is enough'  As the good man on t.v. said I should probably stop my needless babbling now and say goodnight, not that there is anyone to read this anyways, I babble far to much for any ones interest. But maybe someone or some people do read this? In that case I ask you all or just you to comment, nothing long, just maybe 'Hey I read&nbsp; this, keep up the useless babble' or 'What the hell is your fucking problem?! No one cares how you feel.'&nbsp; You know, just something to let me know if other people read this. Oh. Well I really have to go now. Night everyone, sleep tight and have pleasant dreams or none at all.

It's upsetting.&nbsp;I basically have started sleeping the morning [6am till10am] away and staying up the rest of the time,&nbsp; it makes for a very tired me.&nbsp; My music isnt downloading and it is pissing me off, but really in real life I am a nice person. This is just my mean blog. My ear is so fucking pusy.&nbsp; Gar. I dont know how to make the fucking pictures work. :X bah maybe I'll just go.....do something.

       'What is it?' Tawny's sleepy voice carried across the room to where she was standing, staring blankly down at the rugged old carpet.  'N-nothing. Everything is alright, just go back to sleep.' The lie left a bitter taste in her mouth but she knew she couldn't let Tawny find out. Everything would be come so...wrong. She heard Tawny sigh and mumble something, then listens as  the sheets rustles as Tawny settles herself back into bed. Looking up hesitantly she gazes over at Tawny and bites down a whimper.  Gods..she looks so peaceful, an angel in this world of pain.  She shook her head to clear her mind of those thoughts and concentrated on something other then Tawny and the way a strand of her black hair fell across her mouth and how she longed to brush it away for her... No dammit! Think about something else!  Backing up against the door she closed her eyes and rests her head against it.  Where had all these thoughts come from? I've never felt like this before...but ever since....well it's no use thinking about that now. What happened happened.  Re-opening her eyes she jumps a little when she sees Tawny looking at her, a odd look in her eyes. 'T-tawny? W-w-what did I do?' There is a long silence and she shifts self-conciously under Tawny's stare.   'Oh nothing, you haven't done anything.' She relaxes and smiles hesitantly at Tawny.   'Oh..alright. Uhm...do you need something?'  Gods know I do...  Straightening suddenly she mentally slaps herself.  Where the hell did that come from?! I do  not  need anything, especially from Tawny!.  Looking at Tawny again she watches the last of the weird look in Tawny's eyes dissapear and lets out a breath she wasn't aware she was holding.  'No that's aright, I'm fine.'  'Oh ok. Well go back to bed Tawny, we have exams in the morning.' She takes off her jacket slowly and hangs it up, then walks over to her closet to get her p.j.'s. Grabbing them she turns and yelps in suprise when she sees Tawny standing there, blocking her way to the little bathroom they share. 'Tawny?! What are you do-' She is cut off as Tawny leans against her and wraps her arms around her.  'Shush..just be quiet.'  Stunned she stands there awkwardly as Tawny holds her, not daring herself to talk or even breathe. She looks down as Tawny pulls away and looks up at her, her eyes searching hers. Then leaning up slowly she gasps in shock as Tawny gently puts her lips against hers. She shivers and stiffens, her eyes closed now. They open as Tawny pulls away like she had been burned.  'Oh god, I'm sorry. I thought...I mean I didn't know..I just'  Tawny's stuttering was cut short as she dropped her pajamas and stepped forward, taking Tawny in her arms and kissing her gently. 'It's ok. Really.' Her heart grows warm as Tawny smiles, a heart-stopping smile full of joy and..relief? She feels herself being pulled forward as Tawny backs up towards the bed. Her heart flutters and she wonder frantically if this is such a good idea.  What if she doesn't want me in the morning? What if this is just her way to forget about everything that has happened?   She falls forward onto Tawny, twisting away so she doesn't land fully on her. Sitting there she looks at Tawny, her heart torn. Speaking quietly her voice breaks as she voices her concern. 'Tawny are you sure I mean...this isn't something out of-' Once again she is cut of as Tawny kisses her, and not so innocently this time. Any other worries she has are lost as Tawny shows her what it feels like to be loved.  Heh, horrible I know. I was just playing around with ideas. And I left the other girls name out of it on purpose, sorry if it doesn't make any sense. I will probably be doing alot of things like this, not necessarily about sex and  Shay'a'chern  but about little stories, little things like the one with the girl on the balcony. I do accept comments and feed back, and it doesn't even have to be nice, just know that I haven't ever done something like this before. Oh well..I won't be here for the next couple of days because I am going camping with my cousin...Peace to every one, wind to thy wings.

      Thats what my life is. MY pain and hurt and suffering is nothing compared to the others in this world. I have no right to call myself suicidal. so I cut myself. so I watch myself bleed and I cry. it isnt anything to what some people do. my life is heaven compared to some. I'm going now. Bye.

      I finished The Last Herald-Mage series and let me tell you...I am stunned. Still. I havent been so moved by a book series since I read the Queens Own series. Mercedes Lackey is amazing, i am in total awe of her. I couldnt ever do what she does, how she makes the characters so real, how she makes me care for them and makes me feel how they do. Vanyel, Yfandes, Stefen, Tylendel, Savil..they all die. I know I ruined it but gods...it's the  way  they die. I have yet to have my emotional break down from finishing the books but I can feel it rising, s'only a matter of time. Gods how I yearn for that time to be  real . Magic, Heralds, Lifebonds...It's full of trouble and I know it wouldnt be the most peaceful thing but it would be amazing. Just amazing. I hate this world and I hate the people in it. My step-grama is dying and when I come back from camping with my cousin and family in five days everyone expects her to be dead. People give up so easily. I dont know what she is like, but I know she says she is dying, so she prolly is. I feel...empty to this fact, kind of detatched, emotionless. i like it. I dont like the feelings I do have. Especially the ones like yesterday. True if I am feeling it means I havent given up yet. Even though I dont think of it as giving up. More of a weariness. I am just so tired of this world. I really am. I try and force myself to enjoy it but I just cant. A world of magic...thats more than I can ever even hope for. It's a constant ache. If only it could be real. I'm 14 and yet I still wish for a fairy tale land to save me from myself. it isnt going to happen and I know it. But I still wish...I wish for it more then I wish to have anything thing else.   Anything  .

       *she blinked as the rain flowed steadily down her face, masking the fact that it wasnt just the rain flowing from her eyes, and took a desperate breath. biting down hard on her already bloody and swollen lip, she struggled to keep the last of her broken sobs inside. curling tighter into the ball that she has made herself into, she rests her sopping wet head on her just-as-wet knees and  willed herself to stop thinking.*    Oh god..just please let it stop. I dont want to go through this again..    *slowly her shoulders stop shaking but as she lifts her head off of her knees, you can tell she is still crying. her slightly puffy, red eyes and the look of complete hopelessness are enough to make even the hardest man break down in tears. gazing from her spot in the corner of her balcony she looked over and down to the faraway land below and wished she had the courage to do what she had so often dreamt of.*   Just to make it all end...never feel anything again...   *a hand lifted from around her knees and reached to the bar that supports the railing. holding onto it like a prisoner confined to their jail, her eyes go even more hopeless and lost and her shoulders begun shaking with the effort of keeping back the sobs that she had shut down inside of her, destermind to not let anyone hear her. her eyes closed again she turned her face up into the pouring rain, savouring the feeling of her harshly warm tears mix with the soothing coolness of the rain drops.*    The pain..    *a sob full of such lost hope and despair escaped from her mouth and she lost all of her determination to keep it all back, gods know she did it for long enough. her body shook violently as she just let herself go, losing herself in her yearning for an end and her guilt for feeling such a way when she has such great friends.*    But they dont know....they cant know...Torn..I'm so uncertain of what to do. I cant leep living this way. I have to do something!    *the feeling of the need to take action grew in her until it was an all consuming fire, feeding at her mercilessly. yet she didnt move once. she didnt stand to throw herself from the balcony but nor did she cry out for help. She remained motionless. Stunned and weakend from the fire that was still burning inside of her. only now it had changed, instead of the need to do something there was the numbness, a feeling of...nothing.*

      I've been crying on and off all day. Reading constantly and almost never stopping. I'm exhausted. Phsyically, mentally and emotionly. I cant get over the feeling of complete helplessness and isolation. I want to die. I wouldnt make that much of a difference to the billions of people on the world. The billions of people who have no purpose but can go on with their meaningless lives anywas. If you really think about this world you will ultimitley come to the same conclusion I have. There is no point. There isnt. There never was and never will be. The only purpose's and reasons we have are because we as humans have created them. there isnt any real reason. If everyone on earth dies the universe isnt going to explode. I'm utterly trapped in my longing to live carelessly but my needing to die. Nothing is worth anything. We are all alone. We are born alone and we die alone. Simple as that. I yearn for the stories of Valdemar to be real, and myself a herald with a Companion who loves me. I dont want this pointless droning on of life. I cant stress it enough that there isnt any point. We are born, we live a little, then we die. so what? the only thing we make a good impact on is the humans around us, and it isnt even always good. I   want   to die before I am 18, so I can save myself from the uselessness of this all. I would hurt the people around me and I'd be thought of as selfish but I dont care anymore. I just want the needlessness of my life to end.

      My god...there is no way to describe the brilliance of her books. I read from 11 to 5 o'clock this morning. slept for 4 hours and started reading again. The last herald mage series is....amazing. just bloody amazing. it made me cry and it made me laugh. I still feel like crying every time I think of Vanyel and Tylendel. all the hurt, desolation, despair, suicidal-ness and the complete and total love they had...it...oh my god  I really cant explain it. I am quite literally stunned. and it was only the first book in the series. I have never wanted to live but die so much. It scared me with the depth of the gut wrenching feelings they had..the hopelessness and the feeling of being lost especially, because I have felt those two emotions tear me apart and eat at me from the inside. never certain of what to do, not certain if I could evern DO something...just...wow..

      Well..this is my second go at this. Only I am not going to tell anyone that I know of this blog. When they read my other blog I feel like I cant say how I feel. This is going to be my little...refuge. a place where I can say how I really feel and not sensor it. I guess I should warn you that I have problems. Nothing serious, like no diseases but I feel trapped, suicidal and lost alot. As well as angry. But sometimes I do feel happy and i get really weird and annoying. I basically hate my personality, but more on that later. Anyways hello to all whom are and arent reading this. Enjoy...or rather try. I suspect you wont, but then again I dont either.

        I really have nothing to say as of late. I'm all blah like. Yet again I am realizing my insignifigence or however it is spelt. My life....is so much better then some. Why am I so Unhappy within it? I don't think I will ever know.     I wanted to know   Who you really are   I needed the chance   To stitch up my scars   I'm closer to you   Than I was in the start   So dive right in   And tear me apart   I'm trapped   And we can't get along   I thought that I was strong   We are so unstable   And then   I'm strung out from your touch   But I won't give you up   We are so unstable   I wanted to learn   About the dark side of you   You bring me down   Like a bottle of pills   I hate the way   That you make me feel   I keep coming back   I never get you   I'm trapped   And we can't get alongI thought that I was strong   We are so unstable  And thenI'm strung out from your touch   But I won't give you up   We are so unstable   You're so unstable (x2)   We're so unstable (x2)   I'm trappedAnd we can't get along   I thought that I was strong   We are so unstable   And then   I'm strung out from your touch   But I won't give you up   We are so unstable   I'm trapped   And we can't get along   I thought that I was strong   We are so unstable   And thenI'm strung out from your touch   But I won't give you up   We are so unstable   You're so unstable   I'm so unstable   We're so unstable    I'm so unstable     Cut my life into pieces   I've reached my last resort, suffocation, no breathing   Don't give a fu** if I cut my arm bleeding   Would it be wrong, would it be rightI   f I took my life tonight, chances are that I might   Mutilation out of sight and I'm contemplating suicide   Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind   Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine   Nothing's alright, nothing's fine   I'm running and I'm crying   I never realized I was spread too thin   'Til it was too late and I was empty within   Hungry, feeding on chaos and living in sin   Downward spiral, where do I begin?   It all started when I lost my mother   No love for myself no love for another   Searching to find a love on a higher level   Finding nothing but questions and devils   Cause I'm losing my sight losing my mind   Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine   Nothing's alright, nothing's fine   I'm running and I'm crying   I can't go on living this way     Gone with the sin.

        I wrote this last night while I was really upset..again. I cut before I wrote this and the page is all splattered with blood. But it doesn't matter. anyways here it is:     She falls to the floor with a heartrending sob and slowly crawls her way into her dark corner. With her back against the wall and her knees pulled up to her face, her shoulders begin to shake violently as the first of her hopeless tears fall from her lost brown eyes. The emotions coursing through her are anything but welcome and she tries desperately to shove them back into the dark part of her battered soul. Succeeding in only intensifying the overwhelming sense of being lost, alone and forever helpless, she reaches for her razor and pulls the many bracelets and things away from the battlefield of scars already on her wrist. Tears obscuring her vision she tries and fails to slit her wrist. Cursing she wipes away the hot tears with her now bloody palm and stares at her wrist, hesitation and the unbridled suicidal urges pulsing through her. Finally she bites down hard on her lip in determination and brings the razor down to her wrist. Slowly and in excruciating pain she slices through the skin and the veins, causing the haunting red of her blood to come gushing out, staining the blades and her carpet. Her arm, slit from the middle of her forearm to the begginning of her palm, flops lifelessly beside her still tucked up legs and she stares at it in a blood loss induced haze. Still wondering what she just did she doesn't hear her mother walk in and cry out in horror. Not quite relieved yet not feeling any regret, she lets go of her thin thread of conciousness and slips into the blackness, the sirens calling out their warning call in the back of her mind.

         My head hurts and it is spinning around, so that everytime I stand I am dizzy and disoriented. My wrist stings. I cut again. I am a fucking wuss. I barely made it bleed. Just some surface scratches. I'm so out of it. I feel so...floaty. Kinda detached from my body. Ugh. I didn't even have a good reason to cut again. My life has been...okay. It's been the best it has in a while. But it is so addicting. Like a bug bite that you know you shouldn't scratch but do it anyways cause it feels so good.  Ack...

       Stupid non-supportive mother who needs to sleep a lot fucking more. Damn her and her always getting mad at me that she doesn't even realize it anymore, and then acts like she wasn't just yelling at me.     Vindicated  Hope, It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out A shine of it, has caught my eye. It roped me in so...mesmorizing so...hyptnotizing I am, captivated I am, Vindicated I am selfish, I am wrong, I am right, I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along, and I am thawed,but I am cleaning up so well, I am seeing in me now The things you swear you saw yourselves...So clear, like the diamond in your ring. Cut to mirror your intention. Oversized and overwhelmed, The shine of which has caught my eye It rendered me so, isolated so, motivated I am..certain now that I am... Vindicated I am selfish, I am wrong, I am right, I swear I'm rightt I swear I knew it all along, and I am thawed,but I am cleaning up so well,I am seeing in me now The things you swear you saw yourselves...So tired, of the corners of your lips Bite them, and feel my fingertips Trace the moment for forever..Defense is paper thin, just one touch and I'll be into, deep now to ever swim Against the current..so let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip against the current. So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away So let me slip away. Vindicated I am selfish, I am wrong, I am right, I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along, and I am thawed,but I am cleaning up so well,I am seeing in me now The things you swear you saw yourselves...My hope dangles on a string. Like slow spinning redemption.

       I hate this stupid website. I really do. None of those worked!! Hopefully this on will! Gah, I am just gona..delete all the ones that didn't work. Well the last 2 or 3. Hmmph. I feel sick. My fucking eyeliner broke and I am realizing that my spelling sucks and needs definite improvement. Bah.

      I do believe that my last post didnt work. Blooger is being a right ass this week now isn't it? I am...upset. But not. I know I should be angry but I don't feel any different than I did moments ago when I thought the freaking thing worked. I had an interesting conversation with Carrie. She asked me why I cut. I asked her why she cut. Neither of us answered. Isn't that the way it is supposed to be? No one telling anyone anything? So that nothing can happen to hurt you? I think so. I feel bad because I think it has something to do with her dad...and me. She may've started after I did. I think I might've helped her decide that she could. I don't know though. Who am I to judge other peoples thoughts and actions? No one. You know sometimes I wish I had someone to hold me and comfort me about the minor things, like losing something or someone and stubbing your toe. Or someone to hold me and comfort me for no reason. But then I think about how I would probably hurt them. Bu I amleaing now. goodnight.
