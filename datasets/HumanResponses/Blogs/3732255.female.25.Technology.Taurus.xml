      Social Distortion will be releasing their first ever full-length concert release entitled “Live In Orange County” on July 27, 2004, coming out on Time Bomb Recordings. This is only the second time (since Another State of Mind) that the group has been captured on film. This event was filmed on January 19, 2003, at the House of Blues in Anaheim, CA, and will feature back stage footage, interviews, a photo gallery and more.   “ Live In Orange County” spans the guys extensive history, and will take you from “Mommy’s Little Monster” through “White Light, White Heat, White Trash”, and includes two never before released songs, “Footprints On My Ceiling” and “I Wasn’t Born To Follow”. Both songs are to be included on Social Distortion’s forthcoming studio album due out later this year.

      This past weekend the  Bouncing Souls  sailed into Asbury Park to shoot a new video for "Anchors Aweigh". The video was directed by Christian Winters of  Hilo Films . The bulk of the video (shot right down the street from the  Chunksaah Records office) was done on the Asbury Park boardwalk just north of Convention Hall. You can check out some behind the scenes photos at the Chunksaah Archive Gallery.  Also, former Sticks & Stones and Zero Zero guitarist and one time Bouncing Souls collaborator  Mike Cavallaro (a.k.a. Johnny X)  has turned his attention to his other love: comics. Here's an update from Johnny X:  This weekend, June 26th and 27th is New York City's annual MOCCA cartoon art convention, and I'll be there at my table, with both issues of "66 Thousand Miles Per Hour" and some freebies I've made, tucked away in some dark corner of the Puck Building on the corner of Houston and Lafayette streets. There is so much great art and cool things going on every year at this thing, don't miss it if you're in the area. See you there, Johnny X  Via  www.punknews.org

       MxPx  originally signed with A&M records in 1998 in an arrangement with Tooth and Nail allowing the band to have additional opportunities not available to the independent labels. However, in the world of corporate record companies, the small "boutique" A&M records became part of  Interscope Records  who clearly could not embrace  MxPx  even though the band's continued to have a growing fan base and toured to sell out venues. After years of frustration,  MxPx  and  Interscope (A&M) Records  have parted ways...  The band is currently in the studio working on new material and weighing their options for future releases. Mike Herrera commented that "Anything can happen from here. We're really excited about what the future holds. We feel like schoolboys on the first day of summer."

      ...and we mean that in the nicest way! Shai Hulud, who have been breaking up for longer than they've been together (or so it seems these days), posted the following in regards to their supposed "last show" at Hellfest (which wraps up today):Good grief. So much hubbub. Listen, Hulud is only alotted a 25 minute set at Hell Fest. My friends, you may disagree, but we Huluds - even the ones not continuing on with the band - feel Hulud's "last show" is worth more than 25 minutes. What does this mean? Cripes, does it have to be spelled out for you? We ain't quitting just yet. Fact: Yes, Hell Fest will most likely be Geert's last show with the band. Ree-guard-less, the music you'll be hearing and the words we'll be singing aren't getting a burial. Not this Sunday; not even next. Business as usual over here. Onward and upward. Think you got the vocal chops? Send Mad Matt Fletcher an email:  urlLink fletcher@hulud.com .  Via  urlLink punknews.org

      According to a post on the band's official site, Ozma has called it quits after five years. Singer/guitarist Ryen Slegr had this to say on the subject:   "Dear ozma fans,  I regret to inform you the band has called it quits. It's been a pleasure to get to know all of you at the shows and through the forum, you’ve all helped our band be all that it could and for that I am personally thankful. It would be impossible to explain all the reasons for our decision due to their personal nature. These problems have affected the creative and professional facets of the band to the extent that no one feels like continuing any longer. Though I personally wanted to wait to make this decision and give everyone the opportunity to think things over, in hopes that something might be salvaged, certain members felt the need to end things as quickly as possible. Therefore, I see no point in waiting even a few more hours to let all of you know what’s happening. Again, I'm sorry to have to tell you this. I'm telling you this without the consent of the other members of the band, though based on our most recent discussion less than an hour ago I believe the decision to be final and this to be accurate information.  Thanks for the memories and all the kind words over the years that kept us going. Please continue to listen to the music as you always have and remember us as we once were. The forum will remain in operation for the next 2-4 months.  Sincerely,  singer/guitarist  Ryen Slegr"   Drummer Patrick Edwards has recently added to the post on the website, simply affirming Ryen's post and thanking the fans for supporting the band.   Bassist Daniel Brummel is expected to continue playing with the Elected; no word on where the members of Ozma will end up.   Via  urlLink punknews.org

      Nick 13 writes the following: "We are very sorry to announce that our friend & brother Fred Hell will no longer be playing with Tiger Army, due to heath reasons stemming from his shooting in March '03. Fred's courage and hard work has been an inspiration to everyone, but he's just not physically up to the challenge of touring. There are no hard feelings on the part of anyone, we're all just thankful for the last three years of playing together and the fact that Fred's alive. Best of luck to Fred in his continued recovery and pursuit of musical excellence, he will always be part of the Tiger Army family." Mike Fasano, who drummed on the band's latest album III: Ghost Tigers Rise has graciously agreed to step in for the shows on this summer's Warped Tour, which begin this week.

      Green Day will continue their protest against George Dubya Bush with a blatant statement on the cover of their next album. Not only does the title 'American Idiot' say what they want to say, the artwork on the cover depicts a hand clutching a bleeding heart shaped hand grenade.   Also, in other Green Day new - Madden 2005," due August 12, promises all the bone-crushing hits, jaw-dropping jukes and gridiron grip of its predecessor, all to the tune of another star-packed soundtrack.   Green Day lead the charge of artists unveiling new material in the game. Even before it goes to radio, the title track from the band's forthcoming album, American Idiot, due September 21, will blare from TV speakers as teams vie for the Lombardi Trophy. Similar exclusivity is given to tracks by producer Jazze Pha ("Da Heavy Hittas") and Will.I.Am of the Black Eyed Peas ("Go!").   Transcending the mixtape circuit for the circuit board, rapper Yung Wun donates his street hit "Yung Wun Anthem," expected to also surface on his debut, Dirtiest Thirstiest, due July 13. Mash-up master DJ Z-Trip lends his skills to a couple of tracks: an original called "Listen to the DJ" that features Soup of Jurassic 5, and "The Madden Re-Match," a hybrid comprising rap group the D.O.C. and metal band Earshot, who also contribute a track of their own, called "Wait."   The soundtrack also includes artists such as New Found Glory, Hoobastank, the Hives and Franz Ferdinand contributing cuts from their current albums, and one old-school track: Faith No More's 1989 classic "From Out of Nowhere."   "Madden 2005" track list, according to Electronic Arts:  Wylde Bunch-"Last Day of School"  New Found Glory - "This Disaster"  Earshot - "Wait"  Hoobastank - "Same Direction"  Ozomatli - "Saturday Night"  Jazze Pha - "Da Heavy Hittas"  Strata - "Piece by Piece"  Yung Wun - "Yung Wun Anthem"  The D.O.C. vs. Earshot - "The Madden Re-Match"  Z-Trip f/ Soup of Jurassic 5 - "Listen to the DJ"  Will.I.Am - "Go!"

      Glen Danzig Gets Knocked the F**k OUT!  A video that was shot backstage at the recent Danzig show in Tuba City Arizona is circulating quickly around the net. Reportedly, The band North Side Kings were on the bill and was bumped completely from the show, after they drove 6 hours from thier hometown. This video is a portion of what happened when a NSK member went to find out why they were bumped. Clearly, as you will see, Glenn assaults the guy first, then gets knocked out.

      Hellcat Records will release the Dropkick Murphys' update of the Royal Rooters fight song "Tessie" as a single on August 1st. All proceeds from the single will go to benefit the Red Sox Foundation. Here's a recap of the history behind the song: Dropkick Murphys and the Boston Red Sox have given a modern treatment to “Tessie.”   The song — originally a Broadway hit — became the anthem for a growing band of Boston diehards known as the Royal Rooters and helped spur the Red Sox (then known as the Boston Pilgrims) on to a dramatic come-from-behind victory in the first World Series in 1903.   The cover art can be found on Epitaph's website. You can now view a video for the song that the band recently shot at Fenway Park:   Low- http://www.epitaph.com/_lib/streamvideo.php?id=4835&type=lo    High-  http://www.epitaph.com/_lib/streamvideo.php?id=4835&type=hi     Via  punknews.org

Former Dead Kennedys lead singer Jello Biafra has dropped his remaining lawsuit against members of his band. In May 2000, a jury convicted Biafra and his record label of breach of contract and fraud. In June 2003, a state appeals court upheld that decision and ordered Biafra to pay $220,000 in back royalties and other damages. It also decided the band's creative output, including songs "Holiday in Cambodia" and "Kill the Poor," belongs to a partnership formed among the four band members.   But the panel reversed the lower court's decision to break up the partnership, remanding the case back to the trial court to determine whether a partnership among the band members should be dissolved and its assets sold.   On June 30, Biafra agreed "the partnership's assets would be substantially diminished" by breaking it up.   "Personally and professionally, I just want to put this entire chapter behind us and concentrate on making music again," bassist Klaus Flouride said.   The San Francisco-based punk band performed together from 1978 to 1986. The band re-formed without Biafra and has been playing as the Dead Kennedys, according to its publicist, Josh Mills.

      This was posted on the official Bad Religion Message Board by Mr Brett. Just sharing a bit of my morning reading as usual. I will dedicate this one to any of you on the board who might be naive enough to be considering the U.S. arms services as a career path.   The Daily Misleader shows just how President Bush has gone about strengthening the "hollowed out" Clinton armed forces: "President Bush celebrated the July 4th holiday by praising veterans, saying 'we're proud of your service, we're grateful for the example you have set for America.' But a new report shows that more than half a million veterans are going without health care benefits owed to them -- and the Bush administration has tried to keep those veterans in the dark.   "According to Knight-Ridder newspapers, 572,000 veterans nationwide 'are missing out on disability payments from the Veterans Administration' even though they are owed those payments from their service. A large portion of these veterans are not receiving their payments because they do not know about them -- a situation the White House has tried to perpetuate. In 2002, VA officials were ordered by the Bush administration 'to cease efforts to enroll new patients into its health care system.' The directive said it was 'inappropriate' for local VA workers to attend health fairs, open houses and community meetings to educate veterans about what their eligibility and to enroll them in health care programs.'" That's an odd way of "supporting the troops," Mr. President.  Via  punkbands.com

      Victory Records has announced the signing of Toronto’s The Black Maria. Following the implosion of the genre-defining Grade (the band that many music writers and bands give credit to for the creation in 1995 of the screamo genre), its mastermind and creative leader Kyle Bishop was possessed to create something profoundly new and vibrant. He connected with Chris Gray (Zyon) and wall of sound axe-wielder Alan Nacinovic. The troupe was completed with a groove-laden rhythm section that can shatter the bones of the Gods - Derek Petrella on Drums and multi-instrumentalist Mike De Eyre on bass. They chose the The Black Maria as their band name, which comes from the slang term given to a police patrol wagon- “The Deliverer of Death”  The Black Maria head into the studio this July to record their debut album.

      Okay so July 1st this year was kind of a bomb...ha no pun intended.  So we went to T.O. to see Pennywise and to watch fireworks...well we sort of saw Pennywise and really didn't see any fireworks.  Al, Jamie, Ben, Keith and I spent the day in T.O. and that was awesome but then it came time to watch the fireworks thinking that, as the ticket said, Pennywise started at 10:30pm.  So we are waiting for the 10pm fireworks to start and they didn't so the closer to 10:30 it came the more antsy we all got.  So we left there and walked to the Kool Haus to find out that Pennywise started at 10.  SO after getting a little pissed off we went in and enjoyed the rest of the show.  They totally covered a Nirvana song and dedicated it to Kurt Cobain...that was awesome! So to make the day a little worse Fletcher(one of the guys in the band) couldn't get across the border so he wasn't there...but to make the day a little better, we really didn't miss any of the songs we wanted to see.  So I guess all and all everything was pretty cool!   I still missed my fireworks though and had to settle with July 4th fireworks on TV :(

      Fenix Tx played 2 shows on Saturday at Chain Reaction in Anaheim. Adlephi opened the afternoon show and were awesome; it was a great time for their first west coast show. Make sure to see them next week with Home Grown! Fenix played an hour long set with a mix of songs from both CDs plus a reworked (and awesome) version of O'Bleek from their first EP. They sounded really good, especially since they only practiced twice in 3 years a week before the show. Unfortunately they couldn't do an encore because of time restrictions getting ready for the second show. The second show hellogoodbye opened and the kids were singing along and dancing. A bunch of them had been to the BBQ and Kickball game that Hellogoodbye hosted before the show. The second Fenix show blew away the first show. They played a longer set and the crowd was singing the words to every songs REALLY loudly. The band seemed to have a good time. Thanks to all of the people who flew in from NY, London and Japan for the show! It was awesome to see everyone out there and brought back good memories since Fenix Tx were the first band we ever signed.  By the way, Fenix Tx made a LIMITED EDITION, hand silk-screened poster (on card stock) for the show. They look AWESOME. They sold 100 out of the 150 at the show, and all of the guys in the band signed the other 50 to sell on our store, so check it out. They also made shirts for the show, and we are selling the remaining shirts on the store as well. Both items will be under the autograph and special items section of the store.

      The Epitaph Charities Project is an annual charitable donation that represents the values of both Epitaph and YOU, the ones who support the label. For the last three years we've picked our favorite charitable organizations, and asked you to tell us which ones are the most important to you by taking a few seconds to vote in our instant poll. This year nothing is as important as the upcoming election, so all the charities in our poll are ones involved in voter registration, education and mobilization for the 2004 elections. This year the poll will only be open for four weeks so we can send our donation in time to make a difference in the upcoming elections so if you're planning to vote please do it right away! You can vote for your favorite charity once each day until September 6th. On that day, we will take the top three (3) charities, divide $50,000 proportionally, and send a check to each organization on behalf of Epitaph and you. That’s all there is to it. Thanks for helping us make a difference! Have your say  urlLink HERE !  Via  urlLink Epitaph

      From Dropkick Murphys own website:  Read it here, before it hits the news stands. A new DKM interview with AP on the "Rock Against Bush" compilation >>  AP Interview with the DKM  Is there a specific moment or story behind the song "We Got The Power"? "We Got The Power" is about the 1919 Boston Police strike and the people that lost their jobs as a result of it.  What are some political causes the DKMs as a whole supports? For the most part we have always been a band that has kept our beliefs pretty low key because we feel too many bands associate or support a political cause as a means to further their career by generating publicity in relation to these causes. In most cases we have preferred to take a different path for example doing individual work away from the spotlight of the band or if the involvement is directly related to the band we try to let the lyrics from our songs do the speaking for us because the world doesn't really need another high school dropout with a microphone holding political debates. However the most notable exceptions to that rule would be our strong relationship with the AFL-CIO, we have a good history of working together with them and we have a lot of respect for the people there especially Joe Ueline and President John Sweeny. We have also done several tours in support of anti-racist causes.  What inspired the DKMs to join the Rock Against Bush compilation? We want people to know that you don't need to be super liberal or anti-American to vote against the government that is in office. I would like to make it very clear we chose to be on this compilation simply because we're all Democrats and we would like to see our guy in office. We consider ourselves to all be patriotic, we love this country and we support our troops however that doesn't mean we have to agree with all the decisions that a guy who doesn't even fight comes up with.  Coming from Mass., what kind of insight do you have on John Kerry's political career in your home state? Well I'm no political analyst, as a kid that came from a strong pro-union family I was told to just shut up and vote Democrat however I do have a lot of respect for Kerry's ideas and his background. I think his biggest drawback is that he comes off as a bit robotic, he needs to loosen up and let people see more of his personal side.  Do the DKMs support Kerry's election campaign? Yes, we do support Kerry as the Democratic's candidate but it's hard for that to be a cut and dried answer as I don't think I would ever find myself agreeing with everything a politician had to say.  Outside of performing live, are there any other things the DKMs are doing to support the Rock Against Bush comp? No, were we supposed to?  Are there any other politically-minded compilations or any more politically-minded songs we should expect from you guys in the near future? I am sure there will be a lot more politically minded songs but probably not that many more compilations. As I said earlier this is a pretty rare thing for us.  You guys recently resurrected a century-old Boston Red Sox fight song called "Tessie."  What was the inspiration and reasoning behind re-writing the song? Free Red Sox tickets!!  Seriously though it's an honor to be involved in anything to do with the Red Sox, we've been fans since we were little kids. We even got to perform the National Anthem and "Tessie" on the field at Fenway Park before a Red Sox/Yankees game (especially a game that had a bench clearing brawl and a last inning rally for a Red Sox victory!).  What was the biggest challenge in maintaining the original integrity of "Tessie"? What integrity? The song was horrible, it was a hundred years old. We basically rewrote the whole song with just a hint of the original melody. We were more intrigued by the story behind the song (in the early 1900's rabid, drunken Red Sox fans would relentlessly sing "Tessie" to annoy the opposing team. The fans stopped singing "Tessie" after 1918 and the Red Sox have not won a World Series since).  urlLink dropkickmurphys.com

      Finch has officially been punk'd, and they only wish they had Ashton to blame.  Looks like the boys took a beat down from the guys in Disturbed.  If anyone has video of this we would love to host it on the site please send it our way.  Here is the official statement from Finch on the throwdown.  "To anyone who either witnessed or heard about today's incident at the Rolling Rock Town Fair. While we were setting up, one of the members of Disturbed, Dan Donegan, was harassing us from the side of the stage. Before we were to play, Randy (our guitarist) walked over to Dan to explain that the comments he made a few years ago were a joke, and to give him a friendly handshake. Dan proceeded to assault Randy and Disturbed's singer, David Draiman, attacked Mike Herrara (our drum tech) which caused a fight to ensue. We want everyone to know that Finch did not start this fight. However, we do not take kindly to being assaulted or having our lives threatened. We would like this little conflict to be resolved as soon as possible, but we will not give in to bullying bands threatening us or our fans."  Via  urlLink punk news.com

      Now we tend to ignore these types of stories, as they're usually 90% speculation and the result of a long stream of hearsay, but as this comes from the  urlLink Wall Street Journal  we'll let it through. Confirming internet rumors from the past few months, the paper is reporting (in an article titled "Politically Charged Music Pays -- At Least Until Election Day") that  urlLink Fat Wreck Chords ' outspoken  urlLink Anti-Flag  are the subject of a bidding war between several major labels. Specifically:  But now, Anti-Flag has become the unlikely subject of a furious bidding war, with offers in excess of $500,000 for a single album, says its lawyer, Anita Rivas. Since May, executives from Time Warner Inc.'s Sire Records, Sony Corp. and Bertelsmann AG's Columbia Records and RCA Records and Vivendi Universal SA's Geffen Records have been courting the band, in one case flying to Europe to meet the band on tour. Today the band is scheduled to meet with top brass at RCA and Columbia in New York.  We'll keep you up to date on this story if and when something concrete is announced.

      Well you know the saying "If you want something done do it yourself". Well that's what OAC Records has decided to do. OAC Records now have their own night at a SO. Cal. club for puting on anti-pay-to-play shows. No band playing these shows will have to sell tickets. The venue is small, in the ghetto of downtown San Bernardino, and the kids are on the corner spanging for ticket money, but OAC Records wouldn't have it any other way. They are in the process of setting up anti-pay-to-play shows with other venue owners so stay tuned for more nights hopefully through out California. Pay-To-Play cause competition in the scene and turns it into a popularity contest, the band with the most friends gets to play the show type of crap. This creates an elitest attitude amongst most of the more popular bands. Punk is not an elitest thing!  urlLink www.punknska.com

      Hey everyone...well Warped Tour is soon upon us and I am sooo excited...Bouncing Souls ...YAY!!!  Well I'm glad that I have some good shit coming up soon cuz I am going completely crazy with my life right now...I hate the city that I live in and everything around me seems to be failing BUT I hopefully have Boston to look forward to and Warped Tour and WWE Raw all in the same week.  So yeah I have one more week to wait before the week from hell but the best week of the year.   So it is 2:03am and I have had the worst week of sleep so if this makes no sense that is why but hopefully that is just stress of the Hell/best week.  Cheers all!

      It's been over two years since Winnipeg's favourite sons released Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes. Here's an update on their follow up: After months of trying to figure out the where's and who's and how's, we have finally confirmed that we will start recording our next full length record in november. This bastard will smoke you fucks out of your holes. Good-night poser-bands of every genre. Nice knowing you. It's been reported that  urlLink Propagandhi  is shooting for a February release, but nothing official has been announced yet.  Via  urlLink Punknews

      Funk legend Rick James was found dead this morning, presumably of natural causes. He was 56. James, best known for his 1981 hit "Super Freak," had received a recent surge of popularity due to Dave Chappelle's lampooning of him on the Chappelle Show. While James struggled for much of his life with drug addiction, authorities say there appeared to be no drugs involved with his death; in the coming weeks, an autopsy will confirm or deny that thought. You can read more  urlLink here .Our condolences go out to the family and friends of Rick James.  Via  urlLink Punk News

      Long time  urlLink Social Distortion  bassist John Maurer has left the band, to be succeeded by  urlLink Rancid 's Matt Freeman. Here's the press release in full: After 20 years of serving as Social Distortion’s bass player John Maurer has decided to leave the band. Maurer completed the recording of “Sex, Love and Rock and Roll’, the new Social Distortion full length studio recording but has decided to forgo the usual extended promotion and touring in order to stay home and devote time to his wife and two children. “ For the better part of twenty years I would finish making a record and then leave my home and family for long periods of time”, Maurer said. “It was a blast and I have great memories but the hiatus between records in the past six years has given me a chance to develop other interests at home and hang with my family. I just don’t want to leave.” Mike Ness commented, “ I have known John since junior high. I respect what he is doing but we will sure miss him a lot.” Matt Freeman, one of the premier bass players in punk rock, has come aboard for this record cycle. “Rancid is always going to be my priority”, Matt said. “But Tim has the Transplants and Lars has the Bastards. I like to think I have a pretty cool side band now too.” Ness said the decision to call Freeman was only complicated by Matt’s well-known loyalty for Rancid. “We asked ourselves who the best guy out there was and it was Matt. We figured there was no way but it looks like Rancid is going to have just enough down time for us to keep Matt busy. These shows are going to be real special with him in the band.” Social Distortion’s new record, “Sex, Love and Rock and Roll’ is due in stores September 28th. The DVD documentary, “Live in OC” was released on July 27th. The band begins touring in August and plan to be on the road through 2005.  Via  urlLink punknews

      From  hulud.com : Since the completion of Shai Hulud's That Within Blood Ill-Tempered members Matt Fox and Matt Fletcher have been writing material for their next album. Though circumstances have led the band to part ways with singer Geert van der Velde, and change the name to The Warmth Of Red Blood, assuredly the new music and lyrics are a continuation and progression that still finds Shai Hulud's message, style, and sound intact. Fox and Fletcher are looking for a full-time vocalist for The Warmth Of Red Blood. Head to the band's website for details on the type of singer that they're looking for and to download an instrumental version of the song "Whether To Cry Or Destroy" from Shai Hulud's That Within Blood Ill-Tempered. Applicants can use it to demo their vocals when applying.

      Oh sure, there have been plenty of jokes about the Govenator, but we here at Fat deliver them with panache. And sometimes with references that no one will appreciate. What's this latest news we're getting at? It appears that NOFX will be performing on some "Late Show" hosted by some dude named Conan on August 10th. I can already hear the lamentations of the women.  Via  urlLink fat wreck chords

      Some new tour dates have gone up now, namely shows for Brisbane hip hop hedonists Butterfingers, as well as a short notice run of dates for Sydney's iOTA and his new band, The Lizard Men. Also, seeing as how it seems to be a popular facet of the site at the moment, the infamous Frenzal Rhomb vs Austereo Network interview can still be found on the  urlLink black hole  page. If anyone has the chance to catch MediaWatch on the ABC next Monday August 2, please do as they are running a feature on Austereo and this whole sorry mess they've landed themselves in. Who knows, maybe I'll even put some new CD reviews up sometime for the bands who are touring. Which would probably mean me buying their CDs. Yeah, you might have to wait a bit for that one...

The fine folks at Warped Tour have issued a reminder not to buy tickets from scalpers outside of the venues - it's no surprise that they're selling fake tickets.

      Rolling Stone has  urlLink revealed  more details on the unreleased  urlLink Clash  material that will be included on London Calling: The 25th Anniversary Edition. Guitarist Mick Jones unearthed the material last March while rummaging through some boxes in his London home. He discovered a set of homemade recording tapes that had been missing for twenty-five years, long rumored amongst fans who dubbed them the "The Vanilla Tapes." They contain demo versions of fifteen songs that would end up on the London Calling, plus six unreleased songs, including a cover of Bob Dylan's "Man in Me." Also included are early versions of "London Calling" (with alternate lyrics) and "Death or Glory." The legacy edition of the album is due on September 21st. It will be a three disc set, the first disc being the remastered original album, the second will be a DVD with interviews and footage of the London Calling sessions, the third will be the material on The Vanilla Tapes.

      Hardcore enthusiasts take note, cuz  urlLink To The Nines  is what you asked Santa for last Winter. Only Crime's debut full length will not disappoint and it's hard not to drop names when the band is made up of members like Russ from Good Riddance, Bill from Descendents, and Aaron from Bane! That's pedigree. With that shameless stuff out of the way, you should know that if you order it through Fat mailorder you also get a free Only Crime pin with your order of  urlLink To The Nines . How can you repay us for this generosity? Have a look at their smokin' hot e-card:  urlLink http://www.fatwreck.com/junk/oc.html

      We've got some monumental news here folks.  urlLink Rock Against Bush Vol. II  will be out August 10th and and this one is looking to be bigger and better than the first one. Among the 28 tracks we give ya 20 unreleased/rare songs from bands like Green Day, Lagwagon, The Lawrence Arms, Dwarves, Yellowcard, The Unseen, Foo Fighters and shitloads more. On top of all that greatness, we're also including a DVD with: videos from bands like Alkaline Trio and NOFX; Comedy pieces from Will Ferrell and others; and six informative political shorts. Bush is doomed! Seriously though, there's TONS of great stuff on this comp and it's real cheap. Six bucks from us, in fact, which brings us to the next point. We start taking mailorders for this epic comp on 8/4 and those orders will come with a free "Rock Against Bush" bumper sticker. While they last of course. And if you reside on the East Coast, the fine people working the Punk Voter booth will be selling the comps on the Warped Tour as early as August 4th. All that said, you probably wanna hear some music off this thing before you blow your entire allowance on it, and that's where this e-card comes in.

      Out of the Herd and Into the Head of Nick 13 Hot Topic: Describe your writing process before entering the studio. Nick 13: Normally, a song is completely written when I bring it to the practice room. That process might take me days, months or even years, depending on the song. When I show it to the guys, I've got the bass lines, basic drum arrangements, etc. From there, if they have an idea about a note here or there or an arrangement thing, they'll bounce it off me, but because they haven't heard all the elements of the song until it's recorded, they understand if it doesn't work. Likewise, sometimes I'll bounce stuff off of them, like "What sounds better? This or this?" The way I write, I'm hearing the complete song in my head with vocal melody and any applicable harmonies or production elements, even when it's just on an acoustic guitar or whatever…  urlLink Read on click here...
