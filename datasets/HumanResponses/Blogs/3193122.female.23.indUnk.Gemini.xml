      Good day! Im so tired today. Probably after all those house moving things, packing, unpacking, basketballing on Sat & east coasting on Sun... im so drained. Wah, still thinking of going jogging later.. must be crazy.... think i should go home & rest. Preparing for glorify (worship) tomorrow for cell too. Yah, I should rest.   On Sun at east coast, I learned a profound truth. Being one of the game IC for "finding nemo", I have to go through all the games first. One of them is "fear factor". We are suppose to put our hands inside a covered box & to pick up 1 coin. The box is filled with some unknown things. so u can imagine our fear man... & all of us, except one is female. There are 2 tests. For the first, I failed to pick up the coin because for the 3 times I tried, something just touched my hand & even flew out! I couldnt figure out what was it. The 2nd test came..... this time, many commented that it wasnt as scary.... & JUST before my turn, Yiwei came to me & said,.... "dun worry, it s like dry flower petals buds" so I confidently went over & put my hands in. In  my MIND, I was confident that they were non-living things in the box.... & they were harmless flower buds.   So I placed my hand into that box & stirred & stirred in order to get out the little coin. Yeah, I succeeded!   Very happy with my braveness. When they revealed what was inside the box, I went forward to take a better view. Guess what, there were many WORMS inside the box!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I screamed & ran as fast as I could out from the sight of what I saw. My heartbeat increased! Wahhhhhhhh, I played with worms just now!!!  arhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! Man, that was REALLI DISGUSTING!!!  After that eventful day, I went home with a new mindset, I CAN DO ALL THINGS WHEN I THINK I CAN.   When I imagine the things to be flower buds, I can put my hand into the box & play with it.  I thought to myself, if I have knew that the things were worms, I wouldnt do it even if Im paid a hundred bucks.  But I just did it!   Well, its all in the mind! When I think I can, I CAN!!!  Thank God for that revelation & 'wonderful' experience.

      Last night I went for the last series of "Holy Spirit encounter" prayer meetings. It was great. I sense a breakthrough in my spirit. I will change! I will not be the same! I wept alot.. God did show up & touched me once again.    "I want to let Jesus loves me, put His hands around me.  Bring me high so I can see how beautiful I am. I want to let Jesus loves me, put His arms around me, touched the sky so I can see how wonderful He is"   Sometimes, being a Christian for so many years... we lose the touch of the Father's love.   We know so much that we fail to recognise that he basics of it all is that God is a loving Father. Always desiring for us to just love him back.  "Not to strive, we don't have to strive for his love. His love is abundant... more than enough always."

       TRUST...Lean not on my own understanding... let go of it all.... God will bring me through.    "Trust in the LORD with all your heart  and lean not on your own understanding;  6 in all your ways acknowledge him,  and he will make your paths straight."  Prov 3:5  This is one verse I held close to my heart when I was studying for NTU's examination. Every time, I felt that it was impossible to finish revising for exams, I will look at this verse and trust.   Now, I look at this verse & it still applies to every areas of my life... not only examinations.  TRUST is one word that requires alot of our heart to truly embrace it. TRUSTing is not by looking at the circumstances & situations that we are facing... trusting is not by knowing facts... trust is not something that you can understand with our human mind. Trust takes alot of our heart. It requires a close/intimate relationship with the person whom you are trusting.   TRUST may be a simple 5 letters words. But to me, trusting requires true faith.   There are so many things in our life that we need to trust God for. Our career direction, our life partner, our family salvations, our destiny.   As human, we doubt sometimes. Especially when things go wrong, the road seems harder to walk, when everything appear just opposite of what we wish to see, when we can't even see the future that lies ahead of us... we need to TRUST.  We need to come back to God. Know Him & let go of it all. It is not easy. It will not be easy. But God never promise that it will be easy. He only promises that He will be there to hold us if we fall & He will be there to make it through with us.   God's ways are higher than mine.   Let us TRUST in an unfailing GOD. Because He deserves all our TRUST.

        Putting Love Into Practice   Read: Matthew 5:11-16    Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. —Matthew 5:16     In his book Christians in the Marketplace, Bill Hybels says that people outside the faith often say, "Show me" before they say, "Tell me."   I knew a young man in Germany named Wolfgang who modeled Hybels' principle at a building site where he worked. As an enthusiastic believer, Wolfgang always read his Bible during lunch. Though his fellow workers jeered, he didn't stop his daily reading. He simply prayed for a way to demonstrate Christ's love to them.   When the workers went home at night, they always left their muddy boots behind. Wolfgang began staying late after work to clean their boots. The men were puzzled at first but then realized that Wolfgang was the only one among them who would perform this humble service. Not only did they come to respect him, but sometimes they even asked him to read the Bible to them. Only eternity will reveal the full effect of Wolfgang's shining life. But this we know: When his co-workers saw his good works, they started listening to his God.   Jesus said, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may . . . glorify your Father in heaven" (Matthew 5:16). If you long to lead the people around you to Jesus, radiate His love by doing practical deeds for God's glory alone. —Joanie Yoder    My life was dark until the Light shone in, That Light was Christ, who saved me from my sin; His light that I've received I long to share In loving deeds for people everywhere. —Hess  A Christian's life is a window through which others can see Jesus.

       HUGS!!!   I love hugs... learn to hug my friends when I was 17 years old.   There's something in a simple hug That always warms the heart;  It welcomes us back home And makes it easier to part. A hug's a way to share the joy And sad times we go through, Or just a way for friends to say hey I like you 'cause you're you. Hugs are meant for anyone For whom we really care, from your grandma to your neighbor, Or a cuddly teddy bear. A hug is an amazing thing - it's just the perfect way  To show the love we're feeling But can't find the words to say. It's funny how a little hug Makes everyone feel good; In every place and language, It's always understood. And hugs don't need new equipment, Special batteries or parts - Just open up your arms And open up your hearts.

      " Gentleness  requires tremendous strength.  Gentleness is having the  power not to react when everything about the circumstance says you should.  Gentleness is the beginning of learning what love is all about."  ~ Shale Paul in The Warrior Within  I've learned that no matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it may be better tomorrow.  I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she handles a rainy day and lost luggage.  I've learned that regardless of your relationship with your parents, you'll miss them when they're gone from your life.  I've learned that making a"living"is not the same thing as making a "life."  I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance.  I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both hands. You need to be able to throw something back.  I've learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart, I usually make the right decision.  I've learned that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one.  I've learned that every day you should reach out and touch someone.  People love that human touch - holding hands, a warm hug, or just a friendly pat on the back.  I've learned that I still have a lot to learn.

       Running For Others     Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but . . . let each esteem others better than himself. —Philippians 2:3   Tom Knapp never won a race during his entire high school track career. Tom was a "pusher." It was his task to set the pace for his fellow team members, who would then beat him to the finish line. When he ran a successful race, he was enabling a fellow teammate to win. Even though Tom never had enough reserve energy for the final sprint to victory, the coach considered him a valuable member of the team.   In a similar way, the New Testament tells us to run our race of faith with the success of others in mind. "Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others" (Philippians 2:3-4). Our example of such living is Jesus Christ, who left the glory of heaven to share our humanity and die on the cross so that we can have eternal life (vv.5-8).   If the encouragement of our example helps another person to flourish and be successful, we should rejoice. When the eternal prizes are awarded for faithful service to God, a lot of "pushers" will be wearing blue ribbons. Until then, let's keep running so that others can win. —David McCasland    Oh, to see the needs of others More important than our own, Following our Lord's example When He left His heavenly throne. —Sper  You can't lose when you help others win.

      Will I ever find God? nice one! http://www.quickinspirations.com/flash/find_God.asp   PSALm 23   The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.  He makes me lie down in green pastures,  he leads me beside quiet waters, he restores my soul.  He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  I will fear no evil, for you are with me;  your rod and your staff, they comfort me.   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.  You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life,  and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.

        Come Walk With Me         Come walk with me just one more mile Before you call it quits Forget about the broken dreams Now broken into bits.  Put one more foot out, forward Another, right in step Just keep your eyes locked to the front We are not finished yet.  Keep your mind on the road ahead Not what you left behind If you can just keep on moving Wherever this road winds.  You might find a few surprises Might even make you smile You might even see life clearer While walking for a while.   You might even find some pieces You missed along the way Or some new ones that are better To use another day.  So another mile together No need to go alone Just continue with your journey Your quest is not yet done.   ~ Adriaan ~

       Mrs. Thompson and Teddy     Her name was Mrs. Thompson and his was 'Teddy'.  As she stood in front of her 5th grade class on the very first day of school, she told the children a lie. Like most teachers, she looked at her students and said that she loved them all the same.  But that was impossible, because there in the front row, slumped in his seat, was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard.  Mrs. Thompson had watched Teddy the year before and noticed that he didn't play well with the other children, that his clothes were messy and that he constantly needed a bath. And Teddy could be unpleasant.  It got to the point where Mrs. Thompson would actually take delight in marking his papers with a broad red pen, making bold X's and then putting a big "F" at the top of his papers.  At the school where Mrs. Thompson taught, she was required to review each child's past records and she put Teddy's off until last. However, when she reviewed his file, she was in for a surprise.  Teddy's first grade teacher wrote, "Teddy is a bright child with a ready laugh. He does his work neatly and has good manners ... he is a joy to be around."  His second grade teacher wrote, "Teddy is an excellent student, well liked by his classmates, but he is troubled because his mother has a terminal illness and life at home must be a struggle."  His third grade teacher wrote, "His mother's death had been hard on him. He tries to do his best, but his father doesn't show much interest and his home life will soon affect him if some steps aren't taken."  Teddy's fourth grade teacher wrote, "Teddy is withdrawn and doesn't show much interest in school. He doesn't have many friends and he sometimes sleeps in class".  By now, Mrs Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of herself. She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas presents, wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper, except for Teddy's. His present was clumsily wrapped in the heavy, brown paper that he got from a grocery bag. Mrs Thompson took pains to open it in the middle of the other presents.  Some of the children started to laugh when she found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones missing, and a bottle that was one quarter full of perfume. But she stifled the children's laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was, putting it on, and dabbing some of the perfume on her wrist.  Teddy Stoddard stayed after school that day just long enough to say, "Mrs. Thompson, today you smelled just like my Mom used to." After the children left she cried for at least an hour.  On that very day, she quit teaching reading, and writing, and arithmetic. Instead, she began to teach children.  Mrs. Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy. As she worked with him, his mind seemed to come alive. The more she encouraged him, the faster he responded. By the end of the year, Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class and, despite her lie that she would love all the children the same, Teddy became one of her "teacher's pets."  A year later, she found a note under her door, from Teddy, telling her that she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life. Six years went by before she got another note from Teddy. He then wrote that he had finished high school, third in his class, and she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life.  Four years after that, she got another letter, saying that while things had been tough at times, he'd stayed in school, had stuck with it, and would soon graduate from college with the highest of honors. He assured Mrs.Thompson that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had in his whole life.  Then four more years passed and yet another letter came. This time he explained that after he got his bachelor's degree, he decided to go a little further. The letter explained that she was still the best and favourite teacher he ever had. But now his name was a little longer - The letter was signed, Theodore F. Stoddard, MD.  The story doesn't end there. You see, there was yet another letter that spring. Teddy said he'd met this girl and was going to be married. He explained that his father had died a couple of years ago and he was wondering if Mrs. Thompson might agree to sit in the place at the wedding that was usually reserved for the mother of the groom. Of course, Mrs Thompson did.  And guess what? She wore that bracelet, the one with several rhinestones missing. And she made sure she was wearing the perfume that Teddy remembered his mother wearing on their last Christmas together. They hugged each other, and Dr. Stoddard whispered in Mrs.Thompson's ear, "Thank you, Mrs. Thompson, for believing in me. Thank you so much for making me feel important and showing me that I could make a difference."  Mrs. Thompson, with tears in her eyes, whispered back. She said, "Teddy, you have it all wrong. You were the one who taught me that I could make a difference. I didn't know how to teach until I met you."  Warm someone's heart today ... pass this along. Please remember that wherever you go, and whatever you do, you will have the opportunity to touch and/or change a person's outlook. And please try to do it in a positive way.  "Friends lift us to our feet ."

       Ascended!  We are . . . well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.—2 Corinthians 5:8  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Joseph Parker (1830-1902) was a beloved English preacher. When his wife died, he didn't have the customary wording inscribed on her gravestone. Instead of the word died followed by the date of her death, he chose the word ascended. Parker found great comfort in being reminded that though his wife's body had been placed in the grave, the "real" Mrs. Parker had been transported to heaven and into the presence of her Savior. When Parker himself died, his friends made sure that his gravestone read:   ASCENDED NOVEMBER 28, 1902   When a believing loved one dies, or when we ourselves face the process of dying, there's great comfort in the fact  that "to be absent from the body" is "to be present with the Lord" (2 Corinthians 5:8)   Death for us is not a dark journey into the unknown. It is not a lonely walk into a strange and friendless place. Rather, it is a glorious transition from the trials of earth into the joys of heaven, where we will be reunited with our loved ones in Christ who have gone before. Best of all, we will enjoy the presence of our Lord forever.   Yes, when a believer dies, the body is buried but not the soul. It has ascended! —Richard De Haan   Oh, how blessed is the promise When our spirit is set free: To be absent from the body Means to live, O Lord, with Thee! —Bosch   For the Christian, death is the doorway to Glory.

      wow wow wow!!! Last week has indeed been truly an exciting, challenging & amazing time/experience for me!  I have been looking forward to a time of refreshment & relaxation & definately a break from my work!!!! Yeah, been to LANJUT for a 3 days 2 nights camp! It was great! A time of play & also intimacy with God. Thank God! :)   I stayed in a very traditional hut with I wei, Julia & Emily. Though it wasnt as nice as the other more luxourous apartments that other campers get to stay, I thank God 'cos it was a fun experience staying in a hut, suit the beach theme!   After some games on the first day, I went alone to the beach for some time alone with God & myself! Wah, I had travelled for so long.... 4 hours bus ride.....to this place... I better visit my fav. beach & enjoy!!!!! I only have 2 days here yah. :p  Great beach.... sea........ wow!!! hahaa..........   Service at night was great too. Pastor Wilson shared on 2 Samuel 11.  ~David is a man after God's heart. ~David is like anyone of us ~God is always reaching out to touch us ~God's anointing is on David  *David's downfall ~ spirit of boredom ~causes temptation to set in -->take time to seek the Lord -->if you think that you are standing strong, be CAREFUL THAT YOU DO NOT SIN -->work out your salvation with fear & trembling  ~God sees every unfair treatment. Hang in there & TRUST that God will intervene ~God wants to restore you ~God is eternity who will not forget His promises.    Tue's morning (01 June 04) 2nd day     I woke up at 6am but lazed around till 7am. When I had finished my wash up, gosh... I missed the sun rise!!! Thinking that it was the last day at the resort, sadness creeped in & I was sad.  "Do not think that you have miss it, tomorrow you are still here!" Oh ya!!! The next day, I will still be here at the resort! I can see my sun rise tomorrow!!!   God spoke,"Like the sun-rise that I made for you every morning, my love & mercy are new every morning too. Do not think that you have miss it for I will come & bring you a new one!"  Wow, because there are some regrets in my life (even though I tell myself that I will not regret in life), when I think abt some incidents, I will always think that I have missed it. But God just came & tell me that I HAVE NOT MISSED IT for He will always bring a new one in my life! :) Praise Him!    O Lord, my Father in heaven Your ways are higher than my ways O Lord, where can I go? O where can I seek help from? Who can love me with an everlasting love? Who brings the sunrise every morning? Who scoop up the sea with thy hands? It is none other than You, my father."                In the morning, I had to miss the “singles” workshop to serve the children. Thank God for the great time with the kids & I even knew a buddy that day!  A smart & witty 12 year old boy! So smart & intelligent I was amazed! Haha……. I knew He was different. I sensed it. That he will be someone great in the future. I met some really cute kids that day… man… it was great!  In the afternoon, we had some free time. I played pool with Jean, played table-tennis, ate ice-cream IN THE SWIMMING POOL! Haha…. GREAT! Just jumped into the pool with my clothes on & ate ice-cream too. Then went cycling…. Hee…great!  At night, Pastor Wilson prophesized into some people's lives. He prophesised into that boy’s life (my buddy). He spoke specifically that He will grows up to be used greatly by God! Wow, I was like, yah… I knew it! Praise God! Then one of them was,  “ My daughter, I will restore to you what you have lost.” I have not forgotten what you have asked, I will grant you the desires of your heart.” It will come to pass.”  I felt that it was for me. I have lost a lot of things… but God is restoring them back to me. Hallelujah!!!  “Accept your past & move forward. Don’t try to understand your past. Accept it & thank God for all the past. For all the past built up to who you are today!  “O Abba Father, You who created the sun, the sea & all that is in the world. Lord, You are the great Almighty, the creator of the universe. Why should I worry? Why do I doubt? Where do I take refuge? You Lord is my provider. You alone can satisfy all I ever needed.  (listening to the sea) God, You are making music for me!”                                                                                            ~shirley   “My daughter, I will  restore to you all you have asked of me.”     02 June last day (Cloudy morning)    I woke up early to see the sunrise. It was cloudy that morning. But I wasn’t disappointed at all. God makes one everyday! Why sad? Hahahaaaaa  Ok, that’s all…. To be continue 

      The Empty Easter Egg  Jeremy was born with a twisted body and a slow mind. At the age of 12 he was still in second grade, seemingly unable to learn. His teacher, Doris Miller, often became exasperated with him. He would squirm in his seat, drool, and make grunting noises. At other times, he spoke clearly and distinctly, as if a spot of light had penetrated the darkness of his brain. Most of the time, however, Jeremy just irritated his teacher.  One day she called his parents and asked them to come in for a consultation. As the Forresters entered the empty classroom, Doris said to them, "Jeremy really belongs in a special school. It isn't fair to him to be with younger children who don't have learning problems. Why, there is a five year gap between his age and that of the other students."   Mrs. Forrester cried softly into a tissue, while her husband spoke. "Miss Miller," he said, "there is no school of that kind nearby. It would be a terrible shock for Jeremy if we had to take him out of this school. We know he really likes it here."    Doris sat for a long time after they had left, staring at the snow outside the window. Its coldness seemed to seep into her soul. She wanted to sympathize with the Forresters. After all, their only child had a terminal illness. But it wasn't fair to keep him in her class. She had 18 other youngsters to teach, and Jeremy was a distraction. Furthermore, he would never learn to read and write. Why waste any more time trying?  As she pondered the situation, guilt washed over her. Here I am she thought. Lord, please help me to be more patient with Jeremy. From that day on, she tried hard to ignore Jeremy's noises and his blank stares.  Then one day, he limped to her desk, dragging his bad leg behind him. "I love you, Miss Miller," he exclaimed, loud enough for the whole class to hear. The other students snickered, and Doris' face turned red.   She stammered, "Wh--why that's very nice, Jeremy. N--now please take your seat."   Spring came, and the children talked excitedly about the coming of Easter. Doris told them the story of Jesus, and then to emphasize the idea of new life springing forth, she gave each of the children a large plastic egg.    "Now," she said to them, "I want you to take this home and bring it back tomorrow with something inside that shows new life. Do you understand?"  >"Yes, Miss Miller," the children responded enthusiastically --all except for Jeremy. He listened intently; his eyes never left her face. He did not even make his usual noises. Had he understood what she had said about Jesus' death and resurrection? Did he understand the assignment?  Perhaps she should call his parents and explain the project to them. That evening, Doris' kitchen sink stopped up. She called the landlord and waited an hour for him to come by and unclog it. After that, she still had to shop for groceries, iron a blouse, and prepare a vocabulary test for the next day. She completely forgot about phoning Jeremy's parents.  The next morning, 19 children came to school,laughing and talking as they placed their eggs in the large wicker basket on Miss Miller's desk. After they completed their math lesson, it was time to open the eggs.    In the first egg, Doris found a flower.  "Oh yes, a flower is certainly a sign of new life," she said. "When plants peek through the ground, we know that spring is here."  A small girl in the first row waved her arm. "That's my egg, Miss Miller," she called out.   The next egg contained a plastic butterfly, which looked very real. Doris held it up.  "We all know that a caterpillar changes and grows into a beautiful butterfly. Yes, that's new life, too."  Little Judy smiled proudly and said, "Miss Miller, that one is mine."  Next, Doris found a rock with moss on it. She explained that moss, too, showed life.  Billy spoke up from the back of the classroom, "My daddy helped me," he beamed.  Then Doris opened the fourth egg. She gasped. The egg was empty.    Surely it must be Jeremy's she thought, and of course, he did not understand her instructions. If only she had not forgotten to phone his parents. Because she did not want to embarrass him, she quietly set the egg aside and reached for another.  Suddenly, Jeremy spoke up. "Miss Miller, aren't you going to talk about my egg?"  Flustered, Doris replied, "But Jeremy, your egg is empty."  He looked into her eyes and said softly, "Yes, but Jesus' tomb was empty, too."  Time stopped. When she could speak again, Doris asked him, "Do you know why the tomb was empty?"  "Oh, yes," Jeremy said, "Jesus was killed and put in there. Then His Father raised Him up."  The recess bell rang. While the children excitedly ran out to the schoolyard, Doris cried. The cold inside her melted completely away.  Three months later, Jeremy died. Those who paid their respects at the funeral home were surprised to see 19 eggs on top of his casket, all of them empty.    ~ Author Unknown ~

       Those Who Love You     If anyone should hurt you And say a thing unkind, Remember what I tell you, And keep these things in mind.  For every one who makes you cry, There are three who make you smile, And a smile will last a long, long time, But a tear just a little while!  If someone says a thing that's cruel, Don't let it get to you, There's so much good about you, And your faults are very few.  So if a certain someone Should act a certain way, Just think of those who love you And don't let it ruin your day.  Don't let someone who hates the world Cause you to hate it too, For behind the clouds is a golden sun, And a sky that's bright and blue!

       wow wow must write down my "buying dig cam experience" before I sleep. I finally went to buy my dig cam on last Sunday! Hahaha.... after researching on all the cameras online & checking out all the prices everywhere, I finally bought my Canon PowerShot A75 at $440!!! with free 128 SD memory card!!! wow wow... i love my camera!!! And with sponser from my sis of 400 bucks, i only need to pay $40!!! hahaa... Praise God!    &nbsp;  Yaya, on Sunday, met up with Chi keung to buy the digcam together 'cos he wanted to buy one too. So, I decided to go to luckyplaza to buy as Esther told me they should have some great deal. The first few shops we went into, the owners looked at us & served with the "ya.. I know you won't buy in the end" attitude. Being very particular about customer service, I walked out when the services weren good.    Very important to&nbsp;have great attitude when&nbsp;selling things. But I cant blame them, 'cos there are abt 200+ shops that sell cameras there!!! They probably face lots of rejections from customers!    &nbsp;  So I just walked around & true enough, everywhere I go, there are cameras shops all around!!! Li &amp; Shan joined us at 5pm. I was really tired by just walking around & asking for the diff. prices they are offering.     &nbsp;  After that, we walked into this shop with a "golden hair" shop assistant. His attitude was fine at first, then I realised he love to lie. He will lie about many things! Hmm..... even when the prices he quoted for us are quite attractive, I didn't feel good about buying from him Not his appearance but his attitude. "liar" attitude.     &nbsp;  So after shopping around from 2.45pm to 6.00pm.... we were all very tired..... then I told them this, "I must get the dig cam today"   No point coming down again & start this tedious exercise again. One thing they know abt me is that Im a person who really make sure my money is spent properly. Very frugal!     &nbsp;  Then I pulled them aside & said, "let's pray!"    &nbsp;  So, I prayed with all&nbsp;our eyes wide open, so that people won't notice us. I prayed a simple prayer that God will help me get the best deal!     &nbsp;  Straight after that, we turned & walked... &amp; a man looked at me & said "You want PowerShot A75? I offer you 440."     &nbsp;  My eyes lit up, he actually offered me 470 as the lowest deal jus some time ago.&nbsp;Other shops offer 499 which is the retail offer price everywhere, set by Canon. Wow, and surprisingly his attitude was very good!!! He sounded very honest & frank. After quite some time looking at the product &amp; sensing... I decided to get it! I knew God had blessed me with this great deal!    &nbsp;  There is free 128 memory card & I just realised that he gave me 4 rechargable 2300 batteries!!! wow, hmm.... I love my cam, it was great! Great pic! OK..... Thank God!   :) smile    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

        I was reading on     the gospel for Asia   & came upon this letter. Hope it will bless your heart.        &nbsp;   More persecution stories at   urlLink  http://www.gfa.org/gfa/persecution        &nbsp;   Let's pray for all those who are suffering hardship for the extension of His kingdom & for simply loving our Lord.       &nbsp;     &nbsp;   07/01/2004: Letter from K.P. about Manja       Dear Family,    &nbsp;  I know it’s hard to hear the    news about our brother Manja    not being released like we prayed and hoped he would. Sometimes we don’t understand why these things happen. In the Bible we learn a very valuable lesson in the area of disappointments. Usually disappointments are the result of the way we feel about something that turned out differently than we had planned or hoped. There are two kinds of disappointments: those that are in our control, and those that are not in our control. For example, if a student doesn’t study and gets bad grades, his disappointment is in his control. However, a flight that is late, causing you to lose your connection, is out of your control.     &nbsp;  Two Scriptures that give us some insight into why we get disappointed and how we should respond: "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways," says the LORD.     &nbsp;  "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts" (Isaiah 55:8-9, NKJV).     &nbsp;  "And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose" (Romans 8:28, NKJV).     &nbsp;  It's easy to believe these two Scriptures when things are going well, but when things are going opposite of what we expect, it’s harder to believe what God says here.     &nbsp;  Because we see, touch, taste, hear and smell – our five senses tell us what we believe to be real, but as A.W. Tozer says in his book The Pursuit of God, “The visible becomes the enemy of the invisible; the temporal, of the eternal.” To truly believe what God is doing behind the visible, we must exercise our total trust and faith in God that He knows what He is doing, and that He is still in control even though the world around us may look out of control. Think about three men in the Bible – Joseph, Moses and Peter. We consider each of them to be a great leader and man who knew the Lord. But do you realize that it was through great disappointments that God made them to be who they were? Without the difficulties that they faced, they would have never been what God made them to be.     &nbsp;  There are three things that will help us respond in the right way to our disappointment.     &nbsp;  1. We need to look at this situation from God’s point of view – we look at the physical, but God looks beyond that to the spiritual.     &nbsp;  2. If we can follow the first one, the second one is easy. We need to rejoice, knowing that God is in control. Paul tells us to rejoice ‘for’ and ‘in’ every situation.     &nbsp;  3. If we can apply the second one, we can easily follow the third, which is to trust the Lord to work things out. One of the first questions that comes to mind when we hear that our brother Manja was not released is, 'was it because I didn’t pray enough?' Or, 'was there something I could have done more to get him free?' And the answer is no.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;The Lord is in control and maybe he did answer our prayers, but in a way we didn’t hope or expect. And now we must trust Him, believing He will work everything out. If you could read what our GFA field leader in Nepal wrote, you would see a calmness and a peace that tell us our staff there know God is in control. They are disappointed, but their disappointment doesn’t overcome their faith in God’s sovereign plan.     &nbsp;  It almost seems that we are more disappointed than they are. Our leader told me that “we know God is in control and He is faithful.” Let us continue to pray and believe that the Lord will make a way for Manja to be free.    &nbsp;  Yours for the unreached millions,   K.P. Yohannan

        Psalm for today! Psalm 15     &nbsp;  Who may worship in your santuary, Lord?    &nbsp;  Who may enter your presence on your holy hill?    &nbsp;  Those who lead blameless lives & do what is right,    &nbsp;   speaking the truths from sincere hearts .    &nbsp;  Those who  refuse to slander others  or harm their neighbours    &nbsp;  or  speak evil  of their friends.    &nbsp;  Those who  despise persistent sinners ,    &nbsp;  and  honor the faithful  followers of the LORD    &nbsp;  and  keep their promises even it hurts .    &nbsp;  Those who  do not charge interest  on the money they lend,    &nbsp;  and who  refuse to accept bribes  to testify against the innocent.    &nbsp;   Such people will   stand firm forever  .

        A BEAUTIFUL ANALOGY!    A man went to a barbershop to have his hair cut and his beard trimmed.As the barber began to work, they began to have a good conversation.They talked about so many things and various subjects.When they eventually touched on the subject of God, the barber said: "Idon't believe that God exists.""Why do you say that?" asked the customer."Well, you just have to go out in the street to realize that God doesn'texist.&nbsp; Tell me, if God exists, would there be so many sick people?Would there be abandoned children?&nbsp; If God existed, there would beneither suffering nor pain. I can't imagine a loving a God who wouldallow all of these things."The customer thought for a moment, but didn't respond because he didn'twant to start an argument.The barber finished his job and the customer left the shop. Just afterhe left the barbershop, he saw a man in the street with long, stringy,dirty hair and an untrimmed beard. He looked dirty and unkempt.The customer turned back and entered the barber shop again and he saidto the barber: "You know what? Barbers do not exist.""How can you say that?" asked the surprised barber."I am here, and I am a barber. And I just worked on you!""No!" the customer exclaimed. "Barbers don't exist because if they did,there would be no people with dirty long hair and untrimmed beards, likethat man outside.""Ah, but barbers DO exist! " answered the barber. " What happens, is,people do not come to me. ""Exactly!"- affirmed the customer. "That's the point! God, too, DOESexist! What happens, is, people don't go to Him and do not look for Him.That's why there's so much pain and suffering in the world."

      Dear God, We thank you for this beautiful new day You have made. Help us recognize that we have many things in life because of your blessings upon our lives.

We thank you for Your faithfulness.  Lord, grant us the strength & wisdom we need for today. You know there are alot to accomplish today. But help us take one day at a time &amp; not worry about tomorrow.  Bless us indeed.Your hands be upon us, enlarge our territory & keep us away from all evil. Lord, even when troubles come, let us remember to hold on &amp; never give up in believing. Believing that God, You are here to extend Your help & go through all troubles with us. Help us to like Christ, who gives &amp; not take.To give of our lives to others. To give is more blessed than to receive.  I plead the blood of Jesus over our lives now. Protect us from all the schemes of the devil. We recognise that the devil is at work all the times & we are NOT going to let the devil win in anyway.Help us to be strong &amp; be thankful always.  Thank you Jesus, for You are more than able.You are our help in times of troubles.  In Jesus's NAME,Amen!!!!

       Hi, I'm back. Just visited one website that I think is good for people who are skeptical about Christianity &amp; very helpful for all Christians who want to know more. I personally believe &amp; sense that it has no contradictions from the Words of God. If anyone think so, do contact me asap. :)     &nbsp;   urlLink  http://soulsingerinluv.blogpsot.com/      &nbsp;    okok, talk about Sat.... last Sat (17 July) was a veri busy &amp; rushed day!!!    Firstly, I woke up at 10am &amp; went out to buy tuna, cheese &amp; lunch for Jeff &amp; myself. Tuna &amp; cheese are for making sandwiches for friends&nbsp;at Sentosa! I am joining them in&nbsp;the noon. But too bad, Meifeng&nbsp;suggested that I do not need to do that as they are full. So in the end, sad&nbsp;'cos&nbsp;my&nbsp;specially bought tuna &amp; cheese cant&nbsp;be put to good use. heh heh...     &nbsp;   Many of them went off already by the time Chi Keung &amp; myself went there. So in the end, there were only Meifeng, Carol,&nbsp;Kam Ching plus&nbsp;CK &amp; myself.&nbsp;There was beach volleyball competiton that day &amp; the whole sunset&nbsp;bay was packed with people. I saw&nbsp;"Shen qin san" there too.     &nbsp;   Nothing to do, I decided to kayat. Wow... it was a great first time experience.&nbsp;CK &amp; myself have some coordination problem though.... haha....&nbsp;     &nbsp;   After kayating, I decided to do the one thing I have&nbsp;wished to do for a long time.&nbsp;That was to paint the scenery. Yup!!! I finally brought my paints &amp; brush&nbsp;with me this time round!!! hahaha.... will post up the pic if able to scan nicely. :) But due to&nbsp;a short of equipments like palette, artboard/chipboard&nbsp; etc...&nbsp;I cant expressed my painting 100%... so it&nbsp;could have been better.:p &nbsp;   &nbsp;    urlLink    Okay, after that, in my veri veri causal attire (shorts &amp; slippers), KC, CK &amp; myself went to town to walk walk shop shop... Wow, really, saw many people looking at me.... haha..... don't care. :p      &nbsp;   Finally, went to watch midnight show "brotherhood" with a friend. Wow.... it was great!!!!!!    I give it a 5 stars show. It is highly recommended &amp; a must see for me. :)     &nbsp;   It illustrates the very real scenes of wars. Many scenes, I was scared to death. i finally came to realise the ultimate cruelty of wars. I really pray that&nbsp;there will be no wars.... even&nbsp;though it is not possible to be war free in this end times. &nbsp;     &nbsp;   Many times, I was touched too... &amp; at the last few scenes... i teared. I really think that the script writer has made this story very beautiful. The real brotherhood.     &nbsp;   hahaaa......but it is just my opinion.... some peope may not like it.... but u ask me... i would 100% recommend it. :)     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      Leaving The City of Regret    I had not really planned on taking a trip this time of year, and yet I found myself packing rather hurriedly. This trip was going to be unpleasant and I knew in advance that no real good would come of it. I'm talking about my annual "Guilt Trip."  I got tickets to fly there on Wish I Had airlines. It was an extremely short flight. I got my baggage, which I could not check. I chose to carry it myself all the way. It was weighted down with a thousand memories of what might have been. No one greeted me as I entered the terminal to the Regret City International Airport. I say international because people from all over the world come to this dismal town.  As I checked into the Last Resort Hotel, I noticed that they would be hosting the year's most important event, the Annual Pity Party. I wasn't going to miss that great social occasion. Many of the towns leading citizens would be there.  First, there would be the Done family, you know, Should Have, Would Have and Could Have. Then came the I Had family. You probably know ol' Wish and his clan. Of course, the Opportunities would be present, Missed and Lost. The biggest family would be the Yesterdays. There are far too many of them to count, but each one would have a very sad story to share.  Then Shattered Dreams would surely make and appearance. And It's Their Fault would regale us with stories (excuses) about how things had failed in his life, and each story would be loudly applauded by Don't Blame Me and I Couldn't Help It.  Well, to make a long story short, I went to this depressing party knowing that there would be no real benefit in doing so. And, as usual, I became very depressed. But as I thought about all of the stories of failures brought back from the past, it occurred to me that all of this trip and subsequent "pity party" could be cancelled by ME! I started to truly realize that I did not have to be there. I didn't have to be depressed. One thing kept going through my mind, I CAN'T CHANGE YESTERDAY, BUT I DO HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE TODAY A WONDERFUL DAY. I can be happy, joyous, fulfilled, encouraged, as well as encouraging. Knowing this, I left the City of Regret immediately and left no forwarding address. Am I sorry for mistakes I've made in the past? YES! But there is no physical way to undo them.   So, if you're planning a trip back to the City of Regret, please cancel all your reservations now. Instead, take a trip to a place called, Starting Again. I liked it so much that I have now taken up permanent residence there. My neighbors, the I Forgive Myselfs and the New Starts are so very helpful. By the way, you don't have to carry around heavy baggage, because the load is lifted from your shoulders upon arrival. God bless you in finding this great town. If you can find it -- it's in your own heart -- please look me up. I live on I Can Do It street.

      Great. Its 12.59am right now & im still not sleeping. Just came home from watching the movie, "windstruck". It is a funny, romantic yet sad story. I like the guy "Jang Hyun" & the gal in the show very much. They are genuine & beautiful creatures of God. :)   In the end, the guy died. It was sad. I was reminded of my mom who left me on 4th Feb this year. I take comfort in knowing that I will meet her again someday..... & I will not be sad. I will tell her all of my happiest moments here on earth. i'm sure she will be eager to hear. :) I teared once again. I have learned that there is a time to be strong, there is a time to weep too. I do not have to "act strong" & control my tear everytime. I can truly be myself. Even when I'm going home on the train, I couldnt care whether anyone notices my tearing. I just be myself.     Dear God, guide me in your path. I commit my plans & life to you. Have your way. I will obey. Thank you Jesus.                                                                      Amen.

         Beautiful story. ......           I was reminded to go to Old folk homes or children homes soon... how can we live a more fulfiling & meaningful lives? I always ask myself. .. doesn't want to live till 40 years old &amp; realise that i havent touch a life, meet a need or make a difference in someone's life.      Live not to regret in the end of it all..... :)     "By focusing on others' needs & met them...      love with not our limited human love, but His."          Hand In Hand    Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. (Matt. 22:37-40)  I signed in at the Hospital Volunteer Office, printed out a current room chart from the computer, and headed for the South Wing to begin my rounds as a "Patient Representative." My job was to visit as many of the patients as I could, and to report any complaints indicating that the quality of care was in any way below the high standards set by the hospital's board of directors.  Like most jobs, sometimes this job could be very interesting and a real blessing, and other times it could be dull and tedious, depending not only on the moods and degree of illness of the patients, but also on my own mood and temperament at the time. On this particular day, I was preoccupied with the fact that my hands were hurting me, due to an ailment known as "trigger finger," which caused my fingers to lock temporarily in a bent position and then suddenly release. This condition had gradually worsened, becoming increasingly painful to the point of requiring surgery, which was scheduled for the following week. Although the operation was a relatively minor one, the pain nevertheless kept it in the forefront of my mind, and my resulting self-centeredness and concern for myself, rather than for the patients, was reflected in their lack of response to me. I just wanted to get through my calls as fast as possible and go home.  There were four names posted outside the door to room #2013, the first of which was John Shannon. The list on my clipboard indicated that he was 67 years old and lived in the neighboring town to mine. He had a hospital bathrobe on over his pajamas, and was seated in a chair with a lunch tray in front of him that had barely been touched, although most of the patients had long since finished their meal. "Hi, my name is Buzz," I announced with a joviality I did not feel. "I see you are eating your lunch, so I will stay only for a moment, but I wanted to find out how you are doing, and to see if there is anything I can do for you." He looked up with a warm smile and said, "Oh, that's all right, Buzz. I'm doing fine, but sit down for a minute, won't you? You see, my wife died last year, and since my daughter works and my son lives off the Cape, I don't have many visitors to talk to." I winced inwardly at the thought that this call was going to take a while, but I sat down on the edge of the bed agreeing "Well, okay; just for a moment."  It was only then that I noticed that he was having difficulty getting the food up to his mouth, and was spilling most of it on the front of his pajamas. Then I saw his hands. All of his fingers were bent grotesquely out of shape in different directions, so that it was all but impossible for him to hold a knife and fork properly. "Would you like me to feed you?" I heard myself offer involuntarily. "I sure would," he responded with a smile. "At this rate, I would starve to death." I pulled up a chair along side of him, cut up his meat into bite size pieces, and fed him like a one-year old. He didn't seem to feel the least bit self-conscious about it, and therefore I didn't either. "What on earth happened?" I asked him directly, and he related that he had woken up one morning six weeks before to find his hands frozen in this position. After a series of tests, the doctors still had no explanation for it. They had hoped that somehow it might correct itself and go away as suddenly as it had appeared, but there had been no change during all that time. They were doing some advanced testing now, using all the most modern equipment available, in an effort to determine the cause of the problem and what to do about it. Because he lived alone, I asked him how he managed at home, and he said that his daughter lived nearby, and came in before going to work in the morning, and again on her way home at night. Also, his son, who was a priest and had a church parish several hours away, came every Saturday to mow the grass and help with whatever needed to be done around the house.  Then he asked me about myself, my family, and how I came to move to Cape Cod; and he was so interested in me and my story, that it was some time before I realized that we were spending more time talking about me, and my kids, and my hands, than we were about him. I turned the conversation back to what he had done before retiring to the Cape, and he told me that he had lived in New Jersey, where he had been a life insurance salesman for many years with one of the large national life insurance companies. He loved selling insurance, because he found that he could help people in an important area of their lives which they were not capable of handling themselves. With that attitude, he became one of their most valued salesmen, and eventually was made an executive officer and director of the company. He was such a warm, gregarious person, that I just naturally liked him, and I could easily understand his success.  Besides all this, however, there was something else about this man that fascinated me. Here he was with a debilitating disability, far more serious than the temporary problem that I had with my hands, and facing the distinct possibility that he might be burdened with it for the rest of his life; and yet he was more positive and outgoing in his attitude, and cheerful in his spirit, than I was. I was convicted of my own self-centeredness and self pity, and particularly of my lack of gratitude for the many blessings that were mine, and that I so easily had come to take for granted.  By the time that I finally got up to leave, a strong bond had formed between us, as though we were old friends, and indeed, I felt that we were just that. He thanked me profusely for what I had done for him, and, with tears in his eyes, repeated several times how much my caring had meant to him. There were also tears in my eyes, as I told him honestly that he had helped me, too. Before I left, I took his gnarled hands in my own and said, "I'll pray for those hands," and I heard him answer softly, "And I for yours. God bless you, Buzz." --- Word: I have commanded you to love me with all your heart, and all your soul, and all your mind, and to love your neighbor as you have loved yourself. How are you to do this, since it is your human nature and your life's pattern to love yourself instead of others? Ah, child, the love that I am requiring of you is not your natural human love, because that is divided at best, and as changeable as the wind. I am requiring you to love me with the same love with which I love you, which is a superhuman love, a divine love, a love that is total and inalterable. How can that be? My love for you, my son, is far beyond your understanding, and you cannot even begin to imagine the extent of it. Consider the universe and the billions of stars that it encompasses. With your radio telescopes, you can probe its closer part, and you can measure in light years the distance to its nearby stars, but my love for you is so great that no measure exists that can describe the smallest part of it. Consider the sea. You can travel its length and breadth, and fathom its depths. You can even chart accurately every inch if it, but you cannot fathom my love, for there is no end to its depth.  And yet, in a way that is beyond your knowing, my love must be returned to me to be complete, and for this I am dependent upon you. Receive my love, child, of which there is no other that is true, and in receiving it, you, like a mirror, will reflect it back to me, and to your neighbor, also. Thereby, there shall flow through you an outpouring of love which you can neither understand nor contain, leaving no shred of self love behind.
