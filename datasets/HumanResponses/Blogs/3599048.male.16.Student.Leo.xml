      Ugh there's this problem that has been bothering me for a couple of days...about a week ago something happened to my friend and she had to go to the doctor, well two particular people whom shall remain un-named due to the dramatics that would follow if their names were released...any ways these two people started spreading these rumors about my friend, well not long the WHOLE school had heard what was wrong...now the problem is, they don't ever talk to my friend and they don't need to be in her business if she wanted EVERYBODY AND THEIR MOM TO KNOW SHE WOULD'VE TOLD THEM HERSELF! God people are so narrow minded its so aggravating. Ciao

      Ok today has been going good...I have a tennis tournament in Pasadena this weekend...hopefully I'll do better than last time because the last match I played in, the word terrible doesn't even come close to describe how I did...Oh and an add on to my previous entry...If I'm sooo stupid how hell did I get an A in math (because the calling me stupid was referencing back to math class) and on the last test how come I got the highest grade...I mean I'm supposed to be SO dumb! Ok no more talking about that crap...so far spring break has been good, nothing but relaxing...tis grand! Well got to go and make plans to practice before the tournament... Ciao
