       Woop woop woop woop woop. Boo-Ya and any other war cries i can add on top that shit. at exactly 10:38 PM i printed out my ex2 pseudo master piece ( Breathes heavily) it was actually quite cool to see something i had put...well...some work into spit out the printer...all 7893words of it....YAY!! Now the only barrier is that bastardly reflection statement 1500 words that are just as bloody important than the actual story....razzel fazzel( said in gruff cartoon-like tone) . i have to sort of make my diary look more impressive too, but hey i'm satisfied for now. I put a couple of last minute twists in so that was cool. I decided like an hour ago to include a short chapter about my characters daughter to show the impact of his story on her...reveling the psychological cycle of parent-child etc. anyways enuf smarts for one day. Shaun turn dumb-dumb now.... ( Shaun begins to jump up and down dancing retardly to new theme song) Adapted from happy 2b hardcore ch7 final mix "Just Accept it"  Just accept it, Just accept it, ........., Why 'o why can't you just accept it, I'm a creep not a crazy ass fagat, Yeah thas right i stalk at nite i really like it, Leave me alone it's my life i'm gonna do it.

                    Ahhh another day.....with an extremely disturbing close. As always it begins with legal.....some believe it all starts with the dream...some that gatsby is the driving force behind such gruesome events....i believe it just has something to do with our legal class and the idiots, i.e me, in said class.                Anywho i feel some guilt in reportibng this....ahh what the hell if anything fronttline has taught us its fun to entertain people at the expense of others dignity....Petros and Rubi today well...if u don know i'm not gonna tell u...so there. Anyway the scholar and i were wallowing in self pity...well at least i was...sob...after receiving our legal results...DAMN U HADDAD DAMN U TO HELL!!! (SHAKES FIST VIOLENTLY) (HITS HAND ON COMPUTER)...OW!!!                ???? Okay that was uncalled for neways we spyed the two in question holding hands etc...and began our own lil conspiracy theory...after the periods end we stalked our prey for the interrogation...well it wasn't much of a stalk more of a walk...and they didn'ty exactly move....well...neways. After some questioning regarding the holding and the closeness and the "wah-hey wah-hi" (Professor Frink) Petros commeneted with...from out of nowhere i do assure thee....that " We were just disscussing our  sexual endeavours"  i think i speak for everyone when i say -WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT!!!? WHAT THE SHIT  IS THE MATTER WITH........( shaun rants on for ...well...a while) i think i shall leave it at that...for judgement is reserved for god and god alone...god i don't envy him having to deal with such matters....

But it must be asked when does sibling rivalry come into play....i'll tell u when...when this sort of stuff begins to occur  "  Alas, tis the hour betwixt Midnight and 10...it's 11. i must prepare for my shapeshifting duties...so i will leave nw...I must sleep in order to effectively stalk 2night"- Scholar                  As all loyal creeps must know the night is our time our sacred time in which we commit acts of creepy and idiotic proportions....it is the time that all scholars must utilise to study like good little drones with the thick horn rimmed glasses etc.                And so though i am sorry to do so war must be declared as loyal creeps of the dominion of creepidom i ask you to join me in scared battle- what we creeps call Cree-had - and help me - through idiotic one liners such as that to quash our scholar bretheren so that we may take out rightful place as rulers of the galaxy i mean...uh...the blog...the galaxy comes later mwahahaha.               To begin our creepy campaign i bring forth new allies to help me out as harbingers of scholarly defeat yes ladies and gentleman we now have official sponsers- Cr-ike, a subtle subdivision of the better known Nike.

                     Creep very happy today, trials are over, my mates have all been in the same vicinity outside of a bloody exam time for the first time in two bloody weeks...how good it is to be bak                Newho scholar girl has given me advice on some budding new clientele so i decided it may just help if u actually got the whole creep thing.....jus maybe...                It all started once upon a time in our meagre Legal Studies class. Devoid of friends within the class following the departure of Krish and left with the prospect of DJ AJ( Sherman)...a fate worse than death...i resorted to a still low but more fanciful denominater...The Scholar Girl (Christine)...relax chriz  just joking...or m i??? Neways bak to me i began my bludgeing career in legal with scholar and co.... they were a bad influence on me i did more work in a month than i have in the terms i have been with them...tsk tsk.                 Scholar and i began to attack maggie and Antoinette out of boredom. Maggie retaliated quite viciously promising...nay threatening...to dump me in a ditch and leaving me there to rot...hence ditch girl was born.                 Allowing Ditch girl time to cool off we concentrated on taking the shit out of Antoinette...it was too easy so it was quite boring... Antoinette managed to amaze us all with prize winning bullshit and conspiracy theories including accussing my and scholars teasing as a sinister plot to see her slip in the rankings....hmmm would we do that???....well mayb Scholar but not me.....                  Finally The genesis of a legend...the Creep-man... At times Scholar and ditch would  attempt  to provoke me only to find out it was impossible. Even i could tease the shit out of me better than they were...amateurs...see i have no sense of shame....that way all my other senses are enhanced. I made it my mission then to disrupt the otherwise boring lives of these three poor souls sneak attacks dissapearing pens and relentless comebacks all took their toll and so scholar coined the name creep for me due to my aptitude in...well...creeping her and the rest of our troupe out....                                          The beginning of an urban legend,                                                                                   Shaun Farlow -  Creep Extraordinaire

                   I Haven't bothered to post in a while and i was thiniking what to do...i'll keep the metaphorical shit to myself but i decide for future reference i would explain the traits behind the titles i give....            The Scholar:  The scholar is an academically minded smart arse to put it quite simply...this kind of person is always a conscientious worker and has all the answers whether or not they choose to reveal them. The scholar is an extremely annoying person for the most part even with there mere present the fact that u know they got all the answers does shit the everyday creep....             The Ditch Person :  You don't wanna mess with this person....seriously...full creepy alert here.  A lot of guys i talk to rate being in the doghouse as a bad thing...its not ...its actually quite nice compared to my current accomodation. I managed through my creepy charm to end up in a hole in the ground i no longer have a roof over head and if not for the marvel of batteries i wouldn't be able to type this warning...beware the wrath of the Ditch master.....             Conspirators:  Need i say more this person can be nearly as cumbersome to the gentleman creep than the scholar...only just. this person has the annoying quality of jumping to increasingly more ridiculus conclusions. Examples include famous people that have died and which persons are going out all the while displaying a world is out to get me attitude. The one most important quality to any conspirator however...they are NEVER right and if they were to be the world just may end....              More Creepy Terminology coming soon.....while your sleeping

                Ahhh The NRL sport of kings and much revere of your run-of-the-mill Qld or NSW Bogan but is it really desrving of such a following...there are many elements making this support quite dubious.          For Starters the nature of the game itself a bunch of oversised illeterate mooks (Tallis) groping each other whilst sweating profuself - considering the major following of the game is male i think our nation is hiding in the closet en masse. particularly seeing the game demands players don tight shorts- think about it.           Then you've got the ambassador of the game, Reg Reagan, i got nothing against old reggie hes a big, creepy kind of guy - i like that. Considering the guy is a beer-bellied oversised over aggressive  Fictional   character  and the guy has a hit single - about the man on man action we experience every winter weekend - sydney i think we have a problem.           On a final note the game itself i mean why do they call it a try when the guy just succeeded?? by the same token a point in soccer would be called a kick but hey i guess they had to dumb it down for the overage kiddies * cough* Tallis *cough*. i mean they spent 5 minutes last week explaining the rule to the guy when he makes a career out of the game.                                                               Till Next time Creep Sympathisers,                                                                                                                       Shaunsy

                 I was once told that everything we do should end in hope....hope for the future...hope for our loved ones....hope we have a good time tommorrow night at the bar...           Though i thought i did i never really got that notion. I just lived with  my head held high and my mind in the gutter i didn't care what others around me thought so long as i could have fun with those im lucky enough to consider friends.             When i'm not with my friends i can't help but think, with what little brains i have, how i feel and what matters to me...who matters to me. I never believed that hope was so impotant to me... just messing around.              I watched the butterfly effect recently, top movie, and, working at a video store, i'd seen dealer previews etc. I was dissapointed to find the retail copy had a different version with a different ending. Sounds trivial enough  but in the retail ending he uses his power to erase his existence. This destroyed the whole movie fir me. The point is i wanted that hope to be there that despited trial and tribulation that hope can exist.             I've never understood suicide to killl yourself when things get tough is just cowardly, your shying away from challenge and what little time we have is a testimony to those before us to kill ourselves is to disgrace their memory and it only creates more pain for those left.              The point is, as human beings, we have to grasp that hope when things seem tough we have to cling to that and cling to the hope of others, help each other acheive our dreams. When things seem closest cling to hope...Hope will endure....

                    heres something i decide to post once in a while for no better reason than...i have nothing better to do so without further ado this edition brings you the lighter side of....techno music.               Ahhh techno music also known as inbreeder music amongst certain circles of friends, though i quite like it....don't read too much into that. Anyways as is well known guys-with-no-nuts high pitch singing can get hard to understand at times...with funny results.               One of my current favs is 'Don't cry for me' on Happy 2b Hardcore chapter 7 mix for those of you taking notes...anyway the chorus is 'Don't cry for me, when your nights are cold and lonely'. My little bro misinterpreted and has been singing for the past few days and blamed me that my techno was getting him weird looks at school- not surprising seeing he was singing wait for it:                            " Don't cry for me, when your  nuts  are cold and lonely"                     Till next Time peeps,                                                        Shaunsy

                    Have you ever suffered from silence?? sat still enough till the sheer emptiness of the space around you and the lack of sound begins to gnaw against your skull?? The ordeal many just like me face now is too suffer such agony. To exist for 3 hours almost everyday in a world where the incessant scratching of pen against paper becomes your only melody.               Why do we endure this?? Because we have no choice... because we are so driven or competetive that all that is essential to our meagre existence is to see the results of our time in that drearisome world escalate? Are we so petty that these numbers will shape and define us? If so what after? What will there be for us but emptiness to have given so much of ourselves to something so fleeting as a number?              All I know is this, come what may all of us at one time must endure this silence. Its what this silence does to us that will define this all i remeber every time i free myself from that world is the vouce in my head whispering  I won't back down  when the silence becomes most unbearable let that be your melody .. never surrendur to failure but strive to do your best and come out of that world prepared to live...                                            Good Luck to all who must endure...                                                                                                   Shaunsy

Believe me i can do worse is it any surprise the legacy began in legal studies perhaps not.                  Well, like it or not, the creep now is with blog and can creep you all out without having to be in close proximity ( see i told you i got worse...i'm so bloody bored). Anyways you can expect me to reveal my creepiness in its entirety with future posts so if your still reading your probably a mate of mine having a good laugh at my expense...either that or you accidently came here trying to reach a friends site...try again mate.                  For now however it is done and you all shall now be inflicted with my wrath (insert maniacal laugh here)                                   Thank you come again....
