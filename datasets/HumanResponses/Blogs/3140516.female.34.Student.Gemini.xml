      Okay, I know that there are people out there with all kinds of questions about how or why someone could go from being a sweet, pious Catholic school girl to being a bisexual pagan involved in the fight to allow same sex marriages, but the phone call I just got was really odd. A very good friend of mine from my school days apparently gave my phone number to another girl I was friends with WAY back then, and told her to check out my website, expressed the need to have an open mind, people change, but sometimes it is for the better, yadda yadda, blah blah blah.Well, I just sat through a ten minute tirade against me for my beliefs and my sexuality and how I am abhorent to God and my children will be damned by the actions of their mother. When she finally stopped to take a breath, I asked her what it is about me now that disturbs her so much, and her response(after a short silence) was that I am far too open about it, and that I should be respectful of other people and not put them on the spot like that. Not having any freaking idea what she was talking about, I asked her to clarify, and she broke down in tears and sobbingly admitted to me that since we were in the sixth grade, she has known she is a lesbian, and that she has been a closet pagan for almost as long! Wow, two closets she has kept the doors shut to for all this time. The kicker is that she is my age (34) and she is afraid to tell anyone in her family because she is afraid her mom will freak out(understandable) and(here is the amusing part) not allow her to date anyone. SHE IS 34 YEARS OLD! I mean I know her mother is a dominating bitch(that's nothing new), but that just boggles the mind, ya know? Wow, what a way to start the day! Oh, the end of this story is that she told me if I were to ever move back to the town that I grew up in, she would like to get together and see what happens...

      that you think they are lying about their beliefs because they think it is trendy or cool? I mean, if they are not even willing to put in the effort to do research on the things they are saying, and are obviously picking up information from really bad movies, and taking that as being the truth because it was on the big screen in glorious technicolor... That is the problem with some people nowadays. They take everything at face value, and glom onto someone else's opinion, rather than finding out the realities and forming their own. I have been Pagan for a long time, and it was not because I felt like freaking people out or wanting people to judge me because of those beliefs. My beliefs ring true to ME. I don't follow someone else blindly down a path and say this is the way everyone has to think. And I am sick to death of being asked the inane questions that I get repeatedly bombarded with, questions based on silly Hollywood fantasies about magic and pagans. For crying out loud, people, if you want to ask me a question, then do yourself and me a favor...research the information you are looking for FIRST. Then ask for my views. Otherwise, you may get a rather nasty response from me. Hooray for Hollywood? Not hardly...

      then don't bother reading my blog, because I am pretty sure you won't understand the thoughts and information that I put down in this place. Closed-minded individuals never do.

      It has been a hellish week once again. I really wish people would give me a chance to breathe before they start the same old cycles of bullshit that they keep pulling me into.Or that they would decide to keep their stupid mouths shut when they really have nothing to say or have no idea what the real situation is. One piece of good news, my husband is going to be making more money and spending more time at home. That makes me very happy. Be back soon, making dinner and writing in my blog are not going hand in hand as well as I had hoped.

      Wow! Today is absolutely beautiful out. You can finally tell spring is here, because it is not dropping below 40 at night, and they are no longer predicting snow in our forecast. In case people couldn't figure it out, I have been in a bad mood lately. Not a typical bad mood, mind you, but what I call black depression. When I am in one of those moods, all I want to do is cry. Everything looks and feels hopeless, and I stand at the edge of an ever-deepening abyss in my mind, not knowing if I am going to fall in. Everything overwhelmes me, and nothing overwhelmes me(i mean, in the sense that nothing can happen, and I am still overwhelmed). Fortunately I have a couple of people that I can talk to when that happens, besides my husband. The two of them know who they are, so I will not embarrass them by putting their names on here. Suffice it to say, one is my sissy, and one is a dear friend. Unfortunately, talking does not always help. But I do feel much better today than I have in a long time, even though I had a troubled sleep and really don't feel rested. Ah, well. Life goes on...

      It is way too early for me to be up. Got nowhere near the sleep that I was hoping for, mainly because a friend talked me into helping her fill out information for online lesbian dating services. Because she can't describe herself. She seemed to do just fine without me before, because I know she has posted them before, but she apparently is sick of the kind of women she gets responses from. So I found her a totally free service that sends her her matches via email, and all she has to do is peruse them at her leisure. Now, I do not have a problem with helping someone out like this. I know what it is like to be sad and alone. I just don't care too much for the part where I get MY head bit off because she is tired of getting screwed over. My husband actually has the day off today.(Will wonders never cease?) So we are actually going to attempt to hang out as a family tonight with the kids. We'll see how that goes. I won't be too surprised if all hell breaks loose because so and so looks cross-eyed at his sister or something like that.That's what usually happens, maybe this time we will get lucky. I mean, I already consider myself lucky. Two divorces from very Christian(no offense to Christians, don't want anyone to think I am knocking anyone else's religion) men, and I still managed to come out on the better end of deal, full custody of the two oldest, and split custody of my five year old, and of course, my husband and I have the baby. (Okay, so he is not really a baby anymore, he is going to be two.) Several dear friends of mine don't even have the privilege of having custody of their kids, and they do deserve it. None of us is a perfect parent in this world, but dammit, they loved those kids, and they were making the  effort . I know a lot of people who don't. Well, time to go get another cup of coffee, I will be right back. Ahhhhh. Chocolate Velvet coffee.SOOOOOOOOO GOOD. Two of my addictions, taken care of in one shot.  Now I know what you are thinking. You are saying, Shan, why don't you go back to bed, now that the little darlings are all off to school, instead of sitting in front of the computer, drinking coffee, and trying to wake up, you poor dear? The answer is because I am a pushover. Now before you start thinking I have COMPLETELY cracked, let me explain. My friend T(the lesbian, whose name I am shortening on here only because she is aware of this blog, and I don't want her getting mad that I put her name on here for everyone to see), is asleep in my livingroom, and needs to be up at 9:15 to get ready for work. If I go back to bed, I will not wake up in time to wake her up, and she will be late, and the economy will collapse. Okay maybe not the last part, but she would be in a lot of trouble and I don't want that to happen. She just signed a lease on an apartment, and I would like her to be able to keep said apartment, because she is NOT moving back in here. Done that already, not going there again. Love her to death, cannot live with her. It is extremely difficult for me to deal with having her here as often as she is, which is pretty much still all the time. Here's the reason: my car went kaput. No idea what is wrong with it, need to get it fixed, don't have the money right now, don't know when I am gonna have the money. She was paying me gas money when she could, or when she remembered, or when I asked her outright for it, depending on the point of view and what day it was, in order for me to run her to and from work, which I did not have a problem with. When it is running, I am in my car more often than I am out of it anyway, so it is no big deal. Anyway, car goes kaput. Great. She lives on the same side of town that I do, but about 21 blocks away, with a major interstate exit between. She does not want to walk that far to work every morning. Now here is the part that I don't get, and I do not want to even broach this subject with her, because well, frankly, she has a bit of a temper(like me) and I am not going to deal with that. The place where she works is about ten blocks from a particular intersection. Okay..ten blocks, no biggie. My place is about seven blocks to the north of the same intersection. Now, she can walk from her place to mine, with a minimum of bitching about the walk, but she cannot walk from her place to work..because it is too far.  HELLO!  It is  three  more blocks! My sister said to tell her to take her ass home, and walk to work, because if she can make it to my place, she sure as shit can make it to work, but like I said, I do not need the hassle. I don't like fighting with people, and that is exactly what would happen. Like I said, I love her to death, but oh man...I think part of the problem is that she and I are a lot alike. We have both been through a lot of shit in our lives, and I don't know what I would have done if someone had not helped me out when I was her age. Anyway, she is going home tonight, after work, and staying there until at least tomorrow, so that is a good thing. I need time for my family and I, not my family and I and anyone else. I just hope she finds a girlfriend with a car that is willing to drive her to work soon! I am trying to break several habits all at once and I think the stress is contributing to my being loopy and tired. I am trying to quit smoking(the biggest and worst of my vices), trying to quit biting my nails(because they look like crap and for once in my life, I want pretty hands), and I am on a diet. Or should I say, I am continuing to be on a diet, because I have been on a diet for so long, that I will die while on it. I have to keep making changes to my eating habits, though, so that is why I am continuously on a diet. I have a medical condition(which I am not going to go into this morning) which requires me to regulate my eating, which is a HUGE pain in the ass, but I do it because I would like to live to see any grandkids I might have in twenty years. Anyway, now that the weather has FINALLY warmed up here, I am going to be outside in the fresh air getting more exercise, as well as starting a new toning program, so hopefully, I will burn the calories at an even faster rate, and get skinny quicker.Okay not skinny,because for me that is impossible. I despise toothpick people in the first place, and I do not wish to be one. Slimmer is the word I was looking for.  Well, I am going to get one more cup of coffee and a cigarette before I have to wake up T., so again, I will be right back. I have a pin my oldest son gave me that says, "I'd love to help, but I have misplaced my wand." I think that is what I am going to start telling people. I am tired of being the miracle worker, the one who saves everyone from themselves and their bullshit they have somehow managed to get themselves tangled up in.

      Okay, I am back with yet another rant...some people have told me that they are amused by some of the things I said earlier, which is fine.Just don't bitch when something I say pisses you off! My new rant concerns users. People who you try to be nice to, for whatever reason, and they take the concern and care you show them and use that as a means to get into your life and then act all pissy when you ask them to give you a break from them. Take my friend Jessie. Very sweet girl, but OH MY GODDESS. She is one of those people that acts all sweet and nice to you, but as soon as you are nice back, she turns into Demon Jessie. I have done some wonderful things for her, bent over backwards to make sure that she is taken care of, is not wanting for anything, etc(not to toot my own horn, but ask anyone i am friends with-I will do anything for someone I consider a friend, even going so far as to open my home up on a few occasions for people who not only took advantage of that, but then stabbed me in the back afterwards), and you would think that she would have the decency to treat me and my family with respect, right? WRONG! She just keeps taking full advantage of us, and when I have tried to talk to her about her lack of respect, holy hades breaks loose. She acts like I accused her of murder. I am getting really close to beating the crap out of her one of these days, I swear...

      And here's another thing that pisses me off...people who get mad because you have removed them from a friends' list...are you really that hard up for friends you have to get mad at someone you only know online, because they felt it was necessary to delete you because you and they never talk any more? If you are that desperate for friends, go out and get a life away from the computer. Talk to some real people, not just screen names in a chatroom or on a list. Find a hobby, get involved in a class, fall in love, fall out of love, whatever... AND SPEAKING OF LOVE: It is IMPOSSIBLE to fall in love with and get married to someone online that you have never met in real life. That is another thing I am tired of: Online weddings and handfastings. Do you know how demeaning that idea is to people involved in real life relationships? Especially when a supposedly Pagan couple has an online handfasting when they have never even met in real life. HELLO... A handfasting is meant to PHYSICALLY BIND THE HANDS TOGETHER, symbolizing the unbreakable bond you have with that person. It is not possible to physically bind someone to another over a computer. All that is is really bad playacting, and even worse, it is nothing but words. How can you promise to be faithful to someone you have never met, and who you wouldn't be the slightest bit interested in even if you did actually meet them in real life? Are we suddenly in the middle ages again, when families promised to marry their unborn children to other unborn children, and then actually followed through on it? When the fuck did this happen? And how? I must have missed the big reversal of time that transported us back through the centuries.  Get a life, people! If you want to get to know someone, take the time to talk to them about mundane things, and then actually MEET them. Get to know them, really know them. Not just through a computer screen. One of the best people I have ever met, I actually took the time to meet in person. She is wonderful, and I would do anything for her that it is within my power to do, I care that much about her. I wish she and I had both not been so fucked up at the time we met, because I think I will have feelings for her for the rest of my life, but that all got screwed up through each of our problems, and the addition of a third party. Anyway, she and I did not work, no matter how much I wanted us to, and out of resentment and pain, I lashed out at her. I wish I could take the things back and make it so they had never happened, but I can't. All we can do is move on. And we have. We recently started talking again, and even if friendship is all we are supposed to achieve in this life with each other, it is fine. Because I know her as a person. Not as some faceless voice on the computer. I made the effort. Now, if those of you out there who think you are so "in love" with the person you think you have made a connection with can't make the effort to actually meet the other person, in a safe way(like telling friends and family about them, and meeting in a public place), then how much in love can you possibly be?

      Have you ever noticed that as soon as someone suspects there is something wrong with you, if you do not want to talk about it, they automatically assume that they did something to piss you off? I have yet to meet the person that has that much control over my life that I refuse to talk to anyone else just because I am mad at them. Or, the other side of the coin, someone who assumes that even though you snarl at them, they insist that you HAVE to tell them all about what is wrong, because they want to help/listen. At least I have the decency to ASK first if they would like to talk before I get pushy, LOL! Look people, if I do not want to talk, and I tell you that, that does not mean that you need to start sending me a fuckload of emotes, with hugs and kisses and frowning faces or tears, or that you need to tell me, well, I am always here to listen if you need me. First off, to me, emotes are just like real signs of affection, friendship, etc. I do not hug and kiss every person that I know, just the ones that are special to me, and they know who they are. They are the ones I want to be sending hugs and kisses to, NOT the general public. Secondly, I find it supremely insulting when someone who only knows me as a name on a computer screen, who knows nothing at all about me IRL, starts to "cry" through emotes because I tell them I am upset. It's like mocking someone, or showing fake sympathy. STOP THAT! You don't care enough about me on a daily basis to find out anything about me irl, don't pretend that you care that I am upset. Thirdly, if I needed just   anyone   to listen to my problem or whatever it is that is upsetting me, I would go into chat and broadcast it in there. There is a reason I do not do that. Because only certain people need to know every little thing that is going on in my life, and those people are the ones I seek out to talk to. I swear, one of these days, I am gonna start autoigging everyone that does these things to me, so I don't have to deal with them anymore... Enough for now, I have some work I need to do on my website and on a few other things... TTYL

      This is my first post, first blog, first time I have actually sat down and thought about the random thoughts that race around inside my head, and I have no idea how this is going to turn out. It is possible that none of this will make any sense to anyone, except me, and that's fine with me. As much as I hope that something I might say will make you think or entertain you, that is not the real purpose of this. This is so I can maybe figure out some of the things that keep me awake at night...

      Sorry it has been awhile, but I have had a lot going on. I had a telephone interview yesterday with an Admissions Representative from Brown College, because I am trying to get into Culinary School. She told me she is going to recommend me for admission! I am SOOOOOOOOO excited. This will require me and my family to move down to the Twin Cities area, but that is okay, because i will be closer to my little sister, and I think she needs someone closer to her geographically. It is not easy to get into Brown College, you need to be recommended for admission, and that is why I am so happy and excited. You see, I LOVE to cook. It is one of my passions. I am happiest when I am building a menu and shopping for ingredients, then creating the whole meal with my hands and my heart. I just have to hope that my financial aid comes through and that I will be able to afford to go. ................ My little sister has started a blog. I am so proud of her. I know it seems silly to be proud of someone for doing one of these, but I really am. She buries emotions and feelings and pain and guilt and all the things that could trip her up when she is feeling strongly about something, and I think the blog is going to help her begin to express herself much more strongly. --------------- I am feeling really off today. Not off like mentally, but just very tired and sluggish. I hate feeling like this. I know it is from lack of sleep, but still...I feel like crawling back into bed and hiding under the covers. Unfortunately I cannot do that. I have things to do, places to go, people to see, bills to pay, yadda yadda yadda. I am going to go make a pot of coffee and will be right back...don't go anywhere...I am waiting for a phone call from the Head of the Culinary School, because I have to have a mini-interview with him as well, just to go over things. Then I have to go do laundry and some other stuff. Never enough time in the day for everything I need time to do....

      Okay..I am now back....it is my second son's 6th birthday today, and I am making tacos for dinner, and then we are having birthday cake, and then we are going to his t-ball game, then I get to come home and call my ex-father in law(the father of the ex I ranted about earlier....)because the older two kids' grandma died this afternoon. I am going to try to figure out how to go about getting down there for the funeral with the kids...

          OH MY GODDESS!     I have had a totally draining week! First off, I am still continuing my search for a place to live in the Cities when I go to school. I am being very picky about this, because, well, I want to be, quite frankly. I have always been relatively docile about these things, and for some reason this time, I simply don't want to be...I want to be as truly happy in where I live as I am in the direction my life is going, as truly happy as I am with my darling and dammit, I am not going to settle. So, all this pickiness is leading to a LOT of travel time, stuck in a car for hours reaching one destination, then stuck in a car again, looking for something else, then coming all the way back home. I despise having to drive for hours as it is....I prefer to drive because I WANT to, not because I HAVE to...however, I have found a place that I think may be perfect...antique maple woodwork, stained glass windows, absolutely beautiful...going to check with the owner next week... Anyway, I also found a lovely brownstone, and I am also supposed to go back there next week..I had made all the plans for travelling and everything the other night, and said goodnight to my friend and travelling companion(I cannot drive long distances alone, because of my condition), and planned to just kick back. However... I had been having a bad feeling all day, and just couldn't shake it. I knew something was wrong with someone I love, and I couldn't put my finger on it...went to make a sandwich, and suddenly it hit me that I needed to check my cell for a message from my kids, because I had not heard from them in a couple days, and I worry about them when they are in Iowa with their dad. I went to pick up the phone,(mind you, it had not rang), and suddenly I was listening to my daughter sobbing on the other end, begging me to come get her and her brother. I got her calmed down enough to tell me what was wrong, and finally, she spilled out the whole story: Her dad and stepmom had been fighting, screaming at each other ever since the kids had gotten there, and it had finally come to a head; my ex husband was watching a movie in the living room, and his wife was screaming at him to turn it down, he stepped outside for a minute, and she followed him out there and pulled her fist back and belted him one. He had gone back in the house and she got back in his face and he had shoved her, and she ran to the phone in their room and called the cops to have him arrested, telling them that he had cornered her in her bedroom and he was going to shoot her. The cops showed up, saw the mark on his face, saw the marks on her, and arrested BOTH OF THEM for domestic violence against each other...AND ALL THIS HAPPENED IN FRONT OF MY CHILDREN! Now, what would you do? I have physical custody of my children, and he has visitation rights. As far as I am concerned, since he was drunk and making threats(okay, he couldn't have shot her...his guns are at his parents' house and they are locked up and he does not have the key-because he is a drunk and stupid), that shows a lack of responsibility on his part. I did not know the people who my children were about to be sent to spend time with while daddy dearest and the bitch he is married to cooled their heels in jail. So i did the first thing my instincts told me to do: I called my best friend and little brother and asked the two of them to accompany me to get my children. After we got home, I called my attorney(wonderful woman) and told her what had transpired, and she said if he is really dumb enough to go into court and try to charge me with violating his visitation rights, in which case, the court would be told what had transpired that night, and chances that any court in the country would fault me for my actions are slim and none. I was acting in a reasonable manner to protect my children in that I removed them from a house where domestic violence and threats of deadly harm were occurring. I have no doubt in my mind that if my ex had had access to his guns, that that one punch from his wife would have been enough prompting for him to put a bullet in her brain pan. I will not allow my children to be in that type of environment. I left him because of that behavior, and he lied and told me that he was no longer getting drunk and that he was no longer violent. He then whined to me on the phone, and I told him that I think he and his wife both need anger management and therapy to deal with their anger issues and the obvious trouble their marriage is in, or else they need to get the fuck away from each other and stay that way. The only reason I have allowed the children to visit him without reservation until now is that I believed he was being honest with me, and nothing like this had happened before. Now that it has, it will be a cold day in hell before he has unsupervised visitation with the children again. If he wants to see them, he is gonna have to drag his ass up here and see them. He went and pissed off the one person he does not want mad at him again. Stupid fucker. So, anyway, now all my babies are home with me, where they belong, where they are safe and loved and above all, HAPPY.

      Wow...it has been forever since I have been here. I was accepted into Brown College in Minnesota, to the Culinary Arts school, and I have been SO damn busy I have barely had time to think, let alone visiting my blog. It's been over a month.  AND...today is my birthday. Yep...I am 34 years old. Today I feel so much older than that.I am so tired today, and just not feeling well. And tonight my little brother and one of my little sisters is taking me out for drinks. Plus I am helping another brother move. Plus there is T-Ball for my almost six year old, and a bunch of other stuff I have to do today....and none of it involves sleeping in, goddess damn it. I should have told everyone to screw themselves, I was gonna spend all day in bed, but I really can't do that, not if I want little brother off my freaking couch and my son to not be crying all night. Have you ever missed someone so badly that it makes you hurt? I mean really, physically hurt? There is someone I miss so badly that it feels like an icepick has been driven through me...I wish I could just call and say, I need to see you, and go there and be okay, not scared of the future, not feeling lonesome for their company. Just BE THERE with them, ya know? Maybe you don't. Maybe I have finally snapped. Maybe old age is catching up with me, because I sure feel a lot older than 34 today...

         well, it has been a couple days, and I am surprised that I have not been here sooner than this, but I have been mega busy and stuff, so, yeah...       Got to talk to my girl last night. She is such a tease!(By my girl, I am not referring to my daughter). She has been going through a lot, and I am glad she decided to call me and let me know what was happening. Before the phone call ended, we were laughing hysterically because I misheard something she said. I think her&nbsp; man thinks we are insane, lol...if you are reading this hun..ROWWWWRRRR!lol!       Got the apartment we wanted so badly in Burnsville, I am SO happy! This place is freaking awesome, and I know we are going to be VERY happy living there. Got the Uhaul all arranged and everything, so that will not be a problem , and told the manager that we will be up there next week to sign the paperwork on the place, and they are going to prorate the rent since we are not moving in till midmonth. We are also gonna be putting in apps all over the place and trying to find employment before we get moved up there, because it will make things SO much easier on us if we are already employed. Plus I got a card from the school about their program for finding employment through the school's connections, so I have that option as well.       You know, I bet most people don't realize how many different things they become experienced at when they consider taking a job. I have noticed that a lot of people look at their former job titles and that is how they decide what it is they want to apply for. I have a new system: I take each job that was different, and I make a list(yes, lists again) of everything I did at that job. I mean EVERYTHING, no matter how mundane it seemed at the time. Turns out that I am more experienced than I thought I was, lol. Comes in handy when you have to tell an employer what you can do.       Crashed really hard last night, that makes two nights in a row. THERE IS AN END TO INSOMNIA! YAY! Such a relief to be able to sleep. The only problem is that I have the weirdest dreams after I have had a bout with insomnia. I can never fully remember them about five minutes after waking up, though, lol. I just know they are weird, very strange dreams.       Well, I need to go and get some more coffee and finish waking up, and then pack some more stuff up. Goddess, it never ends...

       Okay I am officially really pissed off...I have been trying like hell to get into a site online, that i was at earlier today, and yet my fucking browser keeps telling me it can't find any such site. so I run a search for the site and it pops up in the search results! AND I STILL CANNOT GET THERE!&nbsp;I swear to the Goddess I am really getting fucking pissed at this stupid fucking machine. If there was not so much money and so much of my life invested in the fucking thing, it would have gone right out the goddamn window by now. I mean, you would think if the search engine could find it, that I could get there, right? WRONG! Apparently not. Stupid fucking electronic piece of shit. One of my friends hates computers, will not touch one whatsoever, and she seems perfectly happy. If i wasn't so dependent on the damn thing, i would just say fuck it. but I can't do that. Besides, I would hate to have to handwrite all of my ranting and raving. That would suck.    &nbsp;  Trying to locate a new host for my website, but there are certain things that I need to have , like the ability to put midis on my site, and a lot of the free sites don't offer that like my current one does. I just hate the fucking fact that it cuts off half of my page, and that makes it difficult to design a proper page. Plus I have a lot of pages, so a new host would have to allow for that as well. Oh well, the search continues...

        Ya know, there are a lot of things on my mind lately, but I am SO glad that I don't have the same things on my mind that one of my best friends does. She left her 9 year old son home, and according to state law he can be alone for two hours. She returned home less than two hours later, and CPS had come and taken him from the home. No one knows why they did, or if someone called, or what the deal is, but she is needless to say, not a happy camper. The part that makes this doubly painful for me is that he is my godson, as well as being my friend's child.     ****Okay, now I am pissed. I just found out that both of her kids have been dragged off by the police and social services. I am pissed as all hell.

      Lists. I make lists. Tons of 'em. All the time. Lists for ordinary things, like groceries. Lists of things packed in a certain box. List of things I need to do. Lists of things I want to do before a certain time, place, whatever. The list I started this morning is:"Companies and People I need to give a new address to when I move". Now, I know, you fill out the little card at the post office, and they change your address when they put that little yellow address sticker on there, but that is only good for like 60 days, and in the meantime, you damn well better be changing your address with everyone you ever dealt with. Plus then there are the places that have my address, but that don't send me mail. Like ebay for instance. And Paypal. Have to change all that information over. Such an annoyance. Broke down and had a cigarette last night, was just going crazy with all the noise the kids were making, and then the tornado sirens went off shortly after I got off the phone with my darling cousin Tina, whom I adore. So we raced to my older sister's house to hide in the basement. But I did make it 16 hours without one. And I have been up for two hours now and have not had one yet. So I am doing pretty well, I think.

      As of 3:07 AM today, I have officially quit smoking. Now if I could just find my husband's missing set of keys, things would be great. Guess I get to stay up all night to rip the house apart looking for them.

      Okay, it is quarter to 8 in the morning, and the phone has already rung this morning. Thankfully two things did not happen:it did not wake me up, and I don't have a hangover. My darling little brother and his boyfriend, both of whom I adore, took me and the two oldest kids and my neice out to dinner last night, and I had several rather large drinks(five kinds of alcohol in each) and came home extremely intoxicated. Now, for most people, three drinks would not be enough to put them over the top, but as I said they were very mixed and very strong, and plus I had not had anything to eat all day, and I didn't eat much at the restaurant. I just had virtually no appetite yesterday. Which I know is not good for my health condition, I should be eating more than I do, but somedays the thought of eating just repulses   me and I can't bring myself to do it. Thankfully, my doctor does not have the faintest clue that I am not eating, as I detest the idea of having to deal with a lecture from him. Bad enough the husband gets pissed when I don't want to eat. Looking around my living room, I am struck by how much stuff there still is that needs to be packed. My huge closet in the hallway is packed full, as is every available shelf in all the bedrooms, and I still have a ton of stuff to get packed up. The books on the bookshelves alone will take up at least six more boxes, and then there is still the books on the headboard of my bed, and in the cabinet above my head on the computer desk. It's gonna take a small fortune to get everything moved, I swear....

      Change is good, right? I hope so, since I have changed the look of my blog, from the formerly sterile and automated version, to this one. I like this one. It speaks to me. *chuckling* That sounds weird, I know, but I am a very visual person, and things spark my imagination a lot, and this template makes me think of warm summer days drifting into cooler autumn, sun setting on water, bonfires on the beach... I am watching one of my favorite comedies right now, Kissing Jessica Stein. You remember my friend T., the lesbian I have mentioned before? Well, she despises this movie because of the ending, which she says contributes to the illusion that all a lesbian needs is a good man. ***WTF???*** I certainly don't get that from the way the movie ends, but she is one of those women who takes anything that applies to lesbianism, no matter how remotely, as being one of two things. Either it is a personal attack on lesbians, or it is absolute fact, and somehow always applies to her life. I love her to death, but she frustrates the hell out of me when she hops on her butch soapbox and preachs to me. She can't even understand why I take offense to being called greedy, just because I am bi. If I was greedy, I would be screwing everyone I could get my hands on and pussy near. I don't do that. I love and adore my husband, and the one woman I can honestly say I love enough to WANT to sleep with is too far away from me at this time. Well, the old coffee cup is empty, so I need to go refill it, I shall return. I am going to get in touch with my friend Trish and have some new pictures done of me, I would love to have her drive up to the Twin Cities with me and do some of them at Loring Park by the fountain, but her schedule is always so full it seems, that I really doubt that I could make our schedules work. I am going to be there again soon, because my husband is going for another job interview, and he is going to be staying there for his new job, so we can actually get money together for the move. Gods, this is such an annoyance. I don't want to be separated from him for even an instant, but we have to do this. I am probably gonna be writing a lot in my blogs and writing a lot of tearful poetry for a while, during this time of desperate loneliness. Hey that sounds like a good title for a poem itself. I will have to remember that. Looks like another gray day full of rain is coming. I love rain, and thunder and lightning, but this is getting a bit ridiculous. I need to be able to harvest my garden, and I would rather not do so when I will possibly be sinking up to my ankles in mud or kneeling in a puddle. Besides, I would rather not have my vegetables drowning. On top of that, I have several pepper plants I need to transplant, and again, can't do that when the ground is this saturated. Maybe I should just transplant them into my big planter and grow them that way. It's always a thought. You know what is funny? I keep noticing that new things that should be listed on my interests lists keep popping into my head, but yet, when I was thinking of my interests, I could hardly think of any. Bizarre...

      Well, I did it again. I have been running around so busy that I have forgotten the purpose of this blog. The reason I started it was so that I could vent my frustrations, fears, all the emotions that wring me out every day. And I haven't been using it like I should. Lately it seems that I have hit a brick wall emotionally. I have so many things going on in my life that I can't keep track of how I should feel about anything, and old fears I thought were long dead are resurfacing, and that both scares me and pisses me off. My neice came to stay with us on the first of July. I adore this child, she is sweet and caring and artistic. She is also troubled. I am trying to make her time here as enjoyable as possible, because she feels so lonely most of the time. Anyway, on to the next thing...I have been running around being driven crazy trying to get everything ready for school. I was so excited at first, and now I am terrified. What if I don't have what it takes? What if I fail to get my degree? What if when I graduate, I can't find a job, and I have wasted all that time? Everyone keeps telling me, oh, honey, don't worry, you will be great, you are gonna succeed and all that, but I find myself suspicious of their sincerity a lot more lately. I am so tired. I am tired of everything. I am tired of being stressed, I am tired of trying, I am tired of my husband coming home and being so tired we barely have time to talk before he dozes off, I am tired of this separation anxiety that Alexx seems to be going through(I can't even leave the room to go to the bathroom half the time, because he freaks out and starts screaming bloody murder...and then he clings and if i try to lay him down, more screaming. I don't know what his deal is, and it frustrates me something awful.) I adore my kids, and my husband is the greatest man in the world, but I am so tired that I am not sure that I have the ability to appreciate them anymore. The only thing that has brightened me up lately has been my neice coming here, because I have to consciously make an effort to make sure she is okay, because I worry so much about her. I have never seen a child so sad, so lonely, so afraid that she is going to do something wrong.  I am going to quit smoking. I tested myself the other day. I went an entire day without a cigarette, and the funny thing is that I didn't lose my temper or get overly stressed that entire day. I then stretched a pack of cigarettes out through three days instead of my usual one and a half.when this pack is gone, that is it. I am done. Now that I know I have the ability to do it, I am going to. Then maybe I can convince the hubby to finally quit as well. He smokes two packs a day almost, and we simply cannot afford that anymore. Well, the kids are all asleep(even Alexx), so I am going to take a little me time, and just bask in the silence for a while...

         People never cease to amaze me. I swear, there are so many egotistical, snobbish people out there in the world. Let me start at the beginning...       I joined a group online that promotes friendship, etc. okay. I posted very clearly I am looking for friends, nothing more at this point in time, because although having a g/f would be nice, it is not the most important thing in the world, 'k? I sent out a bunch of comments to various people, ones who said that they wanted to make friends, didn't matter with who. There was one girl in particular whose profile I liked, and who seemed to have a lot of the same interests as me. She sent a response that I am not allowed to be her friend, because she only allows blonds on her friends list, like herself. But that she would be more than happy to chat and definitely cyber with me. WTF????? How fucking shallow is that? "Oh you can't be a friend of mine, but I will fuck you and talk to you when no one else is around." Fucking cunt. Like I would cyber with her in the first place.       Anyway....still doing the calculating the cash thing. Trying to get enough money saved for the move, etc.Hoping I get my 338.00 pretty fucking soon, or things are gonna be a little tight.
