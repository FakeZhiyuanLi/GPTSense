       Although I was initially worried, it seems as if my blog is coming together.&nbsp; Now I can finally see my second post and my comment on the first post, which before were not visible.&nbsp; I'm very relieved.

       Last night&nbsp;I couldn't sleep until 4 in the morning.&nbsp; I spent about an hour from 12:30 to 1:30 trying to get a pic of myself onto this blog.&nbsp; I wasn't successful.&nbsp; Oh well, hopefully I will be able to eventually.&nbsp; I spent most of the rest of the time listening to the radio.&nbsp; Right now I love The Killers' song "Somebody Told Me."&nbsp; I can't help but laugh during the chorus when he sings, "Somebody told me that you had a boyfriend, who looked like a girlfriend, that I had in February of last year..."&nbsp; It kind of reminds me of how messed up everyone's relationships seem to be these days.&nbsp; In that way it makes me sad.&nbsp; The people at the house across the street are really getting on my nerves.&nbsp; All night last night they were apparently trying to repair a car and a pickup truck which both had some serious muffler problems.&nbsp; I seriously considered going outside and yelling at them, but I was half-asleep and I wasn't about to get out of bed.

       Hi everyone,    This is my new blog.&nbsp; I'm not very good at computer stuff, so hopefully this will come out alright.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please click on the July archives to see recent posts.&nbsp; For some reason they don't appear on the home page of my blog.&nbsp; I'm trying to figure it out, but I'm not having much luck.

       In 8 more days I'll live at Gordon College.  Wonderful.  The other day I heard the Third Day song "I Believe in Love" on a mainstream pop station for the second time.  I was very excited, then I got to thinking about how I'm always waiting for bands I like to "break the mainstream."  I guess the bands I like (with exceptions of U2 and Coldplay) are always alternative or Christian or foreign and out of the mainstream for one of those reasons.  I got really excited when Switchfoot's Meant To Live got so much mainstream airplay.  And Dare You To Move is movin' up.  I wish Delirious was on the radio though.  Maybe someday.

       Note: do not take this post too seriously.  This isn't about the Switchfoot song which has been getting some mainstream airplay lately.  (Go, Switchfoot!)  You see, this morning I was getting really mad about people who do nothing with their lives.  Life is about more than having sex and kids and playing bridge and bingo, all you crazy people out there!  If you're in a bad situation I understand, but if you have no ambition to be better and do something then find a way to buy a gun with food stamps and just.... sorry, got a little mad.  Anyways, I get really mad when people don't live life the way God made them to live it.  As in, guys who say, "Oh yeah, me and my girlfriend live together but we're gonna get married when we have enough money to pay for the wedding."  I hate it when people can't wait till they're 65 so they can play golf all day long.  Lately I've liked the Jet song "Roll Over DJ."  I love last verse which is like, "so you think you're a star/ but a pill-poppin' juke box is all that you are/ tell me it ain't that way/ what's your name?

       Last night youth group was interesting. My friend Shayna destroyed a beehive. I discovered it by sticking my hand in it and not getting stung. After Shayna stabbed all the bees with a metal rod, I asked her if she was allergic to bee stings. (Shayna is allergic to everything. I really mean everything.) She said she was allergic to bee stings. Crazy.  Afterwards, when our youth pastor, Pastor Bill came out and found out he was like, "Boyz...."  It was mostly Shayna though.  I now have 11 days till I leave for college. It will be fun. If you are a friend of mine who stops by, please try to leave a comment. I want to know if you have been here or are just lying to make me feel better.

       I'm finding it hard to believe, but in thirteen days I go to Gordon College.  August 20th will be my first day of freshman orientation.  It seems like its going to be fun.  Recently I've been playing a song I just wrote a lot.  I think I'm going to call it "More Than I've Got."  Its basically about how nothing in the world will really make me happy.  I thought I'd post a little excerpt.  Maybe someday it will be on a cd.  Here's the most random and, I hope, slightly funny part of the lyrics, coming from the last part of the second verse:         Wouldn't it be fun                                                   To meet the American President                                    To give him my autograph                           Ask how he's been since I've seen him last

       I'm back,   I've downloaded a bunch of songs and burnt my first cd.  Its by my Welsh friend Jono's band Megalithic and is called "No Reason To Love."  I don't know why its called that, but its pretty good.  I love the song "Player."  Its about a girl who's a, well, she's a player.  Jono expresses his feelings about such girls, which pretty near approximate my own.  Go to  urlLink http://www.troikamusic.co.uk/megalithic.shtml  to download the album for free.  It has a lot of Beetles influence, a Cardiff pub feel (that's where Megalithic plays most of their gigs), and some interesting ideas.
