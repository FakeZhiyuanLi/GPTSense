        We had grilled chicken legs, baked beans and mashed potatoes for dinner tonight. Washed it down with Dr. Pepper. The only thing missing was Hawaiian rolls--that's a Hawaiian roll kind of meal.

        Heard from the folks that there's a neat bookstore downtown, so will have to check it out.

        Bingham and Tito require their own, special place to play. I have a large playpen, which the gerbils frolic in (in turns, of course), but being a pair of highly territorial males, the two of them can't deal with the scents the other gerbils leave behind.  Last night, when their time came for their weekly cleaning, I put them in the playpen and almost immediatly, they were in a ball. So, after quickly getting them apart (both were fine), I got the huge hamster cage out of storage and used the wire part to keep Bingham and Tito safe, while I rinsed out their tank. I had them in the bathroom with me, so I could watch them, and there were no problems. Both were plastered to the bars of the cage, chewing like madmen. :-)  I honestly don't know where "females are more territorial" comes from. When I first had to do an introduction and came across that statement on quite a few resources, I took heed. However, now that I've had first-hand experience, I know it's the other way around.  Little twerps. ;-)

        I knew it would happen eventually. Spyware has taken over my computer, which means pop-up ads galore. Yesterday, the computer froze multiple times.

         It's almost 1:00 AM and even though I'm tired, I can't get myself to go to bed.  That's not unusual though.  Yesterday, I *finally* went to bed at 8:00 AM.

        There was a "walk-through" this morning, to make sure everything in the house is on the up and up.  So, I went to bed like at 5:30 AM, because (1) I have insomnia and (2) I needed to clean my bedroom, my bathroom and the hall outside of the two.

        Lately, my tastebuds have been craving plain yogurt mixed with either mangoes or peaches.  Blackberries are good too.  I usually sprinkle Grapenuts on top, but it's just as good without them...maybe even better.

        I can barely tell Tito and Bingham apart anymore.  I had to inspect them closely today, because I was wanting to take pictures of Bingham and couldn't distinguish the two.

        Didn't send that down-payment, but did get a picture of Rajah and Pringle sharing a meal.  I'm convinced Pringle thinks he's a dog.

        Hopefully, the gerbils' food will arrive tomorrow.  Also tomorrow, I want to see what that previously mentioned bookstore is like.   And , tomorrow, I want to send off the down payment for that Medical Insurance Clerk course.
