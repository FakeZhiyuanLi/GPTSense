        urlLink      Click image for larger picture    Elizabeth Hulette, known as Miss Elizabeth to wrestling fans, was pronounced dead at the Kennestone Hospital in Cobb County, Georgia at 5:45 Thursday morning. Huelette was 42.     WBS-TV in Atlanta reported that emergency workers were called to a townhouse owned by Lawrence Pfohl (pro wrestler Lex Luger). Pfohl then accompanied the medical personnel as they transported Hulette to hospital. Hulette died shortly after she arrived.     Pfohl was questioned about the death and initially released. He has since been charged by Cobb County for possesion of a controlled substance and is in custody.     "At this point, we don't know if it's a suicide, we don't know if it's a natural death (and) we don't know if it's a homicide," Cobb police spokesman Cpl. Brody Staud told WBS-TV.     Local police confirm that they responded to a domestic disturbance call at the location on Easter Sunday. WSB-TV reported that the police report said that Pfohl was arrested for allegedly beating Hulette, and that he was out on a $2,500 bond in connection with that incident.     It could be over a month until toxicology reports reveal what killed Hulette. Foul play has been ruled out.     Described by many as the "First Lady" of professional wrestling, Hulette was a major name in WWF during the 1980s as the manager of her real-life husband at the time, Randy "Macho Man" Savage. Savage and Hulette joined the WWF in 1985.     On his website, Savage posted a short message. "I am deeply saddened by this news, and our thoughts and prayers are with Elizabeth's family," he wrote.     The Kentucky-born Hulette met Savage in a gym, and worked with the Poffo family's International Championship Wrestling for a time. The family patriach, Angelo Poffo, shared a quick memory with SLAM! Wrestling. "She was a hard worker, she worked hard," said Poffo. "She took a lot of chances in the ring and a lot of dangerous bumps." He hasn't spoken with her since her divorce from Randy.     At her peak in the WWF, Hulette was so recognizable and popular that she was the focus of many major WWF storylines during the wrestling boom. Many of the angles revolved around the pair's off-again, on-again love affair. Savage even proposed to Hulette on a WWE television broadcast in 1992 and married her at the SummerSlam pay-per-view even though the pair were really married in 1984. An episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous was even filmed about the pair.     James Myers, known better to fans as the wrestler George 'The Animal' Steele, was saddened to hear the news of Hulette's death when contacted by SLAM! Wrestling. Myers, who worked an unforgettable "crush" angle with Savage and Hulette in the eighties, remembered her as wonderful woman and hoped that her death would bring about some positive change.     "I had nothing but respect for her. I think she carried herself in a very respectful way during the years I knew her," he said. "It's sad to see a person that young die," Myers continued. "It's such a waste. Maybe these (recent wrestling-related) deaths start opening some eyes and change some lifestyles. Maybe it's not all in vain."     James Harris worked as Kamala in the WWF, and knew Huelette there. "She was always nice and quiet," said Harris. "She stayed to herself, I guess it was because she was with Randy all of the time. I never saw her take a drink, so it's all pretty shocking to me. I could never say a bad thing about her."     Hulette divorced Savage in 1992. After leaving the WWE and disappearing from the wrestling scene, Hulette returned briefly to World Championship Wrestling in 1995 to join the red hot nWo and worked with Savage once again.     She even worked a wrestling match in WCW, a brief encounter with the late Rhonda Sing.     Luger had a decent football career, including time under coach Marv Levy with the Montreal Alouettes of the late 1970s. He got involved in pro wrestling in the mid-'80s in Florida and rose to prominence in Florida Championship Wrestling.     A hot, young prospect, he was brought into World Championship Wrestling and quickly made a part of the heel stable, The Four Horsemen. He jumped to the WWF and Vince McMahon's World Bodybuilding Federation. At first he was a narcisstic heel, but surprised many by turning good and feuding with Yokozuna.    He was one of the early big-names to jump back to WCW during the peak of the Monday night wars, and was with the company until its purchase by the WWE.     Pfohl owns the Main Event gym in Cobb County.

      Must say it was a good trip. I was offered a very very nice settlement and I decided to take it after thinking hard about it for a whole ummmm 2 seconds.&nbsp; So in about 3 weeks I will have a nice amount of money depoisted in my bank account. Not going to tell anyone how much or how little it was. Don't need friends crawling out of the woodwork cause they think I have money now. So yippie for me or something.

      First I must say it was fucking packed! Years back the bars where cram packed every night, but as of late they where always busy just not crammed pack. For some reason tonight it seemed like everyone and there brother was out. &nbsp; I don't get the chicks that go out to bars. I mean they all walk around like there god's gift to men and there not even close. Well most of them aren't. And what's with the chubby girls wearing skin freakin tight clothes? I mean it just looks nasty. I mean i'm not all into looks and i've dated skinny women and women with a few extra pounds. But come on don't wear something that has your gut hanging out over your pants and your love handles all sticking out. I mean be a little more classier you know? &nbsp; Well tonight at Club Vogue they had a thong contest. And of course they wait till late late into the night to make sure all the girls are nice and drink. Most of them werent to bad. I could have done without the really big fat black chick. I mean come on. But of course the chick that won was the one that decided to take off all her clothes. I must say though she was pretty cute. She didnt really need to take her shirt off though cause she was about an A cup. But i'm not complaining. My father always told me anymore then a handful is a waste. So I guess her's where just right. &nbsp; But all in all the night sucked. I'm so tired of Pennsylvania. Tired of seeing the same faces wherever I go. It's just getting played out. There has been talk of me and my family moving to Maine. I think I may be all for it. Just not sure yet. Only time will tell..........Got to get to bed. Lawyer meeting in a few hours. Who am I kidding? Go to bed? I don't sleep....Oh well Till next time............

Even though last Thursday when I was out I was drinking Molson xXx. Thats some good beer. If you wanna get ripped that's a good beer to drink.  &nbsp; Only downfall of Thursday nights is waiting till 10pm to go out. I like to get out a little earlier, but it's all godo I guess.

      Well here comes yet another birthday for me. God damn i'm getting old fast. Feels like I just turned 21 yesterday. And here I am turning a big 27. These birthdays can stop anyday now. I mean come one. Father time slow the fuck down already.  Don't see myself really getting anything from anyone on my birthday. Guess that has a lot to do with not really having any friends or knowing anyone with a lot of money. But if someone is reading that and has more money then brains here is a few things I sure would like to have:  PSX2 (Mine Broke Few Months Back) mp3 Head Unit for Car Sub-Box for Car New Rims Body-Kit Spoiler Digital Camera Shell Account Web Hosting Account Clothes Shoes Night Out on the Town Lap Top Sanity A Dog (my dog of 17yrs died a few months ago) Money  I'm sure there is tons of other stuff, but I guess it don't matter cause I wont get anything off that list anyway. But if you feel sorry for me BUY ME SOMETHING!!!!

      Talk about shitty weather for being the middle of July. Man usually it's in the mid 90's here at least. And what are we stuck with? Mid 60's. This just isn't right. Mother nature just isn't being very nice. Well I guess she is just being your typical female.  Anyway, I so freaking bored. I really need to get a life or something. I don't mind spending a lot of time being alone , But this is getting a little carried away. Well tonight's Thursday so most likely I will be out and abotu with my friend Rob at Front Row. One of the  local bars we go to. Can't drink as much as I would like cause I have a meeting with my lawyers tomorrow at noon. Don't think it would be a good idea to show up there in a drunkin stuper you know? Wouldnt look good for my case. Lawsuits take way to damn long. I don't understand it. Wish I didn't have to deal with all this, but I dont have much of a choice. It's all bullshit if you ask me. Just sucks I have to spend the rest of my life with an achey leg cause of some dumb ass drunk chick. I went from feeling like I was 18 with a spring in my step everytime I got up in the morning to feeling like a 60 year with a bad hip. Oh well hopefully I will win my case so I can get back to the doctors. I tell you medical care is way to expensive.  Well I think I rambled enough for now so I shall sign off now. Till Next Time..........

      Yet another boring freaking Saturday day. Last night wasn't bad. Ended up going over to someone's house and played Nintendo till like 6am. Man it's been a long time since I played that stuff. It was fun though. I was around a lot more people then i'm used to though. Must have been about hmm I dont even know how many people. Sure was better then sitting in my room alone which I spend most of my time doing and i'm not sure why.  My birthday was alright. No one really remembered it was mu birthday, but thats ok. I've had better night, but i've also had worse nights. Don't think I wanna do any tonight anyway. I feel so burnt out. Which is odd cause I dont do anything.  Made my car look a little nicer yesterday. Least I think it looks nicer. Put yellow & black racing pedals on and ripped of few things out of the interior and painted them. Man I need to practice painting. I didnt do so well.  Anyway its to damn hot in this computer room right now to sit.  Till next time.

      Well it took me 27 years to get to this point in my life, but it's finally here. My 27 th birthday. God damn i'm getting old. Feels like I was just turning 21 yesterday. Time sure does fly doesn't it? They say time flies when your having fun. But most of the 6 years since my 21st birthday havent been fun so what the fuck. &nbsp; Not sure what i'm doing for my birthday yet. Could be a lot could be nothing at all. Not really sure yet. Guess the day will tell.  &nbsp; Today I had to put brakes on my car. I have to get it inspected later on today. Sure was a job and a half. I mean putting brakes on isnt bad, but holy hell! The lug nuts on my car where something fierce. I had it when an auto garage uses those damn air wrenches to put shit back on. Makes it really hard to take off with the dinky little wrench you get with your spare tire kit. &nbsp; My friend Jeremy did all the work though. Well the putting of the brakes on. That was really nice of him and stuff. &nbsp; Here I sit 2am and bored of my fucking ass. Sure wish I could sleep like normal people. Maybe if I ever get a normal life I will sleep normal. Will that ever happen? Probably not knowing my luck.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Why i'm bitching. GOD DAMN ITS HOT IN HERE! Like sitting in the center of hell. Shit i'm sweating and i'm not doing anything but typing. Oh well I had enough of this. Till next time. Toodles.

           The 46-year-old actress has stunned Hollywood by showing off her toned bod in a photo shoot for Rolling Stone magazine.   Stone slipped into a skimpy bikini for a sexy spread as part of the promotion for her latest flick, Catwoman, in which she plays a cosmetics executive obsessed with eternal youth.   Fans will soon be able to see even more of the American star - Stone has signed up for the sequel to her steamy 1992 movie Basic Instinct, after settling a legal battle with producers over her pay and perks.   Word is that she will reprise her nude scenes from the original movie.

      &nbsp;  If you had purchased $1000.00 of Nortel stock one year ago, it would now be worth $49.00.  With Enron, you would have $16.50 left of the original $1000.00.  With Worldcom, you would have less than $5.00 left.  But if you had purchased $1000.00 of Coors (the beer, not the stock) one year ago, drank all the beer, then turned in the cans for the aluminum cycling price, you would have $214.00.  Based on the above, current investment advice is to drink heavily and recycle.  It's called the 401-Keg Plan

      Minisink Hotel is a little dive type biker bar near my house that I will go to every once in awhile. Last night wasn't really a great night to be there. I just didn't seem right when I was pulling into the parking lot. I mean usually there is a few bikers in there, but not a whole lot. But tonight the parking lot was crawling with them and there was a shit load more inside. And every single one of them was wearing Pennsylvania Hells Angels jackets. Not the friendliest bunch of guys thats for sure. And I tend not to crap from anyone. I dont care how big or how many of you there are.  &nbsp; It's just not right when you have about 30 guys walking around a bar with clubs, sticks and mag lights. You know there where looking for trouble cause most of them werent even drinking just staring everyone down. I was doing my normal standing in a corner by myself. A bunch of the locals that always go there I guess told me to come over and stand by them so I was singled out by them for being all alone. But I didn't really care one way or another. But all in all it was a boring night just like most of my nights are. Oh well can't always have fun huh?

      I'm really starting to wonder why I even bother go out on Thursday nights. It's the same garbage week after week. It's just not any fun anymore. For one I think the bars me and my friends go to we are just getting to old for them. I just feel so out of place. Like the people I was out with tonight Rob (31), Ray (29), Patty (28) and whoever else was out. Either way we are going to bars for college kids. It just doesnt seem right. I feel like half the time I am babysitting not out enjoying myself.  Actually I think i'm just getting tired of this state. Can't wait for my settlement money cause I dont wanna be here anymore. I just wanna go somewheres where no one knows me and I can start nice and fresh. All I want is to get married and start a family. I think its time to grow up!

      I tell ya I get so sick and tired of it raining all the time. It seems like thats all it does anymore around here. Kind of makes the summer suck. Even though it sucks anyway. Must saying this summer is lonely and depressing.   It rained about 80% of the summer last year and so far this year probably about 70% of the time. I just wish I had more to do. You can only watch so many movies, read so many books and waste so much time on here. But oh well shit happens.  I'm sure life will pick up once I get my settlement check which should be in about a week hopefully. Thats the worse thing knowing you have so much money comming, but at the present time you sit with nothing. Oh well good things come to those who wait I guess. Well i've been %^&#*#& waiting. Anytime now.  Wonder if anyone even reads this crap I write. I certainly know I wouldnt waste my time, but thats just me.   What shall I do with the rest of my day. Sleep? Read? Movie? Hangself? I'd go for a car ride, but thats not to fun alone or when its raining. Oh well enough of this for now. Till next time.

      Well I was woken up this morning much earlier then I am used to, But it was alright I guess. I got woken up with a phone call from my lawyer. I thought today would be the day I get my settlement check for my accident.   Well it wasnt. My check came, But I had to go to my lawyers office sign the check and hand it back to him. That really sucked. He has to put it in the clients bank account and wait for it to clear. Then he will take his cut then issue me a check. He's making out with 33% of my money. I dont think he really deserves that much but whatever.  Now I have to sit and wait about 10 days for that fucking check to clear. It really shouldnt take that long or at least I dont think it should. Leasts I know its almost over so its all good I guess.

           Submitted for your examination: The June 2004 cover of celebrity reciprocal-handjob rag Interview, and the cover of the Aug. 19th issue of Rolling Stone, where she's looking a lot less chesty. Did Lindsay Lohan get--gasp gasp--a breast reduction? OK, maybe not. But she did tell RS that "if you say you're a Democrat, that'll turn off Republicans, and that's half of your fan base," so maybe she's trying to be everything to everybody. Give the breast men something one month, and then throw a bone to fans that like their teen queens with a little less on top. So savvy at such a young age, but God, those new, small breasts are totally fake!

I think about your face And how I fall into your eyes The outline that I trace Around the one that I call mine Time that called for space Unclear where you drew the line I don't need to solve this case And I don't need to look behind  Close my eyes Let the whole thing pass me by There is no time To waste asking why  So I'll run away with you by my side I need to let go of this pride Until this echo in my mind  Before this echo can subside Do I expect to change The past I hold inside With all the words I say Repeating over in my mind Some things you can't erase No matter how hard you try An exit to escape Is all there is left to find

      Stephen Baldwin has signed on to host the third season of SCI FI Channel's original series Scare Tactics, replacing original host Shannen Doherty, who has left to pursue other projects, the network confirmed. SCI FI has ordered 14 new episodes of Scare Tactics, a half-hour hidden-camera series produced by Hallock Healey Entertainment.  "It's a hilarious show, a lot of fun," Baldwin said in a statement. "It's more fun than I anticipated. The producers get my sense of humor." He added: "It's been interesting coming on board [to an established show] and working with the producers to create a new feel. There's a more spontaneous, high-level energy feel to the show. ... I'm excited about opportunities in the future for whole new levels in Scare Tactics. I think we can take this show to places it hasn't reached yet."  Doherty completed eight episodes of the second season. "Shannen was a great fit for the show and really helped get Scare Tactics the attention it deserves," series producer Scott Hallock said in a statement.

      I really need to get one of those things. You know those things. What's everyone calling them now a days? A life is it? Well I need one of them. I'm so freaking tired of doing nothing. It gets damn boring. I mean i've been hanging out with more people then I usually do. It's just there not really my type of crowd. There nice and all, but there just trouble I believe. I need to find new friends. Actually I need to find a different town to live in. Nah a new state. Which may be the case anyway soon. But you know how it goes. You get bored wherever you go once your there long enough. It's just the way it is. When the newness wears off its just like it always is.  Sitting here right now watching the NASCAR race. It's at the local track here this weekend. I kind of hate it when its here cause it makes everything so damn busy. I dont leave my house though so I guess it doesnt really matter all that much anyway. Life has got to get better right?

      All I know is last night (friday) I must of had way to much to drink or something. And you know why that is? I brought a kitten home with me. And I can't stand cats. I'm a dog lover. Anyway I went over to Linda and Barbra's house to hang out and Stephanie was there also. And a few others. But Barbra had brought a few kittens home with her that someone left in a box outside of her job. When I first got there this one little kitty ran right up to me and hopped on me. And it pretty much stayed there the entire night. I even named it spooky. But the more a drank that damn cat got cuter and cuter and when I finally left to come home around 5am or so I decided to bring it with me.   The cat sat on my shoulder the entire ride home watching me drive and I thought that was pretty cool. Thought maybe I had the wrong idea about cats all these years. Got home crawled into bed and the cat snuggled up next to me and fall asleep also. First the cat ended up sleeping on my arm then my head then my back. But come about 11am or so that fucking cat decided my back looked like a damn scratching post. And that made me remember why I dont like cats. So I got myself dressed quick and me and that kitty was going for a ride back from where I got it. I swear that cat was trying to make me crash kept jumping on the dash and getting in the way and then to top it off  it decided to take a monster shit on the floor of my car. I never smelled cat shit before that. God damn is it rank. I had the windows up and the a/c on and all the sudden it hit WHAM. Thought I was gonna puke. Little fucker is lucky it didnt get tossed out the window. But anyway the cat is back where it belongs now. Thank God!

Over the course of almost 9 years in the 1970s the Zodiac Killer took the lives of over 13 people, either stabbing or shooting them to death in or by their vehicles. All the targets were the same, couples in cars off rural roads.    Taunting cops the Zodiac Killer would send in encrypted messages to the local papers, describing how his past victims had died, and who would come next if they didn't post his message on the cover of the newspaper the following day. The only surviving witness described the zodiac killer as a heavy set man in a self fashioned hooded jacked that covered his face, brandishing a crossed circle that he always signed his letters with.    After 1978 the killings stopped, the Zodiac's case was never solved.     Kill count: 13    urlLink Find what serial killer you would be, Take the Serial Killer Quiz now!

      The Giants won a football game Friday night, but more importantly they found a dependable running back who can contribute some big plays. And they didn’t have to look far to find him. Ron Dayne, given a new lease on life by Tom Coughlin after a season of inactivity, scored on second-period runs of 29 and 67 yards in the Giants’ 34-24 preseason-opening win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Giants Stadium.

      Well I shaved showered all that good stuff and got dressed t go out. Even went to the MAC machine and got some money and I did all this for nothing. Here I dont usually leave my house till my friend actually calls me, but I figured since I had to do a few things before hand I would just leave early and show up at his house.  Major waste of time. I got to my friends house and he was getting into his car and he told me he couldnt go out cause he had to go to the hospital. Which I mean I understood and wasnt mad cause shit happens. Just figured the one night I leave my house early.  Here my friend made his wifes two kids something to eat on there gas stove and he forgot to shut the gas off. So after they ate he put the kids to bed and decided to take a nap. So three hours later his wife come home and could smell the gas and her everyone was sleeping. So they took her kids to the hospital to make sure the gas didnt affect them or anything.  So I had my typical night home which i'm getting so used to anymore. AND IT FUCKING SUCKS!

           AUSTRALIA could be on the brink of a startling underwear revolution, thanks to Gold Coast couple Jan and Chuck Digney ("just your average mum and dad") and their invention: the backless brief.  Jan had a visible G-string problem and asked her daughters for advice.  "They said they freebag it, basically, `We don't wear undies Mum."  "Well," says Jan, speaking after a champagne-fuelled lunch to celebrate the launch, "there's got to be something out there to stop people from doing that".  She worked through 50-odd prototypes before arriving at a design that replaces the back with two bra-style straps under the bottom.  "It's like freebagging but you're protected," she says.  The challenge, says Chuck, is to get people to believe they stay up.  The couple has spent $300,000 on the first run of 35,000 and patenting the invention across the world.

          Plot Outline:  Joey leaves New York for Hollywood in order to take his acting career to the next level. He also says goodbye to a time when his friends were his family and welcomes the chance to turn his family into his friends. After reuniting with his high-strung sister Gina, Joey moves in with Michael, his 20-year-old genius nephew, who unbelievably is literally a rocket scientist. However, what Joey lacks in book smarts he makes up for with people smarts - making him the best new friend his nephew could ask for.   What I thought:  I just got done watching the pilot episode for this show. And I must say I thought it was very very good. Really funny. Just like friends without everyone else, but Joey. hehe. So glad they gave Joey a spin-off show. Cant wait till it starts to air weekly next month.

       An amateur ghost-busting kit for householders who suspect their home might be haunted is being tested prior to possible full-scale production.  The kit includes various instruments designed to help catch the paranormal presence.  It can also be linked to the internet, allowing homeowners to keep an eye out for ghostly goings-on while away from home.  Cable company Telewest Broadband has worked with a group of specialists in paranormal investigations to put together the kit, which is currently undergoing tests.  It includes motion and humidity detectors, a temperature monitor and electromagnetic meter to spot subtle changes in the room which could show a ghost is present.  A webcam connected to a computer automatically starts filming the room if any of the detectors are triggered.  Absent homeowners can check whether any abnormal activity has been reordered by connecting via a broadband internet connection.  Telewest Broadband said the kit would cost in the region of £150, including the monthly internet connection, if it went into production.  Chad Raube, director of internet services at Telewest Broadband, said: "The meeting of ghost hunting and modern technology is a fascinating combination.  "We are always looking at ways to bring the possibilities of broadband to life, and this fairly inexpensive kit could allow paranormal enthusiasts to join in at home."

       Revelations       Premise:  A scientist faces challenges to his belief system when forced to give rational explantions to what appear to be signs foretelling the Apocalypse. A nun plays Mulder to his Scully as the two of them attempt to stop the coming Armageddon.  From What We've Seen:  This limited series could be a serious thriller, or it could be super-cheesy; the limited footage NBC had available at its upfront presentation made it tough to say which. It feels like a faster-paced, less oblique version of the short-lived ABC series "Miracles," complete with eerie, Scripture-quoting children and bad guys given to pronouncements like "You think this is the end?"  Stars:  Bill Pullman ("Independence Day"), Natasha McElhone ("Solaris"), Michael Massee ("Se7en"), Tobin Bell ("The Road to El Dorado") and Chelsea and Britney Coyle  Studio:  Pariah  Producers:  David Seltzer ("The Omen,"), Gavin Polone, Vivian Cannon and Jessika Borsiczky

Her rocket scientist husband goes from being a skeptic to a bemused believer as she embarks on solving crimes across the country. From What We've Seen: Although the show is based on a true story, selling audiences on a woman who can see and communicate with the dead is no easy task. The trailer played like "The Sixth Sense" grafted on to a cop show, and featured dialogue like the main character telling a skeptical cop that "I just felt" what happened to a murder victim.  Stars:  Patricia Arquette, Jake Weber ("U-571"), Miguel Sandoval and April Grace  Studio:  Picturemaker Productions and Grammnet Productions  Producers:  Glenn Gordon Caron ("Moonlighting," "Now & Again") and Kelsey Grammer ("Frasier")

          Everything was just ducky on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Monday morning (Aug. 9).  Donald Duck received the 2,257th star on the legendary Hollywood walk. The beloved Disney character was joined by his pals Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Daisy Duck and Pluto for the occasion and to also celebrate his 70th birthday.  Johnny Grant, Honorary Mayor of Hollywood and Chairman of the Walk of Fame Committee, presided over the event and Leron Gubler, President/CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spoke on behalf of the organization. Michael Eisner, CEO of the Walt Disney Company also showed up for the festivities.   Donald made his screen debut on June 9, 1934 in the Silly Symphonies cartoon "The Wise Little Hen." His trademark quack was voiced by Clarence "Ducky" Nash for 51 years, a job that has been taken over by Disney animator Tony Anselmo later.  The sailor-suited duck has appeared in numerous shorts and features. In 1943, the anti-Nazi film "Der Fuehrer's Face" won an Oscar for best animated short film. He also stars in "Saludos Amigos," "The Three Caballeros," "Mickey's Christmas Carol" and "The Prince and the Pauper."  Donald next appears in the direct-to-DVD release of "The Three Musketeers," the first feature-length film ever starring Donald, Mickey Mouse and Goofy together.

         Hoping to borrow a successful move from the network's old playbook, FOX is welcoming back former "Beverly Hills, 90210" good girl Shannen Doherty as a "North Shore" bad girl.  Doherty, who recently left her gig hosting Sci Fi's "Scare Tactics," will begin a multi-episode story arc on Monday, Sept. 20. The former "Charmed" star will play Alexandra Hudson, the illegitimate daughter of hotel magnate Walter Booth (Christopher McDonald). Alexandra is sure to stir up tons of trouble with new-found sister Nicole (Brooke Burns) as soon as she hits the beaches at the Grand Waimea.  FOX obviously hopes that Doherty's arrival will goose the somewhat stagnant ratings for the sun-soaked summer soap opera, following in the footsteps of Heather Locklear's successful addition during the lackluster early days of "Melrose Place." Certainly the show could use a boost. Through its first six episodes, "North Shore" is pulling in an average of 4.63 million viewers per week. FOX has ordered extra scripts beyond the show's initial 13-episode order, but the network isn't ready to commit to additional episodes. The possibility of Doherty's continued role on the show could provide incentive for FOX to extend the "North Shore" run.  However, for every successful Locklear Injection, there have been at least as many fizzled experiments, like The WB's unsuccessful attempt to welcome Carmen Electra to "Hyperion Bay" in 1999.  FOX already had mixed results earlier this year when "Beverly Hills, 90210" good guy Jason Priestley became a "Tru Calling" bad boy. Priestley's arrival had little impact on that show's ratings, but his presence reportedly gave the show a creative boost and helped to score a second season renewal.

      LOS ANGELES (Zap2it.com) - Director M. Night Shyamalan, known for his films' surprise endings, may face a legal battle regarding the plot twist for his latest film, Disney's "The Village."  Similarities between "Village's" story and that of children's book "Running out of Time" by Margaret Peterson Haddix are prompting publisher Simon & Schuster Inc. to review its legal options, reports Reuters.  The 1995 book centers on an isolated 19th-century town run by adults who are hiding a heavy secret from their children. When a life-threatening disease cuts through the town, one child must be told the secret in order to find a cure.  Shyamalan's titular "Village" is also set during the 19th century and concerns a secret about the surrounding the woods.  Haddix first began hearing about the similarities during the film's first week out from fans and journalists. When she finally viewed the film, Haddix commented, "Let's just say that I saw the same similarities that other people have pointed out."  The author had optioned the film to the Viacom Inc.-owned Nickelodeon, which never ended up making the film before the option expired. Simon & Schuster is a publishing arm of Viacom.  "This is a children's book...that sold more than half a million copies and won prizes, so it's not an obscure book for us," says spokesperson Tracy van Straaten.  In a statement, Disney and Shyamalan's Blinding Edge Pictures expressed that they do not believe the claim has any merit.  "Running out of Time," was nominated for an Edgar Award, which recognizes the country's top mystery stories. Haddix has written numerous other children's novels, including the popular "Shadow Children" series.  "Village" has grossed $85.6 million since its opening on Friday, July 30.

       CHERNOBYL, Ukraine (Hollywood Reporter) -- You might have thought that Chernobyl was off-limits, closed to the outside world behind a rigidly patrolled exclusion zone since reactor No. 4 went into catastrophic meltdown April 26, 1986, spewing radiation to the four winds.   Not a bit of it. The reactor's deadly core was buried in a concrete and steel sarcophagus, but the adjoining reactors carried on producing electricity until they were finally decommissioned a couple of years ago.  A rotating staff of some 6,000 specialists and technicians still work at Chernobyl's scientific center. Hundreds of journalists, diplomats and tourists have been here in the past six years since the place was opened up to paying visitors, once safe areas away from the isolated and still highly radioactive "hot" zones were identified.  Some 40 documentaries have been shot within the vast controlled zone that rings Chernobyl and the nearby town of Pripyat.  Now, for the first time, a Hollywood feature film -- the zombie movie "Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis" -- has gained access to the infamous site.  Ukrainian-born producer Anatoly Fradis is proud -- despite the obstacles and the cost. "Up to a couple of days before we began shooting, it was touch-and-go whether they would let us in, and I had to pay more than I had budgeted to secure the permission," Fradis says, standing inside Chernobyl's first checkpoint inside the zone.  He's anxious to get started on two days of shooting on-location with director Ellory Elkayem and special effects zombie expert John Vulich of Optic Nerve Studios.  For a zombie movie, there's an odd lack of gore-covered extras with vacant stares. A 1960s open-top, Russian-made Chaika limousine serves as a rock-steady rolling camera bed for 11 scheduled shots here.  Most of "Necropolis" -- the fourth in a five-part series shooting back-to-back -- is shooting at the Bucharest, Romania studios where "Cold Mountain" was made.  The zombie-free Chernobyl scenes are for the opening, in which a rogue ex-CIA agent is seen stealing the world's last five canisters of Trioxyn gas, the lifeblood of the living dead.  "Chernobyl is very spooky and serves our purpose -- we are shooting in all these abandoned towns and villages, with rusting equipment lying around everywhere," Fradis says.  The sense of a post-apocalyptic world dawns as we follow the Chaika around the Chernobyl district.  Grass and shrubs sprout from holes in the sides of crumbling cottages. A graveyard for helicopters, fire trucks and other equipment used in the cleanup operation in 1986 stretches beside a road. In Pripyat, the deserted town that once housed the reactor's work force and their families, children's toys still litter the rubbish-strewn kindergarten, and fading Soviet slogans adorn the sides of gaunt concrete apartment blocks.  It's an unsettling experience that should translate into a chilling opening sequence, perfect for a movie titled "Necropolis."

         A winged cat has been killed by villagers near the Central Russian city of Kursk. The locals drowned the deformed puss after believing it was a messenger of Satan, the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper reports.  On entering her yard, Nadezhda Medvedeva saw how a stray cat stood up and, just like a chicken, stretched out two wings. She said that at that moment her hair stood on end. The locals had no doubt the unlucky cat was a messenger of the devil, the Vlasti.net website writes.  Where the cat came from and why it appeared in the village of Bukreyevk nobody knows. Nadezhda Medvedeva, whose home is located on the edge of the village, said she initially heard a soft meowing.  “We poured some milk into a bowl,” Medvedeva recounted. “A tom cat came out — ginger, huge, twice as big as normal. He drank greedily and started meowing again…asking for more. We started feeding him. After a couple of days my daughter came running in all scared and whispered: ’Mom, come and look at the cat! He’s got wings!’”  Nadezhda Medvedeva went out and saw how the cat slowly moved its wings exactly as a chicken would. The woman immediately came to the conclusion that the cat was sinister, “just like a sort of devil”.  The daughter, having already named the cat Vaska, claimed he was affectionate and had obviously been a pet.  The rumor of the winged cat soon reached Kursk, but by the time a correspondent got wind of it the cat had already been killed by a local drunk, who drowned the unique feline. A sack with the animal’s body was recovered later from a pond near the Medvedev’s home. Despite the fact decomposition had already set in, the correspondent form the local Komsomol newspaper confirmed the cat did actually have wings.

      America Online (AOL) confirmed the existence of the software vulnerability in an AIM feature that allows users to post automatic replies, such as "I'm away" messages, to instant messages (IMs) that they receive. The company is planning to release a test version of the AIM client later this week that will fix the hole, said Andrew Weinstein, an AOL spokesman.  The security hole was discovered by iDefense Inc. of Reston, Virginia, a computer security intelligence company. A flaw in an AIM component called the "goaway" function allows an attacker to cause a buffer overrun on machines running AIM. Attackers could trigger the flaw by feeding a large amount of data to the goaway function, possibly using a URL (uniform resource locator) embedded in an instant message to the user.  In a buffer overrun, space in a computer's memory allocated to hold data is exceeded, allowing the attacker to crash vulnerable applications or place and run their own code on the vulnerable computer.  All known versions of AIM for Microsoft Corp. Windows are affected and, if successfully exploited, the AIM away message vulnerability would allow remote attackers to run code with the privileges of the user who launched the AIM application, iDefense said.  However, AIM users would have to click on the URL to trigger the vulnerability, which will make it harder for malicious hackers or virus writers to use it in automated attacks, Weinstein said.  The vulnerability reinforces the importance of using caution when clicking on links in IM messages, especially when they are from unknown correspondents, he said.  IDefense discovered the vulnerability and informed AOL about it on July 12, the company said. The company released an advisory on it Monday only after computer security intelligence company Secunia Inc., of Copenhagen published an advisory warning of the hole, citing information provided by two security researchers who also had discovered the hole.  AOL will encourage AIM users to switch to the beta AIM client when it is released. Alternatively, iDefense recommended changing a Windows configuration setting to protect systems from exploitation. (See: http://www.idefense.com/application/poi/display?id=121&type=vulnerabilities.)  AOL does not know of any customers who have been attacked using the security hole, Weinstein said.  Long popular with home computer users, instant messaging is increasingly being used in the business world. After trying to market, then abandoning its own corporate IM gateway, AOL is now working with third party corporate IM technology companies to integrate its instant message technology into corporate applications.

          When you read the the above sign, did you say "the" once or twice to yourself.  Most people miss the second "the" when the sign is first read.  Send this trick to a friend to see if they fall for it.

          Step 1: Stare at the above image and focus on the four dots in the center.  Step 2: Continue to stare for 45 seconds.  Step 3: Slowly find a wall in the room and look close up at it. You should see something on the wall. Try blinking a few times.  Do you see something on the wall? If this doesn't work for you at first keep trying.

         I really like this song so I thought I'd put the lyrics here and the background music to it. Hope you enjoy.   "Broken"  I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away I keep your photograph and I know it serves me well I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away You've gone away, you don't feel me, anymore  The worst is over now and we can breathe again I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away There’s so much left to learn, and no one left to fight I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away  'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone away You've gone away You don't feel me here anymore

      Today just sucked. It started sucking soon as I crawled out of bed after a whole like 30 minutes of sleep. &nbsp; I had told one of my moms friends I would drive her up to Wilkes-Barre cause she had buisness to take care of up there, but she didnt know how to get there. So I agreed even though I didnt wanna just cause I have issues with telling people no. &nbsp; Now generally my time to sleep is during the day time. So this threw me off from the begining. So I was grumpy as shit this morning. So anyway we leave to go and I go out on Interstate 80 and where cruising a long and all the sudden bam traffic is no longer moving. We sat there for like an hour cause some dumbshits got in a wreck and there car burst in to flames. I mean damn do that shit on your own time. &nbsp; Well I know how to get to Wilkes-Barre, but only to the places I go up there. So someone else decided to get me Internet directions. Let me tell you DONT FUCKING TRUST INTERNET DIRECTIONS. Normally when I got to WB it will take me about 40 minutes give or take. Well the directions from the net had 24 steps to it. The last 14 total horseshit. Soon as you got into WB you wanted to take the 2nd right. Now the directions have 14 turns instead. And they had the name of the road wrong. So somewheres that takes me 40minutes to get to took me about 3 hours.  &nbsp; Then the lady went inside to take care of her buisness and I ended up sitting in the car for another 2 hours. And it was hot as shit. COuldnt put the windows down cause it was pouring rain and the A/C was making my head hurt worse. &nbsp; So anyway she finally comes out and we had home. And guess what road construction! So the ride home took 2 hours. Today just sucked major ass. &nbsp; And I dont know what kind of games my lawyer is playing. I just want my money. I signed the check already and everything and he said 10days to clear. Well today is day 14. I bet the fucker is just drawing intrest off my money!  &nbsp; Anyway I should sleep now...........

      &nbsp;The 15th season of MTV's "Real World" franchise began in Philadelphia, was briefly homeless and finally returned to the City of Brotherly Love. The fruits of this tumultuous process are set to premiere on MTV on Tuesday, Sept. 7.  After ditching Philadelphia amidst protests from local unions, the reality veteran ultimately made nice and shot the season with minimal controversy. It's doubtful that the show's labor strife will merit even a mention as viewers watch seven strangers move into a 10,000 square foot home in Philadelphia's Old City.  The new "Real World" crew will spend their time working for the Philadelphia Soul, an Arena Football team owned by "Moonlight and Valentino" star Jon Bon Jovi. They also build a playground for Northern Home, a local care center for troubled youth and spend quality time in Fiji.   Even with all of that scheduled activity, the houseguests probably manage to find time to enjoy Philadelphia's active bar scene and the two hot tubs (one hot, one cool) in their house.  The show's seven member cast features the usual assortment of mainstream-quirky attractive young people: &nbsp; &nbsp;   Name:  Karamo  Age:  23  Hometown/Current residence:  Valley Village, CA  Pithy MTV-Provided Description:  Raised in Houston by Jamaican-born parents, Karamo had an "upbringing that was filled with strong anti-white prejudices." Although his racial opinions may cause tension in the house, he keeps an open mind and "lives his life for others and gives much of his time to charities, politics and non-profits." &nbsp; &nbsp;   Name:  Landon  Age:  24  Hometown/Current residence:  River Falls, WI &nbsp; Pithy MTV-Provided Description:  MTV warns viewers that "when you think sports fanatic, think Landon." A member of the water skiing and wakeboarding teams at the University of Wisconsin, Landon doesn't like to be thought of as a "dumb jock." He's still getting over a seven-year relationship with his high school sweetheart, but he "loves female attention." &nbsp; &nbsp;   Name:  Melanie  Age:  22  Hometown/Current residence:  Santa Cruz, CA  Pithy MTV-Provided Description:  A recent attendee of the University of California at Santa Cruz, Melanie "believes if you follow your heart, you'll be happy." She also is "spontaneous," has "a wild streak" and "loves to dance and party," which mix well with her aspirations of becoming a high school English teacher. &nbsp; &nbsp;   Name:  MJ  Age:  22  Hometown/Current residence:  Nashville  Pithy MTV-Provided Description:  Not to brag or anything, but this recent Vanderbilt grad is "good-looking, blond, hard-bodied southern boy with a warm heart." MTV says that in college, MJ "played the role of the star football player," which either means he appeared in a theatrical production of "Necessary Roughness" or that MTV knows nothing about the quality of Vanderbilt football. MJ entered the house in the midst of a two-month relationship. &nbsp; &nbsp;   Name:  Sarah  Age:  22  Hometown/Current residence:  Tampa, FL  Pithy MTV-Provided Description:  In addition to graduating from Emory and planning to attend law school as the University of Florida, Sarah is "attracted to bad boys" and she "afraid to use her sex appeal to get what she wants." The opinionated Florida native has overcome an eating disorder, but still struggles with her weight. &nbsp; &nbsp;   Name:  Shavonda  Age:  21  Hometown/Current residence:  Murieta, CA  Pithy MTV-Provided Description:  Shavonda had a "turbulent childhood," but went on to become the first African-American homecoming queen at her high school. She's putting herself through Grossmont Community College and is "the life of the party." She has a boyfriend and wants to be faithful, but she also "loves attention from guys." &nbsp; &nbsp;    Name:  Willie   Age:  23  Hometown/Current residence:  New York City  Pithy MTV-Provided Description:  A child actor who appeared in commercials, musical theater and on the show "Ghost Writer," Willie has been living on his own since he was 15 because his religious parents don't accept his gay lifestyle. He isn't afraid to be confrontational, possessing his family's "stubborn" gene.

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  LAS VEGAS, Nevada (AP) -- Hotel heiress Nicky Hilton married a New York money manager before dawn Sunday in an impromptu ceremony, according to court filings obtained by The Associated Press.  Hilton, 20, married Todd Andrew Meister, 33, at the Las Vegas Wedding Chapel, according a Clark County marriage license. A woman who answered the phone at the chapel declined comment.  "Access Hollywood," which first reported the wedding, said older sister Paris Hilton and actress Bijou Phillips were present during the 2:30 a.m. ceremony.  The Hilton sisters were in town for a Stuff magazine party at the Palms Casino Resort, where they were joined by Meister and Nicole Ritchie for dinner late Saturday, resort owner George Maloof Jr. said.  Maloof, who confirmed the ceremony had taken place, said the couple gave no indication of their plans.  Nicky Hilton, younger sister of "The Simple Life 2" star Paris Hilton, has dabbled in acting, appearing in "Wishman" in 1991 and presenting at MTV award shows.

      This is really sad. So much for this Olympics dream team huh? What a freaking joke. They really need to stop calling them the dream team and start calling them the US Nightmare team. Only true Dream Team was the 92` Olympic team. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ATHENS (Reuters) -- Puerto Rico upset the United States 92-73 at the men's Olympic basketball tournament on Sunday, the first loss at the Games for the three-time defending gold medallists since 1988.  The United States never led after early in the first quarter.  The&nbsp;Americans&nbsp;were down by 22 points at half-time and by 17 points after three quarters. Utah Jazz guard Carlos Arroyo led Puerto Rico with 24 points. Tim Duncan had 15 for the Americans.  Puerto Rico had never beaten the United States in Olympic play, losing all five of its previous matches.
