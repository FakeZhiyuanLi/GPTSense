      Recently Times of India had done some interviews with some Prostitutes, Pimps etc and discovered a shocking revelation. Most of the prostitutes were actually well-educated girls from well-to-do families, into this profession for just some extra money (read fast money) or some fun. It was really painful to read their revelations and stories.  Some of the links to these stories can be found at Indiatimes at  http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/756224.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/756175.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/757775.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/755364.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/754002.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/754880.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/753991.cms http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/754659.cms  The first reaction I had after reading this article was that of disappointment and shock.  It was really disheartening to read that some girls can stoop down to such a level that they would have to take to this 'business' in order to make quick money.  If it was an uneducated girl having problems in her house, and if she takes to prostitution, it is understandable, although she has options like taking up jobs like that in a Construction Site, or as a Maid Servant or a Municipality worker, etc. or any other menial job. If it was an educated girl having problems in her house, and if she takes to prostitution, it is deplorabale because since she is educated, she can very well take up a atleast some respectable job, and not prostitution. If a girl has been forced into prostitution by somebody, even then it is understandable because the turn of events in her life have landed her here, and it is important that efforts be done to save such people out of this profession.  But, the most shameful thing is, an educated girl, coming from a well-to-do family, taking to prostitution, just for extra money, or for fun. There could not be anything more shameful than this that one could have imagined. It depicts the fragile state of mind of such 'loose character' females who do not have the emotional strength to take up more challenging jobs worthy and pertinent to their education and skills.  According to Swami Vivekananda, "unless it held and developed the spirit of true womanhood, there could be no education of woman worthy of the name." For him, true womanhood consisted in "the old-time intensity of trustful and devoted companionship to the husband,"  It gives me pain to see this state of today's the so-called 'educated' and 'liberated' woman. I used to have atleast some respect for women seeing their achievements in a Man's world and was happy to note that they were proving to be as good as men in every field. But my respect for women has gone down drastically after reading these articles. This is not how our culture was supposed to  be. We are in a phase of largely aping other cultures and we have neither succeeded nor failed.  I had learnt that Education can make even an Animal to behave like a Human. But these article prove that wrong. Inspite of being educated, some people still remain animals. It is utterly shameful to note that a woman who has donned different roles like that of a Mother, a Daughter, a Wife, etc, has taken to this role - that of a commodity - and that too, by choice.   I think the law in our country is very liberal in the way it approaches the issue of prostitution - either forced or willing.  I guess, that  1. Prostitution should be totally banned in our country and alternative sources of employment be provided to every prostitute. 2. Any person accused of rape should directly be put in jail without any case or hearing. Later, it should be verified whether he has done rape or not. If he is proved guilty, he should be hanged to death mercilessly. If not, then he should be set free. It doesn't matter even if he spends some days in jail. 3. Any woman getting into this business willingly should be put in jail directly. 4. Any person found guilty of forcing another woman into this profession should be hanged to death.  I do not understand what these 'well-educated' females feel when they see themselves in the mirror and say to themselves "Have you been faithful to your family and to God?"  Maybe a stricter law would prevent these otherwise 'loose moral' females from getting into this business for money and fun and rather do some decent job that would not make them feel ashamed when they stand in front of God in their house, every morning.  If God gave me one opportunity to punish these people, I would shoot all of those 'well-educated' 'loose moral' females who have taken up this act for extra money. I only wish that the women realise their mistake before it is too late for them, their familes and for the country.

      Hi Friends,  Daily I spend so much time thinking about so many things that happen everyday in the world. I talk over these things with my colleagues, my friends, my family. But then, something was missing. I wanted a free space where I could express my opinions without anybody's interference, and listen others' opinion on them. I first thought of writing a book. But then my work does not give me enough time to go back home and write a book. Or maybe it may, if I manage my time efficiently. But then, I came across this thing called Weblog. Although I had known about this earlier, I had never actually created one of my own. So here I am with my first blog. I hope that the topics that I take up might help you also to start thinking. That is my aim.  Have a nice time reading !  regards, Rajasekhar

      You might be thinking "Why does this guy always write about women only?" But then you have to understand that a woman is the mother of the human race. Mother Nature, Mother India, Mother Teresa, and Mother...women. I personally feel that the direction taken by the human race, towards good or evil, is determined by a woman. And only a woman can stop it, if the world is going towards destruction. A woman is a repository of strength and energy. You learn your first words from a woman. You take your first steps in this world by holding a woman's hand. You choose a woman as your life partner. You turn to a woman when you need strength. But as one rotten fish can spoil the whole pond, today there are some 'rotten' fish that are bringing a bad name to womanhood (As Swami Vivekananda says, "true womanhood consisted in the old-time intensity of trustful and devoted companionship to the husband"). I have seen these so called 'educated' women with the most 'rotten' thoughts that are really making some men lose their respect for women. You might understand more if you read the other articles on this page, as I do not want to bring the same topics here once again. But I have one thing to tell. Swami Vivekananda said once, "O India! Forget not that the ideal of thy womanhood is Sita, Savitri, Damayanti." He categorically asserted that "the women of India must grow and develop in the footprints of Sita, and that is the only way." Indeed, for him, the ideal of Hindu womanhood remained, as these names make it manifestly clear, chastity and loyalty to husband. Development of true womanhood was thus the primary goal of women's education. As Nivedita had written, according to Swamiji, "unless it held and developed the spirit of true womanhood, there could be no education of woman worthy of the name." He declared in Detroit that "the girls of India would die if they like American girls were obliged to expose half their bodies to the vulgar gaze of young men." It is a surprise that the same women today are willing tonot only shed their clothes at the drop of the hat, but even go further without any hesitation just to make more money. For all the women who are voluntarily taking this path, It is a Shame on you and womanhood as a whole. Women have 33% reservation in most places. I used to consider that the very fact that they needed 33% reservation meant that they were weak and cannot compete against men with their talent and will power. But then many women made us proud by reaching to the top posts in this country in various fields, and I was proved wrong. But the very fact that you women are making use of rotten activities to make more money proves that you are still weak. You cannot make a mark for yourself either with your talents or with your skills. Shame on you for resorting to cheap methods to make money. It makes my blood boil when I read such articles about women. It might be because of my respect towards women that was embedded in me from my childhood. For all the women who are not into any such activities, It is high time you get united for a cause for the sake of womanhood. If you do not take an action to eliminate these rotten activities that some of your daughters, sisters, friends, neighbours, etc have taken up, then the day is not far when more and more women will fall trap to their words and women will be nothing but commodities for sale, everywhere, explicitly or implicitly. Raise your voice at the first instance there is an attempt to exploit you or any of your peers or if you see a woman getting into shabby things. Take charge in your hands to retain the respect that some men still have for women in this world.

      When I was doing my Engineering, I had this dream of going into movies. I wanted to be an actor. Although I did not put any efforts into becoming one, but whenever I came across my friend's uncle (who was a well-known Telugu Actor) or another of my close friend(whose distant relative was a Telugu superstar), I couldn't stop thinking about those precious minutes of fame.The film industry seemed to me as a get-quick-rich industry where I could make a lot of money with only my talent (which I thought I had enough, although nobody in my family had ever been in movies). As days progressed, I moved my focus more onto my first love - My desire to be a Software Engineer - and there ended my dream of becoming an actor. But that did not stop me from reading about films, the actors, the trends in the film industry, and the happenings. Maybe that is why it hurts me while I write this article.I used to hear about struggling actors being exploited for roles in movies - which some of them never even got - both the sexes alike. But as we all would agree, being a woman in a Man's World is the worst thing to be. I then read an article about 4 years ago in one of the leading newspapers about how a struggling actress was interviewed by a very well known director to cast her in her movie, and then how he had proposed her to sleep with him in order to do the favour. That really shocked me !! But then, my more knowledgeable friends told me that this was common in an industry where the few minutes of fame can make one do anything. Do you mean ANYTHING? Yes ANYTHING. As the Pandora's box opened, more and more things came to my knowledge and I realised that the industry that I once considered as 'ROSY' and 'NEWCOMER-FRIENDLY' and 'TALENT-BASED' was not exactly what I thought it to be and there was more to it than what appeared to the eye.So what is that drives the film industry? Is it Sex? Is it the Underworld? Or is it both? What I realised is that it is both. There were stars who were related to the Underworld in influencing the outcome of the movies or the casting of the movies or the distribution of the movies. Then there were stars who eloped with the men from the dark. Then there were stars who flew all the way to the abode of the Underworld to favour them. Then there were stars who acted as a double for the more popular stars to replace them in compromising scenes in a movie. And then, many stories, many articles.All that glittered was not really Gold !!! Then I happened to come across this story of a struggling actress who was raped 16 times in a period of 5 years by a well-known director on the pretext of being offered a role in one of his movies, which finally did not happen. And she broke the news out. Shocking? True. Read the story at  urlLink http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/789587.cms   urlLink http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/789610.cms   urlLink http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/788327.cms   urlLink http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/789054.cms   urlLink http://www.indiafm.com/feature/04/jul/2607couch/index.shtml   urlLink http://www.indiafm.com/scoop/04/jul/2607preeti/index.shtml  This lead to a lot of other shocking revelations and questions too. The first revelation was that this sort of a you-favour-me-I-favour-you system had existed from a long time in this industry. In one of the articles above, one model says "Even before producers and directors ask them to sit down in their office, these girls are lying on the couch. It's basically an established barter system. 'You give me what I want, I'll see what I can do.' No guarantees." Now that is something that is astounding to read. One of my friends has a relative working with a very reputed Entertainment and Media Firm in this country that has interests in Aviation, Real Estate, Politics, Cricket, Advertising, etc. This guy told my friend about what he saw at almost all the lavish parties of this Firm, which were a platform for bringing together the filmstars and the politicians. He said that almost in all the parties, most of the top stars would end up drinking heavily and lying unconscious on the couches here and there, while the half drunk politicians would end up putting their hands in the wrong places for some fun. I also came to know from my friends that there were some people who could deliver you any woman - right from a Medical Student in a top college in Bangalore to the most popular actress you can name - all for a price ranging from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 2 Crore !! Some of the top film stars have come out themselves in the past about their relationships with their co-stars. A famous heroine of the yester-years got pregnant from a well-known director and married him after making him divorce his first wife.In yet another article above, a struggling model says "I'm an NSD passout and looking for work in Mumbai. It's accepted that you get a role only if you sleep around. Just last week, I was propositioned by the assistant of a famous director. I was offered a role subject to my fulfiling three sexual acts described to me in graphic detail. When I refused, the role that was 'just right for me' became 'come later'. There's hardly a break with no strings attached." Also, A British wannabe Bollywood actress narrates an interesting incident, which confirms the existence of the casting couch to the core. Anna Edwards felt it unbelievable when she was informed that she had landed herself a role in this mega budget bollywood movie. But what followed almost threw this 23-year old into a tizzy. On the next meeting in the producer's office, he darted the question, “I have given you a role in my movie, what will you give me?” The girl at once realized the situation at hand and fled in good life. She is now a popular television star in UK and opines that Bollywood isn't the dreamland that it is made out to be. Looking at the other end of the story, this kind of a rape can only happen when there is a consensus. But again as it is said in the article, there is a very thin line between rape and consensus rape and maybe this is why it is difficult coming to a conclusion on such cases without taking the underlying situation into account. The point to be noted here is that if the director, after sleeping with the actress for 16 times, gives her a break, then would this news have come out? And, is it justified for an industry to have such a system in place? Isn't there a law that can protect the exploitation of these newcomers and allow them to raise their voice against these producers or directors the moment they are asked for sexual favours? Or Is there already a law in place which is not being properly utilised for the benefit of the common man? Whatever be the case, it might be the case that many a talented actors/actress might be out of the place they actually deserved because of some money-hungry, sex-hungry producers and directors who would not give talent a high priority against their hunger.Let me see if I can write more about this in my next article.

      Hi Friends, Long Time No See !!! Well, the past few days have been quite hectic, and I have managed to take some time off to write something. Now, this is supposed to be a blog where I am supposed to log my thoughts. So I will see what best I can do to put my thoughts on paper...oops...keyboard !! Generally, I think a lot, a lot, a lot about things around me and happening around me. Some disturb me, some make me happy, some enrage me, some make me smile. Now let me see if I can atleast touch upon some topics out of these. Enjoy. Bye.

      Well, the papers and the websites are flooded with all sorts of news on why and how she took this extreme step, but did she take the right step? Actually, it is meaningless to discuss this question since she is already dead and gone. But, those who are still alive and contemplating death for various reason...STOP...THINK AGAIN..Is Death the solution to your problems? Farmers are committing suicide in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and other states, because they are unable to repay their debts. Students are committing suicide because they did not pass in their respective examinations. Lovers are committing suicide beacuse they have not been successful in love. Why? Did the Farmers' families repay their debts by committing suicide..maybe if the government considers their death and grants compensation, but has it happened always? Can you ensure that every farmer who has committed suicide till date has been considered by the government for compensation from the state? If you actually dig into facts, you might find only a fraction of the farmers compensated. What did the students achieve by committing suicide because they failed in an examination -mostly tenth or twelfth? Aren' t there their friends who have also failed but have had enough courage to say that "Maybe better luck next time. This is not the end of my life." Taking one's own life is the biggest sin you can ever commit. Even the holy scriptures like Gita and Bible consider it as a sin. God has given you a life with a purpose. Every person on this face of earth has a purpose. Sometimes the purpose is trivial and may not bring about catastrophic changes in this world, sometimes it might not bring you name and fame, sometimes it might not bring you money and power, but it might be just enough to touch somebody's life. The thought of death results from an empty mind, a mind that does not have any direction, any ambition, a purpose in life. Everybody has problems in life. The man eating in a golden plate, the man flying in the high skies, the man on the footpath, everybody. If there were no problems in life, man would be as good as a vegetable. The only reason we are not vegetables is because God has given problems, be thankful for that. Atleast to overcome the problems, we think, we work, we cry, we laugh, we strive to eliminate them. The best way to overcome such thoughts is to be restless for success. Be greedy for fame. Be mad to reach your goals. Strive hard to fulfill your ambitions. Think of alternatives to reach your goals. If one alternative fails, choose another, if that fails, then another. Don't stop until, at the end of the day, you get what you wanted. Set small goals for each day, set big goals for the month, set bigger goals for the year, adn keep working to achieve them. Failures are the stepping stones of success. There are innumberable examples to quotes the truth in this line. Read about all the successful people in any industry. The only reason they are successful because they did not get discouraged from their failures. Infact, every failure gave them more and more aggressiveness and restlessness to become successful. And last but not the least, Where there is a will, there is a way. If you kill your will, the ways are closed for you. I am not a PMA Teacher nor am I a preacher, but my life goes by a very simple policy - Whatever goes around comes back, so give happiness, get happiness. Life is too short for you to experience it 100%, but then you can still strive to make it 100% happy by living life to the fullest. And most importantly, I have a goal, that makes me wake up every morning an think of ways to achieve it. You will see me at the top...very soon.
