      ...It comes up with the craziest news stories, here's another of my favourites, especially as i have been to Germany and can understand where the lorry driver is coming from.....  BERLIN (Reuters) - A German truck driver has beaten up a motorist he believed was driving too slowly in a case of "road rage" in a country famous for having no limits on stretches of its motorways.  The trucker got in a fight with a car driver who had been slowing him down by observing a 30 km-an-hour (18 mph) speed limit in a built-up area.  Police in the western town of Bochum said the truck driver told them he felt provoked by the motorist "because he was actually driving 30 kph in a 30 kph area". The trucker faces an investigation and may lose his driving licence.

      Italian couple say "I do" in shark tank  CATTOLICA, Italy (Reuters) - Most people get married flanked by friends but an Italian couple tied the knot in a shark tank surrounded by the creatures they want to save.  Daniela Consolaro, 31, and Maurizio Andreosi, 40, each wearing bubble-helmet immersion suits, were lowered in a cage into the shark tank at the aquarium in Cattolica on the Adriatic coast on Saturday.  Fourteen sharks swam around looking bored as the couple -- his nickname is Bull Shark and hers is Nurse Shark -- responded "I do" to Mayor Pietro Pazzaglini, communicating via a phone link.  The couple wanted to draw attention to finning, a practice where fins are cut off for use in shark fin soup, considered a delicacy in Japan and elsewhere in Asia.  Environmentalists say the practice is severely depleting shark populations around the world.

      Postmen bite back over dog treat  The makers of a postman-shaped dog biscuit have been given something to chew over after their product was taken off some stores' shelves in Canada.   The Pet Valu chain store agreed to remove "Bark Bars" from their 292 outlets after the Canadian postal service failed to see the funny side.   In a letter, the service pointed out the dangers dogs pose to mail carriers.   In the first six months of 2004 alone, there were 160 dog attacks on post deliverers, said Canada Post.   The dog treats come in such flavours as garlic, fish and chips, and Parmesan cheese.   They are shaped as the supposed worst enemies of man's best friend - postmen and cats.   Pet Valu president Ed Casey said he had decided to withdraw the biscuits after receiving a "cordially persuasive" letter from Canada Post.   He said his company already had a policy not to stock goods that could offend postal workers but "the biscuits sort of fell below the radar", reported the Winnipeg Sun.   A Canada Post spokesman said the issue was "very serious".   "I will tell you, personally, I think it was in very poor taste, considering the hazards that our carriers have out there every day... we have some very, very serious dog bites and people are hurt quite badly. I thought it was in extremely poor taste," John Caines told the Globe and Mail.   He said a female postal worker in Chatham, Ontario had both wrists broken and part of her ear torn off in a recent dog attack.   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the manufacturer of Bark Bars, American Health Kennels, told BBC News Online:   "We are saddened by this situation because it was never our intention to offend anyone.   "The shape of our biscuits is simply a 'tongue-in-cheek' marketing effort to differentiate our product from other dog biscuits," said Tammy Ross.    Many thanks to the BBC for this one, as i always tell you Chris they're a funny bunch Canadians.

      As a follow up to a previous post, Robert Key went on to get 221 against the Windies (not that anyone cares about cricket who knows me), however i would like to say that the West Indies stink so it isn't as great as they make out. Vaughan got a century as well, its good to see the old boy scoring some runs.

      Today's activities included washing up champagne glasses for 3 hours, carrying tables around the school aimlessly and shifting crates of booze into fridges. Thats right it was the day before the wedding. Irfan Latif's to be exact (he's a teahcer at my school) and he recruited some of the most willing prefects (i.e. those wanting the money) to help out with the setting up today, and at the wedding tomorrow (its all being held at our school). So i'm bummed cos i've spent my day with my hands in the sink. Any way he has offered us free food tomorrow, and free access to the rave-party in the evening!!! Although i did hear rumors of free booze!!!! Today really did suck.

      I know my freinds across the pond won't appreciate the significance of this post but it is defiantly news worthy in england. Robert 'Fatty' Key scored a century in the first test against the Windies today which is bad news for everyone like me who doesn't think he is any good. Although, Andy Strauss did as well, and i met him at Whitgift a couple of years ago and he is a top bloke, so well done Straussy!

      We bought this new digital camera (a cannon) today, to use at the folks wedding anniversary, and for other bits and pieces so hopefully i'll be able to use it to get some images up. We'll see, knowing my luck with technology it probably won't happen. Lets cross our fingers......

      Well i failed my driving test again this morning. It wasn't even my fault this time, the examiner said that as i was approaching a mini-round-about i didn't observe correctly, the trouble was that i did everything my driving instructor told me to do!!!! I'm pissed of as well, cos now i have to wait untill the end of October to take it again, unless i can get a cancellation!

      Although recently i have been struggling through my books and not up to much (as is seen by the lack of posts) things have suddenly become very hectic. Chris' return, cleaning up for the party on sunday (and triming hedges etc) while continuing to try and read as much as possible are occupying a lot of time. As are the natural thoughts and what-have-you which come with the expectancy of exam results (tomorrow-thursday), so everything has got quite hectic which is nice.

      I've got to apologise for the supreme dearth of interesting thoughts, i've been so busy with this, that and the other,t hat i havn't had any time! Let alone the fact that our computer isn't 100%! Anyways, our gardener has finsihed up at last, have re-done all the beds, and turfed the top of the garden. I'll try and get a photo up at some point. I was up at 5:15 this morning for an early trip to Lingfield in order to do Geography field work, it sucked pretty bad. I've still got stacks of work to do so i better get to it.

      On the opening day of the premiership season boro managed to screw up a great chance to get an early 3 points on the board with some crap defending. Firstly Riggot's effort of kickign the ball, and the Zenden's shocking tackle in the box resulted in 2 Newcastle goals which should never have been, although Jimmy F-H did handball it into the goal. Another mediocre season has just begun i reckon!

      While south croydon has a reputation for being dirty, crime ridden and just generally crappy, amidst the sun yesterday i spent a fantatsic afternoon in the fore-court of 'Boulevard' resturant which although lookign straight out onto the busy roads of south croydon and 2 bus stops, offered a strangely odd and detached atmosphere from the hussel and bussel of 'city' life. The food was great too!

      So as time goes on and the reading gets progressivly longer and more borin, i thought i would take a minute to update everyone on what has been happening. That is to say, nothing. Everything seems to be geered towards the wedding anniversary a week on sunday, however the more pressing issue is that of AS results being given outnext thursday (19th) :( . I'm not looking forward to them at all!

      On friday night Big Brother 5 finally ended (although i know some of you are devastated), Nadia the portuguese woman with the cackle laugh won, and broke down and started to cry, i had to chnage the channel it was making me cringe. Anyway, for everyone that wanted me to post about Big Brother there you go.

      As the new premiership season approaches, the apprehension of previous years has vanised as an optimistic air has fallen over Boro fans the land over. Viduka, Hasselbaink, Parlour, Reiziger... the list goes on and on and we might actually have a realistic shot at Europe this year!!!! We can only hope.

      Who said a holiday was for doing nothing? I've sepnt the last week and a bit reading for my Uni application form, and today i started writing a 3000 word essay which will be one of my submitted pieces to Oxford, therefore it needs to be good. The title: 'To what extent did Thomas Cromwell affect a revolution in government in the 1530s?' is hardly the most thrilling, and it has just involved reading loads of different chapters of loads of different books (twenty odd-my rooms a mess). What's worse is i've only done 750 words and am struggling already :( , i'm tired, fed-up and bored. I just had to tell you guys this before you start complaining about the dearth of interesting thoughts around here, my life has lost all interest, but i'll try and find some good stuff for you!!!

      "A German prisoner in Madrid and his girlfriend glued their hands together during a jail visit in an attempt to fight the man's possible extradition to Germany, judicial sources say.  The pair were taken to hospital, where doctors were considering whether to operate or use a powerful solvent to separate the man's left hand from the woman's right.  The glue is a type normally used in car repairs.  Spanish police arrested the 39-year-old man in the southern city of Cadiz in April on request from Germany, where he faces accusations of smuggling women from Eastern Europe to force them into prostitution, the judicial sources said.  The Madrid court studying the extradition request will not make a decision for several months, they added on Thursday. The man has a separate judicial case pending in Spain and authorities want it resolved before any handover to Germany."     (yahoo news)

      As Alice http://prettyinpigtails.blogspot.com/ reminded me, that is has been about a year since we were over there in vancouver. For those of you who havn't been it was totally awesome, especially as the whether was great. So my recommendation is for everyone to go visit. I'll hopefully be visiting again some day, cos it has been the best place i've ever visited. And Alice do you have the recipe for that fruit crumble you cooked us 'cos that was top notch, and you know how much i love my food!!

      My family have gone garden crazyin preperation for the 25th wedding anniversary. A gardner comes in twice a week to do the flower beds, the sprinkler is on most of the day, and the lawn is mown every day (well maybe not every day). Its driving me nuts, but it does look nice!

      Oweing to a lack of postings from everyone who knows about the blog i asked a few of you guys what was wrong and it appears that because i'm not saying anything about 'Big Brother' (delibrately) your not gonna say anything. Therefore in a bid to increase my ratings i will for the last week of Big Brother give a few of my thoughts (which also means i have to watch it :( )   As it is the last week things have got a bit stale because all of the house mates are worried about who will win, however the joy that was Michelle getting evicted on Friday stilll tastes sweet. I'm hoping that when Stu comes out of the house he will ignore her completly and increase my happiness!
