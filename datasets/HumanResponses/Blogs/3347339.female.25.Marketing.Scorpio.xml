      Its after 1:00 am and I'm not tired.  Surprise surprise.  I have that feeling like you get right before you start bawling...only nothing is coming out.  Like I'm constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  Like if one more thing happens, one more thing goes wrong or changes, I'm going to fall into a million pieces and never come back.  My mind just never settles.  I can't turn it off.  I can't stop thinking about him.  What he's doing, how he's been, whether he thinks of me.  Does he remember all the good times we had and miss it so much.  Does he dream about me like I do him.  Do I consume his thoughts everyday, like he has been doing to me?  Or has he moved on already, has he found someone else, is he too wrapped up in his life to even give me a passing thought.  My heart aches not knowing any of the answers.  I feel like my mind is never going to stop thinking about this, never going to stop spinning over and over and over about the same memories, the same feelings, the same sadness.  Everything I do, everything I see gets overshadowed by him.  How do I make my mind turn off...how do I forget about him?  Sometimes, I think that if I could just realize that there is someone else out there that will make me 10 times more happy than he ever did, I'd be okay.  But I can't imagine it...I can't picture it.  I don't know if anyone else will ever want me and deal with all my flaws.  I feel like maybe this was my only chance and now rather than accept the fact that he is gone, I need to accept the fact that I was meant to be alone.  I've become a bitter, angry, sad and jealous person.  Jealous of everyone around me, people I know, and people I don't know, who seem to have things going their way.  I try and remember that outward appearances can be deceiving, but its hard to think that when you are at a store and see two people holding hands, or you read the paper and see all the engagement pictures.  I want all that...I want to be on the way to being married, I want to build a life with someone.  I just always thought it would be him.  I never thought we wouldn't make it somehow.  It was like my mind told me we were the invincible couple.  We had lasted through it all and that myself and others just expected that we would be together forever.  I guess I was wrong.  Now, my life is supposed to go back to what it was 8 years ago.  A life I don't even remember.  I don't know who I am without him in my life.  He was with me in those "development" years, when I formed myself.  College and shortly after, when I figured out who I was and what I wanted in life.  He was with me during that, so naturally, the person I became was somewhat revolved around him.  He was an integral part of who I became and who I am now.  So now that he's gone, do I start over?  Is that possible?  How do I figure out who I am now?  I feel like I don't have an identity.  So much of what I was was because of him...I feel like he took a big part of me with him when he left...a big void.  A part of me is missing, and I'm not sure how to put the pieces back together.  I guess I'm not good at change.  Everything in my life feels like it is changing.  It makes me want to run away.  Put myself up in a hotel far far away where nobody knows me, nobody can find me and where I don't have to face reality.  Just lay in bed, lay by the pool, and be alone forever without having to deal with all the uncertainties.  I want stability in my life.  My therapist says thats something I've never had.  I always thought you couldn't want something you've never had...but that is something I want so badly.  A relationship I can count on no matter what obstacles come along.  Friendships that I can trust, people I can talk to.  A life where I don't feel so alone against the world.

      So this is the first time I've done this...not sure why I am.  Just want to talk to someone...guess this is as good a place as any.  I've had some major changes in my life lately, and I'm not quite sure how to deal with it all.  My boyfriend of 8 years "needs his space", and my therapist says I exhibit minor symptoms of borderline personality disorder.  I'm thinking about going back to school for nursing, and I my finances suck.  Everything seems up in the air lately.  I'm trying desperately to come back down to earth, but its been hard.  I'm not used to being alone...having time to do stuff like this.  This is so weird talking to my computer screen like this.  I hope it helps me sort things out...that's really what I want to do.  Just figure it all out, make it make sense again.  Its been a long long time since things made sense.  I'd love to be a kid again.  Play Barbies all day.  I hate being a grown up.
