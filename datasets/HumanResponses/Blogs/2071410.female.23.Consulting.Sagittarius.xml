After you've been hurt... ....learning to forgive ....learning to trust and love again  But the hardest thing really is learning to love yourself. We always forget to do this.

      I wasnt prepared for this day.  I even woke up late this morning so I got to the office a bit late... 9am is a bit late for me though.  Anyways, this afternoon I had a review meeting for our Release 4. My stupid Outlook did not warn me about the meeting. Well it usually pops up something to remind me about the meeting but this time it did not pop anything.  I was 15mins late for the meeting.  I even got lost when finding the meeting room.  It was on the 4th floor which I have only visited once. I had to call hanna and ask her to guide my way in finding the meeting room. During the meeting, it was mentioned that my team has sent the erroneous package last week and they even had the document written about it. waaahhh!!! that was so rude of them! It was just one mistake that I can never take back! Well, too bad i can never turn back time.  It's been done.. well at least I have learned something from it.   This week, I have learned something important... Never trust the package. A second, third and fourth test on the package will not hurt. Bad thing is that I have to learn it the hard way.  I really feel sad about it... I feel depressed and tensed.  My two bosses know about it but our big boss back in Manila does have any idea about it. yikes! This matters to him a lot because my company is supposed to receive a bonus if we can deliver perfect packages all the time. This is so depressing!   I wish something good happens to me this week.  The past weeks has been so bad for me.  Problems and more problems about work just keeps coming. I know god would not give me problems that I cannot solve. But what the heck... I am a good person and I dont deserve this!

      Finally I had the urge to write a blog again! Last week and this week has been really tough.   First, the sudden shutdown of the server instances of our application in the production environment. This was really bad since I had no idea why they were shutting down.  People here in the Nokia office has been panicking.  I am all alone and I have to give a solution to these panicking people.  Not to mention they flooded my email with their complaints and the Project Manager called for an emergency meeting about this errors in the server. I can't help but panic too.  For three straight days, they flooded my mailbox! Imagine how much emails I had to answer just to make them shutup.  Well, I actually wished that their mailserver will fuckup so i'd stop receiving their mails. As last week ended, we found a solution to this matter and the PM praised me and my company for acting fast on this. My boss in manila even thanked me for doing a great job.  Second, just when I thought I can breathe normally now, another problem came... the deployment package last monday was not working properly.  I tried looking at the logs but I didnt find anything.  I was so clueless! As always, the client panicked again! The package was for the new version of the software in QA environment. Emails again was flooding but only less than that of lastweek's. Since I did not find anything wrong with the package, I just suggested to the client to redeploy our package.  Third, hanna was about to go home at 4pm.  Manila team was also asking me to send an email about the changes in one of our documents then forward it to the client for reviewing.  Hanna was also waiting for me to give her a solution to the erroneous package. waaahhh!!! what am I supposed to do first?! they both gave me deadlines at the same time and both are not easy to do. wtf do they think I am? wonderwoman or something?!  Fourth, when I got here in the office this morning, I was greeted by a not so good mail. The client has redeployed the package as I suggested yesterday but the errors were still the same. They were getting the same errors like yesterdays. And so I asked for Manila team's help since I was so clueless once again.  They sent me another package... I had to test it first before I had it deployed to the client's QA.  Just imagine how slow my pc is!? It took me hours to test a stupid package! Client panicking, computer so slow... get the picture?? When I got the new package from manila and tested it, I had to make a very sincere apologetic email to the client. Waaahhhh! as if it was my fault that the package that was sent to me earlier was fucked up.  Fifth, the client was happy that I finally corrected the error that appeared since Monday.  The problem now is we have this quality assurance guarantee to the client.  it is either we get this percentage of bonus if we deliver good stuff or not get it at all.  It seems that after this fucked up release, we wont be getting that bonus anymore?! my boss will surely be so mad about this.  Sixth, Im so damn tired and tensed the past week. I hope this panicking and problems stop coming out while im alone here. This is too much for an experience.  Both client and my bosses has been praising me for a job well done but it isnt enough to make my work a little bit easier. It's not my fault to be workaholic, take my work seriously and being organization savvy.  I just hope destiny doesnt take advantage of these qualities of mine! I badly need a break!!!
