      Today i was about to catch a bus to go to the nearest shopping mall to reload the credit for my handphone. As i was leaving my room my land line rang. I answered the call and the conversation is as follows (ill call the telemarketer "clown"):  ME: Hello  CLOWN:Hello ME: Hello  CLOWN:Hello im calling from the xxxxxxx company and i would like to know if you would be interested in our latest offer.  ME: Ok. (being such a nice guy)  CLOWN: Do you own a handphone?  ME: Yes  CLOWN: do you have a prepaid?  ME: Yes  CLOWN: Our company has a new plan. You can get a Nokia 3XXX(forgot the number)camera     phone for free.You know you can take pictures with it.(duh if not why would it be called a camera phone??) All you have to do is pay $29.90 a month.Thats all you have to pay a month. No regis.. bl bla bla bla blaa kukublaaa. You can keep the same number you are using. All i need is your particulars.  ME: Sorry i cannot accept your offer because i have reloaded my phone.(LYING)  CLOWN: But sir we can let you keep your old number.  ME: look im really sorry but i cant accept this offer.  CLOWN: Ok ill let you speak to my supervisor to confirm about this offer.  CLOWN'S BOSS: Hello my name is blablablababalbaaa.ballablabakukublallkukujiau.  ME:Im really sorry but i cant accept your offer.  CLOWN'S BOSS: But you can keep your own number.  ME: But i just reloaded my credit so this offer will be of no use to me.  CLOWN'S BOSS:Sir, your payments for the first three months will be credited.  ME:Sorry but im an international student so i will have to consult with my parents first.  CLOWN'S BOSS: Your an international student??  ME: Yes.  CLOWN'S BOSS: Hold on  The supervisor hands the phone back to clown.  CLOWN: So sir your an international student??  ME: Yes.  CLOWN:So sir are you working??  ME:No  CLOWN:I see. Are you over 18 years of age??  ME: No  CLOWN: I'm sorry sir but it seems that you are not elligible for out offer. So sorry for bothering you.  After this pointless conversation i head down to the bus stop realizing that i just missed the bus by a minute or two.And me being impatient and also due to the fact that the next bus will only pass by 30 minutes later, i decided to walk to the shopping mall. And i tell you that walk lasted me 30 minutes. This all the fault of that silly telemarketer. If that brainless person would just have checked with the phone company for particulars or something then this stupid conversation would not have taken place. But one thing is for sure this clown sure is relentless. He would probably do anythig  to sell his products. Probably would burn buildings down and sell his own family just to sell his junk.Well the lesson learnt is just say "NO, Not Intersted!!" and hang up the phone before he drags you into a pointless conversation.

      I was walking home through the park last night and i saw something moving under a tree. I freaked out so i went back onto the road and walked around the park instead of through it. Then the figure started approaching me at top speed. I walked fatser but the thing was gaining on me. When it caught up to me it was standing in the shadow of a house, so i couldn't see its facial features. I guess it was a face only a mother could love. Then it turned into a stupid boy wearing spectacles running around with a wand and fighting "monsters and evil wizards". I then took out my super weapon, a giant two handed sword which i have endowed upon the name "Idiot Slayer" and i chopped the monsters head off. I went home and immediately afterward I got an e-mail stating that i have won the Nobel Prize for Peace because of my chivalric action of subduing the monster.The End.  P.S. They dont want to give me the $ 1,000,000 cheque that they are supposed to give. I could have died, who knows what that monster could have done to me!! They should at least give me some compensation for what i could have lost!

      Oh no, the dreaded exams are coming.Is this a good thing or a bad thing?I should be studying now yet i am sitting in fornt of the computer and blogging.Well i doesnt really matter anyway because i am a champion.Those silly people who came up witht the idea of exams should realize that exams are pointless.The true purpose of exams is to separate the study freaks from the lazy people.Sadly i am not under any of these categories as i am a champion. After the results are released you can see many different emotions.This is the best part because when i see other people i fell good about myself for being a champion and for not being categorized as a failiure!!  For those with the joyful looks on their faces, they should be flogged in public for getting good grades or for just the fun of it.If someone scores high marks then automatically those people who scored low marks will be seen as stupid people. The best way out is for every student to form a pact where evry one of them swears by the hairs on their genitals never to score high marks again and will aim for equality. Everybody only studies a chapter of the text book and doesnt answer the questions which are irrelevant to the chapter they chose.That way everybody is guaranteed the equality of marks and standings in exams. Everyone will get a place in university and teachers will be proud for the achievements of their students. Then maybe everyone will see how pointless exams are.  Anyways, if i get high marks then i should sit in front of the computer more and if i get low marks, i should hit the books more often.  By the way, I think you are stupid.

      Roti canai. I haven't eaten a single one since the 16th of January, the day before I came here. The Malaysian restaurants here are too expensive. AUS$3.00 for a roti canai and thats the same price for a teh tarik. Crazy people. Should burn down their shops and collect the ashes in one heap and piss on them. Can't they make a suitable price for Malaysian students. Should implement memberships for student discount cards or buy 1 free 3 roti canai coupons. If i don't get roti canai soon i will go into "destruct" mode and destroy anything on sight. Mail boxes, cars, telephone booths, trees, dogs, you name it, I will destroy it.Have to control my self from going into "destruct" mode for a few more months then when i finally get to go home i will eat all the roti canai i can get.Muahahha. Tremble in fear Restoran Sri Murni, my return is at hand.

      My adventures have got made me meet many people. Some are down right purposeless and some are champions. One of the champions i have met is an African guy, Matiu. He is here in Perth studing architecture at uni.I asked him once how uni life is like and he told me that architecure is horrible. Lectures only last for an hour each day (starts at 8.00am) but you will stay and do work at uni until around 6.00 pm. This guy also seems to know a lot about Malaysia and it turns out that he used to live there. Wierd guy.He told me and my friends that once, he tricked one of those Malaysian cops on the highway. He was caught speeding and the cop made him pull over. As we all know, it takes very little to get some Malaysian cops to "forget" about your driving offence. This specimen was asking for some cash but since it was a highway he decided to give Matiu his book i which he keeps his bookings. Now this Matiu is a smart guy. He took the book, opened his wallet took out a 50 ringgit note . The not so clever cop looked around to see if anyone was looking and Matiu took advantage of the situation and slid a 1 ringgit note instead of the 50 ringgit note inside the book. The cop took the book and got on his motorcycle and drove off. I can imagine the look on the cops face when he found out he got tricked.Probably could only buy a "roti canai" for lunch. HAHAHA.  I'll blog more about the champions i have met next time i feel like it or when i am too free and have nothing better to do.

      Does anybody out there like doing laundry?? Well i hate it. Laundry is :  1. A big waste of time. Time is money and the time spent doing laundry should be spent on brainstorming ways to conquer the world or become the richest man in this side of the solar system.(if you dont know what the solar system is then i suggest you tie juicy pieces of steaks to yourself and jump into a lion exhibit druing lunch hour at your local zoo!!)  2. It is inefficeint because after doing your laundry you have the tedious tasks of hanging your clothes out to dry and doing ironing, folding and storing them. More time wasted on pointless tasks.  Someone out there should invent clothes which are water proof, stain proof, stench proof, tear proof, bullet proof, air proof, moss proof, cat proof, and so on and so on(make sure they are not human proof if not we cannot wear them =P), you get the idea.I would have done this earlier but my superior intelledt is being called by more pressing issues ( doing homework- stupid college).

      Yes, the telemarketer(my enemy) has made a big mistake. He called the same house twice. Muahahha. I'm staying in a homestay so he called my hosts- B and C. Hehehe C picked up the phone and asked for his name. And his name is OSCAR. He is also an Indian and he made the mistake of calling this house twice. Then B taught me some tactics on how to defeat those persistent telemarketers.  Telemarketer:  Hello, how are you sir??  Person:       I'm fine. How is the weather in Mumbai?? (due to his Indian accent)  Telemarketer- says nothing and puts down the phone.  Maybe my way would be more fun. Pick up the phone and wait for the telemarketer to start talking in english then reply "No hablo englais" (which is spanish or portugese for i dont understand english- i forgot which language =P). If he happens to find someone to converse with you in that language you then reply "Sorry i don't understand what you are blabbering about. I only speak english."  So the next time he annoys me, I will guarantee i will win this time. You hear that,don't you?? Youre going down.

           Don't you just hate it when you are chatting with people who like to use wierd word hich they think are homonyms with other words when it is not. It make my eyes sore just by looking at the chat window.       For example "what" and "wurt". Now tell me what in the mighty and magnificent world is classy about that. First of all wurt sounds nothing like what, so it make it look as if you are using a whole different word with a whole different meaning. Secondly, "what" and "wurt" both have the same amount of letters. So why is it so hard to type "what". Even the positioning of the letters on the keyboard makes it easier to type "what" if compared to "wurt"!!       Next example. "Was" and "wuz". They may sound the same and they still have the same amount of letters but like i said earlier why is it so hard to type "was" then. Secondly if you would care to take a look on the keyboard you will notice that the word "was" comprimises of the letters "w", "a" and "s" where as the word "wuz" comprimises of the letters "w", "u", and "z". By looking at your keyboard you can see that the three letters that form the word "was" are located so closely together where as it is the other way around for the word "wuz".      I do not understand why people like to do this. Full sentences baffle me because i have to try and pronounce each word to find out what the person is really trying to say.I am not saying you shouldn't use short forms but what i am saying is don't use useless "short forms". Use words which can be easily understood and which can be efficiently typed.
