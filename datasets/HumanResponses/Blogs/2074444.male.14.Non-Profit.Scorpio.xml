      I hurried to Geography, and sat through another boring lesson. After class I told Corey about my dream. He said, and I quote: "It was a strange dream. Big deal. I have strange dreams every night." And that was that. After school I went home and neglected to do my math homework (once again). I was bored, so I decided to draw something. After I sat there for a while, I decided I didn't really know what I wanted to draw. So I went to the library. ... Back to reality. First, news about my wallet. I'm very scatterbrained. I have a memory like one of those things that hold solid objects in while letting water flow through. Turns out my wallet was on the dresser. -_-". I exasperate myself. I slept over at Jayce's house with John and Corey. There was a bunch of misunderstandings about whether or not I could actually sleep over. To make a long story short, I had to ride my bike back and forth between my house and his over and over (and it's not a short trip). And forgot to call my mom twice, even though I had "call" written on my hand. We had a convo with Bobstubesocks, in which Jayce was typing random things he heard us saying. It is funny. I got part of it on tape. I'll be listining to it later to see if there's anything worth porting to the computer. The only game we really played was FF CC (Corey felt he had to constantly insult it until we stopped playing, but when I woke up, he was playing it) and convinced John to buy it. We watched flash movies, but Jayce didn't watch the ones Corey and I wanted to see, because of that reason. The next morning I went home and messed up my internal clock by sleeping. So I played Magician some (a NES game no one has ever heard of) for a while.

      My alarm went off. The dream was reoccurring. I had no idea what it ment. It seemed to me that it was just a weird, cliche dream. The only thing that interested me was the  weapon . I had no idea what it was! Oh well. Off to school. *skip to sixth hour* Spanish. A class with a perfect combination for tempature and time of day to put me asleep. I yawned...  A boy with black hair, about my age, and a boy with a bandanna were walking in a library. They were saying things, but I couldn't make them out. They went off is opposite directions.  The bell rung. I looked up and realised I had fallen asleep again. ... Back to reality. Yesterday I went over to Corey's lake. AND FORGOT MY WALLET! Which sucks, because my yearbook receipt is in it and I need that thing on the last day of school, or else I have to pay $20 for a yearbook! There is also $15 in it, but right now that's seeming kind of minor. While I was there we went canoing. Apparently Corey wanted to show me something. But we ended up going straight across the lake and beaching. From there we progressed to name the other side "Sexist Isle" and ransacked a village (which consisted of me grabbing a chair, twirling it around, and throwing it about three feet into the water). We then made our hasty escape. The only thing I have to do in school tomarrow is the math final test. That's all. And the next day is signing yearbooks. And since we're just going to mess around in class, I'm probably going to get pretty sick of talking to Corey (I have him in four out of seven).

      "You'll never defeat me!" "I'd like to see that theory in action." He ran at me, sword raised. I instinctively raised my weapon. He brought his sword down apon it. Time froze. I seemed to see the sword flare up with fire. My weapon snapped. The sword came down, and I was helpless. I fell to the ground, my side bleeding heavily. He laughed. "So this is the warrior that was supposed to be my doom!" "Do not judge me so hastily." I muttered. "I will spare you for now. But if you try me again, I will kill you." I looked him in the eyes, and we both knew that I would fight him again. He walked away and left me there. ... Back to reality. Well, stuff has sure been going on. Yup. You bet-cha. Corey got contacts. I gave my english speech about why you should say "soda" instead of "pop". It seemed like it was a hit. Corey said it was great. So I'm in teh happys. My mom saw a thing in the paper about flash, and now she's like "We're getting flash!" And I'm like: "Sw33t!" And then I had to explain what the 3's were.-_-"  And that's pretty much it.

      Once apon a time, Tom's friend Corey found out about this weird thing called "Xanga" (which should be spelled Zenga) and got him to join it. But soon Tom was bored of Xanga. But help was on the way! Tom was already using Blogger to do news for his webcomic (he got the idea from RPGWorld), and his other friend was talking about starting a blog with an internet friend. So Tom got a great idea! Use Blogger instead of the evil Xanga! So Tom did just that, and created a blog to tell the world about his amazing adventures in Moorhead-land.  And thus, this site came into existance.  To Be Continued...

      I'm starting to move tomarrow. Unless Jayce reads this, I really don't think he's going to find out that I'm moving until I'm done -_-" I finished Love Hina today. Note that I still haven't completely read the entire series because I missed most of the first ones. I've read 2, and 9-14. I might've read 8, but I'm not sure. I must say that the "real" ending is very good, the epiloge is done near-perfectly, and the second ending is also very good. I must say this is probably the best Manga I have ever read. In other news, I've ported almost all my comics to Drunk Duck. Hell, if Murphy can end up with #3, I think I should be able to get something. I'm probably not going to move completely, just try and draw some attention with DD. I saw Garfeild. It's good, especially if you like the comic. Most of the humour is like that in the comics. A few things I don't like: 1. Garfield's voice. For the most part, it's good. But in some places I didn't like it. Why couldn't they have gotten the person who did the voice for the T.V. show? 2. Nermal. They changed him! Gah! He's not supposed to be this stupid cat. He's supposed to be the cutest kitten in the world! I don't like the way that they went and computer animated Garfield, then went and used real cats/dogs for the rest of the charicters. 3. They broke one of the general rules of Garfield. Jon  never  gets Liz! Ever ever ever ever ever! Anyway, I think it was a good movie in general if you liked the strip. "And it's the final irony! The mailman! You're so stupid!" I might be goin' down to Corey's for a few days, but he hurt his foot so that puts a hindrence on the running around type of stuff we can do. And it might give me an excuse for getting Four Swords Adventure, which my mom won't let me spend my money on -_-" Turns out she's not agesnt video games in general. Just good ones. She specifically said that I could buy something like Pac Man or Space Invaders because they aren't 'addictive'. I resisted telling her that they don't make those games for GCN -_-"

      Wee. Tomarrow I get up bright and early for computer camp. Gettin' a ride with Jayce's mom, I am. Gotta go find my gameboy games, I do. I'm going to the Sr. High camp instead of the Jr. High (like I'm supposed to), but it should be okay. Anyway, I'm hoping the tension between us is gone. I'm not sure, because he's got me blocked on MSN. Not like I talk to him that much anyway. Unfortunetly, we're the only ones going to camp. Origanally, Corey, John, and Richard were also gonna go, but now they're not. *sigh* This should be fun. See you on friday. ~Tom~

      I've finished  Wizard and Glass , though in doing so I stayed up till 5:00am last night, woke up at noon, then read till 5:00pm. And now I've started on  Wolves of the Calla . It's good so far. In other news, friend Jayce and his friend Cheesemold (known also as Conny) got their blogger started up (see first post for more on this). I'll post a link later, because I'm too lazy to look for the URL right now. I've been making flash movies. Yup, sure have been. I've also been trying to find the bugs in my html for my front page at ACDF. I found them, and fixed them, but for some reason Keenspace isn't updating it. Oh well. Not much I can do about it. I rented Splinter Cell. And let me tell you, it is so much harder when you're not allowed to kill anyone. SOOO MUCH HARDER! On a side not, I really enjoy using diversion camaras. The hobby shop down the block from me is closing, which makes me sad. I don't really go there much, but it makes me sad none the less. Of course, I heard that they're not gonna close till they've sold everything, and that might be a month or longer. So I'll probably be moved by then. I'm moving, by the way. And I'm not happy about it, either. I guess I'll be closer to the high school, but that's a small consolation. Computer camp is coming up, and I can't wait. That's about it for now. -Tom

      I haven't posted for a while, but I have a good reason. I just got Flash! Finally! So I'm spending most of my time doing that. I should have a movie or two that I'm ready to put up sooner or later. Also, Four Swords Adventure is out! Woo! But I'm not doing the normal average regular going to the store to get it. No, I'm doing a special offer where I get a signed T-shirt, the game, the guide, and a year of Nintendo Power for just $69.99! Assuming I can somehow convince my mom to write the check out for me -_-" I did get a bike (it was $3 ^.^), though, so it should be okay. And that's all.

      Woo! School is out! Yeah! And next year… HIGHSCHOOL! I'm so excited.  I spent a long time at the library reading stuff. Mostly The Waste Lands, but I also read Yu-Yu Hakusho (or however it's spelled) vol. 1 and a Pokémon Adventures book. Now, I know Pokémon has a really bad rap. Personally, I can't stand the games anymore. The first on was good! It really was. The second one was okay. The advancements in the menu system helped a lot. Now, I haven't played the newest ones, but I have seen the actual Pokémon in the game. And it was one of the most horrifying things I have ever seen. Now, there are a few pokémon comics out there. There's the origanal "Electric Tales of Pikachu", which is pretty good. I'm thinking that the game was actually based on this comic (though I may be wrong). Then there's Pokémon Adventures. MUCH BETTER! If the games were like this, they'd be a lot more popular. Mostly, I've only had the option to read the second part (Yellow Cabarillo(sp?)) And I have to say it's excellent.  I got a haircut. That's pretty amazing, because my hair was so long, the curl made it become a fro. And now it's short again. I don't recognize myself, and whenever I see my shadow I can't help but think  Who's behind me? Wait! That's my shadow!   Anyway, that's about it. And I'm not sure if I'm gonna do anymore of the story thingys any more, namely because they suck. I'm taking it for a RPG game that I want to make, but games don't really go into storys or movies.

      lol, I like that phrase. Before I say anything else, I have to talk about this. Riley is a kid at my school. I won't call him a prep (just to avoid confrontation), but he's basically my worst enemy. At one point in Tech Ed he was moved up near me, and every class all he would do is sit there and insult me. The saddest thing is that he would insult the stupidest things. I mean, if your going to insult somebody, use your imagination! And then when I look on his Xanga, all he talks about is how mean everybody is and stuff (angsty ramblings). And then all his friends are like: "OMFG! Don't be sad, I love you!". And nearly every entry is like that. Christ, if I had people support me like that, I wouldn't be complaining about the one or two people who insulted me! -_-" *sigh* Anyway, just thought I'd say that.  The last day of school is coming up. Woo. I'm getting a year book, but first I gotta find a green marker. I'll work on that. Meanwhile, you can just sit there. I want to try and get something together with my friends. Some sort of sleepover or something. I dunno. I'll have to sort it out.  I bought Crazy Taxi. Seriously, if people drove like you do in this game, things would happen. I want a magical, indestructible Cab. In the game, not only do you suffer multiple crashes with various objects, but you can drive underwater for an unlimited amount of time, and you can topple semis with your tiny convertable. Strange. But hey, if we tried to apply the laws of physics and normality to most video games, we would find problems with everything.  Yesterday we (me and mom) were planing on going to my grandma's. On the way, we pulled into DQ so that I could get something to eat. My mom fell asleep. After a while, she woke up, and we continued. She was still tired, so we pulled into another parking lot and she slept some more. After an hour or so, she woke up. It was raining hard by then, so we decided not to go to the lake. So that plan really didn't work.  (geez, look at me go on and on) In English we got a bunch of stuff back. In history I got my time capsule(sp?). I got 198/200 ^.^. I did a lot better than I thought I would. I figured I would lose a ton of points on my labels for not filling the whole thing in.  And that's all (whew)

      sunburn! Ouch! Fun little incident today. Yesterday Corey slept over and we went swiming and went to Mean Girls. I got a sunburn while we were swimming. The next day we went to I, Robot. Now, in this theater, there is an arcade in a seperate room just off the lobby. After the movie, my mom was gonna pick us up. So we go and wait for a few minutes, and then decided to go into the arcade. We figured she'd know about the arcade and be able to find us. Turns out she didn't. We ended up waiting the whole afternoon in the theater lobby until we finally just took the bus home. =P  I, Robot is a good movie, based on the three rules of robotics (as stated in Bicentenial(sp?) Man). Will Smith plays Agent Spooner (he doesn't have any spoonerisms in the movie, unfortunently.), a cyborg detective that hates robots. He investigates an apparent suicide (of the co-founder of USR, the company that makes the NS-5 bots) that puts him on a clue trail that said scientist left for him and eventually with the help of the scientist that "makes robots seem more human" and the deceased scientist's robot, he ends up stopping a robot revolution lead by the USR main frame, Viki. I have pretty much one thing to say. It's good, but cliche. I agree with Jayce when he said that it basically rips from all the other movies where we make robots and they turn agenst us. That is pretty overdone, but that's not enough of a reason to not watch this one.  In other news, my move is coming pretty good. My room is all but complete, needing only a PC (God willing) to finish it off. Corey helped us move the couch and Mom's bed over. Only big thing left to move is the T.V. (I think). So if anyone has a good PC or the world's smallest computer desk that they're selling, tell me.

      Okay, so it might not be live by the time you actually read this, but I am posting from the library. Slept over at Josh's last night, that was fun. We watched Pirates of the Caribbean. I must say, that movie is Roxxoring. Johnny Depp does an excellent job as Jack Sparrow. I love the way he's first (okay, maybe not first) seen in the movie, walking directly off his ship's crow nest onto the dock. Classic! Josh also has a lot of Shonen Jumps at his house, so I was reading through them. Mostly Sand Land, Shaman King, and Yu-Gi-Oh. I already read most of the Naruto's they've got in S.J. Yeah, we've started moving, and my room's almost done. I must say, it's pretty cool. Kool. With a 'K'. It's really small, so my mom had a great idea: let's get a bunk bed but take out the bottom bunk! So I've got my bed floating about my T.V., GCN, and bookshelf. On the other side (when I finally get my PC -_-") we're gonna find the worlds smallest computer desk to fit in there. That's about it.
