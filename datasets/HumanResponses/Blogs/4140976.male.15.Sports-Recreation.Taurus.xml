      The Baltimore Ravens are extremely close to the Super Bowl now. They are only 6 months away now. Many of the players are very excited for the upcoming season. RB Lewis hopes to break the season rushing record, eyes 2500 yards. The other Lewis is hoping he will be able to get 300 tackles this year so he can set his own record. However the Steelers are still doubting the Ravens' chances. They just don't think they can do it. "We are the best," said Steeler coach Bill Coward. But the Ravens know this is not the case. They have even thought about signing female players to go against the Steelers when they play them. Another team that does not believe the Ravens can do it is the Philidelphia Eagles. They believe they will go all the way this year. Well the Eagles are good, I'll say that much, and we all know that. They are probably the best regular season team in the NFL. But you don't win Superbowls by going 13-3. You win Superbowls by winning the NFC championship. So the Ravens only real threat is the Patriots, but even they can't stand up to the Ravens. The Ravens just are invincible.

      Today the Ravens are hard at work in training camp, deciding who will be on the team for this year's magical Super Bowl Run. If there is any doubt in the Ravens being champions, it is from the Steelers. LB Joey Porter said, "The Ravens have no chance." Where he gets that idea I don't know, because the Ravens have the best team in the NFL. They have the best running game, best defense, and on opposite day the best passing attack. So no one can stop them.

      When asked yesterday by reporter Ron Burgundy, JD Ironmonger was questioning his ability to play soccer, including the position of goalkeeper, his specialty. However, that all changed today when the Ironman was keeper for basically the whole time in a full field scrimmage today. Coach Bret Weaver had this to say to him, "I'm looking for you to be varsity keeper. You're the best goalie I've ever seen." JD got his confidence back by actually trying and just having fun, both for the first time this season. "I'm ready to win a state championship," JD said afterwards.

      As you all may well know, there are two teams for soccer. Varsity and J.V. But which would you rather be on? You don't have a choice, but if you did, which would it be? When asked, Matt Copeland said, "JV because I would get more playing time." However, Tim Bartsch said, "I would like to be on varsity because it's better." So as you can see, JV can be more enjoyable, but varsity will make you a better player. Me personally, I would prefer varsity because of bragging rights. But hey. I have to prove myself first.

      The tryouts went smoothly for many of the soccer hopefuls. I myself did not make 14:30(yet, although for myself I got a good time), but many of the freshmwomen did great. As long as I am on varsity, this can only be good, since the freshwomen will be on JV. Now there were many surprises during the 2 mile run. Michael Hofmeister schooled everyone in the run as usual, but there were many other good times. Littly got 14 flat, a great time for a JV backup last year, and like I said, many unknown freshwomen surprisingly made the cut. One person who I think did good though missing the cut was Tall Tim. He usually doesn't get such good times, but yesterday he really turned it on and tomorrow I really believe there is a chance he will have a breakthrough and make the cut. However, there were some disappointing times, and oddly theu were by some of the good players. Dougie didn't make the cut and if he can just do 14:30, he is a sure spot on varsity because of his defending ability. Some hopefuls yet to run are Willy(Scottie) Johnson and Colin. I speculate both of them to have an impact on the team this year. Scottie is dangerous up front and Colin can play many different positions.

      The soccer season is now only 6 days away after today. Of course I can run a 6 minute 2 miles, so I should have no trouble, but the other people who can't are in danger of getting cut. So I plan to make varsity goalie and easily beat out Colin Crowe. I mean he has no game whatsoever. Robert Maloney could beat him out. Just kidding. Colin will be tough to beat, but all of my training over the summer hopefully will be enough to do the job.

      The Great Mills Hornets have tryouts on August 14. That is only a week away and everyone is in hot pursuit of making the team. Many players are looking to make the varsity squad. This is to establish themselves as good players, and possibly because the J.V. Team's situation is in disarray. Head Coach Frank Peck was shipped out to Iraq where he will find Osama Bin Laden. So as you can see there is no coach. This really sucks. So we will wait and see what happens.
