      What can i say 6 months have passed since i started the journey in Catholic junior college. THere have been both ups and downs that brought both laughter and tears. The first 3 months was a haven of fun, everyone seemed so carefree in those early days. I actually looked foward to going to school. Fast foward to now, things are so different nowadays. Stress has overtaken a lot of pple. The class is filled with animosity and misunderstandings. Maybe its just me but i can sense the uneasyness surrounding pple nowadays.   The past month was particularily hard when i found out some pple are hiding their true intentions. ALl i can say is , LET BYGONES BE BYGONES, why continue with this hate and distrust!!I sincerely apologise for whatever missunderstandings caused   Oh well, now its the holidays and its just my luck to be struck with a rather serious illness( herpes affecting my right eye, my face looks like a warzone with spots covering 1/4 of my face  sob sob... :X)last thursday just before my GP exam. HOW SUAY CAN ONE GET!!!!!!!!!!ARgh Had to miss the class bbq, spent most of the time lying in bed or watching tv now. Must recover faster, hope to be well by wednesday.  GOt to go, TATa

      its wednesday now and i just finished all of the papers except for chinese, todays one the maths was probably the worst.........i think the best i can get is an AO pass...if theres a miracle, i'll get an A level pass. ARgh history and econs were slightly better , my revision was half baked, couldnt realli concentrate..still some was better than nothing.  Right now i am feeling so weird, its like i see pple that i noe, but i dun have the guts to talk to them, this is especially when i am in class, i dun seem to be talking to my classmates as often as i used to ..SOme of them, i havent spoke a word to in like a few months...BLAR I MUST GET rid of this habit of mine. DIE!!!!!!!!!! I must not let shyness overcome me, or fear or whatever $%^&% that stops me from socialising.  oh on sunday got lawn bowls competition, didnt do very well against the old pple who were super pro, in addition, got sunburn on my nose again as i was under the sun from morning to about 430 in the afternoon.  Now i shall think of ways to be more open to other ppl TATA!

      Lets c its thursday nite and just bout slightly more than 40 hours till history paper. The past 4 days were spent mostly at home studying,stoning, slacking, procastinating, ocassionally go out for lunch.Lets see on wednesday had delicious roti prata!! near Nus that shop,erm cant remember the name. YUMMY that was like the first time i had prata since mid march. Value for money too ^-^. Oh and my comp is getting on my nerves with all the popups and lagginess due to the virus in the comp that cant be removed. Still searching for the last box set for gundam seed, cant wait to get it and finish off this fantastic series. YOu've got to watch it if u got the time.Attempts to dload it via kazaa is frustatingly slow.... tortourous is a more accurate word. Someone teach me how to use bit torrent, i'm a noobie at using bt. Ok thats all i am thinking so far, other than how to handle that dreaded hist paper.

      Hm the weekend has already gone by ultra quick and i am lagging behind in my studies.As i am typing this, my fingers are shivering.... must be the pre-exam stressness.ARGH the thought of not doing well is always somewhere in my brain. I must EXCORCISE IT BE gone once and for all.I must believe that i can do it. anywayz on Sat i went to the hope of god church at the invitation of Freedy, one of Jansen's friend to have lunch and then attend praise and worship. It was fun alrite, with some clips of american idol uncensored, all the bloopers etc..( william hung.. hehe) What the pastor said was truly meaning, if one doesnt have any weaknesses, that person will be too proud. So weaknesses keep us humble. Anyway after service, i went to taka library to study for a while before heading home.  On sunday, went for service at city harvest church, met Amos at the entrance who showed me the way.Once again, found the service meaningful and amazed at the energy exhibited by the ppl. Saw Ho Yeow Sun, a singer who was also the pastor at that church. THere were a lot of pastors present, including the guest from malaysia and Russia.  After service, rushed back to town to meet parents for Father's day meal. Journey took ages once again, more than an hour. AFter that accompanied my dad to search for a new hp for his present.However, his plan not yet 21 months, so have to wait for another month. Phones super ex, even with trade ins...  Yup after that, went back home, took a nap, studied a bit and then slacked..

      As i pass through life, it itself is a perilious journey filled with all sorts of pple who u will meet.  Some are nice, while others are not so nice.  I dunno how to say this, but this has been bugging me for almost 2 FCUKING MONTHS CAUSING ME TORMENT.  I have to let it go ONCE AND FOR ALL.Painful memories from the months of april, may that refuse to go away no matter how hard i try to forget.  Right now i'm just wishing i could turn back time and perhaps have avoided this whole mess in the first place.  I just want to clear the misunderstanding that has occurred, this cant go on forever..  SO much pent up anger that is dying to be released has been suppressed for like almost 2 months.  I WANNA SCREAM MY HEAD OFF ARgHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHhhhhh ***%^^%$%^* .......now i can go and sleep in peace

      Ok heres an update of what basically happened in the past say 5 days. Time whizzes so fast that i cant even stop to think, as i type this dunno how mani minutes will be gone.  Monday, tuesday basically slack days. Stayed at home most of the time to laze around and force myself to study. As the house was under renovation had to go out for meals except breakfast. Studying progressing at a slow rate, i scared i cant finish my revision. Onli got about 9 days left....  Wednesday training got shifted to the afternoon which was totally unexpected, its like we were expecting it to be in the morning. ANywaz i studied in the morning, and in the afternoon went to yck mrt to meet jansen and his pals. Arrived there at about 130pm, hm his hair has changed, more funky, other than that he's as cheerful as ever.After a while met all of his friends, erm freedy,dex,jonathan,ted,rayson,alvin, james. Hm they were from diff jcs like srjc,ajc and yjc. So we proceeded to nyp to eat in their canteen, foodcourt was closed so we ate fast food. The food is cheaper than outside but tastes delicious. After that we went to the grassroot club to bowl. MAn my bowling really sucks, cannot make it. Rayson was the most pro reaching a score of about 120 pins. I got the lowest blehz.  After that we went to play table soccer, quite funny to play but expensive, cost about 50 cents for like 6 balls only..We then proceeded to the billards room where a few of us were playing billards. Me and those not playing just lazed around, later we acted like pple deprived of a childhood, by throwing balls across the table into the pockets to c who was the most accurate. Lolx had loads of fun doing childish stuff. Finally around 520, we left the way and went our seperate ways. I must day i had an enjoyable time with them, they're pretty cool and nice pple. A big THANK YOU to JanSen, enjoyed chatting and catching up with u. STay cool man

      ok time for a quick update about what happened from last friday. Ok i got training in the morning, had to drag myself out of bed and get ready to go. Hitched a ride to plaza singapura before taking the bus to kallang down there. Urgh the sun was so hot and i was super drowxy and tired , my sunburns sustained from thursday made things worse. As ususal my lawn bowling was average, not up to par with dennis the pro and soon to be captain. He usually ends of saving our team when i screw something up. Anyway training ended bout 12 and then i headed home. Supposed to meet my friend but then he suddenly got extra lessons ( acjc). So i just stoned around at home and watched somemore gundam. I really love that show, craving for more episodes   SATURDAY woke up about 10 in the morning.Had to see the eye specialist for a follow up checkup. Went there around 11, even though appointment was at 10. But based on previous experience, i always had to wait, so i thought if i came later= wait less. WRONG! ended up waiting for close to an hour before i spent less than 4 min with the doc. He sayz i am fine just that must come back again in 3 weeks time.  In the afternoon, the same person who i was supposed to meet up again couldnt make it as he was ill. Went home and played the comp for a while, also read the teens magazine i bought. At 430, went with family to funan centre to have an eye checkup and to arrange for my new specs. spent a super long time there as all memebers of my family had to have their eyes checked. My father tried to bargain for a cheaper price, in the end the bill was over 1k dollars.... We had dinner at the foodcourt before leaving around 1940.  Alrite SUNDAY, woke up early around 815, then ate breakfast and my mum sent me to queentown mrt station. Then i went to boon lay station and waited for jing xuan to come. She asked me to come and attend her church service, which is christian, i am a catholic by the way. Well i didnt mind going, wanted to see how a "praise and worship" session was like. So like we boared the shuttlebus, which i stupidly tapped my ezlink card and reached the church which looked super mordern.   WOW ! the moment i stepped in that church ( city harvest) i was impressed, it had lifts and the reception area itself was impressive. The session was held in a auditorum in the basement level 3 and 4. Ok it was huge and the scene was like more for a concert or something. The session kicked off with crowds of pple singing their lungs out and pple jumping for joy praising the lord. I was stunned, this is totally different from the quiet and orderly routine of mass. Here the place was so full of energy and vibrance. The pple are so passionate about singing praises to god. Looking at jing xuan and the other pple singing so deeply and passionately was an eye opener. The music was emplified by some gizmos that are used for concerts. The band played rockish tunes that praised and glorified god.   After that their pastor gave a speech and then invited the guest who was a pastor from Russia who has noble blood. Yeah he was a speaker who roused the attention of everyone, there wasnt a boring moment.He told the pple that i was their duty to go and spread the word's lord and everyone should go for a mission trip or something. Then he asked those who wanted to do something for the lord, and hordes of pple went down, including jing xuan to be blessed by the pastor. A shocking scene for me was went he ran around touching pple's foreheads and they seemingly passed out and fell to the ground. Ok went the service was over, we went to the rooftop for some debriefing. After that i thanked her for this rare insight and she showed me the way back to the bus-stop before i caught 242 back to boonlay station.   Then i took a looooooooooonng trip back to orchard station to meet my classmates for project work. Arrived in town at about 135 and bought some sushi for 510 dollars for my lunch. Talk bout expensive food. The project work meeting around 3 oclock. We shared the delicious fries at the library at orchard. After that i went to meet my family at macs at shaw house basement. Grabbed a quick bite at macs and chatted for a while. Went to borders to kill time. At 1730 went back to lido to watch "breaking news" a chinese movie with my family. Hm pretty short and medicore in my opinion.   After that, i rushed to cineleisure to meet my friend benedict to watch "day after tommorrow" Wow that show was awesome in terms of special effects, the twisters and the snow.Makes me wonder that such an event can actually happen in the future if nothing is done to save the environment. Hm maybe i use less aircon... Finally got home close to 2200 to grab some noodles as dinner.

      Ok when i was watching harry potter on wed i got an unexpected sms from jing xuan. My first 3 months classmates whose very sporty and tall. She asked us ( my former class T9) whether we could join her and her church group at sentosa for an outing. at first i couldnt decide whether to go as firstly i doubted that i could get up early enough the next day, my movie ended at midnite and i got home around 0040. we were supposed to meet up at 9 the next day at harbour front. Secondly i dun really noe her church group. In the end i just decided to go, it was an oppurtunity for me to catch up a bit with her and get to see her church group  So i woke rather early and hitched a ride on my parents car to reach dhoby ghuat interchange before taking the train to harbour front.There i saw a lot of ppl waiting, after waiting for a while jing xuan came and introduced me to some of her church friends, who incidentally were the pple gathered at the station. I then realised i was the only one besides her who was from T9.   I met a couple of pple who were all in jx's church group, most of them were in jc's with a few adult leaders i think. The group proceeded to sentosa where the station games started . I was in jing xuan's group together with her fellow track mate jieyun, nayun a tall and muscular acjcian basketballer and yong ming also from acjc. They were friendly and sociable and didnt mind my presence as an outsider. The first game played was the treasure hunt, we scoured all over the beach for items. However the coconut we got got eaten be the other pple. The second game was hydration, basically each group had to finish 7 cans of soft drinks. Our group had only 5 pple but we drank really quickly. Lolx after that we were all like so stuffed with gas  Next was a  game where after burying jing xuan in the sand,i and nayun swam across the little strait to an island and had to guess what they were saying, they drew the letters using their ahem bottoms. I didnt realise they were trying to spell my name. -embarrased-  After lunch i met a guy named amoz whose from catholic high, wow he sure can make ppl laugh, his jokes are lame but funny. We played games like dog and bone and beach volleyball. After that, jingxuan suggested to ride the monorail and we agreed to do so. It was a long ride but we entertained ourselves by talking cock among ourselves and doing lame stuff. Amoz was like the entertainer on board.That was the first time in dunno how many years i rode the monorail. We stopped by bk at the ferry terminal for a quick bite.  Later we got back to the beach just in time for the beautiful sunset. It was really nice to see the sun melt over the horizon. We finally left sentosa at around 1930. I got to really thank jing xuan for this oppurtunity to attend to this outing. She said the outing would be fun and it sure is. It sort of gave me an insight what her church group was like.

      Ah it has been a rather hectic pass 2 days. On wed i was stoning around at home watching another box of gundam seed that i just bought yesterday. watched finished it again and yearned for some more. Yup i think i am addicted to that anime now. I realised that lawn bowls training was shifted to the morning and i woke up at 10 way past the starting time. Drat i thought it was in the afternoon at the usual time.I gotta train more often, got a competition coming up in like one month, so i must make sure i go on friday morning.   In the nite, i went to plaza singapura to have dinner with my mom, after that i met my old friend joel for a movie. before that we were basically toking cock and roaming round the place. Passed by the arcade and saw some girls doing the para para dance, hm pretty nice music i must say. Harry potter is a nice show, although i didnt watch the first 2 films , i still found it enjoyable and quite intriging. Now i noe why so many pple absoulutely dig this show and read the books. hm by the time the show finished it was midnite and we had to rush to catcth the last mrt train back home. I reached a deserted orchard road at 0020 to find that the last 174 had left already... In the end i still managed to get home. i shall talk about thursday another time

      hm yesterday went back to sji to collect O level cert, hm so silly have to wait for 6 months after the new year before u can get it. I couldnt contact my friend who suddenly seemed to have dissappeared, calling his phone and his house got no reply... oh well, anyway saw some of the scouts having a debrief after camp, kind of reminds me of my younger days. Time really passes so fast whether u like it or not, maybe when i grow up i will invent a time machine or something.  Oh yeah i found out that some simple msgs can have a lot of meaning, in a positive sense that is, it allows u to keep in contact with some ppl who are in other schools and lets u noe how they are doing. The power of words can really make a difference, kind words bring joy to ones soul while hurtful words bring sorrow. Oh yeah i tried to do some excercise in the evening, man i sure need to excercise more regurlarily, jogging for a while makes me tired already..  Thats all my mind can think of for now

Hm tomolo going back to sji to collect the ORdinary cert, hope to meet up with some of my ex-classmates, havent seen some of them in ages,,, i wanna catch a few film too

      hm finally went back to school today for hist lect, pretty boring i must say. The teacher thinks he is being funny with all that jokes but some of them are really substandard i must say. I missed out the maths on mon and tues, my brain still gets pretty tired easily, cant really say i am back at full strength.Got to watch my health. cant let it deteriorate again. The feeling of lying in bed again makes me shiver. Well spent the day watching anime gundam seed and playing some wc3 and cs. Its been a while since i played wc3, still as fun as ever.Yup games are fun but playing for too long can be bad for your health so i gotta restrain myself, i dun wanna collaspe and die. It has happened to other unfortunate pple before.   Still got a lot of things in my mind. I gotta learn to relax and let go off these annoying tensions within me.Its not worth getting so stressed out over trivial things

      Alrite another week has whizzed by and things are gonna get super hectic..the mood in class is generally ok with the ocassional outbursts of anger by pple who cant control anger. In my opinion controlling anger is THE HARDEST THING IN THIS WORLD. ITs temping to release all that frustration by lashing out at someone, u feel better but at what cost. NO i am not talking about anyone in particular, i do not want any more misunderstandings other than the one that occured like 4 months ago..and still isnt resolved yet...sigh. I keep thinking to myself that being angry only breeds hatred.HATRED IS THE ROOT OF EVIl, u keep on thinking on destructive thoughts, u cant concentrate on things that u want to do. SOrry if i sound so cynical, but with all the things happening around me, i find it increasingly hard to suppress my anger....sometimes it just DYING TO BURST OUT, but i do not want that happen..it will not be pretty  Alrite enough about all the unhappy stuff, last sat watched i robot with my good pal, a person who i can freely share my thoughts with. The movie itself was pretty cool, effects were nice.... i like the car..so cool. Makes you think about the future where robots can control the world. Sunday its off to do project work once again..bleahz project work is really a pain in the butt.  From mon to tuesday,every nite was burnt doing project work, typing out the minutes, getting the gannt chart done. IN the process my hw backlog piled up, i felt like crap in school, always so tired. It was a hectic rush for everyone to get the file ready for submission, and i mean really rush, lol doing last minute stuff sure aint nice. When the file was finally submitted i was reliefed.  Wednesday, had learning journey after school went to junction 8 where the class split off to different places to eat. I was at pasta mania with the dc, justina, junjie and a friend of brendan, a female cadet inspector. Didnt had enough cash so i headed over to yoshinoya for a students meal,yup cheap and appetising. For the learning journey, was at CPF building where we had talks and watched a video clip, pretty boring in my opinion.  Thursday was the only day i got home early, wanted to do some work but ended up slacking around. Was snoozing on and off, due to a lack of sleep accumulated over the days.  Yesterday was a better day.After school i went to town with some of my cca mates ivan and andy, to have fun, playing lan games that is. ITs been a long time since i went to a lan shop to play, had macs befored that. Boy was it fun, those few hours spent playing helped me to destress and forget my troubles for a while. I didnt noe cs(counter-strike) could still be so fun after all these years. After that went back to watch some gundam seed again, yes i cant get enough of it, the story is so fantastic. Alrite till next time peeps

      ok havent blogged for a very long time like almost a week, find it very hard to type when i want to. Ok last sunday had lawn bowls competition in the morning, one word describes it "disastrous", totally off form and couldnt concentrate. Boy was i glad when it was finally over, aniwaes after that went to meet my folks for lunch. Went home and took a nap, super tired. Then i managed to study a bit for chinese. IN the evening went to meet my friend for dinner, ate at bk cineleisure.After that we went bowling, i finally realised that u are not supposed to throw the ball but instead roll it, thats why i bowled so lousyily in the past. Anyway had loads of fun, played 3 games and at the same time burned a hole in my pocket, finally went home around 2300.  Monday studied a bit in the morning for chinese, its like its the subject that i am least prepared for. After that in the afternoon went to meet jansen and his pals.In the process, i asked them to do so surveys for my pw. watched spiderman 2 which was super cool and fascinating. Its better than the first one in my opinion, the hero really has grown and matured. AH that ends officially the holidays, as on tuesday its back to school  Tuesday basically had chinese in the morning, my water bottle was confiscated by the teacher, was SUPER ANGRY as i was very thristy, had to bear with it for like 3 hours, Joel my classmate was unfortunate..his english chinese dictionary was confiscated.. hopefully he managed to use it before that happened. IN the afternoon had NE quiz, quite hilarious some of the questions.After that had oral exams for chinese AO, was alrite in my opinion, finally went home to catch some sleep.  From wed to thurs i was practically slacking at home after school not even touching my homework. I still feel as if it was the holidays.. argh cant believe its term already..everyday go home play comp..still trying to dload gundam seed..  Friday finally i managed to grab gundam seed after a tip off from one of my friends. THere was a council investiture and a very entertaining youth day concert..BLar after school went to town....but with no one!!!!!!! why cant i fit into a group!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I REALLY MISS THE FIRST 3 MONTHS.. oh well, the good thing was i had some quiet time to myself.

      hm going to talk about this long weekend thanks to youth day which happens like once a year. on SAt went to see the eye doc for the last time, waited for like close to 90 mins....which seemed like eternity, and went i finally saw the doc, lasted for like 3 min...ARgh make me wait for so long, was in the process of getting stoned.. After that went to macs at tanglin mall for a quick lunch.. saw a lot of crescent girls around . Then i went to holland village to meet jx and the other ppl for cell group meeting.Jx was telling me more about the holy spirit and speaking in tongues, i find it rather interesting.. hope to experience it sometime I could see that she is influenced by the holy spirit and this helps her through her problems in life.What the pastor said felt so real, it takes commitment to make things happen.. u are in a difficult situation cos god has plans for you, wants u to change your character or something.  Its probably things u havent thought of.. after all HE is ALMIGHY. After the meeting ended, i was planning to go home, but decided to follow jx with her friend jieyun to town. Hm starting from the heeren, we walked all the way to suntec city, my first time doing so on foot, along the way , we stopped by the singapore art musuem(old SJI :) and a shop selling some church stuff. Along the way, it was just chit chat and some sightseeing(churches)Dinner was at food court at suntec, at first we couldnt find it and had to ask for directions, it was shifted to another location.Hm saw chong ying and his friends, we gave our seats to them. Jing xuan then found her friend dywanne and from this point onwards, non stop bickering occurred, jieyun told me that once the two of them get together bound to quarrel. ITs very amusing actually...like watching free show, we went to macs at citilink mall where dywanne had his dinner and had to coax jx to eat some food. And the bickering continued...entertainment. After that, we went to esplanade rooftop, admiring the view.. listening to a free concert. There was some talk of some ppl getting married and who becomes the flowergirl/boy..ahem the two ppl bickering -_-"". Left the esplanade around 2200 and headed back home. Phew then its off to bed. Just something that came to my mind,treasure the ppl around you.. whether or not they like u does not matter..human life is so limited, must try to enjoy every moment.

      alrite the first time i heard this song back in may, i fell in love with it, its a catchy and ultra cool dance hit. The lyrics are perfect for cheering up those with troubles in relationships, although i am single, it could come in handy in the future...XD  Mircacle by Cascada  Boy meets girl  You were my dream, my world  But I was blind  You cheated on me from behind   So on my own  I feel so all alone  Though I know it’s true  I’m still in love with you    Refrain:   I need a miracle  I wanna be your girl  Give me a chance to see  That you are made for me  I need a miracle  Please let me be your girl  One day you’ll see it can happen to me  I need a miracle  I wanna be your girl  Give me a chance to see  That you are made for me  I need a miracle  Please let me be your girl  One day you’ll see it can happen to me  It can happen to me    Day and night  I’m always by your side  Cause I know for sure  My love is real my feelings pure  So take a try  No need to ask me why  Cause I know its true  I’m still in love with you   I need a miracle…

      hm theses are the few songs that i find so meaningful, they're really nice in my opinion. GO and check them out, i often think of these songs when i am lonely/ depressed, it helps abit to get rid of those down feelings  Everytime by britney spears  Notice me Take my hand Why are we Strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me?  Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I make believe That you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you baby  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry  Ohhhh  At night I pray That soon your face Will fade away  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you baby

      here i am rotting in front of the comp on this day 7 august 2004. Earlier i had pw meeting that was rather unproductive as one of the pple who was supposed to come didnt come and he had the pw file. So i just sat there and stoned, while the girls chatted away (One of lingzhi's friends came) In the end managed to do 2 group evaluations.  Last sat, went for scouts stepping up ceremony to see the juniors (sec 3's) take over the sec 4's role. Hm i remember exactly one year ago when i stepped down and left the scout unit, hai how fast 1 year flies by.... now theres about 2 months to promos and i still in a slacky mood. i had to leave sji at 5 and rushed off to town to meet the other lawnbowlers, we then took a bus and rode for a long rige.(45) min to our coach house for our seniors j2 farewell. Haha i ate lots of food, had fun playing tai ti, watched hellboy, saw the girls play mahjong( i have no idea how to play that) got home at about 2330.  Sunday cant really remember much, generally stayed at home to study for tests.  Monday was napha test day. Due to photo taking , our class got delayed, in the end had to continue after school.. which ended at 510 !! hm i think i did alrite this year, better than last year, hm situps 45, standing broad jump 226cm , pullups 6, shuttle run 10.1 secs, sit and reach 34 cm, 2.4 Km run 12.16 mins///overall silver i hope..  most impressive for pullups goes to..................Byron and Samuel the musclemen, they did close to 40 pullups combined. FOr shuttlerun, junjie is undisputed champ with his sliding technique and time of 9.2 seconds, 2.4 Km run champion is byron/joel all around 9.30 min  Tuesday erm cant really rememeber much, wednesday was erm careers day for j2s. J1 timetable was for all of us to take a gp test in the morning which i think i did badly and after that was another pw block period where we were more interested in getting ready for the maths retest. Had lunch and then proceeded to the lt for a 3 hour maths paper, what the heck my butt was pain after everything was over, 3 hours of torture.  Thursday came home and slept for like 3 hours in the afternoon. Managed to update cs 1,6 which took AGES and i mean AGES like a few hours, could barely do my work as a result of that.  Friday was a day of fun, starting out after school where the class went to seoul garden at bugis for lunch. The place was packed man, and the food rox.. Ate until super full, we did some crazy stuff like bbqing the orange, jelly which melted into a pile of goo, brendan my classmate actually ate one of the bbqed oranges -_-"'. Joel our htc did some ridicolous things like putting fruits like watermelon together with the raw meat. OVerall very enjoyable. After that went home for nap before heading to sji for ap. Hm this year got some very glaring faults but overall was still ok. Watching it brought back memories of me in the field marching last year. After that headed to town with two of my good buddies to play...pool not something i am good at. Hm after 8 months in jc, i have only played pool 3 times... that sort of tells u how good/lousy i am. But the place at cineleisure was a rip off at 8.80 an hour, we stayed there for 2 hours and left the place at 2245. Reached home at 2320.
