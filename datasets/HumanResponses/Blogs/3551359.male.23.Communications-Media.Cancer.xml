        For the past months I've been participating in&nbsp;a masterclass about film criticism.&nbsp;The final college of this class took place yesterday, and afterwards&nbsp;I&nbsp;had&nbsp;a nice get-together with some fellow students. We&nbsp;had dinner together and&nbsp;some of us went to a couple of bars in Grooningen.&nbsp;I&nbsp;was one of the last to leave&nbsp;the bar at 05.00 'o clock, so I got home&nbsp;pretty late.

         While searching for a birthday present for a friend of mine, I accidentally discovered that a dvd of  urlLink  Citizen Kane   (1941) has finally been released. My first screening of this movie took place fairly recently, during a college viewing in a movie theatre. I was immediately hooked by it's gloomy opening sequence. For some reason I am always a sucker for movies with a sinister atmosphere. Visually, 'Kane' is very stunning. It made a huge impression on me, so I wanted to buy it for my collection. Being a poor student, I didn't really have the money to purchase this classic. Of course I couldn't resist the temptation and so I delved into my savings to buy a copy, along with the last installment of the  Lord of the Rings  trilogy, which was also on my wishlist. This week I'll be watching 'Kane' for the second time. Hurray!

        Here's the thing, I am a movie lover, and yes, that means that I'm a little obsessed with cinema. I have a habit of spending far too much of my money on dvd's. I even have this weird dream of directing my own movie one day. Besides this, I'm also a journalist. I studied&nbsp;for becoming one&nbsp;for five years.&nbsp;During this time, I worked parttime and freelance for&nbsp;a number of newspapers. These&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;were always great fun, but after I while writing about local farmer festivals and missing cows somehow wasn't wholly satisfying for me anymore. I would like to spend more time on research before I write my stories, and that's why I chose to study some more.&nbsp;I always liked movies, and so I decided to study Arts, Culture &amp; Media in Groningen. I focus on&nbsp;film sciences and I&nbsp;hope this will give me anough basic knowledge&nbsp;and expertise to become a movie journalist or maybe a film critic one day.&nbsp;In the mean time&nbsp;I've got&nbsp;to keep writing, so on this neat little website I'll try to keep a record of all my movie experiences. Oh, and I will probably also rave about my life, now and then.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's see how long I can keep this up...

          I got tired of studying for all those tests I have next week,&nbsp;so I decided to take a pause to watch   urlLink Phone Booth   (2001). This movie couldn't have been released much later, because the cellular phone will probably have made phone boots obsolete in a year or two.  &nbsp;

        Well, this is it. As of today, the shiny world of television is a no go zone for me. Why? Because the European soccer championship has started. For one month, every TV channel will broadcast matches, hours of boring soccer related television shows and endless bickering by semi knowledgeable soccer analysts. This is not something I want&nbsp;to see.

        One more month of gruesome tests and studying and this summer's vacation is a fact. Finally! Except for a short trip to the Greek island of Crete, I haven't really been on vacation for years. No wonder I'm dying to travel abroad. A couple of weeks ago, I got this crazy idea of flying to New York. I've seen that city in hundreds of movies, and for quite some time I've been curious whether it lives up to it's reputation of exciting metropolis. Tickets never were as cheap as they are now, but because of my cash-flow problems I'm still forced to pick a travel destination closer to Holland, which means I'm going to stay in Europe.

        I just took an interesting  urlLink questionnaire  to determine which movie bad guy I resemble most. According to the test results, my personality seems to be much like that of that 'nice' guy in  urlLink  American Psycho   (2000), Norman Bates... Hmmm...

        Today's only been the second warm day of this summer, and already those high temperatures start to piss me off. I've got some important tests coming up, so I went to the university library to do some studying today. The heat in there made me feel so heavy and slow... I just couldn't concentrate on my books. I went back home early. After dinner (Thank god it was my roommate's turn to cook, I probably would not have survived the heat of a furnace) I tried watching David Lynch's   urlLink Wild at heart   (1990). Unfortunately, I totally forgot about my LCD television. Those tv's are nice and all, but they radiate so much heat that an average room feels like an oven in no time. After only fifteen minutes of  Wild at Heart  I was soaked by my own sweat and I started to melt away. Great... Later, I finished watching the movie, but I can't say that I really liked it. I don't know why, because I liked some of Lynch's other productions.  This reminds me of another miserable movie experience. For some reason, I went to the cinema to see   urlLink Pearl Harbor   (2001). What's even stranger is that&nbsp;I went to see it&nbsp;on a particulary hot day, a couple of summers ago. During the movie, wiping the sweat out of my eyes consumed much of my attention, so&nbsp;afterwards I could not&nbsp;really tell whether the movie was&nbsp;good or bad. Honestly, I thought I wouldn't leave that movie theatre alive. But despite the immense heat I couldn't get myself to leave&nbsp;before the movie ended (hey, I paid for that ticket!), so I sat out the entire three and a half hours. Afterwards I had only one word to say to the owner of that cinema: 'airco'. I guess the summer just isn't the right season for watching movies...

         This afternoon I borrowed   urlLink Lola Rennt   (1998) from a&nbsp;friend, who taped it from television. I never saw an eclectic movie like this one before. The flashing images are accompanied by ear pounding techno music and German director Tom Tykwer uses virtually every film&nbsp;technique available. Black and white, color, standard 35 mm film, video, slow motion, single frame shots, jump cutting, animated sequences... You name it, it's all in this stylish movie.   Basically,  Lola Rennt  is about a punky girl (Lola, duh...) who runs her ass off for her lover, Manni. This dimwitted guy lost a large sum of drugs money on the subway. Money he was supposed to deliver to a very nasty gangster. Needless to say that Manni nearly craps his pants in fear of the consequences. Lola's got a measly 20 minutes to find another 100.000 Deutsche Marken, and so she starts running the streets of Berlin to save her boyfriend from a painful death. The story revolves completely around these frantic 20 minutes, that are shown three times. Each time the events take place in a slightly different manner. These tiny differences have a dramatic impact on the results of Lola's actions, however.   The concept of  Lola Rennt  appears to resemble that of movies like   urlLink Sliding doors   (1998) and   urlLink Groundhog day   (1993). These are also flicks that use alternate realities to show how tiny details can change one's faith. I was entertained by  Lola Rennt , but I fastforwarded some sequences because I felt they were a little repetitive.

         urlLink Ronald Reagan , former president of the United States of America, died yesterday at the age of 93. I really don't remember much of his presidency because I was just an ignorant eight year-old when Reagan was in his second term. However, I do know that in the 50's and 60's he had roles in a large number of television shows and mediocre Warner Bros movies, mostly westerns. Besides this, he was also president of the American Screen Actors Guild. Strange that a B-actor can become leader of the most powerful nation in the world. I can't imagine any Dutch actor being elected as prime minister. But then again, Holland isn't America...

        My mother felt generous today, and because my parents will be on vacation when I turn 23, she invited me and my father to a premature celebration of my birthday. We went to a Japanese restaurant. There we got to pick the meat, fish and vegetables of our choice and with the aid of a blazing fire the cooks prepared a meal out of those ingredients. Tasty! A bit too tasty, actually...

        And what an... Erm... Sick week this has been! First of all, I've constantly been in an extremely nervous and nauseous state for reasons that I'm not going to discuss on this blog. Let's say that I tried to give fate a twist and I'm not sure yet if my actions will give me the results I hope for.  Partly because of the resulting uncertainty, I completely screwed up a test on Monday.&nbsp;Later that day I managed to poison myself and a friend of mine. We agreed she would drop by after work, and so I promised to prepare her a nice meal. The problem is that I'm not much of a cook. I'm the kind of guy that ruins even the simplest of dishes. This is probably the reason why my friend felt sick within an hour after we had finished supper. Her sickness must have been caused by the spicy chicken I made... (damn those foul, treacherous beasts!) After she'd left, my own stomach also started to feel weird (and that's an understatement). Because of this, I didn't get much sleep that night.   On Tuesday morning I felt so miserable that I couldn't get myself to go to the university for the second test of this semester. Great... Well, it was no big deal since I hadn't studied for it. I was sick for the remainder of the day and I had a terrible headache. In the evening I felt a little better, so I watched a soccer match (Holland vs Germany) at a friend's place. Normally, I am not really a soccer fan (and again, an understatement) but this time I actually enjoyed cursing and swearing (damn those Nazi's!) in front of the television. I never realized soccer could be that much fun!   After the match I went home to get some sleep. I&nbsp;had just switched of the lights when I&nbsp;was called by some other friends who asked me to join them for a drink or two (or more). Despite my uneasy stomach and my tired head, I could not resist their invitation. For some reason we ended up in a very unsettling bar, full of freshmen, fratboys and 16-year old girls. It even had a bar which rotated slowly. Usually, joints like these are not my favourite places to hang out, but hey, who cares after a couple of beers? I enjoyed myself, but I forced myself to go home at 02.30. Besides, my roommate didn't feel very well either, so I had to escort him home. Enough is enough...   Because of my enthusiastic alcohol consumption I got sick again on Wednesday... No wonder I could not get any studying done this week. I guess I will have to retry all those important exams in August. Yeah, I know I am going to regret this later, but at least I had a great time!

         I saw   urlLink Troy   (2004) last night. I enjoyed it for what it is, but I can't say that I was really impressed by this movie. Sure, the CGI armies are nicely done, the action is enjoyable and yeah, the art direction is very good, but  Troy  has many flaws, of which I will describe the ones that annoyed me the most.   What disappointed me most were the massive battle scenes. A couple of years ago, battles like the ones in  Troy  would have been received enthusiastically. But after  The Lord of the Rings  trilogy, it's hard to impress people with the image of thousands of marching soldiers alone. The direction and choreography have to be much better than that of director Wolfgang Petersen. Obviously, it was his goal to show us the grandness of the Trojan war, and so every battle starts with long shots of the opposing parties. But when the clash finally begins, Petersen cuts to close ups of individual soldiers too often. Personally, I think this is a bad choice. Those close ups may give a chaotic sense to the spectacle, but together with the rapid editing, they made me forget about the massive scope of the battles entirely. There is only one fight that I really liked. The clash between Hector and Achilles is the best duel I have ever seen in a movie. Here Petersen doesn't use close ups and fast cutting, so you can see perfectly how the fight between the two heroes advances. Impressive choreography!   The casting is far from perfect. In  Troy  the role of Helen is played by German Dian Kruger. In Homer's story, Helen's supposed to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Well, Dian Kruger is definitely not the most beautiful female on this planet. Of course, she has a good looking face and a perfectly shaped body, but to be truely beautyful, she would have to have charisma and personality. Kruger lacks both. I found her performance rather bland. Brad Pitt isn't convincing as Achilles either. He trained six months to get the body of a Greek god, and I admit he succeeded in achieving this, but to me he doesn't convey the image of a battle hardened soldier. He's too much of a pretty boy for that, I guess. Perhaps it's also his character that works against him. Achilles is portrayed in a very one dimensional way. All he craves is immortality. Why? I didn't understand his motivation. During the movie, Pitt's character seems to go through some kind of development, but in the end he still seemed like a whining child to me. Some of the actors were perfectly cast however. I particularly liked Eric Bana in the role of Hector, the honorable Trojan heir to the throne. Other than Pitt, Bana has the perfect look for a movie like this one. Maybe this was also because of his character. Hector was far less one dimensional than those of other characters. His motives are understandable, and I felt some sympathy for him. The same goes for Peter O'Toole, as King Priam. After Achilles has slained Hector, Priam visits Achilles to ask for the body of his dead son. This scene contains the only memorable dialogue of the movie. In  Troy , O'Toole and Bana are the only actors who perform better than average.   There is one thing that always annoys me in movies like  Troy . Homer wrote his story about Troy thousands of years ago, so the screenwriters translated it to meet the needs of a present day audience. Because of this, the dialogues and characters in this Hollywood adaptation have a very modern feel that doesn't fit the story. Besides this, important elements that were in the original story were altered, modernized or removed completely. For instance, Petersen decided to scrap the gods from the script, because he felt this element didn't contribute to the story. Sure, the gods don't play a large role in our modern society, so why not remove them from the story entirely? Also, the homosexual relation of Achilles with his cousin Patrokles was transformed into a platonic friendship, because homosexuals are still unaccepted in our society. The relationship was altered because the target audience might feel a bit uneasy about two men making out on the big screen. I know that Homer's story isn't an exact historical account, it's more of a myth. So I can't blame Petersen for making a historically incorrect movie. But I don't like the fact that Hollywood always twists the facts to make for digestible stories. Historical movies loose authenticity because of this. Is Hollywood afraid that people are unable to imagine what it was like to live in another time, with other customs and beliefs? The more moviemakers make history look like a duplicate of our time, the more it saddens me that people accept the portrayal of history in Hollywood movies as a true account of what happened.

        This morning I was worrying about how I could get the money to pay for my final year at the university. Just when I concluded that I couldn’t afford studying any longer, the phone rang. It was my former employer, offering me a temporary job. From October until January, I can work for the newspapers I worked for before I went to&nbsp;study again. This period is just long enough for me to earn the money that I need to pay for the expenses of my education.

        A decision about my vacation has finally been made! Me and my traveling companion will make a trip to the French alps. The lake of Annecy is our destination. We both had our doubts about this location, because there's a good chance the place will be crawling with Dutch tourists. And if there's one thing we don't want to encounter while on vacation, it's our countrymen.

       I read that a teenager has been arrested for recording   urlLink Spiderman 2   (2004) on his camcorder while watching this movie in a cinema. This arrest was possible because of a new law that prohibits the film audience to take recording devices with them into movie theatres. Offenders can be sentenced to a year in prison or they get a 2000 dollar fine for breaking the law. The kid I mentioned was busted by the operator of an LA based cinema. Apparantly, this employee used night vision goggles to check if the audience complied with the rules. This guy was rewarded with 500 bucks for arresting that kid. Distributors hand out these rewards because they hope that this wil convince more cinema employees to aid them in the struggle against bootlegging.  Last week I went to see   urlLink Troy   (2004) in the local theatre, and indeed, before the movie started, the audience was warned not to make any copies. I could not help laughing about this message. I found it so ridiculous... I simply could not imagine why someone would want to copy a movie directly from the silver screen with a camcorder, because the image quality of such bootlegs usually is extremely bad. Are blurred, badly lit copies really worth all the trouble? Is it that hard to wait until a decent version of the movie is released on dvd? Apparantly it is.  It's also ridiculous that distributors are putting so much effort in stopping this form of piracy. I mean, Spiderman 2 was released yesterday, and already there are copies circulating on the internet. There is no way to put a halt to it, so the only ones who fare well by the distributor's struggle are the cinema employees. If they really receive 500 dollars every time they catch a teenager with a video camera, they can make some nice money. We might be witnessing the birth of a new profession here, that of the cinema bountyhunter.

       Yesterday the infamous actor Marlon Brando died at the age of 80. I feel ashamed about saying this, but except for   urlLink Apocalypse Now   (1979) and   urlLink The Godfather   (1972) I haven't seen many movies in which he has a role. I saw   urlLink The Score   (2001) fairly recently. This one didn't impress me at all, and neither did Brando's acting. Despite this, his other movies are still on my 'to see' list...

There's one 'but' however... I will have to work like an ox to pull this off, because I've got so many exams to retry. Besides this, I am also going to work two days per week from October until February. Ack! I think I'm going to need a personal coach for motivation and stimulation when the next college year starts...

        I just discovered that I had some succes with one of the tests I had to do last month. I scored 6 out of 10 for the exam of an introductory film class. I suppose this could be interpreted as a very meagre result, but the thing is: I did not study at all for this test... I haven't even touched the darn book, so I think it's a pretty nice result after all. This is a perfect example of 'minimum input, maximum output'...

       In the glimmering world of the media, the summer is usually a dull period in which nothing really happens. Everybody's absent or on vacation, and the people that do work are lazy and uninspired because of the warm weather. There is a total lack of news, so many journalists spend half of their time eating from their noses. Don't ask me why, but the Dutch refer to these sleepy weeks as 'cucumber time'. News items that normally are considered unworthy of publishing suddenly become headlines in this period. After all, those editorial collumns have got to be filled, no matter what. You can't say 'Sorry, no news today' to readers.  Some journalists complain about the chronical news shortage, but I love cucumber time! It's the perfect opportunity to cover less important stories for which newspapers normally don't have any time or space. Today I received a phone call from an acquaintance of mine. He works for a regional newspaper. He told me that they were in search of free lancers for a daily serial about ordinary people and their jobs (the typical type of story for cucumber time) and he asked if I had any interest in this job. I really enjoy writing serials like these, so of course I am interested! I'm going to find out more about the job tomorrow. Finally, some interesting work again!

       Boredom got a hold on me this afternoon. My friends are not in town at the moment, so I've got to keep myself busy. I decided to get some books at the public library. I haven't been reading much lately because I couldn't focus myself enough. I had other things on my mind. The autobiography of actor Marlon Brando and the transcripts of the interviews of French filmmaker Francois Truffaut with Alfred Hitchcock should keep me interested long enough, though...

       I'm not exactly a sporty guy. Except for my brief membership of a local gym, I haven't participated in any sport since high school. Some time ago I got tired of panting like a dog every time I walked up a staircase, so I felt it was about time to beef up the condition of my body. I wanted to feel fit again. Teamsports are not my thing, but I like walking. That's why I impulsively bought a pair of running shoes two years ago. For half a year I tried to train myself, but it didn't work. When it comes to sports, I have a total lack of self discipline. My condition did not improve and I quickly lost enthusiasm. After six months I got busy with my job and my graduation assignment. The resulting stress was a perfect excuse to leave those shoes where they were: in the closet. When things got calmer I decided that I wanted to give running another try. But I could not push myself to really do so. Yesterday I could finally motivate myself, so I strapped on my shoes and ran for an hour or so. Now I can barely stand up straight because of my aching legs and back... Ouch! Myalgia sucks! I'm not going to give up this time, though (hey, that sounds familiar). My travel companion likes mountainbiking, so I've got to get into shape before I travel to France. Otherwise I will not be able to keep up with him...

       According to the annual report of the Dutch association of coffee producers, the Dutch are becoming more and more economical when it comes to drinking coffee. On average, they drink 3,1 cups per day. My consumption is way above average... I've only been awake for an hour or so, and already I had four large cups. Usually this number increases dramatically. Sometimes I drink more than ten cups per day. This is a habit I developed during work. The coffee machine made me an addict! If I don't drink enough coffee, all kinds of withdrawal symptoms occur. For example, I get headaches and I don't feel awake. In the morning, I really need caffeine to get myself going. I  urlLink read  about some of the effects this stuff can have when used without measure.   -restlessness  -nervousness  -excitement  -insomnia  -flushed face  -diuresis -gastrointestinal disturbance -muscle twitching  -rambling flow of thought and speech  -tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia  -periods of inexhaustibility  -psychomotor agitation    It seems people can actually die from a coffee overdose... Ulp... Perhaps it's time to cut back on my coffee consumption :)

        This evening I&nbsp;was&nbsp;driving from Hoogeveen to my appartment in&nbsp;Groningen to fetch some forgotten shoes that I need for my vacation. I clearly wasn't paying enough attention, because&nbsp;when I entered the city I was flashed by one of those photographing speed-o-meters...&nbsp;Damn it!&nbsp;I hate those things! On the highway&nbsp;I&nbsp;drove with speeds up to 140 kmp/h (120 is the speed limit on Dutch highways). Lucky enough they caught me when I was driving&nbsp;56 on&nbsp;a road with a speed limit of 50 kmp/h. Otherwise I probably would have had to pay&nbsp;a lot more than than the 30 euro's I have hand over to the police now... Normally I'm not really a speed freak (well duh, I&nbsp;rarely get the chance to drive a car anyway...) so this will&nbsp;actually be&nbsp;the first time I will get a fine for speeding. I think I will hang&nbsp;it above my bed :)

        Yesterday I had to visit Hoogeveen's shopping center, because I needed some new clothes and some stuff for my vacation. When I arrived in the main street of town, I was horrified to discover that it was  Pulledag . If I hadn't forgotten about this day, I probably would have stayed home. There is no English word that can describe this annual terror, but I'll try to explain...  &nbsp;  The summer is usually a&nbsp;worthless&nbsp;period for&nbsp;the shop keepers of Hoogeveen because&nbsp;most customers&nbsp;are on vacation.&nbsp;During the summer, shop&nbsp;owners&nbsp;have to make a living too of course, so they&nbsp;do everything&nbsp;to&nbsp;lure tourists and shoppers to their stores. They organize all kinds of activities to attract people to the shopping center. The result is  Pulledag , which takes place every Thursday of July and August. On these Thursdays, people can sell their old stuff at a cheap goods market, tradesmen sell&nbsp;a variety of&nbsp;junk in&nbsp;their stands,&nbsp;bands and&nbsp;folk dance&nbsp;groups&nbsp;give performances every hour&nbsp;and irritating clowns do their best to amuse&nbsp;visitors.&nbsp;As a kid I used to love Pulledag because there is so much to do.  &nbsp;  Nowadays I try to avoid main street when it's  Pulledag . I don't like it anymore. Every year it's the same. And besides, I don't like the people that are attracted to Hoogeveen by this event. Usually I refer to  Pulledag  as 'bumpkin day', because it seems like&nbsp;the entire&nbsp;yokel community&nbsp;from Hoogeveen and the surrounding villages&nbsp;gathers&nbsp;in the center of town to get loaded with alcohol and fast food.&nbsp;Yesterday one of them loudly&nbsp;belched in my ear when I passed by. A bit further a&nbsp;bunch of other&nbsp;morons had an alcohol induced quarrel. They yelled at each other as if the other people weren't there. They even started throwing beer cans around.&nbsp;Really, the average IQ drops like a brick on  Pulledag ...

        Now here's a documentary I'd love to see! In   urlLink Super Size Me   America's food culture is discussed by filmmaker Morgan Spurlock. He got the idea for this film after he had heard about a couple of obese girls. These oversized chicks took fast food chain McDonald's to court because they felt that their overweight was caused by hamburgers and French fries. A spokesman of McDonald's then claimed that this was impossible. 'Our food is perfectly healthy', he told the media. Morgan Spurlock tested whether this claim is true or not. Is it possible to live on fast food only? Spurlock had many interviews with specialists and obese people, and for one month he ate at McDonald's three times per day. He did not allow himself to eat 'normal' food. Spurlock wasn't exactly poisoned in the end, but his health seemed to have suffered from the fast food-only-diet. I am curious about the effect of such an eating pattern. I don't visit McDonald's or other fastfood restaurants very often myself, so I wouldn't know.

        Where are the men in blue when you need them? For the past hour I've been trying to reach the press officer of the police to ask him some questions, but it seems like the entire station has been deserted. No one answers my calls! What if I was robbed right now, and I needed help?

        And of course everything went as I predicted in my post earlier this afternoon. It rained cats and dogs on the way back from my interview. Within a minute after I had taken off on my bicycle, I was soaked. My rain coat did not help to prevent this. I often become angry when it rains as hard as this while I am underway. I hate rain. Usually, when there's no one around to hear me, I start screaming and swearing at the weather gods, which makes me look like lieutenant Dan a bit (people who have seen Forrest Gump know what I mean).

        For a free lance journalist, I've got an enormous handicap: I don't own a car and I can't borrow one either. This is a problem, because I work for the regional press, which means that I have to travel from one place to another most of the time. Today I've got another interview planned near a small town, 16 kilometers north from where I live. The guy I have to talk to lives in the middle of the woods. That means that there aren't any busses that can take me to his place. If I had enough money, I would instantly buy myself a car. Now I have to cycle all the way out there. I bet that it's going to be raining this afternoon and I will probably also have to clash with those cycling tourists again (see previous post). Great.

        We Dutch love to ride our bicycles. It's not so strange that we have a lot of bicycle paths in this country. Especially the rural areas are dotted with them. Drenthe, the province where I was born, is one of those regions. Every summer, thousands of cyclists from all over the country flock to Drenthe to participate in a large scale annual cycling event,  De Drentse Fietsvierdaagse . As of today, thousands of tourists will set out to discover the province for four days, cycling along special routes the organization has planned for them. There is nothing wrong with this event. Basically, I think it's a great initiative. Nevertheless I was a very frustrated by some of the participants this morning.   At 09.00 o clock I had an appointment for an interview in a small village, not far away from the city where I spend most of my time this summer. The weather was OK, I had no car at my disposal and I am not a big fan of the local public transit system, so I decided to grab my dad's mountainbike. Everything went well. I was there on time, and the interview was very pleasant.   On the way back, I came along one of the routes of the cycling event that I mentioned. For ten kilometers I had to cycle in the opposite direction of this route, so I had to pass hundreds of cyclists. Normally, this would not be a problem, because most of the paths are wide enough for cyclists to pass each other comfortably. Many participants of the event were irritated by my presence, however. These people refused to give me any space, and they often pushed me over the verge of the path. They constantly scolded at me for cycling against the flow. I became very angry when another elderly lady barked at me. I yelled back: 'For god's sake, woman, these bicycle paths are not just a tourist attraction, ordinary people make use of them too!' Somehow, these tourists fail to realize that the world was not made for them alone. I find this extremely annoying...

        After Ocean's Twelve, the colorful Dutch capital Amsterdam is used as a background for yet another movie: Deuce Bigalow 2. Principal photography for this film starts next week. I saw a part of the first Deuce Bigalow movie on television. It was so lame, it didn't even make me laugh once. The second part will probably be even worse. For some peculiar reason I think that our 'national pride' (the red light district and the infamous coffeeshops) will play an important role in this production. It would be nice for a change if the filmmakers would not incorporate these cliché trademarks of Amsterdam in their movie, but I don't have much faith in them. Hollywood's just too predictable.

        Went out last night, met a very nice person, had a great time... And now I'm tired. Actually, I was already tired before last night, because the past weeks have been very exciting. My free lance activities are suddenly blossoming. I received two long term assignments, and it's certain for 99 percent that I will get another free lance job on Monday. All year long I had nothing to do, and suddenly every newspaper in the region seems to be in desperate need of free lance journalists. Weird. But you don't hear me complaining!   Anyway, it's going to be one of those lazy Sundays. I just woke up with a hangover. Not a very bad one, but still... I'm also half deaf because of the loud volume of the music, yesterday. Let's hope that I don't have any permanent ear damage. Have to pay someone a birthday visit later this day, but I don't feel like going anywhere really. Can't stay home though! Today is one of the rare occasions on which I have access to my parent's car. I really need to practice my driving skills before I go on vacation. I haven't touched a steering wheel in months. That's not a good thing, considering the fact that I have to maneuver on narrow mountain roads next week. I can hardly wait!

       On Sunday evening&nbsp;we found a small campsite in the hills above the lake of Annecy, not far from the city.&nbsp;The site is&nbsp;nothing special, but it will suffice.&nbsp;We had to set up our tent while it was raining, so the next day I was happy to be woken up by the sun, which heated up our tent beyond comfortable temperatures.&nbsp;When we got out of our tent, we were surprised to see some blue sky.   We saw Albertville and Chamonix yesterday. I had my first mountain road driving experience. It didn't feel quite right.&nbsp;The palms of my hand were sweating all the time. The car (a brand new Fiat Panda) was not the problem. It drives like a dream. The problem is probably my lack of driving&nbsp;experience. I also&nbsp;know for sure&nbsp;that I am&nbsp;just not&nbsp;a very talented driver. Luckily enough, I managed not to crash the car straight&nbsp;into an abyss. I decided to let Tim handle most of the mountain driving. He knows how to maneuver the car.   My traveling companion wants to see the Tour&nbsp;de France, so today we checked the route for the last mountain stage of the mother of all cycling events, which will pass through this region in two days. It's unbelievable, but even now there are already cycling fanatics camping along the road. They really don't want to miss&nbsp;anything of&nbsp;this event.&nbsp;These fans have&nbsp;occupied the best spots, so I wonder if we will be able to find a good place when we come back here in a couple of days.

       Just another 28 km of mountain roads&nbsp;and we will have reached Annecy in 13 hours, after driving 1045 kilometers. The weather is&nbsp;disappointing, just like it was in Holland. The&nbsp;sun isn't shining because of&nbsp;thick layers of clouds, and since we passed through Luxemburg&nbsp;there was rain now en then.&nbsp;We didn't feel like setting up our tent in the rain, so we decided to head straight for Annecy in one day. Fortunately it's not really cold here. We're going to search for a campsite now.

       All my friends are on vacation or on the other side of the country, the sun is shining like the A-bomb flash over Nagasaki and I have no work or studying to do (well, actually I do have to study for some exams, but I don't feel like it right now). So how am I going to spend this saturday? The logical thing to do would be to pick up a good book, my mp3 player and a cold drink, for a nice, relaxing session on the garden terrace. But then again, I've already been burned like a crisp by the sun and I am in short supply of good books.  I suppose I could also join my family when they drive to Deventer this afternoon. There they are going to celebrate the 50th anniversary of an aunt of mine. My uncle has planned a special surprise. This special thing probably has something to do with water. Why else would he tell everybody to take an extra pair of socks with them? Hmm... I'm not sure what choice to make. Will my curiosity conquer my saturday morning laziness? Stay tuned and find out!

       I just got back from the office of the regional  urlLink newspaper  I started working for a couple of weeks ago. They seemed to be very content with the stories I wrote. Yay! Maybe they will give me a more permanent position in the long run. I owe my colleague and ex-fellow student big time for introducing me to the chief editor of  Het Dagblad van het Noorden . I hope I can write for the northern edition of this newspaper too. Gonna' make some new appointments for interviews this afternoon.  This morning I also went to the optician to check whether my sight has decreased during the past couple of years. I've been wearing spectacles and contact lenses since I was 10 years old. It took some time before I noticed that I could not see as well as other kids. I remember a visit to a cinema during a birthday party. Me and my friends had seats in the back of the movie theatre. Everyone was excited about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, except me. I couldn't see zip. On another occasion, one of my teachers put me in the back of the classroom because I was behaving like a little jerk. I noticed that I could not see the writings on the big blackboard from a distance. That's when it occured to me that something was wrong. Anyway, I started out with -4, and now I wear glasses of -7 and -9, which makes me pretty much as blind as a friggin' mole when I don't wear them. I was glad when the optician told me that my sight has not become any worse.  The glasses I bought three years ago are completely worn out now, so I have to choose a new pair. I took five spectacles home to try which one suits me best. Why on earth are glasses so expensive? I mean, come on: 600 euros for a flimsy piece of plastic can't be a reasonable price, can it? Luckily enough my parents are prepared to pay for the expense. I wish I could afford laser surgery, so I would be liberated from glasses and contact lenses.

We left our campsite in the small village Ouroux en Morvan at 09.00 'o clock this morning.&nbsp; After a long day of driving I'm feeling&nbsp;pretty exhausted.&nbsp;This is partially because&nbsp;I&nbsp;had to live through some very stressful moments on the way back.

       Yesterday I wrote that I haven't seen a single movie in the past month. But this is not correct. I've seen one movie in july. It was a French one, called:   urlLink Le Battement D'ailes Du Papillon   (2000) , starring Audrey Tatou from  urlLink  La Fabuleux Destin D' Amelie Poulain   (2001). Strange enough I saw it on a campsite in France, in the car of the friend that accompanied me. This was possible because he had taken his I-Book with him. On one rainy night we sat in the car to watch the dvd. The people who walked by our car laughed at us. Apparantly, taking high tech devices like notebooks, digital camera's and mp3-players on a camping trip isn't really a common thing to do yet.   Le Battement  is a sweet movie about coincidence, cause and effect. It revolves around the principle of the butterfly flapping its wings over the pacific, causing a hurricane over the atlantic ocean. Or something like that. In other words: small things we do can have enormous consequences. Sounds familiar? Well yeah. That's because this concept has been used in many other films. I like to think of this movie as the French counterpart to  urlLink  Lola Rennt   (1998), a German movie about which I wrote something in a  urlLink previous post .  Lola Rennt  seems to cover exactly the same topic.  Le Battement  was worth my time, but the core concept is very unoriginal. The same can probably be said about  urlLink  The Butterfly Effect   (2004), which is currently programmed in Dutch cinema's. I don't think I want to see this one.  Anyway, seeing only one movie per month is not healthy for a film student, so I bought some dvd's to compensate. After going through the bargain bins, I found four titles worth of purchasing. The first movie that I selected was Stanley Kubricks  urlLink  2001:   A Space Oddysey     (1968). I saw it three times in a row, a couple of years ago. The story is quite difficult and the film is full of symbols that are to be interpreted. I did not understand the movie the first time, so I went through it again and again. The experience was exhausting, because of the slow pace of  2001 . I really don't think that this film can be understood completely by anyone, not even by the filmmakers. Co-writer Arthur C. Clarke once stated the following: "If you understand  2001  completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered". Kubrick and Clarke have left the viewer plenty of room to come up with his own interpretations, and to me that's an important ingredient of good movies. I've been wanting to buy this film for a couple of years now, but I always opted to get other films first. This is probably because for me  2001  is not an easy movie to watch.  I also bought  urlLink  American Beauty   (1999). When I first saw this one, I really liked the cynical character of Lester, the guy with the mid life crisis. For some reason it satisfied me to see him break out of the cage of his life. This movie is also funny and touching at the same time. I can't recall any other film that has the same combination. I heard that   urlLink Lost In Translation   (2003)   also mixes drama and cynical humor, but I haven't seen that one yet.  The third movie that I spent money on is  urlLink  Alien   (1979). As a kid I was a huge sci-fi fanatic (Ok, I admit: I'm still quite a sci-fi fanatic). Along with terminator and Star Wars, this movie was among the films that affected me most. It scared the hell out of me, and I was very impressed by the Alien designs of Austrian artist  urlLink H.R. Giger . A friend gave me a book with images of his artwork some time ago, and I am really happy with it. To me, the biomechanical alien is one of the most effective movie monsters of all time.   urlLink  Sen To Chihiro No Kamikakushi   (2001) (a.k.a as  Spirited Away ) is the last movie I bought. Its a Japanese animation film. I haven't seen it yet, but it won a lot of prizes and it also received great reviews. I don't think I'm going to regret buying this one. But only time will tell...

       Just received the fine for  urlLink speeding  on the Emmaviaduct in Groningen. According to the letter, I have to pay 30 euros for driving 58 kilometers per hour on a road where a maximum speed of 50 is allowed. Could have done a lot of nice things with that money.

       You can say about insects what you want, but despite the fact that they are annoying as hell, they are pretty photogenic. I was playing around with my digital camera yesterday afternoon, and I decided to try its capacities for macro photography. It works pretty well, as you can see. I took the picture of the fly yesterday. The grasshopper jumped in front of my lens some time ago.

       I hate mosquitos.    In fact, I despise these winged horrors so much that I won’t go to bed until I’ve hunted down every last one of them.    It’s impossible for me to fall asleep when these insects are buzzing around in my room. They are evil incarnate! I can’t stand the thought of blood thirsty vampires sucking the fluids from my veins while I’m in the arms of Morpheus.    Parasites!    In the summer my bedroom seems to be swarming with mosquitos, and I feel obliged to carry out a preliminary strike everytime I go to bed.    Every night I wage war against the insects!    I say: kill 'em all and let god sort 'em out!  There are many ways of terminating mosquitos.    Some people like to smash them with a thick book, others prefer to use a rolled up magazine.    My favourite way of sending them to their maker is the sock attack.    It’s simple and very effective, especially in rooms with high ceilings. Just roll up a pair of socks into a compact ball of wool and voila, you have made yourself a deadly, long range projectile to throw at those flying terrorists!    The trick is to hit them hard while they’re sitting still. A sock may not be as aerodynamic as an air-to-air missile, but with a little training, you'll be able to achieve impressive results with it.    This technique has one major advantage over the other squashing methods I mentioned. When you hit the mosquito, you'll break its body, but the crash won't result in a bloody mess on your wallpaper because the sock is made of soft fabrik.  You've probably noticed by now that I'm quite a skilled mosquito anihilator. I'm proud to announce that I have just perfected my technique.    A couple of minutes ago, I managed to pick off a mosquito in full flight, crushing it between two fingers. You need pretty good reflexes to manage that, I can tell you!    But I've got to go know. Many mosquitos are awaiting a painful death.    I am the master!  (And I also need a good night of sleep. Why else am I wasting my time writing ridiculous nonsense like this?)

       I got bored of working, so I decided to download some music. For some reason I ended up querying songs that I adored when I was between ten and twelve years old. Hilarious! I can't believe that I actually liked overtly commercial stuff like  2 Unlimited  back then. Hearing a song like  No Limit  again brings back a lot of memories of similar eurodance groups, like  24Seven ,  2 Brothers On The 4th Flour ,  Capella ,  Haddaway  and  Captain Jack.  There used to be many of these groups, and I liked most of them very much. The songs of these groups were always made with the same ingredients: a catchy melody, a scantily clad girl singing a recognizable tune and a rapper who accompanied the girl with raps. Back in the days these raps sounded really cool to me, but now I understand English, and the raps like the one below (from  Let The Beat Control Your Body , by  2 Unlimited ) just make me laugh really hard.    The booming system brings bass in places     Move your system, change the spaces     When I'm on the mic you can't refuse     No I didn't came to preach, I came to amuse     Techno making no mistaking never faking     Always breaking it down, Hey to a party     Now let my beat control your body !        Whahahaha! Im feeling nostalgic here.

       Yesterday I decided to join my family to visit my uncle and his Thai wife, who celebrated her 50th birthday with friends and family. The only reason why I went there was because of the Thai background of my aunt. Since I am half Indonesian myself, I've been to a lot of Asian European birthday celebrations. These are far less static and much more fun than Dutch ones. I try to avoid Dutch birthday gatherings whenever I can, because I find them to be boring most of the time. Besides, they're always the same. Have you been invited to a Dutch birthday party? Here's a short guide that might help you to survive it.  At a common Dutch birthday bash, the first guests usually arrive between 20.00 and 21.00 'o clock. We Dutch have a tight schedule to keep, so don't even think about showing up earlier or later. This will not be appreciated! Upon arriving at the house of the host, the entry procedure will start. After entering his home, you congratulate the host. You also hand over your birthday present as if it were an entrance fee.  What to take with you as a present? A bottle of wine or another alcoholic beverage is a perfect choice if you don't know the host very well. The Dutch also have a habit of giving each other money as a birthday gift. A sum of 12-15 euros is sufficient. Be sure to put the money in an envelope or a Hallmark card, otherwise you will be frowned upon. Money is the ideal gift for people you don't really care about, because you'll probably receive the same amount of money from the host when he visits your birthday party. This makes the money transfer somewhat symbolic. Of course you can also buy a more personal gift, but don't exaggerate. We Dutch have an appropriate saying for occasions like this: 'Acting normal is crazy enough'. This means that showing up with very expensive presents is not done. Other guests might feel guilty about their inferior gifts!  Congratulations! You've made it to the living room. The gathering takes place in this room only. Of course you can celebrate a brief, personal party in the bathroom, but that's it. The rest of the house is off limits, so don't start walking around! When entering the living room, be sure to shake hands with the other guests and introduce yourself. After this, sit down on one of the chairs that are put down in a circle. Usually people remain on the same seat for the duration of the evening, so after the introduction, it's only important to remember the names of the persons sitting next to you. Yes, that's right, during the traditional Dutch birthday party guests don't mingle for intimate conversations. You are socially bound to the persons sitting next to you for the remainder of the evening, so be careful about the seat you choose! Have you finished talking to your direct neighbours? No problem! Because of the circle in which the guests take place, Dutch birthday parties resemble group therapy sessions. This means you can always join in on one of the ongoing group discussions.  When everyone has arrived, coffee is being served, as well as slices of birthday cake. Remember, there is only one piece of cake for every guest. It doesn't matter whether the host has truckloads of cake in the kitchen or not, it's just not polite to ask for more. Between 21.30 and 22.00 'o clock, everyone has had one or two cups of coffee and a part of the cake. At his point, the host will start serving soda's, alcoholic beverages and snacks. These snacks are sometimes passed along the circle of people on dishes, before they are put on a table in the centre.  The food is always the same. Usually there is an assortment of nuts, potato chips, cheese, crackers and salads to choose from. If the food is placed on the table immediately. Don't start eating right away. You have to wait until someone else makes the first move, or until the host says something like: 'I don't want to be left with any leftovers, people'. Feeling thirsty? You are not allowed to fetch yourself another drink. Don't you dare to ask for one either. The host will offer you a beverage when it suits him. You'll get three or four refills, depending on what time you leave the gathering.  You can begin to think of going home around 23.00 or 23.30 'o clock. Social control prevents you from leaving the party any earlier, unless you have a very, very good excuse, like an early appointment the next day. If you're not sure about when to leave, wait until someone else gets up to go home and join him. Before leaving it's OK to shake hands with all the other guests, but save yourself the trouble, because this is not necessary. Screaming goodbye to the entire room and to no one in particular will suffice.  Now the exit procedure will commence. The host will accompany you to the hall where you fetch your coat. Don't walk out the front door immediately. Take your time to talk to the host personally for a couple of minutes. He's been busy serving snacks and drinks the entire evening, so you've probably not spoken much to him. Thank him or her for the party and leave the house. Now inhale the fresh air and rejoice, you have just survived a traditional Dutch birthday party...

       For some reason I've always had an intense disliking of the seventies. The colors orange and brown give me an uncomfortable feeling, the music from that period sucks, and the ridiculous clothing and furniture designs of that time... Well, they're just plain ugly. This is probably why I don't appreciate Stanley Kubrick's   urlLink A Clockwork Orange   (1971), which I saw a couple of days ago. I like most movies Kubrick made. In fact, I own a lot of them. Many of his works are about people losing their humanity, and I really like this theme.  A Clockwork Orange  is definitely not on my wish list, however. This movie looks and sounds so dated that it makes me feel sick.  I know that it's not a good thing that I base my opinion about this movie solely on my feelings about the seventies, but I can't help it. It's just too much for me. I mean, take a look at the apartment of main character Alex De Large and his parents for example. It's horrible! The same goes for the music. There are many classical pieces to be heard, and these are brilliant, but Kubrick also uses a lot of garbage made with prehistoric synthesizers that really made me cringe in embarrassment. Even my parents, who lived through the seventies, thought that this music was stupid. They also frowned upon the nihilistic violence and the explicit sexual content of  A Clockwork Orange . This movie was x-rated for a long time. I guess it still has the power to shock an audience.  There are also good things about this movie of course. Otherwise it wouldn't be regarded as a classic by so many people. The screenplay was based on the book by Anthony Burgess. It's OK but I did not find it to be particularly interesting. It even bored me in the end. The story poses an interesting question about ethics and free will, though. The best reason to see this movie is the performance of Malcolm McDowell however. He's brilliant in the role of Alex. McDowell is scary, intimidating, funny, charming and innocent at the same time. He made me laugh more than once.

       Man, I got out of bed a couple of minutes ago and I feel totally wrecked. I didn't get a minute of sleep last night, probably because I still had far too much energy at the end of the day. I just couldn't find my way to dream land. Anyway, I don't think I'm going to be very productive today. First thing on my to do list is to make myself a large cup of coffee...

       For the past two weeks it's been quite hot in Holland. The high temperatures (plus 30 degrees celcius) drive many Dutch people insane. They flee from the cities to the beaches and lakes. I suppose you could speak of an exodus, because some days ago the roads leading to major bathing resorts, like Scheveningen en Bloemendaal, were actually jammed because of all those people trying to reach the beaches. From here it's a three hour drive to the west coast of Holland. What a horrible waste of time and sweat to spend all day in a car that's hot as a furnace, only to get to a place where temperatures are even higher. Some of us are smart enough to stay home. Take my cat for example. He must be feeling like he's in Dante's inferno with that thick, white fur coat of his. Luckily enough we have a small pond in our garden, so he doesn't have to travel very far to cool down.     Clever cat!

       Earlier this week I had to made an appointment for an interview with the owner of a bar in Mepppel, a place nearby. First I tried café  De Beurs , because this is one of the oldest bars there. The owner wasn't there when I made my phone call, so I tried to reach café  De Kansel  instead. The owner of this bar was glad to cooperate, so we made the appointment for three 'o clock this afternoon. No problem.  A couple of minutes ago, I heard on the radio that  De Beurs  has been on fire since nine 'o clock this morning. The flames are spreading to other buildings as well, so I imagine that it's a pretty huge fire. There won't be much left of this bar, That's for sure. Weird coincidence. If the owner if  De Beurs  had answered my phone call, I probably would have had an appointment with him, instead of with the manager of  De Kansel . And then I wouldn't be able to do an interview this afternoon because the man would have been to busy crying about the loss of his prized posession. I'm sorry for him, but once again I'm lucky.

       "So if I understand this correctly, you can't tell me what those technical terms in your own advertisement mean?" The froglike face of the salesman shows an uncomfortable grin and he shrugs his shoulders in an excusing manner. "Well, you know, it's impossible for us to know about every technical detail of these digital camera's. Four years ago we could test each camera ourselves, but nowadays there are just too many new models on the market. I wouldn't know where to start". He pushes the tiny camera into my hands, probably hoping that the mere touch of the device will persuade me to buy it. "It's a fine camera. Brand new model. You won't find it cheaper anywhere else. As you can feel it's light as a feather. It delivers fine image quality on standard print formats, and..." I interrupt his standard selling babble. "Yeah, I'm sure it does. Look, I've heard stuff like this many times before, but I still don't know anything about it's capacities. I've been to four electronics stores now, and I find it rather frustrating that none of you salesmen seem to have satisfying answers to my questions about this camera. So tell me, how are you people able to give decent advice to customers if you don't know a thing about the products you sell? For all I know you could be vending nuclear missiles here, without you knowing anything about it". The man ignores my remarks and makes his last effort to trick me into spending my money on the camera. "Look, you can take it with you to try it for a while. If the camera doesn't please you, you can return it to us within a month and we can let you have your money back". I sigh at his offer. "You know what? I don't think I want that. In fact, I think I'll return it to you right now". I hand over the camera to the salesman, and I walk out of the store.

        urlLink  Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi   (a.k.a.  Spirited Away ) (2001) is the strangest animation movie that I have seen in a long time. The vivid colors, the fantastic settings and the weird characters make this movie feel like a child's dream. The magical story instantly reminded me of Alice in Wonderland, The Wizzard of Ozz and similar fairytales. This is because these are also about little girls ending up in fantastic dream worlds.  I particulary liked the first half of the movie, where the main character, Chihiro, discovers the weird, colorful town, full of gods and mythical creatures. The next time I'm going to watch this movie (and I will watch it again), I think I'll have to do some reading about Japanese mythology first. This will probably help me to understand the characters better.  Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi  seems to be some sort of allegory, and I think that it can only be fully understood by someone with enough knowledge about Japanese culture.  I find it hard to believe that this movie is actually meant for children. Some scenes are pretty disturbing. What child wouldn't start crying at the sight of a faceless blob of a monster that chews on other characters?

       I had another one of those lame Sundays today. I didn't do anything worth mentioning. It was far too hot inside (30 degrees), so I grabbed my notebook, my cigarettes and a cold beer and sat down in the garden to write for a while. Luckily some of my friends got back from their vacation today. I'm glad they're home again. Hoogeveen was quiet without them. Tonight I visited them to discuss our travel experiences.  I have to do a lot of work tomorrow. I need to finish another article for   urlLink Het Dagblad van het Noorden   before Tuesday and I have to make some appointments for new interviews as soon as possible. I think I've got to write at least four stories in the days ahead, because the next two weeks I'll be working for a second newspaper. I'm going to have a busy time. I'm not complaining though. In fact I'm very happy with the work I've got. Finding a job as a journalist isn't easy these days. The bad economy messes things up. Companies are less willing to buy advertising space and people don't spend as much time on reading newspapers as they used to. Because of this, most papers don't have a large budget for freelancers anymore. Anyway, my other job is going to take two days per week, so I guess that it'll be necessary to make a decent planning to combine both tasks in an effective way.

       Yesterday me and a friend of mine rented  urlLink  Mystic River   (2003). In this film a girl is killed in a violent manner. Cops flock to the crime scene as bees to a jar of honey. The perpetrators are nowhere to be found. Two detectives (Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne) are put on the case and we watch them as they do their thing.  This plotline is only used as a motivation for the other, more important aspect of the story however. Mystic River is basically about three old friends, Jimmy (Sean Penn), Sean (Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins). They lost contact with eachother a long time ago because of a terrible experience they went through. While they were playing on the street as kids, Dave was kidnapped by a couple of men who abused him for four days. Many years later, the friends are brought back together only because of another gruesome event, the killing of Jimmie's daughter, Katie. Sean is the detective responsible for the investigation of her death and Dave is one of the murder suspects.  It occured to me that the three friends have one important thing in common. They are all driving their loved ones away from themselves. Take Jimmy for example. He loves his daughter Katie, but we learn that she was about to leave her father and family because Jimmy doesn't want her to be involved with her boyfriend, Brendan. The same goes for Sean. He pushed his wife away from him, probably because of his work as a policeman, and now they barely have any contact. Then Dave. He is the one who was kidnapped as a kid. He never told his wife about this, and so she can't relate to his mental problems. This ultimately drives them apart. I think that this element, of driving away loved ones, has something to do with the central thought behind the movie, but I've not been able to figure it out yet. The main plotline is very well done. The acting is great and Mystic River provides with great drama.  The police investigation, the main drive behind the story, isn't satisfying however. Part of the fun of watching police detectives solving a murder mystery usually comes from the fact that the viewers can join the investigators in their research. They can try to solve the crime themselves. If they succeed in doing so, they feel as smart as the movie detectives. I think this is one of the things that makes watching police stories so satisfying. In order to achieve this, it's nessecary to provide the viewer with clues. They also have to be able to follow the reasoning of the detectives at all time, because this allow the viewers to become actively engaged in solving the puzzle.  A lot of characters and names are introduced in  Mystic River . Sometimes this makes it hard to follow the logic of Bacon and Fishburne (this might have been so hard for me because I was a bit tired when I saw the movie). Besides this, there is no way the viewer can tell who the real killer is, because there are not enough clues provided. The end doesn't come as a complete surprise, but it's just not satisfying because you aren't really allowed to participate in the research that leads to the conclusion of the story.   Mystic River  tends to drag on a bit, but I liked most of it. It's not a movie that I would like to see again, however.
