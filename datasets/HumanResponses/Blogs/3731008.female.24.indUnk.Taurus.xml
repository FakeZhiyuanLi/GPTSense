      Election Canada   We have a Canadian Election coming up. Whats sad is I have no idea who would be best to vote for. I believe in change, so I would like to see our long standing Liberal government given a jostle. But not if it means a Conservitave majority. &nbsp; The idea of a conservative government scares me. Espeacilly after the conjoining of the PCs with the Canadian alliance. I felt the Canadian Alliance was a fanatic baptist-christian ideals group with a conservative twist. And although I never really liked the PCs I could see how they kept a balance in our country. &nbsp; So if I don't want thoose two partys, the only other major parties I can vote for are the NDP and the green party. I'm worried about the amount of spending the NDP would do and how it would impact our economy. They have a reputation for causing tremendous debt. &nbsp; Then theres the green party. They are labeled as an environmental activist group. Maybe they were in their old days. But their core principals have to do with preservation of many things. Our budget, international standings ect. Infact it seems the NDP has almost stolen some of the Green party's platform. &nbsp; My problem with voting Green though is that I know it is a vote that will not bring in green. It's just a vote for the loosing side. There is not enough strength in my riding to let green succeed. It will be a tight race between the other three. &nbsp; The last election felt worse though. Last election it was just a mater of voting for the strongest contender Agaist the canadian alliance or the conservative . Which was the liberal.  &nbsp; Bush was newly elected into office, and we Canadians felt the pressure cooker that was his temper with the mid-east. We saw him as a cowboy ready to shoot off his pistols. And boy were we right! We needed to vote in a government that would not only be politically polite, but know to stand ground and keep out of any turmoil and conflict caused by Bush Jr. playing cowboys and indians. &nbsp; On September 11 I was glad I voted the way I did. I Think that attack on the WTC was a comment of the mid-east against america and how it noses itself into affairs that are not theirs. I do believe it was a comment on freedom. But not agaist free north america. Not agaist Canada wich will play peacekeeper and clean up and apologize for the mess of our american neighbours. But a comment on how these countries need to be left to their own devices to clean p their own mess. Not to Occupied and policed by americans, to only have their culture disappear to american consumerisim. &nbsp; If we had a conservative Governemnt then, I am certain most of our young men here in Canada would have been at war. And Our beautiful north would have been torn up for uranium supplies. Canada would have been raped of resources to fight an american fight. &nbsp; I don't know what I'll vote. But I know my vote matters. It does help decide the fate and direction of not only our country, but world dynamics. When election day comes, We are taking a stand on how we want our country run, and where we stand internationally. &nbsp; Everyone please remember, make your vote count. And choose wisley.

      It has been SO LONG since I have been able to make it to the laundry mat. I had AT LEAST two weeks of laundry Plus all my sheets and blankets and towels to wash. I felt like a machine hog taking up all the good washers and dryers ( Although I did get there first) And now it's done, and all my underwear is finally clean. And i don't have to wear shirts the second time around. You know it's really bad when you get to the point your doing the sniff test on clothes off the ground. Then you have to choose between two shirts... they are both a little musky... but which is the least stinky.... EW! I have felt so gross these past couple days! But now I have bundles of soft clean laundry... So much of it my whole house smells like Dryer sheets.

      Latley,( and most of the time) I havn't felt whole. Maybe the best way to describe it, is that there is a space not filled-in, in my spirit or soul. A peice missing in my spiritual puzzle. I can't be certain, but I think it may be a need for congregation. A coming together of like minds.  &nbsp;  I have been raised with various religions around me&nbsp; I have been around spirtiual gatherings of all sorts I have formed a general knowing as to what god is , at least in my own inerpretations. But I've never been able to find an organized religion that seems to support my feelings on god. I think that finding a group of people who veiw the spiritual world the same way as me would be lightening to my spirit.But how I've learned religion and faith is not like how most do. I've been exposed to so much!  &nbsp;  I am sometimes jealous of thoose who are " Born again" Christians who can belive evrery thing their pastour tells them. They know and believe in their heart that they will be saved and go to heaven if they follow the bible and attend church on Sundays.I don't mean to offend anyone but I believe that this is ignorance of the true meaning of the word. And in this case I think that ignorance is bliss.  &nbsp;  However in my mind I have learned more than just what the bible says, and with knowledge comes responsibility, So then I teach myself more and more. Sometimes I wish I havn't learned all that I have so that I could just follow one story, one belief.  &nbsp;  My beliefs and faiths to the spirit world have complicated themself into somthing more felt and known emotionally than can be expressed in any words. So even if there was another out there with the same beliefs, I don't know how we would communicate it. I am almost certain if finding even only one other has been hard to this point, that a whole congregation wold be even harder.  &nbsp;  I hope I find a way to fill this hole in my being. I may feel alone but in the mean time, I have my faith, and I have prayer. Maybe one day there will be an answer. Time to stop thinking so deep and get out and enjoy the world!

      I ended up going for a bike ride today. I love bike rides, the rushing wind, the downhill speed, and to cover more terrain than your feet could alone. Today I went down into a river valley, saw gozzlings, beautiful flowers and trees. I watched the river flow as I rode beside it. I reached up and felt the vines of the weeping willows as I rode under them. ...Then I saw the gravel coming really fast toward me. &nbsp; I just knew that bumping and grinding sound that I was ignoring while changing the gears was bad. Well anyway my bike got me most of the way home before it decided to flip me like a martial arts student. A little winded and bruised I just walked up and out of the valley to a place that could repair my bike for me. They won't have their mechanic in till Friday so I guess I'll get my bike then.When I go to pick it up it's going to cost $40 bucks. As I had to make the long walk home from the shop I got to thinking about how a bike repair class would probably cost the same as the repair ; and the knowledge would be far more valuable than this one time fix. This is where I make a resolution to take a class before my bike needs it's next tune up.

      So last night Drew and I went&nbsp;shopping. I've been kind of Eyeing this one video game since I went to visit Kathryn and Chris&nbsp;in BC. I didn't play it there, I was shy about what little singing talent I had. But last night we bought it, and played it, and played it some more.&nbsp;I know Karaoke sounds lame, But it's a&nbsp;pretty cool game. It uses a headset to make sure your getting the right pitch and rythym and everything.Programs are smarter and smarter these days.  I think I've strained my vocal cords cause I never sing.  I wonder what our tennant thinks of me now thats she's heard me sing?&nbsp; ... poor lady....   urlLink    Cool Game. Check it out.   urlLink Amazon.ca: Video Games: Karaoke Revolution with Headset

      This summer Drew got a job working in a museum. He was super excited about it because it gives him the chance to get some experience under his belt. Afterall he is studying Archeology.   He came home in excitement. This was gonna be an awesome job. His summer co-workers were all fun, the job sounded as if it were going to be super casual, as long as they made up their hours every week, they got to make their own schedule.   But then , by the third day, stories started coming home about how the boss seems to have this certain muskiness about her. That nobody has seen her in fresh clothing. That they were all beginning to think that something was a little psycho-scary about this woman. While yes it is great when someone can be passionate about their job, but&nbsp;she way&nbsp;passed the line into obsession.   Well all of them needed some stress relief from the job so .Drew, me, &nbsp;and his co-workers all went out to a movie, where I heard these stories in no more exaggerated form than Drew told me and started to believe Drew wasn't just trying to make me laugh.   By the&nbsp;third week they learned she has, no family whatsoever within Ontario.she has&nbsp;4 cats, a lawn two meters high, thinks everyone else has communication problems, drinks alone in her office,&nbsp;prides herself on having a personal&nbsp;conversation with Dr. Phil, and that she does at least have 1 other shirt   This is where she started picking on the other male co-worker, .Between then and now there have been more stories to recount than one could imagine. Not only about her, but the crookedness of&nbsp;how she runs the museum   &nbsp;Well anyway&nbsp;that guy&nbsp;got fired yesterday, for as much as we can tell, not watering a plant he was never asked to, not stocking a personal refridgerator with Pop because he was too busy with the other responsibilities that are actually in his job description, and wearing flip flops to work when there is no dress code. Seeing his father works for the workers rights of Ontario, she has now caused herself more trouble than she knows, but that's a story that hasn't panned out yet.   The rest of the Co-workers have been given new museum policies to follow, not that it matters, they only have 2 and a half more weeks till their contract is done. They are all counting the hours and kind of wish they were the ones shoved out the door.   So, Drew and I invited&nbsp;His now X co-worker&nbsp;and his wife,&nbsp;and their baby&nbsp;over for some "congratulatory" beers on escaping the psycho-smelly alcoholic boss.( The baby didn't get any beer)   &nbsp;We had a lot of fun. They admired&nbsp;our house, we ogled at their baby, We gave them beer, they gave us chocolate.   I hope to have them over again and bring them into our circle of friends. Their pretty fun people. And that chocolate is amazing with strawberries, I'll at the very least need the recipe.&nbsp; =)

      So anyway, Archery was a lot of fun, I only shot 4-5 rounds, But I hit the bulls eye quite a few times, And I only missed the target&nbsp;twice.&nbsp;I think wearing my glasses made a difference. You should have seen me the first time I ever shot.( That poor bunny!)&nbsp;  I stopped cause my arm muscles were getting lazy holding the bow the way I was supposed to, I didn't have an arm guard on and I didn't want to bruise up my arm with the string. I Thought it safer to stop while I was ahead. With My extra time I went outside and practiced my knife throwing, which is getting great too! I had a lot of fun.       Also the friends I mentioned earlier... They are a officially a couple now. But not all the way out about it. There is someone they know who will probably be a little sensitive about their new "status" so they want to break it to her easy. And yes Jen you've met the guy at least once at the "fatefull" birthday party, The girl went to school with us, but is your brothers age. I'll tell you more later. I Love to see when romance works out. Of course I will take credit for it if its one of those "happily ever afters"&nbsp; YAY!

      So I think I'm gonna go shoot some archery today. Imagine that some one trusting ME with a bow and some arrows. (he he he)  I also had some old friends come down yesterday. There is an obvious romance starting to bloom between them, although they don't admit it. Well one of them does, he asked if I could invite them down so he could have more time near her.   It's kinda cute to see them together. It's sweet to see the awkward crush that two people have for one another. Especially when they havn't even kissed yet, They try to sit SO CLOSE to each other, but also make every effort to not touch.  People are so silly.

      I had such a good time at my job today. I Mean I wasn't rockin' it out like&nbsp;the gang at "empire records" But&nbsp;it was very personally fulfilling.  &nbsp;I work in a helathfood store. And while it's still retail, I really enjoy my interaction with the customers. While my responsibilities are of course stocking the shelves and running the tills, Any healthfood store clerk also&nbsp;has the unofficial job of supplement advising. It's fun to go through all that problem solving, trying to track possible causes to an ailment, and helping match the right products to help someone fight them. I do put alot of work and research in for my customers to help them.  But today I had most of my friendly regulars show up, they all knew me by name and waited on for me to help them , they wouldn't take the help of my co-worker. Today I even had a customer who has been going through lukemia come in and thank me for the help I've given her.   She told me she doesn't shop anwhere else or even come in to the store&nbsp;I work in unless I'm there. That leaves a very warm feeling. Gives an ego boost, and of course makes my job even more&nbsp;worth while.It's not everyday someone gives recognition and thanks.  I really enjoy what I do. Theres nothing like getting to help people everyday.

       urlLink     How to Bathe a cat   &nbsp;  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoroughly clean the toilet.  &nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Add the required amount of shampoo to the toilet&nbsp; water, and have both lids lifted.  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain the cat and soothe him while you carry him towards the bathroom.  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;In one smooth movement, put the cat in the toilet&nbsp; and close both lids (you may need to stand on the lid>> so that he cannot escape). CAUTION: Do not get any part of your body too close to the edge, as his paws will be reaching out for any purchase they can find.  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Flush the toilet three or four times. This provides a "power wash and rinse" which I have found to be quite effective.  6.&nbsp;Have someone open the door to the outside and ensure that there are no people between the toilet and the outside door.  7.&nbsp;Stand behind the toilet as far as you can, and quickly lift both lids.  8.&nbsp;The now-clean cat will rocket out of the toilet, and run outside where he will dry himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Sincerely,&nbsp;The DOG

      I'm going to the second week of pensic in August and I Can't wait. Pensic is this really awome historical recreation that over 10,000 people flock to every August. I also find it hard to believe it will be my 5th pensic I still remember my very first pennsic and how lost i felt and how ill prepared I was and how I survived on peanut butter sandwiches and ravioli for a week.This will be our second time camping witht the Rozakii, which feed us very well. I'm planning on loads of fun and maybe this year I will actually make it to an A&S class.   This year I'm bringing my Friend Amanda down for her first Pennsic. While she will never have the joy of scurvy while camping with me, I'm excited to see her reaction to this tent city. I'm looking forward to showing her around.&nbsp;It really is magical and words can hardly descibe it.   It's worth checking out   urlLink http://www.pennsicwar.org/penn33/index.html   &nbsp; urlLink www.pennsic.net &nbsp;

      A Single Moment  This is an awful world.Filled with tensions and angers,  All the frustrations and the dangers,  It's a wonder we choose life even for a day,  With all that goes on that we want to put away.  All the conflicts just to sort through,  just uncovering more to solve too.  It looks as if never ending heart ache,  and guilt from the hearts that we break.  Never ending pain and never ending suffering,  Emotions inside we keep on stuffing.  Love and hate that are forbidden,  are in each of us, hidden.  &nbsp;  It is often asked why we stay,  Or why we try,  Then we ask ourselves "Why do I?"  "Why do I mourn all theese days?"  "What is the point to keep on trying"  "It doesn't mean I'll ever stop crying"  But we do continue on the next day.  Trudging along the entire way.  Through the tensions and angers,  The Frustrations and dangers,  through the heart ache,  The pain and suffering that we take.  And yet again the next day we'll wake.  &nbsp;  But you see it's not all that sad.  Cause good can be found,Only through knowledge of the bad.  There are moments of happiness,And moments of bliss.  And it is for these moments that we strive to live.  &nbsp;  Rebecca Banks

      Boys will be boys?  a) For those with no children - this is totally hysterical! b) For those who already have children past this age, this is hilarious. c) For those who have children this age, this is not funny. d) For those who have children nearing this age, this is a warning. e) For those who have not yet had children, this is birth control.  The following came from an anonymous Mother in Austin, Texas...Things I've learned from my Boy's (honest and not kidding): 1.) A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq.ft. house4 inches deep. 2.) If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them withRoller blades, they can ignite. 3.) A 3-year old Boy's voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowdedrestaurant. 4.) If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strongenough to rotate a 42 pound Boy wearing Batman underwear and a Supermancape.It is strong enough, however, if tied to a paint can, to spread paint onall Four walls of a 20x20 ft. room. 5.) You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. Whenusing a ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throwthe ball up a few timesbefore you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way. 6.) The glass in windows (even double-pane) doesn't stop a baseball hitby a ceiling fan. 7.) When you hear the toilet flush and the words "uh oh", it's alreadytoo late. 8.) Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it. 9.) A six-year old Boy can start a fire with a flint rock even though a36-year old Man says they can only do it in the movies. 10.) Certain Lego's will pass through the digestive tract of a 4-yearold Boy. 11.) Play dough and microwave should not be used in the same sentence. 12.) Super glue is forever. 13.) No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you stillcan't walk on water. 14.) Pool filters do not like Jell-O. 15.) VCR's do not eject "PB & J" sandwiches even though TV commercialsshow they do. 16.) Garbage bags do not make good parachutes. 17.) Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving. 18.) You probably DO NOT want to know what that odor is. 19.) Always look in the oven before you turn it on; plastic toys do notlike ovens. 20.) The fire department in La Mesa, CA has a 5-minute response time. 21.) The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earthwormsdizzy. 22.) It will, however, make cats dizzy. 23.) Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy. 24.) 80% of Men who read this will try mixing the Clorox and brakefluid. 25.) Women will pass this on to almost all of their friends, with orwithout kids.

      Last night I dreampt of travelling excitedly in the dark, I was going through forests and following a trail for a long time.In my dream, I didn't know where I was going, but I knew I was near, I heard Drums beating, Loud and rythmecly, I was excited to get wherever thoose drums were, and as I got closer I could hear cheers and revelry from the people.I climbed a difficult  hill, It took me maybe 20 minutes to get up it clinging to rocks andboulders.  Then sudenly, I was at the top, I looked out infront of me and I  knew where I was. I was suddenly faced with a large medieval tent city, Hundreds of tents were infront of me in a large feild as they slowly drifted off into the woods. Almost every tent emited a sorft candle like glow. There were torches lit and I could see several fire pits. There were streams of campsmoke in the sky. People were dancing and celebrating The music was irresistable. I WAS AT PENNSIC !!  Then I woke up.  I hadn't even started my packing yet,I started packing right away, I only stopped now since 7AM to put together some food, Sit down and read some news and type my dream into my blog.  That dream has me fired up, I'm Ready to go and I can't wait. Maybe I could convince Drew to take us down tomorrow night. I've been told arriving at night is magical, I would belive it to from what my Subconcious made up.  More Packing to go... I CANT WAIT  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      So we have a new ( used) patio set. Drews Grandparents got a new one, and their old one was perfectly good so they gave it to us. Chairs table umbrella and all! Thats Awsome cause maybe now we could have a backyard BBQ. I Was thinking maybe we should have a labour day party here.  One problem though... No BBQ. We could always use the oven and let people pot luck some stuff here. Or maybe we will get our hands on a BBQ by then.  I figure Labour day would be a great day, Seeing that I don't think anyone will have to work.  What do you guys think?

      I'm sorry to thoose who read my blog to have such a string of cruddy posts. Good things HAVE happened in my life recently, But somehow I've needed my blog to get the bad stuff out. So here goes another rant for today.  Anyway, We have some friends who we used to see alot more of. Thier birthdays have past since we last saw them and it's been hard to keep in touch. We made plans to see them tonight. I ran around the house like a little cleaning Fairy for like an hour and a half preparing it for a pleasent night. Drew and I were hoping to suprise them with Cake and Presents.  At the very last minute, AFTER Drew went to buy the cake... They canceled!  It's Frustrating because this is the third time plans have fallen through.Granted the first time it was our fault. But the last two it's been theirs and the last couple of times we have seen them it has been at their place. I miss seeing them and it's sad we have fallen out of touch. I'm frustrated because now we have been left with no plans for tonight..And we put out lot of thought to spend it with them. SO now Drew and I have a large black forest cake to finish off to ourselves.We were really looking forward to sharing it with them. I'm feeling frustated and angry with them tonight, But I won't hold a grudge, It's not my style.  Also, I JUST had a slightly frustrating conversation with a friend about sexual choices. I care about this friend alot and I want them to make wise choices. There is a chance they won't.( at least in my opinion of wise choices... ) It worries me, because I care for them. and I don't want anything bad to happen.  It's a tough day to care for people.... Maybe I'll feel better after I have another slice of cake.  ************* After thought  This post does involve people I know about, and Care about. In Drews words of wisdom, It may be wrong of me to "Bitch about them on the internet". Opinions on this? If you know me, You may become a topic in my blog. I won't use your name without permission.Is there any other "Netiquette" you think is important for me to use on this blog? Should this posting Be erased? I haven't changed it from its original form. These are my straight out thoughts. I Do not intend to hurt people with my postings, This is my journal.

      I need to take up some ranting space for a minute....  So anyway, I had picked up a second casual PT job on the side. I was to be acting as a mentor / buddy / tutor for an ADD boy named "JP" ( For short ... I won't post his real name) I was to be coming over and helping him around the home, occasionally distracting him out of his mothers hair, help him work on some goals like bring his pre-school reading level up to a gr. 5 reading level Ect.  He is is an awesome kid. He bonded to me in seconds. He makes me laugh to the point of tears. He is positivly enthusiastic and I have a great time with him. In a month I already have him reading 3rd grade level books, with help, and found ways to help him focus. I have worked with hundreds of kids, he has probably been the most joyful creative, and naturally comedic I have met. He has respect for elders and has no problem following preset rules. He is amazing.   My delemma is the job has not been what it was advertised to be or what I was interviewed for... It was advertised as a "Youth Worker" job, but it's a straight out babysitting job. It is well paid, but it's not what I understood it to be. Thats not as big of a problem as the mother though.  The mother has recently been in a Car accident, she can't work, is in pain all the time, and is a very frustrated person. I've been slowly learning of the mothers temper, There was a hole in a solid plaster wall where JP told me his mother had slammed the door open in a fit. I've been told by the mother how she lost it on a camp couselor for letting her son play in the Mud at camp. By JP how she got angry at a Tim hortons clerk for putting regular instead of strwberry cream chees on a Bagel. And I've witnessed her loose it on her son for wiggling in his seat.  She has been putting her son into Day camps with extended care so he isn't home between 6:00 AM and 7:30 pm she feeds him dinner and sends him off to bed. She maybe spends a total of 1 hour a day with her son on weekdays. I'm beginning to think that she doesn't care too much about what he's learning or not, Just as long as he is out of her hair. She seems to loose her temper and yell at him alot too, And from my experiences with him, I see no place for that. He responds so positivly to attention.  I wouldn't say she is an "Unfit" Mother but she is a very angry person who would rather have others take care of her son at this time. I think this throwing fits is a very recent thing in the house ever since the accident. I Understand the frustration because of the recovery I had to go through. A car accident takes away so much ability. I severly doubt that the son is in any physical danger, He is well fed and the father gives him lots of attention and play time so he isn't "neglected" He isn't in a bad home, It's just the mother has some things she needs to work out. He is living in a home with a family problem that can work itself out with time and healing.  While I really want to work with JP, This isn't a good environment for me to get caught up in Or the kind of work experience I was expecting to get. The Mother could loose it on me at any time, and she doesn't add any support for JP to hold onto the things I teach him, so it's like starting from scratch every week.  I'm sure I made up my mind that I will give her notice that I'm not going to work with her son anymore. But i'm gonna give it tome time to figure out the most tactful way to tell her.  I feel bad for JP. I could do so much more for him. But it's all in vain without parental support. Also if I stick around any longer He will just continue to bond to me. Which would make a good-bye harder and harder for him. What sucks is I actullay care for this kid, and without the right support from the parents, or me coming over more often ( which won't happen) I can't help him.... I guess this is just one of thoose "POOPY" situations in life.   Well I'm glad I got that all out, but I don't feel any better yet, I don't think I will till I give her notice. Oh Well what can I do?
