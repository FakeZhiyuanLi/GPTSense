      Someone really close  I know, is feeling hurt  She is behind locked doors  And is feeling like dirt     I know I didn’t hurt her  But I feel like shit all the same  Could have done something to avert her  From all the unnecessary suffering and pain     She would never blame me  For all the dilemmas she had to go through  Helpless emotions would soon tame me  Because, helplessness is what is true     She must be praying to those gods above,  “Please do something to ease my pain,  Help me find my true love,  Who can end these days of misery and disdain.”     Somehow, deep in my heart I know,  Her prayers wouldn’t be of much help  Because she shouldn’t be escaping her sorrow  But facing them with her head upheld     So, on her behalf I pray to those gods  Strangely they’ve always been unknown to me  Strange are the ways they keep their records  Make me think if this how things were meant to be     Still I pray to you to give her strength  And a desire to always be free  To walk the distance or go to any length  To climb the highest mountain’s peak     And then in her will burn a desire  To find out how much are the ocean’s deep  All her dreams will then become a raging fire  And she’ll yearn for more before going to sleep     Only then would I consider my prayers fulfilled  When with her own wings she will be flying  And time would no longer stand still  And next to her wings will be mine

      Well, the long awaited results of our appraisals came in yesterday. So, did I do well?     "Do well", I think is such a relative term. The appraisal looks good on paper. But in actuality the raise is just peanuts. So i'm thinking, is it possible, that the place where I work has given me this appraisal so that I can show it to some other H.R. Director, obviously in some other organisation, and negotiate a bigger and better salary?    I think that's how it is, they want me to leave, but they love me too much to say it to my face. So I have decided to update my resume one of these days and start hunting for a job.     Harry ,    P.S. Maybe Tanuj will write about Ass Raisers.

      I think we'll start with a piece of poetry which is very close to our ideals and values. Although it is famous for all the wrong reasons, i believe it 's message is very profound.   Invictus      OUT of the night that covers me,     Black as the Pit from pole to pole,   I thank whatever gods may be     For my unconquerable soul.      In the fell clutch of circumstance             I have not winced nor cried aloud.   Under the bludgeonings of chance     My head is bloody, but unbowed.      Beyond this place of wrath and tears     Looms but the Horror of the shade,    And yet the menace of the years     Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.      It matters not how strait the gate,     How charged with punishments the scroll,   I am the master of my fate:      I am the captain of my soul.  William Ernest Henley. 1849–1903  Harry

      Hi!!! You must be kind of bored with Harry's monotonous life. So here I am with my own. If you don't wanna read any further, you know what to do ................... Still reading??? OK, I will start then. By the way, we are Indians. Not the native ones, the REAL Indians. The only similarity we share with our native friends is that we both hate Coloumbus for fudging our identities. I dont blame him entirely. These natives look like us. Infact I am in the US. There was this gentleman in the office I am visiting nowadays, who I thought was an Indian. I asked him,"Are you an Indian?" He said,"Yes". "I am from Delhi, where are you from?" I asked. "Montana" he said. I said,"That's fine, but where do you come from India". "India?!!! I am a native Indian you jerk" he retorted. So you see I dont entirely blame Columbus.  Alright moving ahead. As I told you I am in the US, Dallas to be precise. Nice city. Everything is big here as compared to India. Wide roads, big cars, big beds, big babes and the list goes on. They even measure in gallons instead of litres, miles instead of kilometers and something instead of something. So just enjoying Texas and enjoying the difference.  You know what? I am attending a training right now and very diligently typing this stupid note as the poor Trainer speaks and thinks I am taking notes. Actually I want a change of view. The training's so boring and the guy sitting in front of me sneezes at every 5 minute interval with a swiss watch precision and the rest of the class says in chorus,"Bless you". God, please let me die! If that was not enough, this guy cleares his nose and then looks at the blob in his hanky. What is he hoping to find? Gold?!!!  So I thought why not kill my time by posting some stuff in the blog than listening the trainer or watching this gold digger. Atleast I am not the one who's getting bored. Don't know about you guys, but if you are still reading then it's time to move on with your sorry lives and search for some other stupid blog.  Need to go now. I dont like the look the Trainer has now. I think ....

      Something just dawned today  It should have broken my heart  Can’t hear the sound it made  As cherished friendships grew apart     It hurts me somewhere deep inside  Yet I must put up a brave face  My heart is clutched by the hands of time  Once again I am left with a bad taste     Will they ever turn around?  To look at the friend left behind  Smile at that familiar sound?  When my voice is out of their minds     What if we pass by each other…?  And they refuse to even look at me  Will I even be able to run for cover?  When their betrayal is about to stab me     What is all this worry worth?  When you know how this ends  Like the memory of a worn out shirt  The time has come now to make amends     Like I have been told   That I am actually too nice  Time has come to turn cold  And not tolerate anymore vice     I somehow don’t relate this stink  It will change me slowly but surely  And then I am forced to think  If, I will ever like the new “me”?     I think I have been here before  I thought this is where I took a U-Turn  Forced again to pick a door  Perhaps it’s a lesson I’m not willing to learn     Now I realise the mistake I made  U-Turned on a one way street  Should have waited in the shade  Greeted the people who came to meet

      So... there we were... victorious... ecstatic... content... and broken. We looked up at the path leading us back to the place where our car was parked. It was quite a climb... and we had to carry our luggage as well. All of a sudden, two boxer shorts, three T-shirts and two shorts seemed to be quite a load.     Then we paused, and looked up, it was still quite a climb.    Then Shilpa shouted, "Hey, we have some chilled beer!!!” just what was needed. We stopped, went back into the shade. I brought the bottle along with me to the foot of the climb. After a few big gulps, I again looked up.    It was still quite a climb.    I looked at the bottle, and then I heard voices in the distance. Actually, they were only ten meters away. "Share the beer, you idiot." and I remembered there wasn't enough beer, and that once I got back to Delhi, I'll be meeting up with these people quite often. So the angel in me vanquished the devil, but not before I was able to take a few huge gulps and finish half the bottle. I gave it back to Viju, "It's half full!” trust me I had the straightest possible face at that time. I again walked back to the foot of the path going up. Looked up.    It will always be quite a climb    I turned around, walked back into the shade. If only one of them would say, "Harry, I'll take your bags, you take a rest." But, obviously, no one would and no one did. To add to my misery, we had just met the girls in the morning. Chivalry, it seems, is on life support. I just wish it would die, but it's a tough S.O.B. Then, everyone got up to leave, and one of the ladies was actually carrying two bags, for a two day trip. I shuddered, "What if she had to go somewhere for a fortnight?” That will surely pull the plug on Chivalry... Anyways, I picked up my bag and the spare bag of the lady and reached the foot of the climb once again. There was no looking back now.    I had no choice but to climb    "FORWARD!” I said to myself, and started making the climb.    This is torture, this is pain,  I think I’m gonna go insane...   I was singing to myself, and then I noticed Preeti climbing right behind me. She decided to strike a conversation at that time. If only she would realise how difficult a task I was handling. We started exchanging pleasantries.   "Doctor, the heart beat is picking up, I think Chivalry is finally gonna make it."  I just kept wondering how long am I gonna be able to talk and climb together? Stopping either one of the activities would send a very wrong signal. Then, I confirmed my worst fear.  I am my own worst enemy . Because, now I had very conveniently added a third task for myself. I was cursing myself for not being in shape, although I am a firm believer that round is also a shape, but that wasn't the shape I wanted to be in.    “That was quite a climb!!!”    Then I realised that I had finally crossed over onto the side of the multi tasking people. I was beaming as I loaded the luggage into the boot. Then it happened, the longest shriek I ever heard, not the loudest, but the longest. Viju had closed the door, and Preeti’s finger was getting crushed in that door. Viju was probably telling the driver to switch on the air-con or the stereo, because she seemed to be least bothered about her roommate shrieking outside, then, she locked the door. Preeti was delivered from her pain after 30 – 40 seconds. That too, because Viju must’ve started wondering why everyone was gathered around her door and also why someone was banging on her window in sync with the beats of the song playing on her stereo.     “Ooh, that must have hurt.” Someone said.  “Let’s stop somewhere and buy a pack of smokes.” Someone else said.  “And buy her a bandage or something.” I said.  Collective nodding of 6 heads followed. Then the drive started. We were following the ladies’ cab.   “I think anyone can drive faster than 35 KPH.” Gaurav said, while staring at his dashboard, “Their driver is an idiot.” Thankfully, the smoke shop came in 10 -15 minutes. We all got down, and I suddenly realised no one was buying the bandages. I rushed into the chemist shop, and bought the bandages and gave them to Preeti.    “Doctor, the patient has come out of the coma”    Then, the agony began, very patiently Gaurav started following their driver. After about half an hour, he decided it was too much. First, he overtook him, and then he simply disappeared. Actually it wasn’t his fault, the traffic and GD’s natural driving style just kept on pushing him forward. Once, we were sure that we had left them far behind. We stopped by the road because Neenu decided to answer the whisper of nature. Then we waited, and then waited a bit more, and then a lot more. After a good 15-20 minutes, they finally turned up. We started our car and unanimously decided to follow them no matter how slow they were.    Gaurav really needs a few lessons in patience. He overtook him again… and sped away. We stopped after half an hour. Bought some cold drinks, and again waited, and then waited a bit more, and then a lot more. After a good 15-20 minutes, they finally turned up. This time we told them to keep on going. We spent another 10-15 minutes finishing our drinks and the smokes, and then we answered a few more whispers. Then we started the chase.    “We must’ve overtaken them and didn’t realise it.” Gaurav said.  “No, we didn’t.” said Vishal.  “Now that jerk decides to drive fast.” Gaurav was shaking his head in disbelief. It took us another half an hour before we finally caught up with them. He was actually driving at 60 KPH. His face was beaming. He looked like Juan Pablo Montoya after overtaking Michael Schumacher (that too in the pits!!!), and then Gaurav overtook him. He still looked like Juan Pablo Montoya; after being overtaken Michael Schumacher (on the race track). Then we messaged each other to stop for a cuppa. When we stopped, their driver had such a sad look on his face that he could have made angels cry. It seemed we had broken his concentration. I felt like telling him, “all good things must come to an end, and so did your spree.” Gaurav got out of the car, the look on his face said, “You were good kid, but as long as I am around you will always be second best.”    The dhaba we stopped at had a very funny way of spelling its menu, it was actually quite phonetic. Patty was spelt as paytee for example. Some words would have a letter, and the dhaba didn’t have milk for our tea. So we moved to the next dhaba. Here, the great mystery was solved by Vishal. He struck up a conversation with the driver. It turned out he hardly drives. He actually owns a fleet of cars, and that the original driver had to go to his hometown due to an emergency. So he was just filling up his place so that he wouldn’t lose the business to a rival. Hmmm… smart man!!!     Then… the night fell, and his driving style came into its own. It was amazing, it was astonishing, it was a spectacle, it was… oh well forget it… it was totally out of this world. I had never seen such a brilliant display of indicators, brake lights and overtake-me manoeuvres. He was driving us nuts, and since it had already turned dark, we decided not to overtake him, and leave the ladies far behind.    “You know, when anyone tries to overtake us, we should tell them, this is a sale; you get to overtake two cars for the thrill of one.” Vishal said.  “That is only possible if he drives on the left side of the road and not in the middle!!!” Gaurav replied, “Turn around and see the train of cars following us.” This was a long highway, but not lonesome, and definitely not east of Omaha, and it wasn’t the engines but horns of the 20-30 odd cars which were moaning out as one old song. Did you always wonder how jams happened?     “Let’s stop at Cheetal for dinner.” It wasn’t far off and would definitely get this guy off the road and give relief to the poor souls behind us. Once at Cheetal, we all got together again, looked at each other, everyone had the look which said, “Yes, I am thinking exactly what you are thinking.” Smiles, nods and we went in. When we came out, I decided to take the back seat and doze off.     “Get up” Neenu whispered to me. I realised we had reached Delhi and it was time to say goodbye to the fine ladies we had met. I was too groggy to pass any more comments. We discussed another vacation, some other time, and I quietly slid back into the car and went back to the never-never-land.    Well that was quite a lot of typing, I have a lot more to tell, but my fingers hurt. So I think I’ll save it for next time. Till then, go to a driving school and learn to drive properly.    Luv ya all,    Harry

      Harry's havin a wild time. Isn't he? Well what about me, who has just come back from the wild wild west? You know what??? It's not the 'wild' that you guys must be thinking with cowboys wearing big hats on their big heads and spurs on their shoes riding on horses. Todays cowboys may sport a hat, but the hat is more visible at the Smokey Joe's billboards and if you say spurs, it means the San Antonio Spurs - the best basketball team in the US. Or the second best....Like I care. Anyway moving ahead. The only thing wild here are the nights. Man didn't knew night is so beautiful....I mean life is so beautiful until I visited Texas.   And now I am back in Mumbai. The first thing I felt when I stepped out of the aircraft door is the heat and the stench. It felt as if someone threw a dollar on the floor and kicked me on my ass as I bent to pick it up and I straighaway flew into an oven that was burning a pizza. Wow...what an imagination! Anyway all I mean to stay is that the weather really sucks here. I am entitled to say that because I am a Dhelite. And there's no love lost between the Dhelites and the Mumbaites. I miss my home town - Delhi. It's hot there, but atleast it's not humid. I melt like an ice cube here! Thought of starting to jog one day, but just opened the door and stepped out and that first step felt like a 100 meter sprint. And then what I do? I stepped back ofcourse! Closed the door, switched on the AC and went to sleep.  Mumbai's been rude to me and I haven't been too nice to it either. But the people are OK. They speak Hindi. Atleast this is what they claim. To me that's balderdash. But hey again....I am entitled to say that coz I am a Delhite.  Well I am kind of a loner here flying the Delhi flag high, so just need a moral support from my fellow Delhites. What you need to do? Just keep reading my adventure in Mumbai and my Mumbai bashing till you don't find me in this blog anymore, which eventually would happen when one Mumbaikar will bash me up. You know what? Is it Mumbaikar or Mumbaite. Funny isn't it. How confused these guys are. Again, I am entitled to say that...................

      The road ahead is curved and long  In your head there is an old song,  She was the one you really digged  She was the one you wanted to sing it with  And now there’s no one to sing along     She was the picture of perfection  She was the epitome of affection  Later you realised her evil designs  Another man already ruled her mind  Now she seems to symbolise destruction     If hell hath no fury like that of a woman scorned  Then what of the anguish of a man whose heart is torn  Disgusted, cheated, ridiculed and teased  What didn’t you go through just to appease  From the ashes of a burnt desire another phoenix is born     Accept the future built upon your past  Coming in second is as good as finishing last  Patiently you’ll have to wait for your turn  This is a lesson you’ll have to learn  Till then, I’m there, together we’ll have a blast.

      "FORWARD!!!" shouted the instructor, and she turned around and snapped back, "we won't row any more, what are you doing just sitting there and whiling away, now you row!!!" and the entire raft was silent, even the water seemed to have stopped splashing against the raft. Then a giggle started from the front of the raft... and percolated right down till the instructor. Then another one said, "We want a smoke... we can't row anymore... we need a smoke to recharge ourselves!!!”     A PAT ON THE BACK IS JUST A FEW INCHES AWAY FROM A KICK IN THE BUTT    "No smoking till we catch up with the other rafts"... once again there was silence all around... we looked ahead... the other three rafts from our camp were almost a 100 meters away from us... then we turned around to look at our instructor (by the way his name was Drona - named after the Guru of the Pandavas and Kauravas in the Mahabharata). He was looking like a rooster in heat... i thought his life jacket would burst open if he tried to broaden his chest a bit more. "You also have a smoke.” I said, even though I don't smoke, I just needed the break. I had been rowing for four hours the day before... I certainly needed all the rest I could get and I was sure the same was the case with the remaining seven souls on the raft.    WHERE YOU STAND ON AN ISSUE DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU SIT    There were initially just four of us. Me (Harry), GD, Vishal and Neenu. The previous day had been quite a sad day... we were teamed up with a bunch of horny morons... whose idea of white water rafting was watching blondes in bikinis and not the adventure of taking on a rapid. As you would expect from such higher mortals... they refused to row for the better part of the run... and when they would actually get down to rowing... they'd stop within a few seconds to look at another bikini. I was amazed; these guys would keep staring without even blinking for seven minutes. And, then came the icing..."look, look... tits!!!", the most irritating one said whilst being bang in the middle of 40 odd people.     THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL IS THE HEADLAMP OF AN ONCOMING TRAIN    Embarrassed, disgusted and definitely not looking like fresh daisies we made our way back to the camp. We took the manager aside and told him we won't do the run next day if we were again teamed up with those guys. I think it worked... 'cause he immediately suggested that we team up with another group of four girls, who'd just come in after we had left for our run. Then we thought... "What the heck? How bad could it be?? Couldn’t be worse than these guys."     A BIRD IN HAND IS SAFER THAN THE ONE OVERHEAD    So, the next morning the morons had a sulking face. They wanted to go with the girls... I think one of them was actually heart broken and was trying hard to hold back his tears. I felt sorry for this deprived soul... I wanted to tell him that it's OK, Life's like that ... you are a pathetic excuse for a man!!!    NEVER PLAY LEAPFROG WITH A UNICORN    But then, I kept these thoughts to myself... I am an evil man... but true evil hurts though inaction. Well, the morons were soon forgotten, and the introductions started... their names were Shilpa, Vijeya, Neetan and Priti. Nice peeps, and guess they had a similar story to tell about their run on the previous day.     SMART PEOPLE, COME AND GO. BUT, MORONS ACCUMULATE.    Well, coming back to the smoke break on the raft. Drona said, "okay, those who are not smoking will row the rest can take a break.” Me, Neetan and Preeti protested... you idiot... what do you think we are??? Then the rest of the smokers joined in...     A FRIEND WILL WARN YOU BEFORE YOU GET SLAPPED, A TRUE FRIEND WILL SLAP SOMEONE ALONG WITH YOU    I was so proud of my friends; I almost had a lump in my throat. And then he realised that actually no one was rowing anymore, so, to save his face, he said, "all of you take a break, but after that we have to catch up with the other rafts". That sounded like a fair deal. So, while they smoked, I rested. "One more smoke, said Neenu" and the anger in Drona's eyes could have turned into supahman's heat vision and probably toasted Neenu alive.    IF YOU FOOL AROUND WITH SOMETHING FOR TOO LONG YOU WILL SCREW IT UP    So we immediately got back to rowing and man what an effect did the nicotine have on these guys brains... they were rowing like mad. Only to realise that, the other three rafts had stopped at the next beach and were patiently waiting for us for the last 15 minutes. Obviously, we wanted our pound of flesh as well, actually an ounce!! Because we got to rest on the beach only for five minutes... and during that time we basically overturned the raft to throw out all the water. So no rest as such. The other rafts now seemed to be ready to move...     THE OTHER LINE ALWAYS SEEMS TO MOVE FASTER    After a few more episodes, most of which involved all of us jumping into the water and then me drifting away from everyone else and many exciting rapids, we got back to our camp... exchanged no.s and headed back to Delhi. The drive back to Delhi is another story... which I’ll tell you some other time.    THERE IS ALWAYS ONE MORE STORY

      Of late, I have been often told  I am becoming a bit too cold     I seem to argue a bit too much  Aware of even the slightest touch     My pauses are now a bit too long  And often break into an unheard song     Ignorant of all the people around  Head in clouds, feet on ground     All these comments seem very strange  Because I don’t feel I have changed     It wasn’t a stranger, who said these words,  We have been from the same flock of birds     All I want now is a hand to hold,  As I desperately try to break the mould     A voice which says, this too, shall pass  And kneels besides me to break the grass     I don’t need a lover, but just a friend  With a few moments of time to lend     To listen to what I have to say  And stand beside me come what may     Have a friend, who is just this kind  Of late she seems to have turned blind     Concerned about what people might think  Between us now there is a broken link     I’ll try and resurrect all that was lost  Too much have these changes cost     So come, my friend, let’s start afresh  Give our friendship new muscles and flesh

      Hi! I am back! Don’t know where’s Harry. Been a long time since I last visited this place, where I vent out my frustration. This doesn’t mean that I was not pissed off with people or I was not frustrated all through this time. It’s just that I was too busy with my sorry life.  Anyway, there is nothing new to write about. It’s just the same old story. I work like an ass from Monday to Friday and party like a devil in the weekends. Talking about reincarnation Ha? I am a live example.  That reminds me, I had a really different experience last weekend. As I told you, I turn into a devil in weekends. My friends like to call me ‘Hellboy’. They often ask, “What happens to you when you enter that nightclub? You lose all your ‘nice guy’ image and dance as if there’s no tomorrow!” And I always tell them to “Shut up”  Anyway, moving ahead. So I was in this nightclub and there’s something about those lights flickering brightly on the floor and on the sweaty faces and on the shining hair and on the sexy clothes and everywhere else. This mixed with the music and the acoustic system transforms me to a devil. And I like a wolf hunt for my prey.   But just like a hunter, whose every chase does not end up with a kill, I was also chasing and trying until I landed up with a babe, who I later realized was from my office. It was too late by then actually.   The darkness of the floor and my devilish attitude found the groove. Won’t elaborate on the details. It was for my pleasure not yours. But just like all good things come to an end, so did the night with the sun coming out again and all the creatures of the night like me retreated back to their dwellings.  And then I woke up. I have taken many lousy trips in life, but the GUILT TRIP is the most horrific. Once I woke up and was transforming into an ass again, I realized what I had done the night before. I almost screamed. My heartbeat was faster than the drums playing in the Hard Rock Café. My face was whiter than Michael Jackson. Hair (everywhere) were standing on their ends and I was looking like a freak from Ripley’s Believe It Or Not.  My roommate almost died with fright (I wish he had). He asked me, “What’s wrong with you?” I asked him if he remembered what I did. He said, “Hell yes, the whole world knows about it. I would be surprised if you are not in the evening news. ” He thought it was funny.   I gave him a stern look again and said, “Did I do anything……you know……kind of….vulgarish sort of……thing” He gave me that grin, which makes  you feel like beating the crap out of that jerk. He was happy that my doomsday is soon approaching on Monday.  Anyway, I tried coping with the nightmares that night. When I reached office, everything seemed to be eerily calm. People were faking to be nice just like always and all seemed to be already transformed into asses for the next five days. So their heads were inside their monitors. And they perhaps didn’t even realize that I was around.  And then that babe came. And I didn’t even want to think what happens next. But she saw me and then looked through me as if I don’t even exist. I got the point. And you can’t even imagine how relieved I felt. She was ignoring me and I started ignoring her. We are acting like strangers, like the two ships in the night that cross each other but don’t know who the other is.  And I happily transformed into an ass again. Waiting for the next weekend to come.

      Okay, what do you do when you across a person so dumb that he is pressing the down arrow key with his arm and at the same time is trying to use the mouse to scroll up on a web page... And then turns around to you and says... "I think someone else has taken over my machine... See... I'm trying to scroll up but the page automatically keeps on scrolling down!!! This so spooky!!! Maybe this is a virus"  Now for the icing on the sake... Replace the man in question above with a woman... And the arm with her breast... And the best part is ... This is happening with her for the second time!!! GAWD!!! How irritatingly dumb can anyone get...???  You know there are two kinds of dumb people... The first kind is like this...  The Boss: Can you tell me how many units did we sell last month...???  The Employee: No, but I can tell you how many times did Michael Jordan score off a fade away in each of the NBA Finals he's ever played in...  Now such people will obviously be considered to be dumb... But... If you look closely he is not dumb, he just has command over thoroughly useless information. (Hey, at least he told him that he doesn't have the answer)  Such people I can live with... If nothing else they make great partners in a sozzled conversation.  Then there are the other types of dumb people... Here is what they are like...  They'll wear extremely tight clothes to remind themselves that they need to slim down... Or mark stuff on papers with a highlighter, which according to them is not worth reading... Or ask, "then what happened?" long after the joke ends... Ok so you know the kind I'm talking about... These are the ones who I can't live with...  So I have started documenting ways to pick out such people from a crowd...   They are the only ones laughing at their own jokes in a group While everyone else is forcing a smile on their faces   They are the most conscious of themselves when they are all alone   They fall for the easiest tricks in the book... (IEEE they have never heard of - "Fool me once shame on you, Fool me twice shame on me"   They'll laugh at your most pathetic jokes   They are usually not very bright about computers and would never accept this fact   They are very territorial   Their proximics are totally screwed up  There are so many ways to pick them out... but these are the ones which generally some to mind... if you know more, then your additions are welcome.

      They told me  I am not good enough  They told me  I am too slow for this stuff  They told me   I will soon bite the dust  They told me  I will succumb to the lust  They told me  I just don't have it in me  They told me  I can't be what I want to be  They told me  The others are too fast  They told me  I just won't last  They told me  Life will always be a bitch  They told me   I’ll always be short of a stitch     Then you came into my life  And I felt a bit more alive     You might not know the difference you made  But with you around many things changed     It isn't only the things you said  It’s also the things you left unsaid    Those things you didn't say told me so many truth  As if I was growing another wisdom tooth     You told me  I am stronger than I think  You told me   I am smarter than those dinks  You told me   How I fell will be forgotten  You told me  How I got up is more important  You told me  I have an inert inner strength  You told me  I am capable of going to any length  You told me  I can be what I want to be  You told me  My will is strong and free    You my friend, will always be special to me  Wrote this song so that you won't ever forget me

      Come and take your best shot,  Be sure to put in all you’ve got,  Beware this is your only chance,  Cause after this I’ll make you dance  You might go as far as you can go,  And then prepare for my blow,    Did that hurt?  Did you just,   Eat the dirt?  Don’t you know?  I am unbeatable?    My yardstick is much longer,  You have to be a lot stronger,  You’ll never get close to where I am,  You’ll never be the tiger, always the lamb,  All your efforts are futile,  The gap is not in inches but in miles,    Is that too high?  Did you just,  Reach for the sky?  Don’t you know?  I am unattainable    Rub your eyes and reset your gaze,  Try and follow the trail I’ve blazed,  Yes, I am much beyond your reach,  It’s for you to learn and me to teach,  Of the cruel laws of nature’s selection,  Of how you can never beat perfection.    God is not, what I am  Did you just?  Pray to that scam?  Don’t you know?  I am Invincible    - Harry

      OK guys, this one's interesting. I am right now in Texas, sitting in my hotel room, had nothing to do so opened this blog only to find out that Harry is now Everysurdy! Anyway, it's his life - if he wants to adopt a even funnier name, it's his choice.   By the way, after reading his article, I thought it's high time I also logged in something. Afterall, you all have been waiting for so long!  So here I go guys with my story of how I made it to Texas. San Antonio to be precise. First of all, 1 hour before reporting time, I was still at the office solving situtions. Just then someone joked that the pilot called and is waiting for me to board. He thought I would laugh. Bad luck! I rushed to my apartment, emptied the cupboard and for the first time used my legs to pack the suitcase. It's a good technique actually. You can stuff in more stuff in your suitcase by applying the pressure at the right places. And so I was packed and I rushed to get my immigration done. Once I cleared my immigration and security at the Mumbai airport (forgot to mention I was at Mumbai), I just stretched my legs and tried to take the final nap before I embarked on the 36 hour long ordeal of reaching San Antonio. I somehow had this gut feeling that this is not gonna be my day.   And then I boarded the aircraft. I was sitting at my favorite seat - the window seat. The seat next to me was empty and then there was an Italian sitting in shorts proudly displaying his hairy legs. He was one hell of a talkative guy. And the rythm of his speech was beyond my comprehension. I shook head in approval silently for sometime thinking that he would get the message and would shut up, but he kept on talking about his great and adventurous tour to India. I know how adventurous it would be when he receives a card statement with double charges and rare handicrafts that never made it to his doorstep. But I didn't want to ruin my flight so I kept my mouth shut. But he went on and on and on. The more he spoke, the less I heard; the less I heard, the more he spoke.   And then the captain announced that we would have to make an emergency halt at Turkey. The reason - there was some oxygen problem in the aircraft. Ofcourse there would be! If only this Italian would have shut up, we could have saved on some oxygen. The aircraft was parked at Istanbul for 2 hours and then continued it's flight to Frankfurt, but this time flying only at 10000 feet, because the technical problem was not rectified. The only good part of that flight was that our plane went over many major European cities, over forests and over the Alps. I shall never forget that sight of those beautiful Alps. That was the only time I thanked the Italian for that oxygen problem.   Anyway, we made it to Frankfurt and it was time for the 5 hour halt to catch my plane to Denver. Frankfurt is a huge airport with countless duty free shops and lots of floorspace to sit or lie on. I also grabbed a vacant corner and waited. It was surprising to see so many people sitting on the floor. Indians should see this so that they start respecting a few things back home.   It was time to board. And when I reached my seat, there was a Swedish couple (I saw their passports) who were seated next to me. They didn't look happy when they saw me. I later realised why. These buggers just didn't stop kissing each other in that 11 hour freaking flight! And everytime I looked in their direction - not at them, but at their direction - this guy would look at me just to see if I am ..... So I had no choice but to just look on the right side and outside the window, which for most part was covered by the sunscreen. I was like in a cell looking at a blank wall in front of me and with a severe ache in my neck. To make things worse, there was a thunderstorm waiting for us at Denver. The pilot had to go around it to make a landing. It felt as if the space shuttle's taking off. We had a pretty rough landing and people started clapping when the plane finally stopped! But I was just waiting for this Swedish couple to stop so that I could get down.  Once at Denver, I realized I forgot all the documents to prove that I am on a business visit except to display my laptop. The officer asked for my company's letter. I said, "I don't have it!". He asked for my hotel stay confirmation. I said, "I don't have it!" The way he looked at me, it seemed as if he was admiring me for my guts while there was this patriotic military trumpet playing in the background. But I was wrong, he sent me to be questioned by another officer inside a closed room and all I could here was my heartbeat giving me a 21 gun salute for my stupidity. I think that officer in the room was the one, who had the authority to deport.   I though that being extra nice to him or saying even one lie would mean deportation. So I was straightforward and honest and he just let me through without any questions! Well after clearing the immigrations and customs and the tough security checks, I waited for my United Airlines flight at the wrong gate. The reason I was sitting there was because my boarding pass issued in Mumbai had that gate number and more importantly, there was this amazingly beautiful blonde standing at that counter. After a while, she announced for the flight to Atlanta. I came back from my daydreams to the harsh reality and rushed to the lady and asked what gate was the San Antonio flight. She gave me a sweet smile, which said everything of how stupid I looked and directed me to the right gate. I ran and ran until I reached there panting and my toungue touching the floor only to find out that the flight was delayed by 90 minutes.   I was already awake now for 36 hours and 4 more hours were to go before I reached San Antonio. I was struggling to keep my head still. Wonder what the people around must be thinking? I thought I shall catch some sleep in the flight. But only if wishes could come true! There was this Chinese-American kid of 4 or 5 years of age. He was a horror in the making. He was sitting right behind me. The flight was sold out and so I had no chance to change my seat. This guy would ask questions while hitting his legs against my seat and when he was ignored, by his obviously ignorant mother, he would start hitting more. He was much worse than the Italian I met in the first flight. Actually I started missing that Italian after meeting this kid from hell.  Atlast, I made it to San Antonio only to find that it was heavily raining and my hotel shuttle wasn't there as the flight was 90 minutes late. So I caught a cab to the hotel only to find that all the rooms were booked and there was only the handicap's room available. I begged him to give me anything where I could just lie down and doze off. The receptionist was kind enough to book me that room.  Well that was 4 days back. I am in a new room now and happy. By the way, I am tired now and I think so are you if you are still reading this. But if you are tired reading this, imagine the state of that guy who went through all this. Thats me....  Lonestar

      The helpline just called,  Spoke of an impending disaster,  A pebble snowballed,  Of a violent pet without its master.     They say they need me  They need me now,  They are such failures  They’ll have to kneel,  Kneel to me now,  ‘Cause I’m their saviour.     A brushing touch,  From the tips of my hand,  Doesn’t look much,  The snow turns to sand.     A broken crutch,  The pace of a snail,  Loser as such,  You were born to fail.     False pretences,  It’s always the same,  Heightened senses,  It’s just not your game.     If you believe,  You can’t eat dirt,  And one day the meek,  Shall inherit the earth,     Then look again,  Look my way,  Cry in disdain,  I’m here to stay.     Hard inside,  Harder exterior,  Swallow your pride,  I’m the Homo Superior.     The helpline just called,  Spoke of an impending disaster,  A pebble snowballed,  Of a violent pet without its master.     They say they need me  They need me now,  They are such failures  They’ll have to kneel,  Kneel to me now,  ‘Cause I’m their saviour.

      They were sitting on the next table in the cafetaria. He was the third most shabbbiest person in his batch (if things continued the way they were ... he would be at the top on the next week's chart). She on the other hand was not shabby, just had the looks which said, Stay Away from me ( I was just too happy to oblige).     Yes, you might ask if these two are married? and the answer believe it or not will still be in the affirmative. They hardly looked like the made for each other types, and i guess that they were'nt either. That, I think was the reason why these two had earlier planned a trip to splitsville.     Now this is the most interesting part about them. They were working together in a call center. It was probably good sex, and they decided to marry. they got married and then decided on divorce. I think the reason as that the call center they were working for closed down, or asked them to leave. Whichever way, they decided to go their separate ways. I assume, they did some maths. But, then maths is a topic which is not very easily comprehensible to every Mr. John and Mrs. Jane Doe, and certainly not to these two. So, I think someone else did the maths for them, and helped them figure out that if they were living with their respective parents, the financial strain on them would be lesser. So, I think, this along with their boring libido as the reason they separated.    And then, they started looking for a new job. As fate would have it, they both got through to the place I work. They didn't tell each other that they had got the job here. They were both in different induction batches. True to the psychological profile of such people, these two were sympathy mongers. The moment the trainer asked them to tell something about him/herself, they regaled their sad life stories, of how they got married, then seperated and all the usual booo hooo hooos. And at lunch, they saw each other.     He: You b!tc#, what are you doin here?  She: You Mother F@&amp;^%r, I am working here, what are you doin here?  He: Me too.    She was silent. They didn't tell anyone that they were married. They had just vented their spleen on each other a couple of hours ago, and right now love was in the air.     So now these two have lunch together. Go out on breaks together. He fights with the people who decide to say somethingto his wife... and all in all they just don't sleep together a night. I think that should change after next month's salary is debited to their acoounts.

         Crossing the street alongside strangers Thinking deeply of how everything changes Of how much I have now achieved Without sacrificing any of my beliefs I have a glimpse of what the future holds A precognition of the glories foretold  One day I'll have the power to have anything That day, when I am a king, If I gave up everything, For just one thing, Wouldn't that thing, Be really something?  One day, when I really begin to fly One day, when I reach really high I'll turn a new page, not turn around, Head for the stars, lift off the ground, With my future all the more bright, And with newer battles for me to fight    That day I will once again spread my wings That day, when I am a king, If I gave up everything, For just one thing, Wouldn't that thing, Be really something?  With the new path comes a new gait, Alone for me to walk, with no one to wait Companions will slow down the speed With their own desires and selfish needs Too much to risk too much to steer, Will go through it again right here,  That day I will once again have loaded guns That day, when I am the one, If I gave up everyone, For just one person, Wouldn't that person, Be really someone?

      There is a story, my friends would tell, Of how high I was, and how hard I fell, A story about success despite disaster, Of a slave destined to be his own master. There was a fight which had once come my way, Arrogance by my side, I made the choice to stay, Outnumbered, I lost the battle, but not my pride, My friends reassured that I fought the good fight.  … And then they whispered to me…  Look… Here… You’re alive, You’ve got to take this fall in your stride, Today you can’t crawl, But tomorrow you will walk, run and Fly.  There I lay, battered and bruised, No words of courage, or abuse, Then I felt it, like a Midas touch, A few people waiting for me to get up, The rest had seen me take the tumble, Walked away, thinking, I’ve been humbled. Just because I lost, doesn’t mean I’ll yield, They were still there, when I stepped off the field.  … And then I heard the unsaid words…  Look… Here… You’re alive, The way you fought, fills us with pride, Today you can’t walk, But tomorrow you will run and Fly.  Invincible are the enemies you can no longer hurt, And it’s better to let them go, like a worn out shirt. Then I stepped onto another battleground, My defeat was famous, and challengers abound, And I fought them all, didn’t hold back, Like me everyone else was bruised, blue and black As I stepped off, some faces were missing, There were new ones there, like a blessing,  … And to the departed ones I said…  Look… Here… I am alive, What you gave me, can’t be priced, Today I can’t run, But tomorrow I am going to Fly.  From all my battles, a lot I had learnt, No longer did revenge, hopelessly burn, I came across many, so called the best, They failed time and again, at my test, The lesson they learnt,  was for all to see, They were the best, till they came across me, And now I shall, spread my wings to fly, To join the flock, up there in the sky,  … And together we all will sing…  Look… Here… We’re alive, We stood by each other, and through time, Today if we fall, Tomorrow we shall crawl, walk, run and Fly.   -Harry

      Being the best doesn't mean that there is no one better than you... It simply means that you still haven't come across anyone better than you.
