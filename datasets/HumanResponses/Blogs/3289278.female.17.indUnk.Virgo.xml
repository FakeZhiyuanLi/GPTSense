      What did I learn in webmastering. Well  nothing!!  Nah just playing I learned a lot about computers. I mean I already new how to use the internet but I learned how to make a webpage to show the whole world who I am. Isn't that cool, Something that I enjoy. I love writing and giving advice.   Here with Mr. Rae I learned not only about computers but about myself and others. I learned that Mr. Rae can be a butt head but sometimes cool. Well about computers I learned how to do a skeleton and how to make words or phrases bigger or better. For them to move or jump up and down.

      I bet you are wondering what is boredom. Well boredom leads to drug use, violence, gang involvement, and teen pregnancy. How do teenagers handle it? In my opinion a lot of teenagers get into drugs, and gangs when they are in middle school. Its hard to handle it because they have pressure from their friends telling them if they don't do it they ain't cool.   Teen pregnancy and violence would be in high school when more teens are sexually active. For me, I handle it in my own way, by hanging out with people I like and don't do drugs or anything.  Some people that have been their for me to help me, would be my best friends and boyfriend. And of course my soccer team. Im so into soccer that I don't care about anything else. My friends handle it the same way too.  Here is my love of my life, and my friends

      What a game. Do you think? Man it was the best game ever we won and we kicked some ass. Literally We kicked some ass. It was a sunny sweaty game that we got tired of those girls trying to push us around. Man their in our house Sh** no one messes with us. It all started when Daisy form our team pushed a girl and she fell in between the trees. That was funny. Then this other girl stupid girl grabed Vero by her shirt a pulled her. Vero just swong but missed. She got out of the game because she was mad.   Then like six girls from Sanchez tried to get Maria and talk shit. That girl that grabed Vero pushed me saying that I pushed her. So of course I wasent going to let myselg get pushed so I pushed her she went back. Thats when Natalie came in and started talking mess to all fo them. Then I just saw Natalie swing to the girl. I wasent going to let her by herslef so I jumped in. In that moment a guy from Sanchez came in and swong at Maria. Maria didnt let herslef so she hit him back. Like I said No One messes with Eastwood Soccer Girls.  GO ADIDAS!!

      My glasses because I cant see without them so it will be much easier. I would be able to examine things that I could never ever had. My glasses always see me every morning and Eddie everyday. I would be able to see the my dreams when I sleep. If I were my glasses I would be able to see everything because I am blind.

       I have a big family like you know every Mexican family has a big family. I get along with some of my cousins and my aunts/uncles. One person that I look up to and I think is the best would be my aunt Emmanuela She has been thtough thick and thin and is still here. She has two daughter, the most beautiful girls. My uncle does anything for her because does who much he loves her. I adore my aunt because when she was young she got pregnant with my cousin, she had to drop out of school and take care of them. After she had my cousins she went back to school graduated and its in college right now. She has been a big part if my life and always will.

      There is a lot of things I want for my future is just a matter of time for me to accomplish all my goals. For my future, I want a good career, I want to study criminal justice and mortician. The people that aspire me would be my parents because they never went to college and they want the best for their children. I'm really confuse to what school I want to go to. One school that calls my attention would be U Austin, and Texas A&M. Why? Because their good schools to go to. Also because my boyfriend wants to go to U.T.Theoretically I'm suppose to know what I want to study and what I want for my future, but I don't know. Well for my my future, well I just hope to have one. A good one. I hope to be married and have four kids, I hope to accomplish all my dreams and goals.

       There are a lot of things I regret especially when I was younger. I f***ed up so bad that I came to the point of killing myself. For me, what I did was wrong I never thought that I could hurt my family this much. I regret hurting my family. When I was in seventh grade I wanted to be cool like my friends and snuck a guy in my house, it was my two friends and two guys. My dad went in the room and caught them in there he got all mad to the point that we had to call the ambulance.  After this day I never had my parents trust. I had to gain it little by little even to this day my mom thinks wrong about me. I wish I had never done this but that's the past Cant really do anything about it just try to be better.   One of my favorite website is  urlLink Cruz Azul

       How can I start, why the twisted world, well for a lot of reasons, their are the crazy people living here. The people who do drugs, and there are the homosexual, now that's cool. Well for some people their cool for others that nasty. Well gay guys their cool, I love gay guys, but I also love girls. That's why im a bisexual. I love guys and girls. My boyfriend loves me a lot. He understands that my girlfriend loves me and she wants to be with me. Her name is Araceli.   The world is twisted because there are all these things. Man there are crazy people talking about witchcraft and about wishing people were dead. Man how the f*** you are going to wish for a person to die. You must be stupid or something. Why do people do drugs? I don't know... Maybe because they don't feel love, they want to be cool. I don't uderstand this stupid world but I cant really judge this world because I am doing wrong here too.   Why are there people who abuse of children, and man who rape girls. Why do they do that. What they cant get none. That's so stupid, only if we all knew who they were so we can beat them up so they can learn their lesson just don't understand this world why do much chaos and there is a lot of order. Why people have to be like this. I hate people I hate everyone.   Why are there lesbians and gay guys. Why do they prefer the same sex? Whets is so good about having each other like that. I heard that woman become lesbian because man treat them wrong and they get hurt guys I don't really know.. I don't understand, I have a friend he loves guys and he said that's since he was a little boy he was attracted to guys.
