       This is my first time using blogger........i didn't know how to change the page.......so.....i got this page which is so........ :(....... Never mind   This page is everything about....yaaaaa me..........quite boring but i don't have anything on now...so i did this blog.....   I go to school like everyone but not quite similar like everyone.......i meet alot of difficulties in school and alot that i don't know what to do with them.....one musn't avoid it but....it's so hard to do that......therefore, i had to think of stupid things that solves some of the problems but....not all....of course...   Everyday i come to school....i have to pull a long face.....keep happy all the time when i know that some of them don't like me......i'm not going to say their name but i'm going to give them nicknames.....let me think......Ah...one will be called......linky.......i don't really like her but she always comes to eat with me when i don't really like to her......and the other is...... biggy and she's by good friend...and i normally hang out with them.....biggy and linky......    Now....they are my friends.......but...i don't really like them alot and especially linky and don't ask me why and how.....   Let's see......i like to eat stuffs like potato chips and others.....i don't really actually know what i like to eat actually........But....i do hope to have the time to write in my blog because i do need to study hard to keep up with others....... Next time i write again in my blog....i hope to write more about myself and this blog i'm writing.......i have to keep it away from that linky especially because she will definitely make comments about me which is very depressing and she is so proud of herself........always think that she's better that anyone.....likes to listen to.....Jay Chou...what's the big deal with that guy anyway? The problem with linky is that she likes to make fun of others and especailly me.....She's such an idiotic girl that i hate her to the core....but i put a strong front in front of her lah......she make me angry and the next day...i'n still angry but i still have to be happy because if i'm still angry with her...she will call me petty.....she even call me a freak....she's the real freak man......share drinks with&nbsp;  other people and   even man.......i'm not saying that's illegal but...she do it soooo often...   Aiyah...got to go......need to study.......    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;
