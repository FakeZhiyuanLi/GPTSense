      Tomorrow folks is my last day of unemployment.  Friday at a nice and easy time of 9:30 I am to report to the new job.  I'm not quite sure what I should do to make the last the barn-burner that I guess it should be.  I am going to see "Spider-Man 2" with Benny which is a nice capper of the day, but what to fill that time with.  Minus watching my 2 hours of "The West Wing" that is.  I think I might get my haircut.  My second one in as many years.  I'll mosey on over to Richard's and get the chop.    So I ask of you, my fellow bloggers, for serious (thats right, don't waste my time bitches) suggestions of what to do on my last day of freedom from the man.  Commence!

      1.  Astro Burger's(Gardner and Santa Monica) Double Chili Cheeseburger.  Order fries with this one as the chili that oozes off the burger will be able to cover all the spuds.    2.  Katsu-ya's (Ventura Blvd. Studio City) baked crab roll and crispy rice w/ spicey tuna.  The two most delicious sushi meals I've ever had.  The place is small and quaint, but often crowded so call ahead!    3.  101 Cafe's (Franklin Ave, just east of the 101 overpass) french fries and frosted milkshake.  Their fries are both regular and sweet potato fries mixed, so they are even more delicious.  The milkshake contains a little bit of root beer and vanilla ice cream mixed together for the most freshing milkshake around.  Keep your eyes peeled for celebs chillin' out to the raddest jukebox in town.    4.  The Griddle Cafe's (Sunset Blvd. right next to the DGA) French Toast.  Best french toast ever.    5.  Morel's (@ the Grove) Seared Mahi Mahi (or Ahi Tuna, I always forget).  Delicious dish that is safe for the hips.  Add a bottle of great red wine, a cheese platter, and the amazing chocolate mousse for dessert and you have a delightful night out.  A lot of people tell bad stories of this place, but I've been there over 10 times now and never had bad service or bad food.  It comes in at #5.    Eat hearty my friends.

      Take from  urlLink The Hot Button :  "I SAW WHITE CHICKS on Tuesday night. It was my 13-year-old niece's idea.   There is no point in reviewing the movie. There is no point in the movie. But what did occur to me is that the Wayans Bros. could be the Three Stooges or even the Marx Bros. of this generation. They are not as funny as the Stooges or as sophisticated and well defined as the Marxes, but that may not be their fault.  There are two legitimate performing stars in the Wayans family, Damon and Marlon. Damon has shown his metal in a number of films, proving that he has the ability to build and sustain a character, even though he has never had the great role. Marlon knocked me off my feet with his performance in Requiem For A Dream, which I consider as good or better than anyone else's in that film.   Shawn Wayans, who co-stars with Marlon in White Chicks, is kind of the Allan Jones of the group… good looking and not very interesting. Keenan Ivory Wayans is the eldest son and leader, most often directing his sibs.   But what got me thinking was that these are funny people, even when their movies miss the mark. What if they had the opportunity, as The Marx Brothers, the Stooges and so many others had to sharpen ideas and perfect what would go in front of the camera by taking it on stage in front of a live audience?"  If they were given more time to perfect their craft in front of an audience?  How long do you think it takes to put together a movie you douchebag?  They can take all the damn time they want to rehearse and get the material right, but they aren't going to.  They aren't "craftsman".  They are people who can make an audience laugh every so often enough to get another movie greenlit.  In the pantheon of comedy, the Wayans Bros. would only leave their mark on the underwear of Buddy Hackett.

      1.  Michael Moore-say what you will, he is manipulating the facts, he's making up lies, etc.  this guy can make a fucking movie.  He is in such command of his craft that even if i KNOW he's making up the facts, he still makes it interesting, effective, and entertaining.  2.  The BBQ chicken salad at the Woodranch Grille.  It is a salad that rivals fried pizza in health, but the taste is equally good for your soul.  3.  Drinking in the afternoon-I don't think there is any more pleasure in life than being able to stumble home drunk from a bar at 4pm.  I might have been the only male in the bar, besides the skank bartender, but it is lovely to bare witness to life outside of the working.    4. The song "Ambulence" by TV on the Radio.  Sample lyric:   you're to blame for wasted words of sad refrain oh let them take me where they may believe me when i say i will be your accident if you will be my ambulance and i will be your screech and crash if you will be my crutch and cast and i will be your one more time if you will be my one last chance oh fall for me   5.  "Sleeper" by Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips-an espionage comic with a super-hero twist.  The story is complex and the characters all amoral sons-of-bitches.  A man who can feel no pain and can only use anger as a weapon.  A beautifully drawn story of a world with no sides, only the people that live within the middle of good and evil.

      Is there anything more pleasant than frozen yogurt with oreo bits mixed in on a mildly hot summer sunday afternoon?    The answer is no.    I think I'm one of the only people to respond to blog posts in the actual blog and not write a response in my own space.  That is why i have one of the lowest outputs among this little melange (urby, i'm looking in your direction as not pouring your soul out on the page.  the people want more urby, so give them what they want).     I need someone to teach me how to put pictures up on this thing as well.  thanks.

      Brennon wrote to me a few days ago and I didn't mention it here for whatever reason, but here is the news:  City Video's last night in business was yesterday.    So thats it.  The lights are off, the gate i down.  Bill Turbert will masturbate no more...  Here is his email:  "Got a call at 6:30 the other night from Andy. They sold the entire stock of City Video - on eBay of all places - to some joint in Missouri. He told me that yesterday, Tuesday, was the last day of business, and for the rest of week the schedule is staying the same so we can charge people, do returns, finish up last-minute business, etc. So that means Thursday is the very last day I'll ever spend in the place I've spent the last 4 years.  It also means, kaput, Andy is out of a job, just like that. I asked him what he was going to do next, and he has no idea. "Get another job, I guess," he said. The fact that Eddie would do all this shit, so sneaky, so quickly, and just CLOSE UP shows he's not a human being at all, but a rotten-mouthed bastard who deserves to die. Not just because we were a family business that was much loved by our customers, but because he's putting a very decent man on the streets. Goddamn.  So yeah. That's that. Say good-bye to another Boston era.  -Brennon"

       urlLink Ben  seems to be confused.  I am sorry for that.  Let me translate my spanglish:  I just think it is overkill about all this Michael Moore stuff.  I've been hearing how bad he is from you guys for a year and I am tired.  He entered the blogs, as i thought he would, but it just kept going and going and going.  Let us get back to plastic surgery comparisons.

      1.  Mary Louise Parker-the mother of billy crudup's spawn and recently dumped as well, I find her to be so beautiful that i lose all faculties.  She has been appearing in 'The West Wing' reruns lately and I can't get enough of her.    2.   urlLink Pitchforkmedia.com -what was once only a problem with mediocre writers from boston, the snooty "in-flight magazine of Air Force One", and the most revered newspaper in the US is now creeping in to pretentious internet music websites.  Is non-fiction becoming the new fiction?    3.  Euro Cup 2004-I haven't been watching a lot of soccer lately, but yesterday I caught the France/Switzerland game and I am now completely reenergized in my love for the sport.    4.  Truffles-I went out to this Italian restuarant in Larchmont Village sunday called La Luna and they had a truffle risotto.  It was love at first bite.  So delicious.    5.  Django Reinhardt-Picked up his "Django in Rome" boxset for $20 bucks at Amoeba (been meaning to since "Sweet and Lowdown") and he is a beautiful performer.  I have come to realize that I enjoy jazz when it is kept to the confines of a structured song ('When the Saints Go Marching In', 'Night and Day', 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow', etc).  I think I've finally grasped what I like about jazz and am now able to articulate that which I don't.

      My pop has been in town and i've been very lax at posting on this deliciously vulgar site.  i do have something to report though, i saw my father completely drunk for the first time in my life, with ben and tim as witnesses.  he just drank too much and i have to hold him on as i walked us home.  in this time i have realized a few things.  before this hiatus of mine is done, i will have a moustache like elliot gould's in "MASH".  and the other isi don't even know where this time has gone.  i have wasted another two months of my life on utter self-indulgence and self-denial.    i really think that i could write a little paper on "the terminal" being a modern day communist parable.  if i were so sporty that is, but i don't think that i am.  every one of you are smart enough to get it i think, but if not, let me know (or post a reply as say, "write it") and i will give it my best shot.    tomorrow pop and i will be going to see a sneak of 'collateral' which should be damn exciting.  i had him read the first draft of the script and now he can't stop talking about it.    that is my little update for now.  i hope all is well in blog town.    i shall remember that tomorrow is tuesday, the most important day in our blogging week.  i will produce the five.    happy wilco day tomorrow.  pl

      SO my fears are true.  I am not in the credits of the film.  i spent the entire movie sweating because they so nicely hand out the credit sheet at the beginning.  sweating with rage.  one person is to blame and i can't even begin to settle down at the thought of all of it.  i will not sleep.  i love and hate that movie now and all for the same reason.    life is good.

      Why must the world shat on my face and demoralize me in all the ways it can (except when it comes to jobs, friends, and family, without which i couldn't go on, so thanks for that world)? i waste so much time and so much of my efforts on things that do not matter.  my online poker addiction for one.  my incessant thoughts about girls who do not like me.  etc.  i must fill my mind with such junk for some reason that i cannot comprehend.  i wish i could date jim beam because he is nice and sweet and kind and giving and euphoric and slender and a little bit exotic due to its darker looking color and it stays with you until it dies (or you die).    i will drink what Jim has to offer me now and revel in the smokey flavor of a one night stand (minus the VDs).

      This is a lovely idea that Ben has forcibly implamented.  I'm always for expanding my horizons.     1.  Mission of Burma-just picked up their collection of EPs and OnOffOn and I must say that they are indeed a fantastic band.    2.  Homicide: Life on the Streets-Season 3 DVD set.  Brilliant writing, acting, storytelling.  3.  Roger Angell's Piece in the June 7th issue of The New Yorker (it is in the car or else i would mention the title, sorry).  I haven't been that moved by a story in a long time.   4.  Extremely fat women pornography-there's something beautiful and serene about a 250lb woman riding a man half her size.  And the options of slots to fill all over her body lets one's imagination run wild.  5.  Steve Jones's show on Indie 103.1-Good host and damn good music.

      I have immediately just finished watching the season finale of "deadwood" and i have to wonder what it must be like to be in david chase's shoes right now.  a man who knows that he started the next of hbo television but finishes his day watching the finale of "deadwood".  He had to say to himself, "my god, what beauty, what sublime determination of these characters".  milch made the show important more so that it seemed.  an allegory for humanity in present day america and all relationships.  i dare you readers to discover the show if you have not already.  it is what you hope for in a television show and what you hope for in your own lives.  Fuck the sopranos, fuck six feet under, "deadwood" is the show that makes you confuse reality with the present day.

      I'd first like to thank Ben for his crystal clear definition of film noir.  I'm sure it enlightened each and every one of you readers ("which literally means black film").  Secondly, I got a bit confused as to who was being "glib, smug, and hermetically sealed", so if someone could help me out with that...   OF COURSE THE 400 BLOWS IS BETTER THAN BARBERSHOP 2.  Listen, if you want to get all silly and shit, fine, then i will stop the discussion right now.    How was "o, Brother" an "ominous sign of what's to come"?  You are telling me you had in mind their career trajectory after seeing that film?  I highly doubt that.    I've seen one (1) preston sturges movie and that is "the lady eve".  I don't think that the coens emulate any one director or source as i have seen.  I don't seen any resemblence of "the lady eve" in raising arizona, barton fink, miller's crossing, or the big lebowski.  I do see tons of hardboiled writer's in the mix, from james m. cain to dashiell hammett (who they took the basic idea for miller's crossing from) to the one you keep mentioning ray chandler.  The "aping" of the big sleep as you say isn't nearly as aggregious as QT's prison sodomy of "city on fire".  at least they made the characters different    Here's the thing with Labute and Smith, for better or worse, they come up with their own ideas in both plot and dialogue.  QT just comes up with the dialogue.  QT has more of an aesthetic than those other two combined and to the 10th exponent, but it still doesn't change the fact that he takes more than fair amounts from other sources.    OK, i grow weary of this.  I can't form any more thoughts other than this final subjective opinion: I look forward to every new coen bros. movie with anticipation and i look forward to every new QT movie with skepticism.    I saw Chronicles of Riddick today and it was not too bad.  the production design and art direction are really impressive.  Some of the dialogue was good, but it gave no backstory to the bad dudes at all, nor even the Riddick character really.  I'd like to see what Twohy would do with the 3rd Star Wars movie.  I leave that fun thought for everyone.

      So, upon rereading a blog i put up last sunday, i've already begun my cycle of repitition.  The ever constant themes of my life.

      For anyone that actually read the paper, i must say that i missed a whole hell of a lot of subtext way back when i wrote the paper.  jean looking for a new father figure was one of them.  i could throw in freud now and play up the role switching a bit.  but i realized how un-me that paper is.  i didn't like the movie at all and i should have written why.  but i was always afraid in school of going against the professor and damning myself in to academic exile by doing so (tim understands whenever i bring up geller, and i still to this day should have pushed him in to an argument about several topics).  i guess i just noticed that i don't have any balls.  and continue not to have any in pretty much most aspects of what i do.  only unless i'm pushed to the edge do i stick up for what i believe in.  especially with women, writing, and making movies i have no confidence in any of it.  i go through things being a watcher and never really being able to articulate any of those experiences in to helping myself get better at them.  what difference does it make that i've seen all the coen bros. movies if i can't even begin to write a script myself?    i'm going to buy comic books and go to the flea market.    everyone have a rockin day,  pl

       urlLink Ben's  basic direct challenge for me to defend the recent coen bros. work is a bit grand of a task that i don't think i'm nearly eloquent enough to undertake.  But i will say a few things on the subject anyway because some cool cats think i'm not writing enough on this thing (hi dave and tom!) so i'll just say a few things.   josh's statement of tarantino as eggers is an interesting one.  with pulp fiction basically making me want to learn more about film, i have to keep it in a place close to my heart.  and with jackie brown, i found that film to be heads and tails emotionally and technically better than all his other work to date.  now, for the other stuff.  everyone knows my hatred for the kill bill double bill, so i will refrain from rehashing old matters.  but let us look at resevoir dogs.  a film whose plot is DIRECTLY ripped off from a little hong kong action film called "city on fire".  he took the exact plot of the film, and gave no credit to the original authors.  he spruced up the dialogue to make it hip and fresh.  gave it a b-movie gangster feel and made it more violent.  now, as i have not read any eggers i can only go by what you are saying his relationships with those authors are, tarantino seems to be doing the same thing.  some would say that is plagarism (in tarantino's case, it definitely is), but i guess if you've never seen the movie it doesn't really matter (which i think is what taratino is now making himself out to be a master of)  looking at where he began and where he has ended up, i'd say that he is well on his way to a downswing that i think only roger avary (a director who never really had an upswing) or someother collaborator that can reign him in from his self-indulgent and quotation (there is good quotation the scene in pulp fiction where uma draws the square on the screen and then there is bad quotation like the teaching sequences in kill bill 2) driven melange affairs that were the Bills.  what gives a director his own fingerprint/heartbeat?  in tarantino's case, it would be his dialogue.  but because he can write humorous and witty dialogue does not make him a filmmaker, it makes him a scenarist.  his camera placement and movements are nothing new or for that matter, all that interesting (the least you can say about david fincher is that he is confident with his camera) and just allow the dialogue and plot to unfold without hinderence.  josh just said to me that the most important thing about writing is structure, well what can be said when tarantino directly takes his structure from other filmmakers/writers?  you are left with 2 films that have any worth and grow positively from the mothers which birthed their origins.    I ask ben define "coen-style ingenuity" for us.   The coen bros. later works are obviously second grade material for these boys.  You failed to mention at all "o, brother where art thou?" and where it falls in the cannon of the coens.  i happen to think it falls in with the lebowski's and barton fink's.  Your statement of "I look at Intolerable Cruelty and think: good Christ in heaven why am I not watching The Lady Eve?" is lost on me as i think the only genius of preston sturges in that film is having henry fonda fall down as frequently as possible and oh my film students, look at what preston is doing.  the male is the more feeble and inept creature.  he literally can't even stand on his own two feet without the love of the woman he desires.  the woman of the film needs to come back to where she was born from.  eve must return to adam for him to be whole again...  blah.  i am posting my paper on "the lady eve" below just for fun.    the coens want desparately to have a hit.  they have abandoned, after the man who wasn't there, writing their own original scripts (for the obvious detrament to work) and started toying with other things.  i feel that they don't want to be forever those two indie guys, but people who actually made a mark in hollywood.  now, i don't feel that this is a productive goal for the two, but who can blame them, many other very talented filmmakers have tried to "sell out" (cronenberg comes to mind (yes i think he is talented, even though i don't particularly like his films) when he was very, very close to directing basic instinct 2, who thought that would have been a good idea?).  you have to give them credit for trying to succeed in a place where they are more likely going to fail.  they are making these newer movies in their own style, but with less bite.  their characterizations and camerawork still feel like their own.  my whole take on the later films is they are movies made to be movies.  in a time when "cheaper by the dozen", "bringing down the house", and "troy" are being made with reckless abandon, these quirky comedies with big stars are freshing to me.  they are offbeat, well acted, and the best shot hollywood films around.  i go in wanting to be entertained and they never fail.  they aren't the great works of the coens, but they are better works than 80% of the shit out there and i'm fine with that.  i'll go watch me some godard if i want some art, but if i want to laugh, see good acting, see pretty pictures, and be told a plain-ole good story, i'll stick with the coens every time.    Here's the paper:  Preston Sturges’s comedy “The Lady Eve” cleverly pits the beautiful con-artist Jean, against an overly matched, childlike millionaire named Charles in a battle for love.  Charles’s innocence and naiveté towards women, Jean in-particular, allows himself to be seduced by the con-artist who ultimately in the end is just as seduced by Charles.  Stanley Cavell states in his book, “Pursuits of Happiness,” that the “women of our films listen to their lecturers because they know they need to learn something further about themselves, or rather to undergo some change, or creation, even if no one knows how the knowledge and change are to arrive.”  By stating this he assumes that the women in the comedies of remarriage need the direction in their lives and the men are the ones who can hold power over the women to show them how to change.  He so much as says that the women in these remarriage comedies don’t have their lives together and need the man to tell them how to live.  Jean, in “The Lady Eve”, does not need such an education.  She is in control of Charles and her life from the first time she drops an apple on his head.  He is the one that is given the education in the film (education being punctuated by the scholarly associated apple).  The creation that comes out of the movie is Jean’s love for Charles.  But that wasn’t done through long-winded speeches or lectures from Charles, that was done by Charles just being himself.  In many of the other remarriage comedies, the man does the manipulating of events and situations, such as “The Philadelphia Story” or at the end of “It Happened One Night”.  But the character of Jean is more closely related to the Susan character in “Bringing Up Baby.”  Both women use every situation to gain some control over the man they are after.  The men in both films are always the comedic relief, with Charles falling many times and David being put into one ridiculous situation after the next.  The men seem to have no control over the women, with the women manipulating their emotions and perceptions.  Jean creates a whole new persona to prove Charles wrong and make him love her again.  Charles becomes even clumsier when Jean takes on the role of Eve.  Jean as Eve comes closer and closer to being the perfect girl in Charles’s mind, she is actually becoming farther and farther from that ideal woman he thinks he wants.  Jean’s lecture to Charles about women is more of a revelation to him and is a basic synopsis of the film as a whole.  She says, “You see Hopsy, you don’t know very much about girls.  The best ones aren’t as good as you think they are and the bad ones aren’t as bad.  Not nearly as bad.”          Jean doesn’t deviate from her original character all that much.  She is honest in the way she feels about Charles.  She knows that when she would fall in love with a man that she would have to give up her past life of conning.  This idea of her giving up her past and going straight doesn’t seem to be all that big of a step for her.  Her father had much more of a problem with it than she did.   During the first scene in the dining area, Jean shows that she is in control of the room.  Cavell equates her with a director of a film.  She is writing the scenarios, making up stories for other ladies, and using her pocket mirror as a camera she films all of it in her own little movie.  Sturges gives Jean the power in this scene.  She is aware of so much more aware of what is going on around Charles than he is.  The audience can see right away that she is cunning when it comes to men and Charles is very naïve when it comes to women.  Near the end of this scene, as Charles gets up to walk away, she says, “Go soak your head and see if I care.”  She says it as if by blowing off all of the women, she too is being blown off.  She then trips him and puts him to the ground where spends many moments during the film.  He walks up to her, trying to be manly and forceful, but very quickly is diminished to an apologetic wimp.  She immediately takes charge of their relationship. She has the ability to make him fall, either in love with her or to the ground; it’s all in her hands as the director. The next scene takes place in her cabin and continues to flaunt her sexuality over the innocent Charles.  The shot goes from an eye level shot of Charles above Jean, to a tilt now showing Charles on his knee putting Jean’s shoe on her foot, with Jean framed staring down at Charles.  Then he is completely intoxicated by her and is shaken.  He has lost control of his body even.  He tries to kiss her in the middle of his “cockeyed” reaction to her perfume.  If Jean were really trying to take advantage of Charles like a sucker, she would have given in to his kiss.  But Jean talked about the future with Charles; she hinted at it.  When he told her about his nickname of Hopsy, she said when you get older I can call you Popsy.  She’s fallen as much for him as he has for her.  The editing of the scene also promotes the idea that they are mutually falling for one another.  At first Charles is in a soft-focus close-up, but the last shot before the two get up to leave, is a shot of Jean looking longingly at Charles’s face.  Nevertheless, he is still the naïve one.  He is so naïve up until he is shown proof that Jean and her father are con-artists, he thinks that he is the more experienced one at cards and he also makes a few comments that try and correct her way of speaking.  She lets him feel superior, but she knows that she always has the upper hand.  Where he lives in the moment, she is looking around the corner at the future.   After running scared from Charles’s room back to hers, Jean plays the frightened woman needing a man’s protection.  But she soon takes over the scene once again and gives her lecture to Charles about her ideal man.  With Charles on the ground next to the chair below her, Jean takes his head into her arms and says, “Don’t let me go.”  But he never does any of the holding, its all her.  She means this phrase in a larger sense.  She means never to let her go again as a couple.  She gently strokes his hair while he stares off holding back his growing arousal for her.  He’s so enamoured and sexually provoked by her that he can hardly speak.  During this long take, his eyes never really go towards Jean.  He is almost holding himself back by not looking at her.  She knows that she has him at this point and that she doesn’t want to let him go.  This scene feels as if it goes on and on because there are no cuts or any camera movement at all.  Just the two people sharing this moment of finding the people they’ve been looking for.  When she says she’s looking for a short wealthy man, she is talking about Charles, since he spends most of his time on the ground and looking up at her.  The shot cuts to a close up of the actors’ faces pushed close to one another in the frame.  He’s shorter than she is in scenes because of the way the Sturges films them.  Sturges uses the composition of the shot to give power to Jean.  She is framed domineering over Charles in many instances, always higher in the frame looking down at him and him up towards her.     Cavell states, “What our films show is that in the world of film if the woman’s real father exists, he is never on the side of this father figure but, on the contrary, actively supports the object of her true desire, that is, the man she is trying, and trying not, to leave.”  In the case of “The Lady Eve”, Jean is looking for a man the exact opposite of her father.  As she describes what she doesn’t want in a man to Charles, she describes her father, as he appears the next night at the card rematch.  She is looking for something better in her life.  Although she loves her father very much, she can’t help but realize that what she is doing isn’t what she actually wants to do with her life.  The innocence that comes from Charles is what draws her to him and makes her fall in love with him. When she says she wouldn’t want her ideal to do “card tricks”, she means the real card tricks her father does, not the simple ones Charles knows.  The father can’t help but dislike Charles because he is naïve, rich, and the exact opposite of himself.  He’s everything that Harry takes advantage of in a mark.  He would be happier if Jean were with someone more along the lines of himself.  She’s looking for Charles to take her away, off into the sunset, and live happily ever after.  Jean’s epiphany comes early on in the film.  She decides that to make sure that Charles can love her, she is going to go straight.  She makes this decision without any involvement from Charles, who doesn’t even know she’s a con-artist yet.  He hasn’t asked anything of her yet, and she knows that she has to go on the “up and up” in order for him to accept her as his bride.  This does not come from any lecture by a man; she even stands up to the one-person dear to her and that is her father.   Jean’s transformation into Eve is her ultimate play of power.  Again we see her as if she intends to do harm, which she rightly might do, but in the end she uses her power over Charles to gain his love back.  It seems as though she’s going to uncaringly enter his life, but after his first fall over the couch, she becomes that motherly watcher over him and falls back in love with him again.  She picks the food off of his tuxedo and sticks up for him when his father pokes fun at him.  She says, “You go take a bath and I’ll like you just as much as ever.”  Basically saying, she’s going to love him again, but not until she proves to him that Jean was perfect for him and not Eve.  Eve shows Charles how perfect a girl can be.   How she meets all of his desires and wishes, she even gets him to repeat his speech that he told Jean.  Jean/Eve play it out exactly the same way, only this time its meant serve as a punishment and an eye opener.  Embarrassment after embarrassment comes to Charles, brought upon by the director.  Sturges is directing these scenes like Jean directed the opening scene in the dining area on the ship.  While Jean is acting like Eve, Sturges is directing all the follies that Jean would want to happen Charles to treat him like the jerk he had been to her.  As to where Charles had the power over all the women in the dining room on the ship, Eve now has the power over his own household.  Nothing is as perfect as Charles would like it to be in this half of the story.  The tables have turned upon him and he should have taken Jean’s advice about women.   Cavell’s statements about the comedies of remarriage don’t necessarily pertain to his analysis of “The Lady Eve.”  The film revolves around the power held by Jean and lost, but then regained during her transformation into Eve.  Jean is strong and in control of what she wants, never needing a lecture from Charles to show her how to live her life so that they can be the perfect couple.  Charles is the one that is in need of a lecture, and if he had taken the advice that Jean had given him, he would not have needed to be taught the harsh lesson that Eve taught him.  Cavell also says that father will side with the first love, but in Harry’s case, he thinks of Charles as a fool asking to be taken.  Charles does not spout lines or lectures to Jean or Eve about change, if anything, Jean shows Charles that she was right all along and that her advice was the best advice he could have ever gotten.  She’s goes even so far as to prove herself right and have him running back to her at the end, so she can live happily ever after with the man she loves.  Just the way she planned from the beginning.    Now I ask you, how could such a poorly written paper mean anything but my utter unenjoyment of watching and having to analyze this film.

       urlLink Tim's  recent post of my comments was both fun and educational.  I think larry was just pointing out the fact that the white boys he was playing had no game compared to the brothers and even only a few of the brothers could possibly keep him in front of them (as tim pointed out).   i see now why tim posted his original comments and i took them in the wrong context.  i believe that i actually agree with him now, but i still get humor out of his statement because well, there aren't too many of white players left that can say that they schooled the best of the best (which i think during the times that larry, magic, kareem, isaiah, barkley, etc. will be the best players the league has seen (and i guess i'll just say, ever) until they get over this hip-hop bullshit influence (is that racist of me?) of jacking the ball 30 times and putting in 10 of them and getting 2 assists when you are a point guard).  maybe the new european influence will force americans to start actually playing the game of basketball, but i can only hope.  i used to hate on tony parker, but he's turned in to a great little point guard that actually plays the game and he's fucking french.  who in the world would have thought a frenchman could play ball???    as far as the parcels thing goes, well, he's dumb, but hysterical.    i guess i just take the don rickles point of view on racial slurs and say who the fuck cares.  people are people and if someone calls you a jap, call him a fat honkey right back instead of making him apologize.  maybe he'll learn his lesson that way and maybe both parties can have a good laugh at the end of the day.  thats all from this wop, dago, greaseball

      I sit here now in just my underwear in my bed a bit hungover.  last night i drank too much.  although i did not black out like usual, which is very positive.  i definitely called a girl i knew and said things i should not have said (an old girl, not the one who looks after children).  but that is usual for me after a night of drinking; to wake up in embarrasment at acts done the night before.  i haven't drank like that in a long while and it felt good.  not good like sex good, but good in the general good sense.  my body aches and my head is spinning, and i raise my water glass in toast to the greatest margarita ever concocted.    here, here.

      I put these thoughts on here now because i am bored.  as bored as i usually get on a sunny saturday afternoon with nothing really to do.  but is there nothing to do?  there is not nothing to do, but plenty to do.  i say all the time that i want to write and tell stories, but i don't do shit to push that forward.  nothing but make little notes and scribbles, i don't think i've even used final draft in months.  so what the hell is my point of being out here, of doing anything in this industry, if basically all i do is watch.  i've become a bystander in nearly all aspects of everything i do.  i sick back, take in information and for what?  who cares if i've seen a gazillion movies, if i've read tons of books, if i've seen all of "twin peaks".  none of that matters unless i can put it to good use.  how has watching that show made me any better at what i want to do?  how is sitting here watching "nypd blue" making me any better at being a "writer"?  it isn't.  it just keeps me from being someone who could do any of that stuff.  i often think that maybe i could right in a vaccuum.  if i was put in prison, could i just use that time to write all day.  i don't think i'd even do it then.  i'd find some excuse, some fucking way to make it ok that i don't do anything.  i write on this new excuse (the one right before "my eyes are too dry" and right after "well i have a movie to go do").  so i guess that is about all.  maybe smarty jones will win the triple crown and maybe he won't.  either way, i won't have written a damn thing today.    see i can put in some sort of news worthy event after all.

      Hello, This is my blog.  I can't say that i will stay away from what some of my contemporaries would say is a "diary" writing style, but i shall try to keep my day-to-day habits interesting if they shall ever come to be put on here.    My reason for starting one was at the urgings of Mr. Brown and his accomplice Mr. Teal at dinner last night.  And today speaking to Mr. Pink I figured, Why the fuck not?    So here it is.  I not a current events dude like the rest of you monkeys, but I'll try to keep up with my own musings and hopefully they'll be found interesting by at least one other person.  Because if you reach just one fan, then it has all been worth it.

      I'm reading this book right now and I'm digging it.  I came upon this passage that I thought was quite good.  "The terrible predicament of a beautiful girl is that only an experienced womanizer, someone cynical and without scruples, feels up to the challenge.  More often than not, she will lose her virginity to some filthy lowlife in what proves to be the first step in an irrevocable decline."  It just struck me as well observed.

      After last weeks let down of a column, I'm hoping to come back strong with this week's picks.  I've had some fruitful experiences to pull from so I hope you all enjoy!   1.  Kim Basinger's performance in "The Door in the Floor"-i found the movie to be really enjoyable.  the tone is all over the place, but i kind of got why.  it was too messy to be done without purpose and i thought it excentuated the deconstruction of all the relationships within the story.  Jeff Bridges is fantastic  and the kid who plays his assistant is a good straight character.  But Kim Basinger gets props for her courageousness.  She allows herself to be bent over the end of a bed, completely naked, getting it from behind by this young kid.  What happened to the Kim Basinger that used a body double during "9 1/2" weeks?  I like this new one a whole lot better.  Round of applause to another fine older woman bearing it all.    2.  The first 5 minutes of "She Hate Me" (after the credits)-while the movie drags on and spike takes on any topic that seemingly jumped in to his head while writing the picture, these first 5 minutes have 2 of the best shots in cinema so far this year that last together, maybe, 10 seconds.  Spike assaults the viewer for the rest of the movie with what is a modern family, who are the real criminals in the US, the malleability of sexual orientation, and of course, the black man's role in all of this.  Come for the first 5 minutes, stay for the girl on girl action.    3.  "The Throes" Two Gallants-I've probably mentioned them to almost everyone by now, but I'm going to write it on here just in case I missed a few of you.  http://www.twogallants.com  Yea, it is amazing stuff.  Please check out the two MP3s they have up on the page.  Well worth the time and the album is well worth your money.  Smart, beautiful storytelling.    4.  Greg Rucka- a great comic book writer ("Queen and Country", "Gotham Central") who i had the pleasure to meet at Comic-Con 2004 this past saturday.  He was the first person who's booth i went up to and in all the excitement i forgot how to spell my name.  It took me a good minute or two to figure it out.  If i ever thought i wasn't a nerd, i was brought back to the harsh reality that i am indeed indubitably a nerd.  One that felt a kinship and belonging to all the people that donned costumes for the convetion.    5.  Kevin Connolly-plays Eric in HBO's continually underwhelming "Entourage".  I don't know why, but i think he does a great job with such a shitty part.  he seems the most at ease of all the cast (and maybe i end up liking him because of the situation he's in:  saddled next to truly awful actors plaing truly awful characters).  i'd like to see him given a good part.  he wasn't bad in "John Q" (another awful mess).  I dunno.  I will continue  to watch the show to see if they can get a new writer or 2 in there and give  these characters something more to do.

        You're Sean! You're the resident bad-boy at Degrassi High. You did have trouble with authority in the past, but now you just get a bad rep because of your apperance. You're known to be short tempered and pick fights quite often. A lot of this anger is because of your absent parents, who are no longer around because their abusing some kind of substance. When it comes to your girlfriend Emma though, you have an incredibly sweet side. You'd do anything for your loved one. You're convinced you're a screw-up, but people around you know that you're not. Believe them when they say they really care. You hang mostly with Craig, and used to with Jimmy until you two got into a fight...then another one...then another one...this even caused you to lose someone you love, although you did get them back.

      1. Borat-the best of the 3 characters Sacha Baron Cohen inhabits during the hysterical "Da Ali G Show". Whether he's wrestling AA baseball players in the locker room, getting white southerners to admit casually that they aren't better off without slaves, or getting acting tips from James Lipton, he never ceases to please.   2. AllMusic.com-yes it is loading slow lately, but I'm sure it will be fixed shortly. I remember going to that site and thinking to myself, "this place is amazing, every band you can imagine, bios, reviews, cross-referencing, the works, but i wish i could hear some samples from some of the bands. that would make this the greatest site ever!" well, my prayers are answered.   3. Double Stuff Oreo Cookies-i think they are fucking crack-goddamn-cocaine.&nbsp; It seems like there is an endless supply of these treats, no matter where i turn, double stuff.&nbsp;   4.&nbsp; "Lost" series by J.J. Abrams & Damon Lindelof- after reading the first three episodes and am now just sitting down to watch the pilot, this show is going to kick everyone's ass.&nbsp; Very similar in concept to "Earth 2", except on a deserted island and not another planet or in the future, the show contains so many "oh-my-god" moments and "jesus christ" turns you can't help but be riveted.&nbsp; Seeing who was cast in the show and then reading the scripts made it even better.&nbsp; Brilliant all around.&nbsp;   5.&nbsp; Putting speakers in my bedroom to connect to my Mini-iPod-almost a substitute to having a girl in bed with me.&nbsp; I forgot what a joy it is to listen to music in the dark late at night.&nbsp;   *Sigh* I was getting really antsy at work and the thought of doing the 5 things was seriously messing my head up and I wasn't in a happy place.&nbsp; Apologies to all those I have offended for not completely my 5.&nbsp; The show must go on and I realize this now.&nbsp;   Does the completion of this list mean Tim now has to adjust his 5?&nbsp;   urlLink  &nbsp; The stock market has been over 10k for a while now, so that isn't quite news.&nbsp; Most female singers should only have their mouths open for me to stick my cock in.&nbsp; Nick Cannon will be the next Denzel Washington in a few years.&nbsp; If Martha Stewart ever needs a conjugal visit while in lockdown, I'll be the first in line.&nbsp; Sandy Berger...well I don't quite have the wit to make a fun joke about him, but who the fuck names their kid Sandy besides the fucking Alomars?&nbsp; Who would ever have wanted a head of the CIA named Sandy?&nbsp; I would put more comics down but I don't think anyone would give them a chance and that is really why i would put them down there.&nbsp; Like if i said Kurt Busiek's "Arrowsmith" is one of the best things I've read all year, no one would probably go check it out (see my "Sleeper" metion in  urlLink http://poisonville.blogspot.com/2004/06/five-people-id-like-to-meet-in-heaven_28.html#comments &nbsp;5 People entry).&nbsp; So that kind of depresses me.&nbsp; I'm kind of cranky today as i stayed up and listened to goddamn music all night cause i'm a fucking idiot.&nbsp;

      One episode of "deadwood" nominated and it is the pilot??  Granted, I love the pilot.  Got me in to the show, but that Ricky Jay Episode was the meaning of perfection in a one hour drama.  Drunken monologue, love stories galore, flim-flammery, it had it all.    4 episodes of the sopranos?  Horseshit.  In should have been flipped like Adrianna (although good for Drea's nomination, she did a great job).  Mind you, it is a good show, but as i've said time and time again, episode for episode, deadwood hands down beat up on the sopranos.  no, not beat up, but killed slowly, with a saw and hatchet, piece by piece.    David Chase was sitting in his mohagony chair this morning, in the terrycloth white robe the cast and crew got him for a wrap gift, watching the nominations for best writing in a dramatic series thnking to himself, "Damnit, the only way i could have won is if they nominated anything but "Deadwood".  I will lose, the house bets are on me, but damn it, i'm going to lose.  I'll get you david milch, i'll get you good..."  Also, I might like to point out that Ian McShane got no nomination.    Congrats to my new co-workers though, mr. garber and ms. garner.    I guess any awards show that posthumously gives the "modern day charlie chaplin" a nod can't be that bad.    There's still the golden globes I guess, the only real awards show left.  yea, i said it, what?

      I'd first like to point out that URBY was the only person to post a blog today.  Not even Josh came through.     And the nominees are...   1.   urlLink www.suicidegirls.com -urby knows my feelings on this site, as he shares them, so, damn, some of these chicks are so fuckin' sexy.    2.  MTV2's Subterranean-the last bastion of good music and good videos on the Jewbox.  Smartly added to an encore showing at 11pm on Monday evenings after I wrote several angry letters when it was just on at 9pm on sundays.  did not go with my schedule one bit.    3.  PJ Harvey "The Letter"-I don't normally like female singers (Beth Gibbons, Emily Haines, the chick from The Detroit Cobras, the girl from Fiery Furnaces (new album out tomorrow for them, get it bitches), and maybe Hope Sandoval, and Nico depending on the song, but that is really it, oh and Karen O of YYYs, shit i guess my list is expanding, a year ago it was just Beth Gibbons), but i'm gonna jump on her long ago band wagon and say that she can sing a damn fine song.      4.  Thumbing through one of my classics books today I came upon this (stick with me, it is a long one, but worth it i think):  I who once wrote songs with joyful zeal Am driven by grief to enter weeping mode. See the Muses, cheeks all torn, dictate, And wet my face with elegiac verse. No terror could discourage them at least From coming with me on my way. They were the glory of my happy youth And still they comfort me in hapless age. Old age came suddenly by suffering sped, And grief then bade her government begin: My hair untimely white upon my head, And I a worn out bone-bag hung with flesh. Death would be blessing if it spared the glad But heeded invocations from the wetch. But now Death's ears are deaf to hopeless cries, His hands refuse to close poor weeping eyes. While with success false Fortunes favoured me One hour of sadness could not have thrown me down, But now her trustless countenance has clouded, Small welcome to the days that lengthen life. Foolish the friends who called me happy then: For falling shows a man stood insecure.   I'm not going to say where it comes from.  I just thought it was beautiful.  It has been floating through my head all evening.    5.   urlLink www.OneLook.com -Possibly my favorite website.  Definitely the most useful to me as I find myself looking up a word every minute it seems.  Someone should make a toolbar that links this site and stick it on Explorer.  I'd be one happy illiterate, sumbitch.

      1.  World Series of Poker Coverage on ESPN-leave it to ESPN to turn this game in to an on-going series.  Making every sucker in America think that they can win the title.  "Only in America!"  2.  Pizza Hut Stuffed Crust Pizza w/ Pepperoni-that cheese on the ends is most definitely not cheese, but damn does is it delicious.  Especially being about as hungover as possible.    3.   urlLink Hunter S. Thompson's  infrequent, but often hilarious column for Espn Magazine.  Read through the archives and waste a few hours.    4.  "Add It Up" by Violent Femmes-well, I don't really know what to say other than this song is about as sexually angsty as you can get and I am sexually angsty, so do the math.  Maybe it was because I saw "Before Sunset" and I was reminded by the 90s (and 2004) genius of Ethan Hawke.   5.  David Bekerman-for getting me to write the first real page of script in about a year or so.  Thanks homes.

      I'm 9/10ths down with this beautifully delicious bottle i bought.  it is so pretty.  it is wrapped in straw and the taste is very smooth.  today was a good day.  i haven't had a good day in a while.  i really needed one.  and by a good day, i mean a good day all around.  in the work front, in the girl front (oh yes, i might actually have a fucking date, it would be my first real one in like a year), and i saw "before sunset"  which yea yea yea yea yea, some people say the first one is boring, two people talking, nothing going on...i say to them that they have no soul.  not in a passive way, but in the way that pedophiles and Joshua have no soul.  this one is BETTER.  yes, i said it, BETTER!!!! than the first one.  it is beautiful, lyrical, moving, touching, frustrating, etc all in one little movie.  i want to laugh with joy as having seen it and be happy that two fictional characters are alive on screen in ways i haven't been witness to in a long while.    so drink up on this 3rd (and for some of you fellow bloggers 4th) of july.  i am happy.  and i haven't been able to say that in a while.  and it is only possible because of the land of the free and the home of the brave.    fireworks show in my pants soon to follow.  g'night!

      1. Box Office Poison by Alex Robinson-if there were a modern version of Reality Bites NYC-style in book form that gave you the feelng that Tarantino talked about a little while back when refering to Dazed and Confused (of just watching a movie to be with old friends that you can just hang out with anytime you put it on) it would be this graphic novel. It is epically long, naturally written, smart, honest, and funny.  On a side note, I see that Ben put "Blankets" in his "i'm reading this now" section and i don't know whether it was on my urging or not, but good choice. I also noticed that you had "The Watchmen" up there as well. What did you think? Or do you think if you are still reading it? Have you gotten to it yet Tim?  2. Neil Patrick Harris-he and Kim Basinger win my Celebrities with the Biggest Stones awards for the year (at least so far). NPH goes balls out and gives one of the funniest performances of the year as his muff loving self in "Harold and Kumar Go to Whitecastle" Kumar or Harold: (it doesn't matter) Do you like burgers? NPH: Yea, muff burgers.  3. David Holmes/The Free Association's Soundtrack for "Code 46"-reminiscent combination of Air's and Kevin Shields's film work, they create an immediate mood to every scene that matches the elliptical tone poetry being presented on screen. Now if only godspeed you! black emperor would do a score...  4. ESPN-for reasons that both make me elated and simultaneously depressed, Sportscenter is going "Old School" this week and bringing back all the great anchors from the past. My question is WHY ARE THESE THE ANCHORS OF THE PAST???? Charlie Steiner this morning was fantastic, Kilborn yesterday was back to his old, wry, self-absored ways, and I can't wait for the rest of the guests this week. If i were Linda Cohn, Scott Van Pelt, Steve Brithueme(or however the fuck you spell his name) etc, i would be embarrassed to call myself a Sportscenter anchor after watching the real men do it (and i mean men because let's face it, women presenting sports is just AWFUL).  4.5-"The League" commercial on ESPN. "You keyed my car!" says creepy blonde guy. "But it's The League" replies his nerdy friend. "The League..." Hysterical everytime i watch it.  5.  Figueroa Cafe-i went here for a drink type thing and the place is beautiful.  drinks aren't that expensive and they have nice chips and salsa.  i'm so drunk right now that i don't have anything else to say, but it is nice.  i was going to put something really profound, but now it turns in to a drunken mess.  Maybe something can beat it this week,  but probably not.  i don't understand why girls have to leave town.  and then you are stuck here with girls IN town and it is not quite as good.  i need to have sex people.  this is just pathetic.

      "I've been given to understand that The Big Twist at the end of M Night Shyalaman's THE VILLAGE is that The Monsters In The Woods are in fact the entire production staff of Touchstone Pictures, gathered in a big circle and laughing at you for paying to watch a seventy-three-hour-long movie full of slumming actors brooding a lot just for the last three minutes, and then realising that you can never see the movie again, because you only really wanted the last three minutes and the rest of the thing was fucking awful.  In other news, the report that Mr. Shyalaman burst into his parents' room in their dying moments and yelled "Surprise! I was a little alien girl all along and your real baby was shoved into a paper shredder by a drunken nurse! It's THE BIG TWIST AT THE END!" is entirely false and was possibly fabricated by this writer over a large glass of aquavit."

       urlLink     1.)  The Elementary Particles  by Michel Houellebecq- I published a quote from the book a little bit ago and I just finished it this afternoon. This book is amazing. Josh, you would love this puppy. I want to say so much about it, but then I don't want to ruin anything because going in to it with no idea what you are about to undertake is so damn rewarding.     2.)  Blankets  by Craig Thompson- I'd post a picture of the cover but I can't figure out a goddamn thing on this fucking thing. I can only put one picture at a time in a post. Someone needs to teach me what the fuck I'm doing wrong. Anyway, this graphic novel just won 2 Eisner Awards for Best Graphic Novel of Original Work and Best Writer/Artist. A beautiful first love story that I think anyone and everyone can relate to.   3.) "Astral Glamour" The Homosexuals- with a name like that you'd wonder why they weren't on the charts in the early 80s. Purposely naming themselves that because they didn't want mainstream success, this deconstructionist punk band sounded 30 years ahead of their time. This collection contains all their recordings.   4.) Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard in "Garden State"- Natalie Portman is radiant and Sarsgaard is as laid back and perfect as he usually is. I can't say enough about these two in this movie.   5.) Running- I never thought I'd say it, but I kind of look forward to a little job when I get home from work now and then. Slip on the headphones and move my legs until want to pass out.    Bonus Person in Heaven This Week:   Dave Chappelle -this motherfucker just got a $50,000,000 contract to make a whopping 20 Episodes in 2 years. $2.5 Million an Episode. $113636.36363636363636363636363636 per Minute. "I'm rich, Biatch!" indeed.

      I knew HBO was smart.  I didn't think they were going to pick a stinker in this Entourage business.  Larry Charles shows up to write tonight's third episode and the show almost instantly became fun, sexy, dirty, and maybe even smart.  Instead of being a Sex and the City with guys, it is this weird Seinfeld spawn.  I hope it continues in this direction with more established talent writing the show and less of whoever wrote those first two episodes.  Ben, Tim, you can recommence watching the show.  Catch it this week on reruns.  You'll enjoy it a lot more than the last two (i know that isn't saying much, but give it a shot).

      This afternoon I took the opportunity to catch Zach Braff's "Garden State".  I had some trepidation about checking out the flick.  1.  it is written, directed, and starring a tv actor from a mildly funny sitcom which made it seem to be like, "boy, i'm mildly famous, i can make a movie with my actor buddies".  2.  it seemed like it was going to be melodramatic and at the same time have this quirkiness to it to make it "hip".   Both of my early assesments were completely wrong.  The flick is a little gem.  By no means perfect and I still have a problem with Braff starring in the film, but it has a great cast (the nearly always perfect Peter Sarsgaard and a really radiant Natalie Portman stepping it up a notch.  It is strange too because it seems like Portman's character is the older version of several of her old roles combined).  I would check it out if you have an afternoon to spare and want to just go see a good little movie.

       urlLink    As i am watching the cubs game on wgn, this commerical comes on that is reminiscent of these new stroke commercials, where this woman comes on and says shes a burden.  so this one is of a dude who sounds like said stroke victim, except they cut to him licking his wife's handheld mixer when it turns on and his tongue gets stuck.  hilarious.  cut to dq showing what the brownie batter blizzard loks like and i think i fell in love.
