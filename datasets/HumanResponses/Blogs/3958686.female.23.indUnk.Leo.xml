      I moved to my new place, it's temporary albeit more permanent than the places where I have been staying. In the past I'd have been more than thrilled to be living here. The place is full of European boys one more handsome than the last. I wonder if I still have a thing for European boys, I think that died somewhere. I don't know what's going on with me-- I just don't feel like socializing at all. I don't eat dinner here, I stay in my room and continue exploring the city on my own. Maybe this bit of anti-social behavior will end, but do I want it to? Also, everyone already knows me as the Rwandan girl (grrr).   I overheard this lady that I work with, Carolyn, talking behind my back. I don't know why she thought she was talking behind my back because she's so fucking loud. She said that "the new girl is bougie and think she white." HA! I've never heard that before. In any case this woman is straight up ghetto and for me to describe someone that way, you know it must be bad.   I went to a naughty store alone for the first time yesterday. I've only been twice- once with Jamie and the other time with my ex-boyfriend Jeff ( we were so embarrassed and blushed like the virgins we were). I didn't buy anything.

      "Mastering and Butling" [excerpt]  by Chris Lee  Blackbook Spring 2004   You couldn't blame him for feeling nervous. Nearly $2 million was riding on the race, a sum payable to Sean "P. Diddy" Combs' charity, Diddy Runs the City, upon the hip-hop mogul's completion of the New York Marathon. But moments before the 26.2-mile race was set to begin, performance anxiety wasn't his only problem. According to a widely read New York Post item last November, Combs heard nature's call, and was either unwilling or unable to give up his place in the line to visit a porta-a-potty.   Enter Farnsworth Bentley, Diddy's flamboyant manservant, a guy often photographed wearing pink three-piece suits and holding a large umbrella over the Bad Boy CEO. This time, however, the rapper-turned-marathon man had a different request. He needed something to piss in-- bad-- and so he sent his butler scampering off. In no time flat, Bentley, né Derek Watkins, a Morehouse College graduate with a rumored million-dollar salary, returned with a make shift latrine: a plastic Ziploc bag. Problem solved.

      I started my job at the Smithsonian yesterday. It's really easy and I don't do much of anything. This has its benefits and down falls. I'll name of each: benefit being that I can pretty much read all day as there is not much to do. Downfall being that I need to move on fast because this job will not pad my résumé.   The conversation that is going on behind me reminds me how lazy I have been in my pursuit of my "career." At the hostel, Czech guy having a conversation with Japanese roommate in Japanese. Why is it that I am only truly fluent in English? I had so many opportunities and let them go by the way side because of lack of money ( a convenient excuse). I guess my goals need to me more long term, but I see the err of my ways and I have time to rectify the mistakes that I have made.   Money is fast becoming a problem as I have not yet been paid for the work I did in the past weeks. I called my Mum to tide me over but she's in the middle of nowhere and I must wait. Why is it that I always&nbsp;wait until things are fucked up to ask for help? Damn, that African pride!   &nbsp;I read a book called  The Accidental Diva .&nbsp; I must preface: I do not own this book, I borrowed it from the lady I work with. She likes what I call Romance novels-- I say this because she gave me two choices but said the other one was "kinda nasty." She held up the cover to reveal a man and a woman in an embrace, the man looking longingly in the woman's&nbsp;eyes-- yeah, nasty. I will not say much about  The Accidental Diva , but I will say that it's amazing to see the kind of rubbish that gets published these days. This is a story about a bougie girl from the south who falls in love with a "thug" from the "ghetto." This book is full of references to Jimmy Choos and Marc Jacobs, so much so that it can be mistaken for an advertisement. Well, it goes without mentioning that the woman who wrote this book is&nbsp;a beauty&nbsp;editor and it reads more like a fashion magazine than a novel. I also just read and article in  Blackbook  entitled "When asskissing became networking," I guess that's all it come down to: connections. Those without connections, no matter how talented they are stand no chance.&nbsp;My friend, Steve is an amazing writer, he has been writing for years and is unpublished. My ex-boyfriend (who shall remain unnamed) his alcohol and drug-induced rants litter the internet. It's not fair, but I guess in the end, if we were asked in a hundred years the writers we remember from our time, the likes of Steve would quickly come to mind.

      I had a conversation with my sister yesterday and we ended up arguing the meaning of the word "homeless." I have not had a steady place to&nbsp;live for the past two months. I have HAD a place to sleep, but it has been in sleeping bags, hotels, hostels, my mum's house and the like. I am not in need of anything, I am not deprived and I am not hungry. But am I homeless in the sense that I have no place to call home? It's so nice to have a place to call your own and right now I dream about the bed I'll buy when things straighten out-- all puffy and comfortable.  &nbsp;  I start my new job at the Smithsonian tomorrow....

      I moved to Washington DC as of a week and a half ago. I came here wanting to leave Texas, a place I have reluctantly called home for the past ten years. I have been living from hostel to hostel and have not yet secured permanent housing. The past few weeks have been very enlightening to say the least. I didn't think myself naïve by any means, but when I realized that I was seeing my first housing project at 22 I was proven otherwise. I grew up in Africa and walking past a dead body happened on more than one occasion, but I didn't realize to the lengths I've been sheltered in the United States.  &nbsp;  The city itself is beautiful and I think I'll really like it here. I do have a few complaints however.  1. DC doesn't know good music. Most recently I was living in Austin, TX and no establishment, I don't care which, would be caught dead playing Vanessa Carlton or Dashboard Confessional. No travel guide would tell you about tonights big concert: Eve 6. Ever!  2. Who are these young people all dressed up and shit? Where are they going? What are they dressed up to do?  3. What's the rush?   I was watching I love the 90s earlier this evening, I caught the 1993 episode. 1993 is known for many things, but famously, or infamously, as the year that Lorena Bobbitt chopped off the penis of her philandering husband. Most of the women on the panel thought he deserved it. When this occurred I was 12 thought this woman crazy, at 22 I think that every woman should be allowed to do this to one of the men in her past. God knows this would keep them in line.
