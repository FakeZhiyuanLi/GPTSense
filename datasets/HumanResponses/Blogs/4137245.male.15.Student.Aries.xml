          So Brendan Chan comes up to me the other day and tells me how he's "annoyed with the melody that the jazz combo plays."  I guess you have to play the music to understand Monk.  Plus he told me that he liked certain solos that I did and hated some.  It's nice to hear opinions coming from lamens so I know what the average people think of my solos.  But I really dont pay attention to their suggestions cause...well....they can't blow.  I know what sounds good and what doesn't and i have really sucked on all of my solos that i've done.  Them blues are the hardest changes to master.     Me and my dad went to listen to these two cats at Luna last night, and man could they blow.  It was the second time they have giged at Luna.  They played thier own Originals last night so we were kinda dissapointed.  We should have came to their first appearance.....thats when they blew some Blue Note Standards out of their horn.  Anyways they were still awesome, and the drummer knew how to play.  He didn't do any of that rock beat crap, and his dynamics didn't overpower the combo.(Unlike most drummers i know)----The two horns were both Tenor saxophonists from the Air Force Band of the West, but unfortunately the highest rank they can be is a seargant.  PFFFFFFFFFT!!!!!! They both sounded like Trane.  Thats always good!      After listening to those guys last night, something clicked and I just became so angry.  When it was time to solo over Straight, No Chaser(Combo Song/Fundamental Drill) i ripped that thing up.  I felt like Cannonball.  They were great.  They still weren't what i want my solos to be like, but it certainly improved.       It realy sucks to play jazz outside in the sun sweating, but as long as I can bring the sounds of Cannonball alive...its worth it!  Cario Out

      Whats their to say about August 5th?   August 5th  Heard the drumline today-too bad they cant do that during the show-jk but seriously-they seem to get off beat alot...cant they hear it? Maybe im just too picky?  Today me and james spent some quality time practicing for All State Jazz--yeah thats right, Jazz. Ive got a lot of problems with the way society views Jazz.  I asked a lot of people what their take on jazz is.....most people said that it involves a lot of bending notes and swinging_______________________________TOTTALLY WRONG ANSWER!!  Anyways im sorry for ranting but people just dont seem to get it.  Pop artists, rock and "rollers", and other music genres dont take much talent--and yet they get paid the most.  Jazz is probably the most difficult music to understand and create and they still dont get any respect.  Seriously whens the last time you heard a jazz artist being featured at the Grammys?  Its all bout the looks nowdays..not the music.  Did anybody by any chance catch the Grammy's this year?  Chick Corea with the Foo Fighters? WTF!!!! And not to mention that all of the jazz awards were announced before the actual Grammy Telecast.  Really Lame!  Im not saying that you should pay all your money to support Jazz artists, but what i am saying is to give them some respect.    Oh yeah, and when jazz musicians play in a combo and solo, they are making that stuff off the top of their head---most people (lamens) dont know that!  And Kenny G is not a Jazz artist------he is a smooth jazz artist....big difference.
