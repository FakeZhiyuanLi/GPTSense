      Well, this week has gone by fast and I haven't blogged in a while. So this is what happened this week. I finally took my written permit test and passed easily. The next day I finished my drive times and recieved my permit. That's basically benn my week. Today I'm driving my parents to return a vacuem cleaner to a store. Fun fun.

      Unfortunately, I had no time to blog yesterday as I was over at my friends house. In the morning we went on a bikeride all through Berwick. When we returned I played Nightfire on his X-Box and noticed something: the game looks exactly like the other versions. It even has the same texture's, although they are slightly enhanced. The other games didn't have astounding graphics either. So, is the X-Box overhyped in the graphics department? One thing is certain, screenshots of X-Box games look better than the games themselves.

      That's today right? Yah it is. Anyway, I got up at 8:00 and then went to the track. I ran really hard for one minute then ran at a slow pace. I did this for half an hour. Then I went home, took a shower and did some chores. After swimming at my neighbors I came in and used the computer. This has been one boring day.

      Well, yesterday was Sunday so I did the usual: went to church, pigged out at my Grandmas, watched T.V., went home, and finished off the day by watching the Olympic tryouts. Just to let you know, my Grandma is an awesome  cook.

      New bands usually sound the same. It's a fact. So why would a band choose to sound like another band from long ago? Because then they don't sound like any other bands from 2004. Enter Secret Machines. Their album: Now Here is Nowhere is easily the best CD of this year so far. It's completely swear free and is reminiscent of the Pixies and Flaming Lips as well as other references. Just thought I'd tell you to pick it up. It's amazing. Well, I just got back from driving and I did alright. Now I'm off to go swimming in my neighbors pool. Later.

      Boring. That is the only word that describes this class. Basically you have to sit for three and a half hours and learn how to drive safely. That wouldn't be to bad because after about two classes the time begins to fly. No, the real problem is the language. Swearing is almost non-stop and very very strong. Driving with the instructor, however, is fun and actually exciting. You get to learn hands on how to drive, and the fun of being behind the wheel is pretty cool. My main problem with driving is positioning the car in my lane. This ends with the car grinding into the gravel on the edge of the road. After two hours I was getting better at driving and hopefully I'll do good tommorrow from ten to twelve in the morning.

      To be honest with you I thought blogging had something to do with Playdough. Weird, but true. The name just seemed like that to me and when I found out that this was blogging, I was surprised. Anyway, as this is my first Blog ever, I have no idea what to write. Over and out.

      After not blogging for a while I have returned. My cousins just left to go back to Oregon and finally my life can be normal again. So, I've been driving and playing videogames, but not much else. The girl I like hasn't responded to me in a long while and I'm wondering what she's doing.  I just watched the first Spiderman again and an still impressed by the entire thing(And Kirsten Dunst's good looks). Over and out.
