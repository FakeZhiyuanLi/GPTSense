         Have you ever heard the saying, never eat the food a skinny person cooks? As if its awful food or something. Well...contrary to that belief, I am a pretty darn good cook...BUT during the rodeo I helped out with the concession stand making burgers. They're the same burgers sold at every concession stand I've ever been to, but they look....ummm....NOT SO GOOD! After cooking a few of them, Mindy and I checked the ingredients...did you know they put ground beef hearts into those things? AND they weren't even pink, it looked like pork...with NO pork...or so the label says. Everyone seemed to really enjoy the burgers, but Mindy and I just could not bring ourselves to eat them...Dairy Queen-here we come!! This happened before lunch and around 4pm...Stacie, Joanna, Robbi, Mary, Crystal, and myself were all ready for the 'Calf Dressing' event in which three people are on a team, have a pair of huge shorts (or 'panties'), and there's a steer with a halter and lead rope waiting for us in the chute. The purpose is to put the shorts on the steer and take them to the circle in the middle of the arena. Everyone was pretty nervous and I don't care what anyone says, for a couple of women weighing in at 100 to 140lbs, a 300lb steer was massive in size!! So, open the chutes and let the game begin! Our steer came out in a rage and on his back feet! I remember looking him in the eye and then eating dirt as I saw hooves and legs and people all around. Once standing, we get the steer to the circle in the middle of the arena. Then there's the announcer..."Looks like someone's dropped their panties in the arena!" In between gasps for air, our steer was finally calm, Mary, Crystal, and I all look at one another and then about 50yrds away, there lie our calf's panties...SHIT! Who's gonna go get them?! Off Mary goes and it's round and round in circles from there. We got tangled up with the other girls steer and then thay both got loose and ran to the other end of the arena. Finally..we each catch our steer and try once more with the panties...to no avail. We lost, another team won...and I was pretty mad..I don't know why, I barely have a temper problem!! So I started walking to the gate, picked up someone's panties they'd dropped and about the time I lifted up from getting them a loose steer comes running at me! I shooed him off and he kicked the air...yep, I was as upset as he was about being in the arena. But, once my nerves cooled, a smile was back on my face and all of us were making fun of each other and recalling the whole ordeal. Besides a couple of huge bruises, teeth marks, and cow-shit all over Stacie, a great time was had by all! So, after a shower and a bowl of cereal, we all hit the town for a fun night out....one that was WELL deserved!

           It is said:   If 13 people sit down to dinner together, all will die within the year. The Turks so disliked the number 13 that it was practically expunged from their vocabulary (Brewer, 1894). Many cities do not have a 13th Street or a 13th Avenue. Many buildings don't have a 13th floor. If you have 13 letters in your name, you will have the devil's luck (Jack the Ripper, Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahmer, Lisa Sheffield, Theodore Bundy,  and Albert De Salvo all have 13 letters in their names). There are 13 witches in a coven.    ~~Thought I'd add a little something for Friday the 13th!~~

        For such a small remote town, Alpine has got to house the craziest of all people in the world.  I've met people from all over....Germany, Switzerland, England, and even Argentina.  Yes, I suppose that we should give them some slack because they're from another country and aren't used to the ways of Americans, but some things should go down in history!  One woman has lived here with her husband for 7 years and still cannot speak English, I've seen an Englishman invite..and was serious...a friend of mine to go to Europe and travel for a couple of months...maybe or maybe not to return.  Then there's the German who's into S&M...so I've been told...and the Argentina guys who get so drunk they jump up and down singing the strangest spanish music to each other!!  To go along with the 'out of towners' there are the people  here .  I've seen a registered pedifile walking the streets as a group of young men throw firecrackers at him, a lady who for some reason walks around with foil on her head pushing a grocery basket...(the ol' timers say she's afraid aleins will get her!!)...and then there's the girl who comes into the bar to play the jukebox and dance in front of the mirror by herself.  Oof course there are the hobos that fall off the train everyday like clockwork and the lady (whom everyone claims to be extremly wealthy) that rides around on a donkey and sleeps underneath a tarp on the side of the road.  Yes, I've seen her!  There are farm animals and wildlife that roam the streets night and day.  A place  on the main street houses two roosters in a cage as if she's trying to decorate her lawn, herds of deer run through downtown Alpine during hunting season...I've even seen a huge buck walking around our neighborhood with christmas lights stuck in his antlers.  And then there's the goat story...and I think that the goat wasn't enough for these people, because now there's a rabbit in the backyard for the dog to play with and a rooster whose crow has a crack in it and it sounds liek when Robbi trys to play her violin!!!  I've also not seen a town with so much law enforcement either....Border Patrol, Sheriff, City Police, DEA, Customs, DPS...and Alpine crawls with TABC officers.  All of this to say, there are nice normal citizens out there, but who wants to talk about the normal people?  I mean, not only is our town full of alcoholics and drunk college students, but strange people too!  As I've said before, there's never a dull moment around here!  It's great!     Lisa

        So I'm on my way out of town, which means I have atleast 30 miles of desolate land to drive through, and my new car begins to overheat.  As I am beginning to get used to things either breaking down or falling apart on me....whether it's my car or my friends...or myself!....I just roll my eyes, pull over and immidiatly blame it on myself...surely there was something I could've done to keep this car from overheating....maybe I should've just drove it into the lake...that'd have ooled it off.  But, seeing as there is no lake for over 300 miles, I get on the phone and wait for a ride.  After driving the 30 miles to town, getting the antifreeze and oil my father suggested, we drive 30 miles to my car and realize it's the red antifreeze we need and we'd bought the green.  So...once again..what had I been thinking?!!  Back to town we go...exchange antifreeze, eat a burger, grab the dogs (a joy ride for them)....then drive the 30 miles to my car..AGAIN!  Trying to limp it back to Alpine, it began to RE-overheat, so we called Josh to bring his trailer and haul us in.  Being as it was atleast 110 degrees outside and not knowing how long it'd take Josh, we lifted up the hatchback on the car and counted the many passing cars that were in too big of a hurry to help us..thank God we weren't dying.  Well...the heat WAS getting to us, so I decided to take off my pants and run around in my shirt and underwear doing cartwheels in the road....Robbi and I made up a few of our own Jane Fonda/Richard Simmons moves and... well...not only was the heat beggining to fry our brains, but we were in the middle of no where and no one was stopping to help us anyway!  We actually counted 87 vehicles carrying unthoughtful jerks who wouldn't stop and help!!  Finally, after sitting on the side of HWY 67 for an hour and a half in the blazing sun, Robbi began yelling at me to put my pants on...there's Josh!! We hauled my car in, dropped it off at the mechanics, and then headed to the bar...a nice cold beer was needed for all!!  Needless to say, that was Saturday, and as of today, (thurs)  my car is still at the mechanics waiting to get worked on.  Of course, this is all a result of me living as far away as I can from actual civilization and of me not thinking too clearly....but it makes for a great adventure!!

        This website is to allow my friends and family and others whom I seldom communicate with, to keep up with the goings on in my life. As of a year ago, I moved to Alpine,TX and am currently attending Sul Ross State University and am enrolled in the Veterinary Technician Program. Last year I was Vice President of the Sul Ross Veterinary & Technician Association which involved setting up fundraisers for 'continuing education' trips to the Southwest Veterinary Symposium. Not only did our fundraisers benefit the students, but the community as well by doing weekend 'bath &amp; dips' for dogs &amp; cats to help keep them bug free! We were extremly successful and hopefully will be again this next year. Along with going to school full time I am also working a couple of different jobs as a bartender and waitress. This allows me to meet newcomers in Alpine and to get to know the ol' timers as well. Friends have been hard to come by (for me) in the past, but here...in this remote town....there's always someone willing to help. In the past year I have lived in three different places, and just last week moved into my fourth home. My roomate/co-worker, Robbi, has become a really close friend of mine and I don't know what I'd do without her. Molly also lives with us...she's become our security system/alarm. For those of ya'll who haven't met Molly, she's a 13mth old Great Pyrenees mix weighing in at about 85lbs. She's a little underweight and allergic to everything under the sun, so we've put her on a weight gaining diet which, hopefully, will work. She's also NOT the brightest crayon in the box and has some NOT so intellgent moments, which Robbi and I have dubbed "Molly Moments". Her slow thinking is a result of one of her owner's 'blonde moments'...of which we will not discuss.
