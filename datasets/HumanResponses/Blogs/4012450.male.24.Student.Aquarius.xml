      This is second time I update this site. I'm writing a diary everyday in Japanese. Writing is one of my hobby.So it's not so painful.In the case of Japanese...  Last time I wrote this,I put my dictionary on my right hand. But today,I don't have it. SO,I can't use difficult words.hello? how are you? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;KON NICHI WA? OGENKI DESU KA?  Recently I sometimes watch soccor games. I watched&nbsp;Japan vs Thailand yesterday,and Japan vs Australia today. First one was held in China. That is Asia charmpionshi games. There were something that I couldn't beleive about that game. I (and perhaps many Japanese who watched that game) thought that Chinese must be stupid.  They might hate us Japanese. Because we had a war about 60 years ago. Chinese goverment use it. It wants people to hate Japanese in order to avoid complaining to it. I don't say "I can't understand it".But...  I've heard about Hooligan. They are cheering their national team or something. They may behave violently,when there favorite team lose. But,they won't go to the studium to make some booing.&nbsp;  Why do they do that? Is&nbsp; it fun? I never think so. NO WAY? SHIKATA NAI? Even if you say that,I think "they must be stupid!" CHINA HA BAKA NI CHIGAI NAI!

      I haven't updated here for over 1 week. So I have to write something,but I have no idea! What should I write?  Now I'm free. I don't have a job. But I'm busy. Instead of working,I'm studying English,and taking care of my grandmother. She lievs alone. So almost everyday,I visit her house. She can walk but it is hard for her to walk by holding something.  She used to live with her son,but he passed away few months ago. However it's not so bad... Why?  I might tell about it someday.  And she has also lost her doughter,my mother. I'm 24years old,and have to work. But if you were me,could you leave her alone?  Now,economy in japan is not so good,I can guess easily that to get job is difficult. So I'm studying English,and I'll have a 'TOEIC'test. I have to study for that test. But I have no time to study.  There are many things that I have to do. Houseworking like wash cloths and dish...taking care of grandmother,going to language school,study for test,taking care of my petdog,and so on... I can do some,but I can't do all of them. For example,if I do housework grandma and language school,I can't study for test.  But some of my friends told me that he had to work from 9 A.M to 1 A.M.So I can't complaine,can I...  Hu,,,(sigh)

      I want to speak English,but I don't have friends,to have English conversation. So I made this site,and I expected someone to read this. At the last update,I begged to leave some comments here. But... Should I contenue this site?  By the way,"竹下" Can you read this? This is a common Japanese family name. First letter means 'banboo',and second is 'under'. So we can imagine there ansentors used to live under trees,especialy "banboo" There was a prime minister who has this family name.  Why did I write this? The reason is...We read this "TAKESHITA"OK? Do you understand? LIke this,between languages,there are something that gives me 'shock'.  I want to tell those. And I want to know more... If you...no,no,I have to wait more people who visit. See you!

      Who is watching this site? I want to know. Could you leave a comment if you want,please. It will give me great power to contenu this. And correct these sentences.  I attended a party few weeks ago. Since that,some people who were at that party ask me "Are you OK?" Actualy,I drunk too much,and I was dunkard. YOPPARAI! A man told me I hit him by the umbrella stand and put it on my head... But I don't remember it. I know I sometimes go crazy by drinking. I just wanted to know what I had done.  So,I asked another woman about it. When she told me that pharase I said. "Why do you say that? What did I do?" By the way,is it a polite question? I am not nateve. So I don't know if the pharase could hurt person. Can it do? It maight?  English is difficult for me!Or communication is more difficult!MUZUKASII Is my favorite place my room? No no,I need to have a chat more! Who can do this? you? please!
