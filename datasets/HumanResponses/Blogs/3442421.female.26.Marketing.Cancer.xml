      I bet there are 1000's of blogs out there with "it starts" as there title entry. perhaps that is a sign of what it is come from this blog, yet another waste of realestate in cyberspace. Let it be known, "i love cyber space"  I do not have any particular reason for starting a blog. I was on blogspot looking for Sexinthelibrary [with out and luck] and noticed how easy it was for me to open an account and start the process. So there you have it, my first post.

      ok- I feel this is the first of many blogshattering posts. I may have found a purpose for this thing after all. I believe I am on the verge of doing something incredible.   ANOTE FROM THE WRITER: take incredible lightly, it is a subjective word. my terms of incrediblity are certainly different from yours.  On sunday my sister made me a video tape with her miniDV camera and overnighted it to me. I spent most of the weekend waiting to hear what would be on the tape, then I woke up Monday counting the hours until the tape would arrive. That morning i pulled out my DV camera, pluged it into my TV and an electrical outlet. Everything was ready, when I arrived home from work for my lunch break, the tape would be there. Fedex had garunteed 10:30AM delievery. My 11:30AM lunch time gave the fedex company an extra hour. I arrive, barely able to contain my excitment (I was well past a good sparkle).   no tape.  I track down the tape at a fedex station near by my office, I rush there to pick it up. Granted I still would not be able to watch it until after work. But at least it would be in my pocession.  no tape.  It had gone out to a different fedex branch about 20 minutes away. Well I was already 15 minutes late getting back to work. So I returned to my job a bit defeated. For most of the afternoon I bide my time waiting for the moment I could leave and begin my journey to the North Fedex branch. SURPRIZE.. my husband is getting off  work early and will pick up the package. In the package is the tape.  Now all I have to do is get home with dinner, sit down and watch the tape.  not so.  My DV camera decides last night would be a good night to break.  To the computer for trouble shooting, calling friends to find a camcoder we can borrow. Finally after several (3) hours without any luck I demand we go to Best Buy. Surely the electronic super store will have something that will allow me to watch this tape.  but no.....

      to sparkle is to penetrate others with your energy. i love to sparkle. i wonder why it is hard to sparkle? Last night I was told to sparkle, which was a nice way of spinning (spinning, spinning, spinning) on shumooze and mingle. I was a bit hurt. I didn't want to be told to sparkle on demand. to sparkle is special. It is not being nice or high energy. When you sparkle you are beyond description, you are happy, glowing,,, oops.. I was trying to describe it, even though it is "beyond description."

      I have expanded my space on the internet. I love the super internet highway! But typically only get to spend time using it and creating things for it while at work. But last night I acquired some web space. Thusly securing my own little area of the web. Right now it is going to serve as a method for showing off my vacation photos. But I love to make plans, so perhaps I will make a plan for this space. It would be great if I could use it for commerce, but I do not have anything to sell. So for now it will be a place for me to display my photographs and my family and work on my web skills. I plan to spend the weekend working with FLASH. It would be so cool to make flash movies for my website.   Ah, my website. I feel like I am finally apart of this new millienium.  feel free to look.  urlLink  www.milmoreconsolidated.com  Don't worry patt, you will still be able to find my thoughts (incomplete and without purpose) here

      1. ok, so DC is really a city. I real urban environment. I was amazed, it is the coolest city I have seen in America (realize my reference for this is limited). It is cramped and crowed, there are more pizza/pasta places than burger joints. You can drive for miles without seeing a hint of commericalized Americana. There weren't walmarts, albertsons or taco bells, instead little markets, and 5 ethopian restaurants on the same block. The people that inhabit the little castle buildings are interesting for both the eyes and the ears. Plus you have the added bonus, of it being the capital of our nation. So there is this historical aspect that still blows my mind. Being there made me proud to live in america. Which I haven't been since before I went a vistin' europe some 5 years ago. The  urlLink Smithsonians 'are a treasure. Arces upon Arces of  FREE  museum space. I had never seen anthing like it.   2. the DC weeners were just like the texas weeners; loud, rowdy, they don't dance, they sing every song  3. last night i returned to fort worth, texas. disappointment. I put up with the same "urban" elements as those folks living in DC, yet I do not get any of the urban rewards. I can't go shopping on Sunday morning. When it comes to voting for the best place to buy clothing, a department store in the mall wins! Not a cute boutique full of interesting items. If I need bread, cheese, or beer. Where do I go, to a giant store. Oh wait - to one of 6 giant stores within two miles of my house. People and industry eat up land, and I have yet to realize any benefit. They ate up land to build a beautiful museum, they filled it with percious works of art, ALL WONDERFUL. Then they cut back the hours and start charging people to go there. I haven't been back. The planning in my city sucks. I need to return to work. But trust me I have more to say on this subject.

      1. i thought DC was basically an office park with pretty buildings and parking garages 2. that concert goers on the other side of the country would be different from those in the DFW metroplex 3. that living in texas could seem worse

       Off we (husband dave) Go   the nails have been painted. the maintanence finished. the ride arranged. the cats fed and livelihood secured. rental car reserved through  urlLink priceline  Our race begins.   4:20 flight leaves DFW 7:30 doors open for the  urlLink Ween  show at  urlLink club 9:30  8:18 flight arrives at BWI (34 miles from club 9:30 in Washington DC) Now the race gets tricky... to the rental car counter, now to navigate the roads of two of our nations largest cities. Ween goes on at 9:00.  I bet we make it.  after the show, we will take a night drive through the mall area and take some pictures of the Reagan line (it will be the final hours of him lying in state)than to bed. The next day we will take on Capital City. Then to the country for RELAXING poolside.   I will find a way to post pictures next week

      Did you know the national zoo was  free , and that there are panda bears there. This week I am headed to the District of Columbia. Under normal circumstances, I would be thrilled and be spending most of my work day planning my way around the sites. But instead I am planning where I need to be in order to get the best photographs of a former president's body riding through the city. Often in my life, I feel blessed, lucky, touched by some mysterious source that creates wonderful moments for me. This week that feeling is strong. I have been to the Maryland 3 times. My mother-in-law lives outside of Baltimore on a ranch. So when I get to the east coast, I disappear into the country until it is time to board a plan back to Texas (which is where I live, but is not home). When my husband and I started planning our trip to see his mother for her 50th birthday, I demanded that I get to spend a day in Washington DC. This was not a guarantee until I discovered that  urlLink Ween  was playing a show at the 9:30 Club in Washington on Thursday night. This was enough to seal the deal for my husband, tickets were purchased and plans were arranged.  A week passes and a president dies. It so happens that the one day I plan on being in Washington (I am spending the night and had planned on waking up to see the sites) is the day a nation plans to say good-bye to our cold war president. So instead of being a quite tourist walking around taking pictures and trying to remember history, I will be there while it is being made. I feel lucky.  But I might just wonder over to our national zoo and spend the day with the pandas.

      Perhaps my life is not complicated. I think I get bogged down by life's maintenance. Maintenance, I really hate maintenance.  urlLink Tom Robbins  created a character named Switters in  urlLink Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates . He is a dream of a man, I am sure none like him exist in a nonfictional realm. He hated maintenance, and gave me even more disdain for the processes we have to deal with as humans. I am a planner. I love to have plans. I like times and events all figured out before I begin, because it hampers my experience when a situation requires maintenance. If you must stop and determine the process. When you have to leave the party or conversation to use the bathroom. maintenance in my day includes, but is not limited too; brushing my teeth, at least twice a day (honestly, never more, sometimes less) a shower (if the world is lucky)(and it is in the shower that I must perform many maintenance related tasks) I must eat and drink, I must watch the gas gauge, I must feed the animals, dress myself, take birth control, on and on and on and on. These things dramatically cut into my enjoyment time. If I could just snap my fingers and be ready for work I would gain about an hour everyday. If I could snap and suddenly be at a restaurant with my friends, I would save at least twenty minutes and 3 phones call every Friday. My life is going faster and feeling more complication because I keep adding new things into my daily maintenance routine.

       I FUCKING HATE COMPLICATED THINGS  It seems that I am in charge of my life. That seems fair enough and not unreasonable. But as I have gotten older, I have come to realize I am kind of in charge of many lives around me. Granted I do not have any children and am not considering my animals (they have more control over me then I do of them).  ooppsss.digression.  Complications are a part of my life! I want to go somewhere, but i must figure out how it fits in schedules, who will drive, who will pay, where I will go. Next week I want to go to a ween show, nothing but complications. I want to change careers, nothing but complications. I want to articulate a point about why my life moves quickly in the complicated world and again nothing but complications. FUCK THIS@

       things i aspire to do before i quite blogging  1. become regular 2. delevelop a reason for why i am a blogger 3. actually get the ideas i have when not at a computer, into this 'posting' section so that there is something interesting in my blog 4. use this as a tool for writing my book   Lately I have started to print emails, emails from years ago. the death of paper mail has left a void in my memories box. I intend to fill that void with printed emails. I also think they with make for easy quoting in my book.

       I am typing this from my home PC. Which means I get all of the formatting offered by blogspot.          I can number my ideas         or better yet, use a bullet    now on to my message. Yesterday I found out that patt is not the only blog reader I have. I know, I find it amazing as well. Unfortunately this means I am going to have to be more thoughtful of readers. SO I hereby proclaim, that I will try my hardest to have well structured emails. With thoughts and stories that actually make sense to people who cannot readily access milmore information.     This week we plan to put a bid in on an old house in  urlLink Hills, MN . This bid isn't nearly as much fun as an ebay bid. There is not a counter, or bid history, I cannot hit refresh to check the status. Basically the entire process has to be done offline. I really do not like to do things offline.     There -  I just conveyed a thought without to much digression.    Here is a cool website a fellow blogger had detailed:    urlLink The Mirror Project

      I wish someone would explain why blogging is so popular. Is it just that we are all little girls wishing for a diary? I hope not, because whenever I find a diary from my youth, I think what was written sounds ridiculous and blogs will not be found five years from now. They will be deleted from the world of blogspot, perhapps even blogspot will be gone. If they are read by friends and family alone, then what is the point. maybe it has something to do with the thoughts you are willing to type, but not say. or the fact that your ideas and thoughts are out there, without fear of people judging you. i just dont know. because I do enjoy typing in this little box, but I don't get anything out of it, and I don't think anyone else does either. So is it a big time waster? I suppose I am going to continue to post until Time pickups on milmoreconsolidated. At that time I will be forced to quit. you must always live your public wanting more.

      yes, i have a way to show off my pretty pictures. Not of me. The pictures I take. Check them out at www.milmoreconsoldiated.com i would have made that a link, but the blogspot people are not very considerate of mac users. Not only do I  not get the option to spell check my posts, I also cannot make them links or bold or colored unless I edit the html, which is what I do for a living and not what I want to do when I am taking a break at work.

      situations that frustrate me seem to happen all the time. Usually I get frustrated when I need one thing to get another, but i can't have that thing without having the other. confused. I will give you two examples. Example One At work I use very old software (I work in a marketing department with very design software). I wanted to update the software to make many projects much easier and certainly give me more tools to use in my work. Well I can't have the new software until I update the hardware on my computer. I can get the powers that be to buy the software, but not the hardware. The software is no good unless I have the hardware. If they buy the hardware I cannot have the software. But I can't use the new hardware with my old software. Basically I am stuck with the slow computer and the crappy software.  Example Two I want to buy a beautiful home in Hills, MN. I need a loan to the buy the home. To get a loan I need proof of employment. If I move to HIlls, MN, I have to give up my job in Fort Worth, Texas therefore giving up my proof of employment. I can't get a job in that area, because I don't live there. I can't live there unless I have a place to stay, I don't have a place to stay unless I have proof of employment. The loan people tell me that my credit history is excellent and that savings my husband and I have is great, good enough to qualify for the lowest rates available. He continues to tell me that if I will not be comutting (the 15 hours) back to my job then I cannot qualify for this great loan. Instead I would have to get a "specialized loan", also called (while I spoke with him) "non-conformist loan" "non-prime loan" and my favorite "drug deal loan."  So suddenly years of excellent bill paying and attempting to get  purrfect credit-GONE. It doesn't mean shit unless I can prove I have worked in the area for a month. This other loan, will be at a higher rate, require a BIG down payment, and basicaly continue to screw me over for 30 years. this situation is frustrating. I just wanted to move to a peaceful town, buy a goat, work with my mother, raise some children, and find a nice little job.    Obviously, I care much more about example two than example one. I am sure blogreader patt is wondering how I will ever be lucky enough to get a job with such terrible spelling and writing skills. that is a question I am unable to answer since I have not heard back from any of the jobs I have applyed for. with any luck i will have a wonderful evening with some dear friends and not have to deal with these frustrations until sunday when it is time to plan the next few years of my life.

      so many stories, so little interest in turning them into text, especially without the aid of a spell checker. But if this site is to be a tool for my book, it needs content. So here she goes....  ROCK AND ROLL VACATION  For starters I knew that this was to be the final out-of-town adventure with some very dear freinds, so i wanted to make it count. Not only for myself, but for them as well.   I was unsure if I should highlight events, moments, or just concentrate on the ideas that came out of the weekend. I guess so far I am not doing any of that.  FAVORITE MOMENT: they all were so great. I can pick out a great moment for everything, but I really loved this whole weekend. Even when we were dragging our asses accross the 98 degree payment of Dallas' Deep Elm (which smells like garage) trying to decide where we should eat that would also help us kill a few hours before we went to wait in line.  FAVORITE EVENT: Our Wonkavador in the fancey hotel (again, brought to me for a reasonable price by the great travel website, priceline.com). Our hotel had glass/plastic elevators so that paterons can enjoy the view as they assend to their rooms. I love this feature! If any hotel designers stumble onto this blog please note, ALWAYS HAVE GLASS ELEVATORS IN YOUR HOTELS! We rode from the top to the bottom many times and it was amazing everytime.   IDEA LEARNED: Singer/Songwriter Corn Mo taught me that I should embrace my future no matter where it takes me. Bascially he confirmed that Texas sucks and you should flee as quickly as possible. Apparently, he taught me this at both the Saturday and Sunday night show but I didn't really pick up on it until Sunday. Saturday I was under many influences so any symbolism or philosphy was quickly absorbed by damaged brain cells. Now I don't think Corn Mo is a great man to get ideas from, that is wrong. He has good ideas, but man his music is NOT my cup of tea.  My weekend was great! another note for hotel designers everywhere... Whenever you can, take a weekend off. Even if it is just across town. It is worth it. Be a tourist sometimes and enjoy your surroundings rather then letting the everyday maintance of life get you down.

      My favoirte phrase Funky ass shit.  it is great and so verstile.  I am not keeping this blog very updated.  since my last post I have traveled to nebraska to visit the greatest zoo in the USA, my husband has seen the house in the town of 540, I have made special chocolates, i have  a new favorite song. Next weekend I will be out of town again. It will be the fifth weekend in a row. I think i am getting worn out.  lexi

      I saw the tape. After spending days awaiting its arrival, hours planning its viewing, several additional hours trying to find a way to watch, was it worth the effort. I am unsure. I know we would have had an easier week, had we not seen it. Now we are informed, no guessing. Decisions will need to made. They are hard decisions to make. It would have been easier to not be informed and just let the issue pass without much thought. WOW, that applies to so many people and things in life. I guess it is easier to be uninformed and not worry.  I know this guy who has become very informed within the last year or so and honestly, he is now a party pooper. He spends most of this social time worked up over the world, because he is so informed and chooses to focus heavily on the negative elements of the world. I try to stay informed, but for every evil I hear about I search out a great humanist story, or a great photo of an animal, or an email about a friends own victory against evil. I think it helps. I can be cyincal, but I also spend a good amount of time in a happy little bliss.   digression. AUGHGHGHGHGHHSHA.  what was this suppose to be about?  As I sit  at my desk, dreaming of my holiday weekend, I am also scared of making a wrong decision. For many years I lived my life in the pursuit of goals, lately I have not. I think I am going to change that, I can get through scary times. I have before. Hell, it is much easier to be scared about your own situations than be scared for those you love and their decisions.  long and short, i may be moving from one of the 20 largest cities in america and certainly a giant metroplex to a town of 540.   How crazy does that sound? I want to be happy. I have lived in texas nearly as long as I have lived anywhere else.

      I know the Alexander ranch well, I have had wonderful times there. It is located on the Oahe Reservoir (Missouri River), is still undeveloped and it is beautiful! Animals still roam free, sunsets are not filtered through pollutants and it changes with the seasons. In the winter the white snow filled hills are blinding, nothing but animal prints disrupt the snowy mounds. It shimmers under the bright sun, blizzards are a common occurrence. Spring brings life, baby geese, deer, cows, horses, chickens, prairie dogs, rattlesnakes, and antelope. A rebirth from the ground – up. By summer the rain has stopped and the dust begins to blow. Cacti are common and by August fields of sunflowers watch the suns cycle. When fall arrives everything begins to prepare for winter. Movement is everywhere, crops are being brought it, animals are storing food, shelters are being reinforced, winters are always hard and preparation increases the chances of survival. My great-great-grandfathers land was acquired through the government. He was stationed at Fort Sumpter in Pierre and received land on the Missouri river as a reward or possibly incentive for serving his country. The cattle that would roam the land were also gotten out of an arrangement with the government, this time for marrying a member of the Sioux Indian Tribe. How many cows, I will never know. This was the start of the Ounken and Alexanders intermixing with the Indians. Every member of both families lived a horse ride away from one another and all of their entertainment came from the land. My Mother grew up with pet goats, cats, chickens, raccoons, and I have even seen a picture of her playing with a pet beaver. Yes, a beaver. In the picture it sits in a highchair with a doll and my mother (roughly age 8) is feeding it. Her grandparents lived on the other side of the bull cage. Jay & Glades – Jay was a rancher complete with handlebar mustache, card shuffler and cigar. Granny Gladys took care of the cooking, sewing, cleaning, and well being. She is said to have been my mother’s best friend. My interactions with her usually involved eating and gathering eggs, except one day. Long after my mother had left the ranch to have her own family, and Grandpa Jay had died, my father drove me 3.5 hours for an Odyssey of the Mind state tournament. We arrived 1 day early to give my dad plenty of fishing time. At 9:00am my father pulled onto the dirt road that led to the main house, but stopped first at Rocky’s, (my mother’s younger brother by some 20 years) trailer. They were going to go fishing for the day while I hung out with Granny. I hiked to the house, knock knock, when she answered the door she was convinced that I was her grand-daughter Jacque. She became very upset and was talking very fast. She told me I had gone to Europe and to college and married that John-boy. She would not let me enter the house, and said I shouldn’t be there because I had left the Alexander family when I married John. Than at the age of 12 I had the opportunity to spend a spring morning and afternoon alone on a  ????acre ranch.

      The nuclear family that I am a part of consists of 2 families - joined together back in 19??. (the first of many facts, I do not know) One family hailed from a small town in the higher populated part of South Dakota, the other came from “west river,” they were cowboys, ranchers, and Indians. The wedding took place in Pierre, SD (that is peer, not pee-air; they are cowboys NOT French exiles). These families have nothing in common, no common interest, heritage or lifestyle. I wasn’t at the wedding but it is safe to say many where wondering why they were there. The pregnant bride nearly took her Grandfather’s offer to help her run out, but stayed to walk down the aisle to meet a drunken, sticking, Lambda Chi man that would be my father. Their wedding was held in the same church that would later see the memorial service of my great grandparents Alexander, my Grandma Alexander, and a woman known as Aunt Whinnie (died at 105 and for several years was the oldest living member of the Sioux Nation). I wish I could have been there to see one of the first attempts at mixing those families, the foreshadowing would have been everywhere.

      The next posts are intended to be an autobiography of my first twenty-five years as an embryo and girl on Earth. I have to be the first to admit that the thoughts written about are mine, they are based on the way I remember things happening or how my mind preferred to remember them. I often make the claim that much of my childhood is repressed, but this has never been diagnosed. It could be that my memories are  fuzzy  or I have a bad memory. I know that in later years it has all been short term memory loss. Anyway I should not be held responsible for my memories for I admit they maybe remembered inaccurately. I am using my perceptions of events that have happened. Families often lie to protect one another, children are often spared details, images and smells trap a memory much better than facts and figures. SO although I am trying to draw conclusions about my life there is no way of knowing if my perceptions about life are accurate.
