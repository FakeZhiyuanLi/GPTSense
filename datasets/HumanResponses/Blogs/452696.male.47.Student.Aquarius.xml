       I am back to work today and busy cleaning up crap from the weeks before. This usually takes a great deal of time out of the day until I get to a point where I can begin work on my actual projects. Currently 2 e-learning projects are on the board, as well as other miscellaneous G8 related duties and reports. I need to FOCUS!!!!!! AHHHH!!!!

       My website provides me with a sharing space for friends and family. As well it allows me to try out various web technologies that I may not currently be able to do at work. You can check it out at  urlLink Scrimshaws Webspace  my main site links to other things. It's my manual Blog I guess.

       I tried Radio Userland for their trial period. I just couldn't justify spending 40.00 U.S. to use space that I wouldn't fill on their server. I mean let's face it, I can link to the space provided by my ISP if I want to display graphics or video. And since I'm already spending over 40.00 a month for th epriveledge of using the Internet, I may as well do my blogging for zip. I like Blogger better anyways. I didn't see any real advantage to using theirs over Blogger. Maybe I'm blind to it, but even Blogger Pro (for me) serves no real advantage. Maybe I need to become more verbose.

       April 2003. I think this is when I leave one career and look to starting another. Back to school at 46 years old. Yikes. I'm experiencing lots of trepidation regarding leaving something familiar and walking a different walk, but I have to do it. My head is just not in the game where I'm working now. And if I remained there I'd likely be moving to a position where that could have a negative effect on everyone around me. So, time to let my life unfold before me as the gods (god) intended.  My father's family is gone. Two brothers, two sisters, mother, father, uncles, and of course my dad. All dead now. Just in the last two weeks his two sisters died. One right after the other. Gives one a wierd feeling knowing that there is an end to this life. I hope there is something else afterwards. But as the Scottish proverb goes, "Better enjoy this life while you can, for you're a long time dead."

       So I yielded to peer pressure from my friend Jacques and went and played 9 holes of golf last week. first time in 20 years I'd done this. And as I hacked my way around the course I remembered why I stopped playing. I suck at golf...and it isn't a game that I want to spend a lot of time at to get good...so why play it? It's a lots like darts, only with clubs. But you do get the satisfaction of hitting something and the walk was nice.

       God I feel lethargic lately. Even if I work out...run, lift weights and stuff. I still feel tired..just a little more so. Slowly but surely I'm finishing off the e-learning projects at work. My goal is to get them done before I retire next year. Getting them done entails more than just getting them working. I also means getting our IT on side with the global project concept and developing a process and key contact people who will make things happen without red tape and barriers. I'm hopeful it can be done. As long as we do it in an intelligent and meaningful manner, involving all of our stakeholders along the way. We'll see.  I signed up for the online version of the book of the month club at  urlLink Audible.com . So far it has proven to be really good. Thoug a little on the expensive side at $20 U.S. per month (30 Cdn) for two books. So a year is $360 Cdn. Yikes..now that I see it in print it's a lot!!! Ah well maybe I can learn something along the way in their  urlLink self help  sections. And be entertained in their  urlLink Fiction  section. For sepnding all that cash I even got a nifty little  urlLink book/MP3  player from them. Their format is propriety though and to load to any device, you have to have it enabled to prevent multiple copying of files to non-paying napster types.

       I'm well into the first class of many to come at Alberta college of Art. Lots of work and major pain in the right brain. But it's a good pain. Hopefully it means I'm stretching myself and allowing some abstract thinking and creativity in. Work is wierder than ever lately. Go figure. I'm looking forward to leaving. Strange to feel this way about something I dedicated the last 25 years of my life to. Maybe I believed too much. Gave too much of myself over to a faith in other people doing what they are supposed to do, to move ahead and not just to preserve the now. I know it's right to leave, because I cannot talk about some areas of my present workplace without feeling anger and rage. Better I go somewhere else and channel that into something creative, rather than destroy myself by being where I am. O.K. I'm starting to depress myself now, so I'd better go work out and channel the feeling.

       Well, I completed my last budget presentation for the Calgary Police Service yesterday, after several days of edits and reviews to it and the speech that went along with it. Seemed to be well revieved by City Council members, and was almost a unanimous sweep in passing it as recommednded by our Police Commission. Good for the CPS and great for the employees who will now, (hopefully) get somewhat of a boost in support for projects and initiatives that were put into abeyance for G8, WPC and Y2K. Good for me, because my position, which was never really a sanctioned full time position (until now) will be able to be filled by a civilian with the proper multimedia skillsets necessary to hit the ground running when I leave the CPS in April. Plus there will be some development capital in the kitty for e-learning development for the service. Most excellent.

       It's the beginning of 2003 and the pressure is on. Several projects are due to be wrapped up, or some semblance of wrapping it for the CPS before I wrap it up with the CPS. I want to get my butt into the fall sessions at A.C.A.D., so I have to get a portfolio of recent work together, along with umm....an essay of what is up with...me. I'm 45 years old, and most of the time I really don't know what is up with me. I seem to move from one thing to another in an effort to, what.. get it right? I may never get it right. Whatever it is. Into drawing classes now. Just starting actually. More challenges. I've got to read more. Books that is..

       I'm drawing up a storm in my Saturday class. Man oh man I didn't think that observational drawing was this much work, but oops..wrong again. Takes a great deal of work to capture an image, a feeling, a shape or a moment. Good instructor and lots of interesting people in the class. Lots of interesting works developing both good and not so good in the students. My goal is nothing more than to improve my drawing skill and the way I look at things I draw, so as to describe them better using dfferent mediums, like graphite, charcoal, conte', pen and ink etc. Messy business, but I love it :-)  I'm turning 46 this Tuesady (February 11) and still on the retirement trail. I'm going to be making significantly less, but I think physically and mentally I can't continue working in my current environment. I'm starting to feel the lack of direction, decision and support more and more. I'm also feeling cut out of the overall decision making process for the direction of e-learning. I don't think I'm imagining it, 'cause other people have also noted we suffer a surreal chasing our own tails kinda business model.

       So..the paper is in, the plans have been explained, and...still no clear decisions. There is still hope for the CPS to move forward. But will they? Stay tuned. we'll know next week. Maybe. Ten work days left and counting. Yikes.

       12 more days at work before I retire. I seem to have a choice now of whether I can work really hard and help out this organization I've given 25 years of my life to, or, not. As a result of the last several weeks of my managers avoidance of current projects which would pilot elearning applications within the CPS, I could just do..nothing or go stir the nest with a stick. I'm perplexed. Guess I need to go and make some inquiries with the poobah and see if there is a clearer vision from high atop the mountaintop as to what I should do.  I hope we don't alienate some more Alberta based companies through lack of decision and vision. I'm...feeling like I'm in some bad sitcom. People don't really act like this in reality do they? We'll see . . .

       This is one of my favourite "in the know" type tech pages for those of us who like to ride the bleeding edge. Whether we can afford it or not. Lot's of ratings done on products by them and consumers, so it's an interesting page to point to.  urlLink CNET.com

       O.K. I'm accepted into A.C.A.D. and I've finished a grueling 2 month Spring Session taking 3 courses. I won't ever do that again. One or two maybe, but 3 was pretty much unmanageable. For me anyways. I think I did pretty well though. Need to get some cash together now though. Going to be a tight year. Waaahhh. Better than working for the master debaters.

       I seem to be stuck in some sort of late night loop, where I stay up late and sleep in late (10:0-11:00 A.M.) Yikes. Have to stop this nonsense. It's way too remeniscent of shift work, which got me into a wierd sleep pattern to begin with. Holy Circadian Rhythm disruption Batman.  I registered for my courses for this coming year. Somewhat disappointing since I have completed one semester already, but cannot move ahead until the year does. The courses seem to be set up to cater to someone coming in starting at zero. For example, I had wanted to take the second art history class necessary for foundation year. I can't because it's not scheduled until the Winter session. Doesn't seem to be any advantage to work ahead.  Last couple of weeks has been extremely hot here. All in the 30's. Whew...sweaty. During this time I met with a fellow I had known in my years with the Calgary Police Service and he had an exit interview of sorts with me. He's currently back on contract with them in the H.R. area doing this. We compared notes on similar experiences and found many. He also told me that these same experiences are consistent with all of the other interviews he had conducted with retiring members, and those who had quit. Common themes? I guess this would be an opportunity to fix those issues if the CPS chose to. But it's unlikely they will. Why? They have to keep the feudal system alive and preserve the status quo. If they start making positive changes, then there will be lots of traditional police positions that would need to be filled by properly qualified civilians. Can't have that, where would they put officers that have screwed up or are going through negative psychological problems. I mean, thats what we have human resources and training for isn't it? Or the front counter of district offices.   I figure that in ten years from now if I can speak of the CPS without getting angry then I will have finally moved on. I hope I can make that happen.

       I am floating in nul space. Dizzy, my head feels heavy and I'm tired. All the time. Exercise is what I need, but i did that. It made me more tired. I could go out and get a job and work part time. At what though? I don't just want to work to fill a disposable income void. Maybe I should though 'cause the matrix has me and I'm making payments on my Visa again. Ahhhh screw it.  A woman I worked with phoned me two days ago to tell me that the projects that had been artificially delayed by the pusillanimous poobah that gave me grief near the end of my tenure had finally pushed ahead. Great! I really didn't know how to respond. I'm really happy this organization will finally embrace technology that has been readily available to the average 16 year old for some time now? I feel pretty much like a failure. What could I have done about it? Nothing really. The ability to move technology ahead in that organization is always left up to the master debaters.  I'm the people that needed to get going on projects that had been debated extensively for 5 years. Learning. Training. Effective communication.

       Wow, I am in my second semester at ACAD and only have to complete 3 courses to finish off my first year. I'm struggling a bit (motivation wise) this semester. Probably slipping into a bit of a funk, but hey, I learned that during the renaissance, artists were considered to be of a melancholic temprament. I don't really want to be though. It's a depressing negative space to be in. I completed a website for a friend of mine who is doing humanitarian work in Guatemala. Check it out, it's called  urlLink Ayudamos .

       Yay..finished my essay. But my head hurts. Had to read a thick biography on Manet and 19th Century France. Interesting guy for his time, but man did he ever get hosed by the critics. The world is full of naysayers who exist to preserve the status quo, and their own fishy positions.

       My final exam for Art History on Tuesday June 22nd proved to be both rewarding and disappointing. I got my essay back (98% Yay!!!) but found I didn't study the appropriate material to likely get more than a passing grade on the test. Ah well, you win some... I probably would have got 99% on my essay if I hadn't spelled the intructors name wrong (duh!). She was a good teacher though. Interesting to listen to and liked to impart information by way of storytelling. On to the next semester.
