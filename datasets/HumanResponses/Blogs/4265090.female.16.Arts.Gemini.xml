       i was pondering today...man, i am incredibly blessed. truly. it's insane...      if i could choose the talents God blessed me with, it would definately be what i've got. some of them are what i consider to be rather rare talents...and i wouldn't trade them for anything.       it seems like all the dreams i have ever had, the ones that are really important to me, are coming true. and i think that's what happens when you truly stop living for yourself and decide to give it up to Him. He blesses you, mightily.       it makes me so sad to see people who think that they're good at nothing. like they're nothing special. but they are. they just haven't found that thing yet...their "niche." you've just got to pray about it...and it'll come.      recently, i made the decision to give something up that'd been controlling me for a very long time. for once and for all. and God is blessing me. i never thought that i had any singing ability until recently...and got blessed with a guitar...it's like God is showing me His plan for me.       and i've always been very blessed artistically...really, anything i decide i want to do, i can do it. paint, draw, sculpt, photography, anything. and the creativity...oh man. i look at a blank sheet of paper or canvas, and i've got something beautiful to fill it with. be it words, paint, pencil...you name it, i've got something.   i see a plain t-shirt...give me 20 minutes, scissors, and a needle and thread, and i'll give you something amazing. anything.       but God did not give me these gifts for my own amusement. He's going to use me. and i can't wait.       please forgive me if this post sounds conceited or arrogant...i'm just thankful for what i have.      it's all for Him.

       let me tell you...this girl has some   big   dreams.         ever since i was a little girl, i've been led to do one thing. i just realized it about six months ago, when i decided to really  listen ...that what i was feeling was a calling from God.       i'd see it on television, and get goosebumps...a shiver down my spine...a lump in my throat i couldn't explain. a calling. i'd see live performances and feel a longing so strong...i almost could not contain it.       i've always had a hunger for the spotlight. i was just born with it. i always wanted the lead in the play, the solo in the christmas program...anything i could get.       so, years went on, and these feelings, these passions, became stronger. more real. as i got older, i began to understand that God had a plan and a purpose for me. so, naturally, i wanted to know what that purpose is.      then i realized...these feelings, and passions...they're here for a  reason.  God put them there.         music.           i live it. i breathe it. i sleep it.            so, i had found my passion. my dream, my calling. my next thought:  where do i go from here?          i didn't play an instrument, at that point, i didn't think i had any singing ability. so, more or ess, i thought, "God, what are you expecting me to do here??" so, i prayed. i sang for a friend, he tells me i'm talented. so, i've got that. i pray some more. God blesses me with a beautiful Epiphone guitar.       so, here i am. praying without ceasing, obeying my God, listening for His direction. and He will guide me.       and i leave you with one of my favorite songs...I Was Meant for the Stage, The Decemberists.

       alright...so i am liking this whole blogger thing.      xanga has become a bit too public for me...too impersonal.       so, fair warning, anyone reading this will probably come to know me intimately. i tend to be very honest in posts. brutally, but beautifully. some posts, (well, okay-most posts) are sort of...encrypted. in poetry, song lyrics, generalizations, etc.       but if you are able to decipher these "encryptions," you may just uncover every hidden thought... every whispered word...         ...of who i am.
