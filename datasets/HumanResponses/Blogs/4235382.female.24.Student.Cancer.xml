      I'm still trying to jump through a particularly irritating financial aid hoop, but I am leaving July 4th. My ticket to come back is written down as August 3rd, but the real return date remains unclear. Everything, as usual, will be up in the air until the absolute breaking point. I swim in a maddening ocean of forms and technicalities and stress related deadline breakdowns.  I'll know more once I'm already over there. Yes. Duct tape my dreams together and squirm through the cracks to find my place among the unwanted. Indeed. Organization and planning are for the weak. Drink deep the weird juice of an uncertain future. Why not? The untrodden path is for the billy-goats of humanity. If I’m forced to gnaw my way through the cement wall of stability just to get my chance to write grammatically depraved, self-indulgent tripe, then so be it. Fate doesn’t pull punches. It’s all or nothing. Dance the dance of the doomed and sing the song of the strange. There’s nothing on cable anyway.  To mindlessly plot through a series of bizarre and seemingly unconnected events that transpire to dump me into a financial hole is my calling in life. Should I deny this calling? Apply at Burger King. I could be manager in just under a decade if I play my cards right. But what if I want to eat my cards and slap the other players? The game is fixed and the house always wins. They want to me play their game and lose by their rules. Fifty hours a week and two week-long vacations a year? Is this the American Dream? Never know why, just plod along like a heartless robot. How much vacation did the Nazi's get? Never mind, I don’t want to know. Some answers are just too hard to swallow.  Fuck um. Dump a whole gallon of 92-octane gasoline into the anthill and send the whole pointless fucking shitpile up in delicious, purifying flames. They had their chance for the conversation of change, now it's time for the slap of shame. It's simple. Make P/R meaningless, get the info to the masses, mock the suits and their paid counter-lies. OUR LIES SHALL OVERCOME. The peasants are at the walls, climb the castle and pull down their pants to denounce their small penises. Each and everyone. It's time for the Neo-Nuremberg trials.

      Affection of words is anemone silence in tidal chaos  The metaphor I like most is Happily ever after As if all of language was the tenderness of birds  Even raptor sex dissolves in death spirals  One church built upon another Replacing church with church.  The words I worship most dissolve into love.  *  That I love you means recognized impermanence That I let you, fellow raptor, tear at me with want and loathing.  I planted sunflowers by the gate but left before the flower. Did I not cleave earth for seeds to flourish?  When is it enough? That my head will crumble next to yours under the heft of stones? …to become the dust of pigeon wings  I cannot promise what words will do to me.  Love and love Church and church  The death parting.     (I'm looking for a title and comments)

      It is a good thing that this Blog format is open to more than poetry, because, alas, now that I am home, I have little opportunity to write. It is equally lovely that those of you who apparently have inspiration and time to write oozing from your pores (you know who you are) are sharing your poetry with the masses. Jesse thinks I am dead because I have not yet posted, so, here is proof of my life blood. I am not a dead poet. However, I am feeling much like one since my arrival in warm sunny California, where I rushed directly to the Golden Gate University bookstore in San Francisco and purchsed $300 worth of text books. Mind you, they were out of at least two of the books that I need. Since these lovely (and not so inexpensive) purchases, I have succombed to long days of reading the law. Really, it is so far from reading Barbara Guest or Alice Notley that I feel as if I am studying Chinese or Algebra. My correspondence has taken a back burner, my writing is non-existent, and yet, as Jesse not only fears for my poetic life, but gives me grief as a good Jewish mother should, I am writing this post, to tell you all that while I may not be present often, I am here, I am paying attention, and I am not (yet) a dead poet. Does this thing really lack spell check? G-d help me.

      Morning becomes Apoplectic  I don't like talking in the morning, and anything that demands thinking is ignored until I’ve had coffee.  I don’t know why my mind needs a slow start; it’s as if the chaos to come is kept at bay until I am ready, or at least that’s the illusion.   This morning, while making  coffee, I heard the sounds of distress. I figured my older hens were picking on the younger, which is natural. But natural doesn’t mean acceptable and chickens can be both brutal and stupid.  After the dogs wouldn’t stop barking, I went out. Sure enough, one teenage-chick was stuck in the back of the fenced enclosure, and the other chickens were trying to peck it to death.  Yelling STOP-IT at a chicken doesn’t work like with a dog.  Helping it meant finding a way inside. When I made the enclosure, I made no entry, except for the chickens, nor did I consider that I would ever need to get into their yard.   Arms first, I tried to crawl through their small, oak-framed, pagoda-style door.   I wiggled in past the shoulders, when it hit me that if my boobs wouldn't fit, neither would my hips, and I got stuck. I thought about getting pecked to death by the chickens. I thought about the fact that I was stuck on the ground in dirt and chicken poo, and I still hadn’t had coffee. I was glad I never installed that live-chicken web-cam I once thought would be great. Imagine that picture on the internet! After a few backward flops on the ground, I got out.  The search for wire cutters began.  I sorted through tool drawers, found the cutters, cut through the wire cage and forced my way in through the outside.  Even after that, I couldn’t get the darn bird out.  It was caught by the tongue and foot by some kite string. Maybe its foot was stuck and in trying to peck its way out, it literally got tongue-tied. Don’t know. I fetched the wire cutters and cut the string away, cradled the bird, then forced my way back through the chicken wire fence.   Getting out was a sadistic birth experience.  My arms and legs got cut up from the sharp wire, but the chick mouth was worse. The beak was bloody, clotted, string was coming out from under the tongue, over the tongue, but I couldn’t see why.  I called my vet and they won’t do birds, they did know someone who would, but then why take a dollar-fifty chick to a two hundred dollar vet?   Instead of calling the bird specialist, I got scissors, a flashlight, water and a paperclip.  I became McGuyver. Rinsing the mouth and seeing if it was strong enough to swallow were good indicators of what might come next. It was thirsty, which meant it still had a will to live. I wrapped it in a towel, held it upside down on my lap, then my youngest came in, I figured….a recruit!   She was made sick by the blood. I told her to put her feelings aside and hold the darn flashlight.  She was reluctant, but did it. “Oh mom, that’s Foxy.”  This chick had a name.   Caitlin had to focus on getting the light into the mouth and not getting in the way.  I figured she’d be the better for it, or else I’d soon have a dead chicken and barf to clean. “Mom, you’re bleeding.” “Yeah, I know,”  I said to acknowledge her alarm.   I used the straightened paperclip end to clean the debris, blood and to unknot, but couldn’t get it all out.  The scissors were too big to work in the chicken beak. It was like shooting a bazooka at a mosquito.   I ended up putting the search on for a smaller scissor, then cutting as much away as possible while avoiding the little chicken tongue. I don’t know how long it took, only that it seemed like forever.  After the oral surgery Caitlin cuddled the bird in a towel.  The chicken didn’t give up, and neither did we. Caitlin learned a bit about obligation, even when it’s messy, even if you have to bleed a bit.  Soon I’ll be reheating that coffee, but not before repairing the cut fence. In the immortal words of Sam th Hobbit, “There’s still a little good in this world, and it’s worth fightin’ for.”  Ok, I’m over forty and a bit too soft to squeeze through small doors, and I am not too sure about what the good is in a little chicken, but our pet Foxy will live and my daughter knows a little more about responsibility.

      The Greensboro Review, edited by Jim Clark is a nice collection of poems and stories. I found many of the poems to be vignette oriented, with one being in letter format, one pantoum and one prose-poem. There were no ekfrasis poems, but maybe they should start? They have a deadline of September 15 and everyone from our class should send 3-5 poems. The publication comes out of Greensboro North Carolina. Pick up a copy, read it and see if your stuff fits in. Sorry I have no comment on the story content. I'll write all the submission info if you want it, but you're better off buying it, reading it, then sending out.   J

      After spending five weeks in Europe one collects many things. My suitcase was full of dirty laundry, Majorcan pearls, scarves from the Prado, t-shirts from the University of Madrid, art copies from the Thyssen-Bornemisza and the Borghese, Spanish shawls, Italian candy, Swiss chocolate, a leather purse and a Paella pan for my ex-husband. My luggage was ominous.  On the last leg of the trip, I took a train from Rimini through Italy, Austria and on to Munich, (Munchin). The train car was a "fast train" which can mean many things in Italy, but it was German thereforw quite punctual.  It only started 45 minutes late.  I got my seat, but had to leave my luggage, otherwise known as "Bertha" in the aisle way. Bertha was blue, solid, locked, and hard to manage, I figured she would be safe a few feet away from me in the aisle. At the Bologna stop, there was total chaos on the train and she was gone.  I went after her, got off the train and tried to find her. I explained to the train hostess that I had to get off the train for a minute to pursue the thieves, she said we would leave in one minute with or without me. I needed no reminder that my other belongings, (computer, flight coupon, whatever I had left) were still on the train, and I decided to cut bait, get back on and get help.  The only thing I had going for me was that my compartment-mate spoke German, English and Italian and could help me get my point across. At first she told me to see the train "chef" and I wondered if he was the thief, then I realized that she meant "Chief," anyway, the results were no bag, but I would have to make a police report once the train stopped in Munchin.  My new friend, Lizzie from Dusseldorf, tried to cheer me up, noting that I no longer had to worry about lugging bags, someone had to sniff my dirty laundry, and that I could now shop for all new things at home! We talked about travels, shared food and fell asleep for bits of time over the next 9 hours. Although I didn't cry, my whole body felt knotted, especially my stomach.  Once at Munchin, Lizzie offered to help me find the police station and to explain in German that I needed to make a report. The female officer that she spoke to was very helpful and assured her (in German) that she would help me. Liz left to Dusseldorf and I started filling out paperwork. I filled out the forms, but was gripped with abdominal pain and had to use the toilet. I tried in German, then asked for the bathroom in Spanish. "Tienes Servicios" and she said, "you can use English." I was quite surprised.  It was bad and really stunk up the bathroom, but I couldn't find a way to flush. After looking high and low and pressing every thing, I ended up explaining to the officer that I was sick and couldn't find how to flush the toilet. She said, "That's ok, we all use it and we don't flush because the flush is outside." Clearly, she didn't understand what I did to the bathroom. I re-explained and she went off to take care of it for me.  Mortification, the stress of being gone 5 weeks, losing everything, and still having a flight to catch in another place, made me want to cry. Left alone in her office, I drifted from self-pity to exhaustion, and my mind started to drift. On the second desk was a name tag I couldn't believe: Assmann. I started to smile. I tried to figure out how you say it in German, and it still comes out Assmann. I may have lost my stuff, but at least I won't have to go through life as "The Assmann of Munchin!"  or,"The Assmann Cometh!" or in Beatles style "I am the Assmann, I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob!"  It didn't really matter how long it took for the paperwork, or what would happen at that point. I smiled all the way to the airport and giggled on the 17 hours that led me home.
