       This is my ambivalence  My pain and suffering It wont go away It nags at me every day Its trying to get me down And i hate to admit it But its succeeding  Dragging me down Back to the lowest, The lowest of all prisons And now, once again I'm chained to my own mind And&nbsp;pulled between 2 beleifs

      I don't know what to do, im lost inside myself, looking for the answers Trying to form an argument, one that’ll get me off the hook Trying to escape the pain, trying to save myself, trying to do it my way  And…  I wanna hurt myself Just for the sake of livin’ I wanna save myself By hurting I wanna stop this pain With different pain  There’s no help I can find, but only cos I don't seem to want it Even if I need it bad. Im trying to help myself, at the same time im masking the me Trying to escape their eyes, trying to hide away Trying to do it my way  Cos  I wanna hurt myself Just for the sake of livin’ I wanna save myself By hurting I wanna stop this pain With different pain  Im gonna gain some strength, gonna rescues myself, Gonna try anyways Gonna try to improve myself, now im gonna help someone Try to help a friend, she says she’s considering my way It melted me-I was useless   Now (repeat 3X) I wanna hurt myself Just for the sake of livin’ I wanna save myself By hurting I wanna stop this pain With different pain
