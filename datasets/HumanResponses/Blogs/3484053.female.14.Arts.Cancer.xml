      Went to the Red Barn. Got the ballet shoes. All was well.  Stopped at McDonalds on the way home. I ended up paying for the food, and Mom payed me back with what she had. She still ows me $3.00 - don't worry, I won't let her forget. >=) I will nag, gosh dernit. So, anyway, I got a Happy Meal [again, because of the toy] and got a red aisha! And then I was happy.  However, then I lost my Mercury gem for my uber-special Sailor Moon watch in the car and now I am devestated. Oh well, it's in there somewhere. Maybe I'll be Jupiter today instead of Mercury...  Tonight we're [hopefully] going to Books-A-Million. Manga galore! :O Happiness. I'd rather go to the mall, but...that's long closed. Stupid Sunday. Stupid early-closing stores. Grrr. >_>  So Michelle, Billy AND Meghan are going to all be seeing Wicked before Kristin Chenoweth leaves. I hate them. I hate them all >_>  But not so much Meghan - she said she'd get Kristin to sign something or another for me >=3 Fwahahahahaha.  My butt hurts from sitting. >_o  I went on a font downloading spreeee! I got some really good ones, too, and with them created a webpage layout. I'm very proud of it, too. It's all monochrome and awesome.   But I need to download a Hiragana font. I downloaded a Kanji font, but I can't read Kanji. I can read  Hiragana . So right after I'm done typing this, I'm going on a crazy search for one.  ...Pfft, why am I still typing? I'm off to get that font >_>

      I've only been awake for 30 minutes, and I'm already bored to tears. Nothing to do online. Nothing to do in reality. It's sad.  Today we're going to the Red Barn to get white ballet shoes for Sound of Music. I guess I need them for one of my dresses or something. I'm not that fond of the Red Barn. It's fleamarket >_> Yeah, they have an anime/manga store that tends to have some freaking awesome stuff, but... it's always so hot in there, and full of stupid people buying cheap crap.   Yesterday was Tony's birthday. He and his girlfriend came over for dinner/cake. I swear, that woman  never shuts up!  She goes on and on and on about little things and...ugh. It's annoying. But the cake was good. Julie and I made it. Mwahahahaha >=D It was devils food cake with chocolate icing, and REALLY sweet. Julie got her fingers caught in the beaters while we were making it. XD She was like "See, Ryan, you can't do this because it's really dangerous -" The next thing you know, her fingers are stuck between the beaters. She turns to mom and, laughing, says "Tami? It hurts."  So that was fun. Then we had cheese and crackers. That was fun too. I missed cheese and crackers. That came about when we went to Walmart and were pestering Mom about lunchables. She finally said we'd make our own...and we did. Awesome for us.  And....after writing all that, I'm still bored. -falls over-

      Such a lazy day. I really haven't been motivated to do anything but lay around all day. Nothing at all. In fact, I think the only thing I did today was go to McDonalds. In my Pajamas. It was fun. o_0 We only went for the toys. I got a Chomby.   So...this is my first entry and you know it owns.

      I am  so bored!  -headdesk- Mom and Ryan are out seeing Prisoner of Azkaban. I already saw it earlier today, but I was going to go again tonight... but the showing was sold out. =/ The one I went to today was sold out, too. Huzzah for Fandango! :D I ended up sitting on the floor so that I could sit with people I knew. Julie and I are going to go sometime this weekend, though, so...that's good.  The movie was awesome. When Hermione punched Draco in the face, the ENTIRE theater clapped xD I love it when they do that. It was darker, but it was also funnier, if that makes sense. Hm.  I'm gonna go beat my head on the wall some more. Update again later.
