      in three minutes. My manager is the biggest doof in the land. His waist is on the expansive side. Reminiscent of many of my uncles. Big, round and short. If he didn't say bro all the time I would swear he was Mexican.  Hawaiian and jolly. His laid back nature and go with the flow nature is what helped him out in the sales business. It seems very unnatural to see and hear him try to assert authority. He knows what he's doing and it appears to be one of those situations where once you piss of the nice guy who knows what will happen. He tries to joke with everyone. To be their friend and I have to say that at times it's a little forced. As far as urging people to respond to his little jokes and boosts of confidence.  My other manager is a tall, dorky and heavy-footed white man. Bad hair cut or lack thereof and simple business style. He laughs at his own jokes as well as everyone else's funny or not which brings me to think that he is a little insecure.  The laugh of insecurity...The biggest way to show that you are trying to please. I knew a guy who was so insecure he would laugh after nearly everything he said. That way if anyone thought what he was saying was stupid it wouldn't matter since he could mask it as a joke.  I try to please those that matter to me. Yet those that don't matter I disregard as extras in the movie of my life. Why bother with the passing girl behind me, or the guy sitting at the desk four away from me. The are inessential and their opinions of me don't bother me. I do however get bothered when those I've deemed worthy shun me a little. I try to not analyze it so much but it does get past my filter's sometimes.

      since I've had sex.  I used to marvel at people who would say that it's been a year.  Shit..I still do.  Now though....I'm beginning to see just how it IS possible to go without carnal intimacy for an extended period of time.  I have to say...  I blows like nothing else to be horny and all you want is a good fuck.  Not getting yourself off.   That just isn't the same.  You want a good laying.  Hard and good and a long night of sex.   It shouldn't be that hard to get some right?  Being a girl in San Francisco.  The land of the single people.  Of course of all those single people there are only a few which pass the standards of my selective tastes.  That small group seems to be the most unattainable herd of cattle to corral into one area to take my pick of the prime meat.  Lower my standards, right?  Hmm...a possibility.  Do I really need a guy who is at least my height?  I would like it if my toes didn't hit his shins as I was laying next to him.  Then there's the body...can I do a guy if he was soft around the edges?  I think I could...I'm not exactly a rock climber either so a little give isn't too bad.  He can't however be blond and blue eyed...I don't know why but a blond blue eyed guy just doesn't do it for me.  I like the exotic look, mixed nationality guys....mmm....yummy.  Then there's the one guy who I'm into enough but he can't keep it hard.  Not fun.  At all.  He said he didn't know why it happened...It was a go for the first 15 minutes but then....down hill.  A second attempt was made...Houston we have a problem.   Third strike you're out...or not...twice is all I could try...a third time failing would just give me a complex of not being able keep him hard.
