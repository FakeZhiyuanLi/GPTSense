      Earlier this month, I traveled to Ann Arbor, Michigan to see the  urlLink Comedy Central  tour starring Lewis Black and Dave Attell.  If you’ve ever watched Comedy Central you have certainly seen one or both of them as they are on it quite frequently.  Dave Attell hosts the popular show, Insomniac, where he travels to different cities and stays up all night, drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and taking pictures of various people that he parties with.  Lewis Black appears every Wednesday on  urlLink The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , and is a scream.  Literally – he screams about everything.  Ann Arbor, for those who don't know, is very very liberal in general and is home to the annual Hash Bash.    Going to this event was a last minute decision – specifically, when I found out Mitch Hedberg was going to be opening.  I suggest you check out his  urlLink website  for some clips.    I didn’t have a date so I went by myself and had a grand time.  My 7th row seat did not disappoint.  Mitch Hedberg was hilarious as I anticipated.  A few of his new jokes were met with mediocre laughs from the crowd so he started to beat himself up.  He even laughed to make up from the lack of laughter coming from the audience (is it just me, or is it funny when a comic busts out on stage?).  After he publicly berated himself for those few jokes, he announced that he would be turning it up a notch and started with the really funny stuff.  He had a brief pause and people in the crowd started yelling out requests – apparently, they watch Comedy Central as much as I do.  Mitch railed through a few requests that weren’t on his list and after that he was on a roll for another 10 minutes.  Really, I would have paid the ticket price to see Mitch alone, but he was gone after about a 30 minute set.  Dave Attell was next and his raunchy brand of comedy was loved by the crowd.  His style is so funny - telling jokes but in that way where you don't really know it's the punchline, until you think about it for a while :).  I can't repeat any of his jokes, but he was shockingly hilarious.  Lewis Black was the last act of the night, and he came out with his gloves on.  Black gets angry at pretty much anything - he was jumping up and down and screaming about the snow that Northern Michigan had already seen this fall.  He also gets very angry when talking about politics.  Lew was talking about how when Bush came into office in 2001, there was a $52 trillion budget surplus.  Now, 2 years later, there's a $52 trillion deficit.  (Don't quote me on those numbers...)  He asked if we are really any better off after all that money was pissed away, where did it go, do you have a nicer house now because I don't and so on.  Someone in the back stood up and yelled, "The country is much safer now!!!"    Lew paced the stage like a wolf waiting to pounce on its prey.  The crowd was just in complete shock.  Lew screamed back at him, "Have you ever heard my act before?  You have no idea what you are talking about."  He paced around the stage again, and said, "Listen, asshole, I don't like Republicans, but I don't like Democrats either.  The only difference between Republicans and Democrats is that while Republicans have bad ideas, Democrats have no ideas."    Lewis then walked around a little more obviously trying to cool himself off.  He returned to his act and the show returned to normal.  He referenced "jackass heckler" a couple other times in the next 20 minutes or so when he was talking about the war in Iraq and "war on Terror" and said that's why "jackass heckler" thinks it's a safer place - because we are attacking other countries to make our own safer.   That was the last straw for the heckler who stood up again and yelled, "Mitch Hedberg was funnier than you".  Someone closer to the front turned and yelled, "Then leave!" which the heckler then did - but then Lewis said, "I know Mitch is funnier - that's why we brought him out on tour with us."     The crowd went wild when the guy finally left.    I can't imagine what would cause someone to heckel the angriest guy on the planet, but it definitely made for an interesting show.  Lewis finished up strong although you could tell he was shaken.    I watched the people who were there to see the late show and wondered if they'd see anything remotely like what we saw.

      If you are looking for a sound investment, put up a parking garage next to a theater that has concerts and other special events.  Preferably with 6 floors or more.  Have 4 cashier stands.  Charge by the hour.  During normal working hours, have 3 or 4 cashier stations open.  When there is a special event, only have one cashier open.  That way, people are stuck in the garage trying to get out, and you’re making more money to have less staff.

      Insomnia seems to be a big spiral - once I get one night of crappy sleep, I start worrying about not sleeping enough, and then it goes on for a week or so.  This phase started Sunday night.  I usually have a hard time going to bed on Sunday, just because I have so many thoughts about the upcoming week and it's hard to shut them off.  This Sunday night was strange though because I had to get up early for my job duties, so it turned into "I need to sleep soon or else I will only have 4 hours of sleep" and so on.  I think I did get about 4 hours, but it was mostly after I got up "early", did the job duties that needed to be done, then went back to bed.   This of course makes it hard to sleep Monday night.  Last night I just got up around 4:30 and sat and watched TV for a while, and looked at the laptop for a bit.  Then I went back to bed, and finally fell asleep around 6.  Tonight looks like it's going to be the same routine.  I'm taking the Doctor's advice in Fight Club and swigging some Valerian and just trying to unwind and hope that helps.

       urlLink 311  is touring again this fall in support of their new album,  urlLink Evolver .   I have not missed a 311 tour since 1999 - well, just once when we were gone on our  urlLink honeymoon , but not besides that.  I was kind of bumming because they are in Michigan 4 times this fall!  And I wasn't going to be able to go to any - you know, save money and all.  Well some things fell into place at the right time, and I found out today that I am going to be able to see them on Saturday at Central Michigan!  The tickets are way cheap (like, 2 tickets for the price that I paid for 1 this past summer's tour) and my husband and I are going to be down in the area anyway for business on that day.    WOO HOO!

      I work at home, and the TV is almost always on in the background.  Today,  urlLink Ocean's 11  was on, and that makes me think of other great movies that I can watch over and over.    I like Ocean's 11 because the cast is great (save for Julia Roberts, I despise her role in this film), and the script is witty... I love to hate Andy Garcia in this movie.  Brad Pitt never hurts a film, either :).   urlLink Fight Club  is also a movie that I watch at least three times a month.  If you haven't seen it you need to go do that now.  I love Pitt in this movie, too, and Edward Norton is great.  Same for these:  urlLink Shawshank Redemption  - Tim Robbins ownz in this Stephen King novella-turned-movie  urlLink Office Space  - the definitive computer company/disgruntled employee movie  urlLink Billy Madison  and  urlLink Happy Gilmore  - classic Sandler  urlLink High Fidelity  - John Cusack and Jack Black, what else do you need?  urlLink The Whole Nine Yards  - I think this one bombed at the box office, but I still love it. Matthew Perry is great as the nervy dentist.  So, go on over to Blockbuster or the competing local chain and pick these up this weekend.  The weather isn't that great this time of year, anyway, so what else are you gonna do? :)

       urlLink Brooklynn Alexandra  was born on Sunday morning to our friends Scott and Sara.  Visit the page (follow the Brooklynn link) for some pics of the little cutie!  I wonder if anyone will call her Gabby Gibbons like her Great-Grandma suggested ;).   Maybe once she starts talking.  Sara and Scott will be super parents.  Chad and I will get to meet little Brooklynn when we are down for Thanksgiving next week - but I want to see her now! :)  Congrats to Sara and Scott and all the grandparents (and great-grandparents).

      Driving the 200 miles down to my mom's house yesterday took about twice as long as it normally does....   My car has had a bit of a thumping sound in the rear-right side, and Chad and I were planning to have it looked at after the first of the year.  The thumping seemed to subside as I was driving down I-75 so I was thinking things were fine.  Then at the halfway point north of Bay City, my tire blew out.  I knew right away it was the tire and got pulled over safely (thankfully).  I tried to see what the problem was, and about 4"x2" of the tire was gone - no more rubber, just steel sticking out.  It was pretty impressive looking.  I freaked out, though, because it was scary and plus you're never safe on the side of the road (especially on I-75).. got back in the car.  I called Chad, then my Mom, then tried to call the insurance company.  Then a state cop pulled up behind me.  At this point I was basically having a panic attack (although this was not the first time I panicked with a cop behind my car  ).  Since the air was not really gone out of the tire yet, he just followed me on the side of the road to the next exit.  He was really nice and cool, especially considering I was a basket case.  Once we got to the gas station he made sure I was calm, and that I had someone I could call to come put on the spare, and was outta there.  Thanks, anonymous Cop! :)    I called roadside assistance and the guy was immediately on his way.  In the meantime, though, about 4 other guys offered to help, which was nice (and totally unexpected).  So, thanks, anonymous guys who offered to help!  The tow truck guy was very helpful and I was back on the road within an hour of the incident.  Of course, on a donut spare, you can't drive very fast so that was quite the adventure.  Driving on I-75 in Michigan is fine if you can go 80 with the rest of the traffic... when you're stuck at 55MPH it's pretty scary... especially when the Fudgies are heading back home with their huge snowmobile trailers in tow.  About a half hour later, the check engine light came on.  I was about ready to lose it again!  I've never had anything happen (except getting pulled over once or twice) on the drive to my Mom's and it just seemed like all hell was breaking lose all at once.  Chad said things were probably fine, so I just kept driving.  I made it home 5.5 hours after I left.    I was shaking like a leaf and I didn't sleep at all last night.  It's scary when you don't know what's wrong with the car!  Especially when our other subaru is in Texas with my husband, and this car is supposed to drive us around for the next month (and down to Texas in January).  And, my subaru has been nearly trouble-free since we got it 3 years ago... and with 130,000 miles on it who knows what could be wrong.    I got up at the crack of dawn (actually, I don't think the sun was up yet) and went to the dealer nearby.  They charged me $40 to hook the car up to a little scanner thing.  The little scanner thing said that it was a catalytic converter problem.  Apparently that can cost $1000 to replace.    But, the lady at the dealership said that it might have been a fluke, and she wanted me to see if the light came back on again before jumping the gun to replace it.  It blows my mind that an error like that could be a fluke, but I was happy to be able to get out of the service department for $40.  On to the tire problem - my Dad and Mom said that if we needed all 4 tires replaced they would pay for them for Christmas.  My Dad called one of his connections around here  and I went and got all the tires replaced.  He almost put some snow tires on until I told him we were moving.  Dad also asked Jerry to look at the Catalytic converter.. which turned out to be fine, as far as they could tell.  So anyway, thanks Mom and Dad for saving my rear on this one.  We always seem to have some catastrophe happen Christmas week (last year, our Washer flooded our basement), and without Mom and Dad we'd be driving on a cheap tire down to Texas.  Now, back to work :).

      I wanted to be a teacher when I was a kid.  At some point, I think it was when I got into golf in high school, I decided I wanted to teach golf.  Well, that didn't work out :) and I'm in computers.  I would argue that the kids of the world are better off, because I'm a bit cranky in the morning :)...  But I had a great reminder today of how badly I wanted to be a teacher.    My  urlLink high school  golf coach was also a science teacher.  I never had him in any class, just for golf.  He is the most unbelievable person on the planet.  I just adore him; he's a scream to talk to, great at lifting your spirits when you're down (and even if you don't realize you are), and he was a great golf coach.  When I was a freshman, the golf program was dying.  He started coaching us my sophomore year and really turned the program around.  By the time I graduated, two of us were medalists in our conference and our team as a whole did very well.  It's been 8 years since I graduated (sigh...) but I call Mr. G about once or twice a year to check in and see how he's doing and vice versa.  I wish that I could bottle up how great it is to talk to him and save it for those "rainy days".  Mr. G always has a funny story and loves to recount embarrassing stories from when I would come into his office all those years ago, or stories about the golf course, or the time I got locked in his car and the car alarm was armed... you can imagine.    I can't imagine being in a position to have that type of effect on someone's life.  He's a grandpa now, and about to retire from teaching after 38 years.  Even though no new students will learn from him, the old students won't soon forget the impact he's had.  Thanks, Mr. G!

      Chad is currently somewhere in Illinois, driving toward Texas.  He volunteered to go down early, check out the condo, job interview, etc.  Send any extra positive mojo to Chad for the long drive (by himself!) and for the job interview and such.  For what it's worth, I think this is the longest we have ever been apart.  I know, "poor babies."  He will be leaving his Subaru down in Texas and flying back to Michigan right before Christmas.  Then we'll see my folks on Christmas Eve, his folks on Christmas Day, and then resume getting ready for the move.  I can't believe it's coming up so fast!  The holidays always seem to fly by and it will be January 21st before we know it.

      Sign me up for a 12-step program to rip me away from Melrose.  This show is so awesome!  Reruns are on  urlLink The Style Network  nightly at 6PM Eastern.  I didn't watch the show the first time it was out (too young for this kind of trash back then ;)).  If you're stuck at home this winter and nothing better to do, this is definitely an entertaining way to go.

      Well, we are finally moving.  We've been planning this for over a year!  We're tired of waiting for our house to sell, and as silly as it is to pay a mortgage AND rent, we're going to do it.    Vacating our house, let the realtor sell it, and get the heck out of here.  The moving company will be here on January 21 and we'll be driving down with our cat...   This is really exciting and nerve-wracking.. we've been planning the move longer than we spent planning our wedding!  So, it's scary and exciting all at the same time.  It will be weird to only have half of a winter this year.  "Buh-bye" snow! :)

      Well, went to the 311 concert on Nov 22 down in Mt Pleasant, Michigan.  (Fire up,  urlLink Chips !)    It was awesome!  The place was packed.  As reported earlier, this was my tenth time seeing them and they were in top form.  There were a gazillion people there and we were in the upper bowl, but we could see everything because we were directly next to the stage.  P-Nut is my favorite member of the band - I just really love his style of playing but mainly for the way he interacts with the crowd at the shows, and his stance on issues like war and politics.  It's nice to look up to someone who stands for something.  Especially in the music industry today, that doesn't happen often.  After the show we found the buses and waited.  There were a ton of 18 and 19 year old blond girls there who presumably just wanted to meet Nick (the commonly known "hottie" of the band, and also the lead singer).  I've met Nick before, and yes, he's hot, but I was hoping to see someone else, too :).  After about 30 minutes of freezing, Nick did come out.  He was bombarded by the hooch patrol, and I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.  So, I sat there and sulked for a while like the big baby that I am.  Chad said, "Come on, let's go" but at that point I'd waited and froze so long I really didn't want to go away empty handed.    Next thing you know, P-Nut is walking over.  I zipped over to the barricade and was so excited to see him.  I didn't think he was coming out since I'd heard he was out before the show to meet people, too.  Everyone was asking P-Nut questions, like How's the wife, etc.  I asked him if there were any little P-Nuts in their future.  He smiled and said, "Someday" and gave a little laugh.  It was really funny.  I was wearing my brick red Evolver shirt which he signed and I plan to wear that to the 311 Day show in March.  I also asked for a hug, and he gave me a big one.  I told him how much I appreciated the band and that they are awesome.  I swear, I turn into such a drooling fanboy around them.   Chad was watching from the sidelines and saw me get a hug from P-nut, and was smiling when I made my way back out.  We then decided to get something signed for my sister Karen, who is also a huge fan but couldn't be at the show.  Chad went up to P-Nut and shook his hand, and P-Nut signed a ticket for Karen (it was for her birthday on  the 26th).  Chad also thanked him for reading "our emails".. P-Nut kind of did a double take and said, "Keep 'em coming!"  A couple days later, he did respond to our message which was also very neat.  It's so awesome to see a band that takes time out for the fans, even when it's freezing outside and they have a busy week coming up.  Thanks P-Nut and 311!

      Then we could afford this move to Texas :).  Just kidding.  We are here, and safe, and I have started my new job.  Everything is super! :)  We should have our furniture and such on Thursday, then my employer's post-holiday party is Saturday, and next week Chad starts his job at  urlLink Don Davis Auto Group  over in Grapevine.    The drive down was pretty much as expected.  It's about 4 hours from Little Rock, Arkansas... seemed like it would just be a "stone's throw" from there (which it was, compared to the rest of the drive) ;).  We did it in about 20 hours total.   Lexus was meowing until we reached Grand Rapids, then her meds kicked in and she was more or less out of it until about midnight (that's 10 hours into the trip for those of you who are counting), and then she howled on and off the rest of the way.  I figured out somewhere in Arkansas that she was quiet if she thought we were sleeping, so I had to hold totally still while driving at 4:00 in the morning :).  But, she was (eventually) fine when we arrived.  Our apartment is really nice!  It's more of a townhome than an apartment.  There is so much storage I can't believe it!  The fact that all we have right now is a bed and a couple chairs and suitcases probably makes it seem much bigger than it is, but that's ok.  It's nice to be here and get used to our new environment, even without our nice new furniture from the  urlLink Spud .    Chad has been an angel and is running lots of errands.  He went and got his car inspected (a requirement in Texas before you can get plates), then got his plates (a requirement in Texas before you can get your drivers license), and today got his license.  While Texas has no State Income Tax, these types of errands can add up quickly.  Today, he took my car to get new brakes, and an inspection, and an oil change.  This is after we had to restock our Liquor collection (the moving company won't move alcohol), and purchase miscellaneous things for the apartment, including some nice wireless networking equipment.  Hence the reference to the million dollars above.    It's wild being down here but for some reason it still doesn't feel real.  I've had visits this long so maybe that's why, or maybe because our furniture is still in parts unknown ;).  Everyone here has been super, that Southern Hospitality is really nice to be around :).  The weather has been stellar for the most part - Saturday we had rain and it was like 55 all day, and then Sunday it was 75 and sunny.  As we were out and about on Saturday running more errands (and spending more money, [g]), someone said, "How do you like this weather?"  We just adore this weather! :)  Today it was a bit cold, about 23 when I left for work.  Made me feel like I was back in Michigan for a little while :).  So we are safe and here and have a roof over our heads.  More stories to follow.

      As we are finishing up the packing process, we have donated two large truck loads of furniture/clothes/VHS movies/etc to local charities and just filled up a 6-yard dumpster with crap.  For the last two months our discussions have been focused on moving and packing and bartering who can keep what and if we should give this away or throw it out and such.  I have a box of trophies that I have not done anything with in the 8 years since I moved out of my folks' house.  It just moves around with us.  Mostly golf trophies but some bowling and basketball ones, too.  Chad wonders why I keep it if I never open the box.  There's a big one that I have from 1996 that doesn't fit in the box and it's pretty dinged up.  I tried to throw it away yesterday...  [tangent] I've written a little bit about golf here  urlLink before  but I forget sometimes how important golf was to my younger years.  I was planning to go to  urlLink Ferris State  to participate in their Pro Golf Management program - so I could be a member of the Michigan PGA and be a teaching/club pro.    The PGM program there is one of two in the country (or was at the time) and is not easy to get into.  I was on the wait list to get in January of 1996.  The plan was to go to FSU for one semester of general study, then get into that program and get out of school in 4-5 years.  Well it didn't happen all like that, obviously, I decided for many reasons (but my high school boyfriend was the biggest one) to stay home and commute to  urlLink Oakland University .  Most of my friends from high school were doing that anyway.    After my 2 years of being captain of Mott's golf team, and having the school record, and being 7th in the county my senior year, I went to Oakland and played golf and didn't play very well.  OU's course is much harder than PCC (our home course in high school) and the girls on the team were much better.  I don't really remember why I quit now, but suspect it was because I felt like I couldn't compete.  I was the only freshman on the team so I should have given myself a break, but you know how that can be.    But before I gave up competitive golf for good, there was the Oakland County Junior golf tournament that is held every year at the Oakland County courses.  It's 36 holes if memory serves.  You had to be 19 or younger to play in it.  The courses are nice.. the entry fee was low ;), and every year I got to play against girls from the rival high school in Waterford.  1996 was different because I was a year removed from high school, but I still relished kicking those other girls' butts.  One in particular who shall remain nameless here - she was everything I wasn't on the golf course, loud, brash, and rude.  Being a purist when it comes to golf I can't stand that type of behavior.    She graduated when I did in '95 and this would be the last time we would ever compete.  She was decent at golf - although she didn't have the fundamentals down like I did, we were always pretty closely matched.    The two-day tournament ended after 36 holes with A---- and I tied.  We had to go to sudden death playoff!  These tournaments are self-scored, you play with a group of 3 or 4 and score yourself (with checks and balances in place by the other competitors).  However for sudden death, the judges and some "fans" and someone from the local paper followed us.  What an incredible moment to beat someone I've golfed against and with for about 6 years in front of all those people and have it covered in the paper.  It was one of the highlights of my golf career :).    [/tangent] When I went to throw this trophy out I wanted to tell Chad about winning it and what it meant to me to beat that person in head to head competition in front of everyone.  I burst into tears!  I was overcome with emotion at the memory and missing the competition and really, missing playing golf regularly.  It was so much like a Bruce Springsteen song I was laughing about it.   He wouldn't let me throw it away because it was too hard.  It's funny how memories sneak up on you like that and you think you are ready to let go of something, but you're really not.   I don't regret the decision to not pursue golf - if I had been away at Ferris I would not have met Chad... but sometimes it's hard not to look back and wonder what might have been.

      Well it's not quite that frantic yet, but the 21st is quickly approaching and we are getting ready.  I can't wait to be moved :).  Our furnace broke last night, THAT was frantic... at least it wasn't as cold as it was on Friday.  We made it through the night ok, have a temporary fix running now, and hopefully can get the part needed to fix the problem without replacing the whole thing.    Other than that, just packing, working, shoveling snow... lather, rinse, repeat.  We've been saying "byes" to people since Christmas Eve and that hasn't been easy.  I've been a Michigan resident since I was born, and Chad has been since he was 3 or 4, so it's strange to be leaving.  I am so excited... can't wait to leave the snow, too :).  Anyway, updates will be sparse for a while, so we can disconnect cable here, move, then get cable ASAP when we get to the townhome.  We won't have any furniture or anything to do, so we will need Internet :).   p.s. Happy Birthday Pam! :)

      Just like probably everyone my age or thereabouts (and probably beyond), I can't believe it's 2004.  This means, 1984 was 20 years ago!  My youngest sister was born in '84 so obviously that means she will be 20 this year, which is very... well, hard to believe. :)  Chad and I celebrated the end of 2003 by going to  urlLink TraVino , a nice Italian restaurant down the way a bit in Acme.  He had wine and I had some "travinis" with a yummy dinner.  We headed to the video store and grabbed some DVDs, and were on the couch watching Terminator to ring in 2004.  Last night, we watched Terminator 2.  (Might as well get caught up on 1 and 2 before I see 3, since I barely remember those movies.)  About 5 minutes before the end of the movie, the power flashed.  Then it flashed again.  We waited a few minutes, then turned the TV back on to finish the movie.  15 minutes later, the power flashed 3x more, then went completely out.  Besides the havoc this must have been on Chad's Dell in the other room ;), it was wild scrambling around to find candles in this house which is torn apart in preparation for the move later this month.    As we sat in the dark for a bit, Chad was facing the front window towards the shopping center in front of our sub.  There was this repetitive blue/green flash of light coming from over there.  By "flash of light" I mean "light that lit up the whole sky".  It happened 3 or 4 times, then stopped, and nothing the rest of the night.  If the porch/roads/driveway weren't a sheet of ice we might have gone to see what was up, which would probably have been a bad idea.  Someone probably took out a telephone pole due to the slippery conditions.  I still don't know what it was because when I drove past this afternoon I forgot to look ;).    Anyway the power came back on at 6AM, plenty of time to tape the Melrose Place rerun that was on at 10 ;).

      ... a week makes.  Last Saturday the  urlLink Metroplex  saw its biggest snowstorm in about 25 years (4 inches at the airport).  This Saturday it's as sunny as can be and pushing 70 degrees.  I love it!  Things have been insane around here.  Chad and I are both working a ton - he's at work now.  All the car sales people work on Saturday.  Makes sense since that's the biggest sales day.  He's been fighting off a cold thing - must be the crappy weather all week (60s or higher since Wednesday) ;).  He's sold a couple cars already and building some momentum :).  I'm working 10 hour or so days as well as we prepare for a major release around the first of March.  I absolutely love it though.  The cat has adjusted just fine - she's liking all the sun and the birds in our apartment complex.  I think she misses us being gone all day since we used to all be home all the time, but she's a cat, so she might just be looking for more food when she howls when we walk in the door.    We are unpacked and finally the money spending has died down :).  Now all we need to do is sell that  urlLink house  in Kalkaska. ;)

      On our way home from  urlLink Krispy Kreme  (breakfast) on Sunday, I ran over a bird that had swooped in front of me to get something on the road.  Presumably it was food.  It all happened so quickly...  I feel bad for the little bird.  The road was pretty much clear besides me - church hadn't let out yet.  I got pretty upset and Chad offered to drive, and he was supportive and helped me through it.  I know I'm (too?) sensitive to things like that.  I'm grateful that my husband understands how things like that upset me and doesn't make fun of me or make light of the situation.    I can't help though, but think of the irony of it all.  (Glad I'm not posting this on  urlLink Fark's  comments board because I'd get eaten alive for talking about Irony.)  Chad and I went to Krispy Kreme for breakfast.  As most people know, I was on  urlLink Atkins  last year and lost 46 pounds.  I've been struggling to get back at it and have put some of the weight back on, unfortunately.  So, as Chad and I were returning from a pig out session of donuts (and milk, gasp!), I ran over a bird who was probably trying to feed his family.  The bird doesn't really have a choice as far as "Should I eat junk food today?" "Should I feed my family a quality meal?"  The bird (presumably, again) just grabs whatever is availble and what he thinks will do the job.  Why is it so hard for me (and a lot of other people who struggle with diet and eating issues) to have that same type of attitude toward food?  Really, what does it matter whether something tastes good or not, as long as it's edible and has some nutritional value.  Given the choice (there's that word again) between macaroni and cheese or a plate of veggies, I will take the mac and cheese every time.  I'll also eat McDonald's for breakfast, when I could just as easily have a hard-boiled egg or two.    It would also be different if eating McDonald's for breakfast or mac and cheese didn't make me feel crappy, but it does.  First I feel full from undoubtedly eating way too much.  Then I feel guilty for eating something that's bad for me.  Then I want to sleep from eating so many carbs.  Why is this such a struggle?

      This being my first year in Texas, I'm seeing a lot of really different things that I'm not used to from living in Michigan for so long.  First, there was this huge spider (it had hair, I am not kidding) in my office yesterday.  Yikes!  It was about the size of a quarter with tiny little stubby legs.  Yuck.  When looking out the window behind my desk there is this tree that has the most incredible purple flowers coming up already.  The grass is already turning green(er), and landscapers have already done their first round of lawn work. This is a far cry from where our house is, where I think the snow may finally be almost all melted :).  I love it here.  Work has been insane for Chad and I both, but that doesn't matter.  I'm finally where I want to be and working with the people I want to be working with.  I think he's enjoying his job too although it's taking him longer to get acclaimated - of course - he's not worked with his co-workers for 5 years like I have.    The only real problem right now is our house hasn't sold, but we are hoping that will happen soon.  The house is immaculate, and spring is eventually going to start up there.  It'd be nice to have that monkey off our backs and the extra $1000 or so a month it costs.

      Chad and I joined  urlLink 24-hour fitness  this week.  Along with my diet I need to get in shape, and hopefully that will lead to more weight loss :).  I have never really gone to a gym besides here and there so this is really different for me.  We've gone 3 days in a row and I am in pain... AND I gained two pounds since Monday!  My friend Andrew reminded me today that muscle weighs more than fat, but I wonder if I've got any muscle yet?  My body is rebelling from this new health kick in any way it can and it knows if the scale starts going up, I'll quit and go back to my couch-sitting, laptop-using, tv-watching ways.     Anyway the gym is really nice.  I like it a LOT better than  urlLink Bally  - not just the facility itself but Bally was much more desparate for my business.  I hate when places call you over and over and over and don't take a hint.

      When I was about 14, I heard of a golfer at Arizona State University.  He was an incredible talent, and a very genuine person.  You could see his personality shine through as he walked down the fairways showing a big toothy grin.   I met him when I was 16 at the  urlLink Buick Open  in Grand Blanc, Michigan.  At the time I was star struck and convinced I'd marry him someday :).  It was the Pro-Am day and because the crowds were sparse (he was not very popular then), I got to basically walk along side him for the entire tournament.  He signed whatever I asked him to and we had a picture taken together.  When I was 17 I sent him a letter telling him about my appreciation of him as a golfer and as a person, and told him about my blooming "career" in golf.  He responded with a warmly-signed 8x10, wishing me luck and telling me to keep practicing.  In 1996, I went to the US Open at Oakland Hills and saw him again, although I didn't get a chance to talk to him.  He is also a regular competitor at the  urlLink Par-Three Shootout  that is held every year in  urlLink Gaylord, Michigan .  His coach is  urlLink Rick Smith  -  who also taught Chad how to play golf (and was Chad's first boss).   I've gone to that event three times and each time at least get a smile from my fave golfer.  I don't try to get autographs from him anymore because I already have plenty.  My dreams of being a golfer have long since faded, but I still have a serious appreciation for the game.  I watch it as much as I can and almost never miss a major for the PGA tour.    For 12 years,  urlLink Phil Mickelson  has been a PGA tour member.  He has won over 20 tour events.  In some ways his success has been downplayed because Tiger Woods is so great and has won so often (and won more big tournaments).  For 12 years I have watched Phil and felt his pain as key mistakes (or bad breaks)  happened down the stretch in major tournaments.  Chad would know to leave me alone as I stared at the TV on Sunday four times a year, screaming, smiling, and willing Phil to win.  For at least 5 years Phil has been known as the "Best Player to Never Win a Major" and that has been a monkey that has not stopped riding him, and riding him hard.    Last year Phil's wife Amy gave birth to their third child.  Both she and Evan (their first son) almost died in childbirth.  Phil was more a zombie than a threat the rest of the season, and it was only his second year on tour that he didn't have at least one win.    Now Amy and Evan are both healthy and Phil has rededicated himself to the game.  He's working out and taking better care of himself.     urlLink The Masters  was about ten days ago and Phil finally had his break-through.  There was something different in the way he walked and carried himself throughout the weekend.  Instead of agonizing pain that was normally on his face on Sunday, he looked calm and smiled a lot.  I watched all day on the couch in shock at the different Phil I was seeing after all these years.  Phil was down by 3 shots on the back nine at one point, and he charged and won the tournament on a twenty-foot putt on the 18th hole.  I screamed and cried and laughed and clapped for about a half hour.  I swear, I don't know how Chad puts up with me sometimes.  When Phil hugged Amy and their kids, and picked up their daughter and said, "Daddy won, can you believe it?" I cried with them.  I think that because Phil is such an incredible spirit, and a giving person, that there were so many people that were just hoping that this would be his time.  I watched the winning putt and subsequent leap into the air over and over.  I watched Phil put on the green jacket, and smiled along with him as he just sat there and beamed.    You deserve it, Phil.  Thanks for all the years of entertainment and hope and inspiration.   See you at the US Open =).

      I turned 27 on Monday, April 5.  27 is a strange age... as are a lot of the ages that I've seen since turning 21.    Chad will be 29 in July.. that's scary! :)  Anyway, we celebrated at the bar and by going out to dinner.  I also ate way more cake and other sweets than anyone should consume in a two-day period.  (Back at the Low-carb thing today, though.)  My sister Pam was down here last week for her spring break.  We had a blast!  I'm just trying to recover now, before the  urlLink concert  on Tuesday in Austin.  Good times.  Springtime in Texas is something else.  Yesterday it was 85 and we went out on a friend's boat all afternoon (we got out early for Good Friday).  Eat that, Michigan!  Haha, just kidding.  All week when Pam was here last week it was between 70 and 80 and sunny the whole time.  Perfect!  Watch this space for whining about the heat in a couple months, though. :)  My friend and co-worker  urlLink Randy  is moving from here to Denver this week.  Good luck Randy!  We will all miss you and your quirkiness at our office :).  It's all good though because he will be telecommuting and we should still see him a few times a year.

      I am totally into the  urlLink NBA  playoffs this year.  I have been a  urlLink Pistons  fan for as long as I can remember (I think my first Pistons memory was with  urlLink Isiah Thomas , maybe in 1982 or 1983?), but haven't been watching them for a few years.    My friend Mouk is really into the  urlLink Mavericks  so I watched a game with him and suddenly I was sucked back in.  I haven't missed a Pistons game since (and have caught a lot of the other games, too).  It's cool because it's cheap entertainment ;).    Chad hates basketball and always has, but the triple-overtime Pistons vs.  urlLink Nets  game a couple weeks ago got him into it, too.   Go Pistons! :)

      I really wanted to come up with two more bad songs to finalize my  urlLink list  of "songs that make you want to stick your head in an oven" so without further ado here is number 2:    urlLink Don't Want to Miss a Thing   by   urlLink Aerosmith  .  This song is the main hit from one of the worst movies of all time,  urlLink Armageddon .  So, when you hear this song you get to remember that horrible atrocity of a film, as well as some really terrible lyrics:  I could stay awake just to hear you breathing Watch you smile while you are sleeping While you're far away dreaming  Oh, so this is apparently  Every Breath You Take , part 2?  But not nearly as cool.   Lying close to you feeling your heart beating And I'm wondering what you're dreaming Wondering if it's me you're seeing  Yes, because I can only dream of you?  If I'm in a cold sweat, maybe that's the case, since this makes me think you're a creep.  Next:  Then I kiss your eyes And thank God we're together I just want to stay with you in this moment forever Forever and ever  WTF?  Kiss my eyes while I'm sleeping?  Wouldn't that wake me up?  Unless I wasn't really sleeping and you murdered me - in which case perhaps this moment could really last "forever."

      Go see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 .  I don't care whether you're Republican, Democrat or other (like me), it's an important film that will open your eyes to some things that are going on.  I saw it tonight at the 9:55 show (we tried to see the 7:10 but it sold out before we all got tickets), and I don't think I'll be sleeping anytime soon.  In this film, there seemed to be less creative editing that was such a hot point for critics of  urlLink Bowling for Columbine .  Obviously there is still a spin on the movie, but he really lets the news footage/interviews speak out more so than in his last film.

       urlLink LYD  recently had a blog entry about the songs that make you want to stick your head in an oven.    While I could never be as eloquent as Ernie is when he talks about Candyman's  urlLink Knockin' Boots , I do have something I'd like to add.  I've been thinking about this for over a week - surely I can come up with 3 songs that make me want to die when I hear them!    So far, though, all I can think of is  urlLink Jump  by  urlLink Van Halen .  That song irks me to no end - the opening music is enough to send my blood pressure skyrocketing as I lunge for the radio in my car (or on the computer if I'm using Rhapsody) to get it as far away from my ears as possible.  I hate synthesizers in general, but this Van Halen tune takes my hatred for them to a whole new level.  Add that with crappy (DLR) lyrics, and the fact that this song has been in constant rotation since 1984, and you have the formula for a suicide attempt.

      The Pistons are one game away from winning the NBA championship.  I love that no one in the media (and a lot of people I know) thought that they had a chance - even I was hoping it wouldn't be a blow-out.  It appears that it might be a blow-out but in "our" favor, instead.  I'll be glued to the TV tonight, again, and hoping the Pistons pull it off!

      The battery is replaced on my car, and the cables fixed.  The Subaru dealership also washed that car as soon as it arrived to get rid of the battery acid.  I didn't even think that would have been a problem since I didn't see any!  But, apparently it was.  The front trim of the car under the headlight is missing some specs of paint where the acid splashed out.  I can touch that up, though, and in the big scheme of things it's not the worst thing that could have happened :).  At least my car is running and it didn't cost too much.  Special thanks to  urlLink Arlington Auto Mall  for turning my car around in about 5 hours with such short notice.  I think most of that time was washing it twice and waxing it though ;).

      I'm back in Arlington and back to work.  Well, getting to work this morning was difficult since my car wouldn't start.    Chad dropped me off at the office and Javier and I went back home to try to jump it.  We had to rig the gear shifter to get it out of park, then push it out of the garage.  I turned the key to start it after Javier hooked it up to his truck and *nothing*.  Javier moved something around, then I turned the key again. KAPOW!  The loudest sound you ever heard.  Battery blew up and smoked for a while.  At that point I just called the dealership to tow it.  I hope the car is ok and there's nothing seriously wrong with it.  Back to work..

      I'm up in Michigan visiting family and today my sister Karen and I went to see  urlLink 311 .  For those of you keeping track, this was my 11th time seeing them live (would have been 12 except we had to leave one concert in 2000 before they even came on stage.. long story).  Karen and I are pretty short and often have a hard time seeing the band up close because 311 shows are typically general admission.  This time at Pine Knob (whoops, I mean DTE Energy Music Theater), there were seats.  We decided to take a deal we found on  urlLink Stubhub  and upgrade our tickets, getting fifth row center for not much more than we had already paid.  Karen's boyfriend Mike and his friend bought the other tickets from us.  311 is always a fun concert and tonight was no exception.  The opener we saw were The Roots and they were really good.  Of course when the show started the fans that were a little bit back from the front section tried to come up.  There was some room where we were, so fine, whatever.  This one guy though got on the seat where a girl was standing and was kind of grinding against her.  She wasn't liking that too much and asked him to move.  He was clearly not someone who had a seat in our section (otherwise he would have probably been sitting there) and he was also under the influence of something, either beer or otherwise.  He came over behind Karen and I and stood on our chairs.  He started grinding around.  We asked him to move (because we didn't have any room and he wasn't helping) and he said something like, "That girl over there (points at the girl next to Karen that just told him to move).. she's a total b----.  She's not cool.  I won't be in your way, I'll just stand back here."  (Grind, grind)  There was a couple in front of us that we met during the break between bands and they were super cool.  The gentleman was muscular and built like you wouldn't want to mess with him.  He was watching this dork out of the corner of his eye...  Karen and I asked him to move again and he was not listening to us.  The person in front of us (I wish I knew his name) said, "Can you just go somewhere else and leave the girls alone?"  Captain Jackass launched into his rant about how that other girl was a (well you know) and after a minute of back and forth, he pushed the nice guy in front of us.  Nice guy pushed back, and being much stronger than the punk kid, pushed him so hard that the punk fell backwards and on his back on the ground in the row behind us.    The punk gets up again and starts pushing on Mr. Nice Guy (remember, Karen and I are in between them now).  Mr. Nice Guy knocks him over again.  He gets up (now people in the crowd are starting to watch) and this time, grazes Karen and I with blows on his way to try to hit the guy in front of us.  I got hit pretty good in the right eye and my contact was on the verge of popping out.  No one messes with me and my sister, and especially when our favorite band is on stage.  I turned around and hit him.  I punched him like 3 times, then I pushed him (although he didn't fall like when the nice, strong guy pushed him).  Other people around us started restraining the jackass.  He manages to swing again and hit Karen in the face (not super hard, but hard enough to give her a fat lip).  Now I was really mad but I just let the guys handle it and pulled Karen aside.  Nick Hexum, the lead singer of 311, stopped what they were doing (they had just finished a song) and goes, "Dude, that's not cool" to the jackass kid.  Security came sweeping in and took him away.  I don't know how much of the fight was on the overhead screens at The Knob but I know some of it was.. I wonder how many people saw me hit this guy.  I haven't been in a fight since I was 12, and I hate violence, but man, don't beat up on people at the concert because you're mad that you don't have better seats.  Especially two girls.  Dummy.  Props to 311 for drawing attention to him (otherwise I don't know if security would have seen it), and all the guys around us for helping out a couple girls that ended up in the middle of a fight.  311 is the best band in the world and the fans are super too.  I feel bad for Mr. Nice Guy's lady friend who lost a watch somehow in the scuffle.  If I have a black eye in the morning I'll be sure to post some pics.  I find it strange that the fighting started during "1, 2, 3" which is one of the chillest, most mellow 311 songs there is.  Sample lyrics:  ...run up the hill do as you do I'm going to chill you know you really ought to do the same...   Other than the fight the concert was incredible.  I saw about 4 people go running across the stage only to be tackled by more security.  The crowd was so loud.  The setlist was great.. and they even played Omaha Stylee for one of the encore songs which is unheard of.  (After they took a poll and let the crowd pick one of two songs.)

      As most of my readers (I think there are two now) know, this is my first summer here in Texas.  After 21 summers in the Detroit area and 5 in Northern Michigan, this has been quite the change :).  In June it rained every day for about 3 weeks straight and there was flooding here.  They had to even close Six Flags for a day or two because part of it was under water.  After that, it didn't rain for about a month!  Last week, some parts of the DFW area got a foot of rain in one day and it flooded again.  Very, very strange weather.  Now it's hot again, pushing 100 degrees for the last few days with no break in sight.  Oh well, I guess I can miss Michigan for a couple months out of the year and still come out ahead :).
