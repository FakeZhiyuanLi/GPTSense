      I just wanted to thank the King, Tom, for passing off his horrible "I don't want to do anything" syndrome to me!  Last night was fun but it was uneventful.  So now I don't feel like doing anything!  Grrr...if you find a cure let me know.

      Anybody feel like doing anything tonight?  A movie, the Levee, Gameworks, Poker - which I learned how to play well last night against my dad, anything?  If so, holler!   Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.   Hebrews 13:2

      So, I wake up at 10, decent amount of sleep (7 hours), eat some breakfast, run, do a little cardio, shower, screw around on the internet, eat lunch, screw around some more on the internet, clean a bathroom and my room, and wallow in boredom.  Man, I love summer.

      Do you feel love or a lack thereof?  Love is a bond without reason, a cry for connection, a light in your eyes. Love is a reason for living, a reason for trying, a reason for life.  Forget the feeling.  Forget all your reasons. Life is love or the lack thereof.  Love is a bond without reason, a cry for connection, a light in your eyes. Love is a reason for living, a reason for trying, a reason for life.  Love is everything.    Oh love, you move me. Love move in me. Love, move me. Love is everything.   Have you found a reason for you To change who you used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is...between you and God.  Nothing can change the way you feel.  You can't tell your heart what to do and what not to do.  You can't tell your heart not to hurt, because then it would never love.  Love hurts.  But life goes on.  Have a little faith in love.  Your hearts can handle more than you think.  And not every love hurts - like friendships.  They are the purest love you will ever find.  Embrace it.  Maybe all that true love will balance out the painful love.  Have a little faith boys.  Cyanide kisses happen to even the best of us.

      I will win this battle against my parents.  More so my dad, but whatever.  I am 18, I'm responsible, I'm an adult.  I should be able to do whatever I want to do.  So from now on, I'm just going to do it.  I don't care what it takes.  I want my life back.  I want to be able to see my friends whenever I want.  I understand that a curfew is still in order, and that is fine by me.  But I am setting my own rules now.

      Ok, I am totally with the Fresh Prince (and DJ Jazzy Jeff) on this one...parents just don't understand.  I am so tempted to just leave my house and live out of my car right now.  I've got to get out of this prison that has become my home!  I must admit, recently, I did win a small battle in that I am going to Louisville, but seriously, what is so wrong about wanting to have a social life?  Everybody's doing it Dad.    Dad, he's driving me crazy...I just want to ERR! punch something.  I'm really trying not to cuss here but it is quite difficult.  Last night we fought for 3 hours about me going to Louisville and this morning we fought for an hour about a map.  Not kidding.  A fuckin' map!  He said that the baseball fields were directly lined up with Nunn Hall at NKU's campus or some shit.  I said they weren't, and in my defense, which I technically don't need to defend anything because I was right, I think I know NKU's campus just a little better than him.  He went off for 30 minutes about how he was right because he's never wrong...I don't know, I wasn't listening because I knew I was right.  I lived there all summer, dammit, I would know.  All he had to do was pick my sister up from a volleyball camp.  That was it.  It was the first time he's had to pick a kid up since I've had my license and he bitches at me about directions and the inaccuricies of a rough sketch of a map that I drew?  Let's grow up just a little bit, ok?  More to come...

      Today was a sad day.  First thing I heard when I woke up was that my baby cousin, just born on Wednesday, died this morning.  She wasn't breathing.  Her heart had stopped.  One day old.  She only made it one day in the world.  It made me think.  How was that supposed to fit into God's plan?  I still have faith in him, but it just seems so cruel.  My aunt is beside herself, and her four children too.  Not to mention my uncle.  They had already brought the baby home.  Everything was fine.  Audrey was fine.  Why did she have to die?  I didn't even get to see her.    But she has to be in a better place right?  In the arms of God, eternally happy and warm and safe.  She has to be.  She was so innocent.  Born without sin.  She didn't have enough time to do wrong anyway.    I don't know what this means, or how it changes things, but it does.  Now Audrey is part of the past, a little bit of history that gives June 30 a whole new meaning.  She is safe now.  She's just waiting for us, with God.  I just hope His little plan works.  I still have faith.  I just hope that the grieving do too.

      Life... well... I think it is pretty great right now.  I've done some of the most unthinkable things in the past couple of weeks.  I've become the youngest manager in our stores history, I've had the best sales week in history for my particular store, but most of all I've achieved an unbelievable mental goal.  It feels awesome!  I have never felt so happy with myself, and I have learned to love life even more than I have in the past.  Now it's my turn to be happy again, I am finally out of this damn soap operaesque, high school, drama, that once just made me want to beat myself with a rock it was so... childishly stupid and I don't even know why I kept getting pulled back into it while I was trying to get out.  Thank God, I believe the nightmare is finally over and I can sleep peacefully now.   I've also come to the conclusion that I am out of shape... which i   planto take care of here shortly once i finally get my chiropractor appointment.  Once I start kicking my body's ass I think life will only continue to stay fun.

      I know it has been a couple days since i have posted on the site, but i have been busy working till nine then coming home and sleeping the past couple days.  So here's a little up date while i have some spare time at work.  NOTHING INTERESTING HAS HAPPENED.  So you haven't missed out on much.  But today is kicking assI've been working for four and a half hours and as of right now I'm making $23.33 an hour, and even if i don't sell another phone the rest of the day I'll make an average of $17.50 an hour.  IT TRUELY IS GOOD TO BE THE KING.  Plus I've made more in the past 4 days than I do in a month normally.

      All I can say is, "It feels so fucking good to make $13.00 an hour, all I had to do was sell three phones and man I have it made.  I've realized that if i can keep this up I'll up my pay from around $500 a month to at least $1500!  It truely is good to be the king.  It still could suck if i go up there and work 8 hours and have no one buy a phone because then i'll have not only spent 8 hours doing work/ waiting for people to come to the booth... but I won't get paid!  It's a risk but it is finally nice to be in charge of something, I finally feel that my boss has recognized my talent and is putting it to good use, not just wasting me in Downtown (not saying downtown is a bad place, but to many people fail credit checks and it's slow makes you just want to sit there)  But it has been a great past couple days, the other day I was given $16 off of my purchase b/c I bought four items... fuckin awesome.  Incubus, Goldfinger, and Catch 22.  I love life right now, ahhh I don't know why I'm in such a good mood but I just want to go somewhere and party.

      Welcome to my new Standard Lines site.  This site is going to be my main focus from here on out, I may occasionally update the old Blog, but only with something serious arrises. Who knows... but anyways, I'm going to try and make this one look a bit nicer than some of my other ones, with a little help from html.  We'll see how bad this turns out and if so i'll just prolly have to re-do the whole thing.  Wish me luck on this epic adventure.

      I havent really posted on here in awhile but I have't really had any time to post anything because I'm working on average at least 45 hours a week (YAY) and not to mention the fact nothing really exciting has happened in my life.&nbsp; Until friday.&nbsp; Friday was the day that made me just want to hate everything because I hurt my pride and joy that day.&nbsp; I backed in to a light pole, but the shitter is... it was the most idiotic place for a light pole i have ever seen.&nbsp; It was in the middle of the fuckin lane.&nbsp; It makes me so mad still just to even think about it because my truck no longer looks pretty =( it's got a big chunk in it's ass dented in.&nbsp; That day sucked but luckily my birthday on the 17th was better.&nbsp; I got my laptop that i have been wanting to get for the past month or so and I got me a best buy credit card which i guess is sort of cool.&nbsp; Then today on monday I got to open my OWN checking account (KEWL)&nbsp; but yeah, not much exciting stuff happening in my life so i'll get back to my boring life and catch up with you all later

      Again, yet another soap opera tries to begin, but I'm goin to stop it before it gets out of hand and people start judging and questioning stupid things.  I was drunk last night yeah... did I say anything that i shouldn't have said? No, I believe everything that was said last night was said for a reason... We wouldn't ave to worryu about stupid shit like this if people would just answer a question... but I guess it's not that simple.  Now everything I said last night I meant and people are just going to have to fucking get over it because the truth hurts.  Yeah no one knows what you're goign thru... big deal. no one knows what I'm goign thru or what other people are  going thru but we don't pop pills, or try and physically harm ourselves because that is just stupid.  I'm sorry but taking the easiest possible way out is for those with little self worth.  So let's not fuckin get into this shit again because I don't feel like dealing with it.  we all need to grow a fucking set, quit being selfish, and quit pitying ourselves.  But most of all grow up.    There the show's over, post what you want my decision that people need to grow up is final.

      Hello again everyone, it's been I believe at least a week since i have posted on the site so i better bring you up to date with what has been going on in my life.  Well there really hasn't been anything exciting in my as of yet, I'm still a single guy just living and having fun.  But you know it would be nice to have a girl, I've been working on it somewhat but not really because i'm still unsure of what exactly i want.  Oh well, once school starts up at NKU i'm sure that i'll meet someone who i can connect with really well.  I can't wait to start college it's going to be awesome.    Today I worked an 11-hour day when i was only suppossed to work for 5 so that pissed me off a little bit, but when you're manager that happens.  Other shitty thing is, I didn't get paid jack shit because I didn't sell a damn thing today... I've never seen a mall so dead before.  But it's cool I'm finally gettign to move closer to home when I go to florence.  Well I don't really have anythign to say so I'm going to just head out and chill out until I don't know when.
