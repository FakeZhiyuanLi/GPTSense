      The Forillion Blogspot will also include updates that are more recent, along with the history in pictures that has already started.  Although the majority of winter has passed us by, we are still experiencing quite a chill-in-the-air as we head into August.  The weekend passed with little happening out, as the temperature dropped and intermittant showers left everyone either indoors or out and about elsewhere. The usual noise of the street's kids riding bikes or kicking a ball was amiss.  It was good to see Paul and Sandra back on Australian soil following their sojourn home to England, Scotland and Ireland. The thought of the trip alone left many in the street envious, and it wasn't until we discovered that Steve and Maureen were off to Canada did I certainly realise, there is a lot more to living here than rates bills and water bills.  But with winter comes some much needed rain. And pleased to say that very few of us in the valley have felt the need to water lawns and gardens. And yet this end of the street does look nice and green, the lusciousness of pre-spring growth is certainly making a difference.  It is only a pity that the lads couldn't get the render on the side wall of 54. Maybe next weekend. Not that we are in any kind of hurry, knowing that the paint alone is going to burn a small hole in the pocket.  But preparations for the forthcoming dinner party are enough of a distraction to make it through the coolness of the damp weekends. It will certainly be an evening to remember...  Until next time...

      In March 2002 we finally staked our claim. Although we had looked far and away (including some rediculous possibilities) it wasn't until one weekend we stumbled across a land-sale sign posted on the side of Stock Road.  Curious, as I was, and since neither of us knew of this land-sale, we diverted our trip to take a look.  To our surprise, we found a pocket of newly released blocks of land. Not-to-large, not-to-small. We drove about the small estate looking at the various plots and found something we could actually picture as being ours.  We left the new estate and spent some time thinking, and researching the idea of staking our claim, on what was to become Forillion Avenue.

       Welcome to Forillion Avenue   This blog is all about the various happenings, people, events that surround my local neighbourhood.

        urlLink     Peter Receives one of the best-dressed awards for his Moutaineers outfit    The dinner party, although not requiring it, was an opportunity for the guests to dress up in character, and here we see Peter receive an award for his "Rog" the mountaineer outfit. Left is Olivia as 'Randy', next to 'Rog' is Michael as 'Pro' and on the right is Greg as good old 'Dr Mal'  Thanks everyone the night was a great success and the company was good fun.
