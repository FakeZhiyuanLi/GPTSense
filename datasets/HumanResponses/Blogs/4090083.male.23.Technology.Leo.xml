      It's 3:58 am. I ain't got work today but why the hell am I awake? I chatted with this girl named "Ruth" in one mirc channel while I was waiting for the download of the final episode of  Friends  and an animated  Spiderman  episode to end. Did you say Ruth? Wow is this coincidence or what? It just so happened that I've never been in a relationship in my life except for this girl, also named Ruth. It lasted for 3, no 4, no 5, no 6 months, hell, I don't know. Maybe she's the only one who could answer that. I can't really tell if it was even a relationship. I also met her in a chatroom. I started calling her for a few days. She told me that she just broke up with someone but at the same time she seemed to be over it and it seems that she was just waiting for me to ask her. So then it happened. Here I am, just wanting to know what it's like to have a girlfriend. I asked her to be my girl and we ended up saying "love u" over the phone w/o probably meaning it. We were already a couple w/o having met each other. We went out and watched a movie w/ two of her friends. Yes, I definitely remember what the movie was, it was  Spiderman . I called her up for about 2 more nights after that. She then told me that I wouldn't be able to call her anymore since her dad gets mad when a guy calls her. Thank God they invented cellphones. We still had time to talk, I mean text each other. The "love u's" were still there but it became shorter (luv u). We went out one more time w/ her friends again and all we did was eat for about an hour. We still texted &amp; sometimes called each other after that and as far as I know we were still a couple. 4 or 5 months have passed. I was still texting and calling her up but the replys were far and between. It came to a point wherein we won't hear from each other. I was calling her but I never heard a word. 2 weeks after, she texted me and she told me that she was sorry. Sorry for what? She said it wasn't me and the problem was hers. She met another guy. Suddenly everything became black, what was that? Were those tears that just fell from my eyes?? Why am I crying? Was it because I loved her or was it the thought of being left for another man w/o knowing it. We could have talked but she'd rather not. Blame it on me. Love is not a game that can be played.. I have learned my lesson well..
