      Can I  please  make it through 10 minutes of an NBA-related broadcast without hearing the word "chippy?" It's starting to reach "there is no there there" and "sooner rather than later" proportions.

      So, three of four gunmen within a surrounded compound manage to escape. Was it Saudi security incompetence, or is anybody else suspicious that more was at play here?  The father of an Egyptian boy killed in the attack said, "What is his guilt? That's not only my child, this is an innocent child going to school,"  said. "What is this? Terrorism? Islam? What is it? Those are not Muslims." Meanwhile, an audiotape from the group behind the attack said that they will continue attacking Westerners until all had left the "Arab peninsula."  The most recent toll that I've seen said that among the dead were an Egyptian boy, three Saudis, one American, one Italian, eight Indians, three Filipinos, two Sri Lankans, one Swede, one South African and one Briton. But surely it's the fault of the USA and Israel, right?

      Some people were wondering why I didn't ask which  company  had the worst E3, instead of  which platform. Okay...  Now, if my main concern is console gaming, what do I care about how companies did with their handhelds? And vice versa. If I'm a GameCube junkie (or "sheep" as they like to be called), I want to know what the bright sports were for the Cube, not the frickin' GBA.  In fact, with regard to console gaming, all that handhelds have succeeded in doing so far, are to  detract  from the enjoyment of console games. Any Cubers who were looking forward to multiplayer games over the internet &mdash; and are you gonna tell me that Mario Kart online wouldn't have been sweet? &mdash; can look at the GBA and Nintendo's push for GBA connectivity as the reason why it ain't happenin' for you. (Yeah, I know about Phantasy Star Online, where you've got to pay a monthly fee, and I'm also aware of the half-assedness of Warp Pipe.)  Then you have Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. Inarguably made worse by Nintendo trying to cram GBA connectivity down people's throats. Problem is, a lot of people just want to play their console games, not be practically forced into buying extra GBAs just to make it remotely fun &mdash; one Japanese publication even gave the single player aspects  a negative score !  Now you see why I separate these things out?

      Going to try using the new Blogger for a while. If things work okay, I might transfer the rest of my joint over here. So...  Um, yeah.

      Well, the Canadians just finished tallying their votes a minute before I write this, and what a defeat it turned out to be for Martin.  Months ago his Liberal Party was expected to easily garner the 155 electoral districts needed for majority rule. Well as the results of the last undecided district rolled in, it went to the Conservatives, meaning that the Liberals and New Democrats  combined  didn't even reach 155. Ouch.  Totals:   LIB: 135 CON: &nbsp;99 BQ : &nbsp;54 NDP: &nbsp;19 N-A: &nbsp;&nbsp;1

      Seems like there's only one who happens to make 95% of the articles when they're looking for a comment about President Bush. And whaddaya know, it just happens to be the liberal one who didn't even agree with his old man in the first place. Nevermind that one has a radio show and can be heard advocating for the President just about every day, that ain't news!

      Many in the media have been telling us how wrong and downright deceitful the president and vice president have been this week for stating that there were connections between Iraq and al qaeda. Lee Hamilton weighed in this morning on the media's shameful performance: "I must say I have trouble understanding the flap over this. The vice president is saying, I think, that there were connections between al qaeda and Saddam Hussein's government. We  don't  disagree with that. So it seems to me the sharp differences that the press has drawn, the media has drawn, are not that apparent to me."  Time for some retractions...

      Love Firefox. Loved it when it was still Firebird. It's been my default browser since around version 0.5 or so. Like Thunderbird, I even keep an eye on new nightly builds for new features or fixes that interest me. But now, about a month before they're supposed to release a version 1.0 milestone, the leadership has up and decided to get rid of the outstanding, very Windows XP-ish look that it had, and replace it with this rubbish called Winstripe. Since most Firefox users are used to Windows, it's really unclear why they've decided to shove this Mac look down everybody's throat. Bottom line, it stinks.  I don't want to be too harsh on the Winstripe creators &mdash; I know a lot of Mac users like the look. But when Firefox is a month away from going prime time, and users are stuck with a look that's more like amateur hour targetted at a platform that most people  don't  use, it's frigging ridiculous. And yeah, being Firefox, of course you can change the theme, but as a first impression to present to a newbie, this is horrific.     The Qute theme, which had been working fine:         The new Winstripe theme, suddenly introduced just a month or two before Firefox 1.0 should be out:

      Man, I really hate to slag off the fantastic work that Ben Goodger and Scott MacGregor have accomplished with their respective Mozilla projects, Firefox and Thunderbird, but what I've seen lately is disheartening.  One or two milestone versions ago (either 0.4 or 0.5, I forget), and I was using Thunderbird for email about as often as I was using Outlook 2003. Then they came out with a new milestone that rejiggered their spam filter &mdash; and by "rejiggering," I mean made it stop working well. The old spam catcher was actually my favorite part of the program, because it did it so damn well! It caught the vast majority of my spam, with hardly ever a false positive. Now, since said rejiggering, despite following every release note instruction to a T, despite probably more than 10,000 emails having passed through its Inbox since the "upgrade," it hardly catches jack shit. And worse, I get some false positives, meaning I have to waste a ton of time double-checking my spam folder which I had gotten used to not needing to do with the old Thunderbird.  Ahh well, it seems I've lost patience with the program. I still collect my email with it, alongside Outlook 2003, but I pretty much don't even touch it anymore. And as the Inbox fills with hundreds and hundreds of spams, my inertia increases because I know if I start using it again I'll need to go through and clean all that crap out. Ugh...

         Well, Ronald Wilson Reagan passed away today. Arguably the greatest American president since Lincoln (and only FDR is eligible for this debate), not just for starting the fall of the Soviet empire, but for the way he lifted Americans up and made them proud of themselves and their country again, as well as bringing conservative and libertarian principles to the mainstream. May God bless the Gipper and his spirit.

      So when the unsurprising news that 75 percent of the terrorists involved in the recent attach made the news, an unnamed Saudi official claimed that it was okay, because the hostages were the first priority &mdash; coulda fooled me, going by the death toll &mdash; and that they knew where the others were and could get them whenever they wanted.  Well, nearly a week later, and we're still waiting...  I actually have no doubt that they know where they are. I just have every doubt in the world that they plan to go after them. This is one kingdom I won't be shedding any tears over when it crumbles.

      So, a national security advisor to the Clinton administration, who happens to be a foreign policy advisor to John Kerry, stuffs classified documents and notes about them into his jacket and down his pants and leaves the National Archives with them. Oh yeah, and can't produce all of them when confronted by the FBI. ( urlLink Link to AP story )    Good luck knowing about this if you read Tuesday's  NY Times . Somehow  urlLink their article  about the matter, authored by Mark Glassman, neglects to mention his association with Kerry, his attempt to conceal his removal of the documents -- why else would he have placed them in his clothing instead of with the rest of the documents he was carrying -- or, by his own admission, the fact that all the documents were returned. In fact, rather than omit the matter entirely, Glassman uses Sandy Berger's lawyer's comments to spin an impression that all the documents were indeed returned:   Mr. Berger returned all of the documents and notes to the archives in October, within a week of his learning they were missing, his lawyers said. Odd...Sandy Berger himself doesn't even make that claim. From the AP account by John Solomon:    "When I was informed by the Archives that there were documents missing, I immediately returned everything I had except for a few documents that I apparently had accidently discarded," he said.   Whew, sure glad he's on the ball when it comes to national security!    So, is this a new low for the  NY Times , or just par for the course?

         No, it's not a picture of Vietnam vets letting Senator Kerry know what they thought of his anti-war activity.  Gotta wonder what posesses Reuters to take a pic like that, let alone publish it. Good luck convincing me that the photographer, Allen Fredrickson, didn't set that shot up that way on purpose.
