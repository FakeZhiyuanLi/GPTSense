      What a long day it has been already.  The mini-van just got out of the shop and the transmission light is already back on, figures.  I guess it is better for it break down before we go on vacation.  The pool is cloudy today the dog needs a bath.  Seems like Satan does what he can to keep our minds so occupied with stress that we forget to pray or spend any time with God.  I have decided not to worry about the van or the cloudy pool.  (I think the pool is the least of my problems.)  I am just going to sit and watch God deal with the problem He certainly was not surprised when that light came on so why should I be?  We are trying to make some changes at church and move our church into, at least, the last century.  I have heard it said that our society is modern and technological but when you walk into the doors of most churches they are 100 years behind the times.  I think that is so true.  A lost world is not interested in our beautiful stain glass windows or the color of our pews, they are looking for soul food and we have it.  How in the world are we going to get them into the door if they don't recognize the place when they walk in?  We have become a technological society why should the church be any different?  Does that mean we change the message of the Bible?  Heaven forbid; but can the church be flexible and change with the culture in which they function?  Absolutely!!!  I wish that our church would be more concerned with what is outside our doors than what is inside them.  Well, I guess we will pray for them and for our community, with God nothing is impossible not fixing the van or stretching our church.

      Wow, what a crazy idea, write your thoughts on the web for the whole world to read.  Not that the whole world is interested in what a housewife living in S. Illinois has on her mind but nevertheless here I am.  I am not sure what to say so I will start with what is on my mind which turns out to be very little.  This has been an uneventful day.  Our family just returned from a week in N. Carolina, much prettier than S. Illinois, by the way.  We had a great week and it was nice to be in the mountains with just my husband and three kids.  No pressures, no phone, no cartoon network.  My husband serves as a minister of a church here and although it was nice to get away I am glad it is still nice to come home and see our friends at church.  Our church is nice, mostly.  It seems we can never please everyone but in general it is a kind church.  We were very surprised and overwhelmed to discover that repairs on our minivan had been taken care of by some of the church members while we were away.  At times like that I think we could stay here forever, then to go to church the next day and have someone hurt your feelings you change your mind and wonder when and if God is going to move you.  Not that I want to move but at times it seems like a good idea.
