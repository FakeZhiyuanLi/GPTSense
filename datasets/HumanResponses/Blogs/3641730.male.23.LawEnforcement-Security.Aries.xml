      The last few days at work have been interesting, to say the least. I was embroiled in a VIP transportation scandal of immense proportions. The normal morningtime bellman called out of his shift because he had swollen feet. The normal bellman is kind of an asshat. I actually went to the trouble of learning his name, a courtesy that he has yet to extend to me. He simply refers to me as, "man". So, he called out and the the embroligo began.  The front officer manager was notified as soon as the "swollen-footed one" made his impending absence known. Being the "ready to serve" employee that I am, Manager Man asks me to do a favor for him. I'm pretty certain that the front office manager doesn't know who I am either. This didn't stop him from talking to me like we've known each other for years. I suppose that this was a way to build trust and create a strong relationship in this time of uncertaintity and chaos. Actually, he was trying to save his own rep and pawn the responsibility of an abondoned job onto me. So, with reluctance and a heavy heart, I accepted the mission that would prove to be one of the most trying situations of my short life.   The mission at hand was as follows. I was to transport the members of a certain boy band, who at one time were chart-toppingly popular, to a charity golf tournament. I began the mission by parking the hotel van at the front entrance of the hotel. Then, trying to be as professional as I am capable of being, opened the van doors awaiting their entry. After opening the van doors I stood at the side of the van with my hands clasped behind my back in direct mimicry of cinema and television chauffers. I think that I probably looked like an idiot. While awaiting the 90's pop music royalty to make their exit from the hotel I began to panic. I had forgotten whether I was supposed to wait at the side door to avoid "fans", or whether I was fine where I was at. I made a panicked trip to the front desk to get my temporarily forgotten instructions. Turns out I was cool and the most harm that I received was condescending looks from the front desk personnel.   Finally, the boy band's manager arrived and turned a glance at me that said, "Ahhh, working class, how quaint." I showed him who the boss was by saying, "Is there anything that I can carry for you, sir." A few moments after our unspoken class war happened one of the members of the royal family arrived downstairs and lit up a Marlboro. I have to admit, I was impressed. I like to see a certain amount of vice in people. This admiration was soon dissipated when he told me to put his golf bag in the van. One after another the royal family of late 90's boy band pop slowly made their way to the hotel van and put themselves into my care.   After making sure all members were present I began the short drive to the golf course. During this entire affair no one spoke to me. I was simply the "hired help" and a necessary intrusion into their world of celebrity. We arrived at the golf course after an approxmately 10 minute drive. There were no rabid fans or paparazzi awaiting the pop powerhouse at the golf course. This simple fact gave me an immense satisfaction that I thought could only be acheived by seeing George W. Bush explode. After I had opened the door had and gotten their bags I waited for the huge tip that I was surely going to receive. Then it happened. NO DAMN TIP! I thought that SURELY there was some mistake. These fellows are millionaires, surely they can throw a 20 spot my way. No, obviously they couldn't. I guess they had fallen on harder times than I had originally thought. The worst part of the ordeal was that I didn't even get a "thank you" from these guys. At least throw some decency my way. I know that I'm not super-cute and I don't have a velvet vocal box, but I DID work overtime to get them to the tournament on time.   In retrospect, I would not have chosen to accept this mission.

      I have a confession to make. I am Jim Steinman’s biggest fan. Terrible, isn’t it? You’d think that I would have more respect for the music community  than that, wouldn’t you?   Well, I don’t.   For those of you that don’t know who Jim Steinman is, he is the mastermind behind the most excellent 1977 Meat Loaf album “Bat out of Hell”. Also, he wrote music for Bonnie Tyler and Meat Loaf’s other big album “Bat out of Hell II”.   I know that I shouldn’t like this music. It is trite, over the top, and way too 70’s. But, for some reason I just can’t stop listening. I try to tell myself that I have other, more refined, musical tastes; but all I wanna do is listen to the Stein-Man.   If there is someone that has an antidote for this terrible affliction, please, send some my way.  The Reasons I Love Steinman:  1.	Operatic Rock ‘n Roll awsomeness! It’s Wagnerian!  2.	“Bat Out of Hell” was started as a rock opera about Peter Pan.    3.	What’s wrong with Bonnie Tyler’s voice?   4.	On “Bat out of Hell II:Back into Hell” Jim Steinman does this voice part and mentions how his guitar sounds like a horny angel.  5.	Mrs. Loud  6.	He always wears gloves. Really weird gloves.  7.	The Stein-Man is going bald, but keeps his hair really long.  8.	He writes music for a guy that named himself Meat Loaf.  9.	He is the most dirty-minded music writer in the business (sans Rap/Hip-Hop artists).

      Often times my fiancée, Amanda, talks to me about how depressed and underwhelmed she is with the life that she is leading. I usually just try to smile and honestly hope that something will pull her out of this episodic melancholy. Normally, I try to reassure her that life is nothing but a series of choices which interconnect with circumstance. Sometimes this approach works and sometimes she cries all night long.   Amanda writes the most beautiful poetry and stories that eyes can read. Lately, even this avenue of expression has been taken from her via bipolar disorder. The days when she does feel decent and extroverted, I secretly ask myself if this isn’t just her putting on a show in order to keep our relationship and herself from falling part.  Being bound up and tied by an invisible assailant must be the most terrible of all feelings. The immense fear of not knowing where to direct anger and sorrow are, presumably, debilitating. There are some days when I honestly fear for her life and her ability to keep everything together. Other days I simply wish for her to feel the honesty of true happiness and fulfillment. Her absolute desire to live a passionate and extraordinary life should not be so easily discarded.

      As the two-hundred and twenty-eighth birthday of our once great Republic draws close there are many causes for concern as to the direction that the United States of America is heading. The current administration has shamed the very principles that made the United States a shining beacon of hope and possibility to the rest of the world. As easy as it would be to blame George W. Bush and the rest of his administration for the current state of disapproval, both foreign and domestic, that exist toward the nation currently, the fall of this Republic has been coming for nigh on fifty years.   In retrospect, the turn of the United States from glorious and benevolent Republic to dominating and aggressive Empire is the only logical conclusion to a post-World War II planet. The choices laid before the United States after World War II were not very conducive to the pre-war isolation that previous administrations enjoyed. The large military and civilian presence of United States citizens in Europe automatically changed the way that European nations were forced to operate. The Marshall Plan created an environment of dependence for most of Western Europe. No longer could the contributions of American industry and commerce be kept at bay, for the entire industrial complex of Western Europe had been destroyed during the war. The reliance on American economic and military protection from the growing Soviet power planted the seeds of hatred and jealousy, that would later grow into the anti-American sentiment that the world currently expresses.  During the Cold War, European nations were regaining a foothold on their own economic agendas and building their own protective organizations against the Soviet Empire. The United States was becoming less and less necessary for European security. The power that the United States tasted as being the European ruler by proxy intoxicated the power hungry in Washington and the corporate aristocracy that was backing them. For a decade the entire Western European market had been open to American marketing and goods. The whole of Western Europe was indeed entranced by the economic might of the American economy. The best way to keep goods flowing into this recovering market was to increase the "necessity" of the American military presence in Europe. The most innocuous means of keeping Europe tied to the U.S. was via the foreign policy of Communist Containment. The United States had cause for strong military presence in Europe, so, most domestic European nations reduced the sizes of their militaries and the United States became the de facto protector of Europe for as long as anyone could foresee. In thirty years time the legitimacy of the U.S. military presence in Europe would be called into question by those that had been under it's umbrella of "protection".  "The sun never sets on the British Empire", is a source of both shame and pride for the British Empire. Where Great Britain controlled entire nations all over the globe, the United States has placed military installations in innumerable countries. Is there honestly a difference when it comes to Empire? The United States has expanded it's military industrial complex all over the face of the earth. Who would dare oppose an enemy that sits on the doorstep? The message the United States projects is not that of protector, or even "policeman for the world". The message being displayed is that of conqueror and oppressor. The United States is trying to shape the world in it's own image, and some nations would prefer to shape themselves after their own culture and heritage. Is it the United States job to convert the world to our way of thinking? Should reasonable objection from the international community be outright rejected? President Bush and the military industrial complex surely do, and you'd better agree too because the American Military is knocking on the front door.

      So, I'm into politics and international affairs, right. That being said, I think that it's about time for some revolution. Not some pacifist's wet dream kind of revolution, either. I'm talking about guns, knives, and sticking a bayonnet in some fucker's belly kind of revolution. Like World War II, except instead of fighting Nazis we'll kill Republicans, Democrats and Ralph Nader.   Speaking of Ralph Nader, what a complete douche. I mean, does he get pleasure from fucking up presidential elecions? I completely agree that the Republicans and Democrats are mostly just different sides of the same coin, but still. Who would want some ignorant fundamental Christian motherfucker giving them the biznazz about their business? Not me, so stop fucking everything up!  On to the fundamental christian neocons. Fuck them! I guess that all of the new faith-based initiatives and political whoring going on in churches is what the Founding Fathers really wanted. The only problem is that the Founding Fathers took the exact opposite position.   "I contemplate with solemn reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a wall of separation between Church and State." - TJ  I guess that the opinion of someone who was intimately involved with the Bill of Rights doesn't mean anything(I know T.J. was in Paris at the time of framing, but his correspondence and input was still heavily influential in the Constitution and Bill of Rights). It just blows my goddamned mind that the current administration refuses to acknowledge the principles of government that the Republic is supposed to abide.   Honestly, I wish that someone would go and beat all of the Senators, Representatives, and the entire Executive Branch with lead pipes. Every time the President, et al. open their cocksuckers they disrespect the Republic. BAH!   Go  urlLink here

      This is abso-fucking-lutely horrible. I kind of want to write about what I "do" for a living, but I don't think that anyone really wants know. Well, you know what? Fuck you, this is all that I've got in my boring little life.  OK, check this out. I have the easiest job on the planet earth. I limit myself to earth because some fucking alien lifeform twenty-five billion lightyears away that mankind doesn't know about may have an easier job than me. I just want to cover my bases and not ruin mankind's chance for inter-stellar peace because I insulted some alien janitor.  Alright, back to the biographical bullshit. I work at a Marriott Hotel. Man, this place is super-swanky, all right. My official job title is "Loss Prevention Officer, 3rd Shift". What that really means is that I'm the "3rd Shift Solitaire Playin' Guy". I mean, yeah, I have to walk around and make sure no one steals shit, or that no one has decided to fuck up someone else's face with a shotty, but I mostly just play Solitaire.   The best part of my job is this Mexican dude, Raymundo. He doesn't speak the English so well and his favorite thing in the world is to call everybody, "gay". He gave me the nickname "Toro", I guess he did this because I'm a big dude and he knows that if he called  me something like "assclown" I would beat his ass with my fists of fury. The funny thing is that the dudes that work night audit have stupid names like "Burro" and "Buck". Why he named us after animals I will never know.  There are four other people that work in my department. These individuals vary astonishly in their personalities and lifestyle choices. My manager is really fat and lazy. I'm not sure why he doesn't get fired, but if I were the boss, his "i'm gonna leave work early everyday and go fishing" ass would be grass. My supervisor is this older guy from Louisiana. He's pretty cool, I guess. I don't wanna rag on him too much. He pretty much does his job. Now to my fellow officers in the Hotel P.D. The only female in my "unit" is a lesbian. She's a pretty atypical lesbian, I guess. She doesn't talk about it very much and dresses all "punk rock". The "punk rock" factor makes me chuckle a little bit, actually. I looked through her CD collection one day at work and noticed an overwhelming number of discs by "pop" artists such as Mandy Moore and Jessica Simpson. Maybe she likes the music or maybe she thinks they're hot. Who knows? The final component to my little cadre of security officers is this really country dude. He talks like he just stepped out of "The Dukes of Hazzard". He's kinda funny, but I don't really have anything in common with him(he's 20, has a kid and is on his second marriage), so we generally don't talk.   Enough of that! Next post I promise to tell you about my bi-polar fiancée.

      So, I decided to start a blog. I guess that writing in a blog is the "hip" thing to do at the moment. A forum to house your thoughts and ramblings is a good idea, and I surely didn't want to end up posting my ideas on a site like LiveJournal(I think that having a LiveJournal automatically makes you either emo or a chick, maybe both). Soooo, be prepared to read a bunch of stupid shit that is probably better written somewhere else.

      Cheesy, nude Monn arrested Tuesday, July 20, 2004 Posted: 12:43 PM EDT (1643 GMT)        MARYVILLE, Tennessee (AP) -- Michael P. Monn's birthday celebration went a little awry when he was arrested while drunk, nude and covered with nacho cheese.  Monn was detained early Sunday as he ran toward a Jeep in the parking lot outside a swimming pool snack bar.   According to police, he was stark naked and was carrying a box of Frito Lay snacks and a container of nacho cheese.  "The male had nacho cheese in his hair, on his face and on his shoulders," Maryville Police Department officer Scott Spicer said.   "The nude male had a strong odor of alcohol and was semi-incoherent."  Investigators suspect Monn climbed an 8-foot fence, broke into the pool snack bar through a window, threw nacho cheese on a wall and scattered chips on the ground.   About $40 in chips and $7 in nacho cheese were stolen.  Monn was charged with burglary, theft of less than $500, vandalism less than $500 and public intoxication and was cited for indecent exposure.   He was held at the Blount County Jail in lieu of a $9,300 bond.  It was Monn's 23rd birthday.    This incident occured about 15 miles from my hometown of Knoxville, TN. Also, please disregard the previous post stating that Tennessee is better than Kentucky.   Nacho cheese in his hair? Sounds like it was a helluva birthday party.

      Everyday I wake up and thank my lucky stars that I’m not in Kentucky. There are just some places that I would rather never have to live or visit if at all possible. But Michael, don’t you live in Tennessee? Yes, and Tennessee is very much different than Kentucky.  &nbsp;  For starters Tennessee simply sounds cooler than Kentucky. The name Kentucky is way too broken and sharp to the ears. Tennessee on the other hand flows out of the mouth like water from a fountain. Kentucky has horse racing which is a sport that I really enjoy watching, but Tennessee has every other sport and has them in massive quantity. Tennessee is not really too awful much like the rest of the South. I have lived in this state all of my life and have found that an extraordinarily high number of Northerners choose to make my state their home. Williamson County is the 11th wealthiest county in the entire United States. Kentucky, on the other hand, still has to deal with incest jokes and abject poverty. So, after all of this, my point. I want to live in New Zealand.  &nbsp;  I was looking online today for real estate to purchase. Not that I have any money, but winning the lottery is always a possibility. At LandAndFarm.com I stumbled across a 20 acre tract of land with beautiful views of pristine New Zealand countryside. I then realized that this is the place where I want to live the rest of my life. Enter Amanda and her naysaying.  &nbsp;  Amanda would never live in New Zealand because it has no “literary” history. I’m still not even sure what that means, honestly. I’m sure that people in New Zealand write books. They probably even have libraries come to think of it. This is one of the most terrible and ill-founded arguments that she has yet to come up with. I went into my diatribe about nature and the calm that such natural beauty would bring to a person. She then told me that she likes nature(Amanda doesn’t like to go outside when the temperature is above 75 degrees), but New Zealand is just too far away from everything. Getting away from everything is the point that I was trying to make to her.  &nbsp;  At that very moment I realized that I will probably live in Tennessee for the rest of my life. And while I can think of worse places to spend my time, I can also think of about a million places better than Tennessee.

      The Rolling Stones are a better band than the Beatles. As much as it pains me to make such a statement, I just can’t live the lie any longer. The Stones’ run of  Beggars Banquet ,  Let It Bleed , and  Exile on Main St . is the best run of albums any band has ever produced. The way that the Stones broke rock ‘n roll down to its country and blues roots is simply amazing. Methinks that “Gimme Shelter” off of  Let It Bleed  is the best rock song ever.  &nbsp;  The Beatles, of course, made excellent albums that are full of creativity and innovation. The run of  Revolver ,  Rubber Soul , and  Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band  is the second best run of albums to hit the ears of listeners. The Beatles chose to take what was present in music at the time and expanded and built on the foundation of rock ‘n roll. It’s like they were a spaceship that just took off from the launch pad and went into outer space and never returned.  &nbsp;  The Rolling Stones, conversely, chose to dig into the center of the music that spawned rock ‘n roll. When they got to the center they took a look around, analyzed the situation, and blew the damn thing up from the inside. After the dust cleared we were left with the purest rock ‘n roll ever made.  &nbsp;  Both bands are great in their own particular ways, I suppose. It just seems like the Stones got their hands dirty when they made those three albums. There haven’t been albums before or since that seem as authenticly rock ‘n roll as the Stones’ run from 1968-1972.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Last evening was grocery night for Amanda and me. This is our once weekly trip to the Kroger that normally results in a lot of yelling and throwing of groceries onto the ground and leaving without buying anything. So, in contrast to most grocery nights last night’s excursion was a success.   The outing was going fairly well with only a few minor skirmishes popping up here and there. Most notably was a minor war over whether to buy whole grain hamburger buns or regular hamburger buns. Amanda told me that she didn’t care which type of buns that we bought, but that when I need to be washed with a “rag on a stick” she’ll refuse to supply the necessary care. I simply rolled my eyes and picked up the white bread deliciousness in a bag. At this point everything was going rather swimmingly, but things took a sharp turn for the worse once we reached the health & beauty aisle.   I remembered that I was almost out of shampoo and went to pick up a bottle of Pantene Pro-V Classic Clean like I normally use for my hair. Amanda proceeds to chime in that it is ridiculous for me to pay $3.99 for a bottle of shampoo when I hardly have any hair. Yes, this is a true statement since I am indeed going bald and I normally have my hair cut very short. BUT……I want what hair I have to be happy and Pantene makes it happy. It keeps my head from being oily and when I do let my hair grow out a little bit it stays oil free as well. For some reason Amanda decided that she wanted to cock block my happiness. She proceeded to put up an extraordinary defense for the extra dollar that was about to be spent. I finally got the Pantene into the cart, but there was no reason why it should have been like smuggling someone across the Berlin Wall. In the end everything was all right. I got my Pepsi Cube and Pantene, but I lost Captain Crunch and Cocoa Puffs Milk and Cereal Bars. I suppose that the casualties were acceptable but I hate to leave anyone behind.      Also, over the past weekend I managed to convince Amanda to allow me to rent “Club Dread”. Once again the gents from Broken Lizard deliver comedic awesomeness. There are some extremely funny scenes and lines. My favorite scene would have to be when a group of visitors are playing some kind of game in a maze and the staff is dressed in giant fruit and snack outfits. Putman as “Banana” is most eggcellent. Some people hate Broken Lizard while others love them. I just don’t understand how some people can manage to be so anti-fun that they can’t enjoy these guys. Amanda is one of these people and it breaks my heart that she can openly hate the hilarity and shenanigans of this very talented comedy troupe. Maybe their next movie will thaw her fun-hating heart.

      I was quite surprised to learn that my home state of Tennessee was on the cover of USA Today this past Tuesday(the 6th). Seems as though our Governor and State Legislature have decided to drastically cut benefits for the state's Medicaid program, TennCare. After reading the article, which was very long and informative, my mind was immediately blown. This entire proposal demonstrates how little politicians care about the lower socio-economic groups of the state. The same can be said for national politics, but I will stay on the state level for the time being.   The article states that Tennessee spends something like 7.1 billion on state run health care programs. This includes a prescription drug program and child screening programs used for early identification of diseases in children. In summation, the state spends far more on TennCare than it does on education or any other state run program. The new proposed limitations include reducing the number of prescriptions available to six per month and limiting the total number of doctor's office visits to ten per year. I suppose that will work great as long as no one gets cancer, AIDS, diabetes, congenital heart problems, lupus, Parkinson's disease, Lou Gherig's disease, alzheimer's disease, or has to be placed on kidney dialysis. Obviously the state of Tennessee has developed cures for every single chronic disease known to man.  Also mentioned in the article was how the proposed changes could very likely alter the ways that private HMOs operate. Private HMOs could implement similar cutbacks and a more narrow definition of services provided, a la TennCare's lead.   The worst part of the whole mess is that our governor is a Democrat. As a member of the "working class party" shouldn't he try to salvage the best health care possible for the disadvantaged? I don't know, it's just a thought.  If congress accepts Tennessee's overhaul of the state Medicaid program other states will surely follow and begin limiting their own Medicaid programs. This cycle will surely continue until private insurors are the only option left. Big business wins and the poor lose. If this ain't America, I don't know what is!  *Seriously,I don't claim to have the answers for problems as large and complex as this one. I do ,however, advocate a federal health insurance program for every citizen in the United States of America paid for by our federal tax dollars. No, I'm not a socialist. I simply wish that everyone's tax dollars weren't used to build a military industrial complex that oppresses and threatens the entire world. Couldn't we cut defense spending by a third and in turn use that money to protect the health and welfare of the citizens of the Republic? I absolutely believe that my option, as opposed to the current administration's war mongering, is a true national defense initiative.

      When I arrived home this morning after work I was quite surprised to find a complete stranger sleeping on my couch. My first response to this situation was to find a baseball bat and start giving the stranger a “Casino” style beatdown. Before fear and adrenaline put me in my batting stance I came to my senses. This was Amanda’s sister’s friend. Whew! Another minute and she would have been a two run shot to deep right field. So, I go into the bedroom after I Scooby Dooed the situation in the living room and asked Amanda if we were running a homeless shelter. She said, “No”. I agreed. My attention was then turned to changing clothes and going out for some breakfast.     Amanda told me that she wouldn’t go out and eat breakfast with me this morning if I wore my Lightning Girls 16 & Under Fast Pitch Softball t-shirt. This absurdity almost made me lose my cool. I realize that the shirt is somewhat on the ridiculous side, being that I’m an overweight twenty-three year old male, but still. It’s not like the shirt has any holes, nor is it two sizes too small for my manly frame. I just couldn’t understand what she had against my Goodwill garment. Suddenly, lightning struck(pun intended)! Most of my clothes are from the Goodwill. I then realized that Amanda obviously hates charity and therefore hates my shirts by association. This thought brought tears to my beautiful blue eyes. I couldn’t believe it! My fiancée hates philanthropy.   After I cried on the inside for about an hour I tried to come to a conclusion based on the facts of the matter. I wasn't able to come up with an explanation that was more lenient towards the impoverished. Today is a black day indeed.

      Here we are at the United State’s 228th birthday. Huzzah, I guess. Unfortunately, I feel like I’m at the birthday party of someone that I used to be really great friends with, but for whatever reason we’ve grown apart. I think I know why America and I aren’t pals anymore, but I honestly hope that we can mend our differences and resume a happy coupling.   I often wonder why I should try to repair my friendship with America. The Republic that I came to know and love seems distant and unreachable. I don’t know where the qualities that originally attracted me to America have gone. I miss the civil liberties, separation of church and state, strong and fair foreign policy, and the quality domestic economic growth of years past. The America that I knew would never let legislation rule the lives of its citizens. Corporations and the wealthiest 1% wouldn’t be able to legislate for the other 99% of the population. Where has the Republic gone and what has assumed its identity?   I don’t like the doppelganger that calls itself The United States of America. A sad and cruel joke has replaced the bastion of freedom and equality that once stood in this very same place. Perhaps in a few years America will turn around and remember what made it the greatest nation that history has ever seen.
