      alrighty so i have a lj but figured i'd see if i can keep up with both a blog and lj because i know people in both places and it's easier to do this... right now life is good except dallas, new kitty, hurt his eye an hour after his vet visit. grrr. he looks up at me with one eye and cries and it's so sad but funny at the same time... i think pirate when he does it.... ok that's it for now in my not so exciting life... more to tell... err bitch about once i go back to work.

      i can't comment so i'm just going to post. you know if people are so concerned about others moving on then they need to stop starting shit... MY GOD! how hard is it to mind your own fucking business... going around telling others how horrible someone is, invading their private space, albiet a blog... but still their's... to go and start shit. just fucking move on... that means GET THE HELL OUT! don't fucking come around the blog, mind your own fucking business and let things go... no one is forcing you to read it but you just can't seem to fucking help yourself... get a damn life. and the people doing this i'm sure i'll piss off but seeing as how i've been to shows with them and know how "clicky" they are and the fact that i don't give a fuck about what they think... just leave everyone the fuck alone. you're not God, you don't have the right to butt into someone's personal affairs, and you are the most hypocritical group of people... it's ok for one person but not ok for someone else. alright i've said my peace for now... maybe more to come.

       last day of vacation with nothing to do... so sad.    is it normal to feel blah... i mean i'm happy, unbelievably happy but i just don't feel normal... maybe it's the going back to work or the money situation or the not seeing wesley everyday when i had grown accustomed to it... i'm sure that's it but grrr... i hate feeling indifferent about things. i rely on my emotions. everything is very emotional for me... that's the way i deal with things... i make decisions based on emotion that's how i know if it's right or not... yes, i've made mistakes and haven't always listened to my head or heart but i've gotten smarter and with that i've learned to listen to me... the way i feel, what my heart says and what my head thinks. and when one of those isn't "working" correctly i feel lost. i feel like i'm missing something inheritantly important to my life and i don't know what i need to make it right...
