      It's been two days since the last band practice...Although on that day I wasn't very pleased. Hahaz...no, no scoldings or anything like that. Okay, it was like this. Combine in the music room, playing all the songs we were doing for the upcoming performance..."Ok, take out your Final Countdown" Oh the joy of hearing that! Hehez...Final Countdown is my personal favourite...especially with myself at the drumset. He started, went around four bars into the song, and then stopped. "Ok, Final Countdown so easy, I don't think you all need to practice. Take out your Washington Post." KAOZ! I was havin so much fun (although it was only four bars) and he just stopped! Nevermind that. You should've seen the look on my face. =p  Number two for lost opportunities! The final part for the practice; the great competition repertoire! Only me and one of my juniors were on the snare drum then. He turned to face me and said..."Khairul, this is our big solo!" I nodded back, skillfully throwing my sticks into the air and catching them on the other side. "Let's do this!" The excitement was there...we were revved up and ready to go...  The fanfare began, and adrenaline rushed inside of me...and when it ended, it happened again! He stopped again...and said "Go to 197!" DUDE! THAT'S LIKE, THE END OF THE REPERTOIRE ALREADY! Oh well, gotta put up with it. Hope that doesn't happen again...=p Alright, I think I've said enough...

      Yes, I am forgetting her...slowly but surely...but there's only one thing that keeps bothering me...Everytime I see her, I still have this strange feeling inside me...I don't quite know how to explain it...I just feel it. It's becoming pretty hard for me to do this...Frankly, I don't really know if I can. But I knew from the start of this that it would be better for the both of us...Especially after I was enlightened by my god-ma on that fateful day...  I always saw Her as the perfect little angel, cute and lovable, very kind, very...laughable. At that time I knew she'd be the one for me. But it might have been my fault that it didn't work out, as I am obviously horrible at initiating a relationship. I dunno why, don't ask me. Should get the Idiot's Guide to Love thingy...or what's it called...Anyway, after that day in the canteen, I realized Her true self. (Please...don't mind me typing this...) She, as I had always thought, (although I refused to believe) was a flirt...Yes, there, I said it. She liked to hang around with other guys, acting so close to them. Of course you would know how I felt when that happened. (You know, I really don't mind now.) But in spite of that I perservered, trying every ways and means to get her attention, but to no avail.  When I finally decided that I'd give up all hopes of starting anything with her, I was torn apart, basically. It felt like, Slash, criss cross, jab, slice, then ripped, quartered, then torn to little pieces...Yes, it was a tough decision (apart from what I had to decide on before that...Ughh...) But it was sensible as I had thought, and the same with my peers. I knew I'd done the right thing...  Just seeking to do well with what I have now...and cherish others who truly care for me...I learnt a lot from this...Can you tell? Nevermind. Thanks God-Ma!!

      One thing learnt today in the life of copying conductor scores...KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE FRICKIN' NOTES! Yeah, it DID happen to me today. I was, you know, practicing writing scores for the band sections...and I was actually doing a 3rd Clarinet score...alright...a semiquaver here...half rest, and FINALLY, a quaver to end it all! Oh, the joy in completing almost half an hour or hard work...but little did I know... ... Enter Kenrick... "Very good...so fast finish? hm...wait a minute...aren't you supposed to be doing the 3RD CLARINET score?" He said...a chill trickled its way down my spine...I then realized..."OH CRAP! THIS SCORE IS FOR 1ST CLARINET!!!" Man, you can't EVER realize the pain...Hahaz...Lesson learnt...KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN!! =p

      Something BIG happened today...something REALLY BIG...Too bad I have sworn not to dig any deeper or reveal anything related. And with that, I have decided NOT to go deeper into this issue. It's hurtin' me as much as them, trust me. Woohoo! BAND TOMORROW!!! Can't wait...The new songs roxorz...but there's just this one thing...I'M GOING TO CONDUCT ONE OF THEM!!! This shocking sh*t smacked me in the face when my the P man announced it during the last band practice...Yes, I should be confident, but the skill of conducting leaves a lot to be desired. Take me under your instruction, Kenrick!!! Teach me to be like you!!! Or...maybe not. Just teach me how to be a great conductor... =p Well, about the relationship thing...I've made up my mind...to completely give up on it. Truthfully, I don't really see any future with myself going on like a love blinded idiot. Why should I torture myself with this thing when I can use the lost time to make up for what I have now? Didn't really see things that way before last week...I was truly blinded by love. But rest assured I won't let this thing happen for a long long time. I WILL NOT! (For the time being). And kudos to Lisa Cheng for tearing off part of my shirt pocket. Oh how I longed for the beautiful satisfying sound of cotton and polyester ripping apart. The great moment. The hanging pocket. Excellent...First my pants pocket, now my SHIRT pocket...what next? I'll leave that up to her to decide...The great Punut Pincher...Don't blame me for calling her that. Hahaz...I just realized something...why waste my love on someone unworthy, when I waste it on other people? I love my family, my friends...(Yes, I do have a great love, yes, I do mean love, for all my friends. Some are bastards, some are bitches, but, yes, I do love them as friends.) Okay, that's enough...OWWWWWWWWCHHH!!! Gettin a cramp in my little finger! Gotta go! =D

      Phew...After a tiring day at band...well...my eyes are sore...and the worst thing about it is...I have absolutely no idea why. Man, I'd hate to tell you this, but I kinda hate too much responsibility. Sure, I'll try to cope with upcoming events, but sometimes it just gets too much for me. Plus I got another thing on my mind today, with the help of my beloved god-ma, to bother me for quite some time. In fact, it's been bothering me for a VERY long time. I'm having second thoughts about initiating a relationship, or in short, I'm thinking of giving up on a girl I've truly loved for the past year. Whether she feels it or not, I don't really care anymore. I just cant't take the pain of loving someone and not having her feel the same for me...oh well. Put the bad things behind you and get along with life...Gee, this blogger thing is really helping me relieve some stress...=p

      Yet another day of fun-filled, exciting, exhilarating...slacking at home after a terrible weekend. Hopelessly sick for three days in a row with hardly any energy to lift a finger and generating heat like a nuclear power plant, yeah, I was just there...lyin' around, trying to get those weird voices out of my head. But look on the bright side! Oops...wait...what bright side...Oh no matter, a great day in band tomorrow will definitely cheer me up. I can't wait to see all my pals and tap that ol' drum of mine. *yawnz*...hm....those antibiotics are really deep. Well, gotta go shake them off with a can of beer...hehe...just kiddin'. See ya!

      Hey, YOU! Yes YOU! You brainless moronic backstabbing bastards! I just don't get the idea of you IGNORANT people doing this kind of thing! Yes, I know, you may be bursting with laughter and jumping with joy when you see me venting my anger on this little post here, but LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING!                                      If YOU (********************) don't like something about the BAND, YOU JOLLY WELL COME HERE *poinTs to the ground* AND TELL IT TO US STRAIGHT! BY DOING THIS KIND OF STUPID THING AND BREAKING APART SOMETHING BUILT OVER YEARS, YOU ARE FORCING ME TO SHATTER YOUR BONES AND RIP OUT YOUR INNARDS! DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE DONE? OH, NO, OF COURSE NOT! YOUR BRAINS ARE TOO FULL OF STUPID IDEAS THAT BRING HARM TO OTHERS! WELL SINCE YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA, LET ME TELL YOU!  YOU HAVE JUST MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER KNOWN TO MANKIND! YOU HAVE BROKEN UP THE BOND THAT HAS HELD TWO BANDS TOGETHER FOR THE PAST TEN OR SO YEARS! I HAVE MADE MISTAKES IN THIS BAND, BUT NONE OF THEM AS STUPID AND IDIOTIC AS THIS! WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR HEADS?   WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?   To all the Seniors, and to Mr Poh, thanks alot for all you've done for me and the band. Without you, we would've never reached this point, although this may not be our peak. Mr Poh, all the punishments, all the scoldings, all were worth it. Yes, you DO scold sometimes for the fun of it, but mostly, yes, I was in the wrong. Seniors, all the time you spent in the field with us, all the things you taught us, the scoldings (too.) you've given us, all paid off on April 17th, and even after that you never failed to carry on what you've been doing for the past 7-8 months. You have the band's as well as my utmost gratitude.  As for Mr Poh leaving the bands, I really hope you do find something you can really do and love doing in the future, and may you score with distintion in all your subjects. Uphold what you've achieved in year 1, don't forget it! You have our fullest support to the very end.  Lastly, to all the Majors and past committee members; I have never seen a better system, EVER. You have helped Mr Poh to maintain and improve the standard that these bands have achieved. Without you, this band would have fallen years ago. Thank You.   P.S. You sons (and daughters) of b****es, you will NEVER come to a good end! Die a horrible death and never be remembered! SO LONG! Muahahaz

      WoaH...havenT been updating my bLog lately...some of my *ahem* avid readers may have noTiced...havenT you? Hahaz...de performance at Fengshan CC yesterdaE was a bLast...had lots of fun. Although where we performed our repertoire wasn't actually IN the CC...but rather outside...across the street in the middle of a couple of HDB blocks. Not many people were seen there...save a few groups in the concourse area and perhaps alot more up in the corridors looking down at the Titans below. ~TITANS RULE!~   We acTually had to repeat a few songs over again...around two songs were played twice...the competition repertoire was one of them...man...my arms were about to fall off after the second one...=D Well well, who would've known? Zack continued the tradition I set during my first year in the band. During every major performance since I started playing the drumset I would ALWAYS drop my stick(s) while playing Tequila. Hahaz...Zack wanted to play the song yesterdae, so I let him. And little did I know what was coming. He dropped both sticks during the solo part and I had to take over and recover. He's learning I can see. Although he seemed pretty phobious of the drumset after that incident. He still has a lot to learn...I don't blame him. Neither does the band.  The preparation and the keeping of the chairs and intruments was a horror...much time was taken up. I still remember the time when one of the toms dropped right off the drumset after my junior (who shall NOT be named) attempted to carry it all the way. The poor guy had to hold on to the tom whilst we used the drumset in case it fell off. I guess my section leader's words didnt entirely get into his head. We let him hold on to something that would'nt fall apart when he touched it after the performance.  Surprisingly, I wasn't a bit nervous while conducting Final Countdown...I just went with the flow, and the band followed intently. Luckily I remembered to go faster after the first four bars...And I felt so relieved when I didn't mess up big time during my own drumset solos...Thanks to Ben for not holding the last note so long...=P Yeah...great day that was...Need to prepare for the MOE rehearsal tomorrow...I think I've written enough...cyaz!!

      I...read a couple of friends' bLogs recently...and I noticed that there was sort of a...link between them...And...well...When I discovered it I was actually on the verge of crying...I mean...this thing is...big...really big. AffecTs me alot...it will, I guess. This may very well mark the end of something buiLt over years. Something I want to see go on, insTead of just stopping in its tracks and  shattering.               So, then...I do hope that there really is no link between these bLogs...I do hope so. eRmz...if...you know, you'rE reading this, I really hope you two...you know, sort things ouT?

      Looks like I'm still feelin it for her...although I don't know why...You should know who laHz...I dunno...Today She came for band, and for some reason I just could'nt take my eyes off her for one second. I realized that I couldn't just 'forget' Her as and when I wished...It'd take time. Now that's the most painful part in this little chapter. I'm making progress, as I know, but I seriously don't know how long it'll take to really go back to how it was before.   On the way home after band...was with CY the language-challenged one and a few others at Bedok Interchange...Something else happened...The most unexpected, as I would say. She and a guy (who shall not be named) walked past, I think She noticed us, but I didn't really pay attention. Yes, He was sending her home. No business of mine. But somehow I started pressing on the bottle in my left hand. After a bit, the bottle was completely crushed under my fingers...Pain? Anger, perhaps? This is getting too much, I think.   It's just that...with my position in *ahem* 'society' right now, it isn't right to carry on like this. I seriously want to get away from this thing, but it will take time. Although I do hope it doesn't take too long...  Band arHz? Fun lah todae...Not really for my section members though...Sectional marching the whole morning till noon. I feel sorry for them frankly...=p Oh come on, I'm not being sarcastic...I'm the caring compassionate type, you know? I was busy writing scores for the sideliners...no choice, Kenrick told me to do it. Mostly marching today, unlike the past few practices (rather enjoyable, those...) So happy that we completed the Firebird formation today...Best Band award is in the bag!! =p =D =O

      Just sorta made things clear lasT nitE with sammie...yes, I know, she's a good girl and a fine choice, but I just don't want to get another taste of the pain I've feLt not too long ago. I need to busy my life with something else other than love. Oh how wrong I was to try and start it off long long ago...only to fail in the end...  Tomorrow is a band dae...I'm expecting a few BORING hours of secTionaLs and then combine when the 20 or so peopLe return from the rehearsaL...We're playing so many new songs! Alvamar, Folklore, Inferno...Inferno of which is soOoOoOoOo hard...grade 5 worz...highest grade in band music (or is it?) and if the percussion score can already make you dizzy, what about the woodwinds? Horrifying...LoLz. Alvamar was surprisingly easy to sighTread on the first day...I can't say the same for the rest of the band. I do consider percussion one of the easiest sections in the band (no offense, percussionisTs)  Really looking forward to playing all these songs toMorroW...Wah...my wriTing hand very pain worz...had to copy 4 chinese compos juz nw...punishMenT lahz...stupid mdm wan...aiya...in a rush to go homE...so juZ copy 3 n stuff it in the pigeoN hoLe outside the staff room...  Oh well...that's it...hand pain...cyaZ!

      So ends the final chapter of the Titans...Just a few days ago the great band had separated and gone their own separate ways...and soon Ping Yi will have a new instructor...Ong Tee Hoe I think...Although I'm quite grateful that Mr Poh would agree to stay longer with Springfield...I remember the first day when we combined with Ping Yi...the opening of a new chapter...The time when we got to know the Ping Yians and make new friends...The time when I wasn't punished so much...=p  Many months, countless days and hundreds of hours under the merciless scorching sun had come to this, and ended as quickly as it had began. It all went by so fast, as it seemed...Brings me back to the time when I just came into the Springfield band...The day when I picked up my first pair of drumsticks. Although I was aloof and over confident at that time...I slowly came to grow attached to the band and developed great respect for my superiors. Kind of like my Drum Major when he first entered the band, eh?  As the final hour went past we were there standing on the track waiting for the march in command...The last 8 minutes on that glorious field...And then we would march out again onto the track...facing the grandstand filled with thousands of people to await the results of the competition. The best Drum major award was passed, then the best Display Band award...And then I realized, that for this year...It just wasn't meant to be. Although we didn't get anything in the end...Mr Poh was very pleased with our performance; perhaps the best we've accomplished so far in these 8 months.  And little did I realize...when we were back on the grass patch outside the stadium getting ready to head on back to school...that after the next few hours the Titans would go their separate ways...Maybe we wouldn't see each other for the next two years, when the bands come together again, or maybe forever, if we were to enter alone. So many things left unfinished...so many questions left unanswered... ... ...  But this formation of the Titans has forged me into someone I knew I could never be. In the past 8 months I had learnt countless things...techniques, virtues, character. Every practice helped me in one way or another. This was no waste of time, surely. The seniors came back to help us and guide us in our quest toward the Gold, and in the end, we got it.   And this is the start of a new beginning. Almost everything will change, but the biggest change to me...will be when he leaves after 30th July. Seems to me that I won't be learning as much as I did before. Seems I won't accomplish as much as I did before...So many things... So many things...
