       Wh en i was 16 i lost a dear lover in a herindous car crash that happened out side my fathers house.&nbsp; I was transformed in a loner and a careless searcher.&nbsp; My world had crumbled in my hands and i didn't even know it.&nbsp; My benevolent lover had been thrown out of the windshield of a 98 Ford Mustang Gt.&nbsp; You see i think that the lord leads us unto people by using people.&nbsp; I believe that my story is meant to be heard.&nbsp; It opens up new wounds every time i talk about it but it is beter heard and learned from then not.&nbsp;  Take my advise:     &nbsp;  If you have something Special to you don't take advantage of you either else the lord will take it from you Period.&nbsp; Live and Learn.

      Live and Learn from my mistakes...   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every one finds what they think to be a true lover... Well, I thought that too.&nbsp; I believe that even the best of the Romantics have faults... I am what you could call a HOPELESS ROMANTIC.&nbsp; I can give all of this great advise, but i can't use it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to find out a way to tell a certain girl that i care for her but i dont know how to tell her i care for her.&nbsp; But i can give advise to people how they should do it.&nbsp; Strange huh?

          This is   the home of all things that are mysterious and strange; Painful and pleasurable.&nbsp; If you have a question leave me a way to return you an answer.&nbsp; I am a very intelligent person who will take every thing into consideration...&nbsp; Trust me with your thought because I trust you to tell me.&nbsp; I am a lonely walker of the night.&nbsp; I am Atlas the god who holds the world upon his back... Sometimes I can be Aries the god ready for war at a wink of an eye... Only you can set the mood... Trust my words because they have helped many... Remember I may walk the night but I can also ride the blazing sun.&nbsp; I was told that the world would love a man who could RENDER THE MOON... Well,&nbsp; You tell me should I try to render the moon or should I just continue my quest as Oz unto the little Dorothy?
