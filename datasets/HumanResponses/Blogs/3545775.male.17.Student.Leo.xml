      Just got this: a piece by  Sable. X. Veins  entitled:    "... On the Role of the Humble Cigarette in the Maintenance of Diversity of Thought"   Hitler was one of the finest leaders Great Britain ever had.  The advancement of technology, class redefinition, and sociological ethos-shift from mindless, unquestionable Imperialism to more liberal, rationalising Pacifism engendered by two implausibly devastating wars shattered the unspoken Nationalist reasoning of a philosophically apathetic populace:  "Heroes don't ask why."  My point is, the only surefire way of ensuring that systems of thought retain a creative level of mutability is by throwing a spanner in the works (excuse the cliché).  If dissidents and nonconformists do not occupy themselves by opposing and occasionally smashing up majority-endorsed value sets, politics, art, and so on, how is it possible to continue the evolution and creation of new, different, hitherto minority-endorsed value sets, politics, art, et cetera?  Even if these turn out to be negative, unworkable concepts -- Communism, as an example -- the very fact that they were allowed to hold sway, even for a little while, can force massive social and philosophical trend-shifts into motion.  Without Communism, would we now have a Democratic Russia?  How about a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament?   Without Communism, would we now have the originally severely left-wing opposition to the long-established government predictabilities of the Tory and Whig parties?  Spinning this web of What Ifs to its plausible limits, without Communism, would Iraq still exist under the free thought-oppressive régime of a certain abuser of the power of Religion?  Addictive, suicidal, antisocial -- smoking is just one of the many apparently unnecessary and somewhat petulant rebellions against the accepted norm.  Once, it was held to be highly desirable, but has now been pushed into remission, as is right and proper in order to maintain... *fanfare* ...Diversity.    Maybe enough on the subjects of Cures for Cancer and, ironically, autodestructive social conformity, has been gained from it?  Maybe.  Although, by representing an unfashionable minority, it can yet help to maintain variety of thought.  Accept it, deny it, overcome it, but do not dismiss it.  To dismiss the unfashionable minority is to dismiss any hope of change.  "Difference for the sake of Difference!" I hear critics cry -- but surely, so long as the Spanner of Change disrupts the Cogs of Establishment regularly enough to ensure variety and creativity, it does not matter what the motive of the Rogue Mechanic was? The type of unthinking acceptance of institutionalisation exhibited by PSHE class converts across the land, epitomised in the indoctrinated opinion "Nobody would want to date a smoker anyway", is but an historically well-known paradigm and a few plausibly supported propaganda arguments removed from the type of unthinking acceptance of institutionalisation exhibited by the morally irrational moronic crusaders who have fallen prey to "Democratic" government brainwashing...  Perhaps our purported Heroes of the Cause of Truth, Democracy and Western Monopoly should stop for a moment, stop by the next dissident, unfashionable minority for a cigarette, stop and ask, "Why?"    /Sable X.

      Well, I did promise some more stuff for today, and here it is: Having watched ER (as in, the American hospital drama, created my Michael Crichton, among others) for some time, I've begun to notice some trends within the program - it appears that the parallel universe in which the series is set (for it must be an alternate reality; where else would a slight upon a patient ensue in a vengeful tank rampage?) is controlled by a malevolent right-wing deity, determined to impose its values on a rather liberal cast of character. This manifests itself mainly in the punishment by "acts of God" of those who transgress against a rather reactionary unspoken moral code. (as an aside, I want to point out that the comments below in no way represent my opinion, rather the apparent beliefs of the writers of the series.) For example, in the last series alone, Dr. Carey was punished for her lesbianism, and, more topically, her marriage to her partner, by the death of said partner (a heroic firewoman, probably "lead astray" at some point), and the virtual abduction of their child by her wife's unsympathetic family. Dr Carter, an otherwise "blameless" character; clearly Aryan and fresh-faced (and a multi-millionaire to boot), makes the mistake of falling in love with not only a black woman, but one who does not endorse the US' medical policies abroad with regard to AIDS in Africa. Moreover, she has a clearly European/British accent and is uncomfortably independent of the good doctor. To cut a convoluted plotline short, she eventually falls pregnant by Varter, but the pregnancy results in a miscarriage, in what seems like a punishment for so-called "miscegenation". There may seem to be little point to my rantings on this subject, but in my (admittedly warped) mind it strikes me as a rather worrying subliminal encroachment of neoconservative values in popular culture - often an excellent indicator of political climate, especially in high-profile U.S. television dramas. Enough of my babblings. I'll go and find some more pretty pictures to deaden your brains with.

      ...or, more likely, whoever's listening. Having finally got sick of editing an 8-page HTML document whenever I wanted to voice my opinions, I have finally relented and got myself a nice Blogger account. Therefore, readers can expect more updates, more frequently, and better archiving than my measly web design skills can provide. In my absence, I have mainly been making photoshoppy type things at  urlLink b3ta , which is fun, albeit life-eating. You can see some of my diseased imaginings at  urlLink my MSN Group , which I have implemented because the lovely people at Freeservers won't let me remote link. Hopefully coming soon: An article about the right-wing subtext in ER, and some lovely paintings...

      Advertisements really do form a low point in current day-to-day human affairs, particularly in the case of television adverts.  That's not to say that I don't understand the need for adverts or appreciate this fact, it's just the way modern advertising companies go about it that makes the fruits of their labours so painful to experience.  These days, I'd say that there are three main types of television advertisement:  1.  The Bearable Ones.   These are the ones that don't make you want to scream like a ferret in acid the first time you see them, and might even make you chuckle.  They might be witty, clever, or just have some attribute that lends a certain air of coolness or watchability to them.  Of course, after seeing this advert repeated a number of times, the novelty will wear off, and they will either become boring or irritating, and the desire to claw your ocular organs out will return.  At any rate, it's rare that the viewer will actually be interested in the product that's being sold; the likelyhood is that they just like watching the advert.  Until it's repeated three times in half an hour, that is.   Example:  That Guiness ad with the surfing and the horses made of waves.  2.  The Nauseatingly Irritating Ones.   These are without a doubt the most commonplace.  Often accompanied by an absurd "theme tune" specially designed by Advertologists to make you projectile vomit, adverts of this variety will try to get you to by their putrid and often totally absurd wares by being as loud, bright, cheerful, stupid or annoying as possible.  Perhaps the idea behind these adverts is to assault the viewer as much as possible until all their defenses have been systematically destroyed by the sheer horror onscreen and they'll buy anything that you throw at them.  This terror is compounded by the huge number of times this advert will be displayed.  Typical values range between twenty and twenty-five times a minute.   Example:  The McDonalds advert with the screeching kids that want to know "What's in the Box That Always Rocks".  I'll tell you what's in the fucking box.  The last shreds of my precious sanity.  And a side order of fries.  3.  The Arrogant Ones.  The adverts that display products that are SO FUCKING BRILLIANT that you, the lowly consumer, are barely worthy of feasting your filthy beady eyes on, let alone owning.  These adverts will often be accompanied with a voiceover from some smarmy dickhead quietly (and arrogantly, let us not forget) asserting just how totally fantastic the product is.  The advert will most probably be simple in nature because no embellishments are good enough for whatever item is being flogged.  These are by far the worst kind.  Whilst variety two has the advantage of sheer numbers, a single exposure to just one of these adverts is enough to make the viewer feel violated, both mentally and physically.   Example:  Those "Read a Bestseller Every Day" Telegraph adverts.  Who the fuck stands in an elevator discussing which issue of a fucking  newspaper  was the best?  Seriously, extract your heads from your rectal cavities, people.  Naturally, these do not cover all adverts, as some perpetrators have special and terrifying categories all of their own, but I do reckon that this covers most of what's on offer for anyone who feels their sanity to be burdensome.  As far as I can tell, the last two categories seem to follow relatively simple formulae for construction.  These are as follows:   The Nauseatingly Irritating Ones:   1.  Write a "jingle" for the advert.  This should, ideally be short and punchy and repeated every two nanoseconds.  The concept behind this is that it will destroy enough of the viewers braincells (usually all of them) that they'd be willing to go out and buy whatever godawful sack of shit that your company is selling.  2.  Get some actors to be irritating/stupid/very irritating.  If this product has anything to do with children even in the slightest, hire some annoying little brats to be very loud.  Extra points awarded for jumping up and down like a retarded monkey on acid.  Otherwise, hire some adults to be loud instead.  Remember, the louder you are, the better your product must be.  Punctured eardrums mean people can hear better!  3.  Write an absurd catchphrase.  Repeat it constantly in your advert, then plaster it  everywhere  so that the unsuspecting public can do nothing but associate with your product whenever they come across one of the catchphrase's component letters.  There is no escape.   The Arrogant Ones:   1. Bend over until arsehole is visible.  2. Thrust cranium upwards into anus.  3. Pick up a pen.  4. Write advert.  5. Get the smarmy wanker to do the voice over.  6. Apply soft green/blue tint or black-and-white.  I hope this has been informative for you.  If anyone attempts to put the methods I have described into use, please do us all a huge favour and end your life now.  Thank you.  -T

      I am not going to talk about football.  That would be far too topical.  Football is a rather bad example, actually, as I'm not likely to discuss it, topical or otherwise.  No, I am going to talk about pigeons.  It all started when the one known as Veins and I decided that we were hungry.  Making Ben uncomfortable by attempting to follow him to Hughenden (where he was reported to be meeting a friend of the female persuasion*) is tiring and hunger-inducing work.  So, the merry debate as to where to eat began.  The final candidates for consideration were Kentucky Fried Fastfoods, or McFastfoods.  As the former was closer to where we were at the time, we decided upon it, and made our way over.  As we approached the establishment, I paused in my musings on the odds of finding a cyst in my meal** (which I decided were favourable because I was rather hungry) in order to partake in a cursory look into the "restaurant".  My companion must have done the same, as we both immediately squealed in horror like the little girls that we are; there was a particularly ratty (and most indubitably heavily diseased) pigeon wandering around the foyer where the food is ordered and collected.  Both the staff and the customers (and especially the staff) seemed entirely unconcerned by this event, as if a disgusting and particularly disease-ridden (honorary) rodent that is not only horrible  but can also fly  turning up in the foyer is a regular, if not daily occurrence and of no particular note.  No attempt had been made to shoo it away or indeed do anything about its presence, and the worst thing was that there was nothing stopping it taking flight over the counter and into the nearest vat of fries.  At this point, my imagination broke out of its cage and ran around my mind, tipping over furniture, drawing on the walls and generally terrorising the other occupants.  Consequently, I could almost hear someone with a Spanish accent shouting, "Oh no!  José, the livestock is escaping!  How will we make our delicious burgers now?!"  I am imagining a fellow called José, because I am sure that I was once served by a Spanish or Mexican guy in there, and as I do not know his real name, calling him José makes me happy.  As for the other Spanish person, what's the point in having someone shouting "José" if it is not done in a Spanish accent?  Anyway, after much loud assessing of the situation, and some gratuitous usage of the phrase "What the fuck," we departed and took our business to McFastfoods, who at least have the decency not to parade the live contents of their burgers by the door.  And now, suddenly, for no apparent reason, I am suffering from some sort of a terrifying Dèja Vú feedback loop.  If I don't make it, tell Veins to get his filthy hands off my stereo.  -Thaddeus "B." Glands (The "B." stands for "Good Vibrations"!)  ---------- * One cannot be too sure of this, however, as when he offered to show me a photo of her he had in his wallet, he instead showed me a photo of himself. ** I've heard "stories", you see.  Listening to these is probably a bad idea, but I refuse to pay any attention to this until someone tells it to me in "story" form.

      So. This is it. We lost to Portugal in the quarter finals of Euro 2004.  I think first we must have a compulsory rant about how unfair it was:  "BLAH BLAH BLAH REF NEEDS GLASSES BLAH BLAH BLAH GREASY DAGO OILSLICK BLAH BLAH BLAH CHEATING BLAH BLAH BLAH HE WAS OBVIOUSLY BIASED BLAH BLAH BLAH WE WAS ROBBED BLAH BLAH BLAH GREATEST INJUSTICE SINCE MARADONA BLAH BLAH BLAH."  That said, I personally am dreading the events that will take place in two years time. That's right, the World Cup. And not just any World Cup, but the 2006 World Cup. And we all know what 2006 is, don't we, children?  That's right, 40 years from 1966, which is when we won the World Cup. And so, tabloid supporters will work themselves up into a paroxysm of patriotic apoplexy. Sven-Goran Eriksson will be placed under even more media pressure to steer his team to victory. David Beckham will get his mug in the papers even more than he already does. Wayne Rooney will be hyped to the hilt even more than he has been. Pundits will engage in a never-ending barrage of statistic swapping, player rating, and a false sense of importance. "Three Lions" will be re-released yet again, only now it'll be "FORTY years of hurt." It will be fairly safe to say that, at at least one point, the entire hopes and dreams of the English nation will rest on the toes of Michael Owen.   Here's my predictions for the 2006 World Cup:  1. We will get to the quarters, possibly the semis, and then die in flames.  2. This position will not be good enough for the press, who will insist on the resignation of Beckham/Sven/both.  3. It'll all blow over, and we'll be resigned to trying again come Euro 2008.  Oh well.  Football. It's a funny old game.

      I am half American.  Feel free to hate me for this.  Feel free, furthermore, to sit and swivel.  Anyroad, I was shocked to discover, a few years ago, that many American boys are circumcised, not for religious reasons, not due to deformity, but  as a matter of course , after birth.   The primary argument for this spurious, outdated medical mutilation of the alledgedly superfluous flap of flesh adorning the newborn's penis is that if left intact, the foreskin can trap filth and smegma, leading to infection.  Well, this is certainly true, but only for members who are not washed regularly.  I am sure that many of a man's appendages would require surgical removal if his level of hygiene were consistently this poor.  Is the mere  possibility  of infection truly reason enough to continue this archaic and dangerous practice?  By the same argument, boys direct from the freshly voided womb of their mothers would have their appendices removed, lest they at some time develop appendicitis; or have their vestigial tails cropped, against the day when fragments of shattered coccyx puncture the prostate.  Furthermore, even if ablutively misguided males do develop subcultures in this protective region, there is nothing to stop them... washing there and getting rid of it.  Or... circumcising then,  when  it has become a problem.  If the US developed an AIDS endemic, would government nurses visit infected communities and weld latex sheaths onto every new boy?  It does not seem quite so implausible when faced with their illogical treatment of this insignificant danger.  It is high time that the needless clinical damage to the most psychologically significant and genetically creative organ of unconsenting male infants is ceased.  It just concerns me that this mindless pre-emption of monsters-under-the-bed that will only appear if the populace fails to maintain basic reserves of common sense is somewhat indicative of the governmental thought processes of my nation.    /Veins

      Skinning his knees on the gravel as he fell, Iosaiph realised that he had strayed into a horror story. The blood, lying innocuous on the path bore witness. Because of certain events in the past, he had not shed blood for a good while. The only question that now remained was whether he was protagonist or antagonist, for of his monstrosity there was no doubt.  He was not a short man, but neither was he tall. Shaking off the remnants of a folk song that had entangled itself around his left ankle, the scarred man raised himselfto his true, unnatural height, and sniffed the air. There would be difficulties further along, he foresaw, but with a bit of skill it would come to a satisfactory conclusion. In the bushes, something nameless and hairy breathed subtle-toothed threats of unspeakable degradations, and so the man moved on swiftly. As he was not in the moood just then. The trees about were the sepia monochrome of twenty-year-old newspaper, and all the branches pointed in the same direction. This was to be expected. What was more, at the end of the path, just visible in the distance, squatted a shadowy construction, simultaneously nebulous and disconcertingly solid. It was quite clearly a house, devoid of ambiguity, and probably filled with gibbous, scabious tebleaux devised by a being devoidof restraint, or, indeed, dictionary.  Something followed behind.  Something Else waited ahead.  Everything was going according to plan.  Iosaiph smiled, and teeth sharper than any teeth had a right to be glinted between lips like twin gashes on the back of a voluptuary. His goal was near. Behind his eyes, an inchoate sigil of depravity and violence churned ,and most likely chittered as well. He walked faster now, through the pain and the silent-grey wood. There was a shadow on the path ahead.  The shadow blocked his way.  "You shall not pass", it shrieked from its gibbet, but a with word from the unkempt and magnificent being before it, the thing shattered into wholeness and flapped off to haunt some other beknighted genre.  The man breathed heavily. Things were moving almost too fast for his splintered manipulations. Feigning mortal terror, he glanced over his shouilder occasionally as he jogged from the maw of the forest to the waiting wings and anticipatory arms of the dark house, all the while trying to ignore the blood streaming from the cuts on his knees.  At the door, hunter and prey paused, picked up a half-brick lying in the ruins of the porch, and nonchalently opened the door with a finesse of duress.  When the horror came for him, pseudopodia and jewellery of infant mortality jangling-  -Iosaiph hit it unexpectedly hard with the aforesaid bit of masonry, hurled its oozing, eerie corpse into the shrubbery, and escaped though the door into the house, beyond the story.  It had all gone rather well, considering.

      ...cos I start writing shit like this.  Now that my good friend Withiel has been plied with enough mind-altering snuff powder to allow me to post directly rather than by proxy (as with my article on the subject of the general desirability of smoking and how bloody good it is for you, and you, and yes, small rumple-haired unattractively-proportioned-faced child, you too), I  really  should stop staying up this late, because I  really  have no idea where this sentence was going or how I should finish it.  To the point... am I the only "musician" on this Godforsaken (and therefore, since God "is" omnipresent, NONEXISTENT (Q.E.D.(take that, O mighty cliché-creating theologian phrase-coiners))) nebula of perception that has noticed how much that chap what percusses for the Foo Fighters looks like Kurt Cobain?  Irony, anybody?  I think we should be told.  Furthermore, I am somewhat concerned about the direction that popular, and even underground, alternative music has been taking recently.  It all seems to tend towards what is commonly known as "Emo".  The Common or Garden variety of Emo has its roots in somewhat unimaginative punk bands ("Surely not!" I hear ye cry) who cash in on the hormonal angst of impressionable adolescents by tearing out heavy-hearted, self-lacerating pieces on the Joys of Getting Dumped, or Having Your Girlfriend Killed in a Car-Crash, or Being Cheated Upon*, or Coming from a Broken Home, or Missing Your Girlfriend, or Killing Your Girlfriend, or Being Killed by Your Girlfriend who has been Cheating Upon** You Whilst Your Divorcee Parents Get Killed in a Car Crash Moments After Their Joyful Reconciliation When, Just for a Moment, it Looks Like Everything Might Turn Out Okay, But Oh No, Luckily We've Fucked It All Up Again So That We can Sing About It and Make Lots of Money...  The themes are few, but the permutations un-finite.  As enjoyable as Emo is (and what with being a huge closet supporter of the genre myself, I oughtn't throw stones), it is attaining a dangerously high level of general acceptance (haha, phonetic pun).  Any locus of sonic mediocrity that wants to make a stain on the world and gain the love and fanaticism of viewers of pop music channels like Kerrang, or even (marginally) more alternative outlets such as MTV2, need only churn out some "heart-rending" "tear-jerker" lyrical nonsense with a repeating treble appogiaturic motif (usually on undistorted electric guitar, acoustic guitar, or piano) over the top of The Emo Riff (perfect V - diminished V - I).  And it works every time.  And, which is worse, I  still  like it.  Everyone likes it.  Wallowing in your own emotions is one of the few sadomasochistic pleasures still deemed acceptable in polite society.  Protest about the anguish of emotional burden all you like, it is nonetheless true that you  enjoy  the psychological self-mutilation, deep within yourself.  I believe it is a worthwhile portion of the Human Experience, for if you have not allowed yourself to indulge in your own mysterious psychological fetishes, or remain virgin to the reportedly less pleasant emotional cruises, you have not truly experienced the vibrant range of existential sensations that, it can be argued, define you.  Bearing in mind my earlier musing on the maintenance of [alarums] Diversity of Thought, you might say that this may well be no bad thing.  However, I like my art to exist in a state of constant variety rather than linear temporal variety; having the two in conjunction is, furthermore, preferable to either on its own.  To put it another way: I bore easily.  When I am done with having my heart-chords shredded by inexpertly-wielded plectra, I want to hear something political, or philosophical,*** or (deity-recently-disproved-by-means-of-debunking-of-oxymoronic-cliché forbid) something upbeat.  It's well nigh 4am now, so to conclude:  I shall ride along with this swell until it reaches my subjective critical mass (i.e. when the level of mediocrity and repetition is great enough to cause me to throw my stereo at the wall) at which point my tool shall penetrate deep into the moving parts of the machine (hur, hur) by boycotting the genre, and refusing to talk about it in public.  Experience teaches me that eventually, other listeners too will reach their own breaking points (a  long  time after I do) and as pressure levels change in the alternative music subclimate, cold fronts will bear down on Emo, and the winds of opinion... Christ, I really do pull some overripe flanging metaphors from my literary armpit.  It's now 04:15 GMT, though dubiously-logically-disproven-pancreator only knows what it will say on the Blog posting time.  Perhaps I should bring my, er -- freeform -- essay to a close.  (I assure you, whilst I am a "case" who is "sad" enough to stay up until this un-literarily-logically-debunked-supreme-beingly hour, as well as disproving either my existence or that of any God by some very poor logical deduction from the word "Godforsaken", and, indeed, thereafter refusing to refer to it as anything but "logically-impossible-breast-tumour" or some other such spaff, I am not "sad" enough to make this up.  I really am still up, and it really is now... 04:21 GMT.  Dawn, June 2nd)   Good morning, I'm going to bed.   ========== *(or "Apon" as Withiel would have it) **(Apon) ***(Five ducats and a Mars bar to any man who spots an essay I write which does not include the words "political" and "philosophical".  Call in now and you may also receive a Lamp Without Oil for seeking out Honest Men, or similar philosophical**** icon) ****(See?

      I wander (rather aimlessly) through Palatine dusk, and attempt to recall my middle name. There's probably a moral to all this somewhere. Meandering down a bosky avenue of fractal literary paradigms, a passing gerund tells me, allusively, that "A philosopher being a lover of truth, a man who discovers that there is no truth is no philosopher. Discuss, for a maximum of 25 marks". I pointedly ignore it, and use the aforesaid point to pare my nails, which have become rather assertive recently. Seizing a particularly buouyant clipping, I glide effortlessly through the leaf--mould of history, propelled by one hundered and theree dwarfish pseuds, each with the face of Leon Trotsky. Of course, you only have my word for this, as they're completely invisible. Before this place grey town woulden be'd.  Is the use of obfuscatorty manguage an atavistic attempt at dereification here, or is it all in truth a pack of lies? The position of a notional comma in the previous sentence will enable you to know what I mean. I'm in a loose scrubland at the moment, and my boots are brand new from Wainwrights. It's all red, unless perhaps it isn't.  Before this, there was a grey town, I ponder, before being interrupted by what appears to be a small child's concept of Margaret Thatcher, circa 1987, which is a sort of sphinxy thing with garlic-crushers for arms. In my opinion, it's marginally less alarming than the original. As if from a great distance, I hear the hollow sound of Joh Bunyan rotating rapidly in his grave. I quizzically render the beast harmless with a well-aimed teabag, climb into a waiting non-sequiteur, gun the engine with a razon smile, and by the time you've realised this sentence is far too long, you've missed the bus. Don't dismiss this as fiction, for worse, 'creative writing' (I shudder as I utter the dread words) - and I am talking to you. If I know you're readingthis, then I seem to know a future event. Which, excluding supreme egotism and phallic arrogance (Doctor Freud to the waiting room, please) means that time dsoetn ndee to be lienra.  However, if you didn't get the point of all that, then the Galactic censor or whatever (I pause to dodge a falling cliché) has got to me. I decide to write this all down on a rock, which is conveniently flat and sheltered, but can't find my pen, that is to say my bottle-green Lamy. I have other pens, but know only too well the perils of writing in cheap biro. I sigh, and walk on, pausing only to trip up a bespectacled, robed plagiarism wearing little round glasses. As it falls into an unexpected pit, I permit myself a coherent sentence. "Before this, there was a grey town, and I have no memory of the transition," I say, knowing the answer all along, but not telling for the sake of form. On the horizon I spy with my adjectiveeye what is almost certainly an eyebrow. Which is a trifle odd. Then, I find myself in bedand everything's measurable again, most disconcertingly, although not as disconcertingly as the fact that my haircut appears to be rather different than I had imagined it. Jarringly, I recall that to end a pice with the revelation that all preceding was a dream is the ultimate narrative faux-pas, and so quickly formulate some dross about a long and self-improving interior quest before flitting, Puck-like, away, clutching an item of ladies' underclothing.  Out the window, there is a grey town.

      I do not understand what is so amazing about Civilisation, or at least what we perceive it to mean. Most people would consider countries such as the UK, USA, Europe, etc, to be called “civilised”. I don’t see how. For example, in England, many of our inhabitants I would not consider civilised by a long shot. 	I have nothing against Civilisation in theory. A community of creatures, living alongside each other aiding one another when necessary, fine. But we do not do this. Our social structure is far from equal. It may be considered so by some short-sighted individuals but, by and large, I think most people recognise this to be true. However we measure social status, no-one is ever equal to anybody else. Wealth, obviously, is very important in this world, so measuring social status by this may seem sensical, but no-one is equal, save in theoretical communism (practical communism is doomed to failure, however, it’s a nice idea.). Power, this is clearly distributed in the world unevenly. Clearly dependant on what the Power is over, we all have different amounts of it none the less. Number of acquaintances clearly will vary dramatically, so this is out of the question. I cannot see what makes us all equal? Maybe human rights? No, wait, again I am mistaken. You would think that if you were attacked for no clear reason in the streets, punched for example, then you would have the right to sue for damages or something akin to that? Well I am sure some people do have this right. I think that if this happened to Tony Blair then, while many people may applaud that person, they would indeed be sued and punished. However, say I were to get punched by someone, completely unprovoked, and that person happened to be Asian, then no I would not have the right to sue them. Because then I would, you see, be being racist, and I believe that’s breaching my attacker’s human rights which are clearly more important than my own. (I do not consider myself a racist, however I dislike the way many ethnic groups will claim racism despite there not being any present and so again this is racism but against ‘white’ people.) 	So, if we are not all equal, then how is this community fair. How does this make us civilised when a swarm of bees is not? Why must we eat with a knife and fork to be considered civilised when a pack of lions need not, yet clearly their community is as good as ours, possibly better as it is not complicated further by “unwritten laws”. 	Maybe equality is not what makes us civilised. So what does? The lack of violence compared with that of the natural world. Oh no, wait a minute. I think humans are possibly the most violent creatures on the planet. Maybe it’s our intelligence? I’ve never been convinced about this argument for us being superior to animals. Is intelligence not just another attribute like strength? The Polar Bear has got it’s immense strength to survive. Humans have increased intelligence to survive, because let’s face it, if we had the intelligence of, say, apes, then we wouldn’t have got far. We would have frozen to death, or starved to death as we moved out of the Forests and it’s fruit or been killed by other animals trying to survive. Intelligence is just another means to stop us from perishing. Maybe, the fact that we can build beautiful buildings and machinery and create wonderful works of art and song that makes us civilised. Personally, I’d rather look at a tree, or a waterfall than look at ‘stunning’ architecture or ‘brilliant’ paintings, or listen to the dawn chorus or the sound of a river than listen to most of the “music” we churn out. I think I’ve figured out what it is that makes us civilised creatures and animals uncivilised. It’s the fact we have a conscience. Yes, that must be it. A conscience clearly makes such a difference with regards to making us civilised. Because, you see, the cheetahs that go out hunting on the Savannah feel no remorse for their prey after they kill them. But us humans, when we sit there in front of the television and eat our steak or sausages we feel really sorry for that poor creature that has been killed for our sustenance (no wait, we can of course survive without meat so in fact it’s not for our sustenance, it’s because it “tastes nice”.). And the bird that steals another bird’s nest, yes, they feel no remorse at all. But us humans, when we steal a car radio, or burgle someone’s house, or pickpocket someone or steal their car, we feel incredibly guilty for that, don’t we. And those humans who steal every other taxpayers money by cheating their benefit money (that’s something I don’t understand, also. Why do people who are unemployed get money when they have lots of children. If they have lots of children then they should be able to cope financially and if they can’t then it’s their own fault and maybe the children should be adopted, but there we go.) they feel incredibly guilty as they swan from their council house to the local off licence and spend it all on cheap beer before returning to their council house and sitting in front of their T.V with cable or sky or both and eat their ready meal that’s been shoved into the oven for twenty minutes and then slapped onto a plate. And those animals that go around and wipe out vast numbers of their own species, no wait, my apologies, that’s us isn’t it. Never mind. Those animals that go and wipe out vast numbers of other species, oh dear, I’ve done it again, that’s us again. I should clearly concentrate more. 	To conclude, why in the name of anything are we considered civilised when animals are not? If you can answer my question without the use of swearing or that odd language involving abbreviating everything as to make it illegible then I welcome them.

      The above is what I consider to be the most irritating and misinformed phrase ever used ever in the whole of human history ever. Apart from its "whimsical" usage by people who actually consider its simple grammatical joke amusing, it indicates an atavistic paradigm of societally counter-evolutionary nostalgia that is, in my opinion, a dangerous and unpleasant trend.  Picking up the middle section (T2, that is) of Friday's Times, I find modern "youth" described variously as "stroppy modern teenagers", "pizza-munching computer nerds", "wimps", and "weed-addled wasters". Possibly the tone of the article, reviewing a programme entitled "Bad Lads Army", is intended to be mildly ironic, but these pejorative epithets hint at the disgust heaped upon the "younger generation" (generally consisting of their own offsprings' peer groups) by the current set of (mostly) middle-aged, middle-class, and white journalists, politicians and broadcasters. This concept of the declining of the times is not a new one, and can clearly be seen in literature dating back to the Hellenic era. However, now more than ever, it is utterly erroneous and without basis in fact, and so should finally be laid to an overdue rest.  A rather telling example is that of the constant hysteria over the "sexualization" (an unpleasent neologism if I ever  heard  wrote one) of "our children". Apparently, naughty pop stars and bad men in television companies are turning our children into pint-sized whores, a phenomenon generally manifested by ever-younger children wearing tops that reveal their bellies. Generally, the "worried mother" then goes on to state that this didn't happen in her day, and a return to "conventional morality" would return her little fallen angels to a chaste state of 1950s innocence. Apart from the fact that no mention is ever made of the sexualisation of young boys (either because they are the new "weaker sex", or because the early introduction of sexual themes increases their competitive potential), these journalists, etc. seem to conveniently forget the practices of earlier (but still recent) centuries, such as the forcible marriage of girls as young as twelve to much older men, a practice that is considered totally abhorrent today. Consider, for example, that Shakespeare's Juliet is 14 years of age during the events of the play, and that this was an entirely normal state of affairs for a girl of her time. Infuriatingly, I can't find any reliable statistics for global illiteracy in 2004, but I recall that last year's Times ran a report, stating that 3% of British adults were functionally illiterate, compared to 15% of American adults. Disregarding the worrying imbalance, these figures clearly show that, in Britain at least, 97% of adults can therefore read and write. In a historical context this is astonishing and a great victory for non-Church-controlled education - the earlier the historical period, the greater the illiteracy figures, and the more people who are literate are affiliated with the Church. To appropriate another cretinous phrase, we've never had it so good. None but the most reactionary of neoconservative thinkers could possibly suggest that, to reuse the previous examples, a reduction in the forcible marriage of young girls and a vast increase in global literacy are not desirable, and therefore it would seem that any such quasi-nostalgic reversion to an earlier moral landscape would be an undeniably retrograde step for civilisation. However, it could be argued that the aforesaid Western Civilisation did in fact reach its peak in previous ages, and the morality of another decade, for example, the 1950s, might be superior to that which we have today.  Social Darwinism would seem to defeat this hypothesis, but unfortunately, Social Darwinism is one of the most unpleasant political theories I have ever had the misfortune of reading about. Nevertheless, it seems that people are generally happier and have more opportunity to flourish, in the relative cultural freedom of today, than in any other period. Perhaps I'm a pizza-munching pinko nerd, but that seems to me to be a good thing. Certainly, in the West (the only geopolitical area of which I am sufficiently qualified to speak) the current generation is mostly free from the threat of military conscription and being sent to war, the threat of virulent and incurable infectious diseases produced by poor sanitation, and much Establishment censorship of art-forms (which include journalism) has been abolished. This is not to say that we have Utopia on Earth, but that this is the closest we've got yet. It could (and has) been argued that this ease of living and flourishing has produced a decadent and weak generation, but I wonder whether "strength", as defined in this way is a good thing. Unified Germany under the Kaisers was a society obsessed with strength, and the backlash against the "decadent" Weimar government after its eventual military defeat produced the political psychosis that was National Socialism. A "strong" society may win wars, prestige and economic dominance, but has by definition to suppress many of the natural expressions of human existence. By contrast, a society that lives without the threat of war and can justify its own existence without violence allows for the development of a mentally healthy and well-developed populace. A strong argument for not returning to the days of National Service and press censorship is that these methods of strengthening a country individually dehumanise its citizens, creating what is in effect a "sick" society. Therefore, although today's "pizza-eating wimps" may not be able to survive on an all-rat diet in a trench under heavy enemy fire (and why, I ask, would anyone want to do that in the first place), but their existence is the sign of a society with a more proportionate attitude to cultural pursuits.  Or, the short version: All you bloody crypto-fascist National Service monkeys can cock right off, because all you really want to do is kill the rich cultural environment which precludes the existence of your temporal power.

      Was the slogan smeared on the swingeing protest signs of misled citizens.  Outside some sort of hop-hap or rip award ceremony.  I personally have no idea where or when, I just caught a glimpse of the foredepicted scene flashed, almost subliminally, during an Eminem music video.  It made me very angry.  Not that the director had elected to include a brief clatter of protest footage, for that was indeed a most fortuitous artistic cliché.  In spite of being one of the classical techniques of visual propagandic rhetoric (that of questioning viewers' opinions and beliefs, and inciting the feeling of self-righteous rage enjoyed by the perceivedly injusticed out-group, by juxtaposing images of the misunderstood protagonists being long-sufferingly, pathetically virtuous and generally minding their own (entirely above-deck) businesses, with contrasting images of the unreasoning "angry mob" of protesters clamouring for blood, burning crosses and screeching, "WITCH! WITCH! WITCH!"  The efficacy of this dramatic manipulation of the audience's opinions is often augmented by reinterpreting the mistreated party as tragic heroes; the unstoppable grind of the Wheels of "Justice", pulled by corrupt, aloof, right-wing judges and politicians, and the relentless battering of the all-but-buckled door by the frenzied company of witch-hunters, imbues in the viewer an overpowering empathy with these poor, misconstrued Heroes.  Furthermore, in montages such as this, the viewer is made complicit in the instinctive fear and noble sacrifice by the artist apparently addressing his audience directly through the Fourth Wall.  This is particularly powerful in televisual as opposed to theatrical presentations, because the sense of artifice is strengthened by the severe sensory limitations of the Cathode Ray Tube.  For something that is considered so patently unreal and totally divorced from the viewer's influence to suddenly transcend several levels of reality and deliver its message direct is still (in spite of its visually rhetorical cliché), subconsciously at least, attention-retentive.  The further advantage of thus addressing the audience is that the sense of artifice, and of lack of uniquity of circumstance, is not destroyed, due to the physical and psychological barrier of the television screen.  The viewer can therefore both feel complicit in the fate of the protagonists, and yet, should the artist campaign against his audience, claiming them to be fickle trendies or glory worshippers, each individual viewer can sit back and feel that he is one of the élite few who do not fall into these sweeping categorisations), it posts an uncomfortable message regarding many people's hypocritical miscomprehension of radical art.  They fail to realise that the acts of violence, hatred and dysfunxion Mr. Shady describes in his lyrics are either (a) satirical or (b) purposefully lit by pejorative lanterns.  I am no fan of "urban music", nor can I claim to be a conoisseur of this artist's work, but that Eminem which I have experienced is corrective, not promotive.  Slim Shady is subversive -- all good art should be, to whatever extent -- but  culturally  rather than  morally .  And not even particualrly culturally -- only so in the eyes of the sheltered, conservative bourgeoisie, who take offence when reminded of the alien conditions inhabited by what is underneath.  Alas, cultural unfamiliarity is too often equated with moral bankruptcy, particularly by the earning classes in this nation of mine which has been pampered by the smothering pillows of economic luxury and global social isolationism (very few Americans have a passport) for so very long.  And surely the very act of vociferous protest against thoroughly legitimate art shows a hatred far beyond any that remained trapped in the merely conceptual in Mr. Shady's music?  The educated unintelligentia have judged, and in return, they have been judged themselves.
