      We played Pook last night at Albert Park.  It was windy and cold (surprise, surprise).  We started pretty well, apart from Alex giving John a blood nose by throwing the disc in his face!  But the we faded, and they won 11-6.  I was catching way above my skill level.  There was this one that John (I think) threw.  It was about at my knee height and I was running in and I just stuck out my right hand and caught it!  I was in shock for a couple seconds before I turned around to throw it away.  Everyone was complimenting me on it after the game.  We went to John/Barrie/Liz's place after the game to have pizza, since it was Alex's last league game with us :(

      Got 8 tips this week, after sitting on 7 since the first half of the split round.  However, Vicki doesn't have her keys, so I can't collect my winnings :(  She did in fact give me a talking to because of the Advance Medicinal Exam incident.  Apparently Peter Scammels told us last year that we weren't meant to take our exams with us.  But if he had told me that, I wouldn't of taken it, so he obviously forgot (I'm trying to be gracious - but now I won't).  So, I gave all of my honours notes to Sammi to help him study, which just so happened to include the Medicinal Exam, which just so happened to be the same exam this year because those morons over at VCP were too lazy to write two exams or to even write on the front of ours that we were to leave them, like is standard procedure at Melbourne.  Bloody Monash morons.  Anyway, I'm a little riled up about this because when I went to get my winnings from Vicki she told me to come in and close the door in an ominous voice and I thought that she was going to accuse me of something much more sinister.... not that I have done anything more sinister ;p  Made lifetime membership at weight watchers today.  Don't have any good after photos yet, but  urlLink here's  a before one.

      Well, disc golf yesterday afternoon at Royal Park was very exciting.  The weather was lovely and there was no wind, perfect conditions and everyone was in good form.  I got my first par at Royal Park on the third hole (the rock one) which was very exciting, although it wasn't my first par ever because I got that on one of the holes in the back nine at Fitzroy Gardens last sunday.  Then we got to the U-turn hole, hole seven I think, and John hit the base of the sign between the two compulsories, which means you take one shot from your score, and he got an albatross at that hole.  Two holes later, at the short one where there's a choice to go left, right or through the trees, everyone got a birdie - even me, my very first birdie!  Everyone even did pretty well on the next hole, the zig zag one.  Hole 12 and its the hero hole.  I tried to play it safe but got stuck on the wrong side of the garden.  My first hammer hit a tree and fell into the garden, so I dropped a shot, but I got my second one over the garden and only got a bogie.  At this stage I was only on +11, and since my PB was +20 I was feeling pretty good at this stage.  Second last hole and I missed the lamppost so I went to take my mulligan.  At five I had go to my disc, but my foot slipped and I fell on my arse and was laughing way to hard to get back to the tee by ten, so I dropped a shot and got a double bogie on the hole.  I was still feeling good because I figured I could throw my disc in the water 4 times and still beat my personal best.  I tried to play it safe, but my throw was wayward and rolled back into the garden behind the tree of the first hole.  My next throw was as bad, rolling into the lake.  A putt that was close but not close enough, and a spot on follow up put had me on +15, beating my PB by 5!  But the honours go to Luke who got -7, beating the previous course record by 2 (I'm still dubious about Jim's -6 because he had no witnesses) and John who got -11.  Apparently Alex was a little dirty that he didn't come out and take advantage of the awseome conditions.  John couldn't come to training this morning, so he sent a message with Barrie to brag about his score :)  Along the lines of big reduction, here is the first fully published accound of my weight loss:   weight		-16.7kg  neck			-2cm  upper arms	-3.5cm  chest			-11cm (d'oh)  waist			-17cm  abdomen		-19.5cm  hips			-11cm  upper leg		-9cm  calf			-3.5cm

      Is there such a thing as a good loss?  Because if there is, that's what we had last night.  We played Grass Stains, which is Doug Liddicoat's team, and they won 9-8.  As a whole the team played ten times better this week, plus we had two new experienced players - Chuck and Stuart - who added another dimension to our team.  After the game we went to Suse's place for her Christmas in July dinner and ate some plum pudding.  I think that I have eaten too much chocolate and am in a perpetual sugar low because today and yesterday all I wanted to do was fall asleep after lunch.  Will probably play more frisbee tonight with the first begginers session and then Jamie, some of Jamie's friends and I are going to the Palace to see Franz Ferdinand.  I didn't buy a Muse ticket because I'm too broke.

      I'm teaching myself how to deal with CSS.  I really like the way it works.  We had our first training since SUG this morning and it was a poor turn out due to the horrible weather.  We were hoping that a few of the newbies would come along, but it ws just the usual crowd.  Even Liz and Rob turned up and they held hands while they were running to get a drink, it was so sweet (urgh!).  Ah, young love!  The AUG/Committee meeting was held at John's last night, althought it seemed like a lot of theorising and delegating and not many decisions.  The minutes are very entertaining though :)  We got our fundraising chocolate and I sold $5 worth to Bart a) because he thought that he wouldn't sell any so it wasn't worth him getting a box and b) I had no change and he only had fiver.  We went to throw the firsbee in the park, in the rain and Bart slipped and landed on his arse.

      I can't do any work at my bench because there are sewerage works going on downstairs and it is smelling out the whole lab.  I'm still halfway through TLCing a column I did yesterday on a big scale anion addition, that looks like it wasn't so selective because I think there is some bis addition product (although maybe not any mono addition to the wrong lactone).  I didn't finish it yesterday because it was international/mid-year orientation and I was manning the frisbee and dancesport tables.  We got a few people interested in ultimate from the UK, USA and Canada.  Hopefully a couple of them a girls who have played before who we can get to come to AUG.  Spent most of this morning running around between computers, trying to transfer and delete old spectra from the Unity300 because TK said it was nearly full.  Got rid of a load of Cuzzupe's files, but there are still a few files from Lucy, Ferdows and Yi Ming that are a little redundant.  Also wrote some instructions for those morons in my group who can't handle Unix.

      Mum got an email from Deidre saying that Uncle Arthur died on Monday morning, just after Brenda had left his bedside and while Clem was still there.Â  The funeral is on Friday, but Brenda won't be returning to Melbourne for that event even though she and Kim think they'll drive down on Thursday, so we'll probably see them some time.

      well, we did the chemical moving and it took us all of 30 minutes.  Pretty much we just moved the oxidants to a new cupboard and moved the corrosives to the oxidant cupboard, while segregating the liquid corrosives from the solid ones.  Then Steve, Shannon, Tim and Sammi had loads of fun quenching a bubbler full of black sulfuric acid and other general acidic things, including about 7 bottles of acetic anhydride.  There was so much liquid that they put a 2L conical in a crate and added solid bicarb from the spills bucket and made a volcano.  They were having loads of fun :D

      It was a major struggle to get out of bed this morning.  I haven't been able to wake up on time since returning from Geelong.  It's not like I didn't sleep enough last night.  I went straight to bed when I got home from Albert Park at about 9:30 and slept right through to 7:30.  Maybe I'm sleeping too much.  We were whipped at Div 2 last night.  We played the bottom of the ladder team, Be Afraid, and they started with only six on the field and had a maximum of seven players and they  still  beat us 15-1 (20-2 after we kept playing).  At least we had a better turn out that last week.  We had John, Barrie, Swany, Gus, Jez, Bart, Rob and Kosta and Jac, Liz, Cath and me and Suse came for support.  I made an awsome D in the second or third point and then ran on into the end zone and Bart threw the disc to me and I totally misread it.  I didn't throw a backhand all game except for dumping, but I was drilling my forehand and making some great catches.  I figured out that I shouldn't eat dinner before I go because I get a stitch, which is a massive pain because if I don't eat before hand I will be absolutely starving when I get home.  I was feeling better when I didn't get any subs after Liz pulled out with a "sore ankle" so John was making jokes about me having the build of an endurance athlete :)  I also had one other awesome cut into the endzone but the disc was out of reach and it ended up being a foul on the throw anyway.  My short cuts were pretty shit because I was to lazy to fake and the girls on the other team were really good and really fast.  They just never turned over the disc and we were being really slow to D, so that made them pretty invincible.  We have to deal with the Safety Audit today and separate all the irritants from the corrosives.  That is going to be loads of fun.  I sent an email to Lachie today advising him that I'm going to resign from the MUDC committee because I just don't have any time to supervise or even prepare for Socials anymore.  I don't think that they'll miss me cause I haven't had time for any of that stuff all year anyway :)

      I noticed last night while watching  The Block  that Jason is just like Ben!  Tried to watch Stage 14 of Le Tour de France last night, but feel asleep because I stayed too late at Alex's on Saturday night.  Which reminds me... at 2:40 on Sunday morning, John received an SMS and Jac said that she wished that she had friends at twenty to three in the morning, and I said that she did, they were just all in the room with her.  However, John's friend that messaged him at twenty to three in the morning was apparently me!  Or John or cath thinking they were funny since they were pissed.  I just think it was John trying to boost his ego :)

      Well, I must be biased or maybe I'm just shit!  Alex sent the melbourne-ultimate list a link to  urlLink Will's weblog of SUG.   He reckoned that SUGAs could have taken Silver or Gold, which is reasonable, but he also thought that they were the only team that put their girls to use.  That's such bullshit.  Not only have I never played so hard and well, but I have never had so much of the disc and so many compliments from the team.  And it wasn't just me, it was Liz and Loz as well.  Apart from the fact that we had to play savage after Suse did her ankle at the beginning of the first match against SUGAs, so we did stand in the stack a little to conserve energy, they absolutely  did not  dominate us other chicks like Will claims.  Some of the best (and sometimes easiest) D I played was against SUGAs.  I absolutely agree that Monash and BUF weren't making much use of their girls, but no girls were tougher than Loz and Liz who both played through some injuries.  I'm probably just biased, but I reckon that Will, like Andy, wasn't really watching the games so hard.  John asked TD Bart last night who he thought were the stand out tournament virgins on our team, and I was mentioned.  So I'm not shit.... but I'm still biased :p

      Brenda came down from Sydney this morning to see her (great) uncle Arthur, who is in St Vincents, so we had a catch up lunch.  Good old fashioned sandwich at Stinky Cheese was going to be followed by a cake at  urlLink Brunetti .  But on the way across Lygon we got talking about hot chocolates and I suggested we go to Max Brenner, since I actually knew where it was now cause Mum and I walked passed it yesterday on our labrynth trip to QV.   Anyway , we had to wait to order, we had to wait for a table and we had to wait  ages  for our food.  Which wasn't that good, mainly because it was cold by the time we got it.  The only good bit in the melty centre of the souffle was the hard white chocolate bit and the best thing about the hot chocolate was the fabulous ergonomic design of the "hug" cup.  The orientally design and the chocolate coloured wood around the place was pretty lush, but I don't think I'll be heading back for a while... especially on a weekend or a public holiday.  Not because it was busy, although it was, but because they charged a  10% surcharge  which is absolutely ridiculous.  Should have gone to Brunetti and put up with the burnt coffee!

      Man I'm tired.  It was Alex's birthday yesterday, and Ceels threw him a party and made loads of yummy yummy cakes.  Jac was there and she told me about Bens hypocrisy on Friday night.  He's just a moron for thinking that he's the only one in the Davies Lab who socialises outside the lab with other people in the building.  Anyway, of course it was just the frisbee people left when Ceels wanted to go to bed, so we went to Alex's place (again) for more drinking (again) and more video games (again!).  There until about 3am, but still woke up at 8, which is good because I just remembered that Brenda is down today to see Arthur and is meeting me for lunch.  Went to see  The Impressionists  yesterday and it was a little dissapointing since onyl half of the about 90 paintings were actually impressionistic, there was also pre-impressionists and post-impressionists.  The main section was great, there was loads of Monet, Renoir and Cezanne, but only a couple of van Gogh. The pre stuff was also good.  The psot stuff was symbolism and avante garde which I don't really like at all.

      {start rant} There was major conflict in the lab yesterday and I'm almost proud to say that I was an instrumental part of it.  I just ran out of patience and lost it and dragged everyone along for a ride.  Then we had a "group" meeting that invovled the members of my office and Ben, which was instigated by Ben to address all the problems in the lab.  He must be dreaming if he thinks that by just saying he would prefer it if people told him to his face their problems instead of bitching behind their backs.  Little does he reaslie that I'm spiteful enough to do it just because he told me not to.  But he is a fucking hypocrite anyhow, so that just lost him the little respect he had left in my eyes. {end rant}  Played disc golf yesterday afternoon.  Was throwing the disc with Rob beforehand and was pulling out some big throws, but of course there was no chance that I could do that when trying to play golf :)  It rained and we got soaked, then we went to Alex's for Pizza and video games.

      Kosta was itching to play since he CBF on Monday night, so the two of us went to play social league last night.  We were drafted onto the yellow team and we won 10-9.  I was feeling pretty good and I caught three in the end zone including the wining point.  I had a go handling in the cup and popping behind, but I was still throwing like shit.  Although, playing in social league for the first time in a while really showed me how much I have improved since my early days in social league.

      Well, the celebration plans kinda fissled.  Yes, Suse, I piked.  I was going to come, contrary to what I told Alex, but I fell asleep in front of the TV while Mum was watching  The Bill  and she made me go to bed.  Anyway, Al has put up some  urlLink photos  from his and John's cameras from SUG.  My usual shutterbugness was missing, cause of all the bloddy savage I was playing!

      Last nights turn out to Div 2 was appaling.  Attendees were Frank, Barrie, Cath, Jac, Loz and myself.  We also played like shit and got whipped 15-4, although I was happy to catch two in the end zone.  Frank had me handling a lot and I don't think I performed that well.  My throws under pressure are still way below standard.  I took Barrie home and since he was lonely without John or Liz, I stayed for a while and we watch High Fidelity.

      How surprised am I that Steve and my tour of Bio21 was really bad.  Okay, they have to have some credit that our lab isn't completely fitted out yet, but here is the list of everything that I can think of that is currently wrong with our new facilites.    where are we going to store silica?  where are we going to put paper, glass and sharps bins so that we don't trip over them?  are there distilled water taps?  are there phones in the labs?  why the hell are there gas taps on the benches and not in the fume hoods?  are the any vacuum lines, or are we going to have to continue using water aspirators?  apart from what Spencer thinks, are we really going to do distillations on the benches with the vapours getting evacuated down the litle pop up thing on the bench?  What about things that we need to distill under an inert atmosphere?  What about those lovely chemicals like benzene, TMSCl and triethylamine?  there is no where to put cylinders!!!  we need    storage for spares (x3)  nitrogen and argon next to fume hoods because I don't want to cannulate with syringes  oxygen and ozone generator next to the fumehood  somewhere to make dry ice    where is the waste solvent storage? (not downstairs Spencer, I don't know about you, but I don't want to have to walk down four flights of stairs every time I work up a reaction or use the rotor vaps)  First Aid and Safety    first aid kits  phones again  safety showers and eye wash stations  fire extinguishers  fire blankets  doors to many rooms to restrict fires     CHEMICAL STORAGE     2.1 flammable gas  3 flammable liquids  4.1 and 4.2 flammable solids  4.3 flammable soilds  5.1 oxidants  6 toxic, irritants, poisons  6 non-flammable solvents  8 corrosive - acids  8 corrosive  still pots  non hazordous materials  fridges for reagents  freezers for synthetic compounds    general and personal underbench glasswear storage  what is with having shelves out of reach over benches?  lighting is shit, expecially in offices.  If there is electrical points on desk, why can't there be overhead lights on desks?   At this rate we won't be in there til this time next year.  On a lighter note, I got 7 tips this week and won the week again, although I have to wait til Vicki gets back from leave to get my cash.

      In Noddy land last night Alex was telling me about Andrew's interesting comments about our  urlLink first match  at SUG.  Sure, the was a little shock when Monash beat us in the very first match of the tournament, but he neglected to mention our complete disorganisation pretty much caused the loss.  I suppose it was better in the fact that it  was  the shock that some of the more arrogant members of our team needed to realise that we are not in fact invincible :)  The  urlLink report for day two  was slightly more on the mark.  There is no doubt in my mind that our semi against Adelaide was the match of the tournament and way tougher than the final against Monash on day three.  I was very proud of the way Moho pulled together after our dissapointing loss.  We were a very tight unit by then end and I really really hope that we get enough people interested in going to perth.

      It all started with the road trip to Geelong.  Suse picked me and Loz up from Uni at 3pm.  We made our way up to Noddy Land to pick up Alex, following his SMS directions and his faith in my ability to remember where his place was after being there twice, both times in the dark and both times with someone else driving.  We got there about 3:20 and he didn't answer the door, so I rang him and he told us off for being early because he hadn't packed yet.  We were only 10 minutes early!  He finally emerged, with sustanence for the road, and we took off.  At about Maribyrnong Rd he realsied that he forgot the stereo, so we went to Suse's place and stole her housemates stereo.  We stuffed it and her eski in the boot and made our way down Geelong Road.  The trip was pretty normal, including the heavy showers around Avalon.  We arrived in Geelong and went to the bottle-o to get some beer.  We finally found it and ran into Cath in her Deakin gear while we were there.  The Deakin team were sharing a hotel with us.  We got to The Mecure and ran into Kosta, Gus, Chris and Barrie in the Foyer.  We got our keys and started lugging stuff upstairs.  Being only three girls, we were sharing one room, so me and suse had to share a bed.  We found out that our room had a door into Alex's room, so we went upstairs to Kosta's room and declared our rooms the party place.  Barrie went downstairs to sort out his sleeping arrangements because he didn't have a room assigned to him.  It turned out that they had Jeremy down instead of him, so that was all okay.  Then John and Liz arrived and we sat around waiting for Frank to get back from the Team Managers meeting so that we could go out for dinner.  It turned out that he wasn't even coming with us, so we all sat around hungry for nothing!  Dinner was a short walk around corner at Kosta's most favourite restaurant in Geelong - Top of the Town Pizza.  I just thought that there was too much ham on the pizza.  And then it was down to Eureaka for the traffic light party and my first ice cream in a very long time :)  Unfortuneately, this evening was the night that Gomez was playing in Melbourne and I was bitterly dissapointed to miss their concert, being their first visit in 18 months.  We didn't wake up as early as Alex would have liked on Tuesday.  We also had the slight problem that although John, Gus, Alex (at the physio) and I were all ready to leave on time, no one who had a car was.  And Jermey was left at the station for ages waiting for someone to come and pick him up.  We got to Deakin and there seemed to be no one on any field and we weren't exactly sure where we were playing until we saw Bart and Andrew walking along in their bright yellow accusing us of being late.  We got started in our first match against Monash just after nine, which we lost 5-8, most points going with the wind.  Lunch at the union was followed by our game with Adelaide who had just beaten Ballarat.  It was a tough game but we were much better prepared and scored a couple upwind points to win 9-5.  We lost Suse early in the match with a ankle injury, so Liz, Loz and myself had a lot of savage to look forward to.  I ranked Adelaide above Monash, even though Monash beat us, because they used their whole team, and it is pretty hard to win if you only play with four players.  That evening was the Team Melbourne Cockail Party in which we tried to eat as much finger food as possible to avoid having to pay for dinner.  We went back up to Alex and Johns room to "team bond" and the party animals went out while the old fogies went to bed.  Again we had a 9am game, this time against the fun loving BUF.  Again the wind was a big factor, but we scored enought up winders to win 11-6.  We didn't know which semi we would be playing in because it all depended on the result of the next match between Adelaide and Monash.  They played in very windy conditions while we sat in the comfort of our cars trying to predict the result.  Near the end of the match, there had been no upwind breaks so it looked like we would be playing Adelaide in the second semi.  We went back to the hotel to recover and relax before making our way back to Deakin for the second semi against Adeliade at 3pm.  It was the hardest fought match of the tournament, with both teams scoring upwind points.  At soft cap Adeliade were ahead 11-10 and the score was set at first to 12.  Amazingly we score the two points required and won the match and got into the final against Monash.  It all seems a little blurry to me now, I played a lot of ultimate yesterday.  Back to the hotel for a massaging spa bath and then out to the Frisbee Dinner.  All the other teams had way more energy than us and thought us all pikers when we were the first to leave and we went back the hotel to watch a movie and then fall into bed.  We got Starsky and Hutch on pay per view and I kept drifting while watching it.  Since Barrie had gone back to Melbourne halfway through the semi for work, Kosta offered one of the girls Barrie's bed so we wouldn't have to share, so I accepted.  We went upstairs and turned out the lights and five minutes later Barrie came back.  Kosta was feeling guilty for giving away his bed so he took all the cushions from the sofa bed and went downstairs to sleep on the floor with all the cushions down there too and Barrie took Kosta's bed.  Barrie was so excited that we won the semi and he wanted all the details, so I told him the story and by the end I was also excited and couldn't get to sleep for ages.  Today the first thing on the agenda was check out and breakfast by 10 so we got to sleep in.  I woke up at about 7:30 as usual.  The final started at 1:30pm and we made sure that we were there in plenty of time to warm up.  The final was a let down after the semi and although we were pretty even at the start, we won convincingly 15-11.  We collected our medals and drove home and now I'm off to Alex's for a celebration.

      I have spent nearly all day typing, writing and drawing my defence and my brain hurts.  I'm expecting to hear from Susan any minute to start our road trip to Geelong.  I only go 2 tips this week.  I went from first in the weekly ladder to second last.  I just went for all the wrong upsets.  I don't mind so much because I have already made my money back this year.

      Went to Cathy's today.  Finally got there after she kept ringing to change the time because of all the business she was getting.  Jack was being shy again, but he looked pretty tired.  She told me that Ness is coming down with some English friends and that they're going to drive over to Perth.  That's not my idea of fun.

      We had our last training this morning and it started out as a big bust because at 10:30 only me, Barrie and John were there and the wind was horrendous.  Jez came, then Gus with the shirts, which look really good, then Suse and about three quarters of an hour later Alex and Frank and Kosta showed up.  We couldn't do that much because of the wind, so we just did some disc handling skills and then played a little zone.  Catching was great cause the wind kept floating them, except when it was me and Frank going for the disc.  Just a little bit unfair  :)

      I'm getting in trouble again...  In May,  urlLink Steve  wrote a letter to  urlLink Ken  outlining that he had some concerns with our move to  urlLink Bio21  (and he's not the only one) and got a pretty fobbish off reply, so I took it upon myself to write to the education officer at  urlLink UMPA,   urlLink Daniel Ooi,  who I met when I went along to a student representitives meeting, outlining Steve and Kens letters.  He took a while to reply, and it wasn't so useful, but we weren't really expecting anything useful, but apparently he has been talking to people because Ken told  urlLink Mark  that some of his students were creating trouble at UMPA about Bio21, so at least Ken has realised that we're serious about getting the short end of the Bio21 stick.

      Just imagine a turkey screaching, cause that's what I sounded like (according to Danny) when I dropped my stupid flask or extremly advanced product in the stupid silicone oil bath where from it will never be retrieved.  ARGH!  So frustrating.
