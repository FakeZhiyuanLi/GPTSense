      the girl on reception has decided she likes the OTHER IT guy after he came down to fix our PC yesterday. what are we like? we had a right laugh with him and basically told him he and the other bloke were knobs for not saying hello to us as they walk past. so today i got a huge "hello" bellowed at me from him as they walked across reception.. I think the one I like is a mute (at least around women)...a sexy bloke who doesnt talk, i think i may have found "The One"!! Went to a wedding on Friday night and got slightly hammered..the reason I know this is, I was dancing to "Wake me up before you Go-Go" at 2 in the morning and i knew ALL the words. Somebody bought me a pint of Bulmers (which is a cider for those of you that dont know) so I looked every inch the classy bitch supping on me pint of cider and dancing to Wham like a woman possessed!..and I wonder why I cant get a bloke! I had to become "Sensible Lou" that night as my mate decided she wanted to sow her seeds (pre-moving in with the boyfriend jitters im guessing) so I had to stop her running down the middle of the Dual carriageway to a party with her "what-if guy"..and for a teeny drunk girl in a pair of Stilletoes, she could bloody move!! honestly, i understand where shes coming from but ive been there where you go back to see if the spark is still there and it hasnt worked out for me..in fact i ended up wanting to kill him.... so it was either rugby tackle her to the ground and see her home in a taxi, or have to go to the party with her and make sure she didnt do anything stupid. I chose the first option, although I didnt have to tackle her to the ground, just grab her arm and link her across the road. its a sad day when your friend says to you "god when did you become so bloody sensible" i think i'll book my place in the "home for the elderly" now....

      Was over the other side of the building chatting to someone and on my way back from a meeting and was heading back to my office, so i swiped myself through the door and walked straight into "hot guy" and his mate on their way home..did i smile flirtily and say "ooh skivving off early are we?" Did I heck?! I blushed profusely,smiled but barely made eye contact with the bloke I DO fancy as I giggle like a bloody schoolgirl everytime i do, so i ended up saying something stupid like "oooooh helloooooooooooooooo there!! and trying to do my best "shake my ass walk" down the corridor, but probably ended up walking more like my arse was broken!! I never walk into him! and totally wasnt expecting it, having said that..if he'd have walked into 5 minutes later I'd have had a plethora or wonderful flirty lines to throw his way..hindsight is a wonderful thing isnt it?! and whats worse is that i think the OTHER bloke thinks I fancy him because I'm always nice to him (because I'm hoping he'll go upstairs and say "that Louise is a right laugh, you should ask her out") I've been dating seriously for 6 years and I havent figured out that men arent the same as women! he more than likely goes up and says "that one downstairs has a right good pair of knockers" I really am a lost cause! had a great night last night though, met up with all my mates to make a Wedding Album for a friends wedding (we're taking pictures of her from school with songs, poems etc) we met at 7 and by half 11 we hadnt done anything and had spent the entire time laughing at pictures of us in school! I swear I couldnt breathe I was laughing so hard. I had glasses that would put Deirdre Barlow to shame! and oh, the fashions..we thought we looked the business when in fact we looked like a load of mexican refugees running across the border (with awful haircuts and runner boots with the tongues out!!). The cast of Saved by the Bell were clearly our fashion roll-models (although none of us had the wonderful baggy pants that A.C. Slater had..not for the lack of trying though! and the corkscrew perms! OH THE HORROR!!! i was fortunate enough to have a good hairdresser who wouldnt put a perm in my hair because i wasnt old enough (i thank her everyday to the roots of my poker straight hair)..instead I had to settle for curlers anytime I wanted my hair in ringlets..those bloody wormy things you wrap around your hair and have to sleep in (its like lying on a bag of spanners) so you wake up and you're in theory supposed to have a head full of wonderful bouncy(yet natural) curls. Instead, what I ended up wtih was the nickname "socket-girl"..as in, my hair looked like I had been playing with one..... Vicious bastards!

      I have decided I am to give up on men..my IT hottie has walked past 4 times today and I got a "Hey Louise", albeit a rather quiet one! He has walked past 4 times and the other times I've totally clammed up and have seen him out of the corner of my eye looking over but I reckon thats just because he was bored while waiting for the lift, and all times he's walked past I've kept my head down because I dont want to seem to eager! EAGER!! im bloody desperate!!! I'd hop over the desk and ride him all the way home if I thought he'd be up for it!

      Was driving to work this morning, laughin at a skit on the radio when i turned onto the dual carriageway..i was on the outside lane as I have to turn left at the next exit and its just easier that way (i feckin hate trying to lane change when you have limited space, it just stresses me out seeing my exit looming ever closer and panicing that no-one is letting me out and i start to have visions of myself having to do a 2Fast 2Furious stunt across the road)..so anyway I had just turned and was speeding up when i heard that god awful sound of a small car with a huge engine, favoured by little-boy-racers the world over, speeding past me on the inside lane..i was just about to do my now infamous "what an asswipe, you are and you probably have a needledick" face when i spotted it was actually my ex.(one of many, but the only one who managed to beat me to the punch of breaking up with me before i broke up with him..he treated me badly after the break up and it turned nasty) He'd gone past me at this stage but his revving only got him as far as one car up from me..but i dont know how many other blokes drive a crappy FIAT bravo and have a Cartman from south park toy in the back window so i knew it was him...and yes this was the same ex as the one who wanted the WWF mug from New York..so you see what i mean, if he hadnt broken up with me because he was cheating on me, i would have done it.theres only so many conversations you can have about a chickenwing crossface manouver!!and it did hit me as i was looking for wrestling t-shirts that maybe...just maybe he wasnt the guy for me, my only regret was spending so much money on the fucker only to have us break up a week after i came back! but anyway, i became like a woman possessed. I was cursing the L driver in front of me for doing 25 on a dual carriagway (something which pisses me off on my sunniest of days) because i wanted to speed past him without even looking and make him SUCK MY DUST! Petty? of course! for a split moment I became "Petty mc Pettyton" and i was bloody proud to be! Look at me, im an independant woman in my Ford Ka, and I dont need a man..especialy one who lists WWF as one of his hobbies! If I'd have had a Gloria Gaynor CD id have blasted him out of it! Bloody learners! i know im one of em but i dont bloody drive like one! put yer foot down and go! thats my motto!

      or Sweet F.A. which is what Ive done all day in work. Honestly, I havent done a tap of work..dont know how i get away with it, although I do get it done by the deadline which i suppose is the important part! I did manage to make abit of a tit of myself earlier though, when the bloke I have taken a shine to walked past I didnt initially see him as he was behind one of the other guys(one who always says hello) so he shouted "Hey, how are you?".. I half heartedly looked up to say hi back (hes in his 50's and married with kids so i wasnt about to waste one of my Come-hither smiles on him) only to see the object of my affection appearing behind him and loking right at me..the sound that came out of my mouth would have made Mickey Mouse sound butch, and i didnt even get to do my smile!  I then sat at the PC looking bemused and upset for about 15 minutes until they walked back the other way, i heard them coming down the hall so i prepared myself only to have the feckers walk right past!

      i dont like mondays i wanna shoo-oooo-ooo-ooo-oooo-ooot the whole.day.down.  Bloody parents came back in a wave of post-holiday depression and "ive-2-weeks-of-washing-to-do-so-the-laundrybasket-had-better-be-empty".. I had to listen to a full day of my mother telling me how annoying my father is and how all he wanted to do was watch football in the apartment(how long have they been married and she doesnt know him at all?!). My Friday evening was spent washing the floors (on my hands and knees no-less, THAT'S how good a daughter I am!)and generally cleaning the house to my mothers specifications, which go way beyond the boundries of a rational person. The house was covered in white hair (from the cat) and black hair (from the dog) so it took me 4 bloody goes round with the Dyson to clear it..then just as I had cleaned the floors and was sitting down to watch a film with a glass of wine and feeling rather chuffed with myself, the cat strolled in and coughed up several hairballs on the living room floor! I swear the little fucker smiled at me before he walked out of the room! cut to me with the marigolds out and some vanish stain remover and summer fresh "Febreeze"... Friday was not a good day for me overall.. I took the dog for a long walk in the Phoenix Park (a massive park in the centre of Dublin for those of you that dont know) as she can run herself ragged for hours without running into anyone..now in order to get there I had to drive so I let the back seats down and took that boot lid thingy off my car and she jumped in and off we went. Now, my dog likes to "go roll-ies" which means she loves rolling around in the grass! which is rather funny, bar the odd time she decides to roll in something else such as 1) dog poo 2) deer/horse poo and my personal favourite 3) a dead pigeon! I had everything crossed that we wouldnt have any nasty "rollie" related unpleasantness and was watching her like a hawk.....the bloody bitch waited until i was looking at all the deer in the park and going "oooh, awwwww so cute, etc" and proceeded to roll in a huge pile of horse poo! it all happened in slo-motion i looked back only to see her legs flailing about in the air with bits of poo flying through the air..i then shouted at her-she stopped dead and stood up, thats when i saw her head had gone from black to a lovely shade of brown. Now a rather conservative looking family chose this very moment to walk past us.. my dog started to run at me, i screamed and ran the opposite way (towards the family) but my dog sees this as a game and ran faster. now the look on the womans face as I hurtled past her children shouting "i cant believe you rolled in horse poo you knob!! I warned you about this before we left the house!! get away from me you smelly fucker!! you're so dead when we get home!" while my dog ran after me barking, was rather priceless! Im amazed she didnt report me to the park ranger! I had to spend the next half hour looking for a stream or pond to let her get into and wash herself..i was bloody knackered when we got back to the car and so was the dog it would seem, as she decided she couldnt jump into the boot of the car as she was too tired and just lay down on the ground.. cut to me struggeling to lift her without actually touching her as she now smelled of a lovely mixture of horse poo and swampy pond water(so my master plan didnt exactly work)..i cursed her from a height pretty much all the way home..

      went around a corner in 4th gear today...not my finest hour I have to admit. I think I was still half asleep..the funny thing is, instead of going down to 2nd like any sane person would have done..i made it like a personal battle between me and my Ka! So instead of going to 2nd and going along my merry way, I proceeded to keep my foot on the accelerator (and I mean I was FLOORING the bloody thing) and spent half the dual carriageway put-putting along and going about 20 mph until my car caught up with the gear I was in! You should have seen me "you wont beat me car, dont quit on me now!!!" like a bloody Vietnam war movie, half expected a battered Willam Defoe to come crawling past me with his hands in the air and that bloody Adagio for Strings playing in the background..and if he was crawling he would have been going faster that I was.. I really am a good driver normally, just not when Ive had 2 hours sleep thanks to my cat meowwing like a mangled baby because hes pushed his mouse toy under the chair in the front room and cant get it out, so I stumble blindly downstairs and get it out for him only to watch him push it right back under while im still standing there!!! little fecker!!  HeeHee Ive just remembered something I did when I was first learning to drive.. my parents had finally let me take the car to work and i was driving home one night after doing the late shift and I couldnt figure out why the car kept slowing down even with me flooring the accelerator.... may I recommend not driving home with the handbreak on!  The smell of burning when I got out of the car was sooo funny ,although at the time I was cacking my pants as my parents are very protective of their car. Honestly, ive never met a man like my dad..they went to Oz a few years ago and left my sister in charge of the car (I couldnt drive at the time-i was only 17 or so) and someone hit the side of the car,(totally not my sisters fault they pulled out of their driveway without looking) but we had to get the hubcap replaced as it cracked. The garage didnt have a match to the ones we had so we bought 4 new ones. We went to pick them up from the airport and while crossing the car park (and I shit you not, we were about 300 meters away from the car on a cloudy day), my dad bellows "why have you put new hubcaps on the car?!" I mean seriously, do they have super human powers that I'm not aware of because normally my dad cant see diddly!! Does he have some sort of weird Spidey-sense about these things?! I could just imagine him sitting in a pub in Adelaide having a laugh then standing up and shouting "SOMETHINGS HAPPENED TO THE STARLET!!" What is it about parents? One night before I flew out to Greece, I drank half a bottle of cooking wine (without realising) and nearly killed myself. I swear I have NEVER been so sick in my life, and to this day my mother (who was away at the time) believes I hoovered it up!! Yes mother, I got sick in the bath and then, instead of doing the easy thing and running the shower to clean it, i decided to get the hoover from under the stairs, struggle up the stairs with it and hoover it up, then get up the following day to wash the hoover out?! i mean, what goes on inside that womans brain I dread to think..maybe she had a mispent youth going around getting sick all over the place and hoovering it up with a hoover, doesnt mean I will though!  And we have a bloody DYSON so you can see through it! honestly, why would I do that?! Parents!.................

      ooooooh, the ex's mother said I looked "older"..I know it was 3 years ago but she made me feel like I should be wearing a turban and smoking a fag like Gloria BLOODY Swanson!... "your face looks older"...I feel positively violated! I was speechless with rage and all I could come back with was "eh, ok".. the lucky biatch caught me on an off day otherwise I'd have waved both my knockers in her face and said "yeah but at least my jubblies arent down to my knees"....so, in the words of my twin, Gloria:   I AM big, it's the PICTURES that got smaller!!

      love the fact that I can have a say in what goes on, but hate the fact that my ex's family ALWAYS operate the voting polls in my area so if i want to vote I have to run the gauntlet of my ex's mother looking at me like I ruined her precious son's ability to love and destroyed his faith in all women. She veils it thinly behind "ooh hello! how are you? on your own are you? Tony's bought a house you know"  normally I have my mother with me to spout back equally ridiculous stuff like "oooh she's is fantastic! new job, new car, no ties..is Tony not driving yet? he'd really want to get a move on!" and she normally holds me back from saying.. "why I'm, just peachy now that I've gotten away from your emotionally retarded, moody, PMS suffereing, mommas boy who throws strops that would put J-Lo to shame". Might get my mate to come with me..although she's pretty useless in these kind of situations..she sees the good in everyone and hates confrontation so she makes for an excellent friend but not the kind you want as a back up in case you have to throw an emotional punch or two! The first time I had to vote after I broke up with him there was a bloody general election the following week, (rather inconsiderate of the government I thought) so I had to go in and face him. I actually considered calling his work to tell them he was going to ring in sick to man the polling stations so he wouldnt be there! Regretted that I hadnt the minute I walked in, theres nothing like someone looking at you like they wish the plagues of the Apocolypse on you to brighten your day! Im amazed my car didnt get pelted with frogs on the way home!

      I bought a 7 euro bottle of Strawberry Schnapps in Spain and now I cant find anything to drink with it! maybe pineapple...hmmm DAMN THE SPANISH AND THEIR INSANELY CHEAP ALCOHOL!! Why can I not come home with any money from a holiday? I had 100 euros in the airport in Spain and 15 when I hit Dublin..never mind the stupidity of me deciding i just had to have 3 bottles of cheap plonk then struggling with my hand luggage and 4 duty free bags to walk the length of a small african country to the gate. they do that on purpose, you know, bet they have cameras behind the walls watching people who bought too much duty free struggling to get to the gate on time, then spend their breaks in there peeing themselves at the videos willing us to fall flat on our faces and hear the bottle smashing in the bag, thats what I'd do anyway!.. Lol, fine example of karma at work, I waswalking down 5th Avenue in New York with my sister a few years ago and saw this ultra trendy woman in a white linen suit trying to hail a taxi, not only could she not get one, she got sprayed with muddy rainwater by 3 that passed her by..i being the wonderfully understanding and caring person that I am, proceeded to piss myself laughing..then the paper bag (that I had been carrying a glass mug from the WWF store for my then boyfriend--dont ask....REALLY dont ask!!!) got so soggy from the rain, the bottom fell out and my glass smashed... moral of the story? If you're gonna piss yourself laughin at someone, make sure you have a  plastic  bag... I also lost some make-up from Sephora and some pants when the bottom of another bag burst and I walked half a block without realising as I was too busy drooling over a collection of NYFD yummies who were across the road! Paper bags are the root of all evil in this world!!!

      well back in work having had 3 days off..boo hoo!! its funny, on Saturday afternoon I remember thinking "oooh I still have 2 full days off..excellent"  next thing I knew it was Monday evening and I was doing that thing where you know you have to be up for work in the morning so you're anxious and cant relax, especially since the parents are away and I have to make sure that the house and pets are OK before I leave in the mornings..so didnt sleep too good last night..also, the bloody cat didnt come in until 12 and when he did, he had one eye closed (he had an op on his eye before xmas) I in true family style, freaked out and tried to get a look but in doing so kneeled on the kitchen floor lino but forgot Id put my body oil on so i slid halfway down the kitchen, frightened the shite out of the cat and knocked the water bowl over..had to laugh though while I was lying on my back to look up an have a one eyed cat staring into your face and giving you an inquisitive meoow is rather funny...he seems better this morning, the redness had gone down and he was opening it and he was well enough to claw the hand off me for trying to look in his eye. I asked my neighbour to keep an eye on him and gave her some food coz he will more than likely head for her house once he realises theres no-one in our house..ive never had to take insurance out on a pet before but with this cat its really the only option!! Kind of peed off at the moment...was supposed to be going to a BBQ in a mates house on Saturday (cheap option for me thanks to "margo") and was actually looking forward to it..my mate had rung me to say she was driving coz she'd had a heavy night the night before and was taking it easy and as my parents were away that suited me perfectly..was sitting on the couch, bottle of wine in hand ready to rock n roll and i got a text to say her bloke (who was travelling up from the country) had crashed his van and she was on her way down to him..coz id had a couple of glasses of wine with dinner (which ironically I never have but i thought what the hell, im not driving) so i couldnt drive to my mates and leave the car there, and i couldnt get a taxi coz it was 8 on a Saturday night..I had more chance of becoming Pope!! Now I'm not being bad and thank god he wasnt seriously hurt but the fact that it happened at the very moment she was due to pick me up (well actually she had text me to say she was running late and could we make it half 8 instead of 8) is abit of a coinky-dink...maybe I'm too cynical and to be fair I dont go out with them that often so I dont know if these accidents are regular, although the last time we all went out they had a massive row just before we were due to leave (and it was over something really stupid) they sorted it out and he met us in there. I guess I was just really lookign forward to a night out, and I felt like I let my mate who was having the BBQ down.. she didnt seem too impressed when i told her that I couldnt get down, but it was hardly my fault. I didnt tell my mate that I couldnt go if she didnt because i didnt want to lay a guilt trip on her, she sounded pretty freaked on the phone and I suppose her Saturday night was spent driving down the country... so a pooey night all round I stayed in with my 7euro peach schnapps (thank you VERY much Spanish Duty Free) and got slightly tipsy then fell up the stairs at about 3 in the morning..am officially Bridget Jones!!

      god theres some right nut-jobs on the BB forum but theres 1 in particular who has had me in stitches for the last half hour....his little song about Shell and her "flacid boiled face"  " boil in the bag nush, that is from the captains table, arg  she'll be your friend help when you call with her face the colour  of a cricket ball "  for those of you familiar with Old-skool Captain Birdseye you'll know that song and i nearly peed myself when i read it!!! I have to agree with Lemon, I'm totally loving the e-mail convos that have been happening!

      ITS FRIDAY!! ah, and i have the bliss of a bank holiday to look forward to..aswell as the parental figures are heading off to sunny spain for 2 weeks (total bastards) on saturday so I shall have the house to myself (which is good coz thanks to "margo" I have no bloody money so i can sit in and not feel like a loser for watching Casualty with my mother on saturday night)..it also means i will have the PC to myself at nights so I can log on and off to my ickle hearts content without having to hear "are you nearly finished, whats that?, are you installing something? watch for viruses!!" and then when I leave msn running and my mother is still working on the PC i get "someone called (insert name here) has logged on, do you NEED to talk to them, because Im really busy?" shouted at me from the back room. Because we only have a 14 inch moniter, i have a habit of changing the screen area to be much smaller so i dont have to scroll all the time..i keep leaving it on though so i end up getting text messages during the day in work asking me how to fix it...oh dear! Ive actually managed to convince my mother its the PC doing it, not me!  Ive made a pact with myself to take the dog for walks while my parents are gone, i actually hate bringing her out on my own...stupid gangs of kids in the park shouting "oi young one,*enter many explietives here*"  cant be arsed with all that crap, i end up shouting something equally obscene back at them and chaos ensues. Although my mates agreed to come out with me despite her fear of dogs..her exact words when i asked her were "I dont have to touch the dog do I?"  having explained the process of taking your dog for a walk to her she agreed....shes even scared of my cat for the love of god!..im thinking of getting her a Rotweiler for her birthday in June..

      i woke up thinking, nay PRAYING that today was Friday but alas no! I still have another crappy day in work. Well I shouldnt really complain as I do actually have a nice little job which I like and get paid quite well to do(when they get my wages right of course) so thats good. It's funny, I used to work in the cash office in Next so I dealt with all the cash but also payroll, so I know that the only time pay can get fecked up is if someone fecks up first. Either the employee not giving the correct details or giving them on time and thus missing the cut-off date or the payroll not entering them on time, something which never happened on my shifts I can assure you...NOT ON MY WATCH SONNY JIM! Despite me sending them my P45 three, count em, three weeks ago..they managed to not put it through so i got emergency taxed..got home, my suitcase still in the hall and opened my wage slip to find that the poxy government had taken 2 thirds of my wages..the phonecall that followed to payroll was colourful to say the least and got even more so when he tried to say it was somehow my fault and got smart with me (not a good idea asswipe, not where my wages are concerned). he told me he'd look to see if my P45 had been "processed" on time and i told him to ring me back immediately when he found out...the bloody tool even said "do you have a copy of it in case it was misplaced"  EH..NO!!!! ive never had a job lose my vital information before, forgive me for thinking that you are working in an office where people can trust you to take care of their wages..silly me, anyone would think you were a payroll department or something!?! Got a call back in 10 minutes to say they didnt seem to have it but they'd rung the tax office to get my info and it would be sorted, i would get it all back next month.. rang the tax office my arse!! i bet "margo" found it on her desk under her banana and walnut muffin, with probable coffee stains all over it, they then sat down for a minute to come up with a half beleiveable story, which is in fact bull because anyone will tell you, it takes about 3 days to get through to any civil/governemt offices and then youre transferred around until you get bored and hang up.. if its not in there on the 26th June, im getting a sock with lots of rotten spuds shoved into it and im taking me down to the payroll offices..........

      good lord im so bored..ive managed to do one thing and even that was a half assed attempt at work..thank god its a bank holiday this week!! im fighting the urge to buy a nestle double cream bar when i run out to pick my copy of Heat magazine...i shall resist though..might pick up something lighter like a kinder bueno! love kinder chocolate, ive found a supermarket that stocks the best chocolate..its one of those Aldi, Leidl shops..they really are an untapped resource, they do really cheap food(i wouldnt buy milk, bread etc there but for non perishables its great) and the wine is sooo cheap...and the vitamins are half the price (and my sis is an analytical chemist so i got her to check the vitamin value of them compared to the named brands and the only thing she could find was that the cod liver oil tablets were half the strength so just take 2)...and it works out so much cheaper. i mean i bought a Seven Seas Multibotic things with 60 tablets and it was 10 feckin euro!! whereas the same ones in Lidl for 100 tablets is 3.50!! i love the feeling of one upmanship you get when you feel like you've cheated the system by being clever and thrifty! i was rather smug after my first discovery and strolled triumphantly to my car with a spring in my step and a song in my heart!

      hate the second day back in work after a holiday more than the first day, because all the work you should have started the first day but couldnt have been arsed because you were still in the depths of "i-hate-this-country-its-so-bloody-cold-and-rainy-and-my-job-sucks-and-im-feeling-sleepy-shouldnt-have-watched-total-recall-last-night" depression, so you've actually added another day to the amount of work you have to do! wonder what i can pass on to someone else today.... reminds me of studying, you spend 3 hours "tidying" your desk, then another hour going through all your books, "highlighting" relevant facts and figures then feel all chuffed because you've worked so hard and reward yourself with a cup of tea,choccie hobnob and go down and watch Neighbours at lunchtime! You dont actually LEARN anything but you feel good and it looks great when one of your parents comes in to check on you and offer countless cups of tea.Have to admit, im a born crammer! I dont do all nighters or anything, cant be arsed with that I like my sleep too much. Study for tests during the year, then in the week off before the exams, get up at 8 every morning and work till about 6 (with obvious meal breaks etc) coz i cant study in the evening.. It works for me anyhoo. Did quite well, points wise in the old Leaving Cert. although that mainly had to do with my top grade in Honours Art.. God bless my father for giving me his arty farty gene! feck all use when looking for a job though! :D

      ok, so just found out i may not have a job by july...dont know either way which im abit worried about...basically our dept is being taken over and new management are coming in, i cant see them getting new people in as they'd have to re-train them (and while it may seem to people that i dont do a whole lot, i actually do). Actually the only reason theyre not sure is because Im so new to the company. the people who've been here a while get to stay so its just they need to find out if the same rule applies to me....fingers crossed!! First day back after the hols and its safe to say I have not done a tap! Im bloody knackered coz i couldnt sleep last night despite being utterly exausted..so i watched Total Recall in bed! lmfao at that movie! I love Arnie action movies from the 80's-early 90's...his one liners are great..although nothing beats "GET TO THE CHOOOPERRRRR" from Predator. LMAO!! Arnie always cheers me up, bless his ickle Austrian socks!

      strangely, I never finished that blog as I was mad busy with work and meant to go back to it but didnt get a chance. I feel so grown up! I bought a set of matching luggage yesterday! and they're purple!! I saw them and they were calling out to me, now all I need is somewhere to go..although I am going to Blackpool (whay-heey) in August and New York in Nov, so thats 2 trips where I can use them..thus justifying spending the money on luggage. Plus when I go to new york, my mother, sister and aunt are going too and we normally use the same bunch of luggage as we all go away seperate times, so I can see it getting abit messy when we're all fighting over who gets the "big green case with the pully thingy"..now I can sit back and watch telly while they fight it out to the death over the "big green case with the pully thingy"..i now have my own "big purple case with the pully thingy".. Blackpool should be much more fun this time..i was 14 the last time I went and was still in my "wearing nothing but black, and against anything resembling fun" phase..so it should be much better. Plus I have become alot more adventurous when it comes to rollercoasters..in that i actually get on them now (except that Big One..i aint getting on that for love of money..i dont fancy shitting myself in public strangley enough(!))

      my parents have decided in their infinate wisdom, do dig up the entire garden and replace the plants with, to quote my mother directly, "that sawdust stuff". Now my parents decided upon moving into our house some years ago, to get rid of all the grass and replace it with those little stones. They hired a rather yummy landscape gardener to do this, so I was happy. he did a great job front and back, until the plants started dying and my father decided to dig up all the plants the gardner had planted in this little circular arrangement in our back garden..so for that last 5 years, we have had a "mud-hole" in our back garden...if i ever get a camera phone I have to take a picture of it, because it really is quite mind baffelling. Especially when i get woken up on a saturday morning by the sound of my dad "tossing the mud, to keep it fresh looking"...now call me crazy but i didnt think that mud could ever be "fresh looking"..its MUD, the name kind of gives it away. Now the rest of the garden is lovely, and we have this little archway with honeysuckle which i refuse to walk under as its a haven for bees and other multi-legged things. I made the mistake of walking through it one day, and straight into a huge cobweb..the neighbours came in to check was i alright because the noise and language out of me as i ran around the garden squealing was apparently quite loud, tripping on a ball belonging to the dog didnt help as i fell over and hit the birdhouse.

      Ive decided I am going to dress my cat up as Puss in Boots from Shrek2. I can see some resistance from him at first (he's more of a tu-tu wearing cat) but i think he'll grow to love it really. He may have trouble with the talking in the Spanish accent. The bloody little shit was in a strop because all of his mouse toys had gone missing (all 12 of them!!) i reckon there's a mouse graveyard in our garden. So me being the lovely and caring cat owner that I am, drove for 30 minutes(each way) to the pet shop that sells them to buy him 2 packets so he'd stop bloody whinging. I got home and instead of being happy that I had bought him a lovely present, he decided that my HMV bag was much more interesting and proceeded to eat it!! i think he was just after the Fawlty Towers DVD's I'd just bought. The little shit has wrecked the cover of Toy Story 2!! Im so not impressed with him,and we didnt speak for several hours following the incident. he tried to win me over with a couple of "my mouse is stuck under the fridge, lady help me get it out" meeows but alas, i could not be swayed! although i was trying to watch a film and the constant meeowing was starting to grate. especially when he jumped on my bladder causing me to near wet myself..and meeowed his icky fish breath on me i had to get it for him.. cut to me lying face down on the kitchen floor with a bamboo stick wiggling it about under the fridge while the cat sits beside me with his head on the ground. i muttered "little fecker" several times which got me a few more fishy meeows. my cat honestly believes i was put on this earth to feed him, buy him stuff, rub him when he wants, and extract his toys from under furniture, oh and to clean out his litter tray...i swear he must call me "poo lady" in his head. have you ever cleaned out a litter tray with a hangover?! sweet jesus!!!!!!!

      the look on my face when the doctor asked me if I'd brought a sample of my pee with me. I didnt think I was being funny with him but on reflection my answer of "well I was going to but my mum wouldnt let me pee in her Coronation Street mug" was a little smart, especially towards a man that i was now expecting to give me drugs to make the pain in my back go away. As if I carry around a little cup with a lid on it, incase i need to give a "sample"?! he didnt look too impressed when I laughed at him calling urine "wee-wees" either. He's probably prescribed me something that'll make me grow an extra appendage or a third eye or something.

      having put it off for the last 2 weeks, I had to bite the bullet and go to the doctors about my lower back pain. I dont like being on the verge of tears because i feel like im being punched repeatedly in the kidneys, so it seemed like the only thing to do. having made my appointment, i foolishly thought that they would actually stick to the time, and I'd be in and out in about 15 minutes. Oh how wrong I was. the woman who went in before me walked into the office like she had the weight of the world on her shoulders and it too her about 3 minutes to take 4 steps into the office from the waiting room. that I could handle, until stupid mum and her spawn of satan showed up. The 2 angels (Evan and Laura-names which now bring me out in a cold sweat) started off nicely but after a few minutes, darling Laura got abit restless so decided to play with mummys keys. fair enough, as long as she keeps away from me. She did, but managed to hurl them at an old man sitting opposite. Did mummy tell her off? did she pants?! "Laura, dont throw mummys keys" not "Laura, dont throw metal objects at strangers and then laugh about it you evil little troll".. Laura then made a bee-line for my bloody wallet and tried to snatch it out of my hand..little fecker. Evan then decided to wind his sister up by getting her to scream as loud as she could, then they tried to do a tag team effort and open the door into the doctors office!(im sure the lady in there would have found it hilarious to be exposed in front of the entire waiting room). When mummy tried to get her keys back from Evan she said something like "they're my keys Evan" which he translated as "MICKEY MICKEY MICKEY" and proceeded to chant that into my face. Its so bloody hard to sit there and ignore stuff like that when its going on around you, and then have to smile at the mother when she looks at you..I gave her a sarky look and said "you must be so proud" I hope she found the sarcasm in my voice, considering inbetween us, laura was exposing herself to the room and making a squealing noise that only dolphins could hear.. and Evan was trying to pull the curtains down.
