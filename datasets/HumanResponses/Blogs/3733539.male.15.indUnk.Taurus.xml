      A question that I've always wondered is this, What is the point of human existence? Sure we've built a mass civilization, and conquered the struggle of evolutionary technology (well so we think). Of course every individual has accomplished his or her own goals, and pushed themselves beyond the realm of their abilities to succeed in their own life. But when you get right down to it, what is the point for us being here? Why were we created? Why are we the only species known to man to be able to build mass civilization, and to conquer technology? Why are we superiorly intelligent to the other creatures of this earth? Why were we the chosen inheritors of these seemingly amazing abilities? Is life really just that bland, and straight forward? No, I don't believe it is. We're living in an enigma, one in which man has not evolved enough yet to understand and be able to solve. Some people say that life has no plot. I oppose. I believe there is some reason we're here, some reason not yet known...

      Deep inside your puny mind, I have already spawned the seed of hell. You know not what you sew yourself into, soul. I shall steal it away from you, like the eagle clasps the snake, and my vengeance shall wreak havoc on your body. You will gouge out your own eyes, once you lie them upon the hideous nightmares I will cast upon you. You're limbs will no longer function as your own, instead, they will be under my command. Feel yourself bleed from the self-inflicted wounds I cause you to manifest. Your soul will escape your broken, lifeless carcass, and enter beyond the the realm of mans' thought, into the hell spawned torture I have awaiting for you. Behold, slave, I AM GOD.

      What is the truth can you looking inside your self and say you have really become a person, Out of the darkness that is everything the epidemic of confusion destruction chaos its makes me breakdown its too much what ever happen to the little thing the time when things weren't complex and disorienting. The way the present makes my life feel it masks my true emotions the words never seem right and everything is a little more complex. The future a place I can only dream now its alienated aurora it seems uplifting holy in its purity a peace I can feel and call my own.

      Its like the way thing nee era fall into the future of everything like it hates me a child of war never save  Its like a flame that burns a sentiment that warms the soul and heals the mind a unreal feeling takes ivory consuming the life that is real  Words like the world never matter insignificant kills the way we live feeling worthless, It only turns dark  Revenge is like a question only uttered by the the saint fob antiques it  re-erupts the Belgian of being hurt like a peace outside time a place I do not know where The commercialese rapes the lit of purity of the peace for the image a work of art its presence of its glory can  only be worshiped in its purity a recreation of its beauty placed to sell is only a flit of the weak What is real a thought that kills time owns the mind its Does god exist/ Why does the essence of reality kill thoughts of impurity sourly what is one isn't pure of sin  The Ideal of Sin sickness me to a bitter end Sin what is sin a sinfully act Doge something GOD would frown Avon how is this possible for mortals to contract rules to life based on a being of inexistent in matter. The Idea of sin was created my Man a fault upon it self

      Why do we search for the things that open up the deepest wounds in us, its like an uncontrolled erg to have the heart feel, Emotions as life, perplexing but yet very simple,They say that some once cannot reach there full power potential until they are pushed mentally, emotionally. Do emotions drive the deepest inferno submerged deep with in us. As the emotional limit can not be a simple thing, for achieving such power would cost so much, they say to reach such power in battle the death of a close friend, Would set a wild fire of emotional rage exponentially raising ones powers. Keep in mind the ideological point of all this. I belief it  doesn't have to be such a definite staple of fate, as that is with death. For if one have thoses he cares and loves in harms was, One will pull deep with in him, with all mights of strength, to achieve victory. For is there ever in war. Fighting man, as they often do, theses actions prove nothing, pointless violence once again ravages life. Life is such  precious thing, dangers are everywhere every day, we could die. But our emotions tie us to the present and fofill this feeling of need security, For it is the future that scars us all now, We will die it is inevitable. But do we accept it now that are time will come. Emotions carry a strong power. That each person holds with in. A limit set by laws and statistics. For determination can overcome. Pain a very interesting of topics for if your are in pain, being beaten badly by lets say 2 strong men. If there is an emotional trigger your power will rise with the help of anger. And for the pain it will be pleasantly nummed into the back of your mind still present still very real, but you have raised your tolerance with, your emotional power with in.

      Things on the outside, seem rough, harsh, dangerous, questionable even. For how can you turn your heart away from a man who refuses to loose, Winning to him not a choice a must, risking everything just to see the light of a new day, For betrayal taints the blood to a vengeance only the death of the one, can end true pain. For the black swordsman Guts, The act of war was never a second thought, but as he grows. Things change. Death always looms near. For the rivers of meaningless blood. To kill is to survive.For every swing of his giant blade a man dies. Day after day, hell in living is surviving.   urlLink     urlLink

      Life is an illusion only realized in the pit of night when everything ceases. Clarity appears of the sureality of everything. To describe, the feeling. Words them self elude the meaning. Like a dim light blaring form the incidence of the end, an ever looming truth inescapable, unavoidable, Inevitable. The world as it should turn to the cast of virture a brighter color only dreamt by the present.What is here and now seem real, but at the same momnet adept from life, like time has become careless and it begins to slip away. It cannot be stopped we must take life and realize the things that matter to us the most. Those things will restore meaning to time. The places that are no where but filled with souls  a purgatory of nothingness only to serve as a true hell for those who relish in pain. So much is undecided, so much is meaningless it  pulls on the connection we have with the world. Pulling tearing, until veins them self are severed in vain for the actions. Life is a dangerous journey, filled with pretty faces whom offer compassion  love, In truth they act as evil a facade, these tricks distance our sight of what is humanity are we one, are we indeed better than the animals we slaughter for our own heartless joy. There must be some mistake. We have lied with those accusations, only a ploy to deem our easily advanced traits a reason for the way we are. We are no better then nature. We are worse. We destroy, We kill, these things does any one ever think. To kill why. People are a sad race, believing that they must kill. Any reason is just petty in that we are mortal cant that what makes us be as one. These things sadden me why do the sub-groups of mortals have to discriminate, It seem pointless. But it is revelent everyday anywhere. There's things they done have an end. People don't see there flaws. There just cant be peace. Sure they can say we are like the animals we kill to survive. Sure. This is true. But wrong animals kill to survive. They kill for food. Its nature the cycle of life. I can only imagine if there was more to the food chain. If there was something that feeds on humans. Then the way they act would change. But sadly it wouldn't get my point across, man would only fight, finding a way to abolish the hunter. To take the food chain down one level. To feel superior doesn't mean it is earned. People have so many flaws at times I wish I was inhuman  so I could relish in the fact in not like them. The affect of possession is a tricky one that. People who care more about material things such as money. Deserve to perish. This thought will only end in a meaning less life wasted achieving what isn't truly  important.

      Every one has a story to tell the, daily life of people some how it has elapsed me,Destroying my eye to what I should see. I don't care, it breaks my heart to learn past the surface to see I am right all  along I envisioned things to somehow be this way. Is there an end for the present. My life is build upon contradictions, Wrong, Right, Truth, Lies. I cant see the difference any more. For that is what life is a mist of troubles burying in the heart of evil. The life we lead does it have any meaning any purpose for the answer is not of greater asking of as deity it is merely of our selfish as people to make something for a reason to life to love to be alive. But the way  the path of life unfolds in front of us it leads the questions deep to the heat almost as a instinct of fear for the the possible of no hope, for What if man was created for no impartial reason, just as an another ploy to elude the mind from time. An Act alone steals the minds true perception of what we call real. Life is an act we all play. Life  Is like a drug in the end, we long for more in the end and when were young and careless it is wasted and misused. aside form life outside it. Enduring is the key to living, Can man become strong enough to fight off the demons of death him self, Is a strong will the only thing to life for the will to survey a human isotonic. Enduring, living, One is only as strong as the energy they have inside for the love they have or for the hate that burns. As complex as it seems it is quite simple  Lust and Fury expand the simple things beyond the parameters we know as bonders to limit us. As only our emotions control our lives Rage is the one true feeling where so much is lost and misunderstood. Rage is vengeance emotion it can not exist with out initial pain physical  or mental. The pain wile heal over time but the betrayal, distrust . Will set the embers for a most beautiful Fire a in contrariwise  fury of the heart and body. It will grow, feeding waiting till the time is right. The sweet Inferno will reek havoc giving the power of heart.something seem to break the normality to life, the past, time you've spent, and the memories of the days. These things makes us feel good about our self, gives us some self worth and meaning, The people that we've lost on the this journey of life im in pain because of the ones who are so far things seen to work out but as life it is just a facade. Things of my past, the people the place the time it is all some thing I wish I could do all again. Lost hope that is.I end with a quote "For the power you can not see hides within the soul the flame of your existence"

      There is always something deep inside of us. Something powerful, Something as radiant as the sun. For the days of life never ending in the mist of failure. Life is a feeling. With many obstructer and complex systems to why any of it is the way we see it. For life in the eyes of an average man sees nothing he never questions his life. Never stopping from his meaning less quest for fame and fortune. For that very reason I hate the ideal of celebrity. These people think there better than everyone else just because they have money. These things seem so petty I am my eyes. For I see the human in it all. These people who think there better than the rest are no better by any means. In fact if anything there are weaker than the rest. They are afraid . Afraid that we would steal there fortune. Take there money and leave them just like us. My thoughts simple in there smug complexity. Human is mortal. Flesh, bones, blood, We all have what makes us human. Ones thoughts of superiority are a indication of inferiority. We are all the fucking same. Why don't they understand. A bullet will rip through any ones fucking head. No exception's. Fame, money. What does it matter when your life has ended. Does it fofill your soul to know you have wasted your life collecting objects of life, without actually living life. What drives us to see the answer. To not give up to feel broken. Yet start what you don't understated. For the cause, life is full of they riddles we start but do we ever finish them? Ironic really a riddle to question the riddles. Pain gives life new meaning. It makes us have an understanding of place. To know of the end as life pains our mortal soul to comprehend what to will be after. The lust for power is a devilish wish upon the world it has cursed. Why do I never know the answer lying in the emotion crying inside my soul its tears cause me pain. I feel I will never find an answer. This meaning less void human is. Can we be a part of some grater plan are we a key to the secrets. The ideals are a truly optimistic and blissful dream. When you at humanity that waste of life the mass of the world has corrupted it self to be. That being something of a higher plan if only a narcotic hope. Is there salvage for what it was to be human or has corruption poisoned us all. Days pass, Nothing happens the mind can only cry out in pain for the torment of existence. That fills life. Why cant I be happy with living life. Content, to just feel anything would be enough, so cold am I life has frozen the things I thought I could belief, now and forever my words will tear a hole deep in the heart of the feeling in life. Tears of the soul will never heal. Blood will rain from its pain life will not have meaning. The Masses that is the world. Sickness me. The fact of its infatuation alone a distastefully enjoyment. Of total incompetence with power. Fuck life is complicated when will it end.
