						   Lydia, oh Lydia; have you met Lydia? Lydia the tatooed lady.  Homework is yet to be done. This post only exists to remind myself I have a blog that still exists and 'needs' regular updating. After having several blogs on rival websites that have failed miserably, I feel I should start with something on the site that more or less started it all.  May start transferring thoughts online. These have already been compiled with papier mache and twigs in the garden shed, and simply need a lick of paint before they are released on the world.   They will be stolen. This frightens me. Well, at least I'm the only person aware of this page thus far. This makes me joyous.

						   As the tennis ball howls at the moon, an elderly teenager sits at his laptop, considering starting the English homework he should have done last week. Alas, it has not been done; it will be put off until the very last minute like everything else this year.  He has joined the mob, jumped onto the bandwagon. He is now a blogger. What the hell is he doing?  He is  Daxiel Kahnsworth  and requests that anyone reading this portion of faeces does not judge him too harshly on the disgusting mediocrity of this first entry. Why does he care about approval from faceless online entities? The answer will not come with time.

						   Well, as expected, the matinee yesterday went pretty crap. The crowd was composed of the usual suspects; old people and primary school children. The elderly members of the audience either didn't hear or understand the jokes, and the primary school children left halfway between Act Two. More than a slight debacle, but we kept going through it all and survived. My microphone was falling off my head consistently through most of the songs I sing, especially giving me trouble through the choreography. It's bad enough to wear Madonna-style microphone headsets, but if they don't perform their intended function, it goes beyond a joke.  Tonight all was amended. The microphone no longer sucked because the tech crew worked out how they are meant to sit on your head. After I got over the embarassment of finding I was wearing the thing in entirely the wrong fashion, I was intensely relieved that I could relax on stage without fear the microphone was about to eat my face or fall on the floor. The crowd was pumped, laughed at all the right places and enjoyed the bits I love performing. I'm truly having an awesome time.  The surreal nature of time's behaviour when one is on stage goes beyond explanation. Time simply races, and the whole experience is entirely out-of-body goodness. I will miss  Hot Mikado  by the time Friday night comes, but having my life back is something I will not take for granted!   Homework I have not done because of  Hot Mikado  and blog:    Preparation for English Creative Response SAC on  The Quiet American   Maths sheet  Public speaking preparation (more on this later)   Well, that's it for now. The mundane rubbish about homework was posted because only I read the blog at this stage.   If you come back and read this, if the foolish idea of advertising my nonsensical ramble to the world occurs, do not blame me, for you were not meant to read this. It is your own fault and I shall hear no complaints.  Hail Mary full of grace, help me find a parking space. I'm not Catholic.

						    Hot Mikado  dress rehearsal today went totally shit. I'm shit. The chorus is shit. The microphones are shit. It's all shit and that's the way it will probably stay until Friday night when we will put on a powerhouse mediocre performance to end a shitty run of shitty shit.  Those worries discussed in 'The butterflies attack' were not without reason. I shall write again after the matinee, simply to tell you how poorly it went. Hmm. Argh.

						   Is it worse to be the man who intentionally isolates himself from others by pretending he is weird, or the man who is unconscious of his weirdness and wonders why he remains distant from the world?  This week, Kahnsworth appears in an 'academic' version of a disgusting bastardisation of Gilbert and Sullivan's  The Mikado . Named  Hot Mikado , its world is a suprising accurate caricature of Japan today. The main Japanese elements remain, but all else has been replaced with American features - accents, clothing, all reminiscent of 1940s America.   The nervousness would be easy to deal with if I could actually justify my involvement in the musical. I am continuously ambivalent about my part in it, consistently revising why I choose to be in it in the first place, and why I continued my involvement to the very end.  It is a school musical, so the bar is not raised very high. I want to exceed the bar, impress all, a triumph of form and meaning. I love chucking that in writings all the time, because it sounds like I know something about art.  Is my entire personality a facade? Although at times the answer would certainly be yes, no, no it isn't.  The people I have met and got to know through the musical are superb. But have I actually gotten to know any of them? Continuous superficial conversations on my part have led to my knowing I can talk shit with many people, but not many new friends. The amount of friends I have at the moment is not alarming at all; I am happy, I have several.   But, as the adage from  Full House  goes: "Friends are like jello, you can never have too much."  So it's either poor grammar or poor semantics if you are to quote  Full House  correctly. Oh dear. How American. Nevermind.   Post Script:  Eric Bana has been announced as the new James Bond by  News of the World , an exceedingly unreliable tabloid. It would be extremely interesting if it is true, but I will continue to doubt the reliability of this information until I see Bana in the next Bond film.   Why, when I write 'Bond', do I consistently make a typographical error and write 'Bong'? I'm not addicted to marijuana... yet.
