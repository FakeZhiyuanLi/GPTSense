        wow... working 12-7 really sux. i came home pretty agravated.. but what can you do when you need serious money for a new car because the one you have is a piece of shit? Yea. Not too much, huh. So that was pretty much the extent of my day.        i guess i'll give props to my one and only sis tonite. it's amazing how well we get along lately. it's almost strange how we like never fight anymore. Once in a blue moon. I think shes grown up alot. Although there still is a LITTLE more maturing nessesary...;) it's nice because when all else fails, i got my bud rite here in the house to go out n do somethin with.. lol.. no im j/p.. i'd hang out with you even if i  could  have plans. it's always fun to come up with new nicknames for her too.. but out of kindness to her, i will not put those in here.. lol... But yea.. B-rit's not too shabby anymore.. she's quite cool if i must say... ilu, sis.. muah.       So waht is there to really write about in ur blog when you've had a boring week like i've had?   and it doesnt look any better either. o well... How bout i say what this blog is really all about? waht's on my mind... this summer is not meant for romance. And i am perfectly content with that.. but god damn, people... what he hell? I def need SOME action soon! i mean, am i  that much of a loser?  i think i need to start looking elsewhere besides litlle old ponaganset high school for  some real men, who are actually mature enough for me. You guys need to get in shape, and i think many of my fellow gals will agree with me... am i right ladies? it's true! but this upcoming year has to do somethin for me. i def need some kinda lovin'. ;) i', here, and i'mready, but only if you are...       And thats that. For now. But believe you me, i have pllllentyyyy of thoughts on the questionable behavior of high schoolers... it really makes me laugh.. haaa... untill next time, my friends... adios...

        Oh, my gawd, is all i can say. You people definately need to get on over to my house and watch a movie with me. We just bought a 600 watt home surround theater system, a $1400 HD TV, 36 inch, and a new entertainment center.  WOW . You can seriously feel the movie under your feet. It is sooo awesome. I am just amazed. lol. No, seriously.. it's that great.. you gotta come over.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Well, seeing as how im in such a good mood tonite, i think its time for shout outs to my peeps. :). Since i told Jeans she would be in tonite, i guess she's first. (Not that order matters or anything. cough cough.  ERIN . cough.) Jeanine Luther is my girl. Yo ucan really talk to that girl about anything, and always count on her. Not to mention that shesso much fun to be with. She's wicked hott, and loveesss to laugh.. taht girl can brighten up your day... and when shes sad.. o god.. its painful. :( i hate it. And ya know, this summer she has benn thru a few changes. It's true. But ya know, i think i love her even more. shes breaking out, havin some fun. i dont care what she does,  i'll always love jeans,  and she will NEVER be able to get away from me!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erin Blanchette. Well, what is there to say? Y'all know how much i love this girl. She knows all my dirty secrets, and i know all hers. ;) She's so cute, even tho she can be such a girly girl (although she'll NEVER admit it...) I can never get enough of her, but you know that. Is there ever a day that we are NOT together? It's almost hard to remeber the last time. lol. We're jus so comfortable together. We can go over eachothers' houses and feel rite at home. Whatever we do we have a blast, even if its absolutely nothing. Like stalking ppl, because we just felt like it.&nbsp; I have soooo many awesome memories with this girl. i don't know what i'd do without her, but i do know that we are going to be bestt friends... FORVER... I dont even think   Chad&nbsp;   could break us up! Well.. hmmmm... lol&nbsp; :)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Brianna-freakin-Landry! You spend one minute with this girl, and you'll keel over laughin!   this loser cracks me up! no, this girl is hott. one of the smartest girls i know, so easy to talk to about real stuff, but brie.. where do u come up with some of the shit you say? I mean come on girl..., you havent been a blonde for quite some time now! lol. this girl is the life of the party... really... lol. I always have fun with this girl, and i know that she's always there when you really need her. That's why ill always be there when she needs me. Cuz our little gang, we stick together for LIFE, rite giys? even if we repel some people.. lol...ilu girl.. :)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's weird, but that is my gang. The girls i see almost every day, and could not live without. But that does not mean i'd forget my other lovers.  Jen Smith  rocks my world, but where the hell have you been, girl?&nbsp; i miss my jenny- poo!You NEED to call me up, hoebag...lol.. that's love rite there... and of course, i could live without my men...  Andy Constant , i love you kid... you know im always here for ya.. but.. i dont love you enough to not up my rates.. it's now&nbsp;$400 an hour buddy.. sorry.. lol;).. lets see.. my party boys,  hawkes, lynch, donahue .. you guys light up my life.. ;) and show me them move,&nbsp;PHIL SPARKS! ow owww!

         There are sometimes when i just feel like my life really sucks. I mean.. why do i try? Where the hell does it get me? Nothing i ever imagine goes right, and i always get let down.  I dont think that i am so priveleged that everyting should go my way, but wtf! I actually try! I fuckin work hard, and do what needs to get done! I cant explain why i feel this way so much, or why sometimes i really cant stand being me, or why one way or another, i always end up  feeling like others cant stand me either. Theres always somone or something better, right? I guess you probably think even less of me for being so seemingly selfish, uptight, and miserable, but  it jus seems like everythings wrong. Sometimes i dont  even know why. I jus feel horrible. But thats what blogs are for right? So people can know whats goin on in eachothers' lives? Well now you know. Yup. this is Ashley, fuckin Barry! Who cant seem to get over the fact that she lacks the ability to impress, and is sometimes completely miserable! theres so much more to say, given the fact that i psycho-analyze myself all the time, but there arent enought pages or earsin the world to take in all of my thoughts. sorry abot the babling, but i needed to get it out. and im sure im not the only one whose felt this way. and that just makes it worse.i just cant wait till my life is actually completely in my own hands. because in the end, I am the only one i can truly depend on.

We were only there for like 2-3 hours and could not wait to go home.. lol   i didnt get burnt... that was a good thing.. actually, i did alittle bit, b/c i drove, and on the way up, the sun was beating on my left arm... but thats ok.so that nite was fun, especially the shopping i did afterwards..;). Last nite i went over erins and watched "You got Served". Good movie. SOMEEE hot guys, but not alot.. lol. Then bire and erin just poped in on me at home later , and we went to try and stalk ppl, but no one was around. The nite dint alst long, b/c erin remembered taht the finlae of outback jack was on, so we had to go home.. lol...;) who watches that stuff??? lol. but yea. today i ahve the day off, and im realxin.. cleanin up my room, laundry, workout, then watchin to tenn choice awards, tonite at 8 on fox 11.. make sure you watch too! lol.... k, well this ketchup is gone, because the bottle was pretty empty anyway...lol.. yea i know im a dork...

        tonite we were all together.. the gang.. me , brie, erin and jeans... we  triedddd  to get the guys to come, but it just so happens that they have lives, and we could not get ahold of them to save our lives.. lol. so, we went out to dinner together.. girls nite out.. rite?? lol. anyway. we went to chili's for dinner, and to our pleasant surprise, Brandon Ruotolo was a waiter there! oh. my. god. just in case you were wondering, yes. he is stilll drop dead gorgeous. probly even hotter. so you def need to go eat at chili's sometime.lol. they probably all thought we were weird after we left tho, huh? the place was pretty messy after the rice war we had with brie's leftovers... hhaaahaa. ;). then, in the parking lot, these three guys musta thought we were even weirder , when after pushing brie out the door, erin proceeded to attack her, and threatened to punch her in the boob... (this is NOT a dramatization, btw.... ;)...) anyway, after sweating out asses off in my piece of crap car, we went to blockbuster and got  the butterfly effect , and  true confesions of a teenage   drama queen . we ended up coming back home and watchin them with my grandparents and my 2 little cousins... fun fun, rite? lol . yea. but now, i think im getting a cold, and i have to work early tom morning, so im off to bed.. but... ill leave you with this....     Quote of the night: " Oh, i   love     fat kids!...    Gay      fat kids!"..   lol .   guess you had to be there...:)

        Today is August 1st.   Wow. We only have 4 weeks left of Summer. Where did it go? It's time to make the best of the rest. lol. mhhhmmm. Feelin' a little stressed lately. havent really even started my summer reading. Given no thought as to what i want to do with the rest of my life, or where i wanna go to college. Wherever i do decide to go wont be good enough for my fam. For some reason they all think im some genious and that im going to get into like, Brown University with a scholarship.. haha. YEA RITE! step into reality, here. Guess i'm gonna be a big disapointment, huh? Oh well. I'm used to it. so.  anyyyway ....i've definately been pretty bored lately. The first half of the summer i dont think there was one nite i was jus in the house all nite.   Lately, its been like.. everyyy nite.. wtf? Let's keep the good times rollin!   Ya know what the problem is? There is nothing to do in this freakin town! I've already seen like every movie there is out there, and done a little TOO much shopping... really.. what else is there to do? There should be a party EVERY NITE! then i'd have a very fulfulling summer.. we all would! lol.. well.. not much else to say.. and besides. im really busy doing nothing rite now.. so.. bye for now! ;)
