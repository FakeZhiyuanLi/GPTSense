       hey my teacher gave us this article about security cameras in the uk and he asked us to post up our answers to a few questions so here it is:   1.How does the increasing use of cameras affect privacy?  Everywhere we go, everything we do, somebody’s watching us. Now I don’t know about you but that makes me feel uncomfortable. Say you’re in a department store and you scratch your butt. That’s not all bad but it is embarrassing. But what about you reveal something about yourself to someone you trust. Something deep and dark. Something only meant for your ears and that friend. And there’s a surveillance camera taping it. Now that is wrong.   2.Where do you think it is fair to have cameras installed? Not fair?  It’s fair to install cameras in banks, malls, big public places, anywhere that’s not private. It’s not fair to have cameras installed in a private residence against the owner’s will.    3.What is your opinion on this subject?  Hey I think it’s good that they’re doing this. Just as long as they don’t install cameras in a private residence against the owner’s will.   4.If you feel that this is an invasion of privacy, how do you feel governments should help increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats?  I don’t think that this is an invasion of privacy so much as it is protection. Like I said, just as long as they don’t install cameras in private residences against the owner’s will.   enjoy (i think) :-S

       hey this is chance again. the weekend was too short. our former english / social studies teacher, Ms. Hall, is here for a week. shes really nice. thinks shes j'lo. BTW sad that it didnt work out for Bennifer. speaking of break ups  it was really sad it didnt work for Britney and Justin. although i hate the guy. but in a way i think it was for the best because it was only after the breakup that Britney started re-inventing herself. i dont know why im saying that in some way it was for the best because i think that they're going to get back together again. (shrugs) well i guess that's just me. i'll continue with this later. my computer teacher wants us (the class) to do something. BTW he's a really cool guy.

       Hey wassup?  Havn't updated in a while. Not like anybody but me reads these postings. Maybe my computer teacher and my friend Karen who's sitting next to me but that's about it. We have parent teacher confrence today so we get out at noon. My mom's meeting my sister's teachers and my teachers. We're both good students so we should get a good report from the teachers. Unlike our brother who is turning out to be quite the dilinquent. But since he's only five there's still plenty of time to improve. Oh by the way, I'm starting guitar lessons today. I'm pretty excited about it. You know what? I think I'll make this like an online diary where I update every week. Yeah it works for me. And besides I don't think anybody reads this besides me.  later  Chance

       hey my teacher gave me an article to read and some questions to answer along with it. he then asked me to post it up. here it is:   1.Do you feel this would be something you would like to use?  No I would not like to use this because it’s a really new thing and I’m not exactly sure how it will work out. I’d like to monitor this a little further. If I like what I see, I might consider it but if I don’t like what I see then I’ll just forget about it.    2.Do you think society is ready for technology like this?  It actually depends on the individual. There are some who will just say no. There are some like me who want to monitor the situation. And then there are the people who become the guinea pigs; by choice of course.   3.What would be the benefits of this technology?  It would be really hard for someone to steal your credit card. In order to do so, they would either have to kill you or amputate your arm. And even by doing so, the Biochemical tests can tell weather you’re dead or alive or in trauma or not.    4.What could become problems with this technology?  There might be a malfunction and the chip could emit a deadly virus throughout your body that would kill you within seconds. The point is that this technology is new and god knows what could go wrong with it. Which is why I choose to monitor the situation.    5. What other thoughts or opinions do you have regarding this technology?  No I do not have any other thoughts or opinions regarding this technology.

       Hey y'all! Havn't updated in a while, not like anyone besides me reads these things. Went on a camping trip with my class. I didn't enjoy it 100% but I dont regret it. Except for the fact that I missed the premiere of Britney Spears's new video on TRL and my dad forgot to tape it. More later.  Chance
