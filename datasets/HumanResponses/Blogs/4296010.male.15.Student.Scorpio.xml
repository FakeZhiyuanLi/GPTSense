      *sings " Just Like You "* I could be mean I could be angry You know I could be just like you You thought you were standing beside me You were only in my way You're wrong if you think that I'll be Just like you You thought you were there to guide me You were only in my way You're wrong if you think that I'll be Just like you I could be cold I could be ruthless You know I could be just like you I could be weak I could be senseless You know I could be just like you You thought you were standing beside me You were only in my way You're wrong if you think that I'll be just Like you You thought you were there to guide me You were only in my way You're wrong if you think that I'll be Just like you On my own, cause I can't take living with you I'm alone, so I won't turn out like You want me to. *sings " I Hate Everything About You "* Every time we lie awake After every hit we take Every feeling that I get But I haven't missed you yet Every roommate kept awake By every sigh and scream we make All the feelings that I get But I still don't miss you yet Only when I stop to think about it... I hate everything about you Why do I love you Every time we lie awake After every hit we take Every feeling that I get But I haven't missed you yet Only when I stop to think about it... I hate everything about you Why do I love you Only when I stop to think About you, I know Only when you stop to think About me, do you know I hate everything about you Why do I love you You hate everything about me...why do you love me? *sings " Home "* I'll be coming home Just to be alone Cause I know you're not there And I know that you don't care I can hardly wait to leave this place No matter how hard I try You're never satisfied This is not a home I think I'm better off alone You always disappear Even when you're here This is not my home I think I'm better off alone Home, this house is not a home By the time you come home I'm already stoned You turn off the tv And you scream at me I can hardly wait until you get off my case No matter how hard I try You're never satisfied This is not a home I think I'm better off alone You always disappear Even when you're here This is not my home I think I'm better off alone Home, this house is not a home This house is not a home I'm better off alone *finishes singing all these wonderful songs by 3 Days Grace and my hands hurt like heck from all the typing* *yawns* I'm very tired, I think ill sleep soon. That way I can wake up early and go and buy 3 Days Grace's CD in the morn and have these wonderful songs. Well nighty all.

      At the moment.... I'm sitting in my room, listening to a wonderful band by the name of 3 Days Grace. I'm staring at this screen as I type. All the time wondering why I'm typing all this. Now I begin to sing the lyrics, thou I don't dare raise my voice to high, in fear of alerting my mother. Hm the funny thing is I have no idea why I'm typing this now. I suppose I'm just bored, or out of my mind. Either way I'm fine with that. I do belive I'm going to silence myself now.  *Softly sings the lyrics to this song*
