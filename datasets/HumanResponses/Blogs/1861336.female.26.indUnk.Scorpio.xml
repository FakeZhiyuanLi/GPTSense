       Read this.    urlLink The Passion of the Major League Baseball Preview .  Good preview, and funny as hell.  (Except for the part where he predicts Oakland to beat Boston in the ALCS.) Yanks lose the first game of the year to the Devil Rays.  I was actually considering staying up to watch this game but then came to the realization that just because I'm starved for regular season MLB doesn't mean I have to do something crazy like watch a Yankees game.  Come on Sunday!

       Six more days!  Pokey Reese is getting some positive press today.  Jack McKeon  urlLink says  this:  "If he hits .260, that's good.  He'll save you 40-50 runs a year.  If he knocks in 35 runs, tack them on and say he knocked in 85."   If I were King of the World (I guess it would be Queen or Empress, since I'm a chick,) Pokey Reese would be the starting shortstop of the 2005 Boston Red Sox.  My husband is on this kick lately about how the Sox should get  urlLink Deivi Cruz , who was recently released by the Devil Rays, to play at second base while Pokey takes over shortstop.  This would be a highly economical move and would make the keystone very solid, but we would be losing too much run production, IMO.   Neither Cruz nor Reese are any great shakes at the plate.  Pokey Reese has said that he'll play wherever his team wants him to play, but he also said  urlLink this : "...a lot of people consider me a 2nd baseman, but I consider myself both (2nd and SS.)  I've been looking for a home for a long time, and what better place is there to play than Boston?"   Indeed... Kevin Millar is back at it with his new  urlLink diary .  Couldn't they have picked someone else to do it this year?  Ortiz, maybe?  Pokey?  Varitek?  Schilling?  Maybe they could do Pedro's monthly diary, and we'd all get to read 6 paragraph diatribes about how everyone hates him because he is black and Dominican.  I used to really like Millar, but I got kinda put off by the whole A-Rod, ESPN interview thing.  Maybe the best thing for him would be to pull a Leonard Cohen and take a vow of silence in a buddhist monastery for a year. There's some activity on  urlLink Manny's website .  That picture on the right - yikes! - looks like someone got into Pedro's jerricurl juice.

       We were just watching  this show on ESPN about spring training and the upcoming season, and Todd Walker was on there saying "I definitely believe in Boston's curse, but not so much in Chicago's."  That is what we in Over the Rhine call good, old-fashioned haterism. Penny of the Florida Marlins shut out the Sox today, with Lowe giving up 3 runs and 4 hits in 7 innings of work.  Final score was 4-0. Nomar will most likely  urlLink miss  opening day in Baltimore and may be out all the way until April 10th if he is put on the DL to start the season.  Trot Nixon is headed to a spinal center to continue  urlLink rehabbing  his back.  Apparently he is making good progress and is still on pace to return in the beginning of May. Only one more week until Opening Day!!! Oh, one more thing.  There is a small fraction of Sox fans who have been calling David Ortiz "Ortizzle."  This drives me crazy.  Let me just take a moment and explain how incorrect that is.  There are three major suffixes in slangy rap star speak:  -izzle, -eezy and -iggity.  You conjugate words into rap star-speak based on the sound of the word's last syllable.  "Shit" would translate to "shizzle," while "sheet" would translate to "sheezy."  Which is why "Ortizzle" is so fucking wrong, and obviously the brainchild of some person posessing a crippling amount of dorky whiteness.  It should be Orteezy.  Okay.  I'm done.  My soul is unburdened.  For more help with rap star slang, visit  urlLink Tha Shizzolator .

       I couldn't make this shit up.   If you don't know me in personal life, I'm one of two fish cooks at a five star French restaurant here in Cincinnati.  It's pretty upscale, as you can imagine - a very elegant dining room, very attentive service, all that.  In addition to the dining room, we also have two large rooms on the second floor which people can buy-out for the purpose of having us cater a party to them on the premises.  We do about 4-5 of these parties a week, on average.  Last night we had a party for 40 people upstairs.  They're getting a four course meal, with the course off of fish station being the scallop appetizer - nothing unusual.  Except for the fact that the dinner is to be served in  complete darkness , with the servers all wearing  nightvision goggles .   I'm not lying, so help me God.  I ran upstairs to the party room as soon as I heard about this shit, and sure enough, there's a server walking out of the party room looking like Jame Gumb in "Silence of the Lambs," only wearing a tuxedo.  Un-fucking-believable.  It was some kind of dating service that hosts dinner parties in the dark, that's their gimmick.  But talk about bizarre.  I've never seen anything like that before in my life.  I put the nightvision goggles on, it was pretty cool.  It made me want to put on a woman suit and chase Jodi Foster around the restaurant with a .45 magnum. In baseball news, Sox beat the Pirates 5-1, with Arroyo throwing 72 pitches in 6 innings,  1 ER, 4 Ks.

       Woah woah woah, people.   Let's all just calm down about the  urlLink Pedro's fastball  controversy.  It's starting to get old.  We won't know exactly what he's capable of until the regular season starts, and furthermore, I honestly do not care whether the man throws a single fastball over 91mph for the rest of his life as long as he keeps getting wins.  I understand that there is more involved in this issue than just whether or not Pedro can throw 97mph anymore.  He is in the last year of his contract and the Sox management are trying to figure out if he's durable enough for a long term contract and all that.   But the Sox are taking care of business.  Shaughnessy, in his latest  urlLink article , quoted Larry Lucchino as saying: "Ordinarily you like to diversify your portfolio so that player's contracts don't all come up at the same time.  Due to an unfortunate confluence of events, we are making some exceptions to our general policy about no negotiating during the season...we're not on a stopwatch.  We're not trying to get things done in the next 6 days."   I would venture to speculate that having so many contracts to deal with isn't the only reason why the Sox are going to take their time deciding on a contract offer for Pedro...They probably want to see him in action over time during the regular season before they make a judgement on his value.  I think we should all follow their lead and just chill out with the spring training panic bullshit. Incidentally, I can't believe I quoted a Dan Shaughnessy article today, but believe it or not it's not as outright offensive as most of his drivel is.  Usually I want to bash Shaughnessy in the brainstem with a rusty anchor, but not today.  Perhaps he realizes that if Pedro leaves town he will have to invest too much time ruining another player's reputation and inventing catty things about them to write about.  Or perhaps, as I have always suspected, his overbearing negativity and constant personal attacks on Pedro are really indicative of deeply repressed homosexual desire.  [Haha, I can't even write this with a straight face.]  Sort of like how kids in third grade pick on the little girls they like the most - that kind of vibe.  Hey Danny, I can't blame you kid - Pedro does have a hot bod and a butt that looks tighter than bed sheets on an army bunk, but I think you're going about things the wrong way.  Just ask the man out and spare me all the shitty "journalism."

       I'm one of those people  that talk/yell at the television.  Even if I'm just watching Law and Order or whatever and one of the suspects says something stupid to Lenny Briscoe, I'll be like "Boy, this dumb bitch is going down!"  Fortunately, I hardly ever watch regular television.  But during the summer when we're watching baseball games every night, my tv-yelling becomes nearly an art form.  Just ask my husband.   He's the quiet type (further proof that opposites attract,) and is happy just throwing his Sox hat at the tv screen.  Not me.  Although I also throw my hat, it's usually accompanied by something like "(player name), you (expletive) moron, I've seen rigor-mortised corpses make better plays at (position) than you!"  (Fill in the blanks.)  But don't think I'm always ranting and raving - I also cheer a lot, too.  You know, encouraging guys at the plate to get a hit or extoling whomever is on the mound to strike this POS SOB out, etc.   But the bottom line is that all this yelling and talking at the television has caused me and those close to me to develop a lot of nicknames for Sox players.   Some are pretty obvious, some are kind of arcane and involve inside jokes, but I love them all and I'm going to post them because I'm so geeked for the regular season to start.  I have to give a lot of credit to my friend John Frakes, who - even though he dislikes baseball - is one of the funniest guys to watch a baseball game with.  Johnny Damon:  Tattoo, cause he looks like the midget from Fantasy Island, if he weren't a midget, that is.  Sometimes just called J.D.  Nomar:  Unfortunately Nomar became "Mr. Useless" at the end of the season, and I can't really remember what we were calling him before that.  Manny:  Manny has had a lot of nicknames, but the one that has really stuck is Bubba.  And we mean that affectionately.  Any ball that Manny must field can also be accompanied by singing calliope-like circus music.  Kevin Millar:  is and always will be Big League, since he looks more or less dead on the guy on the Big League gum pouches.  Trot Nixon:  you can either call him Trawt, with your best redneck drawl, or Crowbake.  It's one of those obscure things - my crazy ass station partner said Trot's filthy batting helmet looked like he had baked a crow on it...for some reason it stuck.  David Ortiz:   Zeus or Thor.  For awhile we were calling him Shrek but we noticed he always had bad at-bats after that.  Too mean-spirited.  Jason Varitek:  JVT, nothing special there.  Pedro Martínez:  Sweet P.   I can't explain this one, though, because it's slanderous, and when you make $9.50 an hour you generally try to avoid lawsuits. That's all I can think of off the top of my head.  I have to go to work early today because we are doing an off-site party of 250 (what a nightmare.)  Too bad the Scum beat us yesterday.  Adios.

       Remember what I said yesterday  about the Sox waiting until after the season to work out an extension with Pedro?  According to the Herald it looks like I'm probably wrong, and I couldn't be happier.   Pedro was involved in face-to-face  urlLink negotiations  with Sox management, including John Henry, and was said to leave the meeting "happy."  No details were made public, but the article states: "It is relatively rare for a player to be present at these types of meetings, and it is obvious the presence of both Martínez and Henry was a sign of willingness on both sides to be flexible about forging a path that would lead to a mutually satisfying deal." The Sox are  urlLink saying  (again) that they are making a "concerted effort" to resign Nomar, despite not having answered Nomar's agent Arn Tellum a response to their recent counteroffer.  Hopefully this is just lip service.  It seems pretty obvious to me that Nomar expects to be overpayed and have his ass kissed since his feelings got hurt during the whole A-Rod debacle.   I've already written about a million times why it's really okay for the Sox if Nomar walks, and I'm not going to get into it again.   Speaking of free agents, D.Lowe was awesome yesterday!  It's killing me not to be able to see these games!!  No Sox spring training games on in Cincinnati, not even their games against the Reds.  I hope we beat the living be-Jesus out of the Scum today.  Go Sox!

       It's good to be back  after a week of banishment from the blogosphere, thanks to the morons at Upsaid.com.  I geeked out yesterday when I ordered the MLB Extra Innings package from the cable company.  The regular season is just around the corner!     Sox news:  Ramiro Mendoza has sustained yet another  urlLink injury , this time by cutting his finger on the seam of a baseball during a game of catch.  Absolutely ridiculous.  Next thing you know this guy is going to pull his hamstring rolling out of bed in the morning. More  urlLink speculation  about Nomar going to the Dodgers.   And an interesting article in ProJo about Pedro's  urlLink suspect velocity .  It's only spring training - it's very possible that Pedro doesn't want to throw as hard as he can.  Other pitchers aren't.  The suggestion of a problem with Pedro's mechanics being caused by a sore shoulder are a little bit more disturbing, but could very well just be media garbage.  I am starting to think that Sox management may wait until the end of the season before offering Pedro a contract, just to guage his durability.

       For all ya'll haterz out there,  put Pedro's last start in your pipe and smoke it.  As I said before, I don't care if Pedro never throws another pitch above 90mph ever again, as long as he keeps striking people out.  Petey looked nasty, and with some help from Manny, Ortiz and Bellhorn ended up with the W.  Sox 4, Jays 1. This is my reenactment of Ortiz's at-bat in the 12th inning of today's game:  Ortiz:  Hey Lopez, do you like apples?  Lopez:   Ya, who doesn't?  Ortiz (as he's trotting around second):   Great!  How do you like them apples? Mr. Clutch was back at it today, smashing a two-run walk-off homer into the Moster seats to bring the Sox a 6-4 victory over the Blue Jays.  Schilling looked good, having acrued 8 k's by the time my parents came to get us in the sixth inning.   Imagine our surprise when we got home from Easter dinner and the game was still on.  Mark Malaska had a fantastic shut-out 1 2/3 innings, and then we all know how the game ended. I have to say that it was wrong of me to be so down on Tito the other day, that I realize that he had no one else in the bullpen to go to, and that it is only the first couple games of the season.  So Tito, I'm apologising....for now.  This doesn't mean, however, that I no longer DETEST Bobby "Why Won't You Just Throw A Fucking Strike" Jones or Ramiro "DL" Mendoza.   Next game is Tuesday against Baltimore again.  Man, I'm already sick of watching that team!

       So many frustrating things  that I don't know where to start.  Tito evidently wanted to get home in time to catch "Sanford & Son" on TV Land tonight, as he left an  obviously  struggling Bobby Jones on the mound in the thirteenth inning with absolutely  no one  warming up in the bullpen.  The umpire didn't seem very interested in continuing to do his job either, as he screwed Jones out of about 4 strikes --- not that Jones  needed  any help SUCKING.   So thanks Tito, for allowing Bobby Jones to give up a walk-off  walk , of all things.  Once again, the Sox leave a pathetic amount of men on base (I got home from work in the top of the seventh and saw the bases left loaded  twice. ) Watching an out-right ass-whooping is one thing.  Watching the manager fucking  give  the game away is extremely frustrating.  I know it's only the fourth game of the season, but why squander a loss just because good ol' Terry wants to go home and enjoy a nice hot cup of chamomile tea and some milk toast before bedtime???  Screw this, I'm going to go play Final Fantasy V.

       Nice second inning last night.   Was 2003-esque.  Nothing makes me happier than seeing Miguel Tejada fuck up big time - ever since he flipped out about Pump-Fist in Game 5 of the ALDS I've more or less hated his guts.  And it was all thanks to that asshole that we were able to have a seven run inning.  Man, it's nice to be able to hear Jerry Remy and Don Orsillo again.  Speaking of Pump-Fist, he didn't look too shabby either.  I'm excited about watching Wakey tonight!

       I was gonna write last night  but I accidentally got too drunk.  Was very happy with yesterday's game.  I met my husband at the bar after I got off of work and spent about five minutes drilling him on all the details of Curt Schilling's start.  "How many strikeouts?  What did his stuff look like?  How did he look in a Sox uniform?"   I'll tell you how he looked - he looked like he was born to wear the red, white and blue.  Foulke did awesome as well.  I was a little dismayed about Millar and Damon colliding and about Manny's bruised quad, but no major damage was done.  (If Manny is still experiencing any soreness I would be more than happy to massage it for him.  ::cough::happyending::coughcough::) I'll write more later after we watch the tape of tonight's game.   Oh, I almost forgot to mention - go and read the Red Sox Roundtable at  urlLink Red Sox Haven.   A bunch of Sox bloggers answer Sox questions (including myself, except he has me as Stacey Martin instead of Sarah Martin - which is really funny if you know me personally.  Stacey is the most cloyingly feminine name ever, and I resemble a slightly gangsta'ed out 13 year old boy.)

       God I love Opening Day.   My friend and I headed down to Fifth street to watch the Reds parade today - let me tell you, you never see more Reds fans in Cincinnati than on Opening Day.  By June you won't even be able to find one if you put out a reward.  Baseball has been on television all day, what a glorious thing.  I was just working on a painting and had the A's game on, just reveling in the sound of the announcers and the crowd.  (Should show you how much I miss baseball since I think the A's are a bunch of whining douchebags, and they're playing the Rangers about whom I couldn't care less.) I'm super jealous of my husband, as he is off tomorrow and will be able to watch Schill's first start live while I'm at work cooking creamed morel mushrooms and sauteeing sole.  Perhaps I can sweet talk him into taping the game but not watching it until I get home.  :)  Now  that  would be true love. I wonder if the sight of Johnny Damon will ever cease to make me laugh.  I love when his hat flies off as he's tearing across centerfield and all of the sudden hair is just flowing everywhere.  Manny was also pretty entertaining with his off-tha-chain braids.  Looks like he's been hanging out with Ludacris.  "Watch out my outfit's ree-diculous/In the club lookin so conspicuous!"

       Hmmmm.   Weird game.  I'm going to drop the "cheerleader" thing for a moment and say that it's not an understatement to call me "alarmed" during Pedro's half of the second inning.  He appeared to just lose it completely.  Very unnerving, considering all the speculation about him for the past two weeks (which I by and large have chosen to ignore.)  Funny how he nailed his "buddy" Segui after the arm slot comment of a couple weeks ago.  However, Pedro did settle down quite nicely, but the damage was already done.   Wait --- not all the damage:  Timlin helped to finished us off early...well, Timlin and the 14 batters that we left on base.   Manny had a great night, with the exception of an extremely half-ass last at bat (don't be afraid to swing that bat every now and then, buddy.)  He looked sharp in the outfield.  And aside from the bunt down the first base line with two runners on and two outs (someone please tell me that this was not Francona's idea,)  I was really pleased with Pokey's performance tonight.  Bellhorn wasn't too shabby either.  Overall, it just looked like the Sox were a little rusty.  I don't expect to even remember this game in two weeks.  Remember the first two games of last season vs. the D-Rays???

       "The Rivalry."   Dear Media:  Please.  I beg you.  Go away.  Stop writing about the Red Sox and Yankees.  I can't stand it anymore.  Seriously.  Make Dan Shaughnessy EARN a living and send him to Bagdhad, tape Millar's mouth shut, whatever it takes.  Just no more analyzing, no more documentaries, no more "curse specials."  I'm about to hole myself up in a concrete bunker with cyanide tablets hidden under my tongue in case a copy of SI should pop through the mail slot.  At this point I don't even care if the "journalist" in question is a Sox fan or even a baseball fan - I've just heard enough.  Pretty soon even the sight of Pedro playing bocci ball with Zim's face isn't going to be funny anymore.  So find something else to hype.  Go write about Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony.  Get lost.  You're not welcome here anymore.

      Blowout today.  No matter - I'm surrounded by friends and piña coladas.  Usually I am irate when the Sox get a loss as sloppy as today's was...however, I know that the team is biding their time until Trot (and Nomar) comes back and that these nightmares will come.  It was my prediction that the Sox would be on top of the Yankees by at least two games at the end of this homestand.  Didn't happen, yet I'm not scared.  Not yet.  I don't think the season has even  started  for my injury-ridden Sox. Mr. Useless due back in a week if things keep going well.  But what about Trot???

      Up-and-down game today.  Schilling was pitching a perfect game for 5+ innings, until I happened to mention it to my mom on the phone (by way of explaining why I was a little distracted,) and then next thing you know Randy Winn hit a single to left field.  Keith Foulke got his first blown save for the Red Sox today, but the offense battled back to tie the score, then went on to win on a walk-off homerun by none other than Dave McCarty in extra innings.  Pokey made some hot plays today at shortstop - Nomar who??

      Sox won.  I'm watching the tape of the game right now, so I don't have anything to say about it yet.  I just know that the score was 8-4. But the thing that I wanted to do in this blog entry is give a shout out to my two favorite blogs in the blog-o-sphere.  I decided to list two because I have two seperate categories of blogs that I read daily: Sox blogs, and then everything else (and the "everything else" is always baseball related, cause I'm a nerd like that.)   First of all, my favorite Sox blog is definitely  urlLink Joy of Sox .  This is the first blog I ever check when I'm on the computer.  For one thing, Alan has great links, great thoughts, and great stats.  For another thing, he talks a lot about politics as well, and his point of view just happens to be close to mine and a lot of the people I work with, so I stay informed on two fronts.  So thanks a lot to Alan, who is my Sox blogging hero!  (No sarcasm, for once!) My other favorite blog, non-Sox related, is definitely  urlLink Reds & Blues , a Reds blog written by Scott whom I attended all four years of high school with.  And it's NOT just cause we're good friends.  If you want to know ANYTHING at all about the Cincinnati Reds, just ask Scott.  I'm serious.  Anything.  And added to that, he's funny as hell.  And knowing how the Reds are doing keeps me in conversations with the dishwashers at work who normally eschew AL games as "boring."   (Whatever.) So I'm off to watch the game.  But thanks to those two guys for doing a wonderful job.  Never stop - I'm hooked!!!

      Usually somewhere around seven o'clock I'll be standing behind the line at work and catch a glimpse of the clock by the server's station and think "Damn, first pitch is in __ minutes, and service hasn't even started yet," or something along those lines.  Last night was no different.  But let me tell you, after I had my friend Shane call the bar upstairs around 8:30 to get the score my nightly regret at not being able to be home to watch the game completely disappeared. It was an ugly game, but that's what happens every now and then.  The Sox beat the Marlins something fierce last year, and then Florida went on to win the World Series.  I'm not too torn up about it --- just grateful that I wasn't around to watch. Trot is going to play seven innings in the field tomorrow as part of his rehab assignment.  I'm ecstastic at the thought of Trot's return - it's like the season is starting all over again.  I've completely quit worrying about Nomar because I like (read: prefer) Pokey. When I walked into our apartment building and checked the mail last night I was pleasantly surprised to see Manny on the cover of Sporting News.  Nothing in there we didn't already know.  "This just in - he's a good hitter."

      Another Sox win last night!!  They trumped the A's thanks to an error by Oakland shortstop Bobby Crosby and a GIGANTIC 3-run homer by Jason Varitek.  Derek Lowe gave up his necessary 5 runs but still walked away with the W, perhaps thanks in part to the players wearing their red jerseys which they were wearing last time Lowe got a win...when was that?  I'm having a hard time remembering, must have been awhile ago.  Anastacio Martinez looked bad last night, giving up consecutive hits and getting pulled from the game in the seventh with two men on.  Embree and Timlin were able to get the Sox out of the inning, however, and Keith Foulke closed it out.  How great has he been this year??  Hot damn!!  I love watching the A's lose.  I hope all their turd fans are in absolute agony.   Sox go for their second consecutive sweep tonight, Arroyo vs. Mulder.  Wish I didn't have to work!! Oh, and a cool thing:  I don't know if you've heard about the nightmare going on in the Dominican and Haiti right now, but flash flooding and mudslides have killed over 600 people there, with up to 400 still unaccounted for.  Pedro Martinez has apparently contacted some of his fellow ballplayers and countrymen with the idea to set up a relief fund for the families affected by this disaster.  Very, very cool thing to do.  You go, Pete.

He's an annoying piece of trash, and I'm embarrassed that people who don't know anything about the Red Sox might think that he's some sort of ambassador for the team.  He's not.  He's a douchebag who's career is way past it's twilight, to borrow a Duquette-ian turn of phrase.  I've got one word for you, Ben.     GIGLI.   Now get out of here, I think I just heard your mummy calling. Speaking of grating, irritating things, is anyone else made sort of uncomfortable by that hotdog commercial where the guy is mooning over the hotdogs, talking about how "girthy" they are and how much he loves the word and the state of being that is "girthy," and then crams the hotdog into his mouth and like moans?  Or am I the only perverted one?  Ugh.   It is now the sixth inning of the Sox game.  I walked in from work just in time to see Derek Lowe's less than spectacular yet singularly Lowe-ish fifth inning, wherein he allowed three runs to score.  I'm nervous.  Tito better not have pulled a Grady by sending Lowe back out there for one inning too many...

      Wow.  Now Bill Mueller is on the DL - he will be having arthroscopic knee surgery and will be out for 6-8 weeks.  Not as bad as missing Trot and Nomar has been, however.  Youkilis seems pretty solid in the field and isn't as bad with the bat as, say, Cesar Crespo.  Andy Dominique has been called up from AAA as well, and struck out last night in his major league debut. I was pretty surprised when I got home from work last night and the score of the game was 9-2.  I actually did a triple take to make sure it wasn't actually a zero instead of a nine. Not that I didn't think the Sox could win the game, it's just that when Tim Hudson is pitching, you don't expect to see a big score like that.  Ortiz, Manny and Bellhorn came up big-time last night.  I will admit to not really paying too much attention to the game, however, as I just discovered the fantastic world of Nintendo emulators and have been busy playing Castlevania, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros.  What can I say - I'm a geek.  And a slacker.

      Tonight my husband and I went to our first Reds game of the season, and it was pretty damn enjoyable.  We had great seats to watch the Reds complete their four-game sweep of the Astros, second row of the second tier of bleachers, surrounded by a rowdy bunch of hillbillies and frat boys, (several of whom were brandishing brooms.)  Griffey Jr. (that's right, he's    still  not injured) crushed a 400+ foot homer to straight-away centerfield, and Austin Kearns hit another homerun that landed right below our seats.  (I watched the highlights on ESPN and I could see myself in the stands.  Unfortunately, Mike was at the concession stand buying me a Pepsi.  True love!) Also we just got our income tax return back and bought MVP Baseball 2005.  If only our guinea pig hadn't chewed through the cord of our second PS2 controller....

      Two great games this weekend, and I enjoyed them to the fullest.  My prediction about work on Saturday sadly enough came true.  My station partner and I relaxed after a rough night in the trenches in my nice air-conditioned apartment and watched a tape of Saturday night's game.  Wow, Manny's nearly identical homers on two consecutive days...Unbelievable.  That guy is amazing.  Pedro allowed his requisite two runs per game in the second inning, but otherwise looked alright.  Manny's moonshot got him off the hook for a loss, but the win went to Anastacio Martínez on his major league debut.  He's filling in for Scott Williamson, who has either a sore elbow or shoulder, I can't remember. Today's game was awesome.  Wakey did a great job, allowing two runs and striking out four.  JD, Ortiz and Bellhorn all reached base three times today.  Said Ortiz about his  urlLink speed  on the basepaths: "I kinda look like Johnny Damon in slow motion."  I love it.  Sox won the game 7-2 and completed their third sweep of the season (all three against division rivals, might I add.)  Curt Schilling vs. Tim Hudson on Tuesday. I forgot to post  urlLink this article  a couple days ago, but someone finally suggested Pokey Reese as a candidate for starting shortstop next year if (when) Nomar departs to free agency.  I suggested this months ago, when Nomar started his hardcore bitching.  Pokey is a great defensive player and hey - his batting average is better than Jeter's.  Not to mention that he will be cheaper than Nomar and isn't a bitter, whining baby.

      What a game last night.  Was awesome to see the Sox deal out a legitimate ass-whooping instead of just kind-of looking lucky like they have been the past couple weeks.  Arroyo was having some pitch placement problems, but the offense kept the Sox in the game the whole way.  In the eighth inning, with the score tied at 5, Manny hit an absolute bomb off of Mike Nakamura to spark a 6-run inning.  (Nakamura, don't throw the same pitches to Manny over and over again, and if you do, at least don't leave them hanging over the center of the fricking plate...unless, of course, you  like  public humiliation.)  Everyone contributed to this win - including two hits from Pokey and Bellhorn and 1+ innings of scoreless work from Timlin.  I have to check what Pokey's batting average is now...if he's anywhere near .275 I have a lot of shit to talk to my husband tonight after work. Ortiz signed a contract extension for 2 years plus a team option for a third -  YAAAAAY!   I love it!  Papi grande is here to stay! Williamson on the 15-day disabled list with a tender shoulder.  There's something you don't see every day, a key Sox player on the disabled list.   Johnny Damon shaved his beard yesterday and looks like Tattoo from Fantasy Island once again.  Apparently a crowd of 1500 showed up to watch him get shorn...wow, that's all I can say about that.   Work is going to be god-awful tonight, I can just tell, so wish me luck.

      Well believe me, I wish I could eat my words, but...I told you so about Derek Lowe.  Not that you, Anonymous Sox Fan, needed to be told that Lowe's pitching thusfar this season has by and large resembled a steaming heap of hot garbage.  Tonight's game vs. the D-Bags seemed to be more about which pitching staff was worse, not which team was better.  Zambrano had to leave the mound with a visible shit-stain on the seat of his pants in the shape of Florida after the fourth inning, came back in the fifth to suck a little more, then left the game permanently.  Derek Lowe didn't hang around that long...he left having pitched 2 2/3 innings during which he was tagged for six runs.  Against the DEVIL RAYS, ladies and gentlemen.  The offense did an alright job trying to catch up, but it just didn't happen for the Sox tonight.  It's okay.  Sox are going back to Boston to face Roy Halladay for the quadrillionth-millionth time this season, whoop-dee-do, why do Canadians have baseball teams?

      Various things: 1) Sox pick up another win tonight thanks to a solid outing by Schilling and offensive help by J.D. and Manny.  Sox  could  sweep tomorrow, but Derek "Loose Cannon" Lowe is pitching, so I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you. 2) Theo & Co. are actively shopping Byung Hyun Kim, and are reportedly even willing to eat some of his 2-year, $10 million contract.   GOOD.   That guy is a waste of money, I would rather see a dishwasher from work out on the mound than that guy, and I hope he gets a case of gonorrhea so severe that he feels compelled to hold it for hours before he pees due to the excruciating burning sensations.  Oh wait...if he gets gonorrhea, then he would have to have had sex, which means he might have enjoyed himself, and I definitely don't want that.  Maybe a horrendous urinary tract infection.  And I know what you're thinking - who will Sarah pick on merciliessly now that her least favorite player will no longer be on the team?  Have no fear!  There is always Brian Daubach and Cesar Crespo, (and Nomar, if he ever decides that he is well enough to play.) 3) Speaking of Nomar, it looks like Trot will be coming back first, and that's fine with me.  If I have to watch Kevin Millar do one of his patented "Sack-o-Taters" bellyflops out in right field I might cringe so severely that I will shrink and become lost in the seat cushion. 4) The announcers on YES are the seat-sniffingest, most self-congratulatory assholes I've ever heard of.   5) I love being a cook.  Why, you ask?  Soft-shell crabs, cipollini onions, ramps, fiddlehead ferns, alaskan king salmon, white asparagus, meyer lemons...I get to play with all this awesome food all day, and get  paid.   How cool is that?  I love what I do...this week, hehe. 6) I am not, I repeat (more for my benefit than yours) NOT going to get upset about the Manny on-the-trading-block-still rumor on DirtDogs (which I read second-hand through Bambino's Curse since I do not read DirtDogs anymore.)  Nope.  Not upset at all.  Cooooool as a cucumber.  Full steam ahead, confidence in management, wanting to field a competetive teamOHMYGOD WHAT IN THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING THEO YOU TWERP DO NOT TRADE MY MOST FAVORITE RED SOX EVER I JUST GOT USED TO HAVING HIM BACK AFTER THE TRAUMATIC OFF-SEASON WHO WILL HIT THE HOMERS? WHO WILL GET THE RIBBIES? WHO WILL I SHAMELESSLY UNDRESS WITH MY EYES DURING EVERY AT-BAT?  WHOOOOOO????anyway, um, what was I saying? 7) While I'm on the topic of DirtDogs and Manny, let my very pettily point out that I am...amused, I suppose would be the right word, by the way DirtDog brazenly kisses Manny's ass on Manny's website, given all the trash that he has talked/will talk again about Mr. Ramírez.  It's petty.  I know that.  But I dislike insincerity and ball-washing in any arena.  And this is my forum, damnit, and I'm entitled to my petty opinions.

      Boring game yesterday.  Halladay finally managed to get a win against Pedro as our scrub-lineup was d-e-a-d dead once again, with the usual exception of Manny Ramírez, who got his 24th RBI yesterday.  The umpire made some of the worst calls I have ever seen in a televised game of baseball.  I heard during the game that the two run homer Pedro gave up was his seventh of 2004....the exact same number of homeruns he allowed during ALL of last season.  I'm worried.  I am.  I can't help it.   Saturday's game was much better, although of course I was at work through the whole thing.  Arroyo pitched a gem, shutting the Jays out for eight innings.  Bellhorn, Ortiz and Youkilis all went deep - and Youkilis' homer came on only the second major-league at-bat of his career.  I've read that he and Lenny DiNardo had to travel in skimpy Hooter's girls uniforms yesterday as part of rookie hazing.  Picturing Kevin Youkilis in a Hooter's outfit makes me feel sort of....queasy. The Sox are all resting down in Florida today, before they start a three game series at that dump they call Tropicana Field.  Perhaps that screaming fat guy will be in the hospital undergoing septuple-bipass surgery...As if anything could make that ballpark any worse and more empty sounding, you've got some fat bastard screaming throughout the whole game, completely unhindered by any crowd noise as there is no crowd because that team has no fans.  You can hear high pop flys rattling around the catwalks over the television broadcast, it's that quiet in there...I hate the Trop.

      WTF is up with this team?  More errors, more runs allowed in the first inning - it's enough to make me dry-heave.  Excuses?   urlLink Schilling  had this to say:  "When your playing as many good teams as we have to play and you don't execute fundamental baseball you're not going to win more than you lose."  Good teams?? Good teams??!?  They've been playing the fucking Indians, Royals and Blue Jays, for christ's sake...the last "good" team they played was the fucking  Rangers,  and it was a sweep!  And who do we have on the mound tonight to try to rectify their losing ways??  Derek-fricking-Lowe.  Great.  Just great.  Derek Lowe with his almost 5-ERA and astroturf.  I'm glad I'll be at work all night.   Speaking of headcases, BK is  urlLink more of a freak  than I thought.  Trade him!   Anyone else feeling a little impatient with Tito right now? Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be linecooks:  I cut the tip of my pinkie finger completely off yesterday cutting squash.  While the wound itself isn't actually that bad, it bled from 3:00 until around 5:30, and now the band-aid is stuck to the wound and I'm not looking forward to ripping it off.  Maybe it will loosen up in the shower...

      Hey, remember when I said that Bellhorn wasn't striking out a lot?  Well, I lied.  He strikes out.  A lot.  So who's going to be the second baseman once Nomar comes back?  Or is Nomar going to chip a nail and get a papercut on the same day and be out for the season?  If/when Nomar comes back, which Nomar is going to show up - Nomaaah, or Mr. Useless?  And Trot!  What about Trot??  Right field just looks too well-kept without Trot's patch out there. So the Sox are off to Toronto today to play the Blue Jays.   urlLink Kevin Millar  made this brilliant summation of the series with Cleveland:  "We were in every game, but they scored more runs than us."  File under: No Shit Sherlock.  Sounds like he got that quote out of the Big Book Of Grady-isms. I'm off to another glorious day at the salt-mines.  Let's go Sox!!

      I'm sick to goddamn-death of the Indians.  Haven't we been playing like the same three teams for the past month and a half??  Three errors in tonight's game - frustrating.  The umpire evidently used a refrigerator box as a guideline for the strike zone tonight. Sideline: has anybody noticed how raggedy Millar's socks are?  When I was at the game in Cleveland my friend pointed out a run in his socks, and now I've noticed that they've turned into out-right holes.  Ghettooooo! Headed for the Skydome next.  C'mon Sox!!!

      I forgot to mention some things last night because I was feeling tired and crabby.  First of all, I couldn't be happier to see Byung Hyun Kim sent down to AAA...Actually, I could be happier if they just traded his ass away.  He absolutely SUCKED the other day (2 runs scored on a passed ball had me raining down a hail of abuse onto the tv screen like no other,) and I hope that he gets the worst case of syphilis known to mankind.  I hate to say "I told you so," but I frickin' told you so about this guy!  (Whoever "you" is.)  He's an injury prone headcase who can't relieve cause he doesn't "want" to, and who can't start because he sucks, and can't close because any slight amount of pressure causes this guy to melt like butter on a hot skillet.  And this is the guy the Sox saw fit to pay $5 million a year for the next two years.  Trade him for another bench player, trade him for a ham sandwich, I don't really care, just don't ever make me have to watch him "pitch" ever again. Second of all, now that it seems that Nomar is getting close (I hope) to a return, who should play second?  Reese the Golden Glover, or Bellhorn, the guy that is something ridiculous like third on the team in OBP?  I really have a soft spot in my heart for Pokey (and I have my pride staked on my prediction that he was going to end up batting .275 this year,) but I have to say that except for maybe the days that D-Lowe is pitching, Bellhorn should be there.  I like his approach at the plate - doesn't strike out a lot, draws a country-shit-load of walks - and his defense isn't that shabby either.  I mean, if the Sox are behind and there are men on base with one or two outs, who would you rather have at the plate, Bellhorn or Pokey?

       Sox beat Indians 5-2.   ¡Pedro fue maravilloso!  Eleven k's, 2 earned runs, and a jeri-curl that would make Sexual Chocolate see green.   Less talking + more pitching = better performance.   Congratulations to Manny Ramírez for becoming a US citizen yesterday.  Way to go, Manny!  I have serious doubts about being able to pass the citizenship test myself and I was born here, so good for you.  (I said that the capital of Montana was Billings the other day, even though I used to know that it was Helena a long time ago.) Unfortunately I'm not feeling particularly Bloggy tonight...Work was tiring and I have a pretty bad sunburn that has leached all the energy out of me for the past two days.  Another equation for you:  sunburn + 110º kitchen + being surrounded by open flames and ovens = severe discomfort. So, hasta mañana.

       Git 'er done!   I just did my civic duty as loud and proud member of Red Sox Nation and spent 15 minutes stuffing the living hell out of the All-Star Ballot box to help David Ortiz get into the 2004 All-Star Game.  You can vote up to 25 times, so everyone knows what to do! Big ups to my mom today, cause it's Mother's Day!  My mom is one of the coolest people in the entire world, and the older I get the cooler she seems to get!  Love you mom! Speaking of my mom, I'll be chilling with her all afternoon so I'll miss the game, but I'll write later after I've watched the tape.  C'mon, D-Lowe!

       My prediction might come true after all.   We have this ugly-ass yellow plastic chair that we dragged in from the hall a few months ago that people have started to draw all over in Sharpie marker.  One of the pieces of graffiti on the seat of the chair is my old man's prediction for Manny's stats this year - slightly over-optimistic if you ask me but that's Mike for you.  So I was cleaning up one day and suddenly a prediction of my own came to me, completely out of the blue, and I wrote it on the back cushion of the chair:  "Pokey = .275 in '04."  Mike comes home, takes one look at it, and tells me that I'm smoking crack.  But thanks to the huge can of whoop-ass that Pokey opened today he's batting somewhere in the .260's, I believe.   Great game today - Schilling basically slammed the Royals up against a locker, stole their lunch money and sent them home crying for their mothers.  Meanwhile the Sox were making it around the bases like it was a roller-derby, thanks to the in-the-park and nearly out-of-the-park home runs by Pokey Reese, a homerun by ::gasp:: David McCarty, and doubles by just about everyone else.  Pokey Reese wins the Pimp of the Day award.  Dave McCarty wins the Even Blind Squirrels Find the Occassional Nut award. Mr. Useless took live batting practice today.  Whoop-dee-doo.  Okay, I think my insomnia has almost run its course.  Time to lay it down.  Goodnight!

       Urrr-body on the team get tipsy!!!   What a sweet comeback last night!  Jonathan was whooping as hard as I was when Manny crossed homeplate and he's not even a Sox fan!  I loved the expression on Manny's face as he crossed homeplate, like a little kid.  Que mono!  It was also sweet to see Trot come out on the field at the end.  He's in Boston getting his quad checked out by Dr. Morgan, and as soon as he gets that taken care of he'll start a rehab assignment.  Hurry, Trot, for the love of God!!! On a completely non-baseball-related topic, I just discovered the miracle that is iTunes.  This allows me to download all the awful booty rap songs that I secretly enjoy but would never buy because the rest of the cd is most likely garbage - like what I'm listening to right now, "Good Times," by Styles P...actually, isn't this the batting song that Manny got in trouble for a couple seasons ago?  Ha - it was baseball related after all!  :)   In any case, my husband is apalled by my iTunes library, and every time I play it he gives me that "I married you?" look.   Um, what else.... Oh ya - EVERYBODY WRITE IN ORTIZ AS ALL STAR FIRSTBASEMAN!!!  We gotta get him in there!  I've worked out a couple deals at work with some of my friends and fellow baseball fans wherein they will write in Ortiz in exchange for me voting for all Reds players on the NL ticket.  Tell a friend!  Don't let Orteezy get dissed like that!!!  (Repeat after me - Orteezy.  Orteezy.) On further reflection, I have to wonder why in the hell Manny picked this song for his batting music...I mean, the beat is tight and the hook is cool, but has anyone ever listened to the words??  Jesus...."Every day i need an ounce and a half...cause if i'm sober, dog, i might just flip, grab my guns and hold something up...I smoke like a chimney, matter fact I smoke like a gun when a killer sees his enemy...I'm gonna finish you before I finish the Dutch."

       Okay.   First things first.  I was able to attend my first Sox game of the year on Monday.  Unfortunately the game turned out to be a pathetic 2-1 loss against the Cleveland Indians.  The bats were dead, people.  D-E-A-D.  Except for David's RBI double off the centerfield wall and Tek's double there really wasn't any excitement.  And let me take a minute to say what a bunch of rednecks people in Cleveland are.  Both times I've made trips up there the Jake has been filled with zit-faced, buck-toothed, backwards-ass Missing Link types.  Some hillbilly behind me actually stood up and screamed "Ortiz, go back and live in the trees!" during Ortiz's last at-bat.  Fucking ridiculous.  I ended up getting into a confrontation with the gap-toothed appalachian fourteen-year old bride and her pizza-faced boy friend sitting next to us over the fact that Omar Vizquel failed to run out a grounder to short, saying that I didn't understand how come Vizquel could get away with being a lazy ass while Manny Ramírez couldn't.  The only response I got was (stick your lower lip under your upper teeth, stick your upper teeth out as far as you can while tucking up your upper lip and say with your best hick accent:) "Omar don't get booed in Cleveland!"  In any case, we had cool seats - front row, right/center field.  I am forever grateful to my friend Lacey who was cool and spontaneous enough to actually drive my crazy ass up to Cleveland when I had only suggested the idea two hours earlier.  Hopefully next time I get to see the Sox in Fenway with Paulie and Allie they will actually  win  that game. Um, other news...Speaking of winning, it was a real relief to walk into the house last night and see that the Sox were finally on top.  Hopefully last night was a sign that the bats are going to wake up again.  Trot, Nomar - please come back!!  I can't stand to watch another game with Crespo, McCarty, Reese and Bellhorn all in the line-up at the same time.  Dare I even mention Brian "AA" Daubach.  Nothing is more heart-sinking than watching the Sox battle the bases loaded only to find that the next batter is Brian "the Rally Killer" Daubach. I feel like I should say something about the whole Pedro situation, but I can't really come up with anything.  I blame his big fucking mouth for the 5-game losing streak.  I think he's a selfish, whining bitch and I'm tired of him trying to hold the fans hostage to wring more money (which as of now he doesn't deserve) out of the Sox organization.  Maybe if he didn't have a 4.4 era, an often dead-looking fastball and a shoulder held together with duct tape and chewing gum.  Down with millionaire whiners!!!  It was kind of sweet to see his boyfriend try to help Pedro out by volunteering to defer 5 mil a year toward Pedro's salary.  I hope that makes Pedro feel extremely bad about himself.  I know that if I was walking around the kitchen demanding a raise and bad-mouthing chef and one of my co-workers offered to give me an extra dollar-an-hour raise out of their own paycheck I would feel like a big douchebag.

       I'm back!   I have been without the internet for the past three weeks or so thanks to my dipshit ISP, but it's all good now.  After reinstalling my operating system, all my drivers and getting a new modem I can finally update my blog once again!  And my computer runs a lot faster now, so it wasn't all in vain. I got lots to talk about.  A friend and I took a spur of the moment trip to Cleveland on Monday to watch the Sox/Indians game.  Schilling pitched a good game, but the bats were dead, dead, dead.  Sox on a losing skid.  Pedro decides to open his big mouth again and turn into The Biggest Bitch on the Planet.  Manny is still my favorite.  I'll write more later but I gotta go to work.  Hasta luego.

       urlLink    Send in the clowns.&nbsp; urlLink    Click  urlLink here  to hear the new Red Sox theme song.  Okay, there are so many problems with this team right now that it is hard for me to single out any one problem as being worse than another...but I have decided to place most of the blame on Terry Francona.  The Red Sox look absolutely face-down in the water right now, and Francona is doing nothing to motivate them outside of blabbing his normal drivel about how the team is about to turn the corner and if they keep on trying good things are going to happen blah blah blah.  Face it - Francona is way in over his head on this one.  This asshole couldn't manage his way out of a wet paper bag.  I wish I had this asshole's cellphone number so that I could scream directly into his ear (or even his voicemail) about how much I hate his guts and what a shitty job he's doing.   - why is Brian Daubach in AAA instead of, say...Cesar Crespo?  I mean, I know that Crespo has more versatility as a position player, but the man has absolutely NOTHING to offer offensively.  At least when Dauber gets hot he gets hot.  Crespo has never even been lukewarm. - someone PLEASE fucking tell me why Kevin Millar is still in the fricking lineup every day.  Hell, if Crespo is that important to the goddamn bench, why not just send Millar down to Pawtucket for Daubach???  Millar sucks at offense, he sucks at defense, and his little hair gimmicks aren't funny anymore.  He just looks pathetic and desperate.  I would shed nary a tear if the Sox just outrighted this guy or - better yet - somehow managed to package his worthless ass in some sort of trade for a player with a MODICUM of value to the team. - speaking of Millar, surely we can find a better defensive first baseman.  Ortiz is mediocre - at least he's no worse than Millar, is left handed and has a longer reach.  But better yet, why not put Dave McCarty in the lineup on a regular basis for awhile, just to see how things work out.  He can't be any worse than Millar at the plate, and he sure is a HELL of a lot better defensively.  Or what about putting Youkilis at first when Mueller returns at third, and then having Bellhorn and Pokey platoon second....OR -  get Nomar the fuck off the team and let Pokey take over his rightful spot as Red Sox starting shortstop.  I'm tired of seeing Nomar pouting and bitching and finding every little excuse to throw himself a pity party.  Guess what Nomar, I DON'T feel bad for you.  I hope that Theo is aggressively shopping that asshole for another bat, for another starting pitcher, for a pack of gum and a 32 oz. fountain drink, I don't care, just get him the fuck out of Boston.  Pokey would've had it. All that said...There are still some bright spots on the team.  Manny and Ortiz are having phenomenal years.  Schilling is doing great.  The bullpen isn't quite the ungodly nightmare that it was last year.  However, I don't hold much hope of a playoff berth at this point.  Even without the reports of in-fighting that have been circulating on the internet, the Sox are lifeless at best.  It would be one thing if this team had been a dark horse to begin with, like if they were rebuilding or they had a lot of unproven players or something like that.  But this team was built for October, and that's what makes their lackluster performance so unacceptable to me.  I mean, last night we turned off the game in the middle and I went to go on some cathartic killing sprees on Grand Theft Auto, and I was thinking as I was playing that maybe if I just forgot the Yankees I could still enjoy the season just by focusing on the wild card race...but even that seems out of reach right now, even though the Sox are currently tied for first.  I hate to say it, but I think I'm witnessing the beginning of a long, slow, painful end.

      First of all, I urge everyone (all ten of you who read this blog, anyway,) to go out and see  Fahrenheit 9/11.   Even if you're not a Democrat, even if you don't have the left wing leanings that I do, go out and watch this film - if not for the compelling anti-Bush arguements then at least to see footage that isn't shown to the country on the nightly news of what is really happening to our troops in Iraq. Second of all, don't forget to vote as many times as you can to get Ortiz into the All Star game.  Take a look at the other AL first basemen and tell me that you don't think he deserves it!  You can vote up to 25 times (per screen names,) and as Ortiz isn't even on the map yet in the voting he needs all the help he can get!!  (I've stuffed the ballot box 75 times already, so I practice what I preach.) And the Sox are on the eve of their third meeting with the MFYs.  I caused a small domestic dispute the other night by coming home drunk (my station partner and I smuggled a bottle of Captain Morgan into the theater with us - high school ahoy!) and ranting and raving about how the Sox were going to embarass themselves in the Bronx.  My husband disagreed, of course, and actually told me that he wasn't talking to me anymore and went to bed, and if you know how quiet and laid back my husband is then you can guess how obnoxious I was probably being.  So I'll admit to not being in a very good state of mind concerning the Red Sox right now.   However, all hope is not lost.  The pitching matchups are mostly in favor of the Sox.  Kevin Brown is still injured and will not pitch this series.  Tomorrow is Lowe vs. Vazquez...Vazquez is actually doing much better than I figured he would, but he has a propensity to give up the long ball, and with Manny, Ortiz, and Yankee-killer Trot in the lineup this could work in our favor.  Then Wakefield vs. Lieber (I think.) Lieber sucks, Wakey is WAY overdue, 'nuff said.  And Thursday concludes the series with Pedro vs. Hallsey...I don't think I need to say that I like our chances there.   I certainly wish that Schilling were pitching this series for a little more security, but I still think the Sox have a fighting chance.  A lot will depend on if the offense can keep clicking like it has been, and if the defense decides to plays= like they poured out of a Shriner clown circus car in the player's parking lot again. I'm looking forward to this series, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit to a little apprehension.  Even the Yanks winning two out of three would be mildly disasterous.  C'mon Sox!!!  Let's start the season already!!!

      Someone call Al Franken cause  I'm a Big Fat Liar.   You know the woman on Cops who has locked herself in the bathroom after a "domestic dispute" with her live-in boyfriend who is passed out on the couch with a PBR in his hand and a mesh hat on his head, and this lady is sobbing hysterically cause the boyfriend just beat her with a plastic duck decoy yet she refuses to have him arrested and press charges because "he didn't mean it and he loves me..." You know that woman?  Well that is me when it comes to the Red Sox.  I just can't stay mad. So ya, I watched the game last night.  And I'm glad I did because it was a gem.  It was Manny's game - the man went 3 for 4 with 5 RBIs and 9 put-outs in left field, the last of which was a dazzling diving catch to end the seventh.  Manny would have gone 4-4 if not for Abreu robbing him of what would have been his 21st homer with a nice catch by the Sox bullpen.  We're not taping over this one - this will be a nice game to drag out in the middle of January when we're suffering from withdrawal. Youkilis and Ortiz also had big games last night, but the most heartening thing for me to see was Varitek having a big night offensively.  He has been slumping for awhile now, and having him get hot again would be a wonderful asset.  TradeBait has been making good contact with the ball lately, too.  Once he gets his timing back together the middle of the lineup could be lethal...which is just what they need right now because has anyone taken a look at the schedule for July?  Yikes. So the Sox beat the Phillies' silly little asses to the tune of 12-1...Is this game just their requisite blow-out of the series, to be followed by the requisite two pathetic losses, or are the Sox at the turn of the tide?  Apparently Tito held a meeting with the team in his office last night to motivate them a little bit...we'll soon see if it worked or not.

      Well guess what everybody.  I'm  NOT  watching the game tonight.  That's right.  Fuck 'em.  I'm going out to see the midnight showing of "Fahrenheit 9-11" after work like all good Americans should do, and therefore I won't be home early enough to watch the tape of the "baseball game" (if that's what they're calling the lackadaisical shuffling that the Red Sox do these days.)  I don't care if Pedro's pitching.  I don't care what his record is vs. Jim Thome.  I don't care if Manny hits his 19th homer.  I'm  NOT  watching. It doesn't matter even if they win tonight, as they will simply turn around and lose tomorrow since it is absolutely important above all else that the Sox avoid the dreaded "win streak."  urlLink Quote  from Johnny Damon: "We haven't been that good in the last month.  Everyone's under a microscope right now until we go out there and start winning games."  Under a microscope - ya right.  Not when you've got that cheesy bald little fuck in there patting all you lame-os on the heinie every time you lose a game to make sure that your feelings aren't hurt.  Pussies.

      I don't even have the heart to rant.  Inexcusable.  This team is fucking pathetic.  I'm tired of watching this half-ass bullshit.  If I wanted to watch three hours worth of baseball played by a team that looked like they thought they were going to a barbeque but accidentally showed up to a major league baseball game I'd go be a Pirates fan.

      See?  What did I tell you?  Fuck momentum.  This team wouldn't know a winning streak if it walked up and bent a 9 iron over their fucking skulls.   If I were Terry Francona I'd make the seargant from    Full Metal Jacket  look like Strawberry fucking-Shortcake.  I'd be walking up and down the dugout screaming things like "You may not  like  me, but you will  respect  me because I am  fair ! You are all equally worthless in my eyes!  You, Private FatBoy!  You grounded out with one out and Nomar on second in the ninth inning!  Get down on your knees and choke yourself ---- no, with  my  hand, numbnuts!" And to top it all off, Pokey Reese injured his thumb.  X-rays were negative, but he will be having an MRI to see if/how badly he damaged the ligament.  Great.  Just great. I taped over last night's game for this?

      First of all, I stopped for a beer on my walk home from work and found myself asking the ages-old question, "What's up with the 33 on the Rolling Rock bottles?"  If you're curious like me, here is the  urlLink answer .   Anyway, fun game tonight.  Excellent performance from Schilling.  Ortiz, Manny and Nomar all went yard.  When Nomar came up to bat in the sixth after the Twins intentionally walked Manny to load the bases, Mike said "I know what's going to happen --- fly out to the infield."  I shook my head.  "I don't like the guy, but I'm going to have a little faith right now," I answered, and about two seconds after I said that TradeBait hit a grand slam.  Sox went on to win the game 9-2.  I'd  like  to predict this game as being a sort of turn-around point for the Sox, but again, every time I think this they turn around and lose two in a row just to make sure they build up absolutely no momentum whatsoever.  So we'll see.  You'll pardon me if I remain a skeptic.

      The hot topic lately has been whether or not the Sox are going to try to trade for Beltran, and let me tell you that I am dead-set against this idea.  The last thing the Sox need is another free agent, nor do they need any more offense.  What the Sox need most is another reliable starting pitcher - didn't your mother ever tell you that pitching wins championships, not offense?  I'm not too big on the idea of selling the farm for a rental player.  If the Sox are going to dump good prospects because they're going to go for it all this season, then they need to dump them for someone (i.e. a pitcher,  not  another centerfielder) who is capable of making an immediate impact.  Freddy Garcia, Livan Hernandez (whom I thought the Sox were going for last year when they ended up with fucking Jeff Suppan,) maybe Odalis Perez, but I don't think he'll be up for trade considering that the Dodgers don't exactly have an excess of good starting pitching (Hideo Nomo.) In any case, I would hate to see good prospects like Youkilis and Shoppach get traded away for some three-month moron.  Why don't we just start shopping TradeBait (i.e. Nomar)?  He's bitter, he's angry, he doesn't want to stay, and he wants to be overpaid.  In addition the Sox have a great defensive replacement for him, and I just outright don't like the guy.

       urlLink    Ever wanted to know what the delicate little flower who makes all these entries looks like?  Well here I am! &nbsp; urlLink     See, I told you that I looked like a fourteen year old boy.  ::Shrug::  A face only a mother could love! Sox dropped one to the Giants tonight, 6-4.  I was just looking at the box score of the game (since I didn't get to watch it because of goddamn FOX) and I have to say that I'm sick of Terry Francona.  This guy is a liability.  Zsa Zsa Gabor could make a better line-up than last night's.  Trot, Nomar AND Damon all out at once??  I can see either Trot or Nomar out...but Damon too?  Fucking  moron.  Jesus Christ how are the Sox going to win games like this?  I think the Sox should make me bench coach, and every time I'd see Tito try to put a lineup like that on the field I'd bash one of his toes with a ball peen hammer for every mis-placed player.  I am feeling a little more encouraged by the late-inning rallies that the Sox have been executing.  Makes me think that maybe they are on the verge of good things...but it's hard to really believe that when they can't manage to go on a substantial winning streak.  Maybe on the next homestand... Jason Schmidt vs. Arroyo today.  Say what you want about Arroyo (I know I have) but he's due.  If the offense can keep rolling like it has and Tito doesn't decide to play Crespo, McCarty and Youkilis for Manny, David and Trot then I think we have a real chance to win. We're spending all day on the Ohio river with my parents on their boat today, so we're going to do the poor-man's TiVO and set the vcr timer.  Go Sox!!!!

       urlLink    FatBoy's return.&nbsp; urlLink     I will admit to having a crisis of faith when I got home in the top of the fourth last night, just in time to see Marquis Grissom hit a three-run homer to make the score 7-2.  In disgust I turned over to the Yankees game and go figure, they were winning.  I sat in my chair determined not to watch any more of the Sox game, but I'm like a battered wife for the Red Sox - I just keep coming back for more, no matter how badly they treat me. So I turned back to the game and lo and behold - I was rewarded for my lack of willpower with a  seven run  fifth inning.  Ortiz and Manny went back to back with homeruns, and FatBoy continued the rally with a three-run homer of his own.  At innings end the score was 9-7 Sox.  But the fun didn't stop there.  Nomar and Mirabelli went back-to-back as well, Trot hit one in the ninth, and the final score was 13-9.  It was a very fun game to watch, but my favorite part of the game was something that didn't happen on tv.  My friend Paulie (BucketHead) called me around midnight from PacBell to tell me how great the game was and how drunk he was and how much shit he was talking to Giants fans.  I was green with jealousy.  I guess that pays me back for calling him from Jacob's Field in May to tell him that I was in front row, centerfield getting ready to watch Schilling pitch.  With the Sox having scored 25 runs in the last two games and the Yankees losing back to back games for the first time since 1845, the Sox are now 3.5 back. I would love to watch today's game (Pedro vs. Bonds, plus the added spectacle of Pedro in a batting helmet with his .095 lifetime batting average,) however, stupid goddamn FOXsports has decided to broadcast the Yanks/Dodgers game instead, so even though I paid $150 dollars for the MLB Extra Innings cable package I'm still not going to be able to watch the ONLY FUCKING INTERLEAGUE GAME I've had any interest in.  Bastards.  A pox on them and their families. Schill's ankle is stable and he will be making his next scheduled start on Tuesday at Fenway vs. the Twins.

      Wow - I can't believe I'm saying this but I am pleased as punch to have the opportunity: another great game from Derek Lowe yesterday!  He shut out the Rockies for seven innings and in fact hasn't allowed an earned run in his last fourteen innings. Apparently whatever Mr. Lowe has been doing with the team psychologist has been working.  And the ofense made its weekly appearance last night, scoring 11 runs, 5 of which belonged to David Ortiz.  Papi Grande hit a two run, second-deck homer in addition to 3 other RBIs, which puts him back in the lead over Vladdy for American League ribbie king.  Ortiz is on pace to hit something like 145 RBIs this year - I think everyone can now rest assured that last season wasn't just a "career year," right all you dirty pinstripers?  Trot also had an excellent game, going 2-3 with a double.  In fact, the only person that didn't really have a good game was my boy Manny.  0-4 - ouch. Sox head to San Francisco to take on the Giants and that big mouthed, steroid-abusing cheater Barry Bonds.  (Hey Barry, maybe everyone's not  really  racist, maybe they all just hate  YOU.   I know I do.  I hope you get stripped of all your cheating-ass records, you make me sick, and I mean that honestly and sincerely from the bottom of my fucked-up heart.)  I would like to say that the Sox have some sort of "momentum" going into tonight's game, but knowing them, they probably don't. No word yet on Schill's ankle, although Remy said during the game last night that Schill called Tito from Boston yesterday and said that he felt great, so hopefully that's good news.  I think they are doing the MRI today, so we should know more hopefully by tonight. And in other news, just when I thought I had reached the nadir of my dislike for Nomar, he has to go on another whining campaign, just when the team needs it least.  You know what, Nomar?  I don't care about your goddamn feelings.  If you have something to prove, then shut up and prove it.  Didn't your little league coach ever tell you that there isn't an I in TEAM???  You don't see Trot out there whining about not being given a fair chance.  I'm going to change Nomar's nickname from Mr. Useless to TradeBait.  Get him outta here.   I read that Pedro and Manny were giving Fatso a couple baserunning lessons, naked and fresh out of the shower.  Yowza!  I'm having a really good time imagining what that would look like, but I really wish that I had photographic proof, heehee.

      My baseball hierarchy:  First there are the Red Sox - my beloved baseball team, the best baseball team in the whole wide world, regardless of standings or scoreboards.  Next are two other teams that I lightweight follow, the Cardinals (my hometown team) and the Cincinnati Reds.  Then there other baseball teams that aren't the Red Sox, Cards or, Reds and about whom I feel apathetic, like the White Sox, the Diamondbacks, and the Mets, for example.  And then there are the other  other  teams that I really, really dislike.  These teams fill me with loathing, and above and beyond simply disliking them, I actively root against them and wish only the worst things in life to happen to them.  The Oakland A's, for example.  I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the latter category: the Colorado Rockies.  This shitty team: 1) is named after a state, not a city.  I hate that. 2) has someone named Kit Pellow playing for them. 3) has the most uneccessarily self-congratulatory announcers I have ever heard.  I mean, I thought the YES announcers were bad (and they are, believe me - they are) but at least they have a winning record to back up all the smack they talk. The Rockies blow goats, yet the announcers haven't missed an opportunity to hate on the Red Sox the entire game.  Look, it's not the Sox' fault that your hometown team is so shitty that they draw more fans from an away team.  If you wanna be bitter at someone, be bitter at all the morons who live in Denver who never go to games because that franchise smokes dick. 4) Royce Clayton is one of the ugliest players in baseball. 5) if you conjugate the verb "to suck," each tense applies to the Rockies franchise history: sucks, has sucked, is sucking. And speaking of sucking, the Sox are a fucking mess.  What in the mother-fuck is wrong with this team?  I'm not even going to write about it, as I would just be repeating myself from last night. Trot homered in his second at-bat tonight.  I found myself unconsciously grinning widely when I saw him step into the batter's box for the first time!  I'm so excited to have him back in the lineup!  Now we won't have to see so many at-bats by FatBoy - although Tito decided to pinch hit him tonight and guess what, he struck out. Last year when the team was down late in the innings, I always felt like they were going to come back, even if there were only two outs left in the game.  This year, when they trail in late innings, it just seems like they're dead in the water.  I don't even want to watch anymore if they're still losing by the sixth. What in the fuck is going on?  (Note: right after I got done typing that they scored two runs in the ninth, but they still managed to lose the game so fuck em.)  I guess we'll find out about Schill's ankle tomorrow or the next day.  He had a dicey start tonight, I hope that wasn't the cause of it.  Fuck the Rockies.

      Maybe the Sox would like to leave one more fucking man on base tonight.  Fucking disgusting.  I'm tired of watching this shit.  1)Tito, in all his infinite wisdom, puts KEVIN MILLAR in the fucking THREE HOLE and benches Ortiz.  2) Sox leave the bases loaded THREE FUCKING TIMES, once with no outs --- how in the fuck does that happen???  3) Little Richard could strike Jason Varitek out.  4)  So help me God I don't want to hear any excuses about the altitude.  The team fucking botched it.  If Trot weren't coming back tomorrow I'd be tempted not to watch the game at all.  When is this mystic "spark" that the Sox are supposed to receive from the return of Trot and Nomar supposed to happen?  Could someone send me a telegram so that I can tune in during that game, cause I'm tired of watching this half-ass garbage.   Four and a half games back.  If the Sox keep playing like this they don't deserve to win the division.  Please, Theo, tell us you have something up your sleeve!  I can't take the disappointment!  ....Okay, it was an angry rant.  I'm over it.  Of course I'll watch the game tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day.  But am I worried?  You bet your bottom dollar I am. Feel free to throw this entry back in my face when I'm raving about how well the team is doing in a couple of entries.  Okay, think positive, think positive.....  Do you, as a Sox fan, ever feel like you're on that freaky boat ride in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, only instead of Gene Wilder at the helm it's Terry Francona and you're sitting there clutching frantically to Manny Ramírez who's more scared than you are and right next to you is Anastacio Martínez who's shrieking like a little girl -- only Francona doesn't actually have any ability to stop and/or control the boat and is actually just along for the tour like you are? Cause I do.

       urlLink    Big ups to Pokey!  Sox beat Dodgers 4-1, win second straight interleague series.&nbsp; urlLink     Tonight was a very fun game to watch.  Mike and I ran across the street to the convenience store to buy junkfood and malt liquor, I took a quick bath and by the time I was out the game was on.  Pedro gave up a run in the first inning, but the Sox quickly made it up in the bottom of the first thanks to an RBI single from Manny.  After about six pitches from Nomo I was already tired of watching his queer-ass wind up.  In the fourth or fifth inning (I can't remember so sue me) the Sox scored three runs, two of which came as a result of a wall-ball double by Pokey Reese.  And if that weren't enough, Pokey had an absolutely amazing catch to end the seventh inning and more than likely save Pedro's win.  I swear to god it looked like he jumped about three feet into the air to grab a line drive by Roberts.  Pokey is the man, you can believe that.  Once Nomar gets up to speed you won't be able to drive a golf ball through the infield.   The thing I loved most about tonight was to see another strong outing by Pedro.  Once again, his curveball was filthy, and he was able to hit up to 94 mph with his fastball.  At times it seemed like he struggled a little bit with his location, but in true Pedro fashion he was able to come through when it counted.  And I always love to see Pokey have a good game.  The Sox seemed relaxed and happy tonight - I think good things are right around the corner. Speaking of good things, Trot will be joining the Sox on their road trip to Colorado and may be activated as soon as Wednesday!  Whoopeeeee!  Oh, and almost forgot to mention that I read on Yahoo that the Sox shopped Derek Lowe to the Padres for Adam Eaton, but that the Padres weren't biting.  Guess we know one free agent that won't be back in 2005.

      Well, last night was a total debacle, apparently.  I didn't watch the game.  I carefully avoided all forms of media so that I could go home and watch the tape of the game and be surprised by the outcome, but (fortunately) when I walked into the living room the score was on the bottom of the television screen and I quickly had to make other plans for the evening's entertainment. I predict that Pedro is going to have a good game tonight against the Dodger.  I don't believe that Nomo has been doing that great this year, so hopefully the offense can do it's thing.  I'm also in agreement with my husband that Bellhorn is due for a big day soon, hopefully tonight!

       urlLink    Orteezy fer sheezy!&nbsp; urlLink     Good game tonight.  Dare I say it but Derek Lowe and Odalis Perez were battling each other in what turned out to be a surprising pitching duel - let me tell you, that was the last thing I expected to sit down and watch when I got home from work tonight.  Both offenses were pretty much non-existent until Ortiz hit a home run in the bottom of the seventh inning.  Timlin pitched a scoreless eighth and Foulke came in in the ninth.  Game over, right?  Not so fast. Cue the calliope music, somebody, cause the baseball is headed toward Manny.  The shut-out and Derek Lowe's win were both thrown out the window after Manny failed to catch a routine fly ball (Remy and Orsillo tried to blame it on the wind, but after a replay of the flags in left-center field it was established that "Manny botched it.  That ball should be caught every time.")  But no matter - Ortiz came through again with a game-winning single that scored Damon from third.  I love Manny to death - I really do - if someone put a gun to my head and made me pick a favorite member of the 2004 Red Sox it would be Manny, no doubt about it - but he really sucked tonight.  Three ground-outs (one into a double play) and an error.  Irritating. But in the end it was an entertaining game, and in light of the pistol-whipping that the Yankees received at the hands of the Padres tonight, it was something to celebrate. Wakey tomorrow and then Sweet P. starts on sunday, so we'll be able to watch it live!  Last year it seemed like we were always off on Wakefield's starts.  This year it seems to be Pedro, which is a-okay with me. Good to see Derek Lowe have a good game.  I'm off to play some MVP 2005 with my husband.  Good night.

       Curse of the Bumbino.  My husband and I were walking into our apartment the other day after eating lunch at the bomb-ass Cuban restaurant down the street when some crackhead bum walked by and asked us for some money.  After telling him no, like we always do, the bum asked "Are you really Boston fans?"  Mike and I were both wearing batting-practice model Sox hats and Mike had a Patriots t-shirt on - the bum must have been a rocket scientist or something. The bum was like "I'm sorry for you guys, that team ain't never gonna win shit, you ain't never gonna win  shit! "  Maybe so, but at least I have a fucking  house  and a  job  at which I earn my  own money . Anyway.  Mr. Useless returns.  Trot about a week away.  Williamson's return appears to be imminent...things are looking up!!!  Unfortunately I haven't been able to watch the past two games because I'm an idiot.  Once I forgot to set the VCR, and tonight I left a public library copy of "Julian Donkey Boy" by Harmony Korine in the VCR and I'm $80 dollars lucky that it didn't get recorded over.   By the way, regarding Nomar.  I know that it's not particularly "in fashion" to talk ill of Nomar now that everyone wants to slob his knob because he hasn't played all year, but I've never been one to cave into fashion (just take a look in my closet if you want proof.)  So Nomar's back - whoop-dee-friggin-doo.  I'm going to buy one of those gizmos that the coaches use to keep track of pitch counts and use it to record the number of times that guy pops out.  I might even get two and keep track of how many times he walks.  Which gizmo do you think will get the biggest work-out??  I look to Nomar's return to give the team a shot in the arm and - let's face it - more offensive reliability than, say, Cesar Crespo.  Having Nomar back for the rest of this season definitely isn't a bad thing. But I neither expect nor want this guy back on the team in 2005.  Some Boston writer - I think it was Tony Massarotti - was saying how now Red Sox Nation knows what it will be like without Nomar, trying to work my heartstrings.  Please.  Ya, life without Nomar has been a real nightmare - the Sox only have the second best record in the AL and have had the best defensive shortstop in the league as well, woe is us, what shall we do.  Let some other team overpay that schlub.

      I don't call it the Rally Cuff for nothing.  John Frakes and I wore a special rally cuff during service tonight just for Pedro, and lo and behold - an excellent game!  Pedro was the Sweet P. of yore that we all know and love - not the colostomy-bag-wearing prison bitch that we witnessed in his last outing.  Sweet P. went 8 innings with eight strikeouts, one walk, one hit batter and 2 hits.  And, as much as I hate to compliment him, Shamu didn't do a bad job either, considering that it was his first start back off the DL. Keith Foulke picked up his thirteenth (I'm pretty sure) save of the season in a 1-2-3 ninth inning. Johnny Damon got the sole RBI of the game.  The Sox out-hit the Padres, yet continue to leave a lot of men on base.  This problem has been very frustrating, but I'm hoping that once everyone is healthy and playing at their full capability (perhaps by the All Star break???) that problem will be minimized. As Pedro was walking off the field after the eighth, my husband happened to comment how Pedro might resent everyone cheering him now after talking so much shit about him when he wasn't pitching well.  My response: who gives a rat's ass?  Pedro talks more shit than anyone else on that team, so I don't particularly care about his feelings.  Just his pitching lines.  Perhaps the side session on Saturday helped him out - I'll be very interested to watch his next start, which will come against the Dodgers at Fenway.  Mr. Useless is still not with the team.  (That's the REAL Mr. Useless, Nomar, not the fill-in Mr. Useless, Gabe Kapler, who will become Mrs. Useless when/if Nomar ever plays.)  And has anyone heard  anything  about Trot?  He's the player I miss the most. In any case, a very fun game to watch tonight.  Hopefully it will set the tone for the rest of the homestand.

      I've decided that since it is an off-day, I'm going to make an off topic post.  Well, first I'd like to announce a new addition to my "5 Favorite Red Sox" list:   Mark Bellhorn , congratulations!  You are now one of my top five favorite Red Sox players!  Even though you strike out a lot, you are getting your fair share of walks, RBIs and clutch hits.  You're no slouch on defense, you wear your socks high, and you look eerily similar to my friend Josh Lowe.  So congratulations to Mark Bellhorn for earning a much-coveted spot on my Top 5 Favorite Sox Players list.  Speaking of Bellhorn, has anyone seen that guy smile ever?  My husband and I were just talking about this the other day - we've never seen his facial expression change one iota.  Mark Bellhorn is the new Todd Walker.  Only cooler.  And Bellhorn doesn't look like Kevin Nealon's mini-me. Off topic:  here are some books I have just finished, I am reading right now, or I am about to read - Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut, Candide by Voltaire, Women by Charles Bukowski (which I actually only made it 3/4 of the way through before it got so repetetive that I had to put it away) and Conversations with the Capeman by Richard Jacoby. Off topic:  the cicada infestation has finally made it's way to downtown Cincinnati, and I must say that those bugs are too dumb to live more than one month every seventeen years.  I'm glad they will all be dead again in a week or two. Off topic:  When my cell phone rings, it plays "In Da Club" by 50 Cent. The Song of the Day today is "Here Comes Your Man" by the Pixies.  So many bands ripped the Pixies off that it's almost hard to remember how original they were at one point in time.  I remember listening to this song when I was in my very early teens and not understanding what it was about.  Now I know that it is about waiting for a drug dealer.  Being an adult means finding out a bunch of stuff you never wanted to know, which is precisely why I refuse to grow up.

       urlLink    I blame it on Crespo.  &nbsp; urlLink     His suckiness is evidently contagious.  Perhaps, like Pigpen from the old Peanuts cartoon, an aura of suck just surrounds him wherever he goes, and today Grimmsley and Harvey just happened to run through (and collide in) the cloud.  In any case, the Sox managed to get another win today, thanks to a five-run fifth inning.  The Sox were finally able to make the Royals pay for all the base-on-balls they had been giving up, and Timlin/Foulke were able to close the game out quite efficiently.  I can't believe I'm about to say this, but Derek Lowe didn't do half badly today, by his own garbage-y standards.  He cut his usual runs-given-up-per-game in half today, only giving up three over five innings, and at one point had retired something like nine batters in a row.  (Don't you just love how vague I am while writing about a sport in which numbers are God?)  Maybe it was the high socks.  Sox have tomorrow off and then will start interleague play with a series against the Padres, which I believe will feature Pedro vs. that fat, beached walrus David Wells.  There are also rumors going around that Nomar will make his first appearance of the season on Tuesday, but who knows.  Mr. Useless.

      (please let me preface this entry by saying that it is full of nothing but hateful negativity and ranting and that in no way does it reflect the love that I really feel for this team or individual players, some of whom appear on my desktop as wallpaper and whose baseball cards are hung up on my station at work.)  urlLink    Pedro shits the bed.  Again.&nbsp; urlLink     On the second day of June señor Martínez gave to me: Eleven hits, Seven earned runs, 5 fucking innings, 4 measley strikeouts, 2 base-on-balls, One hit batter And a 4.40 ERAaaaaaaaaaaaa!  I'm pissed.  And I'm worried.  I probably wouldn't be so pissed if I weren't so worried.  Pedro just isn't the Sweet P. that we all know and love.  He looked bad last night, and I'm past the point where I'm letting him off with the "settling into the season" excuse.  Pedro keeps insisting that he is healthy, that he's just having problems locating pitches and this & that, but wtf??  I never thought the problem this year would be pitching.   First we've got Pedro, the Stepford Dominican, who looks the same and acts the same (i.e. talking a bunch of shit, which he has thusfar been unable to back up [ya, just keep telling us the management is spreading "untrue" "rumors" about your shoulder being held together with Stick-um and a Post-It note]) but who just isn't the same.  Then we've got Schilling, who I keep hearing is bothered by an ankle problem, although I'm not sure whether this is true or not.  Next is Wakefield, who - as fucked up as this is - kinda looks like the team ace right now.  Wakey's a knuckleballer, and he's almost always going to give up a certain amount of hits and/or runs, but he has looked like the most consistent pitcher of the bunch.  Then Lowe.  Wow.  Derek Lowe.  No comment.  And the fifth pitcher is either a) alternately brilliant and angeringly incompetant, or b) off doing God-knows-what God-knows-where, depending on whether you view Arroyo or Kim as the fifth starter.  Add to this mess a complete fucking moron of a manager who has a Gradian concept of pulling pitchers and you get...you get...well, you get a team that is 2.5 games behind first place, has nine fucking players on the DL, and is about to embark on one of the toughest months of their season.   Just ducky. Not to mention Gabe Kapler, who has filled in nicely as a substitute Mr. Useless until the  real  Mr. Useless comes back on Tuesday (at least we probably won't have to endure another at-bat from goddamn Cesar Crespo;) Manny Ramírez, who - as much as I love him and still hold him dear as my favorite Red Sox - is looking like he's chilling in a Barcalounger watching the Spice Channel with a Gameboy Advance and a 22 of Presidente beer on the basepaths as well as out in left field these days; Kevin "the Rally Killer" Millar, Brian "I look completely joyless even after I hit a homerun because even I am aware of how bad I suck" Daubach, and me, Sarah "I'm a fairweather fan who can't endure a couple of losses without thinking that the season is already over and we might as well roll over and take it in the ass from the Yankees like we always do" Martin.  Hehe.  ::wink:: :)

       urlLink    For Pete's sake...&nbsp; urlLink     I'm turning off the television right now.  Right  now.   There, it's off.  It's the bottom of the seventh, one out, Keith Foulke just took the mound, and the score is 9-7.  I'm not watching another single second of this bullshit.  The first four innings of the game were pretty much spent in a contest to see which starting pitcher could suck the meanest dick. The first inning, two-run homer from Vlad seemed to give Pedro the early jump in this category, but ultimately Washburn proved to be worst (or best, depending on how you view being a complete and utter pole-smoker,) and was pulled from the game with the Sox on top 7-4.  Then Tito -  once again,  might I add - completely mismanaged his pitching staff and sent an obviously gassed Pedro (who had very little to start the game and had absolutely nothing to offer by the sixth inning,) back out on the mound in classic Grady Little fashion.  7-5.  Then bring on Mike Timlin, and  presto!  - the score is 8-7.  Really fucking brilliant. I'm sick and tired of Mike Timlin, I'm sick and tired of Terry Francona, and I'm sick and tired of watching Pedro looking like he spent more time prepping his goddamn jerri-curl than prepping for the game.  Can the man  get  out of the first inning of a game without giving up at  least  one run??? One good thing - Manny hit another homerun tonight - I think it was his 15th of the season and the 362nd of his career.  And that's about the only good thing I have to say right now.

      A good start for the series - Sox take first game from the Twins 8-2, thanks in large part to an excellent outing by Bronson Arroyo. Over seven and a third innings Arroyo gave up two runs, six hits and no walks while striking out eight...and all that with the flu. Arroyo's curveball was simply filthy. Doug Mientkewicz was responsible for driving in both of Minnesota's runs. Apparently Kyle Lohse is the Derek Lowe of the Twins starting rotation - last year he won 14 games, up until August this year his record is 4-7, and he gives up more hits than David Justice coming home to a dirty house after a long road trip. I know it's hard to be considered "lucky" when you get charged with six or seven runs, but Lohse is lucky that the Sox are batting a terrible .231 with the bases loaded since that schmuck loaded the bases three times. The Sox stranded nine players last night. Their July/August .231 average with the bases loaded is a lot better than the .189 average they had in May or June, but it still sucks. I mean, it's getting to the point where I don't even really expect them to score with the bases loaded unless it's Ortiz or (gulp) Millar at bat. Ricky Gutierrez ground into TWO double plays last night. And I don't want to get too bitch-heavy in a post after the Sox win a game...but what in the nightmare is wrong with Manny lately?? (And I'm not just talking about the awful dreads he's sporting now...yeeesh...I'm suspending his "Hottest Player on the Team" status until he loses that 'do.) I mean, except for two put-outs in left field last night, Manny could've just been replaced by a mannequin with a dead octopus on it's head and no one could tell by glancing at a scorecard. Two strikeouts (one looking,) a fly out to centerfield, a completely meaningless basehit, and a double play line-out to third. Logically I know that he'll pull out of it soon. But man is it frustrating. Coming up big in last night's game was Gabe "Sarah Might Need to Find Me Another Nickname" Krapler,  who was 3-5 with 2 RBI and a fantastic play from right to rob Twins rookie Morneau of a triple.  Tek also had a great game: 3-4 with one walk, one homer, and two runs scored.  My boy Mark Bellhorn did about exactly as I usually expect him to: 1-4 with a walk and two strikeouts.  This series with the Twins is about to get tougher.  Lowe and Radke will be pitching tonight, and then on Sunday will be Pedro vs. Santana, which I'm really excited about watching. I guess Jason Giambi has some sort of benign tumor in an undisclosed area, according to the Yankees and ESPN.  Perhaps it involves the leg into which he's been shooting all his steroids the past few years, or possibly his balls which are probably literally and figuratively the size of pine nuts.  Ya, I made fun of a sick man.  He's not dying, so I figure that it's open season again. Everyone is appealing their suspensions from last Saturdays game.  I'm sort of tired of this subject, so I'm not going to dwell on it except for saying that Remy and Orsillo were really ripping on A-Rod during the game last night, saying that he tried to play a tough-guy routine that he really couldn't pull off.  A-Rod is crying like a baby with a shitty diaper about the whole thing, I'm glad he got his ass beat and had a bruise the size of a grapefruit on his fucking temple after that game, and I hope he slips and falls on a sharp rock.  Alex, you're far too pretty to be tough, and you really gave yourself no chance when you decided to provoke Thunder Thighs Tek, so sit down, shut up, and take it like a man.  Typical Yankee whining...I guess he fits right in over there.

      Arroyo (3-7, 4.20 ERA) vs. Lohse (4-7, 4.87 ERA) tonight in Minnesota. Looking ahead to August, the Sox play seven games against the D-Rays, seven games against the Tigers and six games against the Blue Jays.&nbsp; Time to make some hay while the sun is shining.&nbsp; I want to say that the Sox should be able to come out of the month with a significant improvement in the WC standings - perhaps even the divisional standings, too.&nbsp; But with the way this team has played since the middle of May (sloppy, half-heartedly, incosistently, underachievingly, whatever,) I can't quite convince myself that it will be so.&nbsp; I mean, would it really surprise anybody if they went one or two games over .500 in August?&nbsp; Depressing. Yet I'm looking forward to tonight's game - I haven't watched a Sox game since Pedro pitched in Baltimore, and I'm experiencing withdrawal.&nbsp; C'mon Sox!&nbsp; Please prove me wrong, PLEASE!

       urlLink    A picture of the kitchen I work in. That's Dave the sous chef there on the right, and in the distance are Frakes and Nicole, the meat cooks. This is my home away from home.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    This is my deranged station partner, Jonathan, posing in what we refer to as our "office." It's actually one of the downstairs walk-ins, but we go in there to talk because it's nice and cold.&nbsp; urlLink     It's an off day for the Sox, so I'm off topic.  Work was boring tonight, but I love what I do.  We got in fresh abalone today - it was the first time I've gotten an opportunity to work with it, and it was pretty neat.  Abalone are gastropod mollusks, and they come in still alive so that when you touch the abductor muscle it moves and ripples underneath your fingers.  They're sort of a bitch to clean, and I kept popping open their shit veins, but it was still exciting to play with something new.  That's the really cool thing about working the fish station - we might not be as busy as the meat cooks during service, but we get way more interesting protein than they do.  I'm waiting to get eel in one day.  When those things are alive you have to bash their heads on the table, then nail their heads to the wall and peel their skins off straight down, or so I'm told...I've sliced and cut and boiled a lot of things to death, but I've never had to bash anything.  And to think that I was a vegetarian for five years. I watched John Kerry's acceptance speech tonight.  It was alright.  He's no Bill Clinton though, as far as speech-making goes, but he's also not an insane, fundamentalist war mongering murderer either.  At least he has that going for him. Best part of the speech was when CNN accidentally aired the microphone of the guy who was in charge of releasing all the balloons and confetti at the end: "More balloons, I need more balloons to fall! Not enough balloons!  Jesus!  Where's the confetti?  What the hell are you guys doing up there?"  Priceless. CD of the week:  "Either/Or" by Elliott Smith.  Soft, sensitive, indie-type songwriters aren't usually my thing, but I like Elliott Smith.  A lot.  And how soft and mushy can you be if you commit suicide by stabbing yourself in the heart? Yowza.   Sox take on the Twins tomorrow in Minnesota.  I'm going to bed.

       urlLink     The view from our seats yesterday, right behind first base. That's Pujols at bat again, I think.&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink     This is the kind of sophmoric photo you get after you do way too many Jag-bombs at the bar before the game. (By the way, that's my buddy Frakes.)&nbsp; urlLink       urlLink     My husband who, after a long night on the town, actually starts to kind of resemble Mark Bellhorn. Scary. (That's my Pats jersey he's wearing. Grrrrrrr.)&nbsp; urlLink     I saw my first live grand slam last night off of the bat of pinch-hitter Barry Larkin.&nbsp; That was really cool.&nbsp; I also saw my boy Wily Mo Peña rob a home run out in centerfield - that was probably the best play I've ever seen in person.&nbsp; (I wish that Wily Mo and Jose Acevedo were on the Sox, they're the only two Reds players I like and I feel sort of bad for them being stuck in this town on this team.)&nbsp; I also got the opportunity to heckle that cheesy fraud Gabe White, who gave up a homerun, a double, and a basehit to the first three batters of his "relief" appearance.&nbsp; All in all it was a good night, but I&nbsp; just wish I didn't drink quite so much. And the closest I got to watching the Sox game last night was watching the scoreboard at the Great American ballpark.&nbsp; That game went FAST.&nbsp; When the Reds game was in the third inning, the Sox/Orioles game was already in the sixth.&nbsp; And what the fuck is up with Manny???&nbsp; He burned me on Sunday night - my husband and I each picked a player who we thought would have a good game.&nbsp; I'm like "Manny's definitely due."&nbsp; He sucked.&nbsp; Who did my husband pick?&nbsp; Johnny "Three-Run Homer" Damon.&nbsp; He picked it up a little in that first game against the Orioles, but then K'd three times LOOKING last night.&nbsp; God damn.

       urlLink    Why I like Mark Bellhorn.&nbsp; urlLink    Yes, I understand that he strikes out a lot of &nbsp;the time - many times without even taking the bat off his shoulder.&nbsp; And he sometimes makes errors that make you want to grab the nearest baby and shake it.&nbsp; (Like whenever he wasted a perfectly good Manny throw to let whatever scumbag Yankee it was get on second base last Sunday.)&nbsp; And I had to put my own wallet in my mouth to keep from strangling on my own tongue during that short span of time when he was playing third base.&nbsp; But in spite of all that,&nbsp; even though he'll probably never bat .300, &nbsp;for some reason, humble little Mark Bellhorn is one of my favorite 2004 Red Sox. For one thing, I have a soft spot in my heart for the regular&nbsp;guys that just put their heads down and play hard and with a lot of sincerity,&nbsp;you know - the Trot Nixons and Bill Muellers of the world.&nbsp; They may not be the most talented ballplayers in the world, they may not be especially easy on the eyes, but they give you everything they've got.&nbsp; I think Bellhorn definitely falls into this category.&nbsp; I like the underdogs. And hey, he leads the AL in walks.&nbsp; (Unless he's been overtaken by Frank Thomas.)&nbsp; He can hit for power.&nbsp; He's shown flashes of being clutch.&nbsp; And he just seems like a goddamn decent guy, even though he sometimes has a sort of glazed, heroin-nod sort of look on his face that kind of makes you think you might be able to bounce a brick off his cranium without really disturbing him too much.&nbsp; I like how he wears his socks high.&nbsp; I like his Fisher Price "My First Batting Gloves and Cleats" set he uses.&nbsp; I like his designer beard stubble that gives you the temporary impression that he might be a scary Floridian meth addicted truck driver until you look closer and realize that it's just the way he grooms himself.&nbsp; And I like how no matter what he does in the course of a ball game, you never see him change his facial expression.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; His entertainment value to me is quite high. So Mr. Bellhorn, I don't care what everyone else says, you're alright with me, kiddo.&nbsp; I'd party with&nbsp;Mark any day of the week.  In other news - while Pedro didn't exactly say that he was out of the woods on his hip injury thingy, he sounded sure that he will be making his next start, which would keep me from laying in bed staring up at the ceiling and imagining new and improved ways for Terry Francona to get hit by a bus for at least one night.&nbsp;&nbsp; And while Pedro looks kind of cute in those baggy pants he's been pitching in lately - sort of like a little kid wearing pajamas or wearing one of his father's suits - I wish he'd go back to the skin tight ones.&nbsp; I mean, that's just bonus - I get to watch Pedro pitch, AND I get to watch his wonderful, tight posterior in various acrobatic movements as captured by my friend the centerfield camera. Sox game got rained out last night, which is actually kind of cool since they were losing 4-2.&nbsp; Apparently Wakey is still bothered by that line drive that drilled him in the back of the shoulder a week and a half ago.&nbsp; Deep bruising around the scapula.&nbsp; Ugh. Alright, I'm headed down to the ballpark for the 7:05 Cards/Reds game.&nbsp; Adios.&nbsp; Go Sox!

       Lots of good things. &nbsp; Sox win their third game in a row, 12-5 against the dreaded Baltimore Orioles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sox offense continues to roll on, with Manny finally waking up and going 3-4 with two singles, a double, and 2 RBI.&nbsp; Ortiz had another good day (1-2 with two RBI, two walks and a hit-by-pitch,) and Varitek drove in three runs.&nbsp; Pedro looked positively filthy in the first five innings - and I'm not just talking about the grease dripping off of his jerri-curl.&nbsp; He gave up a two-run homer to Tejada in the sixth, then left in the seventh with a "tweaked hip," two men on base and a runner scored.&nbsp; In the end, thanks to the less than stellar relief by Terry Adams, Pedro was charged with 5 earned runs over 6 and a third.&nbsp;&nbsp; (By the way, who is Karim Garcia?&nbsp; The dumbass who went 0-3 against Pedro last night, that's who.) Mendoza looks pretty damn good as well.&nbsp; I know that it might be a little too soon to get too excited about this guy as it seems that he can injure himself making waffles in the morning, but if he&nbsp;ends up maintaining this level of performance it could be&nbsp;huge for the Red Sox. I noticed something really funny in the dugout last night.&nbsp; At work we wear the same ballcaps all the time, and a pathetic amount of kitchen conversation has revolved around whose hat smells the worst.&nbsp; Hats will be brandished and sniffed, or someone will run up and just shove their hat over your face - things like that.&nbsp; At the end of the game last night I noticed Curt Shilling and some other player  trading and smelling each other's hats. &nbsp; Humans are weird animals, aren't we?  I was going to write more, but the Pedro Martínez Sports Century is on and then I have to go to work.&nbsp; Go Wakey!&nbsp; Go Sox!

       urlLink    MFYs get burned 9-6, Sox take best out of three.&nbsp; urlLink     Wow, what a series. Mike and I bought and downloaded Saturday's game off&nbsp;of MLB.com and watched it in it's entirety yesterday afternoon --- I might have had a stroke had I watched that game live.&nbsp; Best game of the season - not necessarily in terms of  play , but definitely in terms of excitement.&nbsp; Then Mike and I took our traditional Sunday nap (days off are wonderful and glorious things,) and woke up for the series finale on, ugh, Sunday Night Baseball. The Yanks jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead in the top of the first inning, thanks largely to a temporarily&nbsp;lethargic Sox defense.&nbsp; Lofton got all the way to second on what should have been a single had Damon not been asleep on his feet.&nbsp; Jeter sacrificed Lofton to third on a bunt, Sheffield scored Lofton with a basehit, Rodriguez got a cheap infield single, Posada was hit by a pitch (good,) and Matsui scored Sheffield from third on a sac-fly to deep center.&nbsp; The next batter, Bernie Williams, was retired on a fly-out to Manny and I'm thinking uh-oh, things don't look good for Lowe...bad defense and too many fly-balls do not a good sinkerball pitcher make. But apparently I was underestimating the power of Contreras's suckitude.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sox came right back to score two of their own in the bottom of the first, with Bellhorn and Ortiz (both walked) scored on a single from none other than Kevin Millar.&nbsp; For once this team was able to make a pitcher pay for issuing too many walks. Sox had a four run fourth, with Damon and Bellhorn going deep back-to-back with three-run and single-run homers respectively, padding the lead to 6-2.&nbsp; The score went to 7-2 in the fifth thanks to a homerun by....Kevin Millar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two more runs were scored in the&nbsp; sixth inning - Bellhorn doubled and was driven in by Ortiz, who also doubled, and scored from third on an RBI single from....guess who!&nbsp; Kevin Millar!!&nbsp; The score was then 9-2....but it just wouldn't be the Red Sox if they let the game end that easily. For ONCE Terry Francona pulled Derek Lowe at the first sign of trouble, not after he'd already given up four runs.&nbsp; With two out and two men on base, Francona pulled Lowe and put in Mike Timlin, who promptly walked Posada and gave up a grand slam to Matsui.&nbsp; Just terrific.&nbsp; Score is now 9-6.&nbsp; I believe it was the newly aquired Terry Adams who got the final out of that inning.&nbsp; The Yanks threatened to score again in the eighth in the strangest play of the series:&nbsp; Jeter hit a low line drive that bounced off of Keith Foulke's foot or shin right back to Mirabelli, who nailed Jeter in the back (good) as he tried to throw him out at first.&nbsp; Enrique Wilson had come around to score from third, but was sent back after the homeplate umpire called Jeter out because he was inside the first base line.&nbsp;  urlLink Joe Torre said &nbsp;that "it's a silly rule because you have to come back on that side to touch the bag."&nbsp; Well, maybe, but you don't have to  run all the way down the frickin basepath  on the inside and block a throw.&nbsp; In any case, Keith Foulke got the five outs he needed to save the game and we all lived happily ever after.  urlLink Unfortunately ,&nbsp; Trot is back on the DL because of his quad - no relation to the brawl on Saturday night.&nbsp; Sounds pretty serious.&nbsp; Varitek also missed last night's game due to soreness in his wrist which he speculated was directly related to the brawl, but there is a good chance that he will be back in the lineup tonight in Baltimore. I'd like to take this opportunity to publically apologize to Kevin Millar, about whom I have made several disparaging comments over the past month.&nbsp; Your defense is still pretty dodgy, Kevin, but they couldn't have done it without you!

       urlLink     I live for this.&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;  &nbsp;"Varitek took the first swat at Rodriguez, the highest-paid player in the game, then hit him flush in the middle of the face with an open hand..."&nbsp; (from the Globe.)&nbsp; I ask you, who  hasn't  dreamt of bitch-slapping that smug little prick?&nbsp;  Of course, thanks to the Fox network, I missed the best game of the season thus-far, but we watched all the highlights about 4 times on ESPN.&nbsp; Watching A-Rod get his silly little ass beat is nothing short of a dream come true.&nbsp; And Bill Mueller's walk-off homer off of "Mr. Sandman" Rivera looked beautiful.&nbsp; If I had been watching that game live I probably would have gotten teary.  And here all through work tonight I kept telling my buddy John Frakes that it was all over.&nbsp; (Frakes and I have a beautiful partnership wherein he roots for the Red Sox and I root for the UK college basketball team.)&nbsp; "Check the score," he tells me.&nbsp; "I can't pull my cellphone out during the middle of service!" I squeal, "And besides, they were already losing during dinner break, face it, it's over."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Check the goddamn score!"&nbsp; Frakes insists.&nbsp; So I mosey back on down to fish station and as secretly as possible, I get onto the internet on my cellphone and check the score...10-8 in the ninth inning.&nbsp; I check the clock.&nbsp; It's eight-something.&nbsp; What the hell is taking this game so long??&nbsp; I triumphantly march back down to meat station and tell Frakes "HA!&nbsp; 10-8 in the ninth!&nbsp; See?&nbsp; I TOLD you so!"&nbsp; Frakes shakes his head.&nbsp; "Cuff your pants up!" he tells me, brandishing his own rallycuff at me.&nbsp; "No, the rally cuff is dead, this is between god and the Red Sox and god is pissed!"&nbsp; I yell, attracting some unwanted attention from the sous chef.&nbsp; We lower our voices.&nbsp; Frakes&nbsp;looks sternly at me:&nbsp;"Look, you're the one that got me into this, now cuff up your fucking pants, I think Bellhorn's going to hit a dinger."&nbsp; I walk off grumbling back down to fish station, but I do cuff my pants up, and lo and behold, next time I check my phone the score is written as follows:&nbsp; NYY-10BOS-11F.&nbsp; "Shame on me!"&nbsp; I shout down to Frakes.&nbsp; "Shame on me!" Why does this team keep doing this to me?&nbsp; I was all set the other day to watch the rest of the season in a stoic, emotionless bliss - sort of like the Boy in the Baseball Bubble.&nbsp; Now I am being suckered in again.&nbsp; It's like I want to keep on hating them but I just can't.&nbsp; I should just be realistic and forget last night even happened and look forward to more errors, blown saves, and three strikeouts in a row with the bases loaded...but there is still a tiny kernel of hope inside me that believes that this could still be the year, that is secretly imagining things like "win streaks" and "offensive outbursts" and "momentum" and&nbsp;"shutout games," that is remembering all the heroics of late last season, even though I know full well that the 2004 Red Sox are an entirely different animal...  The Face vs. Jose Contreras tonight on Sunday night baseball.

       urlLink     Off work early on a Friday night, just in time to watch the game!!! Can you believe that??? Go Sox!!!&nbsp; urlLink       6th inning: &nbsp; I went home early for this???&nbsp; Fucking Kevin Millar couldn't catch a goddamn cold, Schilling suddenly became the Yankees prison-bitch...Fuck this team.&nbsp; This is why they're not getting anywhere near the post season.&nbsp; What a bunch of assholes.  (later)...Okay, so Millar just hit his second homer of the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;Big deal.&nbsp; The 2003 Red Sox would&nbsp;make an amazing comeback...the 2004 Red Sox are dead in the water.&nbsp; When they make their next cute little movie, that should be the title.&nbsp; "Dead in the Water, the 2004 Red Sox."&nbsp;    top of the 8th:  hmmm....7-6 MFY now...goddamn Manny grounding into his millionth double play (13th, second in the league)... Leskanic up....    middle of the 8th: &nbsp; crazy-ass Leskanic pitches 1-2-3 inning with Rivera warming up in the bullpen.&nbsp; I'm torn between praying to a non-existant god or just drinking more beer to kill the pain...    top of the 9th: &nbsp; Millar, I take it back.&nbsp; Three homers in this game, the score tied at 7-7......Foulke blows another save.&nbsp; Go-fucking-figure.&nbsp; 8-7 now, with the big bats due up against Rivera.&nbsp; I'm glad I drank that beer.    Game summary:&nbsp;  Another inexcusable loss for the Sox.&nbsp; Of all things, I didn't expect a complete and total breakdown from Schilling, but it happened.&nbsp; (Whatever happened to "watching this team kick a lot of asses over the next few games," huh??)&nbsp; The Sox battled back more than I expected, but to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp; In true 2004 Red Sox fashion they had back-to-back strikeouts to end the eighth inning with men on second and third and the score tied at 7.&nbsp; In-ex-cusable.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm so goddamn tired of this.&nbsp; It's getting to the point where I  almost &nbsp; don't want to watch anymore.&nbsp; I just need to give up all hope, it will make it all so much easier....If I just never expect them to win then it won't bother me so much when they lose, right?  Manny in particular turned in another piss-poor performance, his third in a row -&nbsp;2 strikeouts, one groundout into a double play and a fly-out.&nbsp; Trot was 1-4 with a run scored, and the cringe-inducing offensive combination of Gutierrez and Bellhorn was 0-3, with Bellhorn managing to reach first base on a fielder's choice.  Ortiz hits two triples in a game?&nbsp; Big deal.&nbsp; Millar hits three homers on consecutive at-bats?&nbsp; So fucking what.&nbsp; None of that shit matters if this team can't manage to win.&nbsp; Instead of that tired-ass baseball cliche of "finding ways to win," the Sox continue to find new and heart-breaking ways to lose.  The season ends here.   &nbsp; P.S.&nbsp; Some things I forgot to mention:&nbsp;  1) Posada was out. 2) I can't believe that Jason Giambi is trying to play everyone's heart strings with his mystery ailment...cancer tests, please.&nbsp; Let's see....symptoms include fatigue, loss of bat speed, loss of power, weight loss..........sounds like good old steroid withdrawal to me!&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuck you, Giambi. 3) I miss East Coast Agony!!!&nbsp;(Down for awhile due to technical difficulties.) &nbsp;Big K, come back!&nbsp; Pleeeeease! 4) Chances are that I won't be posting tomorrow since fricking FOX broadcasts the Cubs game in my particular region of the country, and even though we paid $150 for the MLB Extra Innings package I will still miss tomorrow night's game.&nbsp; Curses.

       One non-Sox related thing first:  I really appreciate those of you who leave comments on my blog (I know there's not many, but I still think it's cool) and I feel bad that I'm never around to respond to them.&nbsp; I think that when most normal people are on the computer I'm at work (1-10 pm) and when I get home I watch the tape of that night's game and go to bed (around 2-3 am,) so I don't really keep normal hours.&nbsp; So if you've left a comment on my blog and I haven't posted anything back, it's probably because I'm at work...maybe I don't even have to post a response, but I would like to be able to, and that's why I feel bad.&nbsp; I know it's stupid and not a big deal, but whatever.&nbsp; This is MY blog and if I want to waste a paragraph in useless apology and excuse-making then I'm allowed.  Okay, enough of that.&nbsp; On to baseball.  First of all, I love my husband to death, he is the best, I'd do anything for him, but there is one thing he does that really irritates me.&nbsp; He finds out the score of the game right when he gets home or gets off work,&nbsp;before he even has a chance to watch the tape of the game.&nbsp; Personally, I like to just watch the game from the first pitch WITHOUT knowing the outcome.&nbsp; I've even walked into the apartment and grabbed a towel from the bathroom, walked into the living room holding the towel in front of me so that I don't see the tv, &nbsp;and then thrown the towel over the screen until the game is over.&nbsp; I did this the other night and Mike was still trying to watch the game  through  the towel.&nbsp; (Last laugh was on him, though, because when he went to peek at the screen he found out he was "watching" an A's game.)&nbsp; So if I don't make it home before Mike, I'm going to learn the score of the game whether I want to or not, before I get to watch the game, and that's what happened with the first game of the double-header yesterday.&nbsp; When I walked in the door I was told that they lost 8-3, and my motivation to watch the game was completely gone.&nbsp; I was very excited about it, too, as it was Abe Alvarez's first major league appearance. We did, however, watch the second game, which the Sox won 4-0.&nbsp; Wakefield pitched a great game last night, going seven shut-out innings with five strikeouts, and I for one couldn't be happier.&nbsp; Wakey is one of those players who give me a warm fuzzy, and I like to see him do well. The top of the Sox's batting order completely sucked, going 0-for-one trillion, (worst offender:&nbsp; Mark "Heroin" Bellhorn.&nbsp; I hope everyone who was bitching on the Sox message boards about him never swinging at pitches&nbsp;is happy now, because last night he was swinging at EVERYTHING.)&nbsp; The bottom of the batting order was hungry, however, and turned in a good performance - particularly Big Mac.&nbsp; He had a great assist from left field, as well as going 2-3, while Kevin Youkilis had a two-run single and a homerun.&nbsp; Even Ricky "I'm Hitting Below the Crespo Line" Gutierrez had a double...so where the hell were BamBam and Pebbles last night??&nbsp; Timlin and Embree closed the game out nicely, but the Sox still manage to lose the series, go figure. BamBam Ortiz got a 5-game suspension for the bat incident, which is about what I was expecting.&nbsp; He is appealing it, of course, so that he can play this weekend against the dirty pinstripers. One more thing that pisses me off:&nbsp; Why didn't Tito start Pedro Martínez on the first game after the All-Star break?????&nbsp; I mean, it would have lined him up to then pitch to the Mariners, whom he absolutely owns, as well as the fricking Yankees.&nbsp; Instead, The Face got all those starts.&nbsp; What the hell is wrong with Tito?&nbsp; What a fucking moron.

       urlLink     Manny Ramírez stars in "The Cutoff Man." Sox lose to the Orioles 10-4...at least, that was the score when I stopped taking score and went to bed.&nbsp; urlLink      I wasn't enraged by this loss.&nbsp; I didn't scream at the television, I didn't tell my husband how much I hated ______ (insert name of offending player/manager/umpire here.)&nbsp; I just filled in my score chart with nothing more than a mental shrug.&nbsp; This disturbs me...I have a reputation (not just in the blogosphere) of being a somewhat vitriolic ranter, and I am a very passionate person -&nbsp;  apathy is death. &nbsp; Yet I didn't even bat an eyelash last night when they took their usual flogging from Baltimore.&nbsp; I don't even think I said anything about how much I hate Miguel Tejada and&nbsp;his sulking, pouting sidekick Melvin Mora.&nbsp; I may have even laughed when Manny made that ridiculous cut-off.&nbsp; It's worrisome, I tell you...In short, I'm having a hard time taking this team seriously anymore.&nbsp;  But hey, what do you expect when you turn on the game and see that your infield is composed of Youkilis at third,  Bellhorn  at  shortstop ,&nbsp;Mueller at  second,  and Millar in any position other than ass-down on the bench.&nbsp; Put this lineup behind Derek Lowe, cue up the calliope music and pass the Cheetos, cause that sounds like a party to me.&nbsp; But fortunately Pedro was pitching (9 hits, eight earned runs) so actually the infield defense was passable last night.&nbsp;&nbsp; And  Millar went 3-4 with a homerun!!&nbsp; As my husband said as Millar was rounding the bases: "It did something!" It was the outfield that was cause for concern.&nbsp; I would say that Johnny Damon was about as effective as a circus seal with a baseball glove balanced on its nose last night.&nbsp; Then there was that one play - the one where Damon couldn't get to another ball, finally got to it, fired it toward Mark Bellhorn except that Manny intercepted the throw with a  completely unneccesary  yet Web Gem-like catch, and then  he  threw it to Bellhorn and ladies and gentlemen, you got yourself and inside-the-park homerun.&nbsp; Manny was joking about getting a Bronze glove instead of a Gold Glove...how about the&nbsp;Pewter Glove, or the Aluminum Foil in the Shape of&nbsp;a Glove.  Voltaire said "God is a comedian playing to an audience that is afraid to laugh."&nbsp; Well I'm not afraid to laugh.&nbsp; This shit is fricking hilarious, isn't it?&nbsp; Absolutely side-splitting.&nbsp; Unbelievable.

       Red Sox offense rolls over and gleefully takes it in the ass from the Mariners to the tune of 8-4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This game didn't have to be this bad.&nbsp; Arroyo pitched a fabulous game with a career high 12 strikeouts.&nbsp; At one point he had 11 consecutive put-outs by way of the K - the last time this was done was by Randy Johnson sometime in the late '90s.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the offense decided to suck a great big black&nbsp;porno penis&nbsp;and turn this game into a pitchers duel between Arroyo and Mariner's pitcher Villone.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who?"&nbsp; Exactly.&nbsp; Worst offenders:&nbsp; Kevin Millar (0-4,) Bill Mueller (0-4,) Gay-b Krapler (1-3 but got caught stealing, grounded into a double play, and layed down a bullshit bunt in extra innings,)&nbsp;and David Ortiz (0-3, two walks.)&nbsp; I knew as soon as I saw Nomar ground into a double play to leave the bases loaded in the first inning that the offense was going to mail in their at-bats once again...Everyone except for Varitek, who was singly responsible for all 4 RBIs for the Sox, including a monster 3-run homer in the top of the eighth inning.&nbsp; Keith Foulke took the mound in the ninth with the score at 4-2 and promptly surrendered back-to-back homeruns, securing his fifth blown save of the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, in the bottom of the twelfth inning, after trying&nbsp;every way they knew how, the Sox finally managed to lose the game&nbsp;thanks to a  walk off grand slam  given up by Curtis Leskanic.  In other Sox related news, Pokey Reese was pulled from the game today after the second inning with a strained muscle in his right rib cage.&nbsp; Unfortunate.&nbsp; Manny finally decided that playing left field might be more entertaining than sitting on the bench and deflating beach balls, chewing tobacco and scratching himself.&nbsp; Wakey is still feeling very stiff from that line-drive he took off his shoulder two days ago and may have to miss his next start against the Orioles, in which case the Sox will need to call someone up from Pawtucket to fill in.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; If they throw Kim in there I might seriously refuse to watch the game.  This shit is just getting depressing.&nbsp; How many .500 series' worth of baseball am I going to have to watch before I realize that the Sox are just a .500 team?&nbsp; Why do I keep watching?&nbsp; Why do I keep getting my hopes up?&nbsp; Why won't they just let me go?  I hate this team.

       Sox split series - Angels go down 6-2.&nbsp;   urlLink Box score.   Sox bats were effectively non-existent through the first five innings but came to life after a single by Damon, a walk by Bellhorn and a three-run homer from Ortiz in the sixth.&nbsp; Curt Schilling pitched a great game, holding the Angels to only one run over eight innings.&nbsp; Even more encouraging was the fact that Schill pitched without any Marcaine shots in his ankle yesterday, and that Tim Wakefield's CT scan came back negative, so that's two less players to worry about.&nbsp;  Unfortunately, there are still two questions that remain unanswered:   1) When will Ortiz's suspension be handed down, and how fricking long will it be? &nbsp; Milton Bradley got 4 games for throwing all those baseballs on the field, and none of them came close to an umpire.&nbsp; They are also calling Ortiz shoving Francona into the umpires "contact," so the suspension could be a lengthy one.&nbsp; If it is five games or less, the Sox are said to be encouraging Ortiz not to appeal and just serve the suspension since he would be back in time for the series vs. the Yanks.&nbsp; He should get the news today or tomorrow.  2) Is Manny ever going to decide to play again? &nbsp; I don't really understand this  urlLink clusterfuck situation. &nbsp; Terry says that he doesn't want to mess up his defensive game by having Manny DH and thereby having to put Ortiz at first base, and although Manny COULD perform in a DH role, Francona doesn't want him in the lineup until he can play left field.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Manny is bopping along, talking about how he is a pinch hitting specialist, saying that he'll come back when he's ready, and refusing to answer "stupid questions."&nbsp; What the fuck is going on here?&nbsp; This shit is annoying as hell.&nbsp; Could everyone just pull their shit together and start acting like a bunch of professionals??&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Sox start a two-game series against the Mariners tonight, and if ever there was a team ripe for a sweep it's Seattle.&nbsp;

      I know that it's only three games into the second half, and perhaps I shouldn't be so negative, but I'm quickly losing hope for this team.&nbsp; I mean, even if they do manage to make the playoffs I have serious doubts about their ability to compete.&nbsp; The mediocrity and half-assedness of this team is so inexplicable that I'm just casting about for a scapegoat and I have officially decided that all of this is Terry's Fault.&nbsp; Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but I don't give a shit - Tito is a piss-poor excuse for a fucking baseball manager, I have declared jihad on him, and henceforth all the&nbsp;disappointment and anger generated in me by the Boston Red Sox will be placed squarely on that moron's doorstep. The Sox dropped last night's game to the Angels 8-3...the Blimp pitched a decent game, but he walked a shit-load of people and, as usual, the Sox were unable to make him pay for it.&nbsp; The only three fucking runs the Sox scored were all on one-run homers (two by Damon, one by Ortiz.)&nbsp; Tim Wakefield, God love him (if God existed), continued his streak of maddening inconsistency by essentially throwing batting practice for the Angels - how nice of him!&nbsp; His outing was cut short when he took a line drive off of the back of his right shoulder.&nbsp; Scary.&nbsp; The ball appeared to be heading directly for his face.&nbsp; Wakey will be getting a CT scan today to make sure that everything is okay. The Angels are dangerously close to making onto my "Teams I Hate" list.&nbsp; First of all, their dumb-ass fans booed for about ten minutes after Wakefield took that ball off the shoulder because they thought the runner should have been safe at first...A furry stuffed monkey would be able to tell you that the ball bounced off of Wakefield's shoulder and was caught by Nomar without touching the ground.&nbsp; Maybe the rules are different in fucking California, but where I come from that's called an "out."&nbsp; And then Donelly stared Pokey down for trying to bunt, which is so stupid and obnoxious that it defies comprehension.&nbsp;&nbsp; One more incident and the Angels could find themselves nearly on par with the Oakland A's.&nbsp; I said  nearly.    &nbsp;

I'm incognito as a Cardinals fan.&nbsp; urlLink     As you can see, Paulie and I went to the Reds/Cardinals game last night.  It was a good time - go figure, the Reds bullpen blew a save.  Danny Graves gave up a two or three run homer in the eighth...I don't remember exactly what it was because, as Paul said, we treated our bodies like amusement parks last night.  But in any case, a good time was had by all, and we returned home happy and in time to catch the Sox game. Petey was hot last night - he had great stuff and was routinely hitting 93/94 mph.  Manny was completely out of the lineup last night due to his hammy...Is anyone else starting to get kinda nervous about this besides me?  I mean, it was funny at first when it seemed like another one of his half-baked excuses to get out of the All-Star game, but now it's cause for concern.  Especially since Ortiz did his best Milton Bradley impersonation and flipped out on the homeplate umpire, throwing a spectacular temper tantrum which started with Ortiz arguing balls and strikes, then getting ejected, then requiring three or four men to restrain him from beating the motherly shit out of the umpire, and finally ended with Ortiz throwing two bats out on the field and nearly hitting some game officials.  This will surely result in a suspension, although how long remains to be seen.  So...Manny and Ortiz BOTH out of the lineup?  Yikes.  Scary. In any case, the Sox won 4-2 last night, with Foulke picking up another save.  Wakefield vs. Colon tonight.

       Terry Francona's Top 10 Ways to Create a Line-up   1. alphabetically   2. by shoe size   3. Pin the Tail on the Donkey, only with players names and a great big line-up card   4. dart board   5. puts player's faces on the dots on a Twister mat and then makes Dave Wallace and Euclides Rojas play a game.   6.&nbsp;Wild Turkey and percoset   7. Makes an extra-large bowl of Rice Krispies and listens to what Snap, Crackle and Pop suggest to him.   8. eye color   9. OPS....backwards   10. Counts the number of steps he must take from his car to the dugout, divides it by the time that he arrives, multiplies that by the jersey number of the first player he sees, and whatever the result is Tito embezzles a corresponding amount out of company funds and&nbsp;goes out and pays for a blowjob from a transvestite crack whore.&nbsp; Tito then divides the number of head-bobs the shemale must make for him to blow a load by the number of times he had to drive around the block looking for just the right whore, and if any player has the resulting number in their birthdate they will be included in the line up.&nbsp; Should there be less than nine players with that number in their birthdate, random people from the crowd will be chosen to stand in.

       urlLink    Rally cuffs fail - Sox drop first game of second half to the Anaheim Angels, 8-1.&nbsp; urlLink    &nbsp; I am really fucking tired of Terry Francona.&nbsp;  It's weird - I had such a positive feeling right before the All-Star Break when the Sox won 5 in a row and were playing like we all knew they could...And in the span of one game I somehow feel like it's June again.&nbsp; The Sox looked pretty shoddy last night, a combination of that simp Washburn having a good night and a couple stupid fucking moves on the part of Kevin Millar.&nbsp; Johnny Damon had his 16-game hitting streak come to a bullshit end on a bad call from the first base umpire.&nbsp; For some stupid fucking reason Cap'n Tito had Derek Lowe pitching instead of Pedro and, as usual, the wheels fell off Gidget's wagon.&nbsp; (Unless the Sox can manage to score 6 runs in the first couple of innings, they are not going to win when Derek Lowe is pitching.&nbsp; It's a fact.)&nbsp; Can the Red Sox catch ANYONE stealing?&nbsp; I mean seriously&nbsp;- Bengie Molina could fucking steal second on Varitek.&nbsp; And not having Pedro pitch last night means that he will miss the Yankees series next week.&nbsp; Quite honestly, this makes me want to throw my fucking computer monitor across the living room.&nbsp; Terry Francona couldn't manage his way out of a wet paper bag!! But it was just one game, right?&nbsp; The second half can't possibly be as half-assed as the first half, I refuse to believe it.&nbsp; There is still good baseball to be played!!

      So I lied about not making another post until after the All-Star Break.  urlLink    All about Dave.&nbsp; urlLink     This is my sous chef, Dave, also known as Big Pen, Manolo, Gigli, DP, and, after busy Saturday nights, Señor Pinga Roja ("Mr. Red Penis.")  Dave is one of the best cooks I've ever known, which is probably how he got his job.  (Well, that and a lot of blowjobs.)  Dave took me from a little know-nothing punk and made me the semi-respectable cook that I am today, and I'm sure it hasn't been easy - he tries to strangle me to death at least once a week, and the backs of my upper arms are generally covered with bruises from Dave pinching me all the time.  (If you've never been pinched there before, try it - it's a real blast.)  Dave is a wonderful, knowledgable boss and an excellent friend.  Never play him at chess, never talk to him about Sim City 4, never let him see your scallops searing on the side - if you can do those things then you should be able to get along fairly well with him.  Dave also is a great big hater, as he suggested that perhaps 95% of people reading this blog did so because they were old, perverted men who were jacking off to my picture because they thought I was a thirteen year old boy.  So this is my tribute to Dave - my favorite cook-turned-sous chef ever.  Unfortunately, he's not single, so ladies - move along, nothing to see here.  Dave rocks! In some random Sox news, Ortiz wasn't that great in the Home Run Derby.  He got three, but might have ended up with four or five if they had had the stupid roof opened for the first round.  It was fun to see him and Manny messing around together, though, and Ortiz's pre-game get-up can be summed up in one word: Playalistic.  I think Ortiz borrowed his sunglasses from J-Lo or something. I agree with SurvivingGrady.com - R.J. is going to end up in pinstripes.  I don't want him on the Sox, but I DEFINITELY don't want him on the Yankees.  I wish he'd just stay the hell in Arizona, to be honest, but it's not looking that way.  I hope that the Yankees stadium breaks off the fucking continent and drifts up to Nova Scotia with all of it's players and fans inside, and I hope that George Steinbrenner gets put in a metal barrel and rolled down 17 flights of concrete stairs. While still in a vein of outright hatred, my husband and I were talking about steroid abusers in baseball and surprise, surprise, Jason Giambi's name came up.  Has anyone ever thought about this:  Jason Giambi hit two homers in game 7 of the ALCS...if he weren't juicing, maybe one of those wouldn't have gone out...and then who knows what would have happened.  Fucking dirty, scumbag, pinstriping CHEATER!!!  I don't believe in God, but if I did I would pray to him every night to let me find Giambi in the street somewhere so that I could scream right in his ugly fucking face. The All-Star game should be entertaining tonight...and tomorrow our favorite Masshole in the world, Paulie, is coming to stay with us for a few days!  And I get my first Friday off in probably....I don't know, years!  Wooohooooooo!

      It's not the curse of the Bambino, it's the curse of Sarah and Mike. Whenever we're around to watch live feed of the game, the Sox always lose, never fail.  They looked a little lackluster today, honestly, except for some seventh inning excitement that consisted of Mirabelli and J.D. going deep one after the other.  JD extended his hitting streak to 16 games.   In other news, Manny's grandma died again - no wait, his mother fainted - oh no wait a minute, it was his hamstring.  Ya, that's right, his hamstring - ya, that's the ticket! - Anyway, Manny was a late scratch from the lineup but did make an appearance as a pinch hitter late in the game.  It looked like Schilling was reading him the riot act before the game.  I'm sure that the media is going to blow this way out of proportion, but I really wish they wouldn't. Congrats to David Ortiz and his wife for the birth of their son D'Angelo! I don't think I'll be making any posts until after the All-Star Break, so ta-ta for now!

(Some of us might have even gone to bed too happy.)&nbsp; urlLink     I had to pull out the Hangover Cup this morning - a huge, plastic Great American Ballpark 2003 Inaugural Season souvenir Reds cup that holds about a quart and a half of water.  When I strike it rich I'm going to have a trough built on the side of my bed for mornings like this that I can just dunk my entire head into and gulp water like an animal. But who cares about that when the Sox played such a  fantastic  game last night! Itemized list:  1. Invasion of the Body Snatchers   You can't fool me - I know that wasn't Kevin Millar at first base!  That was his brother Carl Millar.  Carl Millar seems like he wants to win a Gold Glove, making several great defensive plays including but not limited to TWO line-outs into double plays.  Kevin must have been out getting a new gun rack installed on his pick up or something.  Won't the real Slim Shady please stand up??  2. Johnny Damon is on-freaking-fire!  Can you believe this guy?  Wow.  That's all I have to say, just Wow.  3. Mark Bellhorn Personality Watch   Everybody:  I saw Mark Bellhorn smile  last night.  Apparently the lights are on AND somebody's home.  While it did bring me some measure of satisfaction, (I actually cheered and clapped,) I was also left with a strange empty feeling. It's like you spend five years training with a Sherpa to climb Mount Everest and then you do it and the next day you're wondering what the hell you're going to do with the rest of your life. I'll just have to find something else to occupy my mind with during games...undressing Manny with my eyes is always good to fall back on when I'm in an imaginative slump.  Speaking of Manny...  4. Manny's Bobblehead Boyfriend   If Derek Lowe does nothing for the rest of the season (and let's face it, he probably won't,) at least he brought that ridiculous Bobblehead Pedro into the dugout, making me feel an emotion OTHER than anger and disgust for the first time since the '03 ALDS.  Priceless.  5. I know it can't last forever,  but aren't winning streaks just fucking wonderful?

       urlLink    Oakland can't handle Billy Mueller's Shaolin Style as Boston brings tha mutha-fuckin ruckus!&nbsp; urlLink     SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!   I didn't get home from work tonight until the bottom of the ninth, yet I was just in time to see the sweetest part of the action.  With two outs in the bottom of the tenth inning, Johnny Damon scored from first on a double by Bill Mueller to win the game and complete the SWEEEEEEEEEP of the hated Oakland A's.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it, assholes!  (I'm still happily surfing a wave of vengefulness from seeing Oakland fans cheering when Damon and Jackson collided in the '03 ALDS.)  The Sox are playing like it's April again! The offense is officially en fuego, the defense has tightened up (except for Manny doing his worst Pele impersonation the other night,) and the man hugs are back.  Obstacles still remain (Derek Lowe and Tito, not to name any names) but for now the Sox have their game faces on.  And I'll admit it, I'm suckered in.  I believe.  I'm a hopeless, wobbling glob of emotional jello when it comes to the Red Sox.  (And "Babe," I always cry at the end of that movie, but don't tell anybody.) Next series is against the Texas Rangers, who are amazingly first in the AL West. The Face is pitching.  Lowe is a train wreck of a human being.  Hopefully he can keep the momentum going. Trai la bullaaaaaaaaaaa!

      Wow.  Another drubbing of the Oakland A's, another 11 runs scored, and can anyone reading this believe that Kevin Millar is  4-7  in this series??   I'm not saying that the Red Sox are going to go out and score eleven runs every game from now on, but I don't think that these games are just a fluke.  The Sox started to wake up and play decent baseball back during the series with the Yankees, and their efforts are finally coming together.  I love the fact that the 22 runs the Sox scored the past two nights didn't all come as a result of homeruns - meaning that the Sox are starting to get timely hits with men on base.  And would you believe that all this run production has come with Manny and Ortiz sitting on their thumbs both games?  (Manny's GARGANTUAN homerun over the Coke bottle last night notwithstanding.) Sweet P. put in a solid performance last night, pitching 7 with 7 strikeouts (if I remembered correctly,) and a nifty play at first base to catch an errant throw from Fatso. It hasn't been talked about too much, but Pedro is really doing quite a good job, despite a 3+ ERA...now if only he'd get rid of that Jeri curl helmet he's got on... The final game of the A's series tonight.  I don't want to use the S-word, but it's Schill's turn, and you gotta feel pretty optimistic about that!  Mark Bellhorn Personality Watch:   After hitting his tenth homerun of the season, we almost saw Bellhorn smile in the dugout, but it was a fake-out.  Then later we got excited when he started to argue with the umpire, but were let down again when Tito came up and got in the middle of things and Bellhorn lapsed back into passivity just when it seemed as if we might have made a breakthrough.

       urlLink    Rally cuffs for the Sox, July 6...Red Sox beat the A's 11-0.&nbsp; urlLink     Photographic proof that the rally cuffs work! I haven't made any posts this week because of the holiday and because our modem broke (again.)  I've got a repair guy coming down here in about 15 minutes and guess what - the modem's working now.  Ha!  Not that I wanted to make a post after the game on Sunday, except maybe about how much I still hate Terry Francona and Derek Lowe.  Mike and I were laying on the couch together on Monday watching the Reds/Cards game when my good friend Paulie calls and says "Dude, don't you think that the Sox could save money by just releasing Derek Lowe and buying a state of the art pitching machine?"  Yes, I do.  But that's all in the past. Last night was a vintage 2003 performance - 11 runs scored (aome of which came with THE BASES LOADED!!!  Have you ever heard of anything so crazy??  I mean, runs being scored with the bases loaded - that's cutting edge baseball, ladies and gentlemen!) Tim Wakefield 3-hit the A's over seven innings, while Mr. Lucky got his ass handed to him, including but not limited to 2 walks with the bases loaded.  (That's called "pulling a Heredia" around our house.)  Ortiz probably should have sat last night - he's pretty substandard against lefties and last night was a prime example - but that's the only real bitch I can come up with.  For the first time in FOREVER my husband and I were actually able to have FUN watching a baseball game, another new concept.   I have to curtail this entry due to the imminent arrival of the repair man.  Adios.

      Well...I had a feeling that the Sox were going to lose tonight, yet I let myself get suckered in by extra-inning heroics (Leskanic pitching himself out of a jam in the twelfth, Manny's go-ahead homer) and look where it got me.  Depressed.  Again.  I hate that feeling, like someone just kicked you in the stomach and you want to puke.  As much as I like to walk around and say that I don't care anymore and that I've given up on the Red Sox for this season, the truth of the matter is that I obviously haven't.  I still hope.  Somewhere deep inside me is a little grain of optimism that just won't leave me the hell alone. And it's in an optimistic spirit that I write this:  Yes, tonight's game was unfortunate because the Red Sox lost.  Yes, it sucks that the Red Sox are 8.5 games back in the standings and are effectively out of contention to win the division.  Yes, we all still hate Terry Francona. Yes, it's really annoying that the Sox were one pitch away from a win. That said, if you look at this game just as  one game  and not as the most recent game in a long, agonizing, frustrating series of fuck-ups...it really wasn't too bad.  I mean, it was a decent game.  The Sox managed to play some decent baseball.  They didn't lose because they committed a country shit ton of errors, they didn't lose because their starting pitcher sucked so bad that the offense couldn't possibly make up the difference...they just lost a good baseball game in a (fairly) natural way.  And I take a little bit of heart from that.  (That and seeing Jeter's face look like it got bashed with a rusty rake.) I would like to go even further in my insane, ridiculous, and completely unfounded optimistic blather and say that the reason that the Sox played so well (or not-bad, I should say,) today was because Tito put the  best line-up possible  on the field.  Think about it.  McCarty, Bellhorn, Youkilis and Pokey is the best infield that the Sox can put together right now, and that is precisely what Tito put out there...and guess what?  The Sox managed to catch the damn ball for the first time since Christ left Chicago.  Scores of people the world over are getting arrested every day for child pornography - why can't Tito be one of them?  But even a blind squirrel finds a nut every now and then, and today Tito did a decent job.  (Millar was still in the lineup, unfortunately, but that was only to give Trot's sore quad a rest.) Okay, onto the negativity.  C'mon guys, you knew it was coming!  NOMAR: GET THE FUCK OFF OF MY BELOVED TEAM YOU ARROGANT, SELF-CENTERED, PANTY-WAISTED ASSHOLE!  YOU MAKE ME WANT TO PUKE.  YOU ARE A FUCKING CANCER ON THIS TEAM, I HOPE YOU DO NOTHING BUT RIDE PINE FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON BECAUSE YOUR DEFENSE STINKS LIKE HOT GARBAGE, AND I CAN'T STAND TO SEE THAT PATHETIC, SIMPERING LOOK ON YOUR FACE ANYMORE.  TAKE A TIP FROM MANNY: GROW UP AND BE A FUCKING MAN!  I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU BEFOULING SOME OTHER TEAM'S UNIFORM.  Can you believe I kiss my mother with this mouth?

      I've been so angry for so long that I just feel numb right now.  When I walked into our apartment last night and saw Mike sitting at the computer in a deathly silent apartment, I knew right away what had happened.  The Sox blew it again.  We didn't watch last night's game, we didn't even watch ESPN - we watched a biography of John Wayne Gacy on A&E.  It's like we were in post-2003 ALCS mode: for about three or four days after Oct. 16, 2003 my husband and I couldn't watch ESPN, couldn't look at Sports Illustrated or even at the sports section of the Cincinnati Enquirer, couldn't watch the World Series - everything was just too painful.  Last night was like that.  It was truly depressing.  We were even talking about what moves they should make next year, like the season is already over.   I was asking myself (again while playing Grand Theft Auto - is it bad that I do most of my philosophizing and mulling over of life while controlling a man running through a city with an AK47 in his hands?) what was worse, losing in the 11th inning of the 7th game of the ALCS, or being out of contention before the All-Star break.  I think that the Game 7 scenario is worse.  So, um, at least we have that going for us...

       urlLink    HAIRBALL.  urlLink    Okay, this is my last ditch rally effort. Fuck the rally cuff, that sort of went out last year with the "Cowboy Up" head-shaving thing, and I'm just clinging onto the name due to sentimentality. (Plus, the only person that can really wear the rally cuff with a positive result is John Frakes. My luck has run out, apparently.) My new thing: the Rally Videotape. Yup, it's as sad and desperate as it sounds. See, my husband and I work second shift and are very rarely around to watch games as they actually unfold live, so we set the VCR and then come home and watch them from like 11-1 or so at night. And if something spectacular happens during a game we officially retire the videotape and label it and save it for that cold, January tuesday night when we're both bored and fiending for some baseball. For example, we have from last year (just off the top of my head) the game we attended in Cleveland in September when Pedro pitched, game 5 of the ALDS, and a tape simply labeled "Sox v. Mariners 8/03." (There are more but listing them all is boring and too nerdy even for me.) Anyhow, ya, the Sox/Mariners tape. It's a Sunday Night Baseball game, during that four-game sweep the Sox pulled off. It's nothing too spectacular, but Mike and I saved it because it just had this sort of......magic to it. It was like the first time that we really felt like things were going the Sox's way, that they were nearly untouchable. Everything seemed to come so easy. We smiled and laughed and high-fived during that game (which we got to watch live cause it was on a Sunday) and it was, well, magical. So tonight we started watching the game WAY late, around 2:30 because we had friends over for chess and beer, and HOLY SHIT were the Sox hitting the cover off the ball way early. And during the game Millar happened to mention that very same series in August - and it was funny because I had been thinking that this game had a similar feel. Quite frankly, it was a blast to watch. Three runs in the first, five in the second and five in the third, not to mention Pedro looking gayer than ever with a red foam bat, Manny giving Dougie Alphabet a wet-willy, and the guest commentating by Lenny Clarke and Dennis Leary.  (Normally Dennis Leary gets on my nerves, but just seeing Remy and Orsillo geek out so hard made it positively hilarious.)  So, in that vein, I'm saving this tape.  This one, magical moment out of two or so months when we haven't saved a single game, I'm going to save.  Because it's really now or never.

       Remy and Orsillo shocked me tonight by revealing that the Sox are actually only  four games  off of their 2003 pace.  That fact was almost inconceivable to me, and made me feel like a real Chicken Little, (Oooooh, I said the L-name!) yet it was appropriate that it was brought to my attention during tonight's 2003-esque performance.  The Sox followed up a three-run fifth inning with a five-run sixth, all five runs coming with 2 outs and all 8 RBIs coming from the bottom two-thirds of the batting order.  The first three in the line-up (Damon, Mientkiewicz and Manny) were a nauseating 0-12, but no matter - Varitek, Mueller, Youkilis and  Cabrera  all had 2 ribbies apiece.     Incidentally, I'm developing a sort of soft spot for Orlando Cabrera.  It's completely irrational and unfounded, I know, but I find myself kind of inwardly rooting for his success.  I need to give him a nickname, and I don't think "Treasure Troll" will cut it.  Too cumbersome.  I was thinking tonight that he kind of looks like Richard Seymour's Mini Me...maybe I could call him "Little Dick?"  Yikes, no.  I guess it will just come to me when the time is right.   Anyhow, it was nice to see Bronson Arroyo finally get the run support that he deserves.  He had a perfectly reasonable game tonight, pitching 6 and 2/3 innings with seven hits, three earned runs and six strikeouts.  This was more of the type of baseball that I was expecting to see on this homestand.  I'd like to hope that the positive energy will carry over into tomorrow night, but the Face is taking the mound and we all know what a crapshoot that is.   Six Degrees of Seperation:  I used to work with this crazy (but nice) drunk named Dan who was a college buddy of Kevin Youkilis.  Neato.  I guess.   Completely off topic:  I get a happy, geeked-out feeling when Manny wears his socks up.  I felt sure that a home run was on order tonight, especially during that nine or ten-pitch at bat in the sixth, but alas, Manny was 0-4 with 3 strikeouts.  Ay ay ay.  Is he ever gonna get his stroke back??

       What, me worry?  What a discouraging game.  I mean really,  really  discouraging.  I am, in fact, having an extremely negative moment right now.  And in the midst of all the anger and the agony I am forced to hear - over and over and over again - Take a chance, make it happen, Pop the cork, finger-snappin, Spin the wheel Round and round we gooooooooo! Life is good, life is sweet, Grab yourself a front row seat, Let's meet and have a ball! YAAAAAAAAAAAH Let's live...for the wondeeerrrrrrrrrr-of it all! Meet me at Foxwoods! (Foxwoods!) Who is the scrawny little piece of shit who lipsynchs that fucking tune?  I mean, how old is that guy?  When you see him at a three quarters view he looks like fucking Skeletor.  I'd like to find that guy and work him over with a serrated aluminum baseball bat.  The last thing I want to hear when the Sox are losing in yet another heart-wrenching, open-your-belly-and-strew-your-guts-around-like-christmas-tree-garland way is this little simp's impossibly upbeat garbage when what I'd really like is to have a 14 hour standoff with the Boston police department on top of the roof of Fenway armed with a harpoon gun while wearing a yellow raincoat and an Alfred E. Neuman mask. I blame Terry Francona.  I want his job.  I want to be Terry Francona just for one week - one lousy fucking week.  Someone give me a clipboard, break my nose, bust up my knees, shave my head, give me the worst case of hypertension and heart disease this side of a third world country and let me get down there in the dugout.   I'd make Lou Pinella look like a suicide hotline counselor.  If this lousy team can't win a goddamn game then at least they can be as miserable as I am. All except Mark Bellhorn.  He is exempt from all punishment.  Bellhorn will be the "Snowball" to my "Napoleon." L-O-S-E-R-S. But am I going to watch tomorrow?  Of course I am!  Wouldn't miss it for the world.

      What a whacky game yesterday afternoon.  The Tigers and Sox combined for 10 home runs - Wakefield gave up six of them, something that hasn't been done by a winning pitcher for forty-some-odd years.  It wasn't the prettiest of games, but it was a win and I'll take it.  (The Treasure Troll even had three hits!  Holy Shit!) The Sox are now in a three-way tie for the Wild Card, and are about to play 30 of the remaining 50-something games at home, where their record is 33-18.  Could this be the mythical corner that they have been supposed to turn since June?  Schilling kicks it off tonight against the D-Bags.

       urlLink    Let's throw a Petey Party!  (Hey Raul, this picture is for you!)  urlLink     Brugal might not be the only fine Dominican product to get better with age - last night Pedro retired NINE out of the first ten Tigers he faced, SEVEN by way of the K.  Sweet P. had eleven strikeouts in all through seven innings, with four hits, two earned runs, one wild pitch and one hit batter (Dmitri Young, but don't worry - Pedro hit him right on the spare tire, so no harm done, I'm sure.)   As for the offense --- Bam Bam is back (2 RBI!) but Pebbles is down with "flu-like symptoms" which probably include red, swollen eyes, dizziness, loss of concentration, coughing, and a strong urge to sit in front of an "I Love the 90s" marathon with a bag of Doritos and a liter of Moutain Dew Code Red.  Elsewhere, Dave Roberts had a big night, showing up clutch with two ribbies of his own on a double and a sac-fly, and with his walk in the seventh and his basehit in the ninth he was able to get on base in every at-bat.  Who would have thunk it?  Kevin Millar was on base three times, scoring a run in the kind of weird seventh inning:  Ennis gives up a walk to Roberts, then balks during Damon's at-bat.  Ennis walks Damon, too and gets pulled out of the game for Al Levine who gives up three consecutive basehits.  The last one is to David Ortiz, who, while trying to stretch a single into a double, gets caught in what I scored as a "Sac-Pickle" for lack of a better term, allowing Krapler to score from third while Ortiz tries to evade a rundown.  Boom, a four-run inning, and any momentum the Tigers might  have had completely disappeared.  It was very nice to see the Sox playing a little small ball.   And with Oakland and the Rangers both losing, the Sox are now one game back in the wild card standings.   Whoop-la! One bitch though, and I think I've read this many times in many other places,  but for God's sweet sake, Tito AREN'T THERE ANY OTHER PITCHERS IN YOUR BULLPEN BESIDES TIMLIN AND EMBREE????   I'm starting to HATE those two guys.  I mean what about Mendoza??  Remember when he was lights out for us a couple weeks ago?  What about Terry Adams?  What about Mike Myers?  Just because Williamson is out (not for much longer, by the way) doesn't mean that there are NO other options.  What's the deal? - it's like since Grady Little failed to put Timlin or Embree in during game 7, Tito's going to make sure he puts them in every opportunity he gets.  What a pendejo. And finally, I think that this story deserves to be told, in the event that the Sox should - gulp - lose today:  my buddy Kevin at work is from Detroit and told me an amusing tidbit of information last night.  He has a friend who is a sports whore - she goes to all the bars where all the baseball/hockey/football players hang out, depending on the season, and tries to sleep with them.  Apparently she slept with a member of the Tigers rotation last year whose name she won't divulge and said that the guy like to have not one but TWO fingers stuck up his ass during sex.  I mean, one isn't really all that unheard of - a little freaky, yes, but nothing beyond the pale.  But two. Wow.  No comment.  Except that I'm going to say it's probably Bonderman.

      Wow, this game was a real snoozer.  The Sox dropped the first game of a three-game series in Detroit 4-3, Derek Lowe's record dropped below .500, and the Sox dropped to double digits behind the MFYs for the first time this season.  The good news is that Dave McCarty and Jason Varitek each got three hits apiece.  The bad news is that everyone else more or less sucked, especially the Treasure Troll (0-5.)  As usual, the Sox line-up was like bullpen Viagra to teams with usually underachieving relief pitchers.  The Tigers bullpen can't hold it together against teams like, say, the Blue Jays, but when it comes to pitching to the Red Sox they suddenly turn into a whole team of Dennis Eckersleys.  Roberto Novoa (4 consecutive strikeouts, nevermind walking in the tying run) and Jaime Walker had the Red Sox wearing panties and hooker boots before they brought in Ugie to seal the deal.  D. Lowe didn't do too bad by his own pathetic standards, but still got charged with the loss.  And I still don't like him.  Sweet P. tomorrow, though!  Whoooopeeeee!

      I miss St. Louis. It's weird how you can be away from a city for years and years and drive down streets and boulevards that have been vastly overdeveloped since you quit living there at age 9 but still somehow recognize things - still somehow know that you're  home .   urlLink    The low, hazy skies of St. Louis and the  urlLink Gateway Arch . urlLink      urlLink    The field at Busch Stadium. There was an hour long rain delay due to a passing thunderstorm.  urlLink      urlLink    Left field with the Arch looming in the distance.  urlLink      urlLink    Tarp finally off, skies clear, people seated - not a bad ballpark, huh? I saw my first game here when I was about 5. This is the view from our seats in the right field bleachers.  urlLink      urlLink    Busch Stadium at night as we were leaving. Cards won 4-3 (I think. Or maybe it was 5-4.)  In any case, Pujols hit a walk-off homer that we didn't see because we had to leave early.  And I had to watch Suppan pitch AGAIN (2nd time this season.)  I think it's some sort of pennance for having bitched about him so much last year.  urlLink     Sox took 2 out of 3 from the D-Bags, but I don't have any specifics since we were away all week.  This Nomar thing is getting a little bit ridiculous...I wish everyone would just let it die.  Stop picking the scabs. And my man Bellhorn is on the DL with a broken thumb!  This is just untenable.  I just sort of get the sense that the season is on some sort of long, slow Trail of Tears at the end of which is a very early exit from the playoffs.  But I will still watch.  There will still be Ortiz blasting home runs, Pedro striking out chumps, Johnny Damon making diving catches, and Manny Ramirez sitting in the dugout looking like he slept in his uniform on a dirty mattress under a highway overpass next to a cozy, crackling campfire lit in a metal garbage can.  Unfortunately there will be no more post-error closeups of Bellhorn's sweaty face looking like Martin Sheen in the closing scenes of "Apocalypse Now."  Incidentally, can't you picture Bellhorn getting totally shitfaced and doing karate moves on the mirror in his hotel room in his briefs and then sleeping with a gun on his nightstand a la "Apocalypse Now" as well?  Go ahead, imagine it.  It's funny.

      Well, today's game certainly lived up to my expectations as a pitcher's duel that the Sox would most likely lose.  They put up a good fight, however.  Cabrera hit a one-run homer on his first at-bat with the Red Sox, and Manny temporarily came out of his funk with a one-run shot of his own, but in the end it was their supposedly improved defense that let them down again.   A fucked up relay of a sacrifice fly from Morneau (Cabrera pulled a "Manny" and kicked the ball away from him when he should have scooped it up) caused the go-ahead run to score in the eighth inning.   Sox were unable to make anything happen in the ninth, even a little help from Nathan who hit the first batter he faced, Mark Bellhorn.  (My husband and I both gave Nathan a warning "Hey!" that special players get when they get hit by a pitch, and accompanied Mark down to first base with applause for being a man about it.  As  urlLink Beth  pointed out, his facial expression barely changed.)  Cabrera swung at some bullshit and struck out, then Manny grounded into his three-hundred thousandth double play and that was all she wrote.  It was too bad they had to waste all that excellent work from Petey, though - seven innings pitched, 9 hits, 2 runs and eleven strikeouts.  Remy and Sean were bitching during the eighth about Pedro being pulled too early - after only 101 pitches - but if I were Francona I'd probably have done the same thing.   Intermittently during the game Mike and I would switch the channel over to the Cubs game to see Nomar, and let me tell you folks - it is an unnatural sight.   But Nomar was a douchebag, and that's just life.  Remy was talking during the game today about how Nomar was complaining that his achilles was giving him a lot of trouble and that he may even have to go on the DL in August to keep him in playing condition.  He told Francona that he wouldn't be playing yesterday because he was too injured, yet when Lucchino called to tell Nomar that he was being shopped to the Cubs and that Lucchino had to know if he was healthy, Nomar answers : "Now I am."  And we see him today in Wrigley Field, looking as healthy as can be.  The guy was a douchebag, he looked absolutely miserable in the Red Sox dugout and frequently on the field, his defense was verging on terrible this year, as soon as he came back with the team they started to  really  suck and look lifeless...I never got a chance to see the  real   Nomar.  When I started following the Sox with my husband, he was on the DL in 2001.  And the 2004 version of Nomar was overrated at best.  So I don't have the I-Grew-Up-With-Nomar nostalgia working for me, and I'm frankly glad he's gone. Now as for Cabrera, Roberts and Mientkievicz, that remains to be seen.  Cabrera looks like a brown version of one of those trolls that you used to put on the end of your pencils in grade school, but I realize that's no basis for judging a player's skills.  Time will tell.  Should be interesting. Sox remain one game behind the Texas Rangers in the Wild Card standings.  They will be facing the Tampa Bay Devil Rays starting tomorrow through Thursday.  Ortiz dropped his appeal and began serving his five game suspension today.  The next three out of four pitchers are lefties for the Sox, so it looks like as good a time as any.

       urlLink    Don't let the door hit you where the good lord split you.  urlLink     I guess from reading various blogs and news sources that this may not be a very popular move.  But to me, this move was inevitable.   In fact, I've been quite vocal in the past about wanting Nomar to get traded, and I can't say that I'm that heartbroken about it.  At all. However, it is weird. When I was  at the bar tonight my friend Paulie called just to say "Wow."  And when my husband and I got home we wanted to watch the tape of tonight's game even though we knew the Sox had lost, just to see what it would look like without Nomar.  It  is   weird.  More weird than I expected.  But hardly the end of the world. Maybe I'll write more tomorrow when I've had time to process everything.  For now I'm just sort of stunned.
