      When we are allocating money into equity investments...it's important to know that results  are not not commensurate with activity. One cannot increase returns by increasing investment activity. The two factors are totally unrelated. Infact..I would venture to suggest that returns will actually DECREASE when activity INCREASES. Many speculators and investors approach their enterprising investment operations just as they would approach their day jobs...where by they think that they have to take home money from the markets every day...as if they were working for hourly wages. This kind of thinking will bring with it many perilous tribulations to ones investment operations.   It is important to know that there is a time to buy and a time to sit tight. The sitting time should far and away exceed your active buying and selling. This is good investing discipline..to buy only at times when the odds are most in your favor. The idea is to only make an advance when you are certain that you will not have to retreat.  Warren Buffett is a master this kind of discipline. Perhaps no one is more disciplined than the Oracle of Omaha. Warren will patiently sit tight for years if necessary until he believes that a particular stock or business is quoted at a good price and offers his required margin of safety. Mr. Buffett wanted to buy a big stake in Coca Cola back in the 80's. Buffett put Coke on his watch list and simply waited for the stock price to come to him...he was not going to chase the price. The price would come down to a point that he found attractive..or he would never buy it. No exceptions. Mr. Buffett kept Coke on his watch list for many years before the zero hour finally arrived...and once Buffett made his move, he did it in a very big way! Buffett bought millions of shares that amounted to a very siggnifigant portion of the entire company. Buffett was now one of Coke's largest shareholders. Soon he found himself on Coke's board of directors. Buffett's investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, has made an absolute killing on that big Coke bet...and they still hold those shares today. Buffett has pledged to never sell those Coke shares.  The lesson here simply is to wait patiently until you are certain that once the advance is made, you will never have to retreat! Further, when the stars have lined up during that crucial zero hour...bet big! Back up the truck as Buffett did with his Coca Cola shares. He who rarely bets..but bets big when he does make his move...will far and away outperform those that feel they need to place bets every day and every week. I like Buffett's analogy comparing investing to baseball. Buffett says that buying stocks is like standing in the batter's box ready to take a swing. Buffett says that it is very important to be patient and wait for the fat pitch. Buffett further explains that investors have a big advantage over ball players because we will never be called out on strikes for not swinging the bat..where as a hitter can be called out for not taking the bat off his shoulder. If we just patiently wait and bide our time..eventually a very fat pitch is certain to come right down the middle. These are the pitches that are sure to be crushed out of the ball park! Home run! Remember...you never have to take a swing until you get that fat pitch. Most active speculators and investors are constantly swinging at every pitch. There are many strikeouts with this approach...and many staggering investment losses often result.  So one of my major tenets is to be a disciplined investor. Wait for the fat pitch. Wait for that zero hour to arrive. Be certain that if I advance, I will not have to retreat. Finally, when the odds are heavily in my favor...bet big!

      I'm sure many will read my initial blog and gasp when they see that I intend to create a corporation that one day might reach a market value of a billion dollars or more. I do not remember exactly from where this quote originated...but it had a profound meaning to me....  "It is our responsibility as men and women to proceed as though limits to our abilities do not exist. We are collaborators in creation"  Magellan Capital Enterprises is a start up investment company that will be modeled after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and perhaps also a bit like Joe Steinberg's and Ian Cumming's Leucadia National Corp. Some call these models 'investment banks' or 'diversified holding companies'. You might also refer to them as conglomerates. Like berkshire..we will start obtaining assets and deriving revenues from equity trading. At some point in our bright future...we might consider other more tangiable assets such as real estate and/or the purchase of certain businesses outright via privately negotiated purchase. Our capital will need to be infinitely more impressive to enter these arenas. For now we will work with mosquitoes..and save the elephants for later.   I believe that it takes the same amount of energy to think big as it does to think small..which is why I prefer to think and dream big! Every great achievement had its origins as an idea in the mind of someone with a vision of success. The bible says that any man without a vision shall surely perish. I believe in myself and my ideas and I cannot ever imagine existing or living without big dreams and goals. What kind of life would that be...just going through the motions day after day? I don't even want to consider that kind of existence. What are your goals and dreams my friends?   Many might scoff at my bold goals for Magellan Capital Enterprises in light of our very meager beginnings.....but I am not one to let anyone else steal my dreams. I'll forge ahead with a positive attitude...in the face of any and all criticism and doubt. Nothing will stop me! I will never quit! It's going to work because I'm going to make it work! We will see solutions where others see problems....progressively moving forward one brick at a time..with a positve proactive attitude. Besides...why can't I do it? If not me then who? If not now then when?   As you see in the previous blog...Magellan is in need of more capital. MUCH MORE! I will be adding funds in the coming days and weeks. I also have an employee sponsored 403b retirement plan that I might consider accessing for additional capital. At some point we will need to get involved in a few opportunistic equity trades to begin putting our capital to work for us(but only when the time is right and when odds better favor us) and in so doing, creating revenue streams both realized and unrealized.  At some point very soon, I am going to begin talking more about my philosophy and approach to investing in the markets. I can tell you that I have advanced my education in this area based on the study of investors like Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Benjamin Graham, Charles Munger, William O'Neil, and speculators such as Jesse Livermore and Nicolas Darvas amongst others. I have developed somewhat of a hybrid approach to my investment operations. At times I may adhere to a value system like Buffett and Graham, other times growth like O'Neil. On some occasions we may even venture into short selling or perhaps arbitrage when those opportunities present themselves favorably. Further, on some occasions our operatiions will be based purely on fundamental analysis...and at other times we will rely on technical analysis and chart pattern recognition. Perhaps a combination of the two will be in order in many instances. No matter, the idea is simply to achieve the highest after tax return on your investment operations. That is the goal of all speculators and investors. Do not be mislead...we all want the same thing.  I have found that many of the different philosophies each have many valid ideas. I have tried to learn from all of them. I am a latticework of many different approaches and philosophies.....a hybrid investor/speculator if you will. William O'Neal's 'Can Slim' growth investment modeling system has great appeal to me. I have studied this sytem insatiably through O'Neil's book 'How To Make Money In Stocks'. I have read this book not fewer than five occasions. I like this system and will surely put many of these ideas to work for us. Much of the Can Slim formula comes from the teachings of the late great speculator Jesse Livermore. Livermore sold short the entire market just before the great crash of 1929 and reportedly made over $100,000,000 in a single day. That was a lot of money in 1929! Heck..that's still alot of money even now..over 70 years later.  William O'Neil, besides authoring the book mentioned above, founded Investor's Business Daily(a daily investor's publication in direct competition with the Wall Street Journal)...and the institutional research firm William J. O'Neil & Co. Several decades ago, Mr. O'Neil managed to turn $5,000 into over $200,000 in rather short order and then used those proceeds to found his own company and also to purchase a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. O'Neil credits his success to his Can Slim investing model that he created through many trials and tribulations on Wall Street.. Can Slim is an acronym...and each letter in the Can Slim acronym stands for a certain trait that all the big stock market winners had before they made their towering advances. The Can Slim acronym is based on an exhaustive study of the greatest stock market winners of the past 50 years. I will explain the meaning of each letter in the acronym in a coming blog. Here is a link that explains it if you choose not to wait... http://www.canslim.net/what.htm   I will say this...and many astute traders will find it strange to consider...but I find it amazing that many of the Warren Buffett principles that I greatly admire...will carry over and work well within the CanSlim approach. This is one I must explain at some point very soon....because surely any experienced trader or speculator reading this will surely be left scratching his head. Let me just say that I totally understand why you would be left confused on that thought.   I will get much more specific and detailed about all this in future blogs. In time, we will understand each other very well. It is just not possible to sort it all out in a single blog entry.  I hope that I can develop relationships through my blogging. I hope that a few of you out there reading this will see the vision that I am putting forth..and at some point you might even consider partnering with Magellan Capital Enterprises. I will at some point(not now) be seeking a few founding partners to help our venture move to more advanced levels. I will not be able to do this alone. Please shoot me e-mails at kevinpickell@lycos.com   Current funds available....  in brokerage account: $722.29  other funds: $36.00  Magellan's total assets: $758.29  More funds coming very soon!!!

       Welcome to this blog. I am Kevin Pickell. My interest and focus is Wall Street.  I live in a small town in NC that is located on the southeastern coast line...perhaps 35-40 miles north of Myrtle Beach, SC. I work in healthcare full time. I am 36 years old. I am married and have have 5 children...two of them from a prior marriage. My wife Lu-Ann is an art teacher with the local public schools.  I believe in the immense power and leverage of Wall Street. I have spent the past 3 and 1/2 years studying the stock market. I have read many books in that time that cover many different philosophies. I have studied all the gurus..to include Buffett, Peter Lynch, Benjamin Graham, William O'Neil, and Jesse Livermore amongst others. The equity markets are just fascinating to me..and I have an insatiable appetite to learn as much as I can. I have finally found what it is that I want to do with the rest of my life. I have found it at age 36...although I spent many years searching. I was beginning to believe that I would never identify my passion...but now I have it!  My goal for this blog is to chronicle my journey to build a large and thriving investment company. The company will be called    Magellan Capital Enterprises    named for one of my favorite historical characters...the Potuguese sea going explorer Ferdinand Magellan. I am to be the portfolio manager and general partner(currently sole partner) of the company. I intend to build my meager capital(over time) into a considerable sum via investments in various equities traded on the various exchanges. I will chronicle every move here on the blog. It's going to be amazing what we are going to create out of very small amount of starting capital. I am nearly emabarrased to disclose that beginning figure to you..but I will do it never the less. The point is that we have to start somewhere. It's more important to get started. Most people never get started. You must put the dream into motion. That is when great things begin to happen.     My long term goal is to turn this company into a billion dollar enterprise. Perhaps one day Magellan will become a publicly traded investment company. Perhaps something like a Berkshire Hathaway or a Leucadia National....which are essentially diversified holding and investment companies. Berkshire Hathaway is the investment vehicle of Warren Buffett. Warren started Berkshire with just $100.00 of his own money way back in the 50's. It was not actually known as Berkshire at the time. It was more or less just a pool of money created by friends and family of Warren Buffett. Mr. Buffett put in $100.00 and assumed the task of managing the pool of money from his home. The Buffett partnership eventually grew(very rapidly) into a multi million dollar enterprise with staggering returns for Buffett's partners. The Buffett partnership was the foundation that would later spur the beginnings of Berkshire Hathaway. Today, over 35 years later, Berkshire Hathaway class A stock is trading on the New York Stock Exchange for approx. $87,000.00 per share. There was a time many years back when you could have purchased a single share for the price of a few pizzas.  I hope that at some point in the future I will attract the interest of others and that they will choose to partner with me in this venture. at some point I will want and need the leverage of others. I hope to ensure that it will be a win/win partnership. If any of you following this blog happen to have any interest in becoming a partner with 'Magellan Capital' then please send me an e-mail at   urlLink  kevinpickell@lycos.com   . From there we can begin discussions to guage your interest and have your questions answered. Magellan is not yet an official corporation at this time..but it will become one at some point in the future. As stated..this is the very beginning of Magellan Capital Enterprises. This is going to be a wonderful and exciting journey. We are going to build something bigger than all of us. It is my hope and dream that it will still be here thriving for future generations..long after I have departed. This is my dream...and here is where my dream begins to take shape, progressing towards reality. The important thing, as I've plainly stated, is to get started. Ships were meant to sail...not to set lifelessly docked in a harbor. We are moving this dream out into open waters. The dream is alive!     In future blog entries I will give a brief run over of my investment philosophy. I will also talk more about how I plan to take this small amount of capital that I have put in Magellan's meager coffers..and pragmatically compound it into very substantial amounts of capital. There are no greater powers than those of compounding figures. As these results are chronicled here, I hope that potential partners will be attracted and come forward to join our exciting venture. My time frame is not in days or weeks. Ben Graham once said.."there are no quick and easy riches on Wall Street or anywhere else". Magellan is not to be confused with a means of quick riches. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither will be Magellan. Like a skyscraper under construction, you build a grand structure one brick at a time..and so we will with Magellan Capital Enterprises. One brick placed over another. We will never quit until this sky scraper known as Magellan is completed. Consider this blog entry as the very first brick!    Current funds available....    in brokerage account: $722.29    other funds: $36.00    Magellan's total assets: $758.29    I anticipate adding some funds to Magellan in the coming days. No investment activity is planned at the current time. Access to the equity markets is available to Magellan via a brokerage account with Ameritrade. Future blogs will chronicle the details of Magellan's investment operations. With such meager capital at the present time, we have to be mindful of commissions involved with equity trading. Commissions tend to become signifigant when starting with smaller capital....and less signifigant as capital grows. Commissions create frictional resistance to small portfolios. We want to raise capital to the point where commissions are far les than 1% of the trade. Current commission rates with Ameritrade are 10.99 per trade. Scottrade offers $7 commission rates. A switch to the lower priced brokerage perhaps will be considered. We want to keep the distribution of Magellan's wealth(or lack there of) to a minimum...and this means being mindful and rational regarding frictional costs such as broker commissions.    This blog will continue!    Keep growing, Kevin L. Pickell
