      The calm within the hurricane is where the peaceful soul resides. Amidst the worry and the turmoil, a womb in which to hide. It’s the sun, shinning brightly above the clouds and storm, burning with desire it heal, caress and warm. The soul is like a prisoner constrained in life’s decay. But love can free the peacefulness enslaved beneath the clay. Resting deep within you like a child yet to be, lies the soul of all tomorrows, yesterdays, and in-betweens. Listen to the moments in the calm within the storm. Let wisdom guide your love to help the peacefulness be born.  This is just my get away, my peace. There is not very many out there for people to run away to. My peace well I guess a lot of others peace is difficult to get to like a storm, and once you reach the eye its calm and quiet.

      I feel like I’m in a small ball in a dark corner. Just when I think everything is alright reality hits me. I wish people wouldn’t hurt me. But I let them…how do you stop it, how do you stop the hurt.  Every time something happens someone I trust breaks it and hurts me. Some times I think if I die I could change it, I could come back better then what I am.  Everyone thinks I’m strong, everyone depends on me. It just makes me weaker. But I have to hide it, stay strong for them, stay strong for me.

      Break down the walls Hear the angels call Lost in a mist of haze Confusion tangled within this maze My life, a complete loss You win, you lose, and it’s up at a toss Where do you travel when all roads are unpaved? No way to escape these paths unscathed Its up to you make it what you will  Run or hide or just sit still But you’ll pay a price for fortune and fame If that ends up to be your game There are choices you’ll make Turns you’ll have to take Heed my warnings, don’t get lost For redirection, there’ll be a cost  Don’t you ever feel like you just can’t win that everything s up to chance. Well that’s how I feel. Everything that happens is unfair. You can’t beat it, alls you can do is play its game. We have choice but what to chose, if you’re wrong you might lose. Ok I hate that when I get talking I start to rhyme. It sucks.

      It’s difficult for me to put into words how I feel, the only way I could think of doing such a thing is to write a poem about how I feel. But to worn you, I hope that you know that these are my original work and half of my poems are published so if you do decide to steal it then you will get caught one way or another. What comes around goes around. Sorry if I sound mean but I have had people try and steal my work and call it there own. I felt like someone had took my soul and stomped on it as if I was never even there to write it; like I did not exist to them.  It’s the worst feeling in the word nonexistence, its nothing that’s it.

      So I sit here in the dark… You made the rules…I played the part. I never pushed or rushed my fate. When times were tight, I knew to wait. With tangled strings I learned to dance. I bid my time and took my chance. Now in the dark I lie awake and watch you drive in deep your stake.  In the dark it all unwinds. I pray for change…for better times. And in my thoughts I sit and dwell. My past is gone…tomorrow’s hell. And all the things you never heard while in my mind, I searched for words. Now time is lost…The curtain fell… I bid Goodnight…and wish you well.  Learning how to survive in the dark is the hardest challenge in anyone’s life. This is my way of dealing with my fears; learning how to endure the dark.

      I sat at a coffee shop, all that night long, I sat at that coffee shop, all alone. I sat at a booth and watched people walk in, short people, tall people, heavy and thin. With only coffee money to my name, I sat at that booth, going insane. When I saw a woman, who looked sadder than I, I felt despair for her, and wanted to cry. She will never know, by her look being sadder, that she made me think about, how things could get better. If it weren't for that coffee shop, at that time and place, I never would have seen that look on her face. If it weren't for that look, who is to say, That I still would be here today.  My mind raced that day; I wondered why I’m still alive why I still breathe. My head throbbed yelling at me to just fade away, away from everything in the world. But just seeing someone with a poignant face helped me realize that it could be worse. But also I feeling compassion for the women who helped me feel better. It’s sick to think that some one got pleasure out of someone else’s pain. But that’s how it works just survival.

      A single soul felt all alone  Never calm, never at home Always abandoned, always in pain Happiness wasn’t a thing he cold claim He got lots of friends and lots of respect If he wanted love, he just had to select  Though still… A single soul felt all alone Never calm, never at home He thought he knew, what affection and love was But then all of a sudden, came an angels sweet touch The best friend ever, a piece of perfection Now he knew about love and affection  A happy soul felt so glad No more problems, never again sad  Sorry if I don’t explain myself in this one but I’m too upset and I might regret what I want to say. So I am just going to leave it at that. And if you do decide to read I’m sorry for keeping you up.

      Please don’t let me cry, For my heart is now alone. You said that I could try, That I should have known.  Please don’t let me cry, I cannot stand a tear. And you twist and tie, You are my greatest fear.  Please don’t let me cry, For now my world is gone. You left me here to die, You stole me from the dawn.  Please don’t let me cry, The cut is now too deep. And now I have to lie, Your hate I have to keep.  Please don’t let me cry, You sit and watch me bleed. I know I should say goodbye, This is not what I need.  Please don’t let me cry, For my heart is now alone. You said that I should try, That I should have known.    In my household there lie’s deep dark secrets that would destroy our perfect little life style that we have so willingly accommodated. Every time something happens I must not show my fear. I’m force to keep it inside growing inside me, eating everything I have and everything I am.  It’s a shame that someone so young must keep this horrid secret from my friends my life. It must be shoved back in the corner were it collects dust and debris.
