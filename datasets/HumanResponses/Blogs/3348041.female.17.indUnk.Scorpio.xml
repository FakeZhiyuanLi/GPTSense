      one of my favorite things to do: listen to jake play his songs. they are just fun. especially when he's drunk. he keeps missing strings. its beautiful.  i just went and saw troy. i loved it. but i must admit my favorite part is when orlando bloom's character goes from paris, prince of troy, to legolas...THE MOST AWESOME ELF EVER! i guess you have to look closely, but its there. he's all like ooh.. im the pussy of the movie...everyone else gets to be badasses... then WHAM!!!! he whips out his bow and arrow and goes all legolas style. i was waiting for him to like slide down some stairs on a shield shooting all the greeks with arrows but it never happened. orlando bloom, you're blackened locks of curls don't fool me... i know you'll always be an elf.   so its monday night and i only have aprrox. 6 hours until i'm officially senior. i'm so excited. but f finals. i dont even think im gonna try. i just really dont even care anymore.   so here's the skinny. i've been drunk since thursday. not so much anymore, but i still have a decent buzz going on. we went to chili's today for some post-drinking grub and when we walked in there was like a tunnel of chili's employees surrounding us. i kid you not, i was waiting for them to like put their arms up and everything like the parents used to do at little soccer games. it kinda freaked me out though. especially when im thinking, shit the only reason they are doing this is cuz they know im fucked up. how do they know? those shady bastards...  and now here's the fatty... sam and catherine broke up. :( i don't know what to think. i dunno. im just confused. more on that later.  song right now: jake's little diddy- untitled: "angels rolled the dice, time was on our side. angels take me away, my happy day." hehe  bed time.

      well, i am just giddy right now. for no reason really.. just giddy. i love the internet.it brings forth all sorts of surprises. like micheal ryan. i love michael ryan.  micheal ryan is crazy. the craziest kind of crazy, i'd like to add. one of his goals is to meet the king of the rats.... and he's completely serious. nonetheless, i love this person. his plan is for us to get married when i come back to california. what a nut. hehe... but i would tap that...5 times... in the snow. lol  when i become a mom i want to be like the mom in "the boondock saints." you won't see much of the mom unless you watch the deleted scenes. she has twins and never tells them which one came out first. this is hilarious to me. i want to play all sorts of tricks like that on my children. maybe i should blame drugs for that one.. but oh well. and she calls them up all drunk on st. patty's day and pretends she's gonna kill herself. i think i have a sick sense of humor but its hilarious. i guess you'd have to see it. and so then at the end of the conversation, they ask her the question: "after 27 years, could you please tell us!! which one of us came out first?" and after a long silence she decides to tell them. the mood is all serious and you are going to find out if murphy or connor is older... and she responds.. "The one with the bigger cock!! HAH!" what a great mom  i want school to be done. officially. i'm so tired of it. i just want it to die. shit i have sat's coming up again. oh well.   i think i'm going to call ethan tonight. i miss him dearly.  Lets add a recent ethan quote:   I miss you too.  There are times when i think about how much different my year would have been if you were around this year.  You would have stopped me from doing so many stupid things, and probably got me to do so many more stupid, but awesome things.  One thing i miss was that you were always kinda apart from the rest of my group of friends, and we never really had issues for extended periods of time, so like i could come hang out with you and ur fridge of goodies and ur movie collection and ur dog, and then we could go swimming, lay in your front yard, and then maybe help your mom write a witty passage about bears for her scrapbook.  mmmm.....I miss you.    I guess that really only makes sense to me... but i love it. ::sigh::  song right now: bronco tatonka: "bitten lip"  fare-the-well

      i can never think of a clever or witty title that goes along with each entry, especially cuz there is not one title that can go along with  one   seeing as they are all so random. that's ok though. i prefer to choose random songs. like today. mmm avenged sevenfold. they played here not too long ago, alas.. i missed that one. tomorrow from autumn to ashes, 18 visions (i think) and atreyu are playing. sadly, i think i might miss that one too. oh well  lets see... only 5 more days and 4 finals left of school. i am beyond stoked for school to end. i need it to be summer. although next year is gonna blow cuz i'm taking a full schedule with three college classes. i think i'm going to kill myself. oh well... i guess it happens. not the killing myself.... the hard classes.. yah.  i'm also looking forward to this weekend :) hello empty house :)  ok, sam seriously needs to call me back. he's getting his license right now and i am supposed to hang out with him.  when he called they were on 41 and he is number 44. ok seriously, what is with the long lines at those places? i mean, its not that hard to work efficiently. i dont understand.   jake came back from california yesterday. i'm gladcuz i missed him, but i'm so jealous. he was full of all sorts of stories like a grandpa is full of war stories. except my grandpa, he didn't fight in the war. he does yodel though. anyway... one night they were at this party and there were prolly 600 people there and there were all sorts of fights breaking out and then finally a police chopper flew over. obviously everyone decided to bone the fuck out at that point.  imagine that image from a helicopter's point of view... youre lookin down on a house and then all of a sudden 400 people are so just flood out. thats silly. i miss everyone that he was talking about. i miss nickle and kyle and mikey rein and tommy tom.... mmm tommy tom. i must say i miss that kid especially. that was definitely fun while it lasted....  ok, let's give a little story about tommy tom... aka tommy storing. mmmm he is one fine mofo.  he is one of my brothers good friends... eh, best friends really. and like, i have known him since my freshman year prolly but we just started hanging out last year or so. and like, one night he was rollin with lindsey and nick and kyle and i was like duuuude tommy whats up!! i havent seen you in forever!! (really like 2 weeks or so) and so i was like we need to chill again, and he's like lemme get your number. so i wrote my number on his hand and i get his number. end of story really... well not really, end of that story. so the next morning im chillin in bed and i get a call and sure enough, it's tommy! so we decide to meet up at yorba reg and we are just walking around talkin and such and like he keeps dropping little hints that being the moron i am, i totally dont pick up on. until finally he's like so would you ever consider dating any of your brothers friends? and in my head i was like..ohh i know what youre asking.  and so then he goes on to tell me that he's had a crush on me for a long time, even before he knew i was jake's sister, and bla bla bla... one thing led to another and we were fully makin out in the park... but we had to be careful cuz a lot of our friends hung out there... anyway... that summer ended up containing a lot of tommy-fucking. in fact, he was the last person i had sex with before i moved out here. i think if jake knew that, he'd murder me/tommy. that would be bad. one time i almost told jake but i'm really glad i didn't. that could have ended badly.  its so weird to think that was almost a whole year ago though. weird.   song right now: juliana theory- if i told you this was killing me  ok time to go. peace

      i always tend to post these late at night. but i guess it really doesn't matter for the reader. you could read it at midnight or at 3:35 in the afternoon and it really wouldn't make a difference whether or not i posted something in the wee hours of the morning. oh well.  saturdays are nice, even when the bee of apple's lags. work was a tid bit slow. i think i made some money, not a lot, but some. i'm halfway finished paying my mom back for all the tickets... then california... here i come!  i saw van helsing today. i enjoyed it because i enjoyed the action scenes. the final battle scene with hugh jackman as a werewolf and dracula was nothing short of badass. the movie itself wasn't all that good. kate beckinsale's translvanian accent... not a fan.  out of my 13 buddies online, 12 of them have an away message on. let's pick my favorite.  ivanputzy: "gambling illegally." kudos aaron, i hope you win big. strip poker anyone?   i can't wait until next week. my parents will be in vegas? party @my house??? NO! OF COURSE NOT! that would be wrong. meh... >:)    song right now: modest mouse- "float on" i don't think i could live without this song.  how did i survive up until it was written? i have no idea. its all a blur. i must have been chriogenically frozen until its release. that is really the only option.  is it wrong to have stupid pointless crushes that don't mean anything? kind of like a celebrity crush... but not quite a celebrity. i guess someone unattainable, per se.  like ryan. he is my new manager at work. dear lord he's a hottie. i'd like to hit that... 5 times... in the snow. mmmm and then there's also... eh maybe i shouldn't say it. oh well.  church tomorrow. goodnight.

      so i guess i've joined the blog nation. go me. i always get a kick out of reading emily's so i figured why not start one of my own. i don't think my mom even knows what a blog is so i don't have to worry about that. let's not tell all the lovely people of faith christian school about this though cuz i think i could get in trouble if i post my thoughts, so why the hell would i censor what's going on in my head for everyone else. emily is cool. you may read this. hi emily!   i heart emily. she makes texas bearable... cool even.   mmm friday nights. school is almost out and then i'm a senior. that's so awkward. this time next year, i will be so free. i've always thought that i would be counting down the days to my graduation but now that i think about it, it is overwhelming.  what's really creepy is i've always seen myself going far away to new york. i want to go to new york so badly. i know that if i don't go for college, i'll never go.  everything inside of me wants to travel to new york and experience my whole college existence in that new environment.  so what's stopping me? money? i could manage... parents? they want me gone too... JP. yes. i love JP with everything inside of me, and that scares me. i've never been so in love with anyone than i am with him. it just freaks me out that i would put aside everything that i've always dreamt of for a boy. i've always wanted to be super successful and held my future above all other things. i always told myself that my career and all that jazz would take precedence over all things... even boys. but now... i don't know. it's completely different. i'm willing to put my whole life on hold for him. i'm willing to do anything just to see him smile. this whole thing is just overwhelming, but in a good way.  "i know now how to spend my love." fuck you sound of music.  goulet  song right now: san francisco::alkaline trio.  "i was drinkin jill goodbye."  oh how i hope emily finds that book... for her sake and for mine. i would simply adore it if the whole staff of faith christian school read my advice on the female and male orgasm. but hey, i guess if i could give them some advice to... ya know, anything to help.   i guess i should stop this whole insomnia business. peace.

      what an entry this is. this is the special Vans Warped Tour 2004 edition of my blog. oh my god this tour was amazing. i cannot freaking wait until next year.   so anyway, we get there at like 11 cuz that's when it started... obviously. (side note: "we" being jake and myself).  so we walk around forever and search for the main stage cuz it was hidden. then we hike over this little hill, and that's when it happened... the rain came pouring down. it was raining cats and dogs and everyone was seeking shelter underneath tents and what not and it was just crazy cuz we were all getting soaking wet. Did that stop us from seeing IMA robot at 12:30? I THINK NOT! Last time i saw ima was at the house of blues in anaheim with hot hot heat. they were freaking awesome and it was the first time i was exposed to them. this time when i saw them, i knew every freaking song (with the exception of one). the lead singer, alex ebert, moves like mikey rein and is the sexiest guy i've ever seen with a mullet. i danced my ass off in the pouring rain and loved every second of their set. i must say i'm a loyal fan.  shortly after, we decide to seek shelter underneath a tent seeing as the rain was coming down in insane amounts.  while we were deciding what band to see next and what to do, who comes walking by? Alex Ebert!!! i was like, "dude jake look!" and he walked right by us and i was like "Hey! You're show was freaking awesome dude. I'm such a huge fan!!" It was awesome.  I met the lead singer of IMA robot.  Next on the list... well there was a slight lull in the schedule and we weren't quite sure what to do.  alkaline trio didn't come on until 4 so it was either check out merch and new bands or go dry off. we chose the latter of the two and chilled underneath the volcom stage (it was sheltered) to dry off. oh, bummer of the day: seeing as i was dripping with water, so were all of my possessions. all my cigarettes died... soaking wet, and my cell phone broke too. it blows. anyway, we sat for awhile, and then walked around and stuff.  ooh then we saw this crazy band but it sucked cuz their mikes stopped working midset.  but yah, they were dressed all crazy like and the trombone player was mega sexy in his own little way. they were obviously local but i really enjoyed them and they started up a little clappy thing and not many people in the audience started clapping along but i so did, cuz ya gotta support the bands, and like i was the only girl in the audience clapping along, and then mr. pretty trombone player saw me and was like "fuck yah!" and he blew a kiss at me and mouthed "i love you." it was so rock star. then... oh then... alkaline trio. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm but we'll come back to that  so alkaline... then story of the year played. since we were uber close for alk, i ended up being front row for story of the year. they were sooo freakin awesome. the guitar player did all sorts of nutty tricks and was like all over the stage, on top of amps... the whole works. it was cool. and the lead singer... ohhhh damnnn. sooo hot. and since i was front row he like stuck his hands out and everything and i got to touch him and everything. AND THEN he jumps into the crowd and crowd-surfed!!! i soooo got to grab his ass!!!!!! i was just so happy!!! but then i almost died cuz someone crowd surfed and she landed on me (fat bitch) and i fell so it really hurt. but oh well...anyway, they played all sorts of amazing songs.  and yah, that was story of the year.  ok, back to alkaline trio!!!! we got there when new found glory (kill myself) was playing and had to suffer through their set. it was horrid. but then everyone left to go to the other stage to see yellowcard and so we moved up to like the front. i think we were about six people away from the front. so 4:00 approaches, and they come on and it was just amazing!!! they all looked so hot in their little black dress shirts with white collars and spiffy ties.  it was rad!!!! and they played like all of my favorite songs. it was simply wonderous. oh, but the best part is yet to come. there was like an hour before story of the year came on so i wanted to get some air and what not. so jake and i are walking away from the crowd and who do we see walking in front of us??? MATT FUCKING SKIBA!!!! it was awesome. i wanted to run up and just take advantage of him... 18 times... mmm. so jake's like "dude matt!" and he turns around and we go up to him and tell him what a great show it was and bla bla bla. he was sooo nice. and we told a little white lie cuz like nick and kyle told me and jake all about the alkaline trio/nofx show at the paladium (sp?) in so cal and we were like, oh yah, that was the best show we'd ever been to!!! and so we talked to him even longer about california and all sorts of stuff. it was so cool, but then he left and i was like... wow. my night is complete. fuck that, my life is complete. i can die happy.  so that was the awesome awesomeness of the night. i mean, there were a lot of other good bands there too. taking back sunday kicked ass,  bad religion was just amazing, plus mucho mucho more. and that was my warped tour experience. what a great day.  peace

      well its summer. look at me go. finally getting on the computer and such. i haven't drafted a blog dealie in a while so here goes. go me.   well JP and I are back together. :) yay. best make up sex ever. hehe mmmm. that's really all that's going on there.  other than JP, i haven't been doing much of anything. Working... yay. not. I hate applebee's. they are shady bastards. i've been begging to do ToGo for like 3 months now and they said i could and everything but they are all saying different things now and its pissing me off but i finally got the GM glenn to agree to it, now its just a matter of putting me on the schedule but mark the flaming ass pirate won't put me on the schedule. its quite aggravating. and then TODAYYYYYY they flat out asked this chick dana to do ToGo. it made me angry. very Very VERY angry. but who wants to hear about that? i certainly dont.   song in my speakers: the postal service- nothing better  i miss my dear california friends. especially seeing as its summer. i mean, i have much more time to think about that.  and also i dont have any real friends here so it makes it harder. you know i thought i did but when no one calls you back and everyone is too busy with their own thing, it really makes you think otherwise.  christa is supposed to come visit in the near future... july 16 or 17 tenatively... but when she wont respond to me, it makes it that much harder as well. it would be nice if i could see my best friend... but i dont think i really have a best friend anymore. oh well. it happens  check out Q and not U. its an AMAZING band.   back to this friend issue. i love story of the year. but another thing that makes me so sad is one of their songs. cuz its totally reminds me of my friends... or lack thereof.. think of it how you will.  but yah... Page Avenue.. great song:   I still recall every summer night like it was yesterday. The time could never end and my friends were family. Nothing mattered more then the loyalty we had. Now I'm a world away from everything we shared.  I had something better waiting ahead. I try to take control of my heart. I had something better, But i'll tear it down and I'll tape it up by my own design. I fall.  Bring back the days. Three story parking lot. The air is never dry. As the city falls asleep days bleed into the night. The table set the stage for a life of memories, But I'm a world away from everything.   I fall apart as time passes by. I fall apart but the memories never die.    that pretty much explains EXACTLY how i'm feeling. but thats ok. life is shitty right now. and i think it's meant to be that way. its like people don't even realize i exist anymore. i'm getting quite tired of people not listening to me, or what's worse; acting like they are listening but then pass me and what i say as nothing. it makes me sad. oh well. what else is there to do but deal with it?  kill myself... yah right.  the pessimism in this room is suffocating. maybe i should open a window or something.

      well, that's weird. who ever thought the title of one my blogs would be a Britney spears song.  but dude, i love this song.  i can't help it. I mean cmon, she dies in the video (kind of). but don't worry. i fixed it. i'm no longer listening to britney spears. yay afi.  but seriously, i feel like so much crap. that song is like exactly how i feel. i think i need to get it all out because i surely have not told anyone else.  JP and i broke up... kind of. it was initiated by me and i feel absolutely wretched about it.  well, i cheated on him with sam.  the guilt was just overwhelming and i couldn't deal with it.  i can't tell him that happened cuz it would hurt him more than anything. his old gf used to cheat on him all the time and i didn't mean for it to happen... but it did. and now im obviously a horrible person. we are just on a break right now, but it still hurts.  we've been apart for like 3 days and i miss him so much already. i really do love him alot. i hate not being together. i hate that i did that. if i tell him, he will never forgive me... i know it. and i dont know how to initiate our reconciliation. ironic... i had no problem initiating our estrangement.   and everytime i try to fly, i fall without my wings, i feel so small i guess i need you, baby and everytime i see you in my dreams i see your face, you're haunting me i guess i need you baby  ::sigh... i love JP
