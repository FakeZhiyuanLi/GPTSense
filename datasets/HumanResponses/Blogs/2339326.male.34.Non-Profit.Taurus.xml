       i'm packing for assessment.  my attitude about the whole thing stinks and i already miss my boys.  pray for me (us).  deep inside i have this really good feeling that God is going to do something good through all of this, but i seem to dwell on my surface feelings instead.    i had a lot of visitors in grandview yesterday.  first, tami and alison.  then, doug.  it couldn't have come on a better day.  eric was gone from 8:30 am until about midnight.  it would have been a really lonely day if my community hadn't been around.  you guys are my family and i love you all.  kerri

       No need to bring a dessert tomorrow night. McKenna is going to be hanging out with us all day and her and Riley are going to make 4th of July cupcakes.  So, just bring a side dish of some sort.  We are grilling pork chops, but we can throw a burger or hotdog on for anyone who doesn't like pork chops. As for Red, White and Boom--Eric has to work until 7:30 so he will be meeting us there before the fireworks.  I will be leaving from 827 NW Blvd. at approximately 4:30.  If any of you get off work early and would like to meet at my house that would be great!

       Two things for this week: 1. Wednesday night at the Stetler's--we'll have meat for the grill and drinks.  Bring a side dish or dessert. Directions: take 670 to Grandview Ave. exit Turn Right onto Grandview Ave.  Take another right at Goodale.  Take a left and Northwest Blvd.  We are 827 Northwest Blvd.  You can make a u-turn right past our apartment and park on the street.   2.  Friday night--RED, WHITE, AND BOOM! One of my very favorite nights of the year.  Three Stetler's will be there (Trey has a sitter).  The traditional Stetler/Pressley spot to watch the fireworks is right outside City Center.  There is a corner where buildings are painted on the walls with a huge grassy area.  We love it because it's a pretty good view and not very crowded. We like to spend the evening there, pack our dinner, and relax.  We will be there around 4:30 pm. Come, bring some snacks to share if you want, and blanket, and a frisbee.  I think Chris and Amanda Copeland will be there too, so it should be a lot of fun to see them again.

       I got a call from my mom about an hour ago.  She told me that my sister, Alyssa, had outpatient surgery today at OSU East.  That was a suprise!  Apparently she had a lump removed from her breast and when the doctors got in there, it was somehow unusual and different from what they expected.  I don't know what that means, but they have decided to keep her for the night for observations and testing.  Please pray for her.  I hope we aren't going through all this again.

       Hello to everyone!  There has been a change of plans for next week.  As you probably already read, Kerri's dad turns 50 on Monday and she thinks she should be with her family instead... Happy B'day Mike! Instead of Monday, we are getting together on Wednesday at Eric and Karri's place.  I'm sure Kerri will post directions and other details later.  I just wanted to let everyone know so you can plan to be there.  Also, if you have nt yet made plans for Red. White, and Boom, a group of us will be meeting downtown.  More info on that will also follow.  Apparently Ryan is back in town.  He emailed me and said he was gone for 10 days to work at the US Open....what?  I want to know more about this.  Ryan, if you're reading, what's the scoop?

       I made a mistake! Monday the 28th is my dad's 50th birthday.  So, we won't be able to meet here that night.  I don't want to screw up your monday/wednesday rotation, but we could meet here on Wednesday.  Or, someone else could do Monday and we could do the next Wednesday.  Something to think about, we can talk about it tonight! Can't wait to see you guys!

       Next week we will be getting together on Wednesday at Alison and Sharon's apartment.  Will one of you please post directions in the comment section.  We don't have a food theme this week so how about we all bring our own food this week and plan to all be there so we can all eat together at about 6:30 pm.  We have decided to get together on Mondays and Wednesdays of alternating weeks.  Since we are meeting next week on Wednesday (June 23), we will get together the following week on Monday (June 28).  Do we have any volunteers to host us on the 28th?

       how would everyone feel about expanding the online community to those who have moved.  Kerri and I feel that we are still connected to you or "plugged in" as some might say, but I would like to see ryan, chris and amanda, bruce, and others posting their thoughts from anywhere, usa.  what do you think?

       I finally made it on.  You know I went back to work part time this week.  I found out they aren't letting me have my complete job back because they don't think I can handle radiation and a full time job.  Well the challenge is out! They assume I will be there only this week and then gone.  Let the challenge begin.  By the way pray that I can keep this up.  If other people can work and do radiation so can I. I just love this Blog  Debbie

       Each day this week has felt like it has lasted forever. My dad is off work this week to "help" with my mom. The past two days I have been painting the back bedroom for Alexis. Monday wasn't too bad and I had more kids that day. Tuesday I only had three kids and none of them were infants so my mom could watch the kids without doing anything. I painted while the kids were sleeping and then Kohl's called and asked me to work. I went to work at 6 and got home at 10:45. I'm back at it again today. With only four kids my mom can keep an eye on them and my dad and I have been back painting. My back is starting to show the effects of the last two days and I still have to work tonight. I don't really regret my decision to help my mom. This sounds weird but I am looking forward to the different experiences I am going to go through in the next couple months. I should go see what the kids are doing.(I should at least make sure they aren't tearing down the house;) I hope everyone is having a great, faster moving week.

Let me know where you are meeting.  Then the next week is at our place.  I'm sure you guys had a great time last night.  How was Doug's pizza?

       what are we doing when we meet together?  why would we continue such tomfoolery week in and week out?  What holds us together?  What keeps us from moving on to another spiritual family for a while?  What keeps us from just staying home and watching tv, reading a book, the bible even?  Lord knows that would be so much easier.   ... blog this.

       Douglas, We are waiting anxiously for a word on how your retreat went.  I think this computer is signed in as eric, but this is actually kerri.    Girls--(and any guys who might be interested)--I'm ready to plan a shopping trip.  We could still do the Eastland thrift store trip--another option, Rag a Rama.  I haven't been there but I hear it is awesome.  That is where we were headed the day Eric totalled the car!  Any takers?  Any date suggestions?  I'm booked this Friday and Saturday, Sunday is an option.

       Alison and I wanted to invite everyone over Tuesday (JUne 8) for group at our house. I sent out a regular email but thought I would try it out on here too. We are planning on having pizza so all you would have to do is bring money and we will provide the drinks and dessert.

       Eric stole my thunder.  I couldn't wait to blog about our week but by the time I got our internet back up and running he had already beat me to it.  I'm going to blog anyway!  Thank you so much for your prayers this week.  God shocked us to say the least.  We met some unbelievable people who became good friends in three short days.  We were able to mess with their heads some as they considered the definition of "church." We passed our evaluation with a score higher than most receive and never had to compromise who we are or what we believe to be true kingdom living.   There is a lot more to say about the details of the week, but that we'll be some good stories next time we see all of you.  We love you. Kerri

       a quick update... blogging from the cafe @ kenyon college.  i guess you could say that kerri and i were somewhat surprised at what happened this past week here.  I you would have told us that we would actually like the kind of people that would show up at an event like this we would have told you that you "didn't understand."  we totally expected to be misunderstood, rejected, and "red-flagged", but none of these things happened.  the director told us that our presence was influencial not only to those involved in the assesment with us but also to the process itself!  they affirmed our passion and calling and gave us unconditional approval to plant simple churches under the banner of nazarenedom.  this, we did not expect.  so this means that our relationship with the nazarenes is developing.  it still isn't the focus by anymeans... they would like it to be, but if we begin to listen to the voices that say, "if you build this thing up, if you are a success, if you crack this case of 'urban planting', then we will hold you up as a model for the denomination..." then we have taken the bait of significance in the eyes and arenas of man... lord help us to continue to be us.

       I am excited that we did this. Thank you Doug! I am so worried that I won't get to see anyone this summer because of my psychotic work schedule. Wednesday, June 9th is the date for my mom's surgery. I am watching her kids Monday and Tuesday, off Wednesday just in case something happens and I have to go to the hospital, and then I am watching them Thursday and Friday. Kohls is being wonderful about giving me hours so I can still pay my bills. If you all could remember my family I would greatly appreciate it.

       One more month of summer and then I go back to the daycare. This summer has been crazy as most of you know. I feel like all I do is pick up after people. I unload the dishwasher&nbsp; when I get to my mom's and load it throughout the day as we have breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner. The majority of nights I don't even get to eat dinner with my family. I have to get ready and leave for work before my family eats. I have turned most of the cooking over to my mom so I don't have that to deal with&nbsp; anymore.&nbsp; I go to work at Kohl's and pick up after customers who are to lazy to pick up after themselves. After folding clothes at work I find it very difficult to clean my own room at home. I did find away around that though, if I fold my clothes before I go to work I am more likely to put them away when I get home.&nbsp; Since moving into the apartment with Alison I found it very hard to sit down and relax when I know there is something I could be doing. There are nights when I get home and cannot go to bed until I empty the dishwasher. Not because I think Alison won't do it because I know she would but because it is something that I know should be done and I have the time to do it. I remember when I used to be able to sleep till noon or later and wouldn't care if I had something to clean. I could sit and watch tv without worrying about anything. Am I getting old or just taking responsibility?

       I think we all agreed, at least those who where there Monday and blogged on here, that Wednesday the 11th would work. Do you want me to go to Kroger and get the tickets? I need to know exactly how many people to get tickets for. Kerri, is your mom going to be able to make it? Another thing we need to think about is how we are going to get there. It would save us on parking if we went together, but we need to figure out a time, place to meet, and who can drive. If you have any ideas on any of this please let me know. I need to get the tickets before the start of the fair to get them at the reduced price. If you could blog, email, or call me and let me know that would be great.  Fair food here we come!

       Our group get-together on Monday was a great way to refresh oneself.&nbsp; Present was Sharon, Debbie, McKenna, Katie, Brian, and myself.&nbsp; It was great to see some people that we haven't seen for a few weeks.&nbsp; I really do miss people when they are not around.&nbsp; I hope we can get a few more people there next week.   As you already know, we decided that we will get together every Monday at Alison and Sharon's apartment, so everyone knows what day and location.&nbsp; Next Monday will be low-carb Lasagna night.&nbsp; I'm skeptical in the products but have great faith in Sharon's cooking ability.&nbsp; It will be a small adventure that we will all go on together.&nbsp; Please add whatever you plan to bring in the comment section.   We also decided to assign each person a week to share their "story".&nbsp; We did this in the past, but we have a few people that were not around then.&nbsp; We want to hear their stories and they want to hear ours, so we will all do this again.&nbsp; This time, we can expand and perhaps get into issues we were tentative about bringing up last time.&nbsp; Sharon has volunteered to go first and will have the spotlight this Monday. (Yes, Sharon volunteered.&nbsp; She wasn't coerced into going first this time.)&nbsp; After this we will all begin talking about where we are and how we can help each other move forward.&nbsp;   I think we are starting to get back to the feeling of this being "church" for each other.&nbsp; This is good.

       I hope by writing the menu for next week this early we will accomplish two things: (1) People will sign up to bring things and (2) People will come. Last night Debbie, McKenna, ALison and I had a fun time. Next week we are going to have a Mexican theme. Debbie said she will bring the seasoned meat.&nbsp; I hope you all can come, just respond with what you can bring and we can go from there.&nbsp; I hope everyone is having a good week.&nbsp; I think Erin Ledbetter, a girl from high school, might be coming with her daughter Emma.&nbsp;

       Since no one wrote about dinner Debbie and I decided on chicken. I will make baked chicken marinated in italian dressing and Debbie said she will bring salad.&nbsp; We have dressings so you don't need to bring any Debbie.&nbsp; I hope you can come. If you need directions and/or have any questions call me @ 596-8082.

       Now that I know Katie is going, I'm definitely in! Debbie, could we do a week night? I know Sharon can't do the first weekend of the fair and I'll be out of town the second weekend.&nbsp; Is there a particular week night that might work better than the others?&nbsp; I assume we are doing no kids this year? I can take Riley to see the animals on a different day so that our eating doesn't get interrupted by horses and&nbsp;sheep.&nbsp; He was well behaved when we went last year, but I'd enjoy a girls night.

       Okay Ladies and anyone else who wants to venture out with us. I read the other day at Kroger(yes the same day that guy walked up to me) that they have a special on prepurchased fair tickets when you use your kroger plus card. You can get tickets for $8 I think, but anyway if you buy four tickets you get one free. Let me know when is good for you all. I have to watch the Settele girls the 6-8th of August but any other time is good with me. Just let me know so I can call Heather R. and get off work. I'm sad that I won't get to see any of you this week but I'll have great Settele stories when we get together next Monday. Love you all!

       Just thought I would finally let you know what I have been up to this summer.  Crazy, I tell you.  Right now I am working mad hours at MCE.  I have a set schedule Thursday thruSaturday working in the registration department.  And I am also working at a tech. In the ER wiping butts, getting urine samples, and collecting blood.  Sounds like fun huh?  Actually I'm loving it.  I know what you're thinking.  I'm special. But, while I'm working in two different departments I'm also taking classes that the hospital requires.  Waste of time!    Any ways I'm on the go all the time it seems.  It seems every summer flies by!  Darn those flutter bies!  I also miss you guys tons:)  Hopefully we can all get together soon.  David is also doing well.  He is officially a R.N. and working in the ER.  He is great at it, but I have never seen him so stressed.  I'm sure he'll settle in soon, he just has a lot of responsibilities.

       How would you feel if we changed the schedule of dinners to Monday nights at Alison and my apartment. We won't start this until July 19th, which is the following Monday. That means we will skip this week so we can have more time to let everyone know about the changes. I will post another blog about what we will have that night so if you have any suggestions please let me know.

       I figured out why we aren't getting more people to come to our dinners. I was at Kroger getting stamps and a raincheck when a man came up to me and told me I was "looking good". I had never seen him before. His next question caught me completely off guard and is the reason for my first sentence of this blog. He asked me if I was Catholic and then when I said no he said I should be. I told him I would try to work on that. He said something about be a member of the Knights something, I had never heard of them. It was an interesting encounter and I wanted to share that with you all.

       I read this devotional last night after the small gathering we had at our house last night. I felt during some of the conversation like I was completely lost and had no clue what the solution was to the issue before our community. It amazes me how I can feel one moment that I am miles away in a desert completely away from communication with God and the next moment He's saying "Wake up stupid,(even though He wouldn't be so mean)I'm telling you exactly what you need to do if you would only listen."  See what you all think of what Oswald Chambers has to say:  We always have visions before a thing is made real. When we realize that although the vision is real, it is not real in us, then is the time that Satan comes in with his temptations, and we are apt to say it is no use to go on. Instead of the vision becoming real, there has come the valley of humiliation.               Life is not as idle ore,               But iron dug from central gloom,               And batter'd by the shocks of doom               To shape and use. God gives us the vision, then He takes us down to the valley to batter us into the shape of the vision, and it is in the valley that so many of us faint and give way. Every vision will be made real if we will have patience. Think of the enormous leisure of God! He is never in a hurry. We are always in such a frantic hurry. In the light of the glory of the vision we go forth to do things, but the vision is not real in us yet; and God has to take us into the valley, and put us through fires and floods to batter us into shape, until we get to the place where He can trust us with the veritable reality. Ever since we had the vision God has been at work, getting us into the shape of the ideal, and over and over again we escape from His hand and try to batter ourselves into our own shape.  The vision is not a castle in the air, but a vision of what God wants you to be. Let Him put you on His wheel and whirl you as He likes, and as sure as God is God and you are you, you will turn out exactly in accordance with the vision. Don't lose heart in the process. If you have ever had the vision of God, you may try as you like to be satisfied on the lower lever, but God will never let you.

       OK, here is what I know from the comments left and from speaking with people. Monday - Neither Alison nor Sharon are available. Tuesday - Doug is not available Wednesday - Alison is not avaliable Thursday - Neither Doug nor Katie are avaibale Friday - Katie is not avaiable I have not heard from anyone else. Here is my recommendation.   Meet Tuesday night.   This has worked is the past and still seems to work best for most people.  I recommend meeting at Alison and Sharon's place, but you two need to confirm if this is ok or not.  As far as food, that's up to you guys/gals. What I am really trying to do is set up a time so everyone is available to get together.  I miss seeing Ryan, Tami, Brian, Melissa, Sean, Mikey, etc. Is there a weekend day or night that might work for everyone?  Perhaps we can set up a web calendar so everyone can post nights they are available.   Please, everyone who gets this blog or email, leave a comment or reply back with the evenings you are available next week (Sat. the 10th thru Fri. the 16th).

       Hello everyone!  I know many of us are getting together this Friday for Red, White, and Boom, but I wanted to start making plans for next week. I know many of us have had a hard time getting together due to schedules, but I would like to try to get all of us together on whatever day is possible.  I can't get together on Tuesday or Thursday, but if the rest of you prefer one of these days, that would be great.  Please reply in the comment section with the days you are available and if you would be able to host the group on any particular days.  If we cal all reply by Saturday night, we can set the date and place and post it late Saturday or Sunday morning.  Thanks!  I really hope we can all get together.

       On Monday night, we had Alison, Brian, Debbie, Doug, and Sharon. Sharon shared her story with us. I learned a lot about Sharon. This was a great way to kick off our new rounds of stories. We also had the infamous low-carb lasagna, which turned out to be very good.  Next week, Brian will share with us. I hope all can make it. We also decided that next week will be burger week. Please leave a comment to let us know what you will bring.

      What a great day.  My entire life, this has been one of my favorite holidays.  For myself, this day affords an opportunity to visit family for the simple enjoyment of spending time together and eating.  Today, I feel the obligation to discuss what I am thankful for.  Of course, I am thankful for the typical things the people mention: family, friends, food and shelter, etc., but I feel so very grateful for so much that I cannot hardly begin a list.  I am also grateful for having so many things to be grateful for.  However, hat I am thinking about today is, "why am I thankful for those things?"   I am thankful for family because there is a special bond there.  Even though we are all different people and all live very different lives, there is a special connection.  Perhaps this is because we have all just known each other for so long and had many of the same experiences.  Perhaps it is even a longing to return to the days when my life was more innocent.  Either way, I am thankful for family.  I am thankful for food and shelter for the obvious reasons.  I could not do without it.  Sometimes it seems like I am on the brink of not having these, but I always seem to get by just fine.  I am thankful for friends because the people I hang out with are just that, friends.  They are not just people like me that like to be together.  We do help each other when we need it and we push each other to become better people.  On Sunday, friends and I were discussing what we are thankful for and what we worry about.  The purpose was to express thanks for what we have and to lay out our worries and place them in the hands of God so that we don't need to worry about them anymore.  I may have been the only one in the group to not speak up.  As I previously wrote, I have plenty to be thankful for.  However, I was too worried about what the group would think if I told them what I was really worried about (Yes, I am and was aware of the irony at the time).  This is what I worry about: At the time, I was thinking that what I worry about is that I am 33 years old and not married.  I thought I would be married and have a family five years ago.  It has not worked out the way I planned it.  Also, even though I am a guy, I think my time for having kinds is coming to a close.  I wasn't so interested in getting married when I was younger and I used all the excuses (I'm too busy for a relationship, etc.) and now I feel that I have missed my chance.  It seems all the good women I meet are already married.  I'm sure there are good women out there, but I don't know where to meet them.  That seems to sound funny coming from a guy.  I also tend to think that a women that I would want to date, would not likely want to date me.  After all, I'm not wealthy, I'm not good looking.  I am somewhat intelligent, but that seems to matter little to some women if it doesn't correlate to income (sorry, that was very cynical).  I guess when it come down to it, I believe that if I don't get married and if I don't have a family, I will still have friends and I can still be valuable, but my life won't really matter much to others.  Which means. . . my life really won't matter much.  On top of all this, I worry that I won't ever stop worrying about this.  This is probably way too personal and honest to post on the web, but I am doing so because I didn't mention it last Sunday when I should have.  I also want to add that I do trust in God, but I wish I had a better view of the future sometimes and I wish I had a better understanding of what God's role is for me.

      I need discipline.  This is something I never imagined saying as a child.  Normally when I use the word discipline, I mean self-control over the mundane, rote areas of everyday life.  I need to get up and exercise in the morning.  I need get to bed on time.  I need to plan my days before I go to bed.  I need to read my bible daily.  And I do mean this.  I also mean I need to be disciplined.  I need to be guided by someone wiser than me.  I need to be corrected when I stray onto the wrong path.  I need to be punished when I do wrong and rewarded when I do right.  But I am not a child.  I don’t need an adult to help me get through life.  In fact, this kind of guidance from another would likely be rejected with a sense of self-righteous condemnation of the advisor for thinking me the fool that I am.  I seem to react the same way to the one from who I should be taking guidance.  The root of discipline is disciple.  I’m not really looking for a leader, what I need is much more difficult, I need to be a follower.  The world offers up many undeserving ‘want-to-bes’ who are willing and desirous to lead anyone who will follow.  I don’t need them.  I need to be the leader and the only way is to follow.  A wise man once said, “follow me,” and the world has never been the same.  To lead, I must follow.  By following, I lead.  It seems like a highway under construction at rush hour.  I need to get from here to there.  I know the way, yet I can’t seem to get there.  I am a seeker and I am seeking light.

      I spent a few minutes the other night with a friend discussing our desire to observe lent.  We both thought about giving up something, but took some time throwing around ideas to no avail.  We thought of typical idea, such as giving up food items, all of which would be a valuable test of our fortitude.  In the end, we both decided to take a different route.  Instead of giving something up, we both decided to add something to our lives.  He chose to begin hand-writing letters to friends and mailing them, instead of keeping in touch with a few quick passing sentences via email.  I decided to write a blog message every day.  I began this project in November as a way to renew the practice of journaling in my life.  In years past, some of my greatest leaps in personal growth came through journaling.  I quickly began to neglect the project, with both good reasons and excuses.  Now, no more excuses.  So….Eric, when should I expect a letter?

      With the guidance of a good friend, I looked up the word passion as it is used in the Bible.  In some places, the Greek word epithymia (meaning desire) was used.  In other places, it uses the Greek word pyroo (meaning to burn).  Both of these definitions fit my image of the word we use today.  However, in two places in the new testament, the original Greek word is pathema, which means suffering.  Tonight I saw The Passion of the Christ, the highly touted movie that was the epithymia of Mel Gibson.  I tried to not think much about the movie before I saw it, after all, we have all been beguiled by the hype of a flick that did not stand up to reality (i.e. Pearl Harbor).  I decided I was going to be positive, but I would simply go see a movie that I hoped would have a deeper meaning that could be reflected in my faith.  Now that I have seen the movie, I believe the name is not only appropriate, but beautiful.    First, the movie is about suffering.  I’m not sure how others see the church as it is presented today, but I believe we teach a lot about God’s love, loving others, and doing the right thing.  This is good, Jesus was all about love.  I am certainly not suggesting that we should go back to the days (not that they are over) where pastors preached about hellfire and brimstone.  That was just a Christian outreach of Pharisee-like behavior management by good-intentioned clergy who didn’t know any better.  Perhaps it’s not even the church.  I hear all the time about how Jesus died for my sins, but it becomes mundane and meaningless after a while.  I know I have tried to give it more meaning in my mind, but now it has more meaning in my eyes and my heart.  Second, the movie is about desire.  Jesus had free will, just as we all do, to decide our own course.  He chose a path of peace that was plagued by violence, despair, torture, and death.  But he did this so that we all might have a chance to be part of that peace and paradise that was planned for us from the beginning.    I believe that I am becoming too philosophical and separated from myself as I continue to write, so I am going to bring this back down to where I really am and tell how I experienced the movie and then get into what I think about others watching the movie.  I’m sure all have heard by now that the movie is violent and intense.  It is.  But it seems to be historically accurate and a good reflection of what Christ experienced.  Please notice that I said this is a reflection.  Here is a good, yet frightening way to put this movie into perspective.  If you’re a sports fan, you’ve probably seen quite a few sporting events on TV.  Even though you may get a better view at home, sitting in front of the TV, it doesn’t compare to experiencing the event in person, live, at the stadium.  If you’ve ever played sports, you also know that the intensive goes up another hundred-fold if you are playing in the game.  Now imagine what you’ve just seen on the movie screen and imagine how much more intense it would have been to be there in person.  Then multiple that by 100 times and you still can’t imagine what it was like to be Jesus.  I didn’t really cry during the movie, but was nearly overcome with sadness on a few occasions throughout the movie.  I was most emotionally sympathetic at the suffering of the innocent man as he was beaten nearly to death.  I felt like I was dying inside at from witnessing the fear of a man who felt alone and abandoned by God as he hung dying from a cross.  Mostly, I was astonished by the Savior who explained that he continued to chose to go down this path again and again, every step of the way so that we might be saved.  I had three odd thoughts that came to mind while watching the movie. •	First, I kept thinking about how the lives on most people in the world went on that day without interruption or knowledge of the significance of what was happening.  I imagined parents playing with their children.  I imagined men getting up and preparing to go out and work in their fields.  I imagined businessmen working in the markets and wondering what the commotion was a couple blocks away as Jesus was passing by and struggling to carry his cross.  Imagine being Jesus and wondering if more than half a dozen people even cared that you were losing you life that day and you were doing it for them. •	Second, I wondered what it was like on those days between the crucifixion and the resurrection.  Were those days that the world existed without the intervention of God, and was simply in the hands of people and evil powers? •	Finally, at the time of the resurrection, which was very brief in the movie, I didn’t think of a triumphant Jesus or have any thought of jubilation.  I had more of a feeling of relief and starting over, which until right now, I didn’t realize was probably the right feeling to have.  My thoughts were of a business man who had just finished a job that had worn him out and taken all he had to give.  Then in the morning, he gets up, gets dressed, and heads out the door with a smile and a quite confidence that comes from knowing that the past is behind him and it’s time to begin a new day with a fresh start.  The last thing I want to discuss is who I believe will get the most out of this movie and why.  I believe the greatest value of this movie will be felt by people who already believe in Christ and want to grow in their faith.  I believe that this movie can be good for those who are interested, but may not be believers, but I believe that there is more value to seeing the movie for the first time as a believer.  It’s kind of like seeing the Wizard of Oz while you are a child.  There is a sense of wonder that you get as Dorothy goes on her journey throughout Oz.  As you get older, you start to see more details and nuances, but the best part is that you repeatedly experience that same wonder you had as a child.  With this movie, I think that you might learn quite a bit about Jesus and it may even prompt you to learn more, which would be good.  But I believe that as you grow as a Christian, you will start to see more in the movie, but you won’t feel the intensity that you get with a deeper understanding.  This doesn’t mean that I think non-Christians shouldn’t watch the movie, I just hope they can truly grasp it, not that I do.

      In the beginning There was the cold and the night Prophets and angels gave us the fire and the light Man was triumphant Armed with the faith and the will That even the darkest ages couldn't kill  Too many kingdoms Too many flags on the field So many battles,  so many wounds to be healed Time is relentless Only true love perseveres It's been a long time and now I'm with you After two thousand years  This is our moment Here at the crossroads of time We hope our children  carry our dreams down the line They are the vintage What kind of life will they live Is this a curse or a blessing that we give  Sometimes I wonder Why are we so blind to fate Without compassion,  there can be no end to hate No end to sorrow Caused by the same endless fears Why can't we learn from all we've been through After two thousand years  There will be miracles After the last war is won Science and poetry  rule in the new world to come Prophets and angels Gave us the power to see What an amazing future there will be  And in the evening After the fire and the light One thing is certain Nothing can hold back the night Time is relentless And as the past disappears We're on the verge of all things new We are two thousand years  Two Thousand Years is the ninth (9th) song on the River Of Dreams album and the fith (5th) song on disc 2 of 2000 Years: The Milennium Concert album. It is an original song by Billy Joel.

      I’ve been reading a book that I borrowed from a friend titled, Exploring Our Christian Faith (copyright 1978, Beacon Hill Press of Kansas City). I have been told that it is a standard book used in many classical theological circles because it covers the basics of Christian theology. There are many parts of the book that I find interesting and many parts that I take issue with. However, today I am focusing on the section that discusses evidence for the existence of God.  The first evidence cited by the authors is called the Cosmological Evidence. Basically, this theory states that the universe either has always existed, somehow started itself, or was created, and of these, the most reasonable choice is creation. The authors’ reason for coming to this conclusion is that all we know is started, or has some cause to bring it about. Therefore, the existence of the universe must have a cause. Since the universe was not pre-existent, it could not have brought about itself and it must have been created by God. The problem with this argument is that the author assumes that everything is brought about by a cause; however, doesn’t believe that God, himself would need a cause to exist, or need to be created. Sure, a basic understanding of the nature of God is that he is eternally existent. However, if we assume that God is eternally existent, it’s not too much of a stretch to accept that the universe may be. Just because you may choose to believe one and not the other does not make the argument valid or even reasonable. Now the authors’ view of creation does fit nicely with the scientific theory of the Big Bang, which most scientists subscribe to. Unfortunately, one could also argue that the scientists that developed the Big Bang Theory took scientific evidence and interpreted the information in a way that agrees with their pre-accepted beliefs of creation. There are also many other theories on how the universe works and an ever increasing body of evidence that contradicts the idea of the Big Band. One such theory, which I tend to believe, is that the universe simply has no known starting point. This may mean that it has always existed, or it could mean that we just don’t have evidence to indicate what might have been its beginning. The theory is that light is not just a wave of energy, but an actual energized particle. This also agrees with newer scientific evidence of light. Scientists do know that light is now a wave in the same fashion of a sound wave, but they continue to teach this theory because it does explain many of the characteristics of light, but, if true, would also contradict characteristics of light that we know to be true. The theory goes on to state that a star will emit these energized particles which will travel for many years until they run into something or expend their energy. This leaves the particles floating in space which will be gravitationally attracted to a more massive object or will float around until they run into other particles and will stick together due to their own gravitational fields. As these particles gather together, their collective gravitational field grows and they will begin attracting smaller particles and bringing them into their total mass. Eventually, these particles will become so massive and will have such a large gravitational pull that they will heat up to the point that they ignite a nuclear reaction and the particle becomes a star, which, in turn, emits particles and begins the process all over again. This process could go on forever. There are many other aspects of this theory that I could explain, such as Black Holes, etc. but I have already strayed away from that main point of this article. What this theory does not explain is how this all started. The original particles had to come into existence somehow. What I am trying to get as is that the existence of things, like planets, atoms, etc., does not make for a good argument of the existence of God. What I do believe to be a good argument is simply the existence of existence. Unfortunately, this still does not answer the paradox of the existence of God, but it makes for an interesting discussion.  The next set of evidence presented by the authors is called the Teleological Evidence. This suggests that the odds are too great that life would develop with our abilities and senses as tuned to our surroundings as to make life convenient. One example provided compares the likeliness of our existence to the following scenario: “If six monkeys were set to pounding typewriters, if only given enough time, they would eventually write all the books in the British Museum.” I, however, would suggest that the odds are actually made much better through natural selection, as proposed by Charles Darwin. Obviously, the senses that we develop that are useful to our existence would be a selective advantage. The better analogy would be that we set six monkeys to pounding keyboards. When one gets the first word right, he is rewarded. When he gets to consecutive words right, he is rewarded again, until all the books are written. This would certainly make the completion of these books more likely and make it happen much more quickly. Secondly, the odds are in our favor when you realize that there are billions of planets and billions of stars that have been around for billions of years. The analogy for this is using a billion rooms of six monkeys instead of just one. Finally, our senses are extremely helpful, but there may also be other ways to perceive that we have not developed. We know that there are animals that perceive things in ways that we do not. Also, it is relatively easy to understand that a person born blind cannot even imagine what sight is like. Just because the authors are not imaginative enough to think senses, does not mean they do nor exist or cannot be developed.  In the Ontological Evidence, two separate arguments are made, the first of which also contains a sub-argument. The first argument is, “God is that being than whom no greater can be conceived. But, a God existing in fact is greater than a God existing only in idea. Therefore, God must be thought of as existing in fact.” There are two problems with this argument. First, this assumes that God is that being. No evidence is provided or even suggested that would lead us to this assumption. Second, and probably more obvious, just because a mind can conceive of something does not mean it exists. What this argument is really stating is that if God exists at all, God must be a being and not just an idea. Unfortunately, the logical argument alone does not support or refute the existence of God. The sub-argument is that, “the idea of God is the only idea which, of necessity, permits the conception of nothing greater.” However, this, once again, would lead one to believe that if God exists and is the greatest conceivable concept, then God must be an actual being. But, of course, like the main argument, it really is circular. The argument really being made here is, “If God exists and is the greatest conceivable being, than God must exist as the greatest conceivable being. The second Ontological argument is, since all cultures throughout history believe in God, it must be an inherent necessity to believe in God. Since we naturally accept the existence of God, to reject this belief would be to reject all other human reason and perceptions through which our knowledge is gained. The problem with this argument is that, using the same reasoning as the author, one would conclude that the acceptance of this belief in God should lead to the acceptance of all other reasoning and common beliefs among cultures. In other words, the same ability to reason leads some people to believe in God and some to believe in no God. Therefore, we must accept the ability to reason that led to both conclusions. I’m sure the authors would not argue that Roman gods and Greek gods must exist because they were nearly identical beliefs from two cultures, nor would they agree with many cultures that worshiped the sun, or different animals, etc. Therefore, to accept the authors’ argument, we would have to accept the reasoning that coincides with their beliefs, but reject the reasoning that disagrees.  The next section is called Moral Evidence. This is the best argument provided by the authors. Although the authors do not analyze this concept in depth and make bad arguments, the basis is still a good argument. The premise is that all cultures have morals and certain morals are universal. Also, we judge certain moral standards to be more valuable than others. To do this, we must be basing our judgments on non-human standards. Since I have a strong sense of morality, and there are moral standards that we agree with that would be a disadvantage in natural selection, I agree with this statement. One apparent point of discussion might be that these moral standards that do not lead to a selective advantage would eventually lead people to extinction. However, moral people have outlasted and accomplished much more than many stronger people throughout history. Therefore, it is a very good argument.  The Scientific Evidence is a very interesting argument, I think it makes a very good point, but it’s not a point the authors were really trying to make. The argument made by the authors is that mathematics is a purely rational and purely intellectual pursuit of the human mind. Mathematics “correspond precisely to the intricate design of the natural order which predated man and his brain.” Therefore, the authors argue, the human brain must have been created in a way to correspond to these natural occurrences by the same being that created the universe. I think this is a bad argument for two reasons. First, mathematics is not, as the authors indicate, a purely intellectual and independently rational pursuit of the human mind. In fact, math was developed to explain or model the occurrences of nature. In other words, math developed from nature so it would make sense that math would do what it was developed to do, provide humans with a way to think about nature.. The most interesting point made is taken from another, named Vernon Sproxton, in a book titled, Diehlard de Chardin. He states, “The world is a cosmos not a chaos and that it has intelligible laws…” I believe this to be the main point made in arguing in favor of the existence of a creator. To have natural laws, the laws themselves must have come from somewhere. Even if you were to agree with my theory on the universe and its eternal cycles of change, you would notice two very important laws. First is gravity, second is fission. Without these two laws, nothing in the universe could exist. All particles would just float randomly. I believe this is a very good argument for the existence of God. That makes two good arguments.  The final form of evidence provided is called the Empirical Evidence. This is the best argument available. The authors explain it better and in much more detail than I will. Basically, it says I know there is a God because I know there is a God. This argument is based on one’s experience of God. If you have experience God working in your life than there should be no doubt in your mind of the existence of God. I personally know, beyond any doubt, that God exists because the effects he has had on my life. I believe that if someone does what I have done, which is sincerely look for truth not just look for evidence to support what I believed to be true, they will experience God too. My views on religion have changed drastically over the years. I even considered myself an atheist at one time. Thankfully, God knows one’s heart. I wasn’t claiming to be an atheist because I was rejecting God. After all, rejecting God is really a subconscious acceptance of the existence of God. To the contrary, I was simply looking for the truth of religion with an open mind. Keeping this open mind has been beneficial to me because it has allowed me to accept that fact that my life experiences were affected by God and that God must exist, must know my true inner self, and must be looking out for my best interests.  But, how can I convince you that I have experienced God.  You have to have the experience yourself to believe it.  So, when all boiled down, I believe that there are three reasons to believe in the existence of God: 1. The existence of existence. The fact that anything exists, including God. 2. The organization of matter and systems and the existence of natural laws. 3. The revelation of God in one’s life.  Son, I will begin to address the nature of Jesus and attempt to determine the rationality of the trinity.

      Yesterday morning, as part of a class, we discussed Romans 1:11-12.  The NIV reads, “I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong - that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.  When I read about John bringing the Romans a spiritual gift, I imagine it as being something mystical or supernatural, but it is so simple here.  His gift to make the Romans strong is the gift of encouragement that come from associating with those who share your faith.  Never before have I considered that my faith would be a spiritual gift to others by encouraging them.  Perhaps even more important, I never imagined that my own lack of faith could have a detrimental effect on others by discouraging them.

      One of my first questions I asked myself when I began investigating Christianity was…. Why doesn’t God make the truth so obvious that it is impossible for anyone to doubt it.  For example, every time someone does something sinful, they should get sick, or have their car breakdown, or have an emergency that requires them to spend money that they don’t have.  Then, every time people are good, faithful, etc., only good things will happen to them.  They would be happy, healthy, wealthy, and wise.  The reality that we all know is that sometimes good things happen to bad people and sometimes bad things happen to good people.  Why?  I know this seems like a juvenile question to ask, especially to those who consider themselves to be learned in religion or mature in their faith.  But for me, I’m still not sure that I get it, and here’s why.  Even before I became a Christian, I noticed what seemed to be an interesting paradox.  It seems to me that the Christians I know experienced more personal health problems and more personal tragedy that anyone I had known before.  Just because that is what I have noticed, doesn’t make it a fact.  After all, to get a true understanding of these happenings, we would have to do a national survey comparing Christians to non-Christians and, as far as I know, nobody has done that.  What I do know is that in the last year, several Christian friends have been diagnosed with cancer.  Some have been in accidents.  Some have lost close friends and relatives.  One lady in the last year lost her grandmother, her mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, her grandson was born with a heart defect and had to have surgery only a few days old, one daughter divorced and soon after had surgery on her abdomen, but the wound wouldn’t heal so she stayed with her mother (the lady I know) for several weeks to heal.  Later that same daughter was in a car accident.  Finally this lady was diagnosed with stage 4 Breast Cancer and her husband was diagnosed with a heart problem.  I personally have never had any serious medical problems in my life until I became a Christian.  Since that time, I have developed at least two allergies (one to a common medication), have had kidney problems, had a dislocated shoulder, developed gout, discovered that I may have an irregular heartbeat, and my parents and grandparents have had serious illnesses and hospitalizations.    I guess what I am asking is….  Is God giving us all an obvious hint that we are going the wrong direction?  Are we trying so hard to be faithful that we’re missing the clues God is giving us to tell us our beliefs are wrong?  I have always understood that struggle is needed in my life for me to be able to grow into the best person I can be. I do have an internal drive to be the best, but overcoming obstacles makes me much stronger than I could have ever become with just my own determination.  I have always believed that this is God’s way of pruning us.  This is how God molds us into the people we should be.  I also believe that practically nothing that comes easy is worth having and becoming the person God wants me to be is definitely a worthwhile venture.  But when do the Christians get a break?  One of the reasons I struggle with this really has little to do with my ailments or those of my friends.  I struggle because I still believe in God and Jesus and Christianity in spite of all of this and I feel like a damn fool for doing so.  Perhaps what I really need is a bigger perspective.  Perhaps Christians are not more ill or tragedy stricken than others, I’m just noticing it more.  Perhaps Christians are more tragedy stricken, but not because they are targeted by God, but because they bring it on themselves.  Hmmmmm.  I’ll have to think about that and write about it again in a few days.

      Today’s message is much more personal.  I am still writing about politics, which is a passion of mine, but today I choose to write about something closer to my heart.  Some friends that I dearly love are moving away.  Not far, but farther.  Right now, I get to see them twice a week, soon it will be likely once a month or less.  We have always gotten together as part of a group of friends all with the same destination, but on different paths.  We have always decided to have a “loose grip” on the group.  People can come and go as they please.  They are always welcome.  Now I still have a “loose grip” but I want to hold on tight.    I have a deep love for everyone that comes to visit and a greater love for those that come to stay.  Since we began getting together, many of those I love have moved on: Ryan, Doug, Tammi, and now Eric and Kerri.  Those that remain, I love as much as I have ever loved anyone and those that leave should know that are loved and will be missed.  I feel like I am being called, by God and by friends, to take the lead in coordinating the ongoing group events, but I feel like a fraud and unworthy of the job.  I try to be faithful and I try to be fruitful, but I doubt too much.  I don’t doubt that God will be there for me, that would be a blessing.  Some days, I doubt the existence of God. I pray for faith, I pray for guidance, I pray that God will make me the man that He wants me to be.  But I’m not.  I’m weak, I faithless, and I’m certainly now who I should be.  I don’t know what will happen to the friendship between those of us that remain, but God has gotten us to where we are and God will continue to take us to where we need to be.

      From reading the previous entry, you can probably tell that I am dissatisfied with the current state of politics in America.  But, I really didn’t give you any clues as to my political leanings.  Don’t worry, I really have equal disdain (and some agreement) for all political parties and most national candidates.  It’s hard not to think about politics these days, especially for a political hack like myself.  With the presidential election on November 2, we can look forward to seven months of political positioning (i.e. mud slinging, spin, half-truths, etc.).  With all this underhanded game playing, how do we select one of these people to run our government and make decisions that may seriously affect our future and the world?    First, we should not be too concerned with the rhetoric.  Politics are not worse today than they were in the past.  In fact, a close look at political articles published in the late 1700’s may even lead us to believe that we are much more civil these days.  This doesn’t make the lies acceptable, but it doesn’t mean the world has gotten worse either.  Also, studies show that the primary effect of negative advertising is the suppression of voter turnout.  So, the best thing to do in this case is to go out and vote on election day.  Your candidate may not win, but the goal of the negative candidates will be foiled.  In addition, how can we have a country governed by the consent of the governed if the citizens leave the decisions to others who do vote?  We can argue about the role of government, the responsibility of the individual, and even the real effectiveness of government.  However, for me it really comes down to the debate over personal liberty.  I believe personal liberty is and should be the highest value of people when considering the role of government.  Many of my Christian friends will likely disagree with me on this, but my primary reason is based on my faith.  Another reason, nearly as important, is the basic practicality of the benefits of personal liberty on the community as a whole.  Why is liberty important for a Christian?  First, personal liberty is not required to fulfill one’s role as a Christian, but it is desirable.  Throughout the New and the Old Testaments there are many references to people in slavery and in prison, but that did not prevent them from doing God’s will.  In fact, it was generally the will of God that was expressed through their lack of freedom.  However, God’s grace was shown to them through the granting of freedom.    Second, freedom is a theme seen throughout the Old and New Testament.  In the Old Testament, it is usually mentioned in relation to granting or fighting for freedom of slaves.  However, the story of Adam and Eve is a great example of freedom and its role in the eyes of God.  I will come back to that later.  The New Testament more directly addresses freedom and gives warnings to the use of freedom.  In fact, to know Christ is often referred to as having freedom in Him.  The following verses are important and I will refer to some of them later:  Goodness of Freedom I Corinthians 7:21 – “Were you a slave when God called you?  Don’t let it trouble you – although if you can gain your freedom, do so.” I Corinthians 7:23 – “You were bought at a price; do not become slaves to men.”   II Corinthians 3:17 – “Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.” James 1:25 – “But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it – he will be blessed in what he does.”  Warning about freedom I Corinthians 8:9 – “Be careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak.” Galatians 5:13 – “You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love.” I Peter 2:16 – “Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God.”  These are not all of the verses about freedom.  Some others are irrelevant to this conversation and others will be brought up later.  From the beginning, God gave us free will.  Adam and Even in the Garden of Eden were free to choose to obey God or to eat the forbidden fruit.  Many theologians hypothesize that it was always the intent of God that man would eat the fruit.  Regardless, this sin has put mankind in the bondage of sin.  In fact, I might even argue that mankind was in bondage prior to the “original sin” and the “fall” was God’s will to allow us to reach true freedom.  You may not agree, but keep reading.  it is through Christ that man can become completely free.  In spite of this, we have always been given the opportunity to choose.  God has endowed us with free will.  We can choose God, or we can choose evil.  We can choose to believe or we can refuse to believe.  Regardless of our choice, it is God’s plan that we have the freedom do decide for ourselves.  Romans 8:20-21 reads, “For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.”  Now, let’s look at what government is.  First, Government is the only legitimate use of force on earth.  Ultimately, God has all the power, but on earth, governments are endowed as the ultimate arbiter of power.  Anything that government does is done through force or the threat of force.  Is this bad? Yes!  Is it necessary? Yes!  That is why some people refer to government as a necessary evil.  Obviously, we need government.  We need a police force to enforce laws prohibiting crimes, such as murder and rape.  We also need government to serve as an independent arbitrator to resolve disputes between two parties.  That’s what civil courts are about.  We also, need government to form a military to protect and defend the citizens of the country.  These are pretty basic purposes of government and almost everyone would agree with me on this.    But what is the role of government beyond this?  Does government have a role beyond the basic perseverance of rights?  I say no!  Personal liberty is akin to freedom of conscience.  Not only do I believe that God wants us to have the freedom to make our own decisions, I believe we need these freedoms to fully live as Christians.  But should government be involved in the providing for those who cannot provide for themselves?  Again, I say no!  When we depend on government to do things for us, we become weak.  For example, when government gets involved in charity, we get lazy and depend on government to fill a role that we as Christians should fill.  The bible tells us that we are our brothers’ keepers, but we should not pawn that responsibility off on others, even if we are paying for it through taxes.  My biggest fear is that people will miss the grace of God because we are substituting God’s grace for our own.  We are showing people that they do not need to depend on God, they can depend on us and our government.  It is only through the freedom that we are forced to seek God and not to depend on government, a false idol.  I am really cutting this short now because this has taken too long and few will read it anyway.  I will address the practical needs for more personal freedom in the next few days and may address specific issues.  For now, I will end with this verse:  Galatians 5:1 – “It is for freedom that Christ has set us free.  Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by the yolk of slavery.”

      When I started this "blog" I titled this "the journey of a seeker."  Tomorrow I begin the next big step on this journey.  I will be leaving early in the morning for a spiritual retreat.  I will be camping in the woods of Missouri.  I will be bringing books, paper, and pens.  I will also be meeting with Fr. Paul Jones, a Trappist Monk, for some guidance before I begin.  When I originally had the idea of taking this retreat, I was driven with a passion to get this planned. Immediately after I made the arrangements, my interest nearly disappeared.  In the last week, the drive and passion has returned.  I am very excited and know this is God's plan for me.  I have several goals I want to achieve. First, I want to get away from everything that is currently my life and relax. I need to be able to forget my job, my bills, and all other stressors so I can begin to discover what really matters. Second, I need a better understanding of who Jesus is/was. Third, when I have a better understanding of Jesus, I need to determine what that means in regard to individuality and community.  I also need to understand what individuality and community mean to society in general. Fourth, and most important to me, I really need to know where God wants me to go from here. Who am I?  What is my role in the near and distant future?  I'm still seeking.  I still need guidance.  I still need God, now more than ever.

      Today I had lunch with a great man, a brilliant man who I have considered a mentor. For the most part, we hold similar political views.  We do not hold similar religious views. He sees everything in light of individualism vs. collectivism (individualism=good and collectivism-bad). Collectivism sounds good and makes you feel good when you think about it, while individualism sounds selfish.  Reality seems to prove that individualism is good and progressive while collectivism is regressive and bad.  Everywhere individualism is considered a virtue, society prospers, individuals prosper, and even the poorest of the poor have a better standard of living than the average person in a society where individualism is considered a detriment. What are other factors are important in considereing that value of an idelology or determining what is a virtue?  How does this reflect on Christianity?  What does this mean when we talk about community?  Can these two views co-exist harmoniously?  If so, how?  If not, then what?

      I had an interesting realization today. even though I'm horribly faithless, I'm just as faithful as some of the most faithful people I know.  We all count too much on ourselves to control the world and our circumstances.  I need to just let go and have some fun.  It's time to let all those who think they're in control face their own futility. And for those of us who can now submit to the will of God, perhaps we'll just ride the wave.

      Tonight held a great gathering of many of my friends.  This may be the first night that I can remember all of us having a prayer request.  With all the help we need, God must be very powerful.  Otherwise we would all just fall apart.  We are strengthened by Him and each other.  We hold each other up and lift each other up.  God has blessed us all, especially me.  Thank You!

      Two days ago, I was on top of the world.  Today, I'm not sure how to make my life work.  I've been pursueing a higher education, but have committed to a close know community of friends.  I'm not sure how both will work together, unless we can reschedule.  I often hear stories of people who turn to God when there life is bad, when they have no where else to turn, but forget about God when life is good.  I do more of the opposite, when life is good, I am thankful.  When life is not so good, I tend to think God is not present and I work to control things myself.  I'm letting go.

      We all need to grow to survive. Our Sunday night group may need to grow or go away.  Right now it is just three of us. We are sincere in what we do, but we need more people to take part. Tonight, one of us couldn't be there so we cancelled it. I will be unavailable next week and possibly the week after. How can we grow? How can we stabilize? How can I stay a part of it as my time becomes more restricted? God will provide.

      Today has been a great day and God has blessed me deeply.  I spent some time with  Christy, whom I will miss dearly when she moves to California.  Perhaps she'll never know how I really feel, but perhaps she will.  I spent the afternoon with good friends.  How could I be so blessed.  I often feel sorry for myself and the circumstances of my life.  What a fool I have been.  God, thank you for the life you have given me and all the blessings that have been showered upon me.

      As I have previously mentioned, school is keeping me busy.  The problem is that there are many other things that I have started that I don't want to put off for 2.5 years, like the rewriting of my paper on Community.  My final paper anaylzing the nature of Christ as related to thhe Trinity, etc.  Of course, I want time to my self to just relax on occasion too.  I think the best part of my education so far is my realization of how much time I wasted before, but that's not all bad.  So does anyone read this, or am I just blogging to myself?  There's no need for me to just entertain myself before I go to bed so I may stop writing here.

      Today was my first day of school since December 1996 (7.5 years).  I started off with Financial Accounting and followed with Business Statistics.  I'm a little concerned about the Accounting, but most people who know me understand that I'm going to enjoy stats.  I'm not feeling as overwhelmed as I was a couple of days ago, but I still see that this will take up a great deal of my time and I need to get used to it.    I've been trying this online dating this too, but I just don't think anything is going to come of it.  Perhaps at 34 I should just accept that I missed my best opportunities.

      I'm trying to be prepared and get a little ahead on my school work.  I decided that I am going to get everything done for the week before the end of the day on Sunday.  This way I won't have to worry about scrambling to get things done throughout the week.  I got my first syllabus on Friday morning via email.  I began reading and doing my homework for the first week.  I received the other syllabus Sunday morning.  I worked for about 11 hours this weekend and I'm just now done with what I need to do for the first class.  Now I have to read two chapters and do homework for the second class.  I've really been stressed about classes for a couple of weeks and now that I'm started, I am already beginning to remember why I liked school.  I am at my best when I am pushed to be my best.  I get so lazy when I have no reason to push myself.  When I get myself into situations where I have to push myself, I excel.  It is now 12:08 am on Sunday night (Monday morning) and I still need to read at least 25 pages tonight.  I am excited right now and ready to go.  I'm guessing that I won't be as excited in the morning.

      Tonight I had orientation for school.  I am excited about the idea of returning but I never imagined I would have as many reservations.  School starts next Tuesday.  From then it will be at least two years of work with very little social life.  I already feel like I'm getting in over my head.  I don't know how I can expect to start dating or ever get marrtied if I do this.  Perhaps some psychologist will read this and tell me that I am intentionally limiting my availability as an excuse for my fear of not ever being in a relationship.  Perhaps they would be right.  I guess one good thing is that there are now new peole in my life and that is never a bad thing.  I'm already looking forward to the day that I am done.  Pray for me, I'm going to need it.

We have decided that we will be getting together on Mondays and Wednesdays on alternating weeks.  This should be pretty easy to keep track of as long as we all check the new blog.  By the way, the blog is coming together.  urlLink http://2or3.blogspot.com

      Well, I'm back in town from my hiatus to the wood of Missouri.  It was a great week.  On Tuesday and Wednesday I was a little stir crazy.  I've not been secluded for such a long period.  By Thursday I was settling in, just as I has expected, but for different reasons.  The silence was wonderful, it was the lack of things to keep me busy that drove me crazy.  This was a great way to force me too focus on what I was supposed to focus on, God.  I read most of three books, hiked throughout the area, wrote more than 20 pages of journals, and wrote a 30 page assessment of the concept of community. This assessment includes 41 points of concern of the typical views of community and my thoughts of what must happen for tru community to succeed.  I also took more than 100 pictures and am trying to put together a photo album of the trip, but I'm out of ink and photo paper.  I'll get it done.  Now I need to start typing and get this assessment of community into the computer so I can send it out to friends for critiquing.

       Where is the dividing line between arrogance and self-confidence?&nbsp; It seems to me whenever I am self-confident, I feel like I'm being arrogant.&nbsp; I try to be reasonable (logical) about all of my decisions, about all of my beliefs, about all of my opinions.&nbsp; Often, I end up the only one who believes what I do.&nbsp; I know of few people who agree with me politically, practically no one who agrees with me theologically, and absolutely no one who agrees with me on both.&nbsp; As a result, my first inclination is to assume that my views are wrong, but I just need to figure out why/how.&nbsp; After a while, and many, many, discussions/debates, I still can't figure out how I'm wrong, nor has anyone else shown me.&nbsp; People tell me I'm wrong, but it seems that most have not really thought through or studied the issues.&nbsp; Now I'm beginning to believe that I just might be right.&nbsp; As a result, I feel like I'm being arrogant for even thinking that.&nbsp; I know that even if I am right, it is of no credit to me.&nbsp; I didn't make the world the way it is, nor am I the arbiter of "truth" in any sense of the word.&nbsp; I'm simply recognizing it... or am I?

       Alyssa had her doctor's appointment on Monday and we are supposed to know the results of this "hot-spot" test in a few days.&nbsp; She had heart tests on Tuesday, and had her port implanted in Wednesday.&nbsp; Thankfully she had a break from the medical tasks/tests today.&nbsp; Of course she used this break to clean her apartment.&nbsp; She will go into work tomorrow and on Monday she has a bone scan.&nbsp; I understand these are all typical of breast cancer cases.&nbsp; I imagine she's already tired of the grind, but this is just the beginning.&nbsp; fortunately, the older we get the quicker these things seem to go by.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess she'll be back to a normal life before we know it.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   It seems like school just started, but I'm already more than half way through my first two classes.&nbsp; It seems quick in two ways.&nbsp; First, because time goes by fast, especially when you're very busy.&nbsp; Second, because I'm having a hard time keeping up with the information.&nbsp; The subject matter isn't too difficult, but I don't have enough time for it all to sink in before we move on.&nbsp; Now, I'm having to go back to previous chapters to reread items I knew a couple of weeks ago, but already forgot.&nbsp; Perhaps it's not the class, but me.&nbsp; Are these early signs of getting older?&nbsp; Oh well, I'll just keep plugging away.&nbsp; Soon, I'll be graduating and we'll have almost forgotten that my sister was even sick.... thankfully.

       I had something interesting come up on Sunday at Bible study.&nbsp; I attend a Sunday morning bible study that is taught by Marv, a good man and the father of a friend.&nbsp; I like Marv and have a lot of respect for him and his family.&nbsp; It was decided by the group that we will take the month of August off and restart the bible study in September.&nbsp; While discussing this, Marv suggested that I teach a few weeks in September while he is out of town.&nbsp; I was also told on Monday night that Marv was considering asking me to co-teach the class with him (although he did not ask me to do that) ....   Now I'm don't know what to do.&nbsp; I'm inclined to refuse for several reasons.&nbsp;   First, I'm not even a member of the church.&nbsp; I have not become a member because what I believe differs from that of the church on some fundamental theological issues.&nbsp; Although I don't believe that my differing beliefs are material to belief in Christianity, some of the pastoral staff (and probably most Christians) do.&nbsp; I certainly do not want to try to hide or disguise my beliefs, but this could cause a problem if this discussion were to come up in class.&nbsp; In addition, I'm not so sure Marv would want me to teach if he knew my views.   Second, I think I might have been asked because I am a guy.&nbsp; Previously, this class was co-taught by Marv and Mike (another good man and father of another friend).&nbsp; It seems to me there are many others in the class that are better qualified to teach than&nbsp; am.&nbsp; This list includes, Lynn, Alison, Sharon, Jeanne, etc.&nbsp; Why did he ask me instead of one of them?   Third, I'm flattered by the idea that he might consider me worthy of teaching this class with him.&nbsp; This makes me want to reject it outright.&nbsp; I certainly don't want to teach so that it massages my own ego.&nbsp; That won't do anyone any good, including me.&nbsp;   For these reasons, I want to run away from this idea.&nbsp; But should I still consider this?&nbsp; There are reasons that I should.   First, (I like numbered lists) I respect Marv and I respect his judgment.&nbsp; This could be a calling that I want to reject, but I should accept.&nbsp; In the bible it seems like it's standard procedure to want to refuse God's calling out of fear or other reasons.&nbsp; One of my first thoughts was that if this doesn't seem like something I am drawn to, I should accept that it is not a calling.&nbsp; However, I do feel drawn to it, but I fear it is for the wrong reasons.&nbsp; I want to have the respect of others in the church.&nbsp; I want to believe that I have the knowledge to do this job and do it well.&nbsp; I want to believe that God is calling me to teach in the church, in spite of (or perhaps because of) my differing views.&nbsp; But these are all self-serving desires on my part.&nbsp; But is that relevant?&nbsp; What is God is calling me to do this?&nbsp; How do I know?   Second, I love to teach and I miss doing it.&nbsp; One of the best aspects of teaching is how much you learn in the process.&nbsp; I know I could learn a lot in the process.&nbsp; I've not focused on the bible much since I&nbsp; started back to school.&nbsp; This would force me to focus on it more.&nbsp; I'm sure I would learn a great deal and it would make me a better person in the end.   I need to pray about this.&nbsp; I also need to call Marv and talk to him about it.&nbsp; I don't want to go into this with any misunderstanding or misrepresentation.&nbsp; I believe I should refuse to help teach, even for just a couple of weeks, but I don't want to refuse if this really is God's will.   So, is this an opportunity that God has laid before me? Is this simply a challenge for me to take on to become a better person? Is this a reponsibility of mine that I should live up to?&nbsp; Is this a test to see if I make the right decision or is it a test to see if I'm willing to submit to the will of God?  What do you think?&nbsp; Any words of advise/wisdom would be appreciated.&nbsp;

       It seems most of my blogs are updates on my sister, but that's what is occupying my mind these days.&nbsp; My sister and mom left Thursday at 7:00 PM for San Diego and got back home on Monday morning at 7:00 AM.&nbsp; That's 84 hours of driving with only stops for food, gas, and occasionally just to stretch out.&nbsp; Then Alyssa had a doctor's appointment at 9:30 AM.&nbsp; She got out of the doctor's office at 1:30, drove to Newark and back so she could return the rental car.&nbsp; She finally left my apartment at 4:30 PM.&nbsp; She was back at the hospital today for X-rays and tests.&nbsp; Tomorrow, she will have a port surgically implanted to make chemo-therapy easier.&nbsp; Chemo-therapy may start as soon as this Friday.     &nbsp;   The test she had on Monday was to locate "hot spots" in her body.&nbsp; This should let us know if there are any other potential places that the cancer has spread.&nbsp; Obviously, this is really important, so please pray for a negative (or should I say positive) result.     &nbsp;   The best news is that my mom and sister made it home safely with my niece.&nbsp; The next best news is that my dad survived a few days of being taken care of by me and primarily by my brother Daniel.     &nbsp;   I also heard yesterday that Harvey Mast is going back into the hospital for tests because spots have been found on his lung and stomach.&nbsp; If anyone has any news on this, I would love to know any details.

       I just made it back home today from a business trip to Breckenridge, Colorado.&nbsp; It was a busy trip and I didn't get much studying done.&nbsp; I got back home at 11:00 p.m. last night and I had a Statistics exam this morning at 9:30 a.m.&nbsp; Then I arranged for a rental car for my sister, drove to Newark to pick up my mom, and waited until 5:30&nbsp;when my sister came to my apartment.&nbsp; I took them to get the rental car and then I went&nbsp;to class.&nbsp; It's now 10:45 p.m. and I just got home.&nbsp; I will try to recoup tomorrow.&nbsp; My mom and sister are off to California to pick up my niece from her father's house.&nbsp; At 10:00 they were coming into Indianapolis.&nbsp; It's going to be a long few days for them.&nbsp; They hope to get to San Diego and return by Sunday night.

      Michael Moore has been in the news quite a bit lately due to the release of his latest political propaganda,  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  I am concerned that so many good people believe the lies and misrepresented circumstances portrayed in his films, including friends of mine.  I know Moore presents his films as fact, but they are more representative of the propaganda films of World War I than they are any serious documentary.  As a registered and formerly politically active Dem., what concerns me the most is the Democratic Party's embrace of this man.  It does not take much research to discover the misdirection and outright lies Moore proposes as fact.  But the Democrats are embracing Moore because he brings people to their side and gets people to vote for them.  Isn't it better to get people to vote for you because they agree with your policies, your philosophy, your vision for America, and your candidate's competence rather than to dupe them into supporting you?  Most people are relatively rational and make strategic decisions in the political world rationally.  We can only assume one of two things here: Either the party is turning a blind eye to Michael Moore or they actually stand for this type of methodology themselves (as did Mussolini). Either the Democratic leaders are morally bankrupt because they are willing to sell their collective soul (figuratively speaking) for political support, or they are morally bankrupt because what the party stands for is simply getting control through manipulation of the masses.  The Republican's aren't perfect either and I certainly dislike their representation of themselves as being on the side of God.  There’s no litmus test to join either party.  You can join one and vote completely with the other.  I want to say that it's about time the parties and their leaders begin to stand for something, but they do.  They don't tell us what they stand for, they show us.  I know what I'm seeing, what are you seeing?  For more information on Michael Moore and his films,  urlLink check out this blog entry .  This was written by Dr. David Mayer, a friend of mine and professor at Capital University Law School.

      Today was another full day.  I think I am starting to get used to it.  I woke up at 7:15 AM.  Get ready and went to work.  I worked hard all day.  This time of year tends to be very busy for me.  I ate lunch at the office because there was no time to go out.  I grabbed food at McD's on the way to school at 5:00 PM.  I ate while I drove and got to class by 5:45, which gave me 15 minutes to review before class started.  I had Accounting from 6:00 - 7:50 PM, followed by a "town meeting" for all part-time MBA students, followed by Statistics until 9:50 PM.  I got home at 10:15 PM and hopped on the web to check email and read the blogs of friends.  This is a typical schedule for me for Tuesdays and Thursdays.  I've already gotten to the point where I question my judgment about starting back to school.  I love school, but I wish I could go and not work.  I guess all of us in the program would probably like that.  At work we had a staff meeting.  The board of directors voted to give the staff a bonus.  It was very generous.  I think I will use mine to help my sister buy a wig.  She will probably want one while going through Chemo-Therapy.  The rest is going to debt relief.  I'm still paying for the first round of schooling, this will help.

      These last few days I have been more thankful than I can remember ever being.  My sister had her right breast removed.  Her cancer appeared out of no where, as cancers do, and spread so fast that even the doctors were caught by surprise.  Dr. Juan must be blessed.  My sister had her operation on Friday and went home today.  She’s a little sore, but mostly back to normal.  I’ve also never had more admiration for my sister.  When faced with her own mortality, she approached the problem with a smile and determination.  Her spirit is the only thing than kept me from breaking down.  She still plans her long driving vacation next week and the doctor says she should be fine.  This isn’t over, when she returns, the chemo-therapy begins.  I’m sure there are easier ways for God to show me his blessings.  I’ll try to pay closer attention.

      It seems self-indulgent to blog when no one reads it.  It has been nearly two weeks since I asked that question.  I guess I'll give it a rest.

      It all seems so strange. I spoke with my brother today to make sure he was up-to-date on our sister. We discussed her cancer, her attitude, and our hope for her. Yet, it seems so strange. The conversations are so clinical. We are all very "matter of fact" about everything. How can we be otherwise? I think the only other option is to just scream at the top of my lungs, but I fear that if I do, I may not stop. Oddly, the only thing that cheers me up is talking to my sister.  I can't seem to pull myself out of this funk. Since becoming a Christian, my life has been in a continuous plummet. My grandparents have gotten sick, my dad has gotten sick, my friends have gotten sick, and now my sister. If you know me, it might be better for you to stay away. I would gladly die right now to save any one of these people. Perhaps Jesus was the lucky one. He actually was able to die to save his loved ones.  I can't even remember the last time I had any real joy in my life. I think that's one reason I love playing with Riley, Trey, and McKenna. I love these kids, but they also serve as temporary anesthetic. Someone told me once that this is a sign that Satan is trying to trick me into turning from God to win my soul. Trust me, my soul's not worth all that effort. Then when I wallow long enough in my own self pity, I remember that I should have nothing to complain about. After all, I’m not fighting just to stay alive. I am probably the most self-centered person I know. Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!  That’s a nice substitute for a scream.

      I spoke with my sister tonight on the phone.  I called her at 9:45 and we talked until about 11:15.  It was a good conversation.  I'm amazed by her persistent faith and positive attitude.  They are going to try Chemo-therapy for two months and redo all the tests she just had to see if it's doing any good.  One of the blessing about a situation like this is that the love of family and friends comes pouring out.  It's too bad we need a scare to remind us of how much we mean to each other.   Her doctor told her that he can't do anything for her and that she is in God's hands now.  That's a good place to be.

       OK let's start with my sister.  Alyssa heard back early from her doctor about her tests. She still has cancer. Her lymph nodes in her shoulder tested positive, so did her liver. She also has cancer in two of her ribs (one on each side). The doctor says it's incurable. I guess it's not all bad. She had her first Chemo-therapy treatment today. The doctor wants to wait for two months and see how she is responding to the treatments. If the tumors seem smaller, she may be able to complete her treatments and just take a couple of pills every day for the rest of her life. That's the best case scenario. I'm sure you can imagine that it's not good if the cancer continues to grow or spread.   Now, Harvey Mast.   I spoke with Harvey on Monday and he confirmed that he has cancer again. He has two spots of cancer. One on his stomach and the other next to his lung. It's also in his bones. This doesn't sound good. Harvey seemed to be in good spirits. He said that this cancer won't respond to chemo-therapy. The plans right now are to get radiation treatments and hope for the best. We'll know more information next week.    Don't forget Dorie.   Tomorrow morning, Dorie has her first appointment since she finished all of her treatments. All seems well for Dorie right now.        Please pray for all of them.

       Today is the first day in more than a week that I feel like I'm getting back to normal. I go through phases of being full of energy and being not so energetic. I don't remember being this way when I was younger, just in the last couple of years. I think it's all about my sleep schedule. For about 10 days I have been sleepy all the time, but not sleeping much at night. As a result, I have begun to fall behind on school work. Yesterday and today I was supposed to study all day. On both days I took a nap. Today's was about two hours. The good news is that since I woke up today, I have felt more energetic and I've gotten some studying and some cleaning done. I guess we all go through these down times. This one was just particularly bad. Tomorrow night I will get to have church with some good friends and eat low-carb lasagna. I'll have to let you know if the lasagna cheers me up more or drags me into the depths of despair.
