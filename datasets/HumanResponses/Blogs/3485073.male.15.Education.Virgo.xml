      School is always an interesting experience, today was no exception. We got to paint again in religion class today (I feel like i'm back in kindergarten), and Mr. O'Brien (the religion teacher) is still blaming me for the VCR that he broke. It was actually kind of funny how he broke it, he tried to pull the T.V. cart over to watch the movie and accidentally tipped it and sent the VCR crashing to the floor, breaking the faceplate on it. And auto shop was a blast today too. Rodney brought in this push go-cart for his I.S. and, of course, Jason and I took it for a test drive. Man! that thing is awsome! It's got two wheels in the front and one in the back that steers. We pushed it full tilt across the parking lot and man does that thing ever corner sharp! You turn the wheel just a bit and you bring it up on to two wheels! Math class was a blast too. Of course, it always is (I won't go into detail about that). But the highlight of the day was definitley civics class. We had a sub today, so we played tic, tac, toe and SOS all class. Amanda raped us both at it. then she started to write things on my arm. Man, she broke up with her man on thursday, i'm thinking about making a move on her...  WILL COLTON EVER ASK AMANDA OUT? WILL RODNEY EVER LET THEM USE HIS GO-CART AGAIN? TUNE IN NEXT TIME AND SEE!

      It was crazy, today we (me, mike wheeler, and travis ferguson) went nuts today with travis' car! First, a descrption of his car. He drives an old, beat-up buik skylark that he's preping to run n the enduro race. It has only one seat (others ripped out for racing)it's very loud, and has no windows. the three of us rode around in the field with Mike stuffed in the trunk, then we started running into stuff (with mike still in the trunk. then Mike and i rode on the roof and hanging out the window while driving down the road. that was fun. then we chased Mike around with the car while he threw stuff at us. Then i tried driving standard for the first time, i stalled it once, then i got the hang of it. ha, ha, good times, good times...

      I've had a shitty week so far. Kev,I have nothing to say to you here, read the e-mail. (That can give the rest of you guys a hint that something happened). But I'm not gonna dwell on that incident. I went to kev's the other day, tried Battle Engine Aquila, pretty good game, I just don't share the same enthusiasm as Kev on the game (view Kevin's blog for more info). We slept up in his "barn" and froze our asses off. The next morning, we were mucha bored until his dad came and picked us up. Then kev drove me home (Yes, you heard right). I feel really guilty for taking those disks now, and i don't know why I feel so incredibly crappy about it. Cuz i plan to give them back. Then the next day I did literally nothing all frigging day. But on the bright side, we have a dog now! Rusty's the name, being a dog's his game (Yeah, I haven't slept in a while, so what?). I'm hoping to hook up with Mikaela sometime this week before she leaves. (Man, if only she wasn't moving...) But we should have a good time, maybe invite some other people to come along, just so it doesn't seem like more than a get-together (If you know what I mean,) after all, she does have a boyfriend, and I don't wanna intrude on that. I've got more respect than that. If you read this Mik, i hope you'll never forget us all, read my blog, I'll keep updates on local happenings. And i hope you can get lucky and find a guy like Andre or me down in the springs. (Yeah, this was a boring post, so what? you wanna make something of it punk? eh?)

      Hey guys, sorry I didn't post yesterday, I didn't have the time to. So I'm summing up the past two day's events with one post. First, Kev, why the F*CK didn't you invite me over when Kenan was over? I haven't seen Kill Bill either! I'll talk to you about that later (ass wipe). But Friday was great! I mean, trav, tony and I all went out for a ride. We got mega muddy. I had to pull down a tree with my winch (again) and Travis got me super muddy riding behind him (thank god for windshields). Going down one trail, I got hung up between two trees, It took us a while to get me out. But my four wheeler never gets stuck in mud (four wheel drive baby!). Then, on Saturday, we went to a friends house (a f*ckin' nice one at that). Brad and I hung out, watched the football game, watched most of 8 mile (I still havent seen that movie) then we watched Saving Private Ryan. That's a long movie! it's like four and a half hours long. But some other stuff (if ya know what I mean) was cumming, oops, I mean coming on at 1:50am. But Brad fell asleep on the couch, TL fell asleep right in the chair in front of the computer (hands on the keyboard and all). I was bored so I just turned off the T.V. and the lights, and crashed on the other ouch in the room (the smaller one that I don't even fit on). That's what hapenned. So till tomorrow, peace out.

      Whew! Today was very tiring. I've been condemned to clear the bush behing our house. Thats no easy task! Man was I ever tired. Hey, if any of my friends read this tonight, are you doing anything tomorrow, 'cuz I'm probably gonna be in Cornwall tomorrow. Sorry nothing interesting happened today, maybe something will happen tomorrow. (ZZZZZZZZZZ)

      WHA! That was a crazy party. Mark and Kevin S were piss drunk from that Jack Daniels they had. It was so funny to watch those two run into trees and trip over stuff. And the stories they told, and the songs they sung, the dances they danced...good times. Then the hay! i swear, we threw like 3 bails of hay on the fire, the flames were like 10 feet high. At first i didn't think i was gonna clear the pit, but they convinced me and MAN! We like burnt all the hair off our arms. Derek L and Kev C burnt the hair on their heads (get rid of the shags boys!). Kev, your bike hasn't been stolen, I rode it home. Hey, don't be mad, I wasn't gonna wait around your house all day, and it woulda taken me all day to walk. It was the only sensible option. Don't worry, I'll drop it off next weekend. Or you could come and pick it up if you want it earlier...Gotta run before Kevin kills me guys, till next time!

      Ok, i"m sorry that I haven't posted in a while, but exams screw everything up around here. First things first, after discovering the age of Ashley, I'd like to withdraw my previous statement and apologize to all of you. Sorry Ashley, maybe when you're older.(But that doesn't mean we can't hang out). Also, EXAMS WERE NUTS!!! I'm not talking about the actual exam though, it's what happened after each one. EB Games is open in Cornwall!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!! I'm that excited about it. I went there after my second exam to see what they have and ended up buying The Getaway and signing up for their edge card. Third exam, we went cruising in Corey Cooper's car. He's just hooked up two 12" subs with a 600W amp. I was getting a massage the whole ride, my ears were ringing. The fourth exam (today) was a bitch. I hate math, and now I've gotta go to summer school to get it. After that, we went cruising in Corey's car again today. This time we had the top down, the shades on, and we drove slowly in front of the school jammin' to the tunes of Guns n' Roses (take me down to the paradise city, where the grass is green and the girls are pretty...). My sister has been having her birthday party all FREAKIN' DAY! But we went to go see "Around the World in 80 Days" and I ended hooking up with Mikeala (and unfortunately, her boyfriend too) and we all went and watched the Chronicles of Riddick (sorry Kev, you missed your chance). Man! That movie is awsome! So much action...and I'm not just talking about Mikaela and her boyfriend here either. But I still managed to whoop Mik's ass in the arcade before the movie started. (he, he, I've still got the skill) Good times, good times... P.S. I should now be going back to my regular posting habits of near-daily posts, so don't you fret, I'll have plenty of stories to fill your boring little lives with now that summer is here. Till next time!

      That's all the screen said all last class today. We had a pizza party and we were playing GT3 all class. Rodney and I owned everybody! Also, the Roadmobile is home today! I'm gonna test it out. If I post again, you'll know I survived. Kev, u gotta come out for a ride next weekend! That thing isn't so bad, I'd walk away from an accident on it (in about ten different directions, but that's not the point). Well, I gotta go test that contraption. Till next time!

      I know you guys don't like all this mushy, gushy stuff, but a have to do it. Ever since the First Aid weekend, I haven't been able to get her off my mind. Ashley, I'm yours forever, don't ever change. See you at Cadets caring 4 Canada tomorrow!

      Today, we had some strong winds during math class. So of course we all went to try fly our kites. Ours just doesn't want to go up, on the other hand, Isaac's group's kite didn't seem to want to come down! It just kept flying higher and higher. I swear to God man, that thing was like 300 feet in the air! they were flying it over in the G.V. field and the actual kite was way over at the far end of our field. When it finally decided to come down, it almost came down on the little kids doing track at our school. Imagine the headlines if it had hit them: INSANE, OUT OF CONTROL KITE KILLS PIPSQUEAK DOING TRACK & FIELD. It's not funny man, it almost happend. Cuz when it came down, it came down swooping at our heads (did someone say broken neck?). Yup, that kite rates about a 8.1 on my weird-shit-O-meter. Just another day in the life of Colton McRae.  -P.S. If you read this Ashley, please don't get mad at me for the previous posts. I couldn't think of much else at the time.

      Anyway, on the first aid weekend, all the cadets agreed that I was the best group leader out of them all (WOOT! GO TEAM ODHA![O-da-ha])Yeah, it rocked. The test was mongo easy, I was the first one done. Incase you haven't noticed, I'm done with Amanda, Ashley is now in! But the difference this time is that I KNOW that she likes me back. I'm getting kicked right now, so i'll finish today's events later tonight (when the parents go to sleep). P.S. Ashley Ceasor is da bomb!

      First, sorry about not updating the 'ol blog in a while, I was gone all weekend. I was gone to my first aid weekend with the cadets. IT ROCKED!!!!!!!!!! (a lot of hotties). I really got popular with the ladies during the weekend with my quirky ways of acting. About the whole masturbatos thing, it all started with a little mis-communication. In the IMPs (really crappy meals), there are these instant mashed potatos. I hear something else (you know the rest), then we elaborated with that and decided to call it the white, creamy, sticky snack that all women LOVE. (especially Natalie and Mikeala). I really got down with this one chick (one of the hottest ones there.) named Ashley Ceasor. I almost got into the female cabin! But the damn officers wouldn't let me. (I walked her to the door and she tried to bring me in, but damn CPL Landry caught us. Yeah, we hung out together a lot, she even went fishing in my pants! (Kev, I'll elaborate on that next time I see you.) I'm too lazy to post the rest right now, I'll probably do it later tonight.

      First, before I start today's events, I'd like to apologize for missing yesterday's post, and I'd like to add that both today and yesterday are going to be in this post. Tuesday was nuts! The storm was insane!(it happened just after i posted tuesday's events) I swear, there's this tree about 20 feet from my house, the rain was soo heavy that i could barely make out the shape of the tree through the rain. Then the power started flicking on and off until it eventually went right out. Of course, this didn't affect me, I was in the living room surfing the net on my laptop. I just kept going for about another hour before my battery got too low. We felt so stupid sitting in the house with no lights when just about everybody else on our road had their generators running. We were without power for about 5 1/2 hours. Yesterday was akward too. I had to explain to my religion teacher that I didn't finish the homework because I had no power to do it (Of course, he didn't believe me). We also started our kite projects in our math class. As for today, I was lucky. I only had a half day of school. We finished watching this video about HIV and AIDS that explained that sex is the main way of getting it (Yeah, like that's gonna stop me). In auto, we made a decision that we'd never get the rear wheel on the road mobile in time, so we decided to put the track back on and attach it back together by running wire through it. Then I pulled an incredibly stupid move. I left the instructions for my auto I.S. in my locker when I left school (It's due tomorrow)! I left school at noon today because we had to go to the burial service for my grandpa. Then we went back home for the rest of the day. TUNE IN TOMORROW TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT COLTON'S I.S. GETS FINISHED OR WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE HE GETS IN!

       WHY DOES IT HAVE TO RAIN!?!  It sucks that it rained today (it always messes up the gel in my hair). According to the weather channel, it's supposed to rain tomorrow too. Oh yeah, I almost forgot! On to today's events. Today started off with civics class, the teacher was back today so fun time is over. Mind you, it's not like any of us listen to her anyway. We talked all class and didn't get any work done (again). Man, I'm really starting to fall for Amanda, I gotta make a move before I lose my chance (if anyone has some suggestions, you can post them in the comments section of this post). Math class wasn't too much fun (test, Ugh!). Lunch was fun, I brought duct tape to school and went down the halls taping up lockers. We also taped up Mike Beauvais' shoes (moon walk anyone?). Duct tape is so useful, it even gave me extra grip on my shoes! We spent religion class in the library on the computers doing questions. I had to stay after class to finish the questions (I was goofing off all class). In auto shop I had to call on my trusty D-tape again! We used it to fix the seat on the road mobile, then we pimped it out by spray painting it black. Oops, I almost forgot, most of you should already know about the road mobile. But for those who don't, the road mobile is my I.S. for auto, it's an old beater of a snowmobile that I brought in to put wheels on, right now we need some parts to finish it, but it's gonna be bomb! (oh yeah, I did take Rodney's cart for another spin, in the rain! That was interesting.)

      Hello everybody, I'm posting from our room in Fredricton, New Brunswick. We're in a suite at the Delta hotel, AND THEY HAVE FREE HI SPEED INTERNET! Today was day one of our trip. We left at about 7:45 this morning. Our van has a really nice ride and all the leg room I could want. And as you've probably already guessed, it absolutely poured rain almost the entire way here. The ride was long, we were in the van for about a total of 12 hours. I'm really glad I brought my minidisc player along for the trip, it kept me sane. Since I didn't have a power inverter or a charged battery, my laptop wasn't of much use to me during the ride. Hopefully tomorrow if all goes well, we'll be able to make it to our house in Nova Scotia where we're staying for the week. I don't know when I'll be able to make the next post (connections aren't as plentiful as I had hoped), so I'd like to say hi to Kev, Mikaela and Ash. So far I'm enjoying the trip a lot, the scenery is beautiful. Until next time,  This is Colton signing off from the east coast!

      I hate having chores! I had to get up at 8:30 this morning to do stupid chores. Here's a rundown of the list:  -Take out the garbage (the 3 bags in the garage that weigh about as much as I do) -feed, water, and walk the dog (screw walking it! I hate that damn dog) -feed and clean the ginuea pigs (that wasn't so bad) -vacuum (all three floors!) -mow the lawn (oh, you mean that huge-ass field outside?) -empty and reload the dish washer (that wasn't so bad either) -cater to our every whim and give us money (ok, I made this one up, but its pretty close to that!)  And guess what! There'll be more of them tomorrow! YAY! (lights chore list on fire) I doubt I'll be posting tomorrow, I might saturday (from a hotel room! I love my laptop)] Till then, this is Mr. Slave signing off  P.S. We pick up our van today!, I can't wait to see it, all together now, LEG ROOM!!!

      Hey everybody, I'm happy to announce  SUMMER SCHOOL IS FINALLY OVER!!!  I'm soooo happy! Now I can finally do something Kev, that is, when I get back from the east coast in a week (hehe). I'm also happy to announce that I passed summer school with an 81% average, the second highest in the class. This is a good thing, this means I get my G1 in September (damn you late birthdays, damn you to hell!). The teacher put on the movie "Inspector Gadget" today (ugh!), but I was smart, I brought my laptop to school and was sitting at the back of the class playing Wolfenstein 3D the whole time! My parents have been a little uptight lately getting ready for our trip (we leave on Saturday). We got a new van for the trip because I don't have enough leg room in either of our vehicles to sit in the back for 16 hours. So we bought a  urlLink Honda Accord , the biggest in the class. We're going to pick it up tomorrow, I can't wait! FINALLY, LEG ROOM! Oh yeah, I'll be bringing my laptop on the trip so I can keep you guys updated with what happens on the trip (and to keep in touch) Thats all for now, and as Mikaela would say, written with love, sealed with a kiss, Colton McRae (yeah, I know it sounds weird coming from me)

      As todays title suggests, all we did in math class today was watch Wallace and Gromit. It was fairly amusing, but it got tiring around the third episode. I went to EB Games today (again) and bought&nbsp; something (again). I bought a fourth paddle, now multiplayer games can be fully enjoyed. I know the guys at EB so well now, it's "Hey man, so what's new in life" when I walk in. I'm getting ahead of myself here. Let's start at the beginning of the day, I woke up late this morning and was doing everything at about 100mph trying not to miss the bus. I did make it. That's all I can think of for today. Oh yeah, Mikaela, don't let life get you down, things will get better, I promise.

      Oh my god! That road party was great! Kevin, I know you're gonna hate me after this post, but it was a killer party. For one thing, I must've put about 10km on the SUV last night driving people around (and myself). I had a fair bit to drink aswell, even my mom gave me beer! We had fireworks and everything, Travis almost blew his face off with one when we thought it had gone out, but it all of a sudden exploded just before he grabbed it! We were mean to Travis too, he went to go sit down (in my seat) and just before he sat down, I pulled (my) seat out from under him and he took a one way trip to the ground. He spilt his beer all over himself, Seleena was laughing her ass off at him. But hey, nobody takes my seat. It was funny too, I was the designated driver last night, and I had about as much to drink as my parents had. But they couldn't tell I had been drinking, I kept the truck on the straight and narrow the whole way home. There's sooo much more to this story, but my fingers would fall off if I typed it all right now, I just gave you the highlights. Cathrine: Where'd this baby goat come from, did the goat have babies? Colton: No, the dog did. All: Laughter Man, that was a terrific party. Well, I'm done for today, see ya!

      That's right, I got money. I went to my grandpa's place today after school. I moved a couch downstairs, cut the lawn, and swept the driveway. I made $40! Then I got to drive home. I still don't even have my G1 yet, and I've driven sooo many times. I'm home alone tonight. The stupid dog ran away and I had to go get him with the car, without my parents knowing. But hey, what they don't know won't hurt me. I'm also going into my math exam with an 84%, YAY FOR ME! That's all for tonight.

      That title represents two things. One, I beat Spiderman2. The second, and more important one is that I helped two innocent ladies get their car started, I wasn't easy either. We tried hooking up to another car, that didn't work, so then we had to puch it over to the auto shop and boost it there. It was great. As a reward, I got to take their car for a spin around the parking lot. YAY! Man, I watched the vids from E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) for the new Sony PSP and Nintendo DS! They were FUCKING INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!! The grapics on the little systems rival those of the game cube and PS2. Plus, WIRELESS GAMING AND WIFI GAMING!!!! For those who don't know what that is, basically playing over the net via a wireless network. There's soooo much packed into those two little units, I can't post it all here. I've become really good friends with the guys at EB Games, I'm there like everyday. So they showed me the vids. Oh yeah, as far as math class goes, I've got a 79% avg. right now. I keep it up, and Coltons getting some really nice things for his birthday this year. (No, I don't always refer to myself in the third person, it just suited here). That's it for this post, See ya!

      Hey guys, I've got some news, I bought 007 Agent Under Fire. I'm pretty glad, I needed a 4 player FPS (First Person Shooter) for my PS2. I have 3 paddles right now, I'm gonna buy a fourth soon, maybe the airflow wireless...Today's math class was pretty boring, I was done all the work WAY ahead of everyone else and basically sat there for an hour and a half. I swear, if I didn't have my Mini Disc player, I'd go insane in that class. I was nervous today because today the battery was dangerously close to dying (I haven't bought batteries in a while). I made $40 yesterday at my grandpa's house. I was helping him clean up and set up everything in preparation for some people that came over from Ireland. Man it was hot, I had to work without a shirt all day. (Oh yeah, showin' off the muscles, j/k). That's all for today

      I say that for lack of a better title. Oh don't look at me like that, you read this post and tell me if YOU can think of a better title. That's right, you can't, because this post sucks too much.&nbsp;But not a whole hell of a lot happened this weekend.&nbsp;I did basically nothing Saturday until I went over to Kev's house. Then we played video games all day. I woke up today, packed up my stuff and left. My mom let me drive home again today, I don't get my G1 till September and yet I've already driven like 15 times. Ashley, I love you baby. Since this is such a short post, I'll give you a little piece of wisdom. Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday. Think about that one, it'll keep you busy until my next post (hehe).

      I'm sorry to all of you, I've just been having a bizzarro week, and well, I just haven't had the time to post. So, I'm happy to announce that I'm currently holding a 71% average in summer school (YAY! that meansI get my G1 in september!). Also, Ash is back from camp (that calls for another YAY!). This week I also discovered a method of playing Spiderman 2 at EB Games. I play the Xbox version, then I just save the game on the HDD and come back and continue from where I left off. God, the guys who sit behind me in my math class are so incerdibly stunned, it's not funny. They friggin sit there and attach alligator clips to my shirt. I swear, they have like ADD or something. I walked to the office (Konink Logistics Inc.) in Long Sault today, it took me about 2 hours and it poured on me almost the whole way there. I walked in to the office drenched, my dad was shoked to see me. And the first thing I said was "Have anything to eat?". I hadn't eaten since breakfast. So he gave me 10 bucks and I went and ate Subway. I'm sorry I don't hav anymore to post right now, but I will Sunday! Till then, I'm out.

      Man! Summer school isn't that bad, after class is done I get 3 1/2 hours to tour around cornwall. And because of this, EB Games has become my home away from home. So far this week, I've bought two games and traded in for the third: Xenosaga (really good RPG), Intellivision Lives! (oh yeah, old school gaming all the way baby!), and I traded in three of my old games (approx. total value of the three, $20)for Spiderman 2 brand new ($70), EB Games has this deal going on right now, (I'm talking to you Kev) where you can bring in three used games (for any system) and get either DRIV3R or Spiderman 2 for free. That's pretty good considering you usually save like $50. And Kev, I know you've got like 10 games you're itching to get rid of, there's gotta be at least a couple in that huge collection of yours. It's like gaming night in Canada lately. Ash gets back at the end of next week, YAY! Oh yeah, I forgot to mention one thing. I love ashley! So what if she's three years younger than me? She's really mature for her age, and she looks older than she is. And anyone of yous who has a problem with it, you can go fuck yourselves for all I care. Kind of a harsh way to end a post, but hey, till next time, this is Colton, over and out.

      Summer school blows! I went in Monday, and even though my mom handed the registration forms herself, I wasn't on any of the lists! Fucking dumbasses, I don't even think they know the wars over, holy shit. And even though the bus literally drives right by my road, I have to go to Bonville (like 7 kilometers) to get picked up, it can't just pick me up at the end of the road. And it doesn't stop there either, no, that'd be too simple, I finish at the half day like most people, and then I have to wait THREE AND A HALF FUCKING HOURS for my bus before I can go home. GOD! Till next time, this is Colton signing out.

      My head is spinning right now, I thought that I had lost the chance with the girl I love (if that's not too strong a word). But now I'm not sure, she says she loves me, but the type of love she means seems to keep changing, it's so hard to tell! She left for her two week camp today, I got to say good bye before she left, that's good, and once again she said she loves me. Like I said, I'm so confused!!! Today, I spent some time with my dog Rusty, we finally untied him, and he hasn't ran away! That's a good sign. He really is a smart dog. I can't think of anything else to post today, except that I start summer school tommorrow (ugh!). At least summer school might bring some interesting stories. I'm out for now!

      Man, I got my heart broken (again) today. A couple of more hits and it's gonna be completely shattered. Damn, you know what? FUCK LOVE, who the fuck needs it? I think I musta pissed God off pretty bad, he's forsaken me to live alone for the rest of my life. But on the flip side, I went into town today, I also stopped by my Dad's office and used the T1 line to download the lastest episodes of RVB (yes!!!) That'll cheer me up, watching those stupid antics. This was a very sad post, I know, but here's a word from to the wise. Don't mess with love, all it'll ever do is hurt you and scar you. Some of you are lucky, your relationships work out, me, not quite so lucky. Sorry about this guys, hopefully next time I'll have something more positive to post.

      Canada day rocked! I went in a bit late, but after running around like a chicken with my head cut off for a half  hour, i finally hooked up with Ash, Nat, and their friend (Raven I believe). We all hung around and walked around, except for Ash, she ran every where. Man, slow down Ash, you almost killed Nat and them, I thought they were gonna have heart attacks or something. I found a flashy, blinky, thing (Ooh, pretty). The fireworks were pretty cool too, even though they didn't even last a half hour. I still can't get over the one i saw go off, it flew up in all it's shimmering glory, then started to come down, then went back up and exploded! (you heard right, they changed direction in mid air). I also met Anthony's girl friend last night, she's pretty cool, I really think her personality suits her to Anthony quite nicely. There's some other stuff that happened last night too, but I'm not gonna talk about that here. That's all for now!

      The slogan on my T-shirt. Ok, this is gonna be a long one folks, so grab a drink and sit back. Here's the summary of the past week. Ok, when we first arrived, the place looked like shit on the outside (hence the title of the previous post). I thought my mom was gonna freak out and beat someone. But once we got over the outside and decided to step inside, we were pleasantly surprised. It turns out that they had comepletly redone the interior and just hadn't got around to the outside yet. We had a beautiful view of the beach and satellite tv (kev, i had G4 techtv there!). The beach was really cool, the tide goes out like a half kilometer. And there was a lot of very hot girls in bikinis on the beach. But away from my fantasies (for now). (Oh yeah, FYI: The name of this town we stayed in is Tatamagouche. We also went to PEI, that place is awsome! there was so much cool stuff. I picked up two cool T-shirts. My fav is the pirate on that says "beatings will continue until morale improves". The bridge to PEI is 12km long and we drove the whole thing. We took the ferry back over. The ferry had gambling machines on it. They didn't supervise them, they put people on the "honour system", big mistake (hehe). I gambled away happily and lost what i gained instead of stopping while i was ahead. We went to a mall in New Glascow. Thats where I picked up the shirt with the slogan "keep it real" on it. You need to see the shirt to get the slogan. Man, someone blew a skunk away the night before and it filled the house with the smell. I thought I was gonna die! We've seen these really cool things (i don't know what they're called). They're the amphibious things that are on the first tomb raider movie. Thats all for now, i'll finish this tomorrow. bye!

      I'll explain the title later guys. I can't give much of an update right now, I'm on an express terminal and i have 10 minutes. I'm typing like wildfire right now. Mikaela, I swear to god that I've foung your long lost twin sister in a diner we ate at before we reached our destination. We were shocked when we reached the place we were staying at. The outside looks horrible, but once we got inside, it was amazing. The interior was just redone this year and they have yet to do the outside. I'm sorry I haven't updated earlier thatn this. Kev, I know you're probably wondering why don't I use my dail-up connection. Simple, long distance connection charges that I'm not willing to pay. I'll give you guys a really long and extensive post when we get to the hotel in Halifax at the end of the week, till then, bye!
