       I first heard of Olympic pin collecting on television coverage of the 1980 winter games in Lake Placid.  It seemed as if the people walking around with pins covering their hats were having lots of fun and meeting people in the process.  But it wasn't until I attended an Olympics that I had the slightest inkling of desire to actually collect pins. 

  My collection began modestly, with a few pins picked up at convenience stores in and around the city.  I had no understanding of the value of different pins, nor did I care; I chose pins that had meaning for me.  For example, my first purchased pins depicted the three sports we attended (basketball, baseball, and rowing) and the highway on which we drove into Atlanta (I-85). 

  We began hearing that some of the corporate sponsors who had erected kiosks around the major venues would give out pins if asked.  During one particularly hot and humid afternoon, we had ducked into an AT&T pavilion (air-conditioned!) and decided to ask.  The clerk obliged with a pin for each of us. 

 It was my son's second sponsor pin; his classmates had all been given Sports Illustrated pins before school let out for the summer.  In fact, he had two because one friend didn't want his and gave it away.  He used the extra as a trader and got two pins in return.  It would take me a little longer, specifically four and a half years, before I would make my first trade. 

  While still in Atlanta, I quickly developed an interest into pins from other Olympics and other countries.  A gift shop at Stone Mountain, the massive Confederate memorial carved from what is reportedly the world's largest granite outcropping, had a set of five pins from the 1980 summer games in Moscow.  They grabbed my attention because of the history of the U.S. boycott following the Soviet annexation of Afghanistan.  I bought them and later added, mostly through eBay purchases, several other Moscow pins. 

 By the time I left Atlanta, I was hooked on pin collecting.  Most of my acquisitions have been via purchase, but some of my favorites (like an Avon lipstick I have yet to scan) were acquired through trades.  And I just got my first two Athens pins, one purchased online from a Greek woman and another given to me by a co-workers whose friend picked it up while traveling in Europe.  I look forward to scanning some of my favorite pins, posting them here, and sharing the stories that go with them.
