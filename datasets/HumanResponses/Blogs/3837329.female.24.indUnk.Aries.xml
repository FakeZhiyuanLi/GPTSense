      Been going down to city hall in the past 3 days..thurs on my own to techman, fri with ying jia to teaspa and today with many many to patara for thai food buffet..  Patara was really yummy..soo many nice food until i also dunno which one to talk abt. Was suppposed to scan the flyer..but it got wet while in my bag =( Anyway i liked the pineapple fried rice..not the normal kind of yellow pineapple rice with porkfloss on it..Instead it was pearly white, lightly covered with oil, very flavorful...the prawnys were tender and crispy--> fresh  The kai lan, green curry, pathai, stuffed chicken, soups, desserts were also very nice..  Andre played the number game and was forced to eat thai dessert..(for some unknown reasons..andre is not able to eat asian dessert one) He was trying to swallow the small piece of red bean kueh..almost teared =( Poor thing  Went down to church after tt..Urshered today...was power weekend this week..it wasn't as bad as i tot it would be.. Went to holland village's food court for dinner..soo sad,  soo many ppl were not there today..

      Tried registering online for tumor bio today..again they said i dun have the prereq...then i chanced upon a website talking abt life-sci operation center..which handles modules and prereq stuffs..at s16...  Nuaed at home till abt noon then went down..its was quite a breeze.no queue, no fuss..except tt maxey chueng asked if i was sure i wanted to do level 4000..and i jus cooly replied yes..and they waived the prereq..=)  Back in lab, talked to dexter and he said tt someone from his lab went to appeal in the morning, there was lots of ppl and they argue with maxey abt doing the level 4000...which he relented in the end..so the subsequent ppl had a easy life..hahaha..Thank God i wasn't ks and went earlier..saved me time and energy.  Went to techman in the afternoon. Bought a small new living translation bible..supposed to be easy to read..jus wrapped in up nicely =) also got "the complete works of E.M.Bounds on prayer"..there were 2 versions there..when i went home and started reading, i wondered why din i buy the other one?? this one is in NKJV language..wow..although the choice of words are more precise in its usage..its also more difficult to understand...Well well, i shall pray tt god improve my language abilities then..  Word of the day: Faith is kept alive by prayer, when faith ceases to pray, it ceases to live.

      As the saying goes, expect the worst and u will get the worst..But thank God..today wasn't as bad as i anticipated!! Hallelujah..The matirc outreach wasn't as bad as the day before..I was still terrified, but somehow the feeling was different..I think praying and lifting up these to him really work. Now i'm a firm believer that there is Power in Prayer...provided u are willing to believe what u pray and of cuz it muz be inline with god's agenda.  The helping out in the lab wasn't as busy as i tot also..the things jus came on and off..still have climbing here and there lah..but i managed to do my QC hee..  Camp meeting wa next..wow this is the first time i hear p jan talk for so long and soo near me..hahaha..i'm the finance minister..will be going around asking ppl to start saving..for the TRIP to......either desaru or batam..i like the idea of the former better. Batam has bad reputation nowadays. See how it goes lah..  Ate nice indian rojak with andre, yk and cheire after prayer..yeah!! soo yummy..and cheap..cuz 1 person only pays $2.50 =)  Very tireding and eventful day..but its all worth it

      I hereby apologise to wai kay for my insensitive remarks made previously...Often in my world of self-righteousness..i become judgemental and react without much tots.. or should i say i forgot to consult god on how to approache issues..I ask god for more wisdom in handling situations and always speak out of god's love..Yoz i'm still learning..and made mistakes along the way..

      Part of my journal for 20/7  Was having a spinning head yesterday, and i read ps 39:4-7 I cried at the verse. My soul and spirit cried out..I dunno why.  :6 Man is mere phantom as he goes to and fro: He bustles abt, but only in vain;  he heaps up wealth, not knowing who will get it  Wow! profound truth in just 2 verses..If one is able to grapse its truth, it will be life transforming  Yes Lord, show me my life's end and the no. of my days; let me know how fleeting is my life..   Why do i strive; for what do i strive? Awaken me Lord, so that my life can burn brightly. Be it a fleeting light, i will burn.. And in the end Lord i can say tt "its worth it! I have not lived in vain!"

      Today must have been one of the lousiest day i had in mths..  Woke up at 8.30, tried to looked the the time,but i wouldn't..The digits looked like they are all censored, can't see at all..Tot tt i haven't slept enough, so i went back to sleep..Whenever i woke up and try to raise my head, my brain would go spinning..in fact my whole room seemed to be spinning. could even get up to open the door..Finally i tot maybe i need my caffine boost, so i dragged myself out of bed and go downstairs...My brain was like jelly, blobbing up and down, around and around.. I felt sick..wanna puke. Cant move at all..Once i start moving my head even a bit, i would start seeing the world swim around me..  Stayed in bed from 11 to 1.30, tried everything, from praying to eating panadol nothing worked..Oh man i felt soo terrible.even leaving the room to toilet took everything out of me...It felt like a severe hangover, except i din drink the previous night..All i had was some tazo tea, supposed to aid in sleep...Well i fianlly gave up and went back into slumber, the next time i woke up, it was already 3 plus..This time my head finally stopped spinning and i could at least move abt..still felt like puking though  Went to sch at abt 4 plus..jus to keep my agar plates..so duh!! dunno why i went also..din wanna stay in the room or in the house..tot tt maybe some fresh air would do me good..Went holland village after tt to buy coffeebeans =)Oh and also a pint of haagen dazs' brandied cherry!! Soo yummy!!!..muz made up for the horrible ordeal i went thr' in morning =b  But if u ask me if i wanna have the spinning headache in exchange for brandied cherry everyday, i would rather never eat it again!! Still puzzled abt the dizzyness..dunno what cuz it..

      Woke up a couple of times today, but each time i woke up i would go back to sleep again..and by the time i finally decide to drag myself out of the bed, it was already 1 pm! Wow!! i haven't been sleeping until so late for ages.. It felt soo good to be able to wake up anytime i want, having no agenda for the rest of the day..well strictly speaking that wasn't true..had wanted to go sch to remove my bacteria from the incubator..But i'm feeling so lazy to do tt..Headache, i need caffine boost.  Jus read an article on what the modern woman wants by 15-year-old Singaporean, Amanda Chong Wei-Zhen, from Raffles Girls' School, won the top prize in the Commonwealth Essay Competition that drew 5,300 entries from 52 countries. Her short story focuses on the conflict in values between an old woman and her independent-minded daughter. (http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-07-13/essay.html)  A really touching piece  quoting: "Her daughter often mocked her for worshipping porcelain Gods. How could she pray to them so faithfully and expect pieces of ceramic to fly to her aid? But her daughter had her own gods too, idols of wealth, success and power that she was enslaved to and worshipped every day of her life Every day was a quest for the idols, and the idols she worshipped counted for nothing in eternity. All the wants her daughter had would slowly suck the life out of her and leave her, an empty soulless shell at the altar."  How true is that... In our quest for success, for grades, for money, for power, acceptance,enjoyment what are we giving in exchange?? --> Our lives....Many of us chase after such things, thinking at they will give us what we truely desire, which is peace, love and happiness..But when one finally attain success, power, money, staues, material stuffs..one would then realise tt it is not where peace, love and happiness lie.. Then we start asking why? and start looking some more..but by then how many empty years would had been spent..how many more years would one had left?   How sad tt would be..

      Praise God!!! My traformation worked..  Actually was quite sad 2 days ago, cuz the no cells grew on the agar plates again..I can't remember that was the dunno no. what time i did the transformation..7 or 8x? I mean i redo my vector and prayed over everything, but still no results..By right it at least should grow on gentamycin, but even tt, no cells!! Ahhhh Hopes deferred really make the heart sick.. I was walking in defeat; slowly negative mind set jus creaped in..Although i know i should lift everything to god, but i was really getting sick of repeating so many times. i dunno why should i even carry on..  Yap my human logic tells me tt perhaps i should withdraw, cut my loses..But some how within my spirit i felt tt i should continue and trust god.. I cried out to god, i really did..i need some confirmation..cuz the deadline is drawing near, in fact it is today.. I kept coming across readings, scriptures that tell me to lean on god, and twice i came across 1 sam 17:32-37 about David when facing Goliath, he had faith that god would pull him thr...Because previously God helped David in killing a bear and a lion.   David's exp taught him tt he could trust god's faithfulness, and i felt tt in a way God is telling me to trust in his faithness too, to remember how he had pulled me thr' in the exam 2 sem ago, and in my metabolism tests...Phew i must say its really hard to do when i have failed in my expt so many times..  But praise God, i actually had 200 ul of the bacterial left from 2 days ago i just plate it out..not really expecting anything..But lo and behold i saw 2 colonies growing on the plate..hmm so few; usually transformation will get quite a lot..I needed to do futher tests to check with the 2 are truely what i wanted..Frankly speaking i have quite little hopes at 1st..But for some reasons i was very excited abt them, even yesterday..kept opening the incubator to see if they have grown..haha only put them in for like 1 hr. This morning the first thing i tot abt when i woke up was the 2 tube of bacteria in the incubator..Can't explain why, there was jus hope and excitment within me (not to mention fear)when i was going to sch..I even dreamt abt them growing..and they did!!!! why am i so happy?? becuz i added 2 antibiotics to the medium--> only bacteria tt are resistant to both the antibiotic will grow.. the chances of contaminating bacteria growing is lower.. so if they grow it means there are chances tt they cells are what i'm lookinng for.  They grew!! they grew!! 1st hurdle cleared!! did a isolated the plasmid (circular dna) and ran on gel..hmm looked at there is something interesting..so i carried on the do pcr and restriction digestion (sorry ppl who hav eno clue what i'm talking abt). Now these are the acid tests, if they are positve..i have my clones..if not then i need to do transformation again =( I jumped when i saw the gel...I saw bands!! yes!! yes!! i got my transformants.. i cannot believe it..1 mth of work, 2 colonies, both positive!! i hope i'm not dreaming  All glory to God! He pulled me thr' once again

      Coffee brewing is as much of an art as it is a science. The history of coffee brewing devices is rich, and methods of brewing are culturally dependent. Of the thousands of coffee machines and brewing devices invented since the advent of coffee consumption only a few have gained worldwide popularity. The methods discussed below are recommended since they have been found to maximize the extraction of the beneficial flavors of coffee, while minimizing the extraction of bitter and undesirable components.  General rules: The following general rules apply to each brewing method discussed. Coffee should be brewed for 4.5-5 minutes using a ratio of 55 grams of ground coffee per liter of filtered water (195-205°F). It is convenient to use 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of filtered water. Filtered water and spring water are recommended. Tap water imparts off flavors to the coffee and since some minerals are essential to coffee flavor, distilled water is not recommended.  French Press: The best way to control the time and temperature is to use a French press. The French press offers unparalleled flavor due to perfect extraction time and delivery of the volatile oils that are often trapped in filters. A French press is also the least expensive brewer available. To brew in a French press: boil the correct amount of water, freshly grind the beans using a course setting, remove the plunger, place the grounds at bottom of the glass, add the hot water, stir by shaking, and after 4-5 minutes press the plunger down to separate the grounds from the extracted coffee.

      Haps at bukit timah's mac till they close with emily yesterday...The rest of the girlies cheesecake and fishie went home after dinner at Johnson's duck (yummy). Cheire wasn't around, she went to dinner with family, ky and jia bin dissapeared right after service..dunno where they went to also..haa  Johnson's duck is soooo yummy..like peiking duck, roasted to perfection and the smell was enough to start one drooling hahaha..Plus the super tender herbal chicken, tau fu, and green veg..it was simply good =b Its a joy to eat good food, one of life's little pleasures.  Mac was great too..we decide to go there after following aundre play pool with the arts engine ppl..Frankly, i dun like tt place..i simply can't think of anything good in tt place.. Its jus the wrong atmosphere..and very little class in it..  After buying the 25 cents mac ice-cream, emily realised that she had forgotten to bring her lactase pill..hahaha and i had to help her dispose off the ice-cream by flicking it onto the tissue paper (she wanted the cone =%) It was quite a hilarious act, at least according to her...  My half brother's wedding today..well sort of..they came over to serve my parents tea..and me and my brother had to serve them tea..(got ang bao..so i dun mind haaaa. Soo many ppl came today, not enough seats and i ended up hidding in my room with my cats (they shy too). Had vegetarian buffet for wedding lunch  By the time i got back it was already 4, spent the rest of the day sleeping... There goes my sunday...

      Yeah!! i watched brother bear on saturday..so happy. Yap and its indeed very nice..   Outline: A young Inuit hunter seeks vengence against a bear, only to be magically changed into a bear himself, and his only chance to change back is with a talkative bear cub.   I even cried hahaha..Felt so sorry for the poor little bear when i heard how his mother was killed by Kenai where trying to go on her own business..It made me reflect on what is right and what is worng...Kenai tot that the bear had stolen the fish and trying to attack him..in the process of fighting the bear, his eldest brother got killed..Anger and rage drove him to revenge and finally killing the mother bear..  But in actual fact it was kenai himself who had not tied the fish (irresponsible on his part) so the bear came to eat..The bear was in actual fact trying to protect her cub from the monsters (humans). The elder brother died because he was trying to protect kenai from the mother bear..So the mother bear had no direct play in killing the eldest brother..But anger clouded kenai's mind..He failed to see that it was his own recklessness tt caused all tt to happen..He blamed everyone except himself.   Very often our views are one-sided and we always think that we are right, but this might not be the case. There is always trhe other side of the story.

Went for the lab meeting today, mostly stuffs tt dun concern me..1 and 1/2 hr of trying to look intelligent at the same time covering up for my yawns and trying not to fall sleep (which i'm prone to)  Watched intolerable cruelty staring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones an hour ago. Been nuaing around my room since then..   Plot Outline: A revenge-seeking gold digger marries a womanizing Beverly Hills lawyer with the intention of making a killing in the divorce.  Was an ok movie i guess..Today is friday so wanted to relax a bit..Rented this dvd near my house for guess how much--> $2.50 only!..Yes i din type wrongly its $2.50...can even get the not so new shows at $2. The only catch is tt i need to return within 6 hrs if not will cost more..Sian mux walk back to my market soon, before 12.30 am =( The good thing is tt its 24hrs all computerized.  There are couple of others that i feel like watching..such as brother bear, the itanian job, mona lisa's smile etc Renting DVD really beats going to the theathers..can u imagine, asking 4 other friends to watch together and each one of us paying only 50 cents..haha  I wanna watch around world in 80 days by jackie chan..ahh seemed like nobody wants to watch with me =(  YEah dun need to go sch tomorrow!! so happy can sleep till late late liaoz.

      Jus came back from fong seng..Ate my dinner at abt 9pm.. for some reasons i wasn't hungry at noon, so i had a very late lunch at 4pm ( the cai fan..aiyoh the dishes forever dun change one)  i think i had a very fulfilling day..met up with ying jia for lunch, (though i drink only a full cup of mango juice) haven't done tt for awhile... Met up with Emily after tt, supposed to be praying for the cell today, but we ended up talking and talking...I decided to heck my gel which was running, praying tt it was on timer and the dna don't run out into the silly buffer..Its indeed a joy to talk to her, sharing abt God and other stuffs..Its true tt iron sharpens iron..we all need someone to be there to support us thr' life..  Totally forgotten that there was badminton today..aiyoh, i must be getting old..Heard tt they had alot of fun (last week i think nobody went...heee) Anyway fishie and cheesecake din bath again!! ahhh how could they =  Cell was great, and supper was even better..Had cheesy mushroom prata (everyone say: WOW! and drool..haha) I even thank god that we had chance to talk more with shumin..Yoz girl, thanks for sharing so much tonight.  Ohh haven't talk abt my lab yet, O well i am cutting the vector again..partial digestion happened..then i accidental put the thing into 60C and killed all the enzymes, so have to add more enzyme..but guess what?? the enzyme finished =( Even so, my mood felt lighter today..not thinking of dropping tt much..maybe because my boss in good mood today too.. (Dunno how long it will sustain though..i need my transformation to work soon! i'm going mad)

      Hallelujah the blog i wrote yesterday finally got posted. Been trying to see it online since last night and this morning..Was on the verge of giving up already..What an unreliable host..  Anyway the thought of going to watch spiddyboy 2 had been on my mind since last night..Not tt i like spiddy or the show, but just that i'm sick of going lab and repeating expt tt are most likely to fail anyway. ( see what repeated failures do to oneself) And of course was wanting to fellowship with the ppl also..  The show itself sux, jus as i tot it would.. Barely kept awake throughout the show..Spiddy looked more like a mutated goldfish with his poppy eyes, the plot was expected and ther wasn't any real climax to it..Lousy super-hero show in my opinion...But still beats going to the lab =)  Went Cafe Cartel for lunchie before the show with my exercise cum going home buddy, Cheire and Chermaine..Hui Ying came and joined us half way through..Discovered tt sun kissed tomatoes are great tasting stuffs..was quite amaze tt cherie could identify it at a glance, even the waitress didn't know what tt weird looking thing was..  Went sch late in the afternoon, but jus for awhile..Gonna give myself one more week to do the expt..if continue to fail, i probably would wanna drop.

      Why would anyone want to write a blog, telling the whole world what they did with their lives. In my opinion its either they have so much free time, so that they can record their boring and insignificant lives or they are so ego to think that the world wants to know their story..(which would be insignificant anyway)  Actually tt wasn't my intended starting..But i accidentally pressed some button and the entire broswer shutdown.Darn  Ok back to my insignificant life..As the days go by i'm getting more and more negative abt my UROPS project. The stupid transformation simply refused to work. I had faithfully repeated so many times. Even knowing that thr honous girl in my lab is also faced with the same situation din help much. I still feel just as bad..David decided to drop out of UROPS..Perhaps i might want to consider the option too...I'm at a lost...I wanna belive that god would pull me thr' but i just get more and more tired as the days passed.  Went jogging to jurong point with cheire just now..exercise is good therapy in times of stress. Bought a rice cooker for my grandma..(hmm the one a bought 2 mths ago spoilt...How did tt happen?)  Had a bad dream before going jogging..Something to do with demons. I feel tt i'm under spiritual attack..That made me mad too..It used to be peaceful, no weird nightmares. I will pray over my room and evade all unclean spirits out. My room will be a place of power filled with the loving presence of god.  I wanna go for spiderman 2..i dun feel like goin lab.

      Getting lazy to write these dayz...many limitations as to what am allowed to write, lest i offend ppl.. So alot of these are superficial, on surface kinda stuffs...which  is of no real value anyway..(why huh?? its my blog lei..I guess all things are permissible, but not all things are benefical)  Very often i think a lot of us go thr' life like tt too..we talk to ppl around abt superfical things..things of no significant..lest they know our tots and secrets...How many ppl truely know me i wonder?? Not many..Maybe i dun even know myself. Maybe its when we stop focusing on ourselves, or on how we perceive ppl look at us, then the real us would surface.  Ok back to insignificant stuffs.. -i spent a night over at cherie's place on sat..supposed to have the cell coming..but in the end only yk joined it..watched 13 turning on 30 and 50 first dates..werid watching with a guy i must say.  -Hmm went for sp class on sun, then went to watch fireworks at millenia walk..Soo pretty!! Yeah! I hated the crowd after tt..wanted to go home, but the mrt was filled with ppl..oh man! so ended up chilling at rocky master near bras basah..Got a free half cup of coffee =)  -Was drained totally..so decided not to go out on mon (national day) Ended up going cherie's place for sphagetti..she cooked..plus salmon..then watched "Love actually"..Very blur..din get to see the ppl's faces ... (actually i enjoyed myself nuaing..hee) Yeah thanks for inviting!......Then at night..i did something to my lamp wall and blew it up =( sparks flew..blackout..then dunno how to fip the power switch outside..so call the mantainence ppl to come..in the end it jus took 1 sec =( soo silly! blackout for >1 hr  -Today--> sch starts..but did i mention tt mine only starts on thurs??hahaha..slept till 11am haa..went sch at 2..meet emily at 4..wanted to pray for ppl,but din get to do much..sigh..ate dinner with cherie at je coffeeshop..came home prayed abit..Oh and btw i got my jap 2..hahaha fpr jus 1 point..Yeah..ppl bidded till 500 over points the 1st round..i got it only for 1..hmm actually i already got a feeling tt it would happen..Thank GOD! i need to save points for personal finance manz..God always know whats he is doing =)

      A break from my usual sunday..normally i would stay at home and rest on sundays..but from this sunday onwards, would be having sp course till next mth..Feels soo werid, having to go church on sunday...But oh well i'm quite excited to go for the course lah..Want to learn more! After KWUB, i realised that tenet classes are really a place to equip and not just tt..Its a place where the spirit can prompt and start working too..soo i'm having quite a lot of expectations from this course..  Went to eat with huiying, kenny and frank..eat jap food at tamago..(i think so lah) its after thomson plaza..the food there was quite yummy, very sweet and salty hee..me and huiying had oyako don, the guys have terriyaki don and ramen..kenny also ordered sotong..but too bad i dun like sotongs..hahaha  Started raining half way where we were eating and non of us brought umbrella..soo the 2 nice guys have to go and get the car while we waited under the shelter...=) Dropped off opp thomson plaza..actually was wanting to take a bus to clementi..its 166 i think..but dunno why it went like futher and futher..and went bugis!!! i was sitting on the bus, wondering where is this bus bring me..it was quite exciting i muz say..uncertainty..Decided to drop before simlim lah..cuz i very scare it will bring me to serangoon... Soo werid, how did i ended up going bugis?!!  Well since i was already there, i went to simlim (close to 8 already) but most of the shops were closed or closing..soo sad....was in quite good mode though..cuz i had miraculously ended up in bugis..the night was so beautiful... Walking alone, on a busy street..i almost broke out into a song haha..funny thing is i kept hearing thunder like sounds in the sky..took me awhile to figure out...It was fireworks!! the one tt huiying was talking abt..she wanted to go, but no one wanted to go with her...I got really excited man... walked faster, kept peering at the sky, hoping to get a glimpse of it.then i saw it!! AHH soo pretty!!   Although it was only for a short while, i was really happy..Coz i saw what i din plan on seeing. Its like someone coming to u and bless u with a 100 bucks..Now i know why i was in bugis =)
