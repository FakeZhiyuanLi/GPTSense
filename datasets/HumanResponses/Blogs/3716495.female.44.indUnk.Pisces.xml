      I've been thinking a lot over the course of the past 24 hours about why it is that so many people are overweight in our country and why so many are stressed out. I've actually come up with some rather novel ideas...meaning that someone may have thought of this already but I haven't seen any writings on it as of yet.  First, let's cut to the chase and talk a bit about obesity. We all know the reasons that people get fat; too much food and too little exercise, right? But why is it that we are eating so much more than we used to and exercising so much less? (There are studies that support these two suppositions, but I'm not into doing all the reference work. So if you don't believe me, Google it.)  I would submit that the major reason that so many American are obese and unfit is because they lead such hectic lives that nothing really satisfies them. They flit from activity to activity like hummingbirds flit from flower to flower, never pausing to rest or slow down until they drop from exhaustion at the end of the day. What the hell kind of life is that? Oh yeah, you get so much done and you are "living life to the fullest"; never missing a minute of time. I submit to you that your are all kidding yourselves and part of the symptoms that you experience are overweight and stress.  Let me explain. When you go through the McDonald's drive through, wolf down a Big Mac, Coke and fries while driving what do you really taste? When you sit down to a meal at home and you have the TV on while you eat, are you really tasting that chicken while watching the evening news? When you grab an ice cream while out walking down the street with friends, do you really taste more than the first few bites before you get wrapped up in conversation and your tastebuds get frozen from eating too fast? (There is another study that was done that supports the idea we only really taste and enjoy the first 10% of any dessert we eat. Interesting, yes?)  I think there is an epidemic of overeating related to the hectic pace at which we live our lives. We never slow down to really savor a smell or a flavor. We don't slow down enough to even truly chew our food properly half the time! Is it any wonder that our food brings us no satisfaction and we eat more and more of it to try to fill in that void? And we haven't even talked about the stress that accompanies all of this!  Okay, I know what you're all going to say to this, "I just don't have enough time!" I'll submit to you that you have more time than you think. You simply choose to spend your time doing things like watching TV, playing computer games, filling your schedule with activities and basically not even thinking about the ramifications of these choices.  What if you dropped all of those things in your life that are not really and truly making your life better? Drop all the e-mail lists, the games, the social activities you really don't enjoy then use the time you free up to really taste, see, feel, hear...live. Use the time to get in that exercise that you have no time for right now. Use the time to sit down and really taste a meal so that you walk away satisfied with a normal portion of food and don't have to go back in a few hours to get another fix. Use the time to start a meditation practice or to do some yoga. Something that de-stresses you without having to have electronic input.  I have heard it said that great art derives not from what is actually put on the canvas but from the space that is left empty. How can we make a work of art out of our lives when we have no spaces? When it truly comes down to it, the finest, most important work of art you will ever produce throughout your lifetime is yourself. Why not try to find those spaces today that will help to make your life something where you can find joy and satisfaction in the only place those things truly reside; the spaces in between.

      No, not in an airplane. Personally, when it come to planes, I hate to fly. No, this is something much more visceral and immediate than getting in a big metal tube, sitting cramped up in a chair for hours on end while putting your life in someone else's hands who may or may not be sober, awake or both. This is about learning to fly in a couple of very mundane ways.  My first flying lesson occurred last Friday when I was at the barn riding my horse. To put this into perspective, my horse is a 21 year-old, mildy (right now) overweight saddlebred. He's a wonderful old horse who can be a bit on the lazy side and sometimes gets cranky about having to work. I love him to pieces and am annoyed by him at the same time. Kind of like a husband that doesn't steal the covers and stays out of your bathroom.  Anyway, my daughter decided to set up a small jump for Thunder and was prodding me to jump over it. The jump was all of about 1.5 ft. high, but it had some good width; maybe about 3-4 ft.   For me, jumping a horse brings to mind Christopher Reeve and others who were not even as "lucky" as he was. Jumping is fraught with the possibilities of making mistakes and paying dearly for them. I really prefer to keep at least two hooves on the ground at all times when riding, but I was feeling rather bold that day so I decided to give it a try.  Luckily, I have had some training over small jumps, but typically Thunder doesn't "launch" (get air) when he jumps. He tends to be that lazy old man who simply does the absolute minimum to clear the jump....sometimes. A lot of times he simply knocks it down. I think if he could turn around and spit on it, he would.  But not this day! On Friday, the weather was cool and apparently Thunder was feeling good. He must have thought he was young again and he decided that jumping sounded like a lot of fun. Launch? Let me tell you, he launched! We got hang time even! And you could tell he was having fun because I didn't have to ask him to go toward the jump, he did it of his own accord. Basically, he was playing!  So what about learning to fly? Well, some of you have never been on the back of a jumping horse. There is a reason people do this rather insane activity other than to compete and win ribbons. Being on the back of a very powerful animal who weighs around 1200 lbs. when he launches into the air is a feeling unparalleled by anything else.  You become one with your horse. You must move in tandem or risk being lost off his back. He lifts you up into the air with ease and grace that you could never accomplish on your own. And then there is that moment, only a breath, where you hang in the air in flight. It is just the two of you, joined as with a common spine, defying gravity and flying. It lifts you out of the mundane into a realm where anything is possible, if only for that moment. But you walk away after your finished remembering those moments of being able to  accomplish the seemingly impossible. Not a bad lesson to take away from a barn.  My next flying lesson came on Saturday evening when I found new swings at our local park. We have all experienced the weightlessness of swinging when we were children, but that feeling becomes a much more profound thing when we are adults. The movement of the swing become like the rock of a cradle or the embrace of a lover's arms. Your feet seem to touch the intense blue of the sky; you can kick clouds and lean your head back and feel the air swoop through your hair. All the while, you are nourished by this feeling of being rocked in arms that can actually hold an adult. It is a combination of feeling nurtured and thrilled at the same time.   As you swing up, your stomach lurches and you lose the sense of being tied to this earth. As you swing back, gravity takes a momentary hold on you and then, you outsmart it and are once again weightless on the back swing. Then looking down, you see the ground beneath your feet and realize that you really are, in a sense, flying.   There's a wriggling thrill that shoots up the spine as you swing ever higher, daring gravity to try to catch and hold you. Laughter erupts spontaneously and there's a feeling that you could do this for hours if it weren't for the realities of life that bring you back to the ground.  Most of you will not get a chance to jump with a horse this summer, but all of you can find a park with a swing. I highly recommend swinging as an adult. It's an entirely different experience than what you had as a child. Let yourself shed worries and fears with each lift and drop of the swing. Personally, I think we'd be better off with more swings for adults and fewer psychiatrists! And well, everyone needs a horse, they just don't know it yet. ;-)

      What do you trust in? Yourself? Your lover? Your God? Your country? More importantly, why do you trust in the things that you do?  I think trust is a matter of personal history. If you grew up in an environment where you felt safe and loved and things were stable, you will tend to be a more trusting person as an adult. You will be able to weather storms naturally that others who did not grow up in such an environment may not be able to weather as well.   On the other hand, if you grew up in an environment where you could not trust your parents to be there for you, where you were abandoned emotionally or physically, where your needs were not met or where you were abused you will have a harder time trusting anyone or anything as an adult. But that doesn't mean that you can't overcome this past history. We can all re-learn trust in our adult lives and leave the past where it belongs, in the dust behind our footsteps into the future.  I grew up in one of those environments where nothing was certain and I couldn't trust the adults in my life. They frequently told me things that I knew were not true or lied by omission. Some of them abused me physically, some emotionally, some both. There were even peers who did the same. Lied to me, pretended to be a friend and then raped me, told me they would be there for me and then caved to other pressures that took them away.   This pattern continued for me through college and my first marriage. It was not until I was in my late 20's that I found people I could trust not to lie to me or hurt me. And, of course, I was suspicious; always waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Please don't think that I am telling you that every little betrayal of trust we suffer when young results in trust issues as adults. Everyone suffers small betrayals and lies and hurt as they grow and mature. I am talking about major hurts, abuse and neglect  that causes damage to the psyche of the individual that is not so easily forgotten or healed.  So what does one do in this situation? Never trust anyone again as long as they live? Hardly. There is no way we, as social creatures, can live that way. But how to make that leap to trust that seems to elude the broken and battered among us? What is the key? Where is the magic word that will allow us to trust again? How can we know for certain that this time is going to be different and we are going to be okay and not get hurt?  The bottom line is that there is no magic here. There is not trick and there are no guarantees. We simply have to live in some very uncomfortable places and "pretend" to have trust until the real thing develops. Yep, that's right, pretend that we trust. Act like we trust. Do all the things that bespeak a deep and natural trust of a person a situation or a relationship.  The funny thing about pretending is that it tends to become real after awhile. Suffer through the uncomfortable time of pretending and, in time, the person or relationship you have pretended to have trust in either betrays that trust or builds it for you. In other words, it's not our job to build trust, it is our job to accept it and then believe in it. The burden of building trust is upon those who live with us and love us.   Is it unfair to ask another person to shoulder the burden of our past and be the one who has to pull us out of the quagmire of our own hurt and distrust? I don't think so. If the person really values us and wants that trust they will be patient (to a point...no matter how much someone loves you, they can only take so much) and allow us to pretend while they act with truth and grace. And as we pretend, we build trust each day that is real.   It's like a plunge into a cold lake on a hot day this leap into the unknown world of trusting those around us and the relationships therein. It is very, very scary for us. That gibbering voice in the back of our minds tells us constantly that we are going to be hurt or even destroyed if our trust is misplaced and the person betrays us. But that voice is not rational. It is a voice from our past. It is the voice of fear and history that we need to silence to move on with our lives.  Will we get hurt? Yes. Will people disappoint us? Yep, you bet. Will we live through it? Uh huh. Just like we have before and we'll come out stronger on the other side no matter the result of the trust we place. If it turns out to be rewarded with love and fidelity and goodness then we come out stronger and more trusting of others and ourselves. If we get hurt and our trust is once more abused we come out the other side wiser and stronger and ready to try again because, quite honestly, we have no other choice if we are to live life fully and openly and even have a shot at all the joy we would otherwise miss if we were to live constantly in distrust.

      Over the ages, people have debated these topics, written on them, waxed poetic and simply did all of them. So I figured, why should I be any different.   I have been thinking lately about each of these emotions and started to wonder how they intertwine and where they diverge. My definitions and the conclusions I come to may not be the same as yours. Like any emotion, these are very personal things...yet they are universal.   Love, to me, is the banked embers of a fire. It is something that can warm you on a cold winter's night or through a dark night of the soul. It need not be passionate, but a little tinder tends to cause it to rise up into flames of passion. Sometimes even looking at your love, examining it, can cause a spontaneous combustion of passion in your heart.   We can love many things and many people. Love knows no bounds and the passion that ensues from love is also unlimited, though not always present as it would burn itself out too quickly; destroying the vessel. We love our life partners, our children, our pets, certain activities, luscious foods and many other things. None of these loves interferes with the other and each is subject to its own inherent passion.  I love my husband and I also feel passion for him. I love my daughter, and I am passionate about her well being and her happiness. I love my horse, and I have a passion for riding and caring for him. Passion and love are inextricably entwined. I do not believe that one can love without some form of passion.  Desire is another animal. Desire makes us crave that which we love. It is the needle in the brain that drives us toward the object of our love and our passion. Desire, like love, can be banked and can smolder. Unlike passion, desire is not a white hot flame. It builds and slowly opens like the petals of a lotus.   This is not to say that desire is not a potent thing. Surely it is. Desire can drive us to heights and depths we would not normally consider. But in truth, desire also cannot be divorced from love and passion. There is an entwining of these emotions where one may supersede the other at any given time, but they all are present to make the whole.   Then there is lust. Lust does not depend on any of the other emotions above. It is a stand alone emotion. Lust is somehow cold and calculating. We can lust after a person, an object, food or wealth; but that does not mean that we love or have passion for any of these. And lust is not desire. Lust has a harder edge to it. Desire is softened by the love and passion that supports and banks it.   Lust in many ways is like anger. It is intense and flashes with tiger's eyes, but it can't sustain itself. Once the object of lust is attained, the fire ebbs and the luster is left holding a handful of sand that slips through their fingers. Lust never satisfies or brings joy for any length of time. It always leaves emptiness in its wake and one addicted to it moves on to a new object of lust.  The term lust is overused I think. It is easy to say that we lust after something because it divorces us from the feelings of desire and passion and love that can threaten our understanding of our self. But if the feelings we have are truly not lust, then calling it that is simply a sop to the self to keep us from going places where we fear to go. If we simply call something lust, we don't have to deal with those other "messy" emotions.  Let's face it, love and desire and passion are not easy emotions to live with or quell. They rise up unbidden and they are demanding as any hungry infant. They bring us to our knees to pray for mercy and drop us in the eye of the storm; waiting for the whirlwind we know is coming to shred our very souls.   But then when do we feel most alive? When satisfying lust? I don't know about you, but I never have. There was only that cold emptiness left behind after a dance with lust. No, I have felt most alive when I was in the midst of passion, drowned in desire, lifted on gossamer webs of love.   Personally, I welcome the storms of desire and passion and love. I revel in the winds that blow through me and smash me on the rock, taking my breath away and leaving me washed up on the beach of my own soul. I live for the fire that burns with the meeting of two souls entwined in this dance of life and death; not knowing which way the dance will turn or where the music will stop. I yearn to lose myself in the body and mind of another and to feel their body and mind lost in me. These feelings are not lust. They are holy in the very essential sense of the word. They make us godlike and lift us to places far beyond our normal human existence.

      Okay, so I am reading these articles in "Yoga Journal" about the different types of joy that have been categorized by the people who developed yogic practice thousands of years ago. Did any of you know that there are actually four distinct types of joy?  First, there is   Sukha   Which basically translates to "fleeting pleasure". I can also be translated as ease or comfort. It is something that can vanish in a moment. The next level is   Santosha  , or "contentment". Santosha is found through realizing that you are okay the way you are and not yearning for something that life cannot provide. It's basically being happy with what you have; something that is in horribly short supply in our society. (Hmm, maybe there is something to that one!) Moving forward there is   Mudita  , which translates as "spiritual happiness". It is a little more difficult to describe, but is something like a spontaneous arising of joy. It's the ability to see beauty in things like trash or fast food. Okay, this one is a bit difficult for my Western mind to grasp, but I kind of get it. Finally, we come to   Ananda   which is the ultimate bliss. Ananda is "ecstasy, rapture, a joy that wells up on its own from the very depths of the universe and connects us instantly to the vastness of pure being". Wow.   So those are the various types of joy we as humans can supposedly experience. I'm okay with that, but I'm having trouble with the fact that I am supposed to try to attain Ananda and stay there. I gotta tell you, if I were in the state described above there would be no laundry getting done, no dog getting fed and I would not be exercising. I'd be sitting around all day in ecstasy.  The Eastern mystics say that all those things that are mundane tasks that I mentioned should be part of that pure bliss that is Ananda. I should be able to make cleaning the cat litter a spiritual experience that brings me an overwhelming joy and deep inerconnectedness to the universe. Call me a skeptic, but I am just not seeing this, and I have excellent visualization skills!  The point of this little rant is that I feel that some of the articles in popular books and magazines give us such lofty goals that we can never achieve them unless we are able to go and live in an ashram for a year or two; away from he stresses and constraints of daily life. Sure, they are admirable goals, but how many of us feel like failures when we are unable to attain these joyous states and end up worse off than what we were when we started? Now, not only can we be unhappy, we can feel guilty about failing too!  Maybe if I really put in a concerted effort to find the joy in plunging the toilet or divine enlightenment in cleaning up cat puke I would get it. But you know what, I would really feel stupid trying to do that. I mean really, cat puke is cat puke and a plugged toilet is just a pile of shit in a drain. I simply can't make something divine and ecstatic out of that.   Now if I want to actually find ecstasy I'll go out into the woods or I'll ride my horse. If I truly want to seek out the divine in all things, I'll have sex! I can find ecstasy in these things without any trouble. When I do these simple, human acts I CAN touch the face of divinity and for those moments, I can become a Goddess.  Yes, the bliss is fleeting and the joy is not a constant and it does go away when I step in cold cat puke at 7:00 a.m. in bare feet. But you know what, those moments of joy are real and intense and they do connect me with something larger than myself. And I truly think that all of this writing about how "joy is the natural state of the human being" is really a bunch of nonsense perpetuated by people who have nothing more to do than sit and gaze at their navels all day. If joy was our natural state, then babies and small children wouldn't cry so damn much.

      I never thought I would blog. Yeah, I've read friends blogs and my husband's blog and assorted other blogs. But post my own blog for all the world to see? Nope, not for me.   First, I don't think I'm a very good writer. My thoughts tend to get away from my fingers and I can't type fast enough to keep up with them. Second, well I guess that I never really thought anyone would be interested in anything I had to say. So I am putting this blog together mostly for my own satisfaction. As a place to write my thoughts, to rant and to unload in general. A place to speculate and to dream. A wake for my tiny ship so that I can look back to see from where I have come and to help me to stay on course to where I am going.  So this is where I start. With my oh so mundane thoughts for this day.  Here in Wisconsin we are having breezy, sunny weather with temperatures in the low 70's. Perfect weather for a run with my little rat terrier Emily. It is amazing that her little legs can keep up with me for an hour of trekking through woods and on roads; running and walking and looking around to see what's new in town. But there she is, by my side the whole time. She never complains and always is enthusiastic. How can you not be upbeat and run happily with her by your side? She shows me as we run, and rest from time to time, what is truly important in life.  She stops to sniff interesting smells...I pause under a linden tree in full bloom to smell the intense bargains that I love best of all or to lean down and smell a rose that will only last this one day. We both appreciate the shade at the drinking fountain and I cup some cold water in my hand and let her lap it up with her little pink tongue and then lean over to get a drink for myself. The water is so cold and sweet that it makes me shiver as I look up through a canopy of green leaves to a blue sky that is nothing short of startling.  If nothing else, I learn that all of these things are fleeting. Soon the lindens will no longer be blooming and I will have to wait for the entire turn of another year to smell them once more. The roses will fade and the leaves will turn autumn colors and fall at my feet. The steel grey sky of November will replace the almost painful blue sky of today. The snow will fall and the cold will push me indoors to my treadmill.  The impermanence of these things reminds me of the impermanence inherent in all things of this earth. It wakes me up and presses me to to experience each moment to it's fullest; disregarding odd looks from strangers or clocks on the wall. I only have this one, precious life and I decide each day what I will do with it. In fact, I decide each hour, each minute, each second how I will spend this time alloted to me.  I can dwell in this moment and truly experience life or I can chose to dwell in past memories; both happy and regretful. But those memories are so much dust now and they truly mean nothing when compared to the immanent, demanding now of this moment. And as for the future, well I will plan with everyone else as best I can, but it's not a place to live as it does not exsist.   It seems like such a worn and tired truism that the only moment that we have is the here and now, but I think that we all need a little dog...or someone or something...to remind us of this old saw from time to time. In our hurry up world, we tend to so very easily forget that all of our time spent on this earth is measured in moments and that the only moment we can truly live is the one we are in right NOW.

      Why is it that particular songs or stories or poetry "speaks" to our souls? Is it just the wonderful crafting of words by great writers and singers, or is it something more?   We've all had the experience of having a special song that has meaning for us beyond what any other song does. Or maybe it's multiple songs or songs by a particular artist. Same thing with poetry and with stories. What is it that touches us so deeply and so profoundly in these experiences?  I think that each of us finds something in a song or a poem or story that we cannot give voice to ourselves. Someone else finds the perfect way of saying how we feel about ourselves, our lovers, our world, our past. Or it could be that they have a way of telling us where we need to go or what we need to hear and it resonates somewhere deeply inside our souls and we listen or read, again and again to remind ourselves of who and where we would like to be.  Then there's the music that simply gives us a peek into a world we would like to visit but would never have the chance to. A sort of voyeuristic 3 minutes with a song that makes us feel like someone we really aren't. (AC/DC is good for this!)  And then there are the universal truths put into words. Some great classics have these themes that resonate throughout the ages from generation to generation. Works like the "Illiad" and the "Odysessy" and most all of the works of Shakespeare. But writers from the distant past certainly do not have a corner on those universal truths. There are people wrting today like the Dali Lama and Thich nat Hanh who also speak the language of all people and express our fears, illusions and hopes for us in ways we could not ourselves.  Poetry can be a little harder for people to approach because of upbringing (poetry is "sissy stuff") and beause meanings are not necessarily apparent with one, cursory reading. Poems unfold like roses. They take time; sometimes days or even years for the full meaning to become apparent. Poems are the biggest challenge of all of these  forms of expression that invlove the written, sung or spoken word. With a poem, you're pretty much on your own, and many times, the meaning derived can be very subjective. I find poetry to be more closely related to abstract art than to other forms of word art. It's very self interperative. But that is also what makes it so gratifying in the end.  A song is a song and it's pretty easy to get meaning from it with a few exceptions. It's only when an artist puts poetry into lyrical form that we end up back with a more challenging art form that can take time to explore and really understand. Jim Morrison comes to mind immediately. But then again, some songs are simply drug induced nonsense and if you do get any meaning out of it, then you may be the one with some "issues". ;-)  When I run each morning I listen to a wide range of music. I take my MP3 player along with me and each song I have loaded in it has some sort of meaning to me or in some way motivates me to run farther, longer or harder. Some are simply "fun" and upbeat, others are wistful and make me remember or wish. Some remind me of people in my life and from my past, others tell me something about myself I want or need to hear. Each and every song I listen to has something in it from which I can glean some kernel of inspiration or allow an emotion to surface that may be too scary to otherwise confront. Some have the ability to allow me to feel anger that I would not normally let surface. Others do the same for sadness and loss. But regardless of what they do for me when I run, each has its place and each helps me to move into my day with renewed insight into who I am, where I am going and where I have been.

      I am stressed out this morning. I have been for days; weeks even. But now I am getting to that point where I can't contain the frustration I feel welling up inside when everyone needs me at the same time and doesn't give a damn about what I need.   I have an almost 11 year-old daughter who is about to drive me insane. I don't mean the "Ha, ha, I feel crazy now" type of insane but the "Please dear God's institutionalize me and let me give me a break" type of insane. I also have a husband, whom I love dearly, who is facing the possibility of losing his job and dealing with his own stress which impacts me. We live with a third adult who doesn't seem to have a clue and puts things "away" that he then swears he's ever seen or forgets where he put them. looney bin, here I come!!  This morning has been a perfect example of the kind of thing that makes me want to run screaming into the night, never to be seen again. As soon as I woke up, my daughter was knocking on my bedroom door (loudly) wanting to come in and discuss an impending horse show with me. She manages to inform me that she has to be at the barn this afternoon through evening to prep her horse and to load her tack. Okay, I can deal with that. Then she tells me that we have to be at the barn to load her horse at 6:00 a.m on Friday morning. I am seriously NOT a morning person. Now none of this would have pissed me off as much as it did other than the fact that she knew all this stuff last night, or maybe even earlier, but decided to tell me at 8:00 a.m. this morning when I am barely cognizant and feeling like I have been beaten with a lead pipe.  At this point, I'm still keeping a fairly even keel. I know I can go out and run because the illness I was suffering from yesterday seems to have abated. So I get myself up, eat (which means trying to make a small bowl of oatmeal around 2 other people who are occupying the kitchen) and then get the dog and my MP3 player and go out for a run. The run buoys my spirits and makes me feel better...for a very short time. I can't even get a drink (which I desperately need) before my daughter is in my face asking me to read an essay from schoolwork she was supposed to have finished over a month ago. All of a sudden, this has become some sort of hot priority and she can justify it by saying "it's schoolwork".   All of my runner's high evaporates in an instant and I am livid with anger. Why is it that everyone thinks that it's okay to interrupt me whenever and wherever I am? I'm serious. I have finally, mostly, broken my daughter of the habit of talking through the bathroom door at me!  Next it's the inability to find materials for her Latin class. Here's where the other adult in our household comes in. He's seen the materials, but doesn't know where they are. The kid MUST do Latin today, of course, and now the hunt is on for the Latin class assignment book. We can find everything else but that one book! So of course, everyone tries to drag me in on the hunt for the missing Latin book.   Sorry, no dice. I have had it at this point. I am trying to read e-mail, get food in my stomach, get a shower and write a blog. No, other than the food these are not "important" things really, but they are important to me and if I can't do some of the  things that are important to me I resent the people around me who deny me that ability and I am a really surly bitch. Yes, the yelling has already begun and the 11 year-old acts like a typical teenager in training with the pouting, slamming doors, going to her room and sulking.   So at the moment, the other adult just tried to look through the shit heap that is the 11 year-old's desk. She wouldn't let him saying "It's my desk" (insert whiny voice) and he simply gave up. So the Latin book is still missing and no one is looking for it. I know, that in the end, I'll look for the book. But I will do it on my time, not on someone else's. I will not let a child dictate to me how my life will run to me no matter how hard she tries. It's just that it would be so much easier if she would quit trying and get a clue as to why mom blows up and turns bright red over these things that she insists on doing.  I know this blog has been filled with interesting thoughts and novel ideas. I just wanted you all to know that I. Like you, have mornings where I want to kill someone...or run away and join the circus. I do not live a perfect, serene life. Much of my life is really wonderful, but there are those times, like this morning, that I wish I just could find a cabin somewhere and let my hair grow and eat roots and talk to the trees.   I also know that some people will say, "Someday when your daughter is gone you will miss her and wish for even a morning like this one". NOPE. Not buying it. I don't miss her being a baby; never have. I still remember getting up multiple time per night and dirty diapers and all the stuff that comes along with babies. Don't miss it one little bit! I can tell you that I will not miss a morning like this.   But then I will also not miss the wonderful times my daughter and I have riding our horses together either or the times we have long talks and enjoy each other's company. The reason I won't miss those things is because our relationship will have evolved into something new and there will be other wonderful moments to take the place of the ones that have passed.  Stress sucks. But nostalgia is overrated.
