       Some of you may not want to read this as it delves deep into a side of me that many never see. An ugly, romantic, disgustingly profound side.  In fair warning, I wrote this poem about a girl that I felt good about, but who didn't feel the same for me.  I think that's about all I need to say.     Appreciative    For those moments in time when thoughts of you occupied my mind and gave me hope and made me smile, I say thank you.  For those moments in time when age was just a number-and not a line drawn between two people who  fate mistakenly put together.  And for the passion they shared through a kiss. Even if it was the climax and not the routine- the moral but not the plot, I wholeheartedly say thank you.  And for that moment in time when “somewhat” hurt more than anything and sincere indifference left me feeling a bit naïve, a bit beaten, a bit broken. I can still, without a doubt, say thank you.  Because I understand that life is dramatic without pretense and my love is no actor- my heart is no stage. And when I awake on those cold mornings to find a script, and a spotlight, but no warm applause from romance, I will still take my bow front and center. And I will humbly give thanks for the audition.  And for those moments in time, when I could hardly bear to take my eyes from your face, my hands from your skin, my breath for my own.   I will always say thank you.  For a memory lasts a lifetime and because sometimes what you let slip away is what you get to keep.

      There's a girl at the bar and she can't dance, She's got no rhythm in her underpants, One arm is up and one arm is down, Then her feet start to moving like Charlie Brown, There's a girl at the bar and she don't talk, Breaks up with her boyfriend so she can stalk, She holds her beer and never lets it go, Dancing like Elaine on that Seinfeld show, Yeah there's a girl at the bar and she can't dance, She's got no rhythm in her underpants, The lights are on but nobody is home, She's the one that's always dancing all alone, People laugh and people point, They say she looks like an Ostrich that just smoked a joint, Yeah there's a girl at the bar and she can't dance, She's got no rhythm in her underpants, She may be tall and she may be pretty, But her body moves like a retarded kitty, So if you ever see her just stand back and watch, You'll have a good time watching her body rock.   ----------  I dunno, just a stupid rhyme about this girl at the bar that can't dance.

       urlLink    Terry and I saw this homeless guy in Daytona Beach during Spring Break.  He was wearing a skirt with a bra that was stuffed with orange socks.  He also had a beer hat on.  And he was sweeping the parking lot and waving to the cars.  Thought it was hilarious.  You can thank Terry for the crappy picture.

       No commentary today.    I need a break.   I've been avoiding making this blog highly personal until now, but I feel like it loses its therapeutic effectiveness if I lean more towards writing for mass approval and less for my own approval.  Maybe if I write with a more personal approach it will offer something different to those around me.  I'm at work and I am bored as hell.  There is a constant hum from the fans on the 13 computer servers in my office.  I will do anything to escape this hum. I've even gone so far as to find a quiet corner somewhere in the office and just stand there to enjoy the silence.  I've got a lot on my mind too.  I'm supposed to go to an interview today for a high school near my house.    Great.  I'm so excited I can hardly contain myself...  Anyway, I know I'll do well because I've developed that "winning interview attitude".  Yeah, I've been offered tons of jobs so far.  I just keep turning them down because I'm looking for one that really fits me.  NOT!    Well, I can't be too disappointed.  I'm in a pretty good situation.  No bills, no debt; I'm really just collecting the cash.  So anything above what I have right now would be a blessing.  I guess I'm just impatient because I want more.  That's the thing about human nature, we always want more.  That and it's difficult to be patient.  I'm really good at it; but it's not because I enjoy it. It's because life is force feeding me patience. It's like I'm a fat baby being forced to eat creamed spinach.     In the meantime, I'm going to look harder at those aspects of life that I need to appreciate more.  Yup, no secrets there, life is all about perspective.   For instance, it was a beautiful thing when I finally realized that it's not the money you make, it's how you spend it and how you rationalize your buying habits (i.e. Does my 800 square foot apartment really need a 500 square foot big screen TV?).  I think for any bad situation there are infinitely more positive ways to rationalize the situation.  Instead of saying I'm bummed about not having a significant other I can just tell myself that there are millions more options now.  Instead of saying my job sucks and I hate it, I can just tell myself that all bad things must end just as much as good things.  Thing is, a positive outlook is so much harder to have because it requires thought.  But in the long run I'm quite sure it is the only thing that makes the difference between success and failure.  Attitude is immensely important and it's contagious too.  Try being positive and smiling for one day at work and I guarantee everyone around you will start doing the same.  I always forget to smile.  A really hot Italian girl said that I come off like I'm too serious.  I said she was crazy.  She also said I was too young for her to date. Sure I am.  So maybe I'll try smiling more and believing less what other people are just assuming.    But I still like hot Italian girls.  They make me h-a-pp-y.    Here's the moral of the story: Any average person can give into hating this or that or the other thing and any average person finds it ridiculously easy to be negative.  Some people do it even when they are not facing adverse conditions.  Average people are the ones that always complain about what they don't have or what they can't do. Average people don't have the intellectual capacity to see that positivity is a force multiplier.  They are too wrapped up in their own selfishness to even consider how they might be helpful to anyone else.   So this begs the question: Are you average?  I sure as hell ain't.    So that's the moral.  Don't be average.  Practice smiling and staying positive and always be consciously aware of how your attitude affects those around you.  Realistically, nothing is impossible as long as your perceptions, your effort, and your attitude align your actions with your desires.   And just so you know, I will date the hot Italian girl.  How do I know?  Because in my heart I feel positive that I've got more to offer her than anyone else and that, like everything else with me, it's only a matter of time until I'm successful.  For now, I'm good to sit back and learn how to live - no matter how old I am.

      I am feeling divinely inspired upon reading this article:    urlLink  Bad Writing Article          If you do not have the patience to read the whole thing I'll summarize for you (you lazy lizard). Apparently, there is an annual contest for bad writing. I don't mean bad writing as in writing that exhibits poor command of syntax, punctuation, spelling, or grammar. I mean the highly underrated preoccupation with writing that is in poor taste-either politically or socially. I think I have found a good niche for myself here. It's like poetic justice got caught soliciting a prostitute. Most of the material is correct in content, but just plain wrong in delivery. I will say this; this upstart genre sheds a whole new light on writing for me. And man, am I inspired.     I've always held the belief that inspiration could be found in a variety of uncommon places. Who's to say that Martin Luther King Jr. didn't conceive his "I Have a Dream" speech while fantasizing about sexual innuendos with all those loose affluent white gals in the metro-Atlanta area?   See, I'm a natural.     If this writing does truly hold some sort of merit with an international committee, then I think I may enter the contest next year. I might as well. I mean, with my career booming like it is and all, I’m just not sure I’ll be able to do it after that. On that note, I thought I’d take a moment to reflect on the world and write a couple of quick commentaries in my same old same old (but now perfectly acceptable) condescending and completely offensive tone of voice. As always, please feel free to comment if something I say moves your bowels like a jalapeno milkshake.       Nate’s perfectly acceptable bad writing        Martha Stewart is going to prison. I wonder if she’ll come out with some prison tats? You know, she might get a couple to remind her of her stay in the pen. Can’t you just imagine a prime time show after she’s out? I can see it now; probably a show on FOX network called something like,  Martha Stewart’s Living: Under House Arrest .      Basically, the premise of the show is that a freshly violated Martha shows us how to make shanks from silverware and then has a daily feature on decorating small, enclosed living spaces. As a side note, she was a damn psycho before and I’m a bit worried about what is going to happen when she comes out of the big house. If the Bush Administration ever gets rid of Fidel Castro, I’m sure there will be a job for Martha in Cuba. I think she could do it.             If  urlLink  Lance Armstrong    doesn’t win a record sixth consecutive Tour de France he is a traitor and should have to live in exile. Plus, I think that Americans should widely replace the euphemism “Benedict Arnold” with “Lance Armstrong”.             Ok, so maybe I need to brush up on my bad writing skills. I think I need to work on being a more positive bad writer. Something like, “Janet Jackson’s breast looked like a chocolate pancake on my TV while I was watching the Super Bowl.”     Eh, on second thought, maybe I’ll just forget about the contest next year.

      A very good buddy of mine offered the following advice to me on life.  I'm posting it here because, of all things, it is really inspiring. But also because it's the best kind of advice; simple and startlingly profound. It goes a little something like this:          [In life]  Travel that path which seems least likely to yield a desirable outcome and you may just find the treasure for which you search   If advice were beer, I'd already owe this guy a case of Shiner Bock.  Thanks SR, you rock man.

      Ahh, a nice rainy Monday morning. Nothing quite like driving 30 miles to work in the pouring rain to get your day off to a good start.   The rain is not the only thing that is pouring out in abundance lately. In a strange turn of events, my love life has suddenly turned into a deluge of difficult choices. Like my make believe friend Billy always says, "Difficult women make for difficult choices. If they were average, they'd be boring." I agree. Nothing like a dose of confusion, misinterpretation, and misleading action to make things interesting.   For example, I have yet to understand how, at any given moment, I can share a really amazing (and completely innocent) kiss with a woman who  says  and acts like she's attracted to me. And then after having a few moments by herself to reflect decides that an amazing kiss and undeniable chemistry mean that I am, after all, obviously too young for her to ever date seriously.   Am I missing something here?  As far as I know, amazing kisses and undeniable chemistry are both really good reasons to give a guy a chance. But this, my friends, is where all the difficulties arise. Women in my life never seem to take the easy road. Everytime we have to have drama.   I'm complaining and it feels so damn good.  The funny thing is-and this is the real kicker- the women feel the same about me.    Falls out of chair laughing    I am so simple to figure out. I'm not a rubick's cube here. I know this because I make total sense to myself and I'm, admittedly, not all that good at figuring anything out. So I have a good theory for you guys today. It's a short one this time (yay!) and I think I'll call it... drumroll please                                 Nate's Complicated Woman Theory   Women, by nature, are much like quantum physics.  There is really no conclusive way to explain the laws that govern them.  And once you think you've figured one law out, it changes immediately and for no reason.  Plus, women are so infinitely complicated by nature that even when a simple solution presents itself to them, women immediately recognize that simplicity feels inherently uncomfortable to them.  So what do they do?  They make simple things immensely complicated so that it feels more "natural".      On top of this theory lies the fact that women project their complicated nature onto unsuspecting men.  I can't count the number of times I've heard a woman say something like, "That guy is so complicated.  I never know what he's thinking.  He can't make up his mind."   When you hear that, it's just a woman's way of saying (in men's terms). "He's so simple that I cannot comprehend it so he must be complex beyond any reasoning."  I like beer.  I like beautiful women.  I like laughing.  I like to have fun and I like to feel love.  All I ask is for a little mental and emotional stimulation once in awhile. That is me in a nutshell and I'm sorry, but that's a pretty simple equation. There, that proves it's not us men.  We men, we're simple creatures.  Like talking dogs with the ability to reason.    Nevertheless I cannot change anything.  So I'll deal with it.  This is how I deal with it.

       A friend sent this to me via email. Thought I'd share it here.     Are you tired of all those sissy, mushy "friendship" poems that always sound good but never actually come close to reality? Well, here is a series of promises that really speaks to true friendship!   1. When you are sad...I will get you drunk and will help you plot revenge against the sorry bastard or bitch who made you sad.   2. When you are blue...I'll try to dislodge whatever is choking you.   3. When you smile...I'll know you finally got laid.   4. When you are scared...I will rag you about it every chance I get.   5. When you are worried...I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and to quit whining.   6. When you are confused...I will use little words to explain.   7. When you are sick...stay away from me until you're well again. I don't want whatever you have.   8. When you fall...I will point and laugh at your clumsiness.    This is my oath, I pledge 'til the end. Why you may ask? Because you're my friend!   Remember: A friend will help you move. A really good friend will help you move a body.  &nbsp; Let me know if I ever need to bring a shovel.

      I thought today I'd try to relax and not write about anything even remotely inspirational. It seemed like a good idea until it occurred to me that, if there is nothing to be gained from a few hundred words of my inspiration(less) rambling, then what am I really writing for in the first place?   In all seriousness, I'd love to just take a proverbial "all expenses paid Caribbean vacation" from attempting to inspire the audience with my quaint and less often than not erudite reflections on life, but I just can't force myself to do it. I have to say something beneficial. I cannot just write fluffy narratives about my oh-so exciting real life that have not one iota of inspirational value.   Hold up, let me make an amendment to the previous statement: I  could  be monetarily convinced to chronicle my oh-so exciting real life adventures (or misadventures) so that my poor married friends may find a secret alcove on the web where they may live vicariously through me.  *     So anyway, I'm all about writing something worthwhile. Not only does it stimulate the reader's thoughts, but it generates comments too. Take note: comments are to the author as hugs are to Richard Simmons.   I am now officially a sellout. Go ahead, label me. Do it.  Nate The Comment Whore , yep that's me.    How to Control Yourself in Out of Control Situations     I've spent a good amount of time in out of control situations. I've been on both sides of the situation. I am an expert. I've been out of control so often that they suspended my license to live for reckless endangerment of others. Not really, but they would've if there was such a thing. I've also seen a lot of crazy people doing a lot of crazy "girls gone wild" type, out of control type things. Trust me on this one, I know what I'm talking about.        Lesson One: Breathe and Focus    &nbsp;

       To my buddy Terry Baugh.  This is a song I wrote about his 2 year old daughter Courtney, who is apparently not only a beautiful little girl, but she also eats the hotdogs that he brings for bait when they go fishing.  Anyway, he's a constant inspiration to me in the way he refuses to let her down (he's a single Dad) and how he is constantly a stand-up guy....thought it was the least I could do.                 Courtney's Song (the fear)   I am a man, I'm no stranger to emotions But like a stoic, I keep them locked away inside, Every day I see so many bad men, And you'd think that I would fear them, But I still lock them down and hold my head up high,  There was that time as a young man, When I volunteered for Uncle Sam, I earned my wings by jumping from the sky, I've lived that life in glory, And I've got death-defying stories, But when the day is done it's the farthest thing from my mind,   I've spent half my life doing wrong and the other doing right, Sometimes I still struggle, hell, it's just so hard to decide, But now I've got this little girl, she's the difference in my life, And if I need a reason, she's the reason I'm alive   CHORUS:               Because I know for certain that she's daddy's little girl,                I know I cried the day that she came into the world,                And every other weekend I know I have a date,                We go fishin' out on my boat and I watch her eat the bait,                Ok maybe there are somethings that I can't afford,                But I'll always try my best to give my girl a little more,                And in return, well she helps me face the fear,                Keeping me courageous everytime it comes near.   And I've seen my share of hard times, Lost my father and a bad wife, But every day I am still breathing, There's always hope and man, that's something, I guess you can't control what happens in your life.   Yeah, but every day I feel it, and every day I greet it,  I see the fear comin’ and I never blink an eye. Some people say the only difference between crazy and courageous, Is what you have at stake and what drives you to survive, For me it's more than simple, When I see that smile and dimples, And that little blonde haired baby by my side, yeah   CHORUS:               Because I know for certain that she's daddy's little girl,                I know I cried the day that she came into the world,                And every other weekend I know I have a date,                We go fishin' out on my boat and I watch her eat the bait,                Ok maybe there are somethings that I can't afford,                But I'll always try my best to give my girl a little more,                And in return, well she helps me face the fear,                Keeping me courageous everytime it comes near.    One day she'll grow up and I'll be an old man, And she'll be the one who must be strong, Courageous like her Dad, Because truth be known,  We're not here for that long and when I die I want her by my side so that I can carry on, And one last time, as I'm passing into Heaven, I'll remember back upon my life,  Smiling all the while   CHORUS:    Because I know for certain that she's still daddy's little girl,                I know I cried the day that she came into the world,                And every other weekend I knew I had a date,                We went fishin' out on my boat and I watched her eat the bait,                Ok maybe there were somethings that I could not afford,                But I always tried my best to give my girl a little more,                And in return, well she's helping me face the fear,                Keeping me courageous as the end draws near.

      Here's what I'm going to do for the rest of my life (once I find a good job): I'm gonna find an expensive top story apartment with a big old balcony where I can sit out on the porch and drink my Shiner Bock beer and sing and play my guitar and make up songs as I go along and maybe I'll take up smoking cheap cigarettes because, hell, it just fits the fantasy.  Yeah, and on that porch I'll have those good old white molded plastic chairs and a few cactus plants and a few Christmas lights, and maybe a Hibachi grill.  I'll sit out there all night singing to the neighbors until I pass out.  Oh, and one more thing, I need to find one of those plastic blow up girls to keep me company while I drink and smoke and play guitar, so if you know where I can get one, let me know.   And please, if you know me, don't try to convince me otherwise because this is my fantasy and not yours.  That's the kind of mood I'm in.   I wish I was anyone but me right now.  Not really gonna make a big deal about it.  I'm a big boy and I can swallow my pride just like everyone else.

      One afternoon at Cheers, Cliff Clavin was explaining the Buffalo Theory to his buddy Norm. And here's how it went:  "Well ya see Norm, it's like this...A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. When the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members."  "In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we all know, kills brain cells, but, naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells, first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine."  "That's why you always feel smarter after a few beers."

      The thing that truly bugs me about life is its steady unpredictability.  I spent some time this weekend with a truly amazing woman. I've had one date with her and I'm ready to begin rethinking my all of my theories on love. Again.  It's amazing how a simple alteration in events can quickly change everything from your perceptions of life to those deep seeded emotional deficiencies that we all protect with such earnest resolve.  I am hooked on a relationship that is barely in its infancy; hell, it's barely even an embryo.  Yet here I am, reporting the news like anyone cares.  I find it so hard to stay focused on the primary objectives of the relationship.  I fell like I'm standing in a newly planted vegetable garden waiting for something to sprout up so that I can eat like everyone else. It's hard because I am so fascinated by this woman that I can barely go five minutes without thinking of her.  I hate that.  It makes me feel as though I am setting myself up for a huge let down.  But it's even worse trying to not think about her.    Affairs of the heart are always such desperate dances.  So much is involved in love that it's a wonder the word isn't harder to spell.  Love is deceivingly complex.  It seems so simple doesn't it?  I love you, you love me, we're a happy family...yada yada yada.  Love is a lot like this Movado watch I have here on my wrist.  It looks so elegant with its minimalist black face and its perfectly simple minute and hour hands.  From what I can see on the surface, my watch is simple.  Two things exist together for a clearer purpose.  But what, I dare ask, makes those watch hands work in such effortless harmony?    Well, I can tell you right now, I'm not about to open up the watch and find out.  I've seen firsthand the inner workings of a watch just like I've seen the inner workings of love.  Both are terribly complicated devices and are best left to those who have lots and lots of experience in building and repairing the components and mechanisms involved.  I don't know a damn thing about watches.  And to tell you the truth, I'm not so sure I know a damn thing about love either.    But who the heck cares right?  No way to learn the dance without doing it right?  Right.  So, that said, I'd like to cast my vote for patience as the most valuable attribute ever.  If they never invent a way to tell the future before it happens, I think I can be satisfied that patience is the next best thing.  I wish I was a fortune teller and I could just slap down a couple of tarot cards and know how it was going to be. But I'm not, so I'm forced to deal with all this new love and excitement in baby steps- and excruciating baby steps at that.  I need a bumper sticker that says "Hurry up and get here already".  But, from what I can see- what I have found to be true (no matter how much I despise it)- is that the best things in life are the ones that are the hardest to achieve; those things that require you to be patient, the ones that you have to wait around for until you're blue in the face.   If anyone needs me, I'll be down the road. Yeah, I'll be standing in my newly planted love garden watching anxiously for sprouts.

      The following is a satirical commentary on the state of song writing in Nashville.  Dear Mom,                  I hope everything is well with you.  I can't complain.            Can you loan me twenty two hundred dollars for my songwriter's guild fees this month?  I know I borrowed from you last month and have yet to pay you back, but I feel like I'm going to have a hit on my hands this month.  I'm in very good sprits this month because I just finished up a song called "I Love You All the Time".  This is one of my finest songs.  I know I've said that before, so I've decided to include a few lyrics to appease your skepticism.  It goes like this:      [electric guitar]  whaaaaaa,  whaaaaaa, whaaaaaa                   [obligatory fiddling sounds] wee wee wee we   [some slow drums]  bah, bah, bum, bah bah bum bum                   Girl sometimes I feel like I'm flying,                 Whenever I get to crying,                 Because you don't know how much I love your smile,                 Even though we fight each other,                 I still love my brother,                 And my mother,                 And my father died last year...   [electric guitar] wha wha wha whaaaaaa            CHORUS: If you ever think,                 You are about to sink,                 In a pool of tears,                 Remember my face,                 It will erase all your fears,                 Because you know I love you all the time                 Yeah Yeah all the time   [obligatory ooo-oooing in the background]  [synthesized steel guitar sounds] waaaailll weeeeil wahwah  [some more drums] bah bah bah bum bum  [short fiddling sounds]wee wee weeee we  [electric guitar harrasment] dah dah duh dah duh wha wha                 So there you have it Mom.  Its  bloody  brilliant isn't it? I've been brushing up on my British colloquialisms to impress Simon Cowell next month at the "AI" auditions (that's industry speak for "American Idol").            So far my agent says that Shania Twain rejected it because it didn't make her feel enough like a woman and because apparently it was too original.  But on the bright side, I have had an offer from both Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney.  Shaun (my agent) led me to believe that Tim would like to cut a duet with Faith as long as I didn't mind him changing some of the lyrics to better suit his voice and that Kenny is looking into possibly dueting with either Lenny Kravitz or Wyclef Jean.  Isn't that great?  So, as you can see  Mother , your son is well on his way to making a paycheck this month.  Mom, I'm so close I can almost touch the gold record.           By the way, don't worry about getting the money back.  I'll soon be making my weight in commissions.  The king's birthday is coming up and there are certain "monetary advantages" to working 12-hour shifts at the Waffle House across the street from Graceland.          Tell everyone I'm almost a star and that I'll soon be changing the face of country music as we know it.    Love always,  Carl  P.S.  I know Dad is still a little upset that I am doing what I'm doing.  Please try to convince him that his financial and emotional support through 7 years of med school and the three years of residency meant the world to me, but what I really need now is his support of my music.

      Tonight I am restless.  I have already walked from my room to the living room seven times.  From the living room I walked through the garage to my truck where I then proceeded to drive to the nearest bookstore in an attempt at calming my nerves.  It didn't help.  Prepare yourself for the worst because I am now restless in front of a dimly lit monitor.  I am not tired.  I am comfortable and I have an ice cold beer in front of me, which means that shortly I will not only be restless but I will be slightly more sedate.  You may think this is not altogether a good state to be in and I can assure you that it is not.  Nascar has never known a race the likes of what is going on in my head right now.  I get these attacks about two times a month.  I call them anxiety attacks although I'm not sure if that is truly what they are.  Regardless, this blog is a new form of therapy I am all too willing to test.    I walk around bookstores when I am restless.  I do this for a couple reasons.  One reason is because I can sometimes find a focus amongst all the book titles and that helps to ease my mind.  Another reason is because bookstores always have a healthy amount of background chatter that I can eavesdrop on and therefore restrain the multitude of thoughts already swirling about in my own head.  The last reason, one that I should probably be embarassed about but am not, is that a bookstore is a good public hangout for beautiful intelligent women.  They feel safe there I think.  They can sip their latte and curl up on some couch with a good book.  There is no reason for them to look their best, no pressure to perform and no expectations that they be chipper.  I like this about bookstores.  It makes stalking the women that much easier.    Yes, stalking is very easy in bookstores.  I see a really beautiful woman, I follow her casually as if I am looking for a book.  If she looks up, I look down as if I'm deep in thought over some marvelous conjecture this new piece of literature has brought to me.  Do I feel weird about stalking in the bookstore?  No.  Should I?  I don't think so.     sipping beer   I'm not stalking like celebrity stalking.  In fact, maybe stalking is not the word I should use.  Maybe I'm just admiring.  Yes, that's a much less scary word and it really does describe more of what I'm actually doing.  Yes, the bookstore does all of those things for me.  But tonight it did nothing so here I sit.  My fingers are going ninety miles an hour and my brain is lapping them four times.  Some of the random thoughts I'm having (or are they having me?): my leg hurts, why does my leg hurt?  I cannot possibly go to bed before 11 pm tonight, when am I going to finally start my career?, I wish I could find that monkey picture that guy had, how can I improve my sense of balance?  my face feels greasy, my mom and dad go to bed too early    burp    That burp didn't taste anything like my dinner -strange.  Focus, focus....the darkness is very comfortable to me.   sipping beer     I think I like being alone more than being with people and I think that really worries me.  I don't desire to find comfort in solitude, but it comes very naturally and I unknowingly welcome it with open arms.  The only problem I have with solitude is that it gives me more time to explore my own mind and my own personality.  The more I do that, the more I am concerned that I am not paying enough attention to some aspect of me that I should be.  I always feel as though I am forced (by my passions) to wear too many hats; I have too many interests and too many raw talents.  I'm no braggart, I'm simply recording this for my own therapeutic reasons.  I feel like I'm trying to write a two sentence summary of world history-I can't decide which important parts to focus on.  So that's really why I think I get these anxiety attacks.  Its because I have too much stuff going on in my head at any one time.  I thought maybe I had ADHD/ADD, but I can certainly focus for prolonged periods of time when I need to.  Maybe I expect too much from myself.  Maybe I should just focus on one talent or on one interest and neglect all the others for a time.  Maybe what I need is better scheduling in my life.     sipping beer   Bleh...no.  I hate scheduling my free time.  It drives me nuts.  I'm afraid I'll turn into one of those self-righteous people who always carry their leather clad daily planner every where they go and cannot give you a definitive yes or no answer without first consulting their master plan.  No thanks, I'll live with the anxiety attacks before I submit to the will of a leather bound daily dominatrix (the planner, I mean).  But then again, life is all about mastering those things we feel least comfortable with.  Maybe I need to spend more time pondering the consequences of a little more scheduling in my life.  If anyone has any advice for me, I'd love to hear it.  Yes, share with Nate some morsels of wisdom.    sipping beer

      I am beginning to believe that some people never do reach adulthood as it is meant to be.  Don't get me wrong, I am not choosing to publicly douse anyone's way of life in gasoline and then strike a match.  But what I am looking to touch on is the rampant unfamiliarity some of my "adult" acquaintances have with responsibility. And in more specific terms (at least in this post), those responsibilities associated with raising children.   I have just spent 1/4 of my month (that's 1 week for you non-math folks) with two of the biggest 10 year old hellions I have ever had the unfortunate pleasure of sharing a public space with.  My problem is not with the kids though.  Yes, they were absolute brats who didn't know the difference between right and wrong, but that's not their fault entirely.  After my hell-week I can honestly say that there ought to be a tax funded position created by Congress – it might be called "Supreme Natural Selector"- or something less catchy like "Idiot Assassin" .  The position would involve policing the gene pool in America.    Yeah, I think it's a great idea.  And if there were ever a lobby group for it, I’d be its gung-ho leader.  I'm sure other countries, if given a chance, would adopt the position as well.  Basically, it involves this: if you do not have a high enough thought capacity to be socially responsible, then you should be castrated.  No breeding for you. Period.  They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  I only wish some of these parents were apples.  Some are more like boulders with eyebrows.  And the boulder tree in America is just gigantic.    I hate to be so pessimistic, but it saddens me when two parents cannot find it in their natural institution to raise a child to be, at the very least, socially responsible.  I am not asking for great miracles here, I'm simply asking for parents to raise their children to know the differences between right and wrong.  I don't care if the parents raise the next Albert Einstein or not, all I care is that someone has respect for those around them and their property too.  The thing that needs to be taught is that children (as cliché as it sounds) are the future.  And if you don't teach them to be socially responsible, they never will be of their own accord. I feel like if we could somehow just take an ax to the tree that bears all this rotten fruit, then we could solve the problem.    I'm not sure realistically how we are going to do this, but I think mandatory IQ testing for parents is a good first step.  Seriously; if a couple's combined IQ is not 190 or higher, they can't have children.  The natural and national results of this policy would be staggering.  Now, I know you are probably saying that I can't just castrate people for not being good at standardized tests.  You're correct, I can't.  That's why there should also be a borderline parental mentoring program in place so that if a couple should happen to fail the IQ tests, they still have the opportunity to redeem themselves.    And while we're at it, lets just throw in a responsible fireworks course too...     Note: Barring all miracles, I know that this policy can never happen.  The real lesson here is that it is good to dream of such unreachable things.  It is good to hope for things and to try to dream up ways to make them happen.  Sort of like me dreaming about hot beer girl [see:  Forging the Courage to Say Something ].

      Wrote this one a few months ago, hope you like it.     Seaworthy          A thousand lives I could have, Yet only one for me to live, Potential bound only by my perception, No stars, no charts, no defined direction.  I cast away from familiar harbors, Facing uncertainty in foreign waters,  I am the crew, I am the sail,  By what force will I prevail?  My mind is the captain, My soul the ship, My heart the rudder, My life the trip.  The world is an ocean on which I sail, The waves are the chances I have to fail, Each one I conquer, each time I rise, I see the next one with salty eyes.  Through strife and struggle and cleansing rains, The squalls of love and the gales of change, My vessel holds steady to its destined course, My soul my ship, my dreams its force.

      Ok, I'm not about to attempt to put my love life on the Internet, but I thought I could share some thoughts that might make for a different perspective for some folks who may be reading.    Now that the disclaimer is over, let me tell you about this girl.  The girl in question is a really hot beer girl at a local bar that I attend.  I'd always seen her when I'd go up to get a beer but I was only recently introduced to her through a friend.  She is one of those people that, upon meeting, I literally felt like I had known for my entire life.  She is a bit younger than me (she's 21 to my 25), but she took an active role in the conversation we were having.  So much so that I found myself convinced that she was actually interested in what I had to say.  Now, some of you reading this may know me personally and you all know that I am terribly picky when it comes to most women and especially bar girls.  I actually prefer the term "bar whores", but let's not be crude in a public forum (oops, too late).    Anyway, the conversation was great and then it concluded.  But I walked away from this beer girl with a bit of a crush.  I felt so manipulated and I still do.  I felt, well, I felt slightly irritated that in all of my fastidiousness, and after all my careful emotional protectionist measures, I had absolutely zero defense for that deadly combination of youthful beauty (oooh, her skin is so soft and tight and porcelain-like) and infectious personality (I bought all of my buddies beer just to talk to her some more) that this young lady unknowingly exhibited (or was it unknowingly?).  Regardless of her intentions, be they noble or evil, I now have a ridiculous school boy type crush on this beer girl.  I am intelligent. I have a college degree and sometimes I can even reflect back on my past mistakes and learn from them.    Where have I gone wrong in this whole thing?    After several days of ponderance, I have come to the conclusion that I am in fact, completely powerless against natural urges.  And because of that particular quality (curse the Heavens) I am now making a plan to steal the beautiful beer goddess away from her unsuspecting boyfriend so that I may have her for myself. Does that sound selfish?  Probably so but who cares?  It's not like I know the guy.  Here is where I need any amount of input from anyone reading.  I have worked up a theory on courage.  I'm a shy sort of guy so I have to work towards saying something to her besides "Coors Light please".  Here is my theory.  And just a bit of warning, I wrote it earlier this week and it sounds a bit philosophical. Just pretend like I'm a Budhist priest dealing out advice to young grasshoppa.                               NATE'S PHILOSOPHICAL COURAGE THEORY    The thing about courage, the thing I must keep reminding myself, is that courage is not innate.  It is not a genetic trait, nor is it an occurence of the fates; Courage, that is to say, does not happen at random or at preordained moments defined by the Gods.  I say that courage is born from a desire- an earnest desire- and from a rational choice proposed by emotions.   If a man is said to have great courage, it is my belief that this man has met his emotions head on and unwielding as a sledge meets hot iron upon a forge.  A courageous man shapes his emotions into something useful; a tool of some sort.  When the moment arises, the man takes up this tool and strikes down those obstacles that keep him from his desires.  So it is easy to assert that courage may be both learned and forgotten throughout a man's life.  Each day provides a man time at the forge and each day there is a chance for his desires to be left unfulfilled.  Depending upon his success or failure at the forge, a man's emotions - his courage- may be left sharpened or dulled.  If you have any good ideas about how to go about forging my courage to steal the beer girl away, let me know. In the mean time I'll be hard at work on a follow up line to "Coors Light please".

      I thought I'd add a few of my favorite poems to the blog. There will be more later.           The Second Coming   Turning and turning in the widening gyre  The falcon cannot hear the falconer;  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,  The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  The ceremony of innocence is drowned;  The best lack all convictions, while the worst  Are full of passionate intensity.   Surely some revelation is at hand;  Surely the Second Coming is at hand.  The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out  When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi  Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert  A shape with lion body and the head of a man,  A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,  Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it  Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.  The darkness drops again; but now I know  That twenty centuries of stony sleep  Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,  And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,  Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?     - W.B. Yeats    	 Invictus   Out of the night that covers me,  Black as the Pit from pole to pole,  I thank whatever gods may be  For my unconquerable soul.   In the fell clutch of circumstance  I have not winced nor cried aloud.  Under the bludgeonings of chance  My head is bloody, but unbowed.   Beyond this place of wrath and tears  Looms but the horror of the shade,  And yet the menace of the years  Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.   It matters not how strait the gate,  How charged with punishments the scroll,  I am the master of my fate;  I am the captain of my soul.    - William Earnest Henley    	 IF   If you can keep your head when all about you  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  But make allowance for their doubting too;  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,  Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;   If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;  If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;  If you can meet with triumph and disaster  And treat those two imposters just the same;  If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,  And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools;   If you can make one heap of all your winnings  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  And lose, and start again at your beginnings  And never breath a word about your loss;  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  To serve your turn long after they are gone,  And so hold on when there is nothing in you  Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on";   If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch;  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;  If all men count with you, but none too much;  If you can fill the unforgiving minute  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run -  Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,  And - which is more - you'll be a Man my son!     - Rudyard Kipling

      My brain already hurts from trying to think of an appropriate title for my Blog.  I wanted a good title to capture the way I feel about life.  I guess I accomplished that.  I didn't want it to sound too cynical, so if it does, I apologize for not being the eternal optimist. But I do think it does a good job of describing my perceptions of life.  I doubt anyone will ever read this anyway, so more than likely I'm just talking to myself.  But in case anyone does read the stuff I'm going to post here, I want you to know upfront what you can expect.  This is a blog about nothing in particular.  I guess I could have called it "Seinfeld Blog" but that would have been boring and subject to copyright laws (maybe, I'm not sure).    The point of this blog- the whole reason for its existence- is for me to have a place to write down all the crazy stuff that I think up on a daily basis.  Most of the stuff you'll inevitably find here is what I'd call a positive pancake with a side of cynical syrup.  I have found out that I am equally good at inspiring myself as I am uninspiring myself, but the results are always one of two things: 1) completely profound or 2) completely useless. I've tried writing it all down in a book before but then I end up carrying around a book and I can hardly stand to carry around something I'm not sure I am going to use.  Sort of like walking a dog that is not even yours.  And just as a disclaimer, I'm really not into political or religious bashing of any sort so don't worry, there'll be none of that here.  Anyway, who knows how often I will update this sucker.  Maybe every day, maybe just once a month.  Hopefully, one day I'll be able to say something beneficial to the world.  And hopefully, when I say it, there will be someone listening...or reading.  Also, I may include a link that I think is funny or useful with each post- there is a lot of strange stuff on the Internet and some of it is just too damn good to not share.

      I'm no Rhett Butler, but this weekend I was almost gone with the wind.  Hurricane Charley hit Florida with a force like I've never witnessed in my whole life.    My Mom and Dad and I were all holed up together in my bathroom on Friday night (August 13,2004).  We picked my bathroom because it has no windows and because the last time my Dad and I remodeled it, we added 2 inches of concrete reinforcement to the wall which backs up to the facade of the house.    The experience was interesting to say the least.  We had a battery powered Coleman "King Cobra" camping TV on the bathroom counter and we had pillows everywhere.  I alos had my laptop in case we wanted to watch a movie, but as it turns out the storm was only really vicious for about an hour or so.  Since I am so tall I had to sit on the floor straddling my legs around each side of the toilet.  That was an akward position, let me tell you; I'm glad the roof didn't collapse in on me because the search crews would have had a hell of a time trying to figure out what I was doing straddling the toilet.  We had power for the better part of the evening, but once the eye was directly over us we lost power almost immediately.  I am sure that I'll remember that night for the rest of my life.  I already remember a few things: there was that insane howling sound when the winds started to get around 100 mph (I could hear the wind through my bathroom fan pipe), how nervous my Mom was, and how Dad and I both seemed as though we'd rather be playing outside in the high winds.  The only reason I say that is because Dad kept going to the windows and both of us kept opening the front door in the middle of the storm. But alot of the door opening was because the wind felt so cool and also because there was a tremendous scent in the air.  I guess it had to do with sickening amount of trees that had already been uprooted and dismantled at that point.  Still the smell was something I will remember forever- it was like a really good pine car freshener.   As a sidenote, I had a really profound experience the first time I opened my front door and saw firsthand the unbelievable power of nature.  Huge trees were being bent over like blades of grass and masses of branches were being sheared and sent flying through the air at breakneak angles and speeds.  As soon as I stepped onto the front porch I could feel the wind beat my body and try to push me around and I could see the wind changing directions instantly and without any real assemblance of order.  There was a howling noise and for a moment I felt as though I were standing in God's presence.  It was one of those feelings I'll never forget- a bit like having your first kiss on the loop-de-loop of a rollercoaster.  The storm itself was outright insane.  The day after was even more insane.  Saturday morning I woke up early to the sound of chainsaws and hammering on roof.  I guess God always finds a way to wake me up doesn't he?  Anyway, I'll post some pictures of the massive destruction on my street and around the neighboring areas.  Like I said before, the eye of the hurricane went directly over the top of my house so there is a ton of destruction.  Mostly the destruction is large uprooted oak trees that have fallen on roofs around the neighborhood and such, but there is also the occasional collapsed awning and I even saw a couple of shopping center signs that were obliterated.    The amazing things I learned the weekend are as follows. First, when a hurricane comes to town the first 3 things you must have are: a generator, a chainsaw, and plenty of water.  Also, although I am capable of many things, I am completely vulnerable to the fates in this world.  I could have died this weekend so easily.  My house could have been destroyed or my family taken from me and I would not have been able to do a damn thing about that.  I guess seeing the power of nature made me realize just how important it is to make everyday into something significant.  I love my friends and I love my family- those are the things that truly matter to me.  And just for the record, don't ever give up on the goodness of the human spirit.  I've always been fascinated at our ability to perservere through hard times and how we all lean on each other for support.  I found it to be quite moving when I returned home to my house on Sunday morning and found that my parents and several of my neighbors had all joined together to help my neighbor across the street whose house had been badly damaged by a fallen tree.  The sense of community was very comforting and indeed, very moving.  I only wish it didn't take something so tragic to bring it out in everyone.  Ahh but such is life.    All in all the weekend was a tremendous life experience.  I also made several important steps in my own personal life and I can't wait to share them.  But for now, I've got to sign off as I need to get some rest.  I will try to post some pictures of the devastation a bit later.

      Sometimes you just have to appreciate the moment for what it is and not look into the possibilities for the future.    I found that it sometimes hurts alot to do so, but in the end the moment is what keeps you going; it's the only thing that keeps your hopes alive.

      When my feet feel the floor my mind goes blank and my soul takes over.  I feel really close to God when I dance; almost like he is there with me.  I am no painter, but if my boots were brushes, I'd have ten thousand masterpieces laid out on the dance floors of dancehalls from Texas to Florida and even a few in Washington state. And when my feet hit the floor, I never know where the next stroke is going to go.   I can think of nothing more internally satisfying to me than beat of a good song. Especially a good quick two step or a swing.  There is a gratifying precision to the steps and the movements and when it all goes right it feels like the world is in perfect synch.   When my feet feel the floor the music becomes a part of me and the rhythm becomes an artery, carrying life to my heart and soul.    Music is my life; it gives me hope when nothing else can.  When my feet feel the floor they move like ghosts.  So fast and so freely you cannot focus on the last place they left.    Sometimes I feel like energy lives inside those smooth wooden slats of the floor.  Like it is a great spike that shoots upwards into my brain and stabs my adrenaline and my endorphins and forces me to smile no matter how hard I try not to.  One day, my feet will no longer feel the floor and remember the steps.  My joints will scream louder and longer and the energy I once found rising inside of me will have been long gone and all I will have left is the memory of what the floor felt like when I was still young: those memories of smooth wood, of corn starch and talcum powder, of late night roadside dance lessons in the dirt or on the asphalt.  Those memories of dancing underneath stars so low you could bump your head on them.  And of course the ones where I danced the night away with many a young lady underneath the fuzzy glow of neon lights. Sunday mornings never had anything on Satuday nights.   Then, as I pass from the world, I should hope that Heaven has nice floors.
