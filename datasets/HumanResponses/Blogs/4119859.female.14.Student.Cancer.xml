      The Olympics are Not Pointless they bring so much to one community, they share inspiration to people. The Olympics bring so much out of the athletes who would not have been considered medal hopes eg Sarah Carrigan winning gold in the Womens Road Race! The Olympics give different cultures and countrys to mix and put polictical differences a side. "Just ask one of the thousand of athletes in them, and the millions of children trying to be like them. The Olympics gives people something to strive for. " Qouted Ben Smith Blog, I think this statement by Monkey Man is quite true and I also think lots of children learn alot from the Olympics. Olympics Forever! Bec

      Friday was an interesting day got me feeling down a bit and I dont know what to say!!! Saturday I rode 10 ks today I also had under 14 and under 16 training very tiring! Last night I woke up at 330 to watch the opening ceremony I love the olympics! The Opening Ceremony wasnt as good as Sydney I think personally maybe cause I am Biased! Today when I got home I watched the Olympics and Now I still havent turned them off I love the road race! Im going to bed soon but I will be waking up at 230 to watch Ian thorpe swim and 4x100m Womens Freestyle Relay Go Libby, Henry, Pocket Rocket and Ryan your all awersome! Tommorrow the waterpolo starts Im really excited the women have a really good chance! Not many people no this but I absolutly love the cycling!! Especially the Track! I could never do it if I tried but I also like the gymnastics their all so flexiable ( Im so Jealous!) My dream is to compete in the OLympic Games one day Ill keep trying but I dont think it will ever happen! Have a good Weekend everyone! Lv Bec   Sunday: Today I went to waterpolo training saw barbara. About 230 this morning I woke up and I watched Ian Thorpe win ( I would have rather hackett won!) the I saw the most amazing thing the Australian Girls win the 4x100m relay. They Broke the world record and won Gold! It wasnt just theyre swim which amazed me it was theyre reactions Pocket Rocket Alice MIlls was so Happy she was Crying!!! How amazing I also saw the Australian softballers beat the number 2 ranked team! The divers before these olympics Australia had only won 3 Olympic Medals after one we had Now won 5. Robert Helm and Robert Newbery (world champions)won bronze in the 10m sycronzied dive they were expected to win gold but bronze is still awersome! Chantelle Newbury ( Roberts Wife) and Irena Lasco also won bronze in the scronized 3m diving. THis awersome both being mothers and its just an achievement! This afternoon in exactly 7 minutes I will be watching day 2 of the olympics! Ciao Lv Bec Ps What did you guys think of the uniforms! By the way waterpolo is on today yay! Go AUsTRALIA!

Last night mum said she wouldnt wake me up but she did I saw the Australian Gymnastics Girls for the first time in olympic history get into the top 8 final teams, then I saw petria Thomas win her 100m Butterfly what a legend coming back from 3 shoulder reconstructions! Then I watched the 4x100m mens relay team swim they were shit and I believe Ian Thorpe isnt as fast as he used to be! In the afternoon I watched Australian mens hockey and waterpolo teams have easy wins! Tonight the famous 200m will be swam go hackett!!!! Have a good day love bec Ps Womens waterpolo starts tonight!!!! Ill be watching   Tuesday I  think im suffering of over watching Olympics!! Im tired and Grumpy! Well the girls won there first game of waterpolo last night defeating Italy 6-5! Ian Thorpe won even though I didnt think he would! The divers won bronze again and Leisel was disapointting getting BronZE! But the most amazing is brooke Hansen winning Silver in 100m breastroke agter not making the Olympics in Sydney and thinking of retiring she came strong with the most amazing Silver Medal Of the Games!
