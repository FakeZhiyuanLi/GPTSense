      i got this in a email a while ago and thought it was good. LIFE AND A CAN OF BEER When things in your life seem almost to much to handle, when 24 hours in a day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise jar........and the beer. A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and emptymayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golfballs. He then asked the students if the jar was full.They agreed that it was. So the professor then pickedup a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. Heshook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into theopen areas between the golf balls. He then asked thestudents again if the jar was full.They agreed it was.The professor next picked up a box of sand and pouredit into the jar. Of course, the sand filled upeverything else. He asked once more if the jar wasfull. The students responded with an unanimous "yes."The professor then produced two cans of beer fromunder the table and poured the entire contents intothe jar, effectively filling the empty space betweenthe sand. The students laughed."Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, "I want you to recognize that this jar represents yourlife. The golf balls are the important things--yourfamily, your children, your health, your friends, yourfavorite passions--things that if everything else waslost and only they remained, your life would still befull. "The pebbles are the other things that matterlike your job, your house, your car. The sand iseverything else--the small stuff.If you put the sand into the jar first," he continued,"there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls.The same goes for life. If you spend all your time andenergy on the small stuff, you will never have roomfor the things that are important to you. Payattention to the things that are critical to yourhappiness. Play with your children. Take time to getmedical checkups. Take your partner out to dinner.Play another 18. There will always be time to cleanthe house, and fix the disposal. "Take care of thegolf balls first, the things that really matter. Setyour priorities. The rest is just sand."One of the students raised her hand and inquired whatthe beer represented. The professor smiled. "I'm gladyou asked. It just goes to show you that no matter howfull your life may seem, there's always room for acouple of beers.
