          &nbsp;   Fairy Tale Love      By Matthew&nbsp;"Anonymous"      I thought my search would go on forever,  My hunger for love never able to satiate.  But all of this had changed  In the early morning of twenty eight.   It was as though I was given  A message from above,  Directing me to someone  Who can handle all my love.   Seeing&nbsp;your gorgeous smile,  My insides are brought to life.  And when I hear&nbsp;your voice in evening,  This day worth all its hours of strife.   Connecting with you, I feel&nbsp;your vibes  And hopefully mine are just as strong.  If things between us remain the same,  I canâ€™t see anything ever going wrong.   A romantic future awaits both you and I,  A relationship filled with love and bliss.  It seemed a dream before knowing you,  But now I know fairy tale love does indeed exist.

         Well... I was born on December 31st, 1986 at 5:38 P.M. I was 9lbs. 9oz. and 20-some-odd inches long in Meriden, CT. I was a big baby, so i was born c-section; yeah, I guess my mother cheated her taxes a bit with the c-section and my birthday and all. *shrugs* I lived the first three and a half years in an apartment in Middletown, CT. In the April of 1990, we moved to Durham and stayed with my father's parents until September. In September, we moved into a house up the street. It was green and part of it was 200 years old with an addition that was 100 years old. The day after Christmas that year, my brother was born, outweighing me from when I was born. He was obviously also a c-section baby. What was  my  reaction to him coming into the world? Well, my first words I ever spoke to him were "You ruined my life"... or so I'm told.    My best friend, Danielle, and I would always play together when we were little. Her parents are my Godparents, so their parents and mine are best friends, too. She, her little sister, my little brother, and I would play McDonald's, bank, house, flashlight tag, endless hours of Super NES, a few hours of NES, and we would dance to the radio, we'd go to the beach and make forts by digging massive holes in the sand. Since we both work at my mom's restaurant, we're still able to talk hang out when things are slow... but other than that, we don't do much together anymore. When I was ten, i was brought to see a psychologist/psychiatrist (I know the difference between them; but I don't remember which one she was). It turns out that I had OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) in the fourth grade with intrusive thoughts, causing me to think that I hated my mother. This took it's toll on me and on her. Can you imagine your son constantly telling you that he thinks he hates you? I didn't mean it, but when the chemical balance is that far off when you're only ten years old, you really don't know what to think. You just cry. I wasn't popular until seventh grade. By the middle of eight grade, I was the most popular kid in school. I was so outgoing... I'd start dancing in front of the entire school when school dances were held. Everyone would make a big circle around me and cheer me on and congradulate me on my outgoing dancing performances. After eighth grade, I transferred to a private Catholic high school- Xavier High School. For the first month or two, everyone would say hi to me, calling to me with my famous nickname, Big Red. I'd wave or give a thumbs up as if to say 'hey'. But after those few months... I was miserable until my sophmore year. Late in the summer between freshman and sophmore year, I met a girl whom I dated for a while. We remained friends afterward though and we still sorta have fun nowadays, which I'll explain later. Sophmore year I made a couple of good friends, whome I became close with. However, due to reasons which will not be mentioned here, we are no longer friends. The summer between sophmore and junior year was incredible. I was hanging out with my friend from the previous summer, and I went to a concert that has changed my style and music ever since... the Radio 104 Fest. Evanescence was awesome and they were the main reason why I wanted to go. I made some friends that summer, that loved me for who I was and not what I looked like or what I wore. (come to find out somewhat recently, my friend from the summer prior to this, has told me that she didn't like the the big pants I wear, the spiked bracelets I wear, my eyeliner or my spikey hair!) Now mind you she has gone down the same road before with the gothic clothing, but I'm not like her. I'm not violent like her. And as violent as she is, she still puts such a high priority on the Catholic religion! During junior year, I was telling more and more people that I was gay... Until I told the wrong person. We weren't friends really, but I was probably looking for a little bit of attention, so I told him. He told other people and soon pretty much the entire school knew... only the kids to don't here much gossip don't know that I'm gay. In fact, many of my classmates are still skeptical because I'm so straight-acting. They think I do it JUST for attention. Anyways... I go throutgh junior year without a single friend. To be honest, though, I don't believe that my sexual orientation had anything to do with it. Actually, I think that more people respected me for coming out. Towards the end of my junior year, I met a girl at a dance who shared my strong dislike for our corrupt government. I introduced her to my other friend who I met between the summer of freshman and sophmore year, since they were both very much into anime. Unfortunately, they had ended up double teaming me because they are both very violent people at times, even when they are just playing around... plus a whole lot of other crap, too (a bit of which is previously mentioned). So from this, I make an attempt to hang out with a friend whom I met through a boy I dated for a couple weeks of my junior year. She has now started talking to my brother and they are dating. This friend is seventeen as am I. But don't forget that my brother and I are FOUR YEARS APART!! So now when she calls the house, it's not even to talk to me. In fact, one of the last times she called, she was talking to my brother; and I asked my brother who just called. He told me who called and I given a message from her from my brother.... "Hi." -_- yes... "Hi." So now I'm basically on a search for a friend considering that I don't really have any. That's all I have on the summery of life. Catch ya later, guyz :)

        Can life get any worse? I have no friends and the boy I liked, I scared off. *sighs* I absolutely hate my two "best friends". Just the other night, they were watching something about a half-hour long on Friend A's laptop. So I decided to log off friend B's screen name on yahoo because she wasn't using it and we needed to leave after they were finished what they were watching anyways. Friend B starts yelling at me and I try to defend my position on doing that with the reasons just mentioned when Friend A defends Friend B. I introduced them to each other. I am simply using them both to get things off of the internet, as of now. Then I will drop them like a rock. This is not the only reason why I am doing this. They both treat me inferior to each other as well as many other things. I hate them both and I plan on telling her homophobic, Catholic, republican, pro-life father that i am the opposite of all those things. I hate them both so much!!!
