      Random Happening in the life of Caroline this week... ...  Comedy of the week :  I have the sweetest little patient, older (the one who leaned in for a kiss last week).  He's not a dirty old man, just a man in bad circumstances who is affectionate... I was doing therapy with him and watching him intently to see how his swallowing was going and he looked at me for a long time and then said, "I could kiss you real nice baby."  ...  Blessing of the week :  Everyone is being so great about pulling me in and including me!  Everytime I turn around someone is inviting me somewhere to do something or helping me out in someway.  It is wonderful.  And it makes me feel smack dab in the middle of the Lord's will.  He is really taking care of me.  Another blessing- the Lord help set a tough relationship at work on the right path and things are looking up now.  ...  Entertainment of the week ... Has anyone else been watching the Olympics?  I am such a fan of the gymnastics, but I just have to ask, How in the world do they bend that way?  It is unphathomable to me!  They're just hanging out on a bar thinking, " Okay now I am just going to flip now and land on a 2x4 and then bend myself like a pretzel and flip in that position 30 times.  And don't forget to smile while doing it... No big deal, just an ordinary day ."  And my favorite is the announcers.  Forget that these people are doing the most seemingly impossible movements perfectly, the commentators have to ruin it by saying, " Oh her right eyelash went outside of the line, that's 1/10 point deduction.  Oh MY!  She just ruined that simple triple turn on a toe by tilting slightly to the left.  That's at lest 3/10s of a deduction.  Well she might as well go home... Yeah she nailed the balance beam but she moved 1/16 of an inch forward on that dismount with a triple tuck twist turnover tipsy turvey. "  What is up with those people anyway?  You know at they same time they are making those comments they are all 400 pounds and fighting over the last Krispy Kream.  And they think they have us fooled.  ...  Quote of the week:  Spoken by one of my patients that I won't let be lazy and skip out on therapy, "Why, you're just a little devil, aren't you?" ...  Memory of the week:   I forgot to mention my wierdest experience at the nursing home thus far.  One of my patient's decided to go see Jesus for a few minutes.  And guess who found her when she was checked out?  Yours truly, of course... Why not?  I was getting her tray ready for lunch and noticed she was really still and quite.  Said her name, no response.  Shook her, no response.  Felt her pulse, nothing.  So I hollered for help, and they called code blue and grabbed her wheelchair and tried to get her out of the dining room.  Unfortunately, the dining room is relatively small and there was a few residents blocking the path.  With no time to spare or to unlock the breaks on a wheelchair, I yanked one little lady's chair- breaks locked- out of the way.  She bobbed her head up and down and hollared out as if on a bumpy gravel road.  It's a good thing I didn't send her to Jesus too!  They took the patient to her room and tried to revive her and we all started shedding some tears.  When all the sudden she yelled, "Get off me!"  And she came back.  So I hope that I wasn't the one solely responsible for bringing her back from the arms of Jesus.  I guess she got board that day with the facility activities and decided to go see Jesus for awhile.

      Remember how I commented on the Lord's sense of humor before?  Well,  I have found yet another personal quirk that shows his cleverness.  The Lord gave me two contradicting traits... I have no athletic ability (or basic coordination required to walk in a straight line without running into a wall, for that matter) whatsoever.  I ran track in highschool, but my biggest reasoning was just to shape up and to stay in shape, and my goal of every track meet (no lie- I can't make this stuff up) was not to place or come in second, but my goal was to never be last.  Now I know that last sentance made several of you tilt your head in a patronistic way and say, "oh," but really, I am okay.  I was happy with that goal.   Do you ever go to the gym or the track and pick out that one person who is in shape and working out in perfect form and they smile at you and you smile back out of sheer politeness, all the while thinking, "Whatever you skinny butt, I hope you trip on that dumbell that I just tripped on."  I know I am not the only one who has ever thought this...  Well, I don't know if it's the Olympics in the air or what, but tonight was an especially competative night for me.   Unfortunately, it was a really bad coordination day as well.  I couldn't walk in a straight line.  My best friend Holly and I have been faithfully walking over the last few weeks (okay really just last week and this week but that sounded like we had been on it for at least 3 weeks solid).  Tonight was no different.  We ate dinner and then went out to the walking path behind her complex.  We were jaunting along, talking but still feeling like we were going at a good pace, when all of the sudden, out of NOWHERE, comes this big brazen girl who would have knocked us over if Holly and I hadn't have jumped off the path.   We watched her pass us and commented in disbelief at her pace.  I mean, seriously, it was insane.  This girl was not small.  Not fat, but not small.  The Lord built her large.  I guess I always thought smaller people could move faster than bigger people, but not in this case.  I really don't think I could have kept up with her if I was running.   So anyway we went back to our conversation before this upset and forgot about fast girl.  But then it happened.  Yes, for all of you who ran track (and weren't good), you know the ultimate goal of any track  meet is to not get lapped.  It is one thing to get lapped when you are running around a standard sized track.  But she LAPPED us WALKING around a track twice the size of a standard highschool track.  And we were not going slow!   Thus, this became the focus of the next 45 minutes of our walk.   Now, we weren't crazy.  We knew setting a goal to pass her was out of the question.  So our immediate goal was to not be lapped again.  It was every man for himself.  And as the walk progressed, we found ourselves getting more and more psycho about it, until the last lap, we realized she was close to lapping us for the second time.  So we joined forces (linked arms- not because we are cheesy- we really didn't realize we were doing it) and walked at the fastest speed imaginable just for the sheer satisfaction of not being lapped twice.  I was falling over because of the bad coordination day for me, and we both had to go to the bathroom which sped the pace up a little bit, but I am happy to report we made it without being lapped again.  Mission accomplished.

      Story of the day: I am seeing this little lady for therapy. (The same one that I tried to coax into doing therapy by praying with her and then getting onto her for talking during the prayer... She has come along way and I believe it is all because of that special prayer we had :)... I was doing some oral motor exercises to increase the strength, coordination, and range of motion of the muscles used for swallowing. Okay, that's the fancy terminology. Basically, we just make funny faces for 30 minutes... Stick your tongue out, pucker up (one 60 year old man leaned in for a kiss today- I think he misinterpreted the purpose of this exercise), smile big, make an "o" with your lips, open your mouth wide, etc... The other nursing home tech's always walk by and look at me as if I have lost my ever loving mind.  But back to this little lady... I told her to stick her tongue out. She looked at me astonished and said, "No!" I said, "Please stick your tongue out at me sweetie." And she said, "Why would I stick my tongue out at you? You haven't done anything to me." Ah... The logic of a 90 year old.

      I hope it is as beautiful there as it is here! It is so beautiful and all I can think about is fall, pumpkins, football, and flannel shirts! I love this weather! Tommorow it's supposed to be a high of 75! It's beginning to be my favorite time of year!  I had to share an experience I had at the nursing home before I began this website. I forgot to mention it before. I hesitated mentioning it, but it is too good to not share, and it prooves the fact that men will be men, whether 20, 30, or in this case, 80 plus.  I was seeing a man at the bedside to help him eat lunch, to see if he was choking, etc. He kept staring at my chest area and, niave me, just though that he was looking at my name tag (Girls- if a man stares at your chest- rest assure he's NEVER trying to read your nametag). But, me being gullable and niave, explained to him that my nametag said that I was indeed Caroline Martin, speech therapist. He shook his head and said, "No!" And then he proceeded to say something that was too unintelligable to make out. He had to keep repeating it because I couldn't understand what he was saying. I FINALLY understood when he yelled, "NO! Your boob (except he didn't say "boob"- this web site is g-rated and the word he DID say is one of my least favorite words in the world, for those of you who know me well). "Your boob! One of them's bigger than the other!" And then he looked at me as if CHALLANGING me to solve this problem. Maybe I should do some therapy with him about appropriateness in social situations. And FYI, my shirt was NOT too tight and would have easily stood up in the dresscode test at the UAMS clinic.   And for those of you who are curious, no they aren't uneven. They are symetrical and I would appreciate you not trying to see for yourself next time I run into you. :)

      Well, the Lord indeed answers prayers. I had a relatively normal day. -Work, got home, exercised, and then went to girls Bible study, which has been a wonderful blessing. After the Bible study I was headed over to Holly's to go walking and I casually prayed, "Lord, I don't know what I need to write on my website today so let me know what I should write about." Holly and I had been walking about 40 minutes at her complex and I heard my car alarm go off. So we headed back up to see what was going on and my car was gone. Of course, we went through the whole panic mode (okay, I went throught the whole panic mode- Holly was the steady calm hand beside me) and got the police on the phone, called Daddy, etc. I am reporting the incident when Holly calls the apartment complex and finds out it has been towed. Officer Joe informed her of this information, very excited to report his small part in fighting crime tonight by having my car towed because it was parked "6 feet from the curb." (It couldn't have been there more than 45 minutes, and regardless of what he says, was NOT blocking the 30 foot wide enterance to the complex.) Seriously, policeman exaggerate more than fisherman. All that aside, we were just relieved and thankful that it wasn't stolen.  You would think the story ends there, but oh no, the experience has just begun. She called the tow place and of course it was listed wrong in the phone book and information didn't have the number so we had to call our friend Officer Joe again. So we find out that they are open and where they are located (in the ghetto) and that it's not going to cost nearly what we expected, and then we collapsed on the couch in relief that it wasn't stolen as we waited for TJ to get home to go with us. And like any good friend, she got me a Dr. Pepper and an Oatmeal Cream Pie to relieve the tension and to contradict the walk we just went on. :)  In the mean time, I decide to take a shot in the dark and call my car insurance, which offers free towing, to see if they would cover it. (Sounds silly, but you NEVER know). They informed me that no, they did not cover your car being towed for a mistake in parking, but only if I have a break down. Can't hurt for asking.  We got to the tow place in the ghetto and walked in to a small room/office. The place was pretty shady. They asked for a liscence and I told them it was in the car, so they said we would have to go around back where my car was. I gave TJ a look that informed him that he would be accompaning me to the "back." The man unlocked the gate for me and told TJ that I had to go down into the lot to my car by myself. As I was walking down into this big, shady lot with several cars, he yelled very seriously, "DON'T WORRY! THERE AIN'T NOTHING DOWN THERE THAT WILL BITE YA, JUST A COW THAT LIKES TO ROAM AROUND!" So we ended up getting my car and when I was paying, I noticed the man was only using his left hand and was obviously right handed and his right arm was completely paralyzed. He informed me that "they said I had a stroke Sunday night, but I think I just got a pinched nerve from laying in that recliner right there." But it all worked out, my car wasn't stolen, and I refuse to complain about something when the Lord took care of me.  So the moral of this story: 1. Be careful what you ask for. The Lord may want to give you a more creative story than you intended. :) 2. Watch out for the roaming cattle. 3. Watch out for those recliners. They can give you a pinched nerve if you aren't careful.  God Bless... Caroline

      I promise that not every entry will be a top five or top ten list. However, this journal is also for my own records, and there are a few memories I would like to hang onto. Moving weekend back in May was so smooth. But there are always a few funny and tearful moments, so here are my top five:  1. Having Walkie Talkies on the way over. For those of you who dread your next family vacation that involves taking more than one car, may I suggest to you the endless possibilities of investing in a few Walkie Talkies (or borrowing the churches- whatever). It really does make the trip so much more exciting. EVEN though you have a cell phone that you can talk to that person in the car behind you, being able to say "roger that" and "loud and clear" adds a hint of excitement that no cell phone can accomplish. a 2. The Uhaul company in Searcy did not secure the truck size Daddy asked for. Instead, they booked a semi-sized truck that would easily have moved me and a family of 5 packrats. So here I am, pulling up in a Uhaul the size of a barn, and I am sure the neighbors are thinking the Clampets have indeed finally arrived to Nashville.  3. Upon exploring my apartment, I failed to notice that the glass door to my outside porch/deck area also had a screen door. I was storing something outside, and got excited about a story I was telling Nanga, Holly, and TJ on the other side; and literally RAN right into the screen (bent the frame and everything). Of course, I had my best friends to get me through it. They must have laughed for at least 30 minutes... :)  4. My sweet Father safety proofing, fire proofing, and Caroline proofing my entire apartment. One particular memory was Daddy wanting to put an extra latch on my door on top of the two dead bolts already in place. Mom and I both voiced the fact that we thought that the landlord might frown upon any drills being drilled into the wooden door frame and that two deadbolts ought to do it. But 30 minutes later, the drill was going, and now I lock that third latch as if my life depended on it. :)  5. That same sweet Daddy hugging me goodbye. We got a little choked up, said our goodbyes, he gave me the escape route for any natural disaster I should ever come across in Nashville, we finally felt ready to part :), and then we accidentallylocked his keys in his truck.

      God is such a provider.  I just feel so blessed today.  I have really felt that he has provided me with new friends just when the time was right.  I had time to get settled, and then people were reaching out to me right and left.  I know I would be happy if I had stayed in Searcy.  I know I would be happy if I had stayed in Little Rock.  I know this because I can be happy anywhere.  But I looked around tonight at the small group from the church I am a part of here in Nashville (about 40-50 young professional/singles) and I was overfilled with joy that the Lord had brought me to a place where there are so many of my peers here, -people in the same stage of life that I am.  I love my Cloverdale home congregation, but the Lord had put it on my heart to branch out and I am so glad I listened.  Because though he can bless us anywhere, he has blessed me in that special and unique way here that isn't necessarily in every city (a large group of young professionals/singles who are normal :).  I don't know why his blessings surprise me... He has never failed to take care of me.

      I feel like I am having to play a little catch up in this journal. I have already experienced so much that I want to share. As most of you know, I am currently a speech therapist in a nursing home facility. Now, you don't have to make any confession, but I am positive I am not the only one who avoided "nursing home visits" with the church youth group growing up. For some reason, it was never a ministry opportunity most of us looked forward to (Sharing the gospel in line at Six Flags over Dallas, on the other hand- I was all over that). When I told one of my dear friends that I was working in a nursing home, the first thing she asked was "Does it smell bad?" So funny, and so true, because that was one of the major things I was worried about when I was about to step into that facility for the first time (and just to clear the curiosity- no, it doesn't smell).  But, as in any ministry opportunity, we usually go in thinking we are gone save the world and the world usually ends up saving us. This case is no exception. I have learned so many valuable life lessons working in the nursing home thus far. Some funny, some endearing, but none the less all worthy of passing on. Here are the top ten things I have learned from being in a nursing home on a day to day basis:  1. It's the little things that make a big smile. I walked through the dining room and there was a man sitting at the table. Now you have to envision this man. I think he has always been special because of his facial features, and he has the biggest ears you have ever seen. He is very cartoon like. But this day he had the biggest smile on his face, because in the middle of July, he had found a black paper top hat that said, "Happy New Year." He looked like he had just won the lottery. 2. No matter how old you get and what quits working properly, you always have Bingo. I was doing therapy and my patient said, "IT'S TIME FOR BINGO!!!!" She looked panicked, so we had to adjourn the session and pick up after Bingo was over. 3. It is perfectly acceptable to tell someone "I love you" even if you've only seen their face in the hallway everyday, met them for 15 minutes, or just helped them sit up in bed one time. In fact, it's rude not to. 4. Road rage does exist in nursing home hallways with wheelchair's. I tried to pass one little lady while I was pushing my patient to therapy. The driver got perturbed and waved her fist in the air at me and mouthed at me. I think she was about to flip me off, but I assured her we were merely trying to pass her and not run her over. 5. Wheelchair's can be dangerous tools. One lady used her electric power wheelchair to bump into the facility bird cage, setting several birds loose all over the home. 6. You never know where a person has been or what they've accomplished. When hearing I was from Arkansas, one of my patients said, "Oh, the best friend I ever had was from Arkansas." Just to make conversation, I asked who it was. His reply? Sam Walton. I confirmed it with his family and it is true. And he helped Mr. Walton start the whole Walmart business. 7. No matter how old you get, you are never above a good catfight. I recently had to separate two ladies from a swinging match. One was demented, one wasn't, but the excitement of a good fight was there all the same! 8. Always watch your back. I was doing paperwork at my desk and all of the sudden I heard the sound of chopping teeth about 5 inches from my shoulders. If I hadn't of turned around, one of the residents was about to take a bite out of crime. 9. Families of people in nursing homes crave support. You do not have to know someone long to be a source of comfort. And you can only know someone for less than a week and still need to cry with them for thirty minutes when they are loosing their loved one. 10. God is always a good motivator. One little lady always said that the good Lord was going to help her get better. Yet she wouldn't work in therapy. So I found myself, desperate to get her to work, starting a prayer in the middle of a therapy session asking the Lord to help her to work. She was complaining the whole time I was praying, and yes, I did stop and tell her that it was rude to complain while someone was talking to God. Please don't judge me. I was desperate.

       I know the Lord  made each of us for a large purpose that we may never know. I have no question about that. But I love that the God I serve pays close attention to the small details, which he created just for his joy and pleasure. I like to rely on that theory of mine when I constantly end up in unpredictable situations that "only Caroline could get into," as my family would lovingly say. These situations are usually a byproduct of my one or more of the following: my obsessive planning going three sheets to the wind, my clumsiness, my constant unexplainable need to move at a breakneck pace (or being a bull in a china cabinet as my father would say), and my perfected skill of thinking before speaking. I think God relies on these tendencies of mine for a     good occasional laugh. (At least I know my family does).      I have had to laugh at myself over the past couple of months of getting settled in Nashville. Here I am, a major planner, who had no aspirations of moving away from Arkansas. But then God decided to remind me who's the boss, and here I am. :) He is constantly reminding me that we can both work out the details, but his are usually the best. I usually waste my energy trying to work   out the details only to be gently reminded that he had it planned all along. Here a few of the many blessings the Lord has graciously given me over these two months of settling into Nashville. These are just glimpses. Details to follow...:       *  I have realized that my family is so incredibly strong. I am away, but I always feel so loved and supported, regardless of the distance.    * I love my apartment: very cozy, very cute, very SAFE (for all of my second parents out there), very Caroline    * My employer is such a blessing. They really support me and they told me that they pray for me on a regular     basis .   * Working with older people is both challenging and hilarious...Stay tuned. This could very likely be the     main   source of   humor and comedy in this journal.    * Having grown up in one church where everyone thinks they know me better than I know myself :), I was     apprehensive about being the new face at a church. But the Lord has blessed me with a great church home   (otter creek church).   And it has a wonderful singles group that is supportive, warm, and laid back. It's great   to have a group of Christian peers my age who are in the same stage of life that I am in.    * God is blessing me with new friends weekly, and I am never alone. It's amazing how he works out those    details.   * And last but not least-Being close to my best friends Holly and TJ is such an incredible blessing (who is      solely   responsible for this journal idea to begin with!).          All of these blessings have challenged me to realize that if God works out all those little details for me, He is working out the big ones as well. And though I would love to volunteer my time and energy to help with those details, He's doing fine on his own.
