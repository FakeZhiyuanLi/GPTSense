      Ok, so I was dating this guy. Don't think I've mentioned him yet...if so, this is an update. If not, well this will be new. Anyways...  I dated this guy, "J", for a year. And almost immediately after our one year anniversary, we called it quits. It was a case of him needing his space type things. But not really. Well... ok, yea we'll call it that. I can't exactly describe my mood after that time. I was feeling so many things. But for right now, I'll just say I was pissed. No. Pissed to the 10th power.    *Sidebar*  I don't do short term relationships. I'm in it for the long haul. I've been in 2 major relationships prior to this one, both of which lasted for well over a year. One was almost 2 years. Anyway, I am ALL about give and take. I'm ALL about working things out (if at all possible). The way I see it, whenever I get married, that's gonna be it! Don't get it twisted, I will NOT be doing the J.Lo style of marriage. When it happens, it will surely be "until death do us part".  *End of Sidebar*   Therefore, when J and I broke up, I was pissed. Ugh. So OF COURSE, he has been contacting me lately (by email).  I KNEW this would happen! Ugh. Whatever man. I'm nice though, I respond and all. I keep my responses short and sweet. In his last response though, he mentions that "I am the best" and how he's glad that I have "shown him so much". WTF? Ugh! I KNEW this would happen! MEN! Grrrr!!! Man, I can't even get into it right now. It would be the longest blog EVER! Ok, maybe not  ever . I will say that he was the first person I dated that just had SO much going on in his life prior to us meeting.   Here's a quick rundown: He is divorced, w/ three kids and he's 11 yrs older than me.  Yea, just go ahead and let your imagination run wild.  It wasn't as bad as it sounds. Well...maybe. Things started to get pretty hairy with him and his ex (who is a Class A  Biatch ... and I'm NOT just saying that). He was trying to get sole custody of his children. Oh yea, it was getting u-g-l-y. His ex is/was not having it. Then, on top of all that, he's trying to work two jobs (one full, one part time), find a new full-time job...the list goes on. So I had to call it off. I thought that maybe giving him space for a while would help, but it only made me sad and upset. Soooo, I just said forget it. It was SO hard for me to do that. Like I said, I am in it for the long haul. I believe in working things out and working w/ a person as much as I can. I really loved him (not in love, but definitely loved him). But sometimes, you just gotta let people go. If it weren't for his baggage, he and I would definitely be together and it would be SO great! He was a perfect gentleman. He was actually the perfect guy for me: smart, cute, funny, generous, caring, sweet...omg was he a SWEETHEART!!! He did everything for me just because he wanted to. And he didn't even snore!!!! My gosh, do you know how hard it is to find a man that doesn't snore??!! Geez...what more could I ask for. Ok enough of my sad story. I need to write a book.

      Man, I have been broke as all hell lately. SO need to start my business. This is getting ridiculous! For the past like, 3 months, I've been seriously living check2check. I HATE that! I mean, I have just enough to pay off bills, rent and car. Then, that's it. I can buy like a small coffee. Seriously, that's how I feel sometimes. *sigh* Must start my business.

      Lately, I've been doing a lot of research. I'm really itching to get my web business up and running. Hence, why I haven't blogged in like 5 days. I may be here and there w/ blogging b/c I'm trying to devote every spare minute I have to getting my business going.   It's so hard b/c I wish I had someone to do research for me. I sorta hinted to my friend for help, but she didn't really take the bait. I actually had asked her before to help and she said she would. However, I think she may have realized that she may need to focus on her own life right now. I completely understand...she's married, has a house, has her own issues, etc. It's not a big deal. I can do this all myself. It's actually helping me become a Google queen. I've found out how to do searches better than ever now. So it's all good. I just wish I had someone to share this with, ya know? Not necessarily a significant other, but just someone who will not get sick of me talking about this. Well, I'll do what I can and just go w/ the flow. I'm really excited though. I've found out lots of info and it's really reassured me about the business. OH, I did find one thing that bothered me. I looked at my county's business name database and WOW! There are a lot of web design businesses. Well the key thing for me to do is to find out if these businesses are REALLY in business. Also, I had thought of this pretty great name and WHY does someone have it already!? Sons of biatches! Damn man, that pissed me off. Oh well, so it goes. It was a great name, but I can think of others. If not, I'll just go w/ my initials and call it a day.   In other news...  Work is going ok. One of our co-workers was mad at everyone. I have no idea why. Well she was mad at one of my co-w's in particular but she basically stopped talking to all of us for like 5 days. WTF? This job is SO not that deep. It was over something dumb. Whatever. That's why I really have to pick my battles here. I also have to just ignore a lot b/c it's SO hard to be at work when you are not in good terms w/ ppl. I mean, my job has me working closely with three others all day. We work at a reception desk, so we can't go into our offices if we get mad/tired/irritated w/ someone. Our office IS the reception desk. It sucks. That's why it's such a push for me to get my business really going and maybe by next year, I can just quit and go full-time. I mean, I like my job. It's trying at times. But I've been there for a little over 2 yrs...well it's like almost 2 1/2 yrs. Damn. Where does the time go? Yea, it's time for me to get the heck out.

      Took a final exam today for my LAN class. Failed. Miserably. Ugh. But I'm glad b/c that class is SO over (fyi: I said that in my best Chandler Bing voice). Well, so it goes. I don't think I will be able to handle getting my Masters if I can't even take some measly certification classes. Ay carumba! School sucks.

      Ok, so I'm sitting at work and I am yet again annoyed. How is it that some people can be so rude? So mean? Sooooo ANNOYING?!? I don't get it. GRRRR! Must get the hell up out this place. Pronto.   In other news...  I finished my final for one of my classes. I don't know how I'll do. It's pretty nifty, I think. I sorta worked hard on it, but not really. I started it, umm, last night! lol! I'm so bad. I wish I had started it earlier, but I'm the Procrastination Queen. So I of course started it the night before it was due. Well, two days before, really. Still, I should've started it waaaay earlier. It came out ok though. I should get at least a B. There was one part that I didn't do, but that's ok. He shouldn't mark down too much for it. I don't care at this point. All I know is that it's done. I still have a few more things to turn in though by this Friday. I need to try and work on that stuff soon b/c it's already Wed. Whew, so much to do!

      I called my dad today to wish him a Happy Dad's day. We had the usual quick conversation. My dad's not a phone person nor is he a talker. Well, neither am I really. I wish I had went and spent the day with him though. I made the mistake of using my gas to go to Lansing yesterday to hang w/ my girls. I had a good time though, so it was not a waste at all. Anyway, I need to figure out what to get my dad for Dad's day. I'm the queen of the late gift. I always say, better late than never. So I can take this week to surf the net for some ideas.  My dad has expensive tastes, so I always feel like I need to get him something pricey. But he knows I can't afford pricey, so he accepts anything I get him. That's one thing about my dad, he will NOT pass up a gift :) Cool beans.  Today was sort of a dry day. I went to work to do some updating on our office website. I'm supposed to meet w/ my boss tomorrow so we can talk about the changes I've made. This site has taken me FOREVER to do. But it's almost done. Hopefully I can release it to the office by the end of the summer. It's gonna be tight. I'm real proud of it.   I'm feeling like apple pie, ice cream and some Redi whip.  peace

      Got my hur did today :) lol...damn Nelly. Him and his "midwest slang". That's funny. I'm from the midwest and I don't say "hur" (aka hair) or "therr" (aka there). For some reason, a lot of ppl I know seem to think a lot of Afr-Ams in the midwest are sorta southern-like. I think it's just from a lot of southerners that moved to the north back in the day. I mean, we all know that a lot of African-Americans moved north to escape slavery. And even after, there were a lot of Afr-Ams that moved north for better opportunities in terms of jobs and such (even w/ slavery gone, segregation was alive and well in the South for a long period of time). Hmm, I should ask my mom. She's from Louisiana and moved to Mich back in the early 70s. I wonder what her motivation was... I'll keep you posted.  So my hair is fried, dyed and laid to the side. Ok, everything except the dyed part. Sometimes, just sometimes, I wish I didn't have to torture myself w/ these relaxers. I was on fi-yah today! For those who have not experienced a relaxer, DO NOT scratch any surface of your head at least 3-4 days before getting one. Guaranteed, you will be on FI-YAH! Whew! Glad that's over with. Now I can go prance around w/ my sleek 'do! I guess it's all worth it in the end to look like the hot, goddess that I am. hehe. I kill me!

      Thank God it's Friday! Work was a slow, nasty biatch this week. I hate sitting there, day in, day out. It's so fucking pointless. I REALLY wish they would get a fucking clue and put us on some summer hours. At least on Fridays. As I  urlLink mentioned , I work in an academic setting. Right now, we are dealing w/ summer orientation. Yes, this is where all the little freshmen (or freshies as I like to call them) come to pick out their classes and register for the Fall. Well on Fridays, the last group of the week registers that morning. So after about 10:30ish, the office is dead. Silent. *pin dropping* It's horrible! I just want to strangle myself. It's bad. So I sit there, pretending to do work. We play computer games, shoot the sh*t... that's about it. I mean, when there's  nothing  to do.  Well my boss, realizing how ultra slow it is, gives us this task list of stuff to do. OMG, shoot me. BUSY WORK! She gives us freakin busy work. What the bloody hell!? I doubt we'll do this, but let's give it a try. Now, I'm the only one that has a real job to do. I have designed an intra-office website for the advisors to use. It's a manual that basically describes how to do my job (if they sub for me or any of my CWs.) It's damn good if I say so myself. hehe :)  So anyway, I'm supposed to be doing that. I've done a lot with it. I need to go into work on Sunday and work on it some. I used to do it from home, but I need to upgrade my version of Dreamweaver. I really need to get this project done. I've been working on it forever now. I guess I don't have too much more to go with it though. We'll see.    HOT AS HELL  My apt is on blaze. I'm trying not to run the a/c that must b/c the bill is gonna be a beast as it is. My apt is an all-electric deal, so the bill can get on the high side in the summer. Usually, my apt isn't too bad, but it's been amazingly hot already. I guess it has been pretty hot the last few days. But still, I don't remember my apt being this hot last summer. It's a pretty nice night out, so I've got the windows open. Fan whirring. It's not doing a damn thing.    Cutie Boy  My friend Kel is such a cutie. I told him he could come through tonight if he got bored. Hmmm, I hope he does. We'll see. Could be an interesting night. I've known this kid since 97? Something like that. Well we had hooked up for a while, but I decided he was too young (he's 4 yrs younger than I). I was in my soph yr in college when he was still a soph in high school! Yea, can we say "robbing the cradle"? lol! He's such a cutie boy though. :) He's just how I like'm: tall, light and super-duper cute! *sigh*

      Today sucks for some reason. I don't know why. I don't really wanna be at work today and I want to go home and do some life planning. Well, I'm not really feeling like talking, but I'll bore everyone today with my nonsense anyway.  Oh I know. I can talk about myself (lol). I used to blog back in the day but I deleted all that stuff though. So I'll start from scratch...   Name:  Split P.  Why Split P.? Well it's short for Split "Personality". Yea that sounds a little crazy-psycho, doesn't it? But no,I'm not crazy. It's just that sometimes, I feel like I'm a lot of different people. I have been pondering the question, "who am I?" lately. I don't feel like I need to just be one person. I mean, my personality is so vast. I have been influenced by so much. I don't know. I feel like I don't want to be known as just one set of traits/characteristics. Like, "oh that's Split P. and she's so nice and generous". Sometimes I wanna be Split P. the spontaneous chick w/ an eye for trendy fashion. Or Split P. the deep thinker. I don't know. I wanna be a lot of different things, so Split P. came to mind. Plus, there's a small play on the word "split pea"...like the soup. I thought that was sorta cute. Although, I'm not a big fan of peas. ew.    Ethnicity:  African-American   Hometown:  Detroit, baby! Home of the  urlLink NBA World Champion Detroit Pistons ! Deeeeetroit Bas-ket-ball!   Age:  25   Fam & Sibs:  I have a mom and a dad. I'm the 6th kid of 6. And contrary to popular belief, I'm really not spoiled.    Schools:  I went to Catholic school from 1st thru 12th grade. I think I liked my 7th-12th grade years the most. I went to this pre-dom white school starting in the 7th gr. It was cool. I was a little nervous at first, but I got used to it and met some of the greatest people. I miss that school. For college, I went to the  urlLink University of Michigan . GO BLUE! I have a degree in  urlLink  Cultural Anthropology . GO PRIMATES!   Work:  I work for UofM in the  urlLink College of Literature, Science and Arts  (LSA). I'm a Student Services Asst in the advising center. It's pretty fun, but as I expressed earlier, I need to get a new job. Although one day, I would like to be an advisor. I really enjoy helping the "kids" =)   Life:  Well, I'm an aspiring web designer. I have been doing web design for about 4 1/2 years. It's sorta funny b/c although I really enjoy web design, I don't have my own website. Go figure. I have created several prototypes, but have scrapped them all. I am too picky when it comes to myself. But I have designed a couple other sites though. My best work is my sorority's  urlLink site  (more on that later). Next year, I'm looking to move outta my apt and into a spacious condo (shhh it's a secret...not really but don't tell anyway). The trick is to get the funds together. Hence, why I need to get my web design business up and running. I just got this book,  urlLink  Home-Based Business for Dummies  to start things off. So far, so good.    My Sorority:  It's later. I am in a multicultural sorority called  urlLink Zeta Sigma Chi . I have been in the sorority for almost 5 years now. I really enjoy being in the organization, but it has it's moments. Definitely more about that later. Right now, I'm a member of the Alumnae Association. However, I have held several positions, including National President. Now, I just wanna focus on myself and sorta chill.   Ok, that's a lot about me. Hope it's not boring b/c I feel like the most boring person on the face of this earth sometimes. But drama free is the way to be!  urlLink

      Who the hell came up w/ this show? I am really not liking Fear Factor. I think this is the worst show EVER! Making people do dangerous ass sh*t for money. Has anyone ever died on this show? My gosh, I can't stand it. I just think this is some bull. I mean, play the lottery. Gamble. Go on a game show (Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, Price is Right just to name a few favs). But Fear Factor?? Sorry, but FUUUCK that! It's not that deep people, it's not that deep.

      I'm really ready to leave work. Not just for the day but for real. I mean, it's a good job and all but I'm just getting super irritated by people. I am not one to gossip...really. I mean, I like a good story here and there. But jeez ppl, get a freaking life! I mean, don't you all have something better to do than just talk about people? Guess not. It's just frustrating. As I said, I like to hear a good, juicy story every now and then. Like, "Oh guess who's leaving?" or "I heard we're not getting a raise next year" (I did not hear the last comment and I hope I NEVER hear that). But I can handle those things. What I can't handle are mean words that can get said about people. My thing is, you just never know what's going on with a person.   For instance, we had a co-worker that was consistently out for about two months (maybe more). So much gossip went on about that, I really thought I was gonna lose it. Everyday, someone had something mean to say. The reality of the situation was that this person is possibly suffering from depression. I'm not entirely sure, but I heard that from some co-workers who chose not to gossip. Well at that point, I felt so bad. I just kept thinking, what if she does something horrible to herself? I mean, I learned a little bit about depression in one of my Psych courses and it is a serious illness. I don't know, I just felt like that was so disrespectful to talk about someone like that. Then I kept thinking, what's stopping anyone else at that job from talking about me that way if I just suddenly stopped coming to work. Ugh, it makes me sick. I don't think that's right at all. Gossip is bad as it is. I feel like some people at my job can just take gossip too far. It's really not that deep people. The worst thing for me is that not only do they say mean things, but they say them ALL the time! Ummm, must we talk about this sh*t every day!?! SO annoying.  Well in my attempt to block things out, I end up looking like the goody-two-shoes. Like I can't talk to anyone or that I'm above all the gossip. Well I'd rather be that than be a bitchy, gossipy blankety-blank!

      Wow! Can you say "blowout"? Damn, what an awesome game. I'm from Detroit (born and bred) so of course I was watching the home team  urlLink slaughter  the Los--I mean, Lakers. I can't believe we were up by like 28 points! WTF?! That was amazing!   I'm very proud of our team but even more proud of my fellow Detroiters. No,  urlLink Mr. Kimmel , we did NOT burn our city to the ground. But we DID party like it's nobody's business. Whatever Kimmel. I love that we kicked LA's asses all up and down that court. The Lakers may have been the sh*t at some point in time, but it's our time to shine now. So take that, Kimmel  *sticking tongue out*   Now I know I should be shouting for joy from the rooftops, but I'm sorta curious. Where will Kobe go? 'Cuz he's not staying in LA, that's for sure. I mean, despite his subpar performance in the Finals, he  IS  an amazing player. He really came through on some big shots for the Lakers (still trying to forget Game 2's last minute trey though). And I HAVE to say this about Kobe....he's FINE as hell! Wow, could he BE any cuter??? Too bad he cheated on his wife though...bummer. But he's still fine. mmm mmm MMMM  Ok, enough Kobe talk, time to C-E-L-E-B-R-A-T-E!!!

      I picked up this book today called Home-Based Business for Dummies. How geeked am I? VERY. I am trying to read it at work but I can't (too much going on). But I am so excited to get my business started. I think it's going to be great. I hope that it all works out. This book is already telling me some great information. I have got to start this business very soon so that I can start building more income. I have a big goal ahead of me (I have to keep that secret for now) that I want to achieve next year. If I can make this business happen, my chances of achieving my goal will be dramatically increased! Yippee!

      It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day in the hood...   I'm at work and starving. Not a good combo. I tend to become this beast when I'm super hungry. I guess that's a trait that comes out in all of us though. One thing's for sure, besides being hungry, I'm annoyed. HIGHLY. I have this coworker who really gets on my everlasting nerves. We all have them. I think there's probably a cult or something filled w/ these types. Their sole purpose is to spread their annoying-ness (like that?) to all who come into contact with them. Ugh. It sickens me that they don't realize just how annoying they are. It's like, don't you know that you are really bugging the shit outta me? Guess not...  Well Mr. Annoying...hmm... I need a name for him. He really deserves something fitting. Let me sit on that for a while. Anyway, Mr. Annoying is one of those I-must-talk-to-you-even-if-you-don't-want-to-talk-to-me type ppl. AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH! It's like dude, get a F-ing clue! I'm really feeling the rage right now... can't ya tell??

      I'm so tired right now but I'm up watching Conan O'Brian. Usher is on there and I can't help but to think of the conversation that my friends and I had. Does he REALLY swing the other way (on the ultra DL, of course)? Hmm, I don't know. It's hard to say. There's nothing wrong with it if he does. However, it bothers me that others think he's something he's not. I mean, he  is  giving off mega metrosexual vibes, ya know? But is there something more? Hmm, let me ponder this more as I go to sleep.

      (that was for all ya'll Digable Planet fans)  Welcome to my blog (if anyone is really reading this). I used to be a blogger back in the day, however, the need to physically write got the best of me. Well I had a friend send me his  urlLink moblog . So I decided to get back into blogging and hopefully I can stay with it this time around. Wish me luck!  So since this is my "first" blog, I should probably tell you all something about myself. Well, I'm a decrepit, old lady that owns about 50 cats. Juuuust kidding (although....naw, j/k). I'm a 25 y.o University of Michigan grad. I currently work for the U doing a job that I like 50% of the time. I am hoping to one day (very, very soon) start my own web design business. I'm getting an Internet and Web Design certification right now through  urlLink Kaplan College . It's pretty nifty, however, some of the classes I could totally do w/out. It's all gravy though.   What else can I say right now (I'm a little on the sleepy side). Well how's bout I blog tomorrow and give you the full insight to the world known as ME :-)   peace & love

      I just finished watching Monster. Mmm, I'm slightly disturbed. Maybe more than slightly. But let me share some thoughts....OH, if you haven't seen this, then you probably don't wanna read this post. Unless, you don't care! ha! Enjoy...  1. Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci as a lesbian couple. Hmmm... all I kept thinking about was that it had to be super gross for Christina to kiss Charlize w/ those nasty fake yellow teeth in her mouth. EW! Ugh, just thinking about that makes me want to vomit.  *yak yak*  The second gross thing about them was that Charlize's character was this, like, homeless prostitute. I'm assuming she was not very, um, clean? Yet, Christina's character was looking at her like yum-yum! ew.  *yak yak*  Ok, I gotta move on b/c I'm gonna vomit... Oh, one more thing. The love scene! How could I forget about this! Ok, so I couldn't really get into it b/c I kept thinking "OMG, Christina Ricci and Charlize Theron are doing it!" I mean, it just didn't look right. I mean, Charlize is considerably older than Christina, right? It just looked like Charlize was sleeping w/ her daughter or something! Not cool. I know it was a movie and they're playing roles, but I just couldn't get into it like that. Alright, moving on for real...  2. I felt super bad for the last dude that Charlize shot. I was slightly in tears.  3. The rape scene--terrifying! I can't EVEN imagine what must've gone through her mind. Well, she thought she was gonna die for sure. At that moment, I had no problems w/ her shooting that dude. None whatsoever! But after that... mmm, she was really off the hook.  4. I am fascinated by the character's willingness to kill. Her enjoyment in it. It was crazy. I just can't even imagine shooting someone. wow. That was deep. I wish we could've heard more of her thoughts during the killings. I'm kinda fascinated by serial killers. Their minds are very interesting to study from what I've read in my Psych classes.  Alright, that's all I have for now. Just wanted to get that out b/c there was so much going on in that movie. Overall, I'd give it 4 stars. Charlize definitely deserved the Oscar, not only b/c of her performance, but for her transformation! DAMN! I just couldn't believe that was her at all. I just kept staring at her. Simply amazing!

      Good Morning everyone! That's right, I said "morning". Yes, check the date and time of this post. It's Saturday morning @ about 10:40. What the hell is going on!? I can't believe I'm really up this early in the morning...on a freakin Saturday no less. But wait, I was actually up at 8:30! Yes, 8:30 people. I just decided now to blog about it. Wait, this story gets better. When I got up, I got ready (washed and dressed in lounge wear) and went out! Yes, I left the building... and I went and got some 4bucks [a venti soy latte for those interested in my coffee tastes]. I cannot believe it.  I'm becoming my mother.  Only my mom (or anyone's mom, I think) would be out that early in the morning--on a Saturday--getting coffee AND contemplating running errands. Oh yea, I am contemplating going to run my errands; like right NOW... after I finish blogging.  America. This is a sad yet semi-intriguing day in my life. I'm 25 and I'm becoming my mother. Great. What's next? No no, nevermind. I don't wanna know.  Alright, carry on!

      Alright, so last night I was having a very creative moment. I was up pretty late thinking about some things that are going on w/ me.&nbsp; I wanted to share, but it was 2:30a and I really needed to get to sleep. So now that I'm fully awake and the coffee drip is in (oh yea, baby!), I shall spew off some of those thoughts...   Thought #1  I just realized that I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;few crushes going on in my life right now! Don't you love when you're crushing on someone? How great is that feeling? I love how you get all weak in the knees and sorta can't think of what to say. It's just great. It can be frustrating too, but I'm not gonna get into that (that'll bring down my mood, I think). But I like to crush on someone, it's just fun. So I'm sure you wanna know who I'm crushing on. Wellllll, I'm just gonna keep that to myself. haha! Sorry, I'm not gonna share that much info w/ the world, but I will say that I'm really enjoying daydreaming about my said crushes. Oh, I will say that I have  6  crushes right now!! FUN! And don't worry, they are  real  ppl. Some I don't have a chance with, but the others are possibilities [insert evil laugh here] :)&nbsp; I should say that some of these crushes aren't that strong. I mean, some of them are just a general liking for the person. Ya know, they are cute and sweet, so I just really like them. But others...well, I have more advanced feelings for them (lol). Um yea, I'll stop there.    Thought #2  Love/Hate Relationships. You love'm. You hate'm. That's what makes the world go round. I was thinking about this love/hate relationship I have w/ a friend of mine. Right now, I'm feeling closer to the hate side. I feel bad for saying "hate". I should call this a like/dislike relationship. So anyway, I'm closer to the dislike side right now. I am so... so... annoyed right now w/ this person! Grrrr! I just don't understand it all really. Ok, check this:  My best friend and I&nbsp;have&nbsp;known each other&nbsp;since 7th grade.&nbsp;Currently, she lives in Sterling Heights, about an hour or so from me. Now, since we're both so busy, we get together like once a year. Seriously. But whenever we do find time to see each other, it's like we haven't missed a beat! I LOVE that! I really love her to death. I love her b/c we've been friends for like, 13 years(?), and we've NEVER fought! Ever. And we can just talk talk talk talk talk and talk! When we were in school together, we used to talk on the phone for hours and hours... usually about nothing important, but you know how it is when you're that age. The point is, we can still talk for that long whenever we see each other (mainly b/c we don't see each other often, but also b/c that's how we are). And we've never had arguements or anything that made me feel... I don't know...annoyed with her. Or like I don't want to be friends with her. We just click very well.   Ok, so back to the subject. This like/dislike relationship I have w/ this person is SO frustrating. When it's in "like" mode, it's good. But when it's in "dislike", I just really want to end our friendship. I guess I just feel like, how come I can't have a normal relationship w/ this person instead of this back and forth thing. The funny thing is, I don't think this person sees our relationship like I do. They probably think it's all good. And when I'm acting "funny" to them, they think I'm overreacting about whatever it is that's frustrating me. *sigh* I don't know what to do about that. I just hate being friends w/ someone if I can't truly like them. I just need balance damnit! I'm a Libra for goodness sake, I need equality and stability. Alright, moving on...   Thought #3  Another start is in the works for me. A new life. A change.&nbsp; Yes, it'sa coming. You will see a change in my blog title, for starters. I think the title will better reflect the vibe of my blog. Next change will be the long awaited start of my business. Very soon my children, very soon.    Remember my deadline... 8/1/04.   &nbsp;Finally, my&nbsp;living quarters. Currently, I'm purging all the crap in my apt. It's currently in a state of shock, but by next week it'll be a whole new place. Mmmhmm, change is a coming  (why do I feel like singing a negro spiritual right now?)   Alright, time to go. But before I do, look at my horoscope for today!:     Let go of as much as it takes to regain your sense of balance and clean the lens of memory so it does not distort your true vision. Instead of bemoaning what can't be changed, resolve to do better in the future. If you don't want to look forward, at least stop and look around at what's in front of you. That might be all the change you need for now.     What the hell!??    "Let go of as much as it takes to regain your sense of balance..."    Did I not just write that I need balance? Did I not? Uhhhhh, YEA I did! That is freaky. Too freaky.

       Ok, so I just logged off and tried logging in again and it said the page was unavailable. BOOTLEG Blogger!!! Why are you acting up on me all of a sudden? It didn't want to let me in! Sorry, I just had to vent! If there is any Blogger techs reading this: Fix it! It's saying that pages aren't available and stuff.     &nbsp;   Anyways.... &nbsp;:)     &nbsp;   Uh, yea, so I am CRACKING up about something. I was just informed that "everyone" is reading my blog. Hmm, really??? That's so funny!! I heard my blog was "all the rage" these days. LOL! Yea. RIIIIIIIIGHT! I don't believe that for one second. BUT... if it is true, I'd just like to say thanks for reading my blog :-) Even though I totally doubt it's all the rage, it is nice to know that ppl are reading. I enjoy writing. And if ppl are reading what I write, even better. I think it's funny though. I know ppl are looking at the page&nbsp;(from profile views and comments). But it's just funny. I feel slightly giddy about this. Hmm, don't you all feel slightly voyeuristic reading my blog? Like, ooh, let's see what's going on w/ her today! LOL! Ok, I'm being a bit dramatic, but I know the feeling. I enjoy reading blogs b/c ppl have some really interesting thoughts out there. I need to get more of my deeper thoughts out here to share. I used to do this a lot w/ my friends, but I've been slacking. I think I've become a surface person. That's pretty lame. I don't wanna be like, however, I don't wanna just share share share when no one else does. That's not fun either. Also, I'm a bit afraid to share real thoughts b/c I've always been the "weird" one amongst friends. Not like the  weird  one that no one wants to hang with (uh oh, I shouldn't have said that...now you all are thinking "Yea, she's the  weird  one"... damnit!) haha...no seriously, I'm not weird like that. I just think differently, that's all. Oh well, I'll stop explaining b/c I feel like I'm digging myself into a hole.&nbsp;

      Well, today was an ok day. I worked on my work website a lot today. I have to meet w/ my boss to go over all the changes I've made to it. It's looking really good and some of the advisors have complimented me on it. I can't wait until it goes live. I think it'll be a great resource for all of them. I do need to tell my boss that we need to come up a plan in terms of making additions to the site. Every time we meet, I swear she comes up with like 10 more things to add. I had to change the layout of the site b/c she kept telling me to add more stuff. Some of the stuff seemed useful, but some stuff is not necessary. I mean, she knows how folks are in our office. They are truly, truly set in their ways.  We have ways of finding information and if it's not on this site, that's ok. She wants like an all-in-one info center on the web. Thank God I don't know some things, b/c she asked for stuff that I can't do. I'm just so tired of going back and forth w/ her about stuff. *sigh* I had class tonight. So boring. I hate Net Admin. I will never care about servers...ever. Ever. So I just sat there reading everyone's messages. I'm glad that my class is talkative cuz I don't think anyone noticed I didn't say anything. Well, except my prof. But whatever, at least I went. Ok, next time, I'll participate. I am behind in reading and the book we have is HUGE! It's gotta be about 400 pages. Maybe more. I hate books like that for these type of courses. Nine times outta ten, the book is BO-RING! And trust me, I read like a paragraph and was knocked out instantly. So yea, I am not enjoying this class at all.   Hey Daddio!  My dad's b-day is next Sat but I'm going to spend some time w/ him on Friday. I am not really sure what to get him though. I  have  to get something b/c I didn't get him anything for Father's Day. I know, bad daughter! But it's ok b/c I didn't get my mom anything for Mom's Day (lol). I'm on a budget...sorta. I have just been broke as hell lately. It's really sad, but hey, what can I do. My priorities are my bills and as long as they are paid, then I can't complain. So what if I can't eat? Who needs food anyway? I can just say I'm on a diet...yea that's the ticket!  Anyway, so I gotta get him something for his b-day. Not sure what though. The problem w/ my dad is that he's got expensive taste (hmm, that's where I get it from). He wants jewelry and electronic crap...all the stuff I can't afford. Yea, um, so I'm stuck. I got him a dominoes set last year. It was nice though. It came in this wonderful wooden box. I thought he might like that since he gets bored a lot. But I don't think he's even played it. Oh well. So maybe I'll continue w/ the game thing and get something bigger and better. I can probably spend about $40-50 on him this time around. However, I am a broke person living beyond my means (if you call where I live, living beyond my means), so I'll be looking for something under 50 bucks...hm, well under 40 bucks ;-) Well off to watch the news and see what horrible things took place today. Ciao!

      I was looking through some other blogs today and I found a blog about someone who seemingly wanted to..umm.. well, they wanted to end their life. It was scary reading it. I'm a little shaken by it. I didn't know if I should've responded or what. I wish I had. Just to let that person know that someone is listening to them. Even though I don't know the person, I just thought that maybe they'd feel better knowing someone is reading their blog.&nbsp; I hope they can get over feeling the way they do. I said a little prayer for them.

       I'm tired today. I've got class tonight and I'm not really looking forward to that. I just hate sitting at the computer, watching everyone talk about stuff. And my professor is somewhat of a weirdo this term. I mean, he's knowledgable and all, but I don't like the questions he asks. They are crazy! They just don't make sense. Then when we are silent (b/c we don't understand what the hell he's asking) he starts saying, "C'mon! Let's think everyone!" I'm like, what? Think about what? I'm not sure what the hell you're even asking! So then he'll throw us a little more info and then we answer. It's just&nbsp;a weird situation. Tomorrow I have my other class which I know I will not do well in b/c I'm not interested in it at all. It's network administration. boooooo! How boring! I'm trying to psych myself up so that maybe I'll be remotely interested in it. But I can't do it. I even brought it to work and I don't even wanna open up the book! It's a big giant book...like 400+ pages. Ugh. Can't wait til this is over.     &nbsp;   I'm at work and orientation is going on. The kids are swimming in and out of the office. I kinda like it b/c you can people watch and such. It's amazing what these little 18 year old chicks will wear. It's like, hello! Get a clue! This is not the place to be wearing your more skimpiest outfit. Save that for the bar, thanks.

      yesterday weren't bad enough. Geez! Let's just say I HATE BEING A WOMAN!   Ok. Breathe.  *breathing*  I just needed to let that out. I'll be ok...give or take 6 days or so.   So as I suffered through my...um...issues today, I managed to do absolutely  nothing  at work or for school. Well, I just wasn't in the mood.&nbsp;However, I&nbsp;need to really get over myself b/c I am not starting my semester off right at all. I'm so ashamed. I've become my Junior year slacker self again. Yes, back in my junior year at UMich, I totally fell off the wagon. I mean, I fell and I hit hard. I landed right on probation! Yea, it was ugly. And not only once, but  twice  for goodness sake! So I gotta get back on the wagon. Quick quick like a bunny! I have one more term after this one, so I need to pull myself together.   Please repeat: You can do it. You can do it. You can do it......chugga chugga chugga chugga CHOO CHOO!  Sorry...got wrapped up in the whole... nevermind.&nbsp; I better go now.

      What is really wrong w/ me? Why can't I do homework? Why? Is it that hard? Not really. I'm just a procrastinator. I've literally wasted this entire day. Doing what? Well let's see. I got up at like 9:30, however, I didn't get outta bed til about 11-ish. This is when I realized I really wanted a Caramel Macchiato from Fourbucks. So I lept outta bed, got ready and headed out. I got there and there were like TONS of ppl!? Why did everyone and they mama want coffee when  I  wanted coffee?? Geez! Got my coffee and got back home.   It was about Noon when I sat down to do hw. I  really  attempted to do it. I wrote down my assignment and started to do it. I had to surf the net for sites that had improper uses of web content. Ummm, do you know how hard that is!? Like... that's like looking for a needle in a fucking haystack! I mean, there are millions of sites out there and I'm supposed to surf the web for a bad one. Now, you'd think that it would be easy. You'd  think  that for every great site, there's a horrible one. Ok, if that's true, how come I didn't find not one damn site w/ bad content!  NOT ONE!  I surfed for like an hour. I took a break. Listened to music for a while. Then watched some HGTV. Then back to work.  STILL  couldn't find one. What the hell! I was so mad. I mean, it was actually difficult to find a bad site. I think nowadays, everyone is taking care in how they make their web presentations. Well, at least in terms of businesses and organizational websites. I started looking for personal websites after a while. I knew there had to be some bad sites then. But I didn't really wanna look at personal sites. But I looked. I didn't look long though b/c my eyes were killing me. They still are.   Well needless to say, I did not do my assignment. I had like 2 assignments to do for this class and I'm not doing either until tomorrow. I'm so fucking tired of being on the computer. And that's pretty sad coming from someone who absolutely loves the computer and the internet.   I don't even care anymore. I'll turn this crap in late and take whatever grade I get. I'm gonna do it at work tomorrow. I'll be awake and I'll actually have a desk to work on. That's another reason I can't do work. I don't have a desk. I'm using an end table. I know, what the hell is going on w/me...it's a long story.

      Um, I have no hot water. How can this be you ask? Hmm, I have no clue my damn self, but I know I have no hot water. I wish I could ask some of my neighbors, but I don't know any of them. Well... I do know Ken. But Ken is like the weirdest guy ever! I'm so not asking him. I could ask Purple Truck boy. I could use this opp to find out his actual name. Hmmm, maybe I'll venture down the hall and find out if he has hot water. I could ask the little freaky dude across the hall from me...no, he's too freaky. Freaky as in weird.   Ok, well I guess I'll do w/out it. I could always boil water in the meantime...

      I've been trying to get my apt&nbsp;reorganized for like a week and a half now. No, two weeks. I've made considerable progress in my bedroom and living room. But I've still got more to do. I went to Lowes and bought a shoe rack and canvas box. The shoe rack fits   perfectly   in my closet on the shelf. The canvas box -- so awesome! I will be going back to buy another rack (it's the stackable  and  expandable kind) and another canvas box...maybe 2 boxes. I have a whole list of storage items to buy for my apt actually, but I have to wait for my next pay check. No prob. I'm enjoying my work and hopefully I can rid myself of all the piles of junk I've accumulated for the past 3-4 years!     In other news...    I had another conversation w/ J the other day. Let's just say that I was grinning from ear-to-ear after this one :)&nbsp; So, per our last convo, he was holding off on telling his ex that he did not want to remarry her. I was completely pissed about this, but kept cool. After all, we aren't together anymore, so why do I care? (ok ok, I  DO  care!) Well we talked the other day and I asked if he had spoken to her about the marriage thing. He promptly said, "No." OK. So I asked why and what was the point of holding off on the answer if it was going to be no. He explained that he was only trying to focus on getting custody of his oldest son this fall and that he didn't want to deal w/ her until afterwards. He then said that he knows how she is and if he told her no, she might&nbsp;go back on her word. Wow. My friend&nbsp;was absolutely right!&nbsp;Now I am satisfied that he's just holding out on her to get what he wants. Otherwise, her ass might go postal. Yes, this&nbsp;makes complete sense. He obviously knows what he's doing.  whew !   Well after we talked about that,&nbsp;we just chatted about other stuff. I did most of the talking. During the convo, I asked him if he would like a website for his limo business...for free. Um,&nbsp;needless to say he said&nbsp;"YES!"&nbsp;Well to follow up, I spoke to him yesterday and he told me had some ideas and designs written out that he wants to share w/ me.&nbsp;Damn, he's quick!&nbsp;Hahaha, that's funny...he's such a cutie. :)   What else is going on... I got my hair done today. It's looking pretty nifty. The only thing is, my hairdress doesn't really style my hair well. I mean, she just flips it under. It looks SO lame like that. So I usually get home and restyle it. Not a big deal...I just add a few more curls to it, to give it more body. So now I look like the true diva I am! HA!   I've been staying up REAL late lately. I don't know what the hell is wrong w/ me. I just don't want to sleep. I mean I do, but I don't. I am going through a phase. For some reason, I've been wanting someone to sleep w/ me. Not like that! But ya know, someone to snuggle up to in bed. I LOVE that! This is why I absolutely  must  get married...ok that's not&nbsp;the only reason, but it's a damn good reason (hehe). &nbsp;I hate sleeping alone. I&nbsp;mean I've obviously been doing it for a long time, but there's nothing like sleeping next to someone. Especially when it's chilly outside...woo! Nothing like a warm body next to you. Aaahhh, that's one of the things I miss about not having J around. He was definitely a snuggly guy. And if that weren't the greatest thing, the man did not snore!!! Hello! Do you know how hard it is to find a man that does not snore? Lemme tell ya, it ain't easy! *sigh* I miss my sweetie :(&nbsp;   Alright, since it's like 2am, I should probably go now.  Ciao!

        Ok, here's a freaky revelation. I wanna be a singer. I know, who knew!? No one really. Ok, no one at all. But I guess ppl will know now. lol! I'm watching The (freakin') Ashlee Simpson show (please don't ask why) and I sorta wanna be a singer too! I mean, dare I say this...her show is sorta inspiring. I know I must be the only lunatic out there watching this show but it's kinda inspiring to see how she's starting her music career. It's sorta making me think about it. I don't know though. It would be fun to sing and make a career out of that. However, there's always another side to the story. I mean, what IF I really made it as a singer. What IF I became famous and stuff? Wow, that would rock! But fame (as told by many entertainers) can have its downsides. I don't know if I could handle the constant on-the-go lifestyle. I KNOW I would hate paparazzi. Those ppl are c-r-a-z-y!!! That really bothers me how they can get.&nbsp; I think at first it would be cool. But then, I'd be like, get the hell away from me. Hmm, I don't know. Maybe I could come out w/ like a hit a year? lol&nbsp; I could make some money but not be in the spotlight for too long so ppl would kinda forget about me?&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;   Well, it's certainly very...what's the word....damn, what word am I looking for?? Umm,  INTRIGUING ! Yes, it's intriguing to think about. My God, if I could just make a hit record and get enough money to pay off my bills, that would rock. Then I could quit. LOL! Yea, I make things sound so freakin easy. Get a hit record, pay off my debts and then retire! Oh yea, that's the ticket! ;-)

         (this is a forward I got today) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Too many people put off something that brings them joy just because they&nbsp;&nbsp;haven't thought about it, don't have it on their schedule, didn't know&nbsp; it was coming or are too rigid to depart from their routine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got to thinking one day about all those women on the Titanic who passed up dessert at dinner that fateful night in an effort to cut back.  &nbsp;  From then on, I've tried to be a little more flexible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  How many women out there will eat at home because their husband didn't&nbsp;suggest going out to dinner until after something had been thawed? Does&nbsp;the word "refrigeration" mean nothing to you?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  How often have your kids dropped in to talk and sat in silence while you&nbsp;watched 'Jeopardy' on television?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I cannot count the times I called my sister and said, "How about going&nbsp;to lunch in a half hour?" She would gas up and stammer, "I can't. I&nbsp;have clothes on the line. My hair is dirty. I wish I had known&nbsp;yesterday, I had a late breakfast, It looks like rain." And my personal favorite: "It's Monday." ...She died a few years ago. We never did have&nbsp;lunch&nbsp;together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because Americans cram so much into their lives, we tend to schedule our&nbsp;headaches.. We live on a sparse diet of promises we make to ourselves&nbsp;when all the conditions are perfect!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We'll go back and visit the grandparents when we get Stevie&nbsp;toilet-trained. We'll entertain when we replace the living-room carpet.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  We'll go on a second honeymoon when we get two more kids out of college.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Life has a way of accelerating as we get older. The days get shorter,&nbsp;and the list of promises to ourselves gets longer. One morning, we&nbsp;awaken, and all we have to show for our lives is a litany of "I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;to," "I plan on," and "Someday, when things are settled down a bit."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When anyone calls my 'seize the moment' friend, she is open to&nbsp;adventure and available for trips. She keeps an open mind on new ideas.&nbsp;Her enthusiasm for life is contagious. You talk with her for five&nbsp;minutes, and you're ready to trade your bad feet for a pair of&nbsp;Rollerblades and skip an elevator for a bungee cord.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My lips have not touched ice cream in 10 years. I love ice cream. It's&nbsp;just that I might as well apply it directly to my stomach with a spatua&nbsp;and eliminate the digestive process. The other day, I stopped the  car&nbsp;and bought a triple-decker. If my car had hit an iceberg on the way he, I would have died happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now...go on and have a nice day. Do something you WANT to......not&nbsp;something on your SHOULD DO list. If you were going to die soon and had&nbsp;only one phone call you could make, who would you call and what would&nbsp;you say? And why are you waiting?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Make sure you read this to the end; you will understand why I sent this&nbsp;to&nbsp;you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Have you ever watched kids playing on a merry go round or listened  to the rain lapping on the ground? Ever followed a butterfly's erratic&nbsp;flight or gazed at the sun into the fading night? Do you run through&nbsp;each day on the fly? When you ask "How are you?" Do you hear the reply?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the day is done, do you lie in your bed with the next hundred&nbsp;chores running through your head? Ever told your child, "We'll do it&nbsp;tomorrow." And in your haste, not see his sorrow? Ever lost touch?  Let a&nbsp;good friendship die? Just call to say "Hi"?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     When you worry and hurry through your day, it is like an unopened&nbsp;gift...Thrown away... Life is not a race. Take it slower. Hear the music before the song is over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Life may not be the part! y we hoped for... but while we are here we&nbsp;might as well dance!

       So I've been cleaning my room right? This is Day 2 of my massive room overhaul. I am still in shock about how much stuff I have. I mean, where the hell did it all come from? Well, since yesterday, &nbsp;I&nbsp;have filled 2 garbage bags of shoes, 5 gar. bags of clothes (yes,  5 ) and I'm  still  cleaning stuff out. I haven't even touched my dresser yet!&nbsp;Let the fun begin! The Salvation Army is gonna love my ass fo' sho'! I can't wait to get this crap outta my apt. I feel so light and airy now. I can actually walk into my walk-in&nbsp;closet!! Who knew!?&nbsp;I can browse through my clothes without passing up 10 items before I get to something I have actually worn in the past year. Nice :)    Man,&nbsp;with all the stuff getting cleared out, I have SO much space in my room. I have a pretty big bedroom (14x11). So I've got plenty of room&nbsp;to spread out. Well, I guess I spread out a little bit too much...me and the&nbsp;junk just sorta took over. Anyway,&nbsp;I think I can get my futon in there! How great! I have had this futon  forever ! Seriously. It desperately needs a new cushion (it's  very  flat), but otherwise it's all good. It is a little bent underneath, but it doesn't affect anyone sitting on it. So w/ all my new found space, I might move it my room and see if I can make better use of my living room space. I am planning on getting a loveseat to match my new sofa anyway. Oh this is so fun! Just had to share =)

                Translation: Clean House - Part Two              So I'm still here... cleaning. I have always known that my room was a complete and utter mess. Well, it's like 20 times worse. Ugh! I can't believe how I've completely neglected the upkeep of my bedroom. I mean, it's more than just some clothes scattered about. As much as I hate to admit it, I'm a packrat. But this isn't my fault at all! Nope. It's ALLLLLL my dad's fault. It's even a tad bit of my mom's fault. Yep. It's totally inherited. My parents are packrats too. My dad is much more of one than my mom. My dad is like 90% packrat. My mom, is like 15%. Maybe less. She's gotten better over the years. My dad...just gets worse. So yes, I'm a packrat. It's horrible. But at least I've admitted it. Isn't that the first step to recovery?      &nbsp;   Alright. Back to the mess.  *sigh*

        So, I'm gonna clean my apt today b/c it looks horrendous! Well, it's really my bedroom that looks like a tornado hit it. I need to get rid of so much stuff, it's not even funny. So that's how I'll be spending my Saturday. THEN, at some point I need to start my homework. I started school again and I haven't done a damn thing! I went to class and that's about it. So I need to do some work. Maybe I'll go to campus and work a little bit.        &nbsp;    I haven't talked to J since like two days ago. I assume he has a runs this weekend. I am still upset that he is not really trying to contact me. Hmm, maybe now that he knows I'm cool w/ calling him again, he's taken a step back. Well, little does he know. Looks like it's time for me to cut my communication with him. I already stopped emailing. Ya know, why should I have to do all the work? I don't like that at all. Ya know, he made a big mistake in telling me that he wants to have a relationship and get married again. If he thinks he's gonna ever going to remarry, then he needs to get his act together. He's so hypocritical! Ok. Breathe. I'm not gonna get into it. It's not worth it. I need to clean.        &nbsp;    Read my horoscope for the day though. Pay close attention to the  last 2 lines .          Your reputation for being the peacemaker in the family may come in handy today. Try not to let a partner or relative get too emotional around you. Others may disagree with you for no apparent reason. Don't even try to figure them out. You can't reason with someone on a tirade. They could just be wanting to project their bad mood onto your easygoing nature. Take care if starting new projects or making changes around the home. Watch for complications.                  How crazy is that!!??

      So remember back in the day (last month) when I was talking about Mr. Annoying? Yea, my co-worker who drives me absolutely insane? Yea, he's in rare form today. I'm like, dude! MUST you be a hyperactive child ALL the fucking time!? Geez! Calm your ass down. Get a grip! I mean, it's one thing to joke around, but damn...the "silly" voices, the acting like an idiot, the non-stop sarcasm? C'mon! Give me a break!

      I'm feeling pretty good this morning. I've got my Starbucks soy latte (iced) on my left and I'm just happy as a clam. I spoke to a parent this morning about his son's chem placement at orientation. It was a somewhat heated yet calm debate. In the end, the guy was pretty cool and even asked me what I majored in when I was here. I think I've made a new "friend".  I also had a nice surprise this morning when I checked my cell. J had actually called me back from last night. We had talked  urlLink yesterday  and he said he'd call me back. Well, I guess I didn't really believe him after, oh about 12:30am had come and I was sleepy as hell. So I decided to just let my phone charge up in my living room. I just didn't think he'd call. Guess what? I was wrong. I knew that would happen. He didn't leave a message though. Probably thought he'd wake me by letting the phone ring too much. I was really happy about that. He actually called me about 15 mins after I had gone into my room. I was still up actually...I wish I had checked the phone before I went to bed. I really wanted to talk to him about everything and find out if he talked to his ex about her nonsense. Ugh. That still makes me cringe. How crazy is she to think that he'll take her back? I mean, after all she's done. He better not succomb to her foolishness. She's like the predator, stalking her prey. I'm not feeling that behavior at all. I know I've done some stupid shit in the past. But I was in HIGH SCHOOL! I wasn't a fucking adult. I guess stupidity is ageless.

      Ok, so I talked to my ex today and guess what? His fuckin ex wants to remarry him! WTF!? Well he does not wanna marry her again ( THANK YOU JESUS! ), but I'm still a little bit afraid. I mean, this  IS the mother of his children. Ugh. This situation makes me so sick. WHY do I get involved w/ ppl like this? I mean, how the hell do I find these ppl w/ all this drama? I don't get it. Well it doesn't matter really b/c we're not together. HOWEVER... I miss him  a lot . And honestly, I wanna be w/ him again. Man, you don't even know how I feel right now. My heart almost lept outta my chest when he said that. I felt ok though when he started explaining all the reasons he does not want to marry her again. The only thing that got me, though, was that he said he was "flattered" by it. Flattered???? What the FUCK?! That was SO not what I wanted to hear. Even though he had a TON of reasons why he did not want to be with her again (and they were VERY good reasons. One being that he is not compatible with her. Uh, ya think!?), the flattered comment got to me. It made me feel like there is like a 1% chance they will get back together.   *sigh* I gotta be so honest. I gotta spill my guts on this. I love that man SO very much. Shit, I might even be IN love with him. Ok, this may sound cliche, but fuck it, it'll just sound cliche. I feel/felt like there's a  reason  that we should be together. I mean, I'm sure there are ppl out there that feel like they were meant to be w/ someone. If you've felt it, then you feel what I'm saying. If you haven't, well... I hope you feel it. There's nothing like it. I mean, damn. Have you ever got down on your knees and prayed..I mean REALLY prayed to the Lord (Jehovah, Allah, whoever!) and asked that they bring the person you loved into your life again? And asked that you be w/ that person forever? Goodness gracious, I've become a case...as in 'basket'. I didn't wanna be a case, but I'm a case through and through. It's SOOOOOOO hard to be strong, ya know? It's hard to just say "ok, well if it's meant to be, then it'll be", then just sit back and relax. Who the hell can relax when the person who could be THE ONE is...is... talking to their ex-wife about remarriage?    I think I'm gonna go and cry now...

      Ok, I went a little nuts on the  urlLink Quizilla  site. I was bored, so sue me! Anyway, I've got 3 more quizzes here. The first is about the type of kiss I have. Oh yea, that one came out  PERFECT !  *hehe*  The second one was about the type of affection I am, which came out good as well. And the last quiz was the type of soul I am. I agree wholeheartedly that I have a  beautiful  soul :) Enjoy!     You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.  Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       cuddle and a kiss on the forehead - you like to be close to your special someone and feel warm, comfortable, and needed    urlLink   What Sign of Affection Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You have a beautiful soul!

Everyone loves you and you love them back, with a lot of friends, and popularity. But you didnt get it because of your clothes-you got it because there seems to be a radiance around you, a sort of glow, that attracts people to do better and be better.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses?

      Today, I met up w/ my best friend from  7th grade . Yay! I haven't seen her in about a year and half. I absolutely love her to death. It was so funny how we haven't seen each other in SO long, yet we totally picked up right where we left off. It was fun getting together and catching up.  Of course we said that we weren't going to go that long again w/out seeing each other. But of course, we will! lol! That's ok if we do, we always seem to find each other again. Now that's friendship.   Then, oddly enough, my friend from college contacted me today as well. I haven't spoken to her in quite some time too. Unfortunately, I was with my best friend, so I couldn't talk long. But I'll have to give her a call tomorrow and catch w/ her. I've known her since my freshman yr in college...so for almost 8 years..... wow, has it really been that long?? Wow. Eight years is like forever. Well, my best friend and I have known each other for 14 yrs. Damn, now that's forever.     In my best Chandler Bing:   Could I  BE  any older!? LOL!

      Today I've been sorta bored. I went to the grocery store, which was good fun. I tried a different store this time. It was fun to go to a new environment. However, I felt so lost! I had no clue where anything was, of course. I'm so used to my usual store and just going straight to where I need to get stuff. So today, I spent a little more time finding all my items. It was cool though. A change of pace was good and it provided a little adventure as well.   Recent News:  My BEST friend just called me!! Well she called like 2 hrs ago! Yay! I haven't seen/talked to my best friend in like a year and a half! Isn't that horrible? I called her last weekend cuz I was in town for the 4th. So she just called and I'm so excited! I SO need to talk to her. I need to catch her up on everything... man, I miss her so much. She's so awesome. We've known each other since 7th grade. We try to keep in touch but it's hard b/c she works so much and all. Plus when I moved away for college, it made things even harder. But we always seem to get in contact with each other again. So I'm gonna go call her and catch up on things. It's been TOO long!

      I absolutely love this channel! I can watch this all day. It makes me feel like I can do anything. I mean, they make designing and decorating seem so freakin easy! Damn, I can't wait to move. I have so many great ideas for my new place. I hope to God I can move next year. I'm hoping that this whole condo thing will work out, that way I can paint and stuff. So fun!

      I'm  so  glad it's finally Friday! Not only is it Friday but it's PAY DAY! Wooo HOOOOO! Well that feeling won't be lasting for too long. I got like a million bills to pay. Fuck. That really toasts my cookies. *sigh* But what can I do? Gotta pay the bills.   So this weekend will be a pretty lifeless one, to say the least. I'll most definitely be working on my website. I need to do a lot on it b/c next week, my classes start up again. I'm pretty sure that I'll have  NO  time to work on my site. Therefore, I need to make major headway on this thing. I'm so excited about it though. I've been showing it off to some of my friends...so far so good! Lots of good comments thus far. That makes me happy and motivated to keep going with my work. I'm so excited about the possibilty of making more money!!! I hate to be so money driven, but man, life is hard right now. And a sista can definitely use the extra cash.   In other news...  I'm watching the news right now and they claim that the freakin Loch Ness monster has "relocated" to Michigan! Yes, to Michigan. Well, apparently, it's just some dork w/ a mechanical version. WTF? Don't people have stuff to do? Guess not.  I'm sorta wanting to see that movie  urlLink Anchorman . Why? I haven't the slightest clue. It sorta looks funny. I really like Will Ferrell. I LOVED his cheerleader character on  urlLink SNL . Man, I miss that skit. They should've passed the torch or something before him and Cheri O'Teri left.....nah, they were the best. No one can duplicate that. They kicked ass.

      I've mentioned I'm in a sorority, correct? Yes, I think I  urlLink have . We are supposed to be having a conference next month to discuss changes in our membership process. Jolly good time that will be. I'm sorta looking forward to it and then again, I'm sorta not. Ya know what? I'm becoming a hermit. I have become accustomed to being by myself these days. Lately, I really just want to be around like one or two people. I don't know why...just not in the mood to socialize with a whole lot of people. I know that sounds so bad of me...perhaps it's a phase. If so, it's been a long phase. Also, I think that being around all my sisters can get a little... well, hyperactive. Whenever we talk about business, it tends to get a little heated. It's all good though. I'm always up for a hearty debate. I guess I just have to get myself prepared for it. Psych myself up, if you will.    In other news...  I'm starving right now. I'm at work, pretty much just chilling. The summer time is awfully slow. I like this time, but it makes the day go by so slow. *twiddling thumbs*

       urlLink 20 Questions to a Better Personality   Wackiness: 50/100 Rationality: 50/100 Constructiveness: 86/100 Leadership: 30/100    You are an SECF--Sober Emotional Constructive Follower. This makes you a hippie. You are passionate about your causes and steadfast in your commitments. Once you've made up your mind, no one can convince you otherwise. Your politics are left-leaning, and your lifestyle choices decidedly temperate and chaste.  You do tremendous work when focused, but usually you operate somewhat distracted. You blow hot and cold, and while you normally endeavor on the side of goodness and truth, you have a massive mean streak which is not to be taken lightly. You don't get mad, you get even.  ***************************** How comical! It says that I pretty much have NO leadership skills (Leadership: 30/100). Well I guess when I think about it, I really prefer not to lead. Even though I prefer not to, I CAN lead if I need to. Shoo, I  was   the freakin' National President of my sorority. Aside from being fuckin' President of the United States, you can't get more leader-rific than that, ya know? HA! Oh well. Fun times.

      Alright, I changed the layout of my blog. The pink was just too...too...pink! Yuk, I hate pink. Why did I do that to myself? Everytime I looked at it, I just thought "Ew!" I like this layout better. I'm  lovin  the rounded corners. The blue, the green...yea, I'm feeling much better. Hope you enjoy it.   With the update, I've taken the liberty of adding in a section to add my fav links. Right now you see I have the MTV link. I know some ppl feel that MTV is crap. Yes, it is. I agree. But ya know what? It's crap that I enjoy. Why? I dunno for sure. I just like it. I watch it a lot. Yes, my head is turning to mush. It's sad. Well, at least I admit it. I'll add some others a little later. I need to think about it a little. Oh, I know I'll definitely be adding the HGTV link in there. I LOVE that channel! Sorry but I'm totally in this creative, decorative mode. I think I'll be like this until I move. So yes, HGTV will most definitely be a link.    In other news...  The ex and I chatted for about 30 min on the phone on Monday. Hmm, it was interesting. So interesting, it's not even worth mentioning. mmmhmm, riiiight. We have also been talking more on email. We haven't been talking about anything of significance. Just saying "hey" or "how's your day". *sigh*  What  ever.

      Meaning? It's almost time for me to get off work! Yip-pee! It's been a long ass day. And the sad part is that I didn't get in today until 10. I was so tired this morning that I had to call in. I slept for another hour and then dragged myself to work. I'm so ready to get a new job it's not even funny. Work relations have been stable though. Not too annoyed w/ my coworkers lately. So that's definitely a plus.   We're in the midst of freshman orientation here and it's just pure ridiculousness. These "kids"...where the hell do they get these manners? I am pretty sure I wasn't obnoxious at this age. These kids are crazy! So obnoxious. SO rude! Where's the home training people? It's so non-existent. I mean, not all of them are like that, but they are definitely out there. They sorta make me not want kids. Of course, if I did have kids, they would be WELL trained. My mom didn't play when I was younger. I was definitely in for a verbal beat down if I got outta line. Nope, she wasn't having it. I won't either if I become a mom.   Ok, time to start closing down shop. Adios!

      have a song stuck in your head and it just won't go ahead? Ugh, I have that Alicia Keys song "If I Ain't Got You" (I think that's the name) in my head. I've been humming it ALLLLL day! Damn Alicia, go away!  Uneventful day today. Just work and crap. I should've worked on our office site, but no one has really given me any feedback. So I really don't have anything to do on it. I do need to fix up a few things on it though... neh, I'll get to it tomorrow.  I'm gonna try and attempt to get some ice cream today.  urlLink Cold Stone Creamery  is supposed to be the greatest ice cream EVER! Well, apparently so...every time I go, the freakin line is out the door! Geez, can a sista get a cone!? Ok, so I'll try again for the  third  time to get some. I'll let ya know how it is. For now, take a look at the website and drool (I guarantee you will drool).    Updated:   I FINALLY got some CSC! Woo-Hoo!!! It was SO DAMN GOOD! If you've a CSC in your area, GO! RUN! Sooooo worth it!

      The 4th used to be a real fun time for me. It meant food, fireworks and fam. Now it's sorta like ... Riiiight. Sorta dead. I will be going home though tomorrow to hang w/ the family. My mom and sis are supposed to be cooking tons 'o food. YUM! Nothing like homecooking. Can't wait.  Today though, I'll be hanging at the crib. Chillin. Working on the biz. I NEED to clean out my room. It has grown into this large...messy...blob. It's not cute. Frankly, I'm ashamed that it's my room. I should really clean it. Buuuuut guess what? I'm not (HA!) Yup, call me Ms. L-A-Z-Y! Woohoo! Nah, maybe I'll clean it....maybe.   Happy 4th!

      Well I suspect a few more visitors will be coming to my blog as I just posted the link to my blog in my AIM profile. Cool beans. Welcome to my world. It's slightly boring, but I try to make it entertaining. Just to warn everyone though, I tend to write like I'm writing in a diary. Now that may or may not interest you. Frankly I don't care. lol! I mean, you don't have to read this. Simply click your 'Back' button and return to your regularly scheduled programming. Or hey, keep reading. Why not? Can't hurt, right? So anyway, welcome!  Today I'm working on my business. It's been going ok, but I've been having a hard time staying focused. I need to do some more computer research and stuff, but it's a challenge. I don't have a desk. So I'm in an awkward state here trying to get my work done. Well one things for sure. I will be buying a desk w/ my first paycheck I get from my business. Hopefully, I can get it before that. Ya know what? I just realized something. I have a freakin deadline!!! OMG. Damn. I need to be up and running by Aug 1st. Hmmm. Ok, I need to go work.  peace

      I'm still thinking of the dream, but watching Conan is doing the trick sorta. But dude, I'm madd sleepy and sorta don't want to go to bed. Oh, looks like Conan is showing a repeat anyway. Kwame Jackson from The Apprentice is on there. I seen this one. I liked little Kwame. Too bad he didn't win. But I liked that Bill (?) guy too.   So that Cingular commercial just came on w/ the girl who has the number 867-5309...ya know, the song. Hmm, wonder does anyone really have that number. How COOL would that be??? I want that number.   Damn, I'm tired as hell. I need to go to sleep...totally rambling on right now.

      I had this dream today. I dreamt about my sister that passed away about a few years ago. I am really scared right now. It started off as a pleasant dream but ended a little...scary. She wasn't scary but what happened was. I don't wanna describe it. But it's definitely in my head. I need to read the Bible...  Ok I read these two Psalms that my mom suggested to ease my mind. I'm not eased. I'm just....scared. It isn't a bad scared. It's more of a, hmm, why did this happen type scared. I just wanna know what the meaning is behind this dream. *shivers*

      I'll do my homework as soooooon as I blog this.  #1. Have you all seen this new LL Cool J video?? What is really really going on? How does this man look  impeccable  at like the age of 40-something?? How?  HOW !? Omg...'scuse me while I swoon!!  *wooooooo*  This negro looks like he's damn 20 yrs old! WTF. For real LL? For real? All I gotta say is DAYUM! Isn't he divorced now? Ok ok lemme stop spreading rumors.  Is he? Ok ok ok I quit!  #2. Why are there stupid people? Why? Why? Ok, they're not stupid. But they do stupid things. Why? Why? Why don't ppl make sense? Is this something that God gave us just to confuse the ppl that do smart things? I don't get it. Why can't ppl see when they do stupid stuff? Ok, let me clarify. Hmm, ok, you ever been in a situation where it was just SO obvious to NOT do something stupid? But for some reason, there's someone involved in that situation that just does the stupid thing that is SO obvious not to do? Follow me? Probably not. Ok, I can't explain this situation very well...just go w/ me anyway. I'm just saying. People need to THINK before they do shit. That's all I gotta say.  #3. Why can't we all just get along? Ok, yea that was a lame line coined by Rodney King, but for real. Why? Why? Why? I'm just saying, is it that hard? Why do we have to make shit that's soooo easy, sooooo fuckin' hard? Why? Why? Why? Damn, I'm starting to feel like Jadakiss now. Movin on.  #4. Who (gotcha! it's not a 'why' question) the hell hired AJ back on 106 & Park? Do we really like him? Is he really that cool? And so I'm watching it and Free isn't on here. Hmm, is she like refusing to host w/ him? I'm being all nosy about this, but I'm just wondering. They made it seem like the negro went and damn... I don't know, killed somebody! I mean, I guess it's unclear whether he quit or got fired. Whatever. Back to my point--who the hell brought his lame ass back!? Ugh. I did  NOT  miss seeing them ugly ass braids!!! Gross! Damn, don't he read his hate mail?? I KNOW somebody has had to have emailed this boy, sent a letter, called his two-way, etc, etc saying "GET RID OF THEM BRAIDS!" They are super NOT cute. Anyway, movin on...  #5. I'm notoriously late on stuff. I like it that way though. So I just DL'd John Mayer. If you don't know who he is, get to know him. He's a cool ass white boy. Go download him... go now. I got his second CD. It's damn good. He's an "emo". If you don't know what that is, well neither did I til about 3 days ago. Apparently, he's a guy who's into singing about his feelings. I guess he's a Brian McKnight, Maxwell, Eric Benet type cat. Except he's white. I'm sure you know who he is. He's been out forever (remember, I'm late) Anyway, go get get him. Go now. It's tight. It's kinda blues-y, kinda jazzy...tight. It's definitely chill music.  Damn, I had something else to say and I completely forgot! I hate that. Ok, I'll come back later if I remember. Aight, chat amongst yourselves. I've given you a lot to think about for now ;-)

      Do you all know about this? I mean, of course you do. I forgot, I'm notoriously late on like everything. That's ok, I like it that way =) Ok, so yea I decided to take a look at it. They offer a 7-day free trial thing. Then if you want, you can get automatically bumped up to the Premium service for $9.95/mth. Ok. So. I did this free trial thing. Then, I got bumped to the Prem service. Is it just me, or is there NO difference?! Am I missing something? The Prem serv says you can get unlimited downloads for $9.95/month. I'm thinking, COOL, I'm gonna DL my little heart out for $10 a month! But oh no. That's not how it works. The Prem service allows you the ability to message other DLing fools about whatever and it allows you to DL unlimited # of tracks and albums. You  still  have to pay  additional  money to actually DL songs!! Damn these ppl! Needless to say, I cancelled the Prem service w/ the quickness. However, the flip side is that you can still DL stuff from Napster w/out paying the monthly fee. You just pay as you go. Cool. I can deal with that. You can get some albums (actually a lot of albums) for $10. So I got the Black Eyed Peas (great CD so far, by the way). I also DL'd....ummm, should I reveal this? I know folks are gonna be like, what the hell were you thinking if I say who else I DL'd. Ok ok, I got  Ashlee Simpson . But I think it's good! Hey the girl did go platinum in less than a week. So someone likes her! Ok, whatever. Sue me :-P She has this sorta Courtney Love vibe on some of her songs, which I don't like too much. It sounds like she's off key. But it's not terribly bad. Ok, whatever. I like it.  If anyone knows where I can pay a monthly fee for unlimited songs, like for real unlimited songs, holla.

      I feel like I have titled a post "Occupied" before. If so, let this be Occupied, part 2. If not, just carry on as if I said nothing.  Well, today I'm feeling occupied...or pre-occupied rather. I have SO much to do! It's absolutely ridiculous. I wish I could take a week off from work and take care of my business. *sigh* And I've been so tired lately, I just wanna sleep. This weekend didn't help me either b/c I was up late the entire time. It's all good though...all for a good cause. I have been swamped at work creating this website to help train new staff. I've been working all day, every day on it for the past two weeks. I can't wait until it's really done. Right now, it's in the review phase. I picked several co-workers to take a look at the site and give feedback on it. I'm a little nervous, but I'm pretty confident that everyone will like it.  On top of work stuff, I need to do my homework for my classes. I'm behind. Yes, I admit that I'm the world's biggest procrastinator. I guess I would be on top of things if I weren't trying to do other things right now. I just can't focus! I really hate that. I just need to relax. I need to write down all my assignments. Turn on some good music and just get the work done. Thank God, this is our reading week for school. So I don't have class and I don't have to post on our dumb message boards. I can take this time to catch up and hopefully get ahead w/ my assignments.  I got my midterm grades and they aren't good right now. But that's just an estimate, just to give us an idea. So although my grades are not anything to boast about right now, I know that I can get myself together to get them up to par.     Crush Report...   I  urlLink mentioned  a while back that I am crushing on like 6 ppl right now. Well, add one more to the list! Oh yea baby! =)  Let the games begin! Just kidding :-P But yea, my crushes are fun times. I think I need to go through and maybe narrow things down a bit. Hmm, actually, let's see... ok, I think I'm gonna cut 3 ppl, so I'm down to 4. :) hehe   Other stuff...  Soooo Taye Diggs is going to have his own tv drama. SWEET! I think Taye is a good actor. I like him a lot. It's a little weird that he's gonna be on tv, but it's all good. I guess he has to get work some way. Lord knows the brotha ain't been in a movie in a while. Along the same lines, Vivica Fox is also on a tv show. Hmm, I guess times are tough for our actors?  So, I'm watching this show called  urlLink The Player  on UPN. Why is it sorta interesting? I mean, it's just another reality show, right? But #1, there are a few cuties on it :) #2, the girl who the guys are trying to play is not ditzy or dumb at all. She's actually the player, so she apparently has some active brain waves going on upstairs. So the object is for the guys to play her or get played by her. I kinda like this dynamic. I swear, one could do a thesis on the art of being a playa. So I think this show might be my new guilty pleasure. Besides,  nothing  comes on on Tuesdays!  Alright, enuff of my babbling. I'm gonna attempt do to hw. haha, yea let's see if this actually happens. ciao bellas!

      Well the weekend is coming to a close. As I mentioned before, my sorority had a conference this weekend. It was really great seeing so many sisters together and getting a chance to meet new sisters, etc. I had a really fun time. We all went to this club last night and had a great time. The conference was also great. It's always nice to see and learn how the org is progressing. The weekend is really making me ready for our next National conference.  It will be so nice to be on the other side of things this time around. For the past 2 conferences that I've been to, I've been on the planning side of it all. So next year will be great b/c I can just relax and have fun. yay!  Anyway, I'm so exhausted! And of course I have a TON of homework to do! I'm really not feeling it but I gotta get it done. I need to check and see if this week is our reading week. I hope it is b/c that means I don't have class AND I can catch up this entire week. Sweet. I have like 2-3 hw assignments to makeup *sigh*... it just never ends.  I would write more but I think I'm gonna take a quick nap. ciao!

      It's such a beautiful day today. The wind is blowin' through my apt and it's feeling quite nice right now. I feel like taking a road trip somewhere. But possibly, taking it by myself. I feel like going to Canada. I don't know why. I haven't been in a while. The last time I went was probably last summer, before J moved over here. I loved going to visit him. Even though Windsor is like a hop, skip and a jump away, it always felt like a mini-vacation to me. His apt had a view of the Detroit River. Oh my God, it was so wonderful! We'd just sit in his dining room and look out the picture window at the Detroit skyline. *sigh* Good times.  So tomorrow is payday (hallelujah!) It's been a truly stressful week trying to nickel and dime my way through. But it is finally here and I can take care of my business.   This weekend is my sorority conference. I have some sisters staying w/ me from the MD/VA area. So I'll have a lot going on this weekend, but it should be fun. I'm excited though b/c two of my fav sorors will be staying w/ me.  I keep in touch w/ one like everyday, so we're pretty caught up w/ each other.  Anyway, I'm excited but I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow before they get here. I'm taking a half day at work tomorrow and I'm going to visit my dad for his b-day. I bought him this Michigan jacket that he wanted. I need to get a card though. So I'll go to the D, chill w/ him and my mom for a bit then head back. I've been cleaning my apt like a madd woman for the past few days, trying to clear out all the stuff I cleaned out of my closets. My friend came by yesterday to help me take stuff to the Salvation Army. That was a huge load off my shoulders. I had like 10 bags of stuff! *phew!* We got that done and then I had some papers to take to work to shred. And that was pretty much it! My apt is so bare now, it looks like I'm getting ready to move :) It'll be tight though b/c if I do end up moving next fall, it'll be a WHOLE lot easier w/out all that extra shit I had.  Well hw is calling my name...

      Job huntin', that is. So a couple of my co-workers have alerted me to a new job opening at the U. It seems alright, but I'm not sure if it's a place I'd really like to work. The benefits of the job would be amazing though. First off, bigger salary (Oh yea!). Second, it's a 9-mth position w/ seasonal leave during the summer (HELL YEA! Summers off!). Third, it's only 30 hours a week. Now, the last part sounds good, but only if the pay is tight. So yea, I'm all for the perks. However, it's in a dept that I'm not sure I could see myself in. I mean, I'm sure it won't be bad. It's a more independent job, so not a lot of supervision, which is good. Especially if the other ppl there aren't that great. But who knows, they might be just as fun as my current job. So I think I'm gonna do a little more research about the job and see if I can possibly b.s. my way through a cover letter :-P  In other news... Kinda tired today. Wanna take a nap. BUT, I have madd hw to do. I'm such a slacker! I am a week behind. However, it's not that bad b/c our reading week is coming up. Which means I get to try and catch up! yay!  What else? I had some good email convo today. :)  aaaand, I think that's about it. ciao!

      My parents and sister came to visit me today. My mom, sis and I went to dinner while my dad stayed at my place and watched the baseball game (he had already eaten). So we're at dinner, just the girls and we started talking about my relationship w/ J. Ok, not bad...at first. After I say to them that we're no longer dating, they began giving me their "more experienced" advice on men. First of all, I'm 25, not 15. Second, while I appreciate the concern, I am more than capable of being aware of the men I date. I know that, unfortunately, there are some men out there that aren't so great. Yes, there are some bad seeds out there that try to play like they are Mr. Suave &amp; Smooth. Yes, I know all of this. And I proceed to tell them this b/c I was sick of doing the whole smile and nod thing. So I politely told them that I am more alert and aware than they know. I read the papers. I watch the news. I know what is going on. In fact, I feel like I know  too  much. I'm at a point in life where I should really be going out, enjoying myself, meeting ppl, etc. However, I'm not. And why not? Well b/c of all the weirdos out there, that's why! I am trying to be careful. I do not wanna end up in some domestic violence case. I don't want to be w/ someone who will do nothing but lie to me. And I don't want someone who will cheat on me (and I've actually been there, done that w/ my first boyfriend). The list goes on in terms of what I have to be careful of, but I'm aware of all the things that go down these days. It's tough finding the right one. I told them flat out that it will be a long time before I settle down w/ someone b/c I'm picky and I'm also trying to watch my back.  Shit, that Forrest Gump was right. Life  is  like a box of chocolates. And when it comes to dating, you never know what you're gonna get.

      Here's the rundown of today:  I continued cleaning my apt and I have made tremendous progress. I moved my futon into my bedroom (don't ask how the hell I did it... let's just say it wasn't easy though). I moved my papasan (sp?) into the living room (again). I bagged up the rest of my clothes which brings my Salvation Army donation total up to  10  bags (clothes and shoes). phew! I can't believe I've been holding all those old things hostage for all these years! Feels good to get rid of it all. What else? I haven't actually  cleaned  the apt, but that will come this Wed or Thurs. I want to wait so that I don't dirty it up again (I have sorors coming this weekend for our conference). Yea, so my apt is looking pretty sweet right now...just gotta get the bags of clothes and trash (old papers, etc) out to their respective containers.  I went to see  I, Robot .  GOOD  movie! Hightly enjoyable. I recommend it. I think you might have to like that techie type stuff though to fully give a rat's tail about it. Hmm, not techie stuff, but futuristic type stuff...yea that's better. You gotta like or at least be curious about futuristic technology to really get into it; at least that's what I feel. But perhaps if you're a big Will Smith fan, you'll like it just the same.     *sidebar*  Ladies, Will Smith=  HOT    in this movie !  *end sidebar*   I'm currently watching West Wing reruns. I'm not a WW fan, but it's sorta interesting. Wish I had gotten into it when it first came out. Reruns are pretty good though.  Alright, nighty night time Ciao!
