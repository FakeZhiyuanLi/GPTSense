      Declaration is something too big, isn't it? Especially when I'm going to talk about that of my life. I love simplicity. Therefore, what I want to communicate now is so simple - what I passonately believe which will lead me to a meaningful existence as a human being in this beautiful world.  1)   If you don't believe in yourself, who will?   I have been so sad for years - precisely, the whole of my teen and undergraduate time - why I'm not born with a good brain and good communication skills as my close friends who are always being complimented and admired as damn smart, nice and lovely people. In my eyes, they are so tatented, energetic, quick-mind, cheerful, outgoing, wise and so on. They are able to undertand and solve problems in a minute while I even didn't have enough time to recognize what the issues are. They are able to tell interesting stories, attract others with their charisma and even manage people to do what they want! For me, whenever I achieve something, people always say that...oh Phi, you are so lucky! I hate being complemented like that. I want to be like my friends. I'm sure you know the disapointment, sadness and even distrust in my own ability I have suffered. One nice morning, I got up, had breakfast and went to school by bus as usual. On the bus, I was struck by the thoughts that...oh...I know by now, I'm like a turtle in the race with the rabbit in the traditional tale that people know. The mysterial problem is answered now. I'm not born with favourable skills and talent but I have the determination and passion for achivement. I'm a normal person with good mental abiilty and nice appearance. I feel thankful for being a person with all the necessary resources. What I have to do, in the race against the smart and quick rabbit, is to run - determinedly, relentlessly and passionately towards the destionation. I just can't demand people to see me like a smart, outgoing and charismatic rabbit. No, I'm not. I'm a lovely, but full of passion, turtle. I believe in my victory 5010% percent. When I believe, then nothing can stand in my way.  2)   Self-actualization desire  . Someone probably may ask me: "Why do you want to pursue an entrepreneurial life? It is full of ups and downs. I don't think it is a wise idea, Phi". Probably, he/she is right. I may not be successful like Bill Gates, Starbucks Coffee's owner or the like. But the overall objectives for my hard-working life is not for money or fame but: - to fulfill my self-actualization, i.e. compete with my potential capabilities, don't necessarily compare with others' success. If anyone is successful, I'm (or trying to) happy for them. - to challenge myself, create a meaning of my life - to create wealth for the society, good jobs and opportunitites for development for my employees - to become a beautiful person in the next life, which is perceived as the rewards for beautiful things I have contributed to life, people and society so far.  With these credos in mind, I believe I would atract alike minds to work with me in my future company. It would be great!  I don't find a single similarity between myself and Bill Gates. But I have a desire to have some good thing like him. Therefore, I would try to see the world under his oyster, and lead the life which reflects the good things he do such as being sharing love and wealth to poor people, creating wealth for the society, leading a happy and simple life, earning money not for selfish use but for the contribution - to give.

        MANAGEMENT DEFINITIONS OF THE FUTURE

      My priorities would be:  First, sharing leadership. I agree with Goldsmith and Marshall that this is a requirement, not an option. I view this quality as an internal resource of a future leader.  Second, demonstrating technological savvy. As technologies are playing very important roles in our life like Internet, CRM systems of supermarkts, e-government and so on, an ability to use those tools as a competitive advantage is also crucial to a leader.  Thirdly, think globally. The world is getting smaller for people now can build up relationship, do business without leaving home or their own countries. The world will be the common market for its global citizens.  Fourth, building partnerships and alliances. It is important to make strategic alliances or partnerships because small companies will not be able to survive in future economical environment. This action is probably a must.  Finally, appreciating cultural diversity. Obviously, talent people are the most valuable asset of the company. Future leaders need to take advantage of this labor force without any biases.

      (a) How good were his forecast? In 'Preparing future leaders', James Hayes predicted young leaders of 2005 would be well-educated, well-prepared, eager for responsibilities and have a "can-do" attitude. For me, he is right to forecast those qualities. Young business people today are well-armed with a huge amount of information and management knowledge inherited from the forebears, a basis of high technology like Internet, and an excellent education systems. An iconic symbol of this is Dominic McVey, awarded Pioneer for Entrepreneurism by the Queen of United Kingdom, who became billionaire at the age of 15 and mostly uses his mobile phones and laptop to do business (Business Week, Special Edition Fashion Week, Spring 2004). However, I also agree that young business todays have the instinct of success and the touch of leadership. It is because they were educated and have learnt hard role models of successful pioneering business executives. However, I don't agree with Hayes on the point that education should not teach young managers his or her skills and those skills only be achieved through practice. Probably Hayes didn't regconize the importance of mentoring/training in improving business skills. I believe skills can be improved in an educational environment, through books and training to a certain level, which could save a lot of efforts of the manager-learner. In order to fully develop and sustain the skills in the long run, young managers have to continuosly practice them and to be exposed to challenging business environment.  (b) In particular, was he right to lay such an emphasis on practice as in music and sports? I passionately believe that only by practicing, managerial skills can be developed. Without practising, nobody can acquire those skills though he/she knows immense knowledge on how-to. I totally agree with Hayes when he emphasized the hard-working and persistence of musicians and atheletics in order to reach the peak of art-perfoming. It is because management, in the same way, is also an art in which managers are the artists.  (c) My forecast for management in 2014 and 2024.I think in the future, the competition will be more intense. The winning companies will be those who are big, strong, flexible and innovative. Leadership will become something people possess due to good education and the development of people in the world as a whole.

      In my opinion, the prediction of Pollard on the future of business is very interesting and persuasive for three reasons: Firstly, Pollard has pointed out correctly elements of our present economy such as intellectual assets and brands as critical competitive advantage, outsourcing as hot topics and so on. On that basis, he has used argumentative and acceptable rationales to lead into a picture of 2015.Secondly, in the implications of his prediction to our careers in future business, Pollard provided very useful, down-to-earth and feasible advice. I think those implications can be applied even at this moment, not in the future.Thirdly, he concluded that 'it is always fun to predict the future'. I agree with him that any predictions will be fun and beneficial because it reflects the way people see how the world will change in the future. It provide people with another point of view in front of the same thing.However, I think his writing will be more convincing if he could give examples and make his research more rigorously. From my point of view, if the world turns out like that, I can see probably this is the picture of the world, especially of developed countries like the U.S or U.K, not my country. Though Vietnam is now one of the fastest growth countries in the world, it has to take dozens dozens of years hard working in order to have bright vision like the prediction of Pollard.

      In 'Seekers and Scalers: The Future Leaders' (Training & Development, 1997), Randall White listed six scales of leadership development: couch potatoes, spectators, passengers, travellers, explorers and adventurers. On that basis, I position myself in the middle of transforming from a passenger to a traveler.Being a traveller, I possess a risk-taking and can-do attitude. During my working with Ernst &amp; Young Vietnam as a Recruitment Consultant, I always thought to myself that 'nothing is impossible' to self-motivate and sustain confidence. I used to be exposed to circumstances which I had to choose either happily accepting more responsibilities and perform the job that I had never experienced before or jeopardizing losing my job. I decided to take risks with a 'can-do' attitude. I also learnt that mistakes/failures are as equally important as success from my Senior Manager. I was trained the attitude of not fear for mistakes. Likewise, I am fully aware that difficult-learning would create a sustainable advantage against others as well. I studied Japanese at the age of fifteen when Japanese was perceived one of the most difficult languages in Asia or even in the world. My hope was to easily win a scholarship to go to Japan when competition was low as not many Vietnamese could master its language. One more thing, I'm always on the move of seeking and creating new opportunities with a strong ambition and a well-planned direction.However, I'm so far still a passenger and haven't fully developed to be a traveler. It is because I haven't proactively exposed myself to new experiences. Sometimes, I am afraid of uncertainty and prefer safety to risk as I tend to be perfectionist. I recognize the importance of difficult-learning and that 'easy solutions are fool's gold' but I at times give up in the middle of action. I have a clear direction where to go but for now and then I'm very confused with new factors happening on the way. Last but not least, at crucial moments, I often lose the trust in my ability. For those reasons, I think I haven't reached the level of travellers.I think I have gone half of the road on the exploration to leadership when I know my strengths and weaknesses and where I position in the exploration scale. The only action I have to do is to practice, practice and practice the skills of a traveller to make them mine.

      ABOUT THE SPEAKER  Rohit Talwar is currently CEO of FastFutureIn his lecture, Rohit discussed about the issues and emerging trends in the global such as poverty, politics, globalization, business outsourcing and offshoring, energy, celebrity culture and so on. Actually, I reckon it is impossible to talk about such a huge topic in about half an hour and thus many intersting contents/ ideas are probably missed out or skipped due to time constraints. For that reason, the talk just gives a very general overview on what will shapes the world in the future.  Link:  urlLink http://www.fastfuture.com   LESSONS FOR MYSELF AS A FUTURE MANAGER from his speech:  The importance of understanding the future trends. I was very impressed by the business of FastFuture, which is about forecasting global trends. More suprisingly, in Rohit's clients list, there are many multinational companies in many sectors and industries, even British government. Therefore, more than ever before, I have truly recognized the importance of understanding what is happening now and what will happen in the next 10 / 20/ or 30 years. Like the advice of Al Ries and Trout (ref. 1) ' as the world changes, you've got to reposition yourself againt the future', I should pay more attention on this interesting issue in order to stay ahead of the curve of change.

      ABOUT THE SPEAKER  Tom Ilube is currently Chief Technology Officer of Egg Bank.He has so far been my most favourite guest speaker of the whole course. I was very much impressed with the friendly manner he appeared on the stage though he is a Chief Officer of a bank. He used his warm and rhythmic voice to deliver an interesting talk. His experience sharings were very down-to-earth and specific, especially different from other guest speakers who just give general and theoretical ones. He answered any single questions thoroughly and satisfactorily. That is what I learnt from his style. I decided my keywords for my future talks would be: down-to-earth idea, thorough and satisfactory answer, voice, conviction.  Links: 1.  urlLink http://new.egg.com  2.  urlLink http://www.computerweekly.com/articles/article.asp?liArticleID=127909&liFlavourID=1&amp;sp=1   LESSONS FOR MYSELF AS A FUTURE MANAGER from his speech  1. Self-awareness. Tom emphasized the importance of self-awaness straight from the beginning of his speech. I totally agree with his point. I reckon to be a good manager, we should understand our strengths and weaknesses, what we are good and and what we are bad at in order to strategically plan our actions. I also share the same belief of Peter Drucker in Managing Oneself that a sound understanding of ourselves will lead us to success in management and even in our daily life.  2. Alignment vs. agreement. This is such a practical tactics that I gained from Tom. In management life, it often happens that some of team members don't totally agree with the direction of the whole team or the leader. What should the manager do? Would he spend time to persuade those? In reality, it is not easy to get through the situation with assertiveness. Tom suggested that manager should express the attitude towards to those who don't agree that he spent time thinking about their opinions and appreciated those but he decided to go ahead his way: 'I understand that you don't agree, can you align to this direction?' I perceive this tactics would help managers shows interest in the opinions/feelings of his subordinates but still move on with his judgement and decision assertively.  3. Fast cycles of changes. It is predicted that cycles of changes would be faster and faster in the future. Managers should be persistent and keep moving on to proactively manage changes and gain success.  4. Networking. I am an introvert person and have problems with my networking all the times because I perfer being on my own to read or chitchat with my best friends to participating in a funky parties. I always feel annoyed with going out and socilizing which is very often and essential in business. Tom pointed out that networking is not all about quantities but a about quality of relationships. His networking is just 10 persons but those are the ones he could ask for help in any circumstances and they are the hub of many other networking. I find his tactics valuable to me and particularly for those who are introvert.I have learnt that networking is very much important in business. Each type of persons will have their own way of making and maintaining networking.  REFERENCES  1. Drucker, P. (1999) Managing Oneself, Harvard Business Review, Mar/Apr 1999, Vol 77, Issue 2, pp64

      ABOUT THE SPEAKER  Rene Carayol is currently a management presenter.In my opinion, Rene's presentation was perfect. He pronounced clearly every single words and delievered his speech with well-chosen words. He gave many examples for each ideas so that the audience could capture the whole meaning of his speech. Though the contents of what Rene presented is not new to me because they are all written in the books of management gurus which I have read (see references), I love the way he made his speech which is inspiring and clearly understandable. The keywords for my learning: It doesn't matter what you present but it really matters HOW you present it.  Link:  urlLink www.carayol.com   LESSONS FOR MYSELF AS A FUTURE MANAGER from his speech:  1. The difference between management and leadership. I do agree that manager is good at coping with complexity and leader is good at coping with change. To put it more specific, manager brings a degree of order and consistency to companies tending to become chaotic by planning, organizing, controlling, staffing, budgeting, problem solving while leader sees the 'unseen', sets a direction, develops a vision which is very different from the status quo, aligns, motivates, and inspires people to understand the vision and committed to its achievements.I believe, in order to be a good CEO or the like, he/she must balance between being a good manager and a good leader. A good leader without good management skills will not make any good sense and vice versa.  2. Is a leader inborn or educated? Rene is unsure about that. He accepts the fact that leader is scare. For me, I passionately believe that leadership can be educated. Everyone has leadership potential inside but not many people know how to bring it out and develop it. I agree that to be a great business leader, it needs a genious, but to be a leader in terms of a family, group of people, a business department or a small community, anyone with a strong determination and learning ability can do it well. With such a belief, I am really motivated to take the lead in any circumstances if possible and vision myself as a manager in a near future.  3. Qualities of a leader. Rene listed three qualities of great leaders: (1) love people, (2) be optimistic, (3) be clear what he/she stands forI'm not sure what he meant by loving people. I think I need more time to think or even experience to fully get what I should do to develop this quality. Rene related this with an example of Sir John Stevens - London Metropolitant Police Commissioner, who put people before procedures, decided promotion in just 1 minutes only by hearing his surbordinates arguments. I don't think I'm this sort of people.However, I love his idea that leader is very much optimistic. I could relate this with another example which I got from Ray Meyer, a college basketball coach in the United States, who led DePaul University to forty-two consecutive years of winning seasons. When his team dropped its first game after twenty-nine straight home court victories, he was interviewed to see how he felt about it. He responded: "Great! Now we can start concentrating on winning, not on losing". (Bennis, 1985, pp: 71). I think of this story all the time when I begin seeing things dark or being permistic. It's another way I motivate myself.For the third point regarding positioning, I do agree that leader needs to clarify what he stands for, where he is his position in the organization and where the organization positions in terms of others. By doing that, leader will gain trust of his followers and be able to motivate them to achieve the vision he is directing at.  REFERENCES  1. Bennis W., Nanus B. (1985) Leaders - The Strategies For Taking Charge, (New York: Harper &amp; Row Publishers) 2. Edited by Syrett M., Hogg C.

      ABOUT THE SPEAKER  Victoria Ward is currently Director of Spark Knowledge. She appeared in a casual but lovely outfit which made me feel that she was very close to us and 'just-like-us (students)'. She always smiled and made eye contact to everyone in the audience. She gave me an impression that she was ready to share every single thoughts in her mind any experience she gained in an open and ethusiastic but professional manner. Actually, she tried to make an emotional connection between her and us and she was successful. I, therefore, really like her presentation style as I reckon to deliver a speech is easy, but to make the speeck go into the heart of the audience is difficult. Victora was fantastic when she threw away the barrier of seniority (CEO and students) to share knowledge just like friend-to-friend. Moreover, she made sure that her answers were satisfied to us all the times. I love her style and manner expressed in the day. I noted down the keywords for my future presentation: smiles, eye contact, openness, enthusiasm, emotional connection and 'fit-to-audience' (tailoring the style to particular audience).  Link:  urlLink http://spark.spanner.org/   LESSONS FOR MYSELF AS A FUTURE MANAGER from her speech  1. 'Open-minded' design and space in the workplace. This is the first time I have recognized the importance of the office design and space arrangement. According to Victoria, it could enhance collaboration among employees and boost the control and efficiency. I totally agree with her on this point. Though, I still think that to apply knowledge management to an organization in this way would cost a fortune paid for designers. As a manager, I prefer to manage my own office in a way that doesn't cost too much and save money to the business. Money should work hard to make more money!  2. Slowness in personal relationships. I reckon it is important for us to nurture our relationship with others, to spend time and efforts on understanding their personalities, feelings and the like. According to a management guru, a successful manager is an interesting one who is interested in people. Then, slowness in our daily contact will make sure that we show our interestes in others, build the relationships stronger (which is a very essential skill: relationship-building) and more importantly, to gain more tacit/explicit knowledge that probably shared during our interactive. However, I still chew in mind one question that needs answering: What are the techniques to be effectively slow in relationships? Do we have enough attention to pay while we are working an extremely busy and stressful day?  3. Knowledge management is increasingly important in organizations. In other words, in future, managers will pay more attention on creating a learning organization.  4. 'Knowledage' questions. Victoria put forward a very interesting quesion on how to put questions and gain knowledge. I agree that people normally ask general questions, so why don't we change the questions to HOW yoo do it? With this way, I believe managers will get more knowledge/information beyond their expectation.  5. A small issue to think: how to make people to realize or value their experience and being share experience? I actually don't know.  REFERENCES  1. Drucker, P.
