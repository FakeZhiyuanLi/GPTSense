        Last night I had my massage.  It was wonderful, my back and shoulders were so tight and tense.  I'm sore today, but that'll pass.  I felt like jello afterwards last night.  I needed it so bad!  I'm going to start going once a month.  Now that I'll only have one class it'll be easier to do that.  I just got my results from my history final.  I got an A-!!!!  I got a B for the class!  So I got a B and an A this past session!  That's not bad for working full-time and taking two classes, and trying to help build the house with Ken!  I'm so proud of myself!  I am alot smarter than I thought I was, I'm definitely getting more confident with these good grades I'm getting!  Go Me!!  I leave work today at 3pm, and my parents and I are heading to the beach.  It might rain tomorrow (which stinks cuz that's our full beach day), but it's just so nice to get away from everything and relax.  I won't have to do any homework (like the past 8 weeks), I won't have to help with the house, or do any cleaning - just relax!  Hopefully I'll remember how to do that!  Have a great weekend everyone!  Oh - btw - settlement is this upcoming Tuesday!  Ken is moving in next weekend!  I can't believe the house is done!!  I'll have more updated pictures on my website (and some of NY too) as soon as we get my parents monitor back from the shop (maybe another week or two).  Bye!!! :) :)

        I am happy.  Last night was the last class of "Western Civilization since 1600 A.D."  My next class "Philisophical Thinking" starts Tuesday.  It's nice because I'll only be taking one class as opposed to two.  I'll actually have a little bit more of a life.  I miss that.  Tonight I'm going to get a deep-tissue massage ( VERY  much needed).  And tomorrow I leave work early because I'm going with my parents to New York to visit friends at Rockaway Beach in Queens.  It'll be  SOOOOO  nice to get away.  I haven't gone anywhere since the weekend of May 21st (for a friend's wedding in Delaware).  I really need to get away.  I've been so stressed, I'm actually going to the doctor's next week to get a check-up and make sure my blood pressure isn't too high.  I haven't been sleeping or eating well either.   VERY  stressed.  That's what two classes every week, 40 hours of work, homework, building a house, and watching my boyfriend's 7 year old daughter would do to someone.  Anyway, I'm happy now. :)

        Just had to post this, it's very funny!  Make sure your sound is on on your computer, and I recommend to wait until you get home as opposed to viewing this at work.  Enjoy!    urlLink  http://i.flowgo.com/greetings/madeapoop/madeapoop.swf

        Friday night Ken and I went to Ruby Tuesday for dinner (terrible service, we'll never go there again - it was on 611 in Warminster).  We then went to see "The Village".  I really enjoyed the movie!  I love movies that have a twist to it, and this one has about three twists!  I recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed his (M. Night Shymalan) movies!  Ken and I went to his friend Amy & Jason's wedding on Saturday.  It was very nice, a very short sweet ceremony, and a fun reception.  I met some more of his friends, and got along quite well with them.  We didn't get home until after midnight though, I fell asleep going home (I was very tired).    Yesterday we had his daughter, and I had to work on homework.  I got some packing started on Saturday, which is good because someone came to see the place Saturday afternoon when I was in the shower!  The person didn't get to see the bathroom, but oh well - maybe we should be notified next time?  Next weekend I'm going to Rockaway Beach in New York - I can't wait to get away!!  The following weekend Ken moves!  I want to add my new pictures to my website, but my parent's monitor is in the shop, and it's the only computer I'm able to download my pictures to.  Hopefully I'll figure something out.  Have a great week!  Musikfest is over too!  Thank goodness!  I HATE musikfest!!!!

        Last night I went to JC Penney's to get the dress for the wedding I'm going to Saturday.  I am also going to wear this to my friend Kelly's wedding, and the Dean's dinner I'm going to (for work) in which I get to see Cyndi Lauper in concert!  Anyways,   urlLink  here's a link    of what the print looks like.  I couldn't get a link of the actual dress, but the print is really cute!  It covers my tattoos (which I like to try to do when going to a wedding - or the Dean's dinner (especially).  I'm so happy.  I then went to Claire's a got a really cute pink pearl necklace,  urlLink  pink pearl earrings   (for my upper two ear piercings), and a cute  urlLink  drop down pink pearl earring set   as well.  Yay!  I had a successful shopping experience last night!

        I just had to put a quick note in as to the fact that I'm going nuts here at work! I start at 8am, after I check email and such it's about 8:30 or so. I then had to get some paperwork ready for a meeting that started at 10am. I  just  barely got it done. The meeting ran late, until about 11:30, then I had to run (literally) to the ladies room get my mail, sort what has to get signed by the Associate Dean, and check emails I received over the meeting, as well as voice messages. I am now about to leave for lunch. Right after lunch I have a webcast I'm watching with the Associate Dean until about 3:30 / 4pm. I then have to get a reminder email out, and anything else I could possibly get finished today before I leave at 4:30. I then go home, eat dinner, and go to the mall to find a dress for a wedding on Saturday. It's always so hard to find a dress that fits nice, hopefully I will. Anyway, this day has been completely crazy, and I can't wait until it's over!

        I just added a new comment type file thing, so everyone should be able to comment now. This blog thing is a bit confusing. I'll get the hang of it though. Last night was my last night of "Catholic Theology - An Introduction" - thank goodness! I'm VERY happy that class is over! Ken (my boyfriend) and I are planning to go see "The Village" this Friday. I haven't heard any reviews about it, I wonder how good it is. I like M. Night Shyamalan's movies, so I think I'll enjoy it regardless. Plus it was filmed in good 'ole PA! I also have a wedding this Saturday, and have to go dress shopping tomorrow night. Wish me good luck on finding a nice dress!

        I just started this up. A good friend of mine has a place, so I wanted to as well. It'll be a great place to keep my updates. This week is the last week of my "Catholic Theology - An Introduction" class at  urlLink DeSales University . It's been extremely difficult because I'm not very religious, and having a priest tell me how great the Catholic religion is was difficult to sit and listen to. Next week is the last week of my "Western Civilization since 1600" class. This was a very interesting class. I enjoy history, and this was more recent history. We watched " urlLink Schindler's List ", which I never saw before. It was very hard to watch that and realize that actually happened. I was very upset during most of the movie. It's very emotional, and so hard to imagine what the people that went through the Holocaust thought. It blows my mind. I start my next class "Philisophical Thinking" on August 24th. It's tough working full-time and going to school, but I just want my degree so I can teach!
