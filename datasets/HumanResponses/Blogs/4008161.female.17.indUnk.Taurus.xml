      This is the boy I am obsessed with.&nbsp; This is how I think of him: genius guitar god&nbsp;exuding joy and love that crowns him like&nbsp;a halo as he bends over, intent upon creating something beautiful.&nbsp; This is me: the unseen person behind the door,&nbsp;peering through the window for a glimpse of&nbsp;what I can never have but want with all my being.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can do nothing but obsess over him from far away, listen to his music and imagine that it is for me,&nbsp;wait for him to look up and spot my eager face, framed by the&nbsp;jail-cell window.&nbsp; Will he catch my eye and grin?&nbsp; Will he come out to meet me?&nbsp;&nbsp;Will he invite me inside?&nbsp; Or will he just smile sadly, pick up his guitar, and&nbsp;climb&nbsp;up the steps, even further out of reach?&nbsp;   This is new to me - this longing, this&nbsp;lowly position of dependence.&nbsp; Is this payback for always being the bitch?&nbsp; The tables have turned, and now I am the one crying, wishing, waiting.&nbsp; The thing is, I don't even mind.&nbsp; I know I am pathetic, but that knowledge does not&nbsp;create any feelings of shame or remorse at my&nbsp;revelations of&nbsp;undying love and my&nbsp;desperate yearning for reciprocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprisingly, I do not feel sad.&nbsp; This is his power;&nbsp;the mere thought of Him, even if it is not&nbsp;a happy one, makes me smile.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I analyze his every word, his every punctuation mark, searching for clues -&nbsp;clues to Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling forth&nbsp;the obsessive analyzation skills built into&nbsp;every female, I ponder the millions of possible meanings in his&nbsp;IMed sentance fragments.&nbsp; Long afterwards, I replay&nbsp;our conversations over and over again in my mind.&nbsp; Why did he say it that way?&nbsp; What if he meant this?&nbsp; No, he meant this.&nbsp; But wait!&nbsp; Remember when he said that?&nbsp; Oh yeah, so he must have meant&nbsp;this!&nbsp; The choices are mindboggling, and I drive myself crazy.&nbsp; But I love it.&nbsp; I love him.&nbsp; I love everything connected to him, even if it is my doubts.   He hasn't talked to me in a while.&nbsp; But I don't mind - I'll wait.&nbsp; A month ago, I would have&nbsp; ruthlessly mocked any girl who let herself be used by a boy in this way.&nbsp; But now, I don't care -&nbsp; I have been injected with this new sense of hope and optimism.&nbsp; Any embarassment I feel is immediately erased by the prospect of talking to him.&nbsp; I try to wean myself off of him.&nbsp; I am not going online today, i say.&nbsp; I refuse to call him.&nbsp; But it doesn't last.&nbsp; What if he is waiting for me?&nbsp; What if he thinks I am mad at him?&nbsp; What if he gets mad at me?&nbsp; What if....and the infinite number of what-ifs drives me to the computer screen, where I log on to my desktop - a photo of him hugging me.&nbsp; In the picture, I am ecstatic, and staring at it as I wait for the internet connection makes me realize how happy I am now - I'm going to talk to him.     &nbsp;

      I&nbsp;don't know why&nbsp;I created this blog -&nbsp;I do not flatter myself into thinking that anything I write is important or original enough to influence others.&nbsp; I am your typical, white, upper-middle-class teenage girl who likes to think she is special.&nbsp; I do keep a journal - a small, black notebook.&nbsp; I never let anybody read it, not because it protects deep, dark secrets that have the potential to&nbsp;ruin my reputation (if I have one), but because I have never written for anybody but myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The notebook is full.&nbsp; Yesterday, I filled the last pages exactly two years after I bought it and wrote my first entry.&nbsp; My two year anniversary.&nbsp; Should I celebrate?&nbsp; Celebrate two years' worth of embarassments, fights with parents, random crushes, and bad, experimental poetry?&nbsp;   In an attempt at nostalgia, I tried to read over some of my past writing, but I couldn't.&nbsp; Honestly, I felt so embarassed at the raw emotion that came through that i slammed the book shut and stuffed it back into its place at the corner of my desk.&nbsp; All the things I was so passionate about a year ago, a month ago, I don't care about anymore.&nbsp; I've moved on, and I cringe as I read my dramatic words and remember things I would rather forget.&nbsp; And then I wonder, all these&nbsp;things I&nbsp;am experiencing now -&nbsp;all the things that are&nbsp;really important to me now -&nbsp;in a few weeks or months, will they have&nbsp;assumed the status of embarassing trivialities that I once obsessed over?&nbsp; It is reassuring yet frustrating at the same time.&nbsp; While it is a comfort to remember that&nbsp;my present worries will soon pass, I resent the idea that my present worries and obsessions are not as important as I think they are.&nbsp; I would rather get pissed over these tiny little problems than go through life chanting, it could be worse, it could be worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;   By the way,&nbsp;I hate that whole philosophy of putting things into perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I complain about school or illness or&nbsp;a disagreement with a friend, my parents always tell me to Put It into Perspective.&nbsp; It could be worse, they say, you could be starving in Africa, living in a tiny hut with ten siblings.&nbsp;&nbsp;How can you complain about your mild case of strep throat&nbsp;when&nbsp;millions of people are suffering from AIDS? they ask me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, because I don't have AIDS.&nbsp; And is it really my fault that I have plenty of food in my fridge, or that I live in a nice house?&nbsp; I don't see why I should pretend to be completely happy all of the time&nbsp;just because somebody else's life is worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I admit&nbsp;I&nbsp;sound like a&nbsp;brat, but if you think about it, Putting Things into Perspective basically guarantees that you won't experience&nbsp;raw emotion.&nbsp; Unlike many others, I think of emotion as an asset rather than a weakness.&nbsp;&nbsp;So many people distrust their natural instincts.&nbsp; they tell me not to let myself get carried away by my feelings - don't make a decision until you have calmed down.&nbsp; But they are kidding themselves - all those people who profess to be objective -&nbsp;we are all human, and we all let our feelings influence us.&nbsp; And that is not necessarily a bad thing.&nbsp;   So...yes, this&nbsp;webpage&nbsp;will be filled with my random thoughts and&nbsp;adolescent&nbsp; angst.&nbsp; I apologize, but these are my problems; they may seem petty and routine, but they are all&nbsp;mine.

      It was one of those Matrix-like scenarios where everything you think is real turns out to be an illusion. In the dream, my parents were throwing me a grad party, and I was at the airport to pick up one of my friends. In the US Airlines terminal, Antonio Banderas, wearing a long black leather coat and dark glasses approached me and told me I was adopted. Of course, I laughed at him and told him to leave, but then, he showed me Proof (do not know what that proof was, but it was sufficient to make me believe his claims). So then, he told me that if I wished, my real father would explain everything to me at my grad party. Of course I consented, though in real life, I wonder why I would ever consent to let this man and my real father into the house inhabited by my imposter parents.  When I arrived home that day, my house was not at my driveway but had been replaced by my middle school as if a forklift had just picked it up and moved it. My family was nowhere to be found, but my party had already begun (even though it wasn't scheduled for another week). I met Antonio Banderas inside, and he directed me into a back room, where he set up a laptop computer. He then proceeded to show me webpages and articles that explained who my father was - a member of death row who had been in federal prison all of my life. Antonio Banderas informed me that the authorities have no idea who my mother is, and they only recently tracked me down. My father was a murderer. The pointer finger of his right hand was longer than his middle finger, and he was such a ruthless killer, his nickname was "Trigger Finger." I stared in horror at the photos of my father's mutated hand before screaming profanities at Antonio Banderas and running from the room.  I ran from my party and continued to sprint as far away as possibble. I thought I heard somebody chasing me, so I kept running until I couldn't anymore. I ran until I fell, gasping, onto my knees. Clutching my side, I stumbled to my feet only to recognize the ruins of Alcatraz Prison, just off the California coast. When I looked down at my muddy hands, the pointer finger of my right hand was longer than my middle finger.   I jerked awake at 5 a.m, sweating profusely. Trailing my hand across the walls for support, I scrambled into the bathroom and flipped on the light switch, ignoring the cry of my pupils as they shrunk. I fingered my right hand, measuring the fingers over and over again. In the mirror, my eyes were red and moist, my skin pale beneath my tan. I splashed myself with cold water and returned to bed, clutching my pillow.
