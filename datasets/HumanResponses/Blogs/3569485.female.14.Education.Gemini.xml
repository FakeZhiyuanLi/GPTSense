      Okay, So lately I have been so annoyed online. I am actaully only annoyed at two people and about one subject.                  So, the other day i was online and there really wasn't to many people on. I was just kinda messing around with some settings and stuff. Then, all of a sudden this girl, Emma, from my school started talking to me. And we weren't really into a conversation, it was still the little stuff like "hey" and "whats up", when she asked me if i could do a favor for her. I really thought nothing of it and i was just like, "sure, i guess."   Then she said, okay will you sign onto my new screen name and send my buddy list to the screen name i'm on now. So i told her that i needed her password in order for me to sign on. Then, she signed off. I was talking to BB at the time and i was telling her how pissed i was getting and how mean it was for Emma to just talk to me to get a favor.   So, about like, a couple minutes later Emma signed back on. She never said Hi or anything she just told me her password. So im like, yea whatever, I'll just get this horse s*** done with. Then, when i got onto her sn it didnt work and i ended up having to do it twice more, and when i was done she didn't talk to me anymore.. and she still hasn't!      The other time was right after the Emma thing and it wasn't as bad.   So, a girl named Taylor started talking to me. We actually got into a real conversation before she asked me to send one of her other screen names an email. But the thinng that really bothered me about this 'favor', was that she could have sent the thing herself, because she obviously has the internet and an email address!   So, if you know me and we never really "talk" DONT EVER GET INTO A CONVERSATION WITH ME TO ASK ME A FAVOR!!

      Okay, yesterday my mom asked Alex if he could clean my carpets with our carpet cleaner. My mom and I took all of my stuff that was on the floor and we put it up onto my bed. Then, today when my mom went down there to do some cleaning, she found my air freshener that was plugged into my wall, up on my dresser. Since i have a fancy cover like thing on my dresser it was really hard for her to see that it had leaked all over my brand new wood dresser. When she told me to come down there I saw the finish bascially scraped off of the whole entire left side of the dresser! My mom was so pissed that she kept saying "God, all i ever do is ask him to do simple things and he can't even accomplish that!" So, yea that's basically the news and I havn't seen Alex yet, but im sure that when my mom see's him, it's not going to be very pretty!

      Okay, so every year my dad and I go shopping together and he picks out what he wants for father's day and I pick out what I want for my birthday. So on the day before father's day, he called me and he said that we should get our shopping done so we didn't have to do it the next day. He told me that he wanted a portable vacuum cleaner and that it was around twenty dollors. I told him I would get it for him because i was spending twenty dollors on both Jack and him. So, we went to target and the vacuum ended up being fourty dollors. I got it for him anyways and told him that he would have to make up for it with my present.. and i was serious. When i was looking for my present, i couldmn't think of anything i wanted except for clothes.. when i told him, he just said that we would get them the next day. The next day.. Father's day.. we went golfing and then out to lunch. He than said after lunch that he wanted to go the next day because he was to tired. So when i called him the next day he told me that he had to work and that he would just try to get my a gift certificate. I am so f***en pissed off at him because i know that he's never going to give me anything and i just waiste fourty dollors on him. So now i decided i won't talk to him anymore for along time!....

      Well, the birthday party was a success! I had a great time, but i did end up getting some very weird presents.. such as threee pairs of socks and a chicken soup for the teenager's soul board game. The guys were also cheap, (well the one's that actually gave me a present) they all apparently decided to give me ten dollors. Which is generous but i would rather fifteen or twenty. And for father's day i gave Jack breakfest in bed and then all of these really sweet presents, and his stupid kids didn't even give him a card or present.. which i thought was really stupid and i was pissed.. because it is Jack's day and his kids wont even let him have a good day! So, now this week i have to get my tonsols and addnoids out ( i have no idea how to spell those two) and then i am going to get a tooth pulled and find time to go to my cousins in between. So i have a busy summer that's starting!

      This is my dedication page to my stepbrother Alex. I am dedicating this page out of hate and meaness, not out of love and niceness. I don't like Alex. He came to MY house this week and made a complete mess. He eats everything in site and then never puts away his dishes.. leaving them for me!He takes a shower and does all of his gay stuff and leaves a complete mess.... for me to clean up! I hate this and I hate him!!!!!!!!!!! AAAGHHHHHH!!!!!

      Okay, surprisingly nothing is really new around here. Siri isn't talking to anyone and when ever someone calls her house she just picks up the phone and then slams it down...can you say SYCO?!!!?!?!?! And Alex is here and he is a huge pig. He eats everything in site and then never cleans his mess.. leaving it for me! I reallly hate it when people do this so now I'm starting to leave messes and he actually can't stand it when other people leave messes and then i just blame them on him. So, i guess i have this figured out! Oh, and also,my mom has been being really cool lately, and so her and i have been getting along.. which is good because it is my birthday week and she and i have to get along because she's incharge of the party! hee...

      Okay, so everyone knows about Siri from reading "Life (whatever)" and she's like a total mental case! Well, the new news is that a couple of nights ago, she went out drinking with some friends and got really drunk. She then took 30 pills of Wellbutrin (which is a depression medicine that also helps her stop smoking) and she ended up having to get her stomach pumped! She's is like the stupidist person i know! I don't remember if i told you about her boyfriend Robert, but he found out about all this (and he is a really sweet guy!) and he told Alex that he knows Siri is cheating on him. Well, the day before Alex talked to Robert about this, he saw Siri on the couch in his mom's living room, going a little bit farther than kissing... if you know what i mean!!!!    So, yea thats the news for the week!

      Hello, i am new to this whole blog thing.. but my friend has a very good blog and so i thought that i would check it out! I am thirteen years old.. going to be fourteen on June 18!! YIPEE!!!!!! well anyways, my mom and dad have been divorced for eleven years and last year my mom got engaged to this guy. they ended getting married that same year and now we are one big happy family..NOT!! The guy's name is Jack. He is very weird sometimes,and to be perfectly honest, i really didn't like him at first. It took me almost half of a year to figure out that he really  isn't that bad and he always looks out for me and for what is best for me. So now it probably seems like we are a happy family and it only took a couple of months for this miricle to happen. well, not exactly. Jack has two  kids that he brought in to my protected life. The oldest is Siri, and she is 20 now. When my mom first started dating Jack she was 18 and a complete dissaster! She did  drugs, drank way to much, and was really mean to every one she layed eyes on. My mom and I both thought that she would go off to college(that is free.. her mom works at St. Norbert's college and gets free tuition to any  catholic college in the US for both kids)and then maybe get a civil job and a nice apartment. Well, only one of those things came true, she got a nice apartment. Actually, she got a really nice apartment in New York. This happened by meeting a guy on a boat when she was  working in Florida (don't ask me where she got the money.. i think she was a prostitute!)So yea.. one thing led to another and before i knew it, my mom told me Siri was living in New York with her new rich boyfriend. So now Siri is muching off of her boyfriend who gives her as much money as she wants. She has now decided to go to the best designers school in New York and get her money from Robert (boyfriend).Siri also just recently bought a car with her education money.. well she didn't relize at the time, but that brand new car is sitting in her mom's driveway because she can't possibly bring it to New York. So yea that is basically Siri.. and oops! don't let me forget, she was recently diagnosed with Bi-Polor dissorder and Personality disorder..Who would ever guess. Now onto alex, Jack's second child..and obviously he is a boy. Alex is seventeen and lives with his lunitic mother and sometimes with his drug inhaling sister that comes home perioticly. I feel really bad for him when he has to always be in the middle of things.. but he could always come to live with us.................NOT!!!!!!!!!! Most of the time i get very annoyed with him because he is always talking about himself! Either he is bragging that he just ran a marathon or that he is going somewhere with his mom's ex- boyfriend (who he still sees on a regular basis!)I have also noticed some signs that alex may be gay. He hates football, he doesn't wear boxers (i only know this because i had to do his wash.. Seriously!) and he talks about everything.. just like a girl. I don't know if he truley is gay.. but i think i will always think of him that way..hee!!! Well i better go because i am dieing to tell my good good friend Kellie that i got a blog.. and i know she will get a kick out of all of this. So yea. Oh, and as you read these more frequently, you will find out that i spell things wrong, i never capitalize my letters, and i use "......" alot... they're just fun!  So bye!

      Okay, so one Friday, July 2 I went to my cousin Brooke's house in Stevens Point. I knew that she had Pete's (her husband to be) nephew staying at their house. His name is Jimmy and he is 8. So, when Brooke picked me up at the gas station, where we were meeting, I met Jimmy for the first time. So we went into town and stopped at "the restraunt" that Pete owns.   After we got done eating it was around 6 or 7 so we went back to Brooke's house. I felt kind of weird because i barley said anything to Brooke the whole time which is really weird because we always have something to say to eachother! So when we got to her house i un packed and went to bed.   The next day, I woke up really early because i ended up having to sleep in the same bed with Jimmy because he threw a fit about having to sleep on the couch. And oh my god, threw out the whole entire night he never stopped moving and getting up to play with the dog. I am so serious, he never stopped moving when i was trying to fall asleep. So i woke up early, because once again he was up and moving.   ~Pete's sister and neice are also living at Brooke's house because they aren't able to move into their new house until July 18 and his sister, Marcie, is incharge of one of Pete's restraunts and so she has to be in Stevens Point. Pete's neices name is Nikki and she is 15 and can sometimes be a bitch. During the day she works at the resteraunt where her mom is.~  When i woke up, Brooke was still sleeping and Jimmy was on the couch watching tv. When ever i would get up to go get somehting to eat, go to the bathroom, get something in my room, Jimmy would folllow me... but deffinetly not into the bathroom! He started to get really annoying so i decided that i would watch a movie with him to help him sit down for a while.  When Brooke got up, all three of us just kinda sat around, and for some reason something still didn't feel right, but i still didn't know what. So, Brooke and i started talking while i was making Jimmy Mac and Chesse and she said someting like "i wish i could tell you what was going to happen today" and see, i kinda knew that i was going to have something happen including a little birthday party for me since my family didn't see me on my birthday. So then i started smiling because i kinda knew something and i just couldn't help my self, my mouth just wouldn't close! Then, that gave Brooke a clue that i knew what was going on. But knowing her, she right away said that i knew everything that was going on.. which i didn't, i just knew we were having a little get together.  So, a couple hours later most of my little family came over. My aunt bought me a little cake that said "happy birthday Stephanie" so that made me feel good. Not many people were there because i have a very small family the way it is, so it was hard to start conversation because i didn't know what to do.   After we ate cake one of my aunts' and one of my uncles' left to go home. So, then it was me, Jimmy, Brooke, my other aunt Sandee, my other uncle Neil (who are both Brooke's parents) and Brooke's 19 year old sister. ~ Brooke is going to be 23~ We sat around for a while and then every one left. We were actually planning to go to a thing called riverfront that night. And riverfront is right by my aunt and uncle's house.. Sandee and Neil. So, there is tents of beer, food, icies... so on. There is also a band every night.. and then on the fourth they have fireworks. I guess the reason why it is so much fun because.. my entire family is there.. both sides. There are really hot guys that you try to 'look good for'. (and i do that because i dont know these people, they dont know me, and they never will.. otherwise i would never really try to impress a guy at home) So, we were planning on going to the riverfront that night, but since it kept raining on and off we decided that we would go bowling. We did end up going bowling, and Nikki straightened my hair for me so that I could wear it like that for the fourth. The bowling ally was fun.. but not the best. I got really tired after awhile because we had to fricken play three games we couldn't have only played two.  That night when we got home from bowling had to have been the best and funniest night of my life! My cousin Ashley.. who is Brooke's 19 year old sister... got kinda of drunk when we were bowling. So, she decided to come home with us for some odd reason that i dont know. When she got to Brooke's house, Pete told her that they should do shots of Oozo.. which is a very strong Greek alcohol and an American can barly keep down one shot... Ashley ended up having five!!!!  So, after five shots of a very strong alcohol she got drunk beyond reason. She didnt throw up but she did do some very funny things. She pretended that the kitchen floor was a swimming pool so she had to go swimming to get some exercise. Then she couldn't look up at the fan because she thought it was going to take her for a ride and she didn't want to go for one because she didnt feel good. Then she took Pete's leather jacket, put it on, and pretended she was an FBI agent by puting it up close to her face and pretending she was hiding with a gun in her hand. Then with the same jacket she pretended she was James Bond and was running around jumping infront of people and rolling on the walls. It was so halarious and i have never laughed so hard in my life!  On the fourth we went to riverfront and watched fourty five minute long fireworks. I was really happy on how i looked that night because i fit into a size one pants and they looked really good on me! So yea.. not to much more to say and my hands are really hurting after writing this all!  bye!
