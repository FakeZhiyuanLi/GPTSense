       urlLink      The Champster          So I got my first Birthday present today, a Hamster we call Champ, from Marcy and Sterk. I was kinda nervous about what there surprise was, actually I was very scared.           I guess Champ will be the Cross Country Mascot, Im gonna have to go to the pet store tomorrow and get him some things. Im also gonna have to keep it away from Skittles, he doesn't really like when I give other animals attention, but i really like my new Hamster, as long as it doesn't shit in my hand......

       urlLink      Gotta Love Bridget and Liz......           The Planners, this was takin awhile ago but I was just reminded by Corcoran that I was suppose to put it in the blog.     I haven't wrote in awhile, I think I have suffered from a slight case of writers block. Or Maybe the Cubs losing the pass 2 series, has just made     me feel like shit. It Might be because my Birthday is Monday, and it will probably be shitty. I have been able to take a "Vacation", Just laying around all weekend watching the Olympics, and crying about the Cubs. Monday its back to School which I am kinda Happy About, and bc me and Katie have a awesome parking spot.       Happy Birthday Andy which was The 17th and Maura Which was The 16th.

        So yesterday as i was coming home from the Dunes my cousin calls and says " i have a lot of work for you, when can you come in". SO I was at work at 8:00 this morning, when my last day was suppose to be August 6th. IT IS AUGUST 13th. Im not gonna complain, because I really need the money. So i come today, and my cousins not even here! So me and Jenn, just planned my future, Im gonna be a Designer/ Carpenter.... who writes books. Sounds Interesting, since Marcy keeps insisting that Im gonna marry a NBA Star and be " Bling Bling" ( I hate when Marcy says "bling bling"). I do wanna write a book though, i really like to write, its one reason I have this Blog.          Ive been getting pumped up for the Olympics since July watching ESPN classics "Road to Athens". Tonight was the opening cermony, I watched some of it, I realized that there are way to many countrys in the World and half those people didn't look like athletes. Im not really into watching the Track part besides the Steeple Chase, but i like watching weird stuff like fencing, and Judo. It was kinda upsetting that The USA Baseball team didn't Qualify this year.     Another big Upset was that the Cubs lost to San Diego yesterday after 11 innings, and lost to the Dodgers today at the last inning!           Things That Happened Tonight....      - Marcy asked me if i was a citizen...... and I told her I was born in Africa. Some people are just Dumb.     - Jaime McBride stopped by w/ her friend British.     - Saw Stans car at foodies, he was probably getting a 12er, and getting "crushed" before tomorrows race ( I would say BIG RACE, but I hear theres only 20 people).                                                Night ALL

        So over the weekend my mom suggested that I don't get enough sleep, and she is exactly right! So I took it upon myself to go on vacation...... Well not a real vacation but it sounded good. I don't really know what this vacation is going to consist of, but hopefully...     - No Work     - No Driving      - SOME SLEEP!          Today is the first day, my mom woke me up at 7 to take her to the train because she was running late ( every morning she is running late)!! I can't say I was surprised even though she told me last night she wouldn't..... Today I planed on laying around, and Watching some TV, which I did. Some people don't really care that your on Vacation, especially when they want there computer fixed......      I don't think this Vacation will last another day, Ive realized I like being tired and getting up early. I love the mornings. I was kinda weird not to work today, Its been a day and I think I miss it.       Some good things did happen, I saw TopGun, which is one of my favorite movies. My brother Jay called, we talked awhile. I never really get to talk to my older brothers, its almost like they don't exist.        Happy August 9th, and HAPPY 16th BIRTHDAY Erin Kalisz. I love August birthdays!

       urlLink      Marcy....No commet   Now Marcy really wanted to be apart of this Blog, because shes a good friend and all. I don't really know why she was touching her eye, and she will probably kill me for putting it on here...Oh well (I just figured out how to put picture on my blog). This day i was being really mean to her. WARNING: Never make running comments to Marcy Farrell. Thats one thing Ive learned throught this year!

       urlLink          The Temple      So this morning I woke up at 745, to go to the 10 mile run with the cross country team. My position was water girl, I was simply to take the water bottles to the third mile...... Wat sounded so simple, turned out to be a nightmare. It seems like I drove around looking for a way into this trail forever! I asked like 5 people and everyone talked about how shitty stans map was... You couldn't even make out the words. So I call Hil J Sterk, whos lazy ass was in the bed instead of running, and told her how fucking lost I was. At one point I thought about these runners at the 4th mile, dying for a drink of the water that was in my car. Then I thought how the hell am I gonna be the team manager and can't even get the team water.           SO this is when it begins.......I see this guy and ask him, he tells me to take this Lemont street to some west entrance. I'm driving down lemont and Im getting further and further away from the trail, Then I see this huge ass bridge, it looked like it sat on top of the town, with all these trees behind it.... So im thinking Im NOT getting on this bridge to nowhere lets turn around.          BIG MISTAKE.... I could only make a left turn so I did...... Only to realize I was turning into the Hindu Temple of Greater Chicago, when I read the sign my heart was pounding, I called sterk back practically screaming on the phone, and she was laughing her ass off. So I turn into the white porcelain gate and turned around, Then I saw the Temple, I was shaking, it was the weirdest thing, but i felt like I was possessed by the Hindu Spirit. I turned out the gate and hauled ass back to the trail! The temple scared the Fuck out of me.

         Well today I was sittin around, Reading Murphs New Blog, and I thought.... HEY! I have nothing but Free time so wat the hell, Ill make a blog. Now I really don't know exactly wat I will be saying in this, theres nothing really exciting about anything going on in my life, I do have some funny friends and a crazy ass family.... but i will mostly be writing this because I have nothing but free time until August 23rd, Which also happens to be my birthday!          Today was Gay, it was my second to last day of working, Thank God! I hate my job, but sometime its fun working with my cousins and aunt, but its not fun when it seems like Im there personal Bitch.. which is all the time. After work, I returned katelynns belongings that I had so long and chilled at the Krahn House awhile. Its one place I love going, what can I say.. I love the Krahns. Then I went to the Raske Household to eat her puppy chow, but I was dissappointed that Jeffrey wasn't there and left. I think I have an obsession with Sarahs little brother, hes so cute, esp. when he calls me CMitch.            So i think Im gonna go to bed soon, MY LAST DAY of work is tomorrow and Im getting excited!
