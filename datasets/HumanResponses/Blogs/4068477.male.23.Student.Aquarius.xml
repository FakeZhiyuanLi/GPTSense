      Everybody tells me i use that line too&nbsp;much "IM TIRED",&nbsp; well you know what, I am tired all the time.&nbsp; don't ask why, cause I don't know.&nbsp; Today was the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Went to work and came home.&nbsp; Kind of pissed off today though.&nbsp; We were supposed to goto see Randy Rogers band tonight.&nbsp; I get on their website and notice that they aren't here tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Im listening to a song right now called "its hard to kiss the lips at night that chews your ass&nbsp;out all day long"&nbsp;&nbsp; Thats funny right there, i dont care who u are.&nbsp;&nbsp; Randy is on right now, i guess that will do for tonight for missing the show.&nbsp;&nbsp; not really but thats what im going to go with.&nbsp; I really like this band more and more everytime i listen to them.&nbsp; Got a different sound to them.&nbsp; Went and saw them at some LITTLE bar in Galveston.&nbsp; Got to talk to them after the show so that was cool.&nbsp; Then we went to the beach after.&nbsp; Thats for a later post.&nbsp;&nbsp; Going home this weekend to see family.&nbsp; The mrs. is staying home to work, somebody has to pay for the trip.&nbsp; Just kidding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ill admit it, she's the bread winner in the family.&nbsp; Ill try to get back on sometime sat. or sun.&nbsp; Untill then "Tonights not the night".&nbsp; TTTTM  T

      I figured I would get into the blogging that has been going around.&nbsp; Seems like everybody has a blog these days, so i thought i needed one too.&nbsp; It's been rainy here the last couple of days.&nbsp; An outside job isnt fun in the rain.&nbsp; I would just go home and sleep, but i dont think the mrs. would like that.&nbsp; And if i did go home, she would make me clean or run errands.&nbsp; I would rather work and just get wet.&nbsp; Its past midnight and im still up causing of a pounding headache.&nbsp; I hope these things end when i get my glasses.&nbsp; Starting to make me mad.&nbsp; I titled my blog "who's to say?" because i think it fits for a lot of things in life.&nbsp; It part of a Pat Green song.&nbsp; If you are reading&nbsp;this and u know who i am, you know that i am a "Greenhead" or just a big PG fan.&nbsp; Watched Starsky and Hutch tonight,&nbsp; i liked it but Kris didnt. (kris is the mrs.)&nbsp; She fell asleep half way through it which is nothing new.&nbsp; Dont think she has made it through a whole movie in a couple of years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well im off to bed,&nbsp; till next time.&nbsp; TTTTM
