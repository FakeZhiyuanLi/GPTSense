						   I've been watching that movie "Blue Crush" for about 15 minutes and I already hate it. No depth, no dialogue, no point. The actors are awful - every line in the movie sounded utterly scripted, and not to mention that the content of their conversations is terrible. This is just a fuel for capitalist, egotistical mindsets of our corrupted youth. The "extreme" sports, the "dirty dancing," the pathetic conversations about "who's hot." This is exactly the kind of stuff that blows me away in public. People try to emulate this fake life and it is simply pathetic. We have the worst media in the world.  If I could tell you anything, I'd say - save yourself time and money and don't watch this pathetic excuse for a movie. Save yourself your dignity and your personality.

						   "I want to tell you something Mark, something you do not yet know, that we K-PAXians have been around long enough to have discovered. The universe will expand, then it will collapse back on itself, then will expand again. It will repeat this process forever. What you don't you know is that when the universe expands again, everything will be as it is now. Whatever mistakes you make this time around, you will live through on your next pass. Every mistake you make, you will live through again, and again, forever. So my advice to you is to get it right this time around. Because this time is all you have."  -Kevin Spacey, K-PAX  You really should watch that movie. Really.

						   Its been over 12 hours since I wiped that matter from my eyes and woke up to a day of waking up all over again. I guess things went over well today. I slept in school. Four or five times. eek. Anyway, I'll let that rest (hah) for now. I guess that if I had any kind of mind-altering thoughts today, I should post them here. No real mind altering ones, but I do have a little story for you.  I got in the car with snow on my feet and a chip on my shoulder when my mom told me that I had to go tutor a little girl. I honestly was furious. I just wanted to get home, get some extra sleep, finish my homework, and factory make another one of my underachieving days. So, we go home, I do some stuff for about thirty minutes, then I leave to go tutor little Elle. When I was walking up the stairs I was angry. Some little girl had to take up my time because my mom volunteered me for some more damned service. Oi vey. So we're waiting at the door, I'm getting ever belligerent because of the cold trying to bite off my ears. Then the lady opens the door and I guess that looking inside the house made me realize it wasn't going to be so bad. I don't mean for people to take that the wrong way, but something about that house just calmed me down. So I walk in, and I was looking around, and noticed a little girl sitting at a table eating some food, a couple papers on the table. So, after meeting her mom, I sit down and talk to her, and I started to help her with the math she was having trouble with. From what I had understood from before, her mom and my mom made it sound like she wasn't at all good at math, but the fact of the matter is that she was really smart. So, after we cleared up the math and she told me she understood everything, my mom decided we should leave. The funny thing is that when Elle smiled at me because she understood something or thought my little tricks were funny, it seemed to make all of that work with her a lot more valuable than sleeping another day away. So I left, feeling a lot better than I did before. I guess helping people out and using a little of your own time isn't always that bad.  You really ought to try it some time.

						   Well, I'm about to go to bed. To save myself hours of staying up thinking about the perfect words for my feelings, I'll try to put them on this little page.  I recently searched through some of the old chats I had with old acquaintainces and I realized a couple things. One, I was a complete asshole to a kid that never deserved anything that he got... and if he's reading this, I'd like him to know that I am sorry beyond all belief. I never cut the kid slack and I really should have. Secondly, I realize that I really really miss a certain someone and the fun I used to have - talking till the sun came up, talking till there never should have been anything to talk about anymore, but now I don't much talk to that person. I guess I have my reasons. If she is reading this, I'd like her to know that I appreciate all those fun times in the past. I guess that's really all I noticed. If I ever see that kid again, I promise not to make his life a living hell. God, I was an asshole.  I just hope that I can still be a good person with the way I act now. Sometimes I really do try. And sometimes I really don't.  Oi vey.  I'm going to bed.

						   I made this blog today. I guess that I need to get thoughts out and on paper. Well, not so much paper, but just out and about. I don't really intend to write things in here with hopes of people reading it, but I do it just so I know that people can really find out what I'm like inside this funny little shell. I keep thinking that I should make this introduction something I will remember, catchy phrases and unique wisdom, but its not really coming out that way. Thats all okay though. I'm just glad I can finally write some things down.  I guess I have had a bit of stuff on my mind today. Nothing huge, just those everyday thoughts. Recently, I've been wanting to find a way to channel my anger into something that will come out good, but what I would really like is just to get rid of all my animosity with everything all together - leave my feelings, my thoughts, my philosophies, my politics, my agression and everything else at the door. However, thats a lot easier said than done. I feel like a lot of my agression comes from things like loud noises, loud people, offensive behavior, annoying people, and the like. I think that if I stand back and look at all that, the only way I could possibly avoid it would be to move to a small island, away from Americans, away from zealous, 'pieous,' 'informed' people. Sure, I don't intend on that right now, but I've always felt that maybe some time in the future I would move to a different country. Maybe England or Canada, no where strange and oriental. That probably sounds weird to a lot of people, but hey, maybe opening up my mind to new things will make me a little more at peace with myself.  I don't know what else to say today. Not a lot. Come back later if you want to delve into the mind of Mr. Goldberg.

						   I don't know if you're out there, but I know you're still alive. I don't know if you're reading this, but I really hope you would.  You go by the name "Andrew Stone," and you were my neighbor for about six or seven years, and to be honest, I was a complete ass to you. A person that has been true to be for a long time recently told me that I shouldn't let this eat away at me and that I should just forgive myself. I completely understand and respect what she means, but that doesn't help the fact that I ruined years upon years of your life with childish taunting when I used to be a little brat. I don't want to make this too long winded. You know what I had said, you know what I was like, and now I hope you know I'm sorry for all that stuff I put you through.   People will tell you that you don't need to forgive and identify every mistake in your past, but if you fail to do so with every mistake you make, you will never grow into a better person.  I wish you many long and happy years, Cayce Goldberg.  P.S. - If anyone knows his AIM screenname, please, drop me a line. I'd prefer to do this one on one.

						   I hate to make generalizations because we all do it so often. I can honestly say I will generalize a lot of things, and then I will turn around and criticize someone else for making a different kind of stereotype. It's that whole "do as I say, not as I do" concept.  With that in mind, I would like to make a commentary and observation on a type of personality that I really dislike. For sake of my fingers and the hope that I don't get carpal tunnel, I'll give them a  general  term -- "Testosterite." I'm sure by simply reading that name you can gather what it is that I don't like about certain people. However, it goes deeper than people trying to be overly "manly." It goes down into seeking attention, having a superiority complex, having a foul-sounding inner self, and other things.  I get confronted by many types of people nearly every day - nice people, loud people, shy people, angry people, depressed people, self-proclaimed nymphomaniacs, and more than I can possibly count. However, out of every "type" of personality I encounter, there is really only one that makes me clench my teeth so tight they feel as if they could shatter, and that is the kind I have dubbed as Testosterites.   How can I explain a Testosterite? They are a person that is extremely attuned to what they believe to be some sort of birth-given code of manliness, a way of how their actions will play out. However, what they fail to realize is that this "code" is fabricated by society. They will make commentary on television shows, on sexual orientation, on artistic imagery, on beliefs, on cars, on food, on height, on weight, on haircolor, on race, on country, on family, on genitals, on shoes, on money, and worst of all, on women. A prominent factor in people with this (as I see it) disorder is that they feel extremely superior to females. They feel like a female is a pathetic, ignorant, incapable creature who is meant to be overseen and controlled by men. In all honesty, this kills me.   Now, I did say before that their ethical code is built into them by society, however, I do acknowledge that to some degree males are mentally different than females because of genetic codes. What I mean to say, is that men have a natural tendency to do some things differently than females. However, you cannot generalize what being a "man" is and what being a "lady" is. Some men enjoy ice skating just as much as women do. Some women enjoy killing animals just as much as some men do. It is simply an opinion type of thing. However, it is often more typical you will see men lifting 75 pound weights than women purely because men are genetically built to attain muscle faster. This does not mean any person has the right to discriminate against a man who has not "built his muscles" as quickly or as shapely as any other man. Also, it does not give any person the right to discriminate against women who do have muscles because they have trained, or to look down on those who have little physical capabilities.  Do you not believe me that there are some things women can do that men cannot? Well, I would like to offer you a nice little test that will alter your mindset a little. Go find a chair. One with four legs and a 90 degree seat and backrest. Now, take this chair over to a wall. Turn it so that if you were sitting in it you would be looking at the wall. Stand behind the chair and bend over and grab both sides (left and right) of the seat with your hands. You should now be bent in a kind of 90 degree angle. Make sure your head is touching the wall, and the experiment will begin. Try to lift your torso back up so that your are standing in correct posture, but holding the chair in your hands.  Most men (like myself the first time I tried) thought that it would be easy. I mean, hey, a chair doesn't weigh that much, how hard can it be? The experiment proved me wrong beyond all belief. About 9/10 of men cannot perform this action. Why is that? A man is genetically built so that his upper body looks like a capital 'Y.' That is to say, from the shoulders down, a man's body will taper.  However, a woman is more of a pear shape or a lightbulb shape. They are wider at their hips than their shoulders. So what does this all mean? It means that a man's center of gravity is further up on his body, and a woman's center is closer to her bellybutton; her middle. It is much easier for a woman to do this task than a man because the weight of her body is equally balanced from lower to upper because most of their mass is in the hip area.   So what was I trying to show through all of that? I was trying to show that men are not entirely more physically capable than women because they are endowed by their "Code-o-manliness," but rather by genetics. Women do not have some "Code-o-lifting-up-chairs" that they inherit, they are simply better built because of the laws of gravity. Now, that is what men need to get through their heads. They need to understand that just because we are genetically better at physical activity does not mean that we need to enjoy every physical-oriented activity and preach about what most fits in that sort of "manly" category.  Now I would like to digress so that I can comment more on what I do not like. A thing about Testosterites that I find repulsive is that they try very hard to be better than the people around them. They will throw slurs like "fatass," "moron," "f*ggot," etc., and they usually say it so that it will very much hurt the person they are saying it to. Do they say it because they are endowed with needing to point out such things at birth? Not at all. They are simply insecure with themselves because they once realized they have a full spectrum of emotions. By throwing around a ton of obscenities, they can achieve a feeling of "manliness." I do not like people who abuse words like that to make themselves feel better.   Another point that I dislike is their social aesthetics. What I mean by that is that a Testosterite "needs" to be a connoisseur of fast cars, of "manly" television, of angry music, of disrespect, of womanizing, and most importantly, of penis-envy. That's right. Most every one that I meet has a very large problem with their genitals. They feel like it is the center of their being and that they define your worthiness as a human being. People, genitals were designed to dispose of waste and to reproduce, not to be judged as your value as a person. Furthermore, they will usually judge women entirely by their breast size or how much skin they will show off. The funniest thing is that if they show off too much skin, they're a slut, but if they don't show enough, they're a goody-two-shoes-prude-little-bitch. Oh, but its alright to watch women bounce up and down on a trampoline and oogle their breasts! Yes, Testosterites are a very confusing, illogical kind of people.  They will believe that drinking, defying authority, wasting money on fast cars, stickers, sports equipment, etc., will make them a better man. They usually lack cultural stimulation, purely because they only dabble in what being a "man" really is. They usually have shallow minds, small vocabulary, big tempers, a lot of insecurities, and a strong opinion about sexuality.   To all the men out there, just listen to me when I say that being a man is what you make it out to be, not what "The Man Show" tells you. And to all the Testosterites, make yourself feel better and call me a f*ggot for posting this! Go you!  EDIT: Replaced miswording of 'genitals' as 'gentiles.' Sorry, the spellchecker will have its way with your posts if you aren't careful.

						   Here I am today. I am existing. I am breathing. I am living. Most importantly, I am  thinking.    Last night I lay awake wondering something that I had never thought before: Would it be possible, at some time in the future, to replicate a human brain? That is not to say to program a machine to respond to basic commands, but to make a replica of a logically thinking brain. One that can deduct reasoning from situations, one that can learn, one that can function independently of its creators. But furthermore, I do not mean to clone a brain and implant it into someone. I mean to build some kind of entity that is capable of learning capacity and logic.  I know for a fact that at the stage of technology our world is at right now, it is absolutely impossible to do something of this calibur. This kind of replication technology is hundreds, possibly thousands of years ahead of us, and I will never see something like this in the few years I will spend on this blue planet. However, I feel that many things could happen that could broaden the spectrum of possbility -- call me looney if you want to, but take the automobile for example. It was seen as a ridiculous concept that was so farfetched it could never happen. Who is to say that an artificial, independent brain could not at some point be created?  Now, the only thing I see wrong with it is this: if a person is to create something, regardless of how they try, their personality will in one way or another shine through. That is to say, you cannot make a completely untainted object, a blank "brain," in which it has never been stimulated by some kind of outside knowledge. Take for example your computer. This may not immediately jump to your mind, but a computer has been built to only be stimulated by certain things. Things that you want it to be stimulated by. It will not be stimulated by people talking, visuals, sound, feeling... only by a simple input of data. Herein is where the problem lies - how could you create an object in which you do not put a basic medium of attainable data? That is to say, there is no definate object that the "brain" would learn from, only knowledge in basic.   The human brain is a strange object. It is split up into sectors - each one holds different "types" of knowledge, yet this is a concept fabricated by our minds. Is there really short-term memory, or is it all long-term? Vice versa? Who am I to say? The biggest problem in creation would be identifying the different types of knowledge for each sector. All knowledge is not taken in the same way. Your brain is split between visual / tangible stimulation and abstract / audio stimulation. How would it be possible to make something that could distinguish between different types without teaching it in the first place? There are so many "what if's" for something like this.  However, I am adamant that something like this is not impossible in the future. It could very well be possible that you could make some sort of memory holding object that would take in its own data, analyze it by itself, conclude its own logic, etc. I cannot make as many possibility comments on something that is so far ahead of our time as I can impossibility comments. I would just suggest to keep an open mind.  The one thing that would amaze me with a creation like this would be the ability for it to make its  own  creations. Could you imagine if you could simply build a human replica that could build itself by simply reading directions that it had never seen before? Could you imagine if you could actually teach a machine, one that would grow and learn and develop an opinion? Could you imagine the possibilities? It could be a utopia or it could be the destruction of humankind as we know it. Its all such a cliché, but it is all so interesting.  Perhaps you could build your memories and your life into a machine like this before you die. It could be eternal life; eternal hell.  I could babble about this for hours, but I'm going to let you use your own gift of thinking on the subject.

						   Here comes a (what I believe to be) thought-provoking analytical / observational essay on existence, life, chance, and choice. This is not what Christians believe to be "God." This is nothing that is widely mainstream public. This is not a person, a place, or a thing. It is something beyond anything that exists, because it is the force that encourages, ends, prolongs, and even destroys existence.  I myself have never believed in such a thing as God, and to be honest, I don't think I ever could. The idea is so farfetched and unproven to me that I simply cannot see the logic behind the existence of such a creature. However, I will not deny that I can see unexplainable patterns and forces in things that many professionals explain simply as "nature." Well, potentially, nature is a very broad topic. It could be anything from the elements, to natural selection, even to chemical reactions.   I always look at things like trees, for example, and I wonder how such an elaborate, yet unique bark pattern forms on the tree. No two trees are exactly identical, but they all have a common look about them. That is to say all bark will have a similar base, but not similar detail. Okay, I've always understood this. This was not a concept that was beyond my grasp. But what is, and is to everyone, is how bark decides to patternize itself. Why does it suddenly decide to jut to the right at this part? Why will it split at this part? For what reason will it make a loop here? Why is this ridge straight? If I were to give you a simple answer for this, I would tell you that it is the Will of Nature.  Now, I don't want you to starting e-mailing me questions about "What does Nature look like? How does it choose? Will it talk to me? Can I talk to it? Does it control me?" The fact of the matter is that I have no damn clue, but this is simply observation and speculation, none of which should be interpreted as bare-bone truth.  With that aside, I would look to make some opinions on what I believe Nature to be. Nature, unlike the ever-so-popular concept of God, does not take form as a single entity, and it is not possible. Nature is not a tree, a forest, or a continent. It is not a leg, an ant, a person, or a community. It is nothing that exists on Earth that is tangible. The only thing that I believe Nature to be is an abstract concept and force behind everything that exists. The difference between "tree nature" and "abstract nature" is that abstract nature does not, as I said before, come in any tangible form. It simply influences everything.  Now, I'm sure you're all brewing up thousands of inconsistencies about my theories in your head to prove to me why I am wrong and your Bible, or whatever for that matter, is correct. To be honest, I am not surprised that there are inconsistencies and unanswered questions. Nature is not a simple concept. Nature is not a concept that can be grasped by my mind, or any mind. It is something so far beyond us that we will never understand why it chooses to do what it does. By that, do I mean that it is intelligent? To some degree, yes, I do. I believe Nature makes choices in order for the universe, as we know it, to chain together.   Why do I believe this? Well, scientists have often said that there is such a tiny chance for life to spark on a planet, that we are an extremely lucky world. They say that many planets potentially hold all the recipes for life, but some simply do not pull through. This is why Nature is an inconsistent, unexplainable concept. It does and it does not. It chooses what will exist and what will not, but not always why. Everything I can explain about it will simply be open-ended, illogical phrases, but that is all that I can put it as, from my own point of view. I see it as a non-tangible, intelligent, choice-making force that will do as it sees fit for whatever reason it sees fit.  That is to say... imagine you have a rectangle of empty circles. It is 400 circles high and 10,000 circles long. You are to choose, for whatever reason you deem necessary, which circles will be filled in black, and which circles will not. Sometimes nature will choose a pattern that will repeat, sometimes it will choose a method of chaos. Sometimes it will choose a placement that suits the rectangle to fit in with its environment, and sometimes it will choose a placement that distinguishes it from all others. However, unlike you and I, it seems as if, for the most part, Nature is constantly aware of the ramifications of the placements, and the possibilities and advantages of other types. That is to say, it will not make a polar bear blood-red when it lives in a white environment. That is also to say that if a fish, at some point or another, were to require the ability to walk on land, Nature would see this need as necessary or not necessary.   However, many people will not be satisfied by that. Why will only some fish sprout legs, but others will simply remain as fish? This is one thing I cannot even lend human logic to. Nature will decide what it decides, and we are all under its influence. Just because a human will see it fit in their minds that wings are necessary, Nature will not always deem it so. It will choose as it needs and it will need what is fit.  One thought that comes to my mind is - what did Nature just spring up from? Has it always existed? Was it some how created? If so, what by? Why? The one flaw (or perhaps greatest design) that Nature has put in humans is the insatiable desire for an answer. Humans will not be satisfied by answers like "because" or "it is the truth." A human being requires logic behind rules, and without logic, they can easily dismiss the subject.  And that is why so many people will disagree with me that Nature is the force behind existence. But that, for one reason or another, is just what it wants us to do.

						   There's a funny thing about dogs.  Its not that they try to get dirty. Its not that they will take food from a bowl and drop it on the carpet to eat it. Its not that they will try to fight creatures bigger than them. Its the fact that they have a very rare form of unconditial care for the person that takes care of them. No matter how bad your day has been, or how many people you've had to yell at, when you come home, your dog will always greet you happily because it knows that you care for it.  A dog will listen to anything you say, and never disagree with you. A dog will never talk to you when you are aggrivated, but will pay you the attention you need when you are lonely. A dog will never take your possessions from you and claim they were their's first. A dog will never lie to you about what it really thinks, because you can always see it in their almond-shaped, glittery eyes.  A dog is a great pet to have, but it is so degrading to think of them so.

						   The person I write this to knows who they are. They know why I am writing this, they know the details. The people that are reading this will try to understand, and I hope I can help clear things up. It is about the hostility and aggression I have been receiving upon my consideration of leaving the IB program.  To whom it may concern, do not take this as a personal attack. I intend for you to read this as a neutral-opinion individual reading to understand. You took too quickly to your opinion for a judgment from myself, the person who is involved. I would appreciate it if you read this.  I was recently confronted about my possible decision of leaving what could be many years of pointless agony for what it is I am shooting for. I do not intend to possess the ideals of the program -- the Astrophysicist who is also the Nationally Renowned Lawyer, also known for being the World's Foremost Expert on Multilateral Ionic Compounds and the like -- I'm just a simple guy looking to do what it is that I like.   I don't care if I live in poverty because of it, I don't care if you or the program don't accept me for what I believe, I don't care if everyone I know forgets me because I simply made a choice instead of doing what I was told. This is the crossroads of my future. I can go one way (the route of the IB program,) one littered with bumps, rocks, potholes, and other various debris in order to get good suspension and better steering (when in fact I'm aiming for better acceleration,) or I can go down the other way (a different school,) one that looks to be pretty straight, a bit foggy, a few curves, so at the end I can go where I want and smile because the ride was easy on my car.  If you were dearly confused by my comparison, look at it this way -- I'm not out to become a "general-expert" on a couple topics, a majority of which will come in no use to me, but I would rather like to be a full fledged professional with boundless knowledge of one subject. Don't get me wrong, some people really like the program because it keeps their options open. They can do what they want and they can say that they have the past to prove it.  However, the one reason I know I won't go over well with the program is because I don't have (and honestly I sincerely hate) the same intelligence stimulation concepts as the people in the program. That is to say, I prefer not to bombard my mind with countless topics for a big exam that is supposed to sum up how well I know everything. It is my opinion that a test does not prove how well you know something, just how well you can regurgitate the words that were thrown at you. The IB program has thus far taught me little to nothing new, just the same thing other people are being taught with a lot more worksheets.  If getting a regular education with a lot of "write-it-downs" helps you learn, then good for you. But understand that I do not learn that way. It will not make me more intelligent to simply repeat something over and over until its so hammered into my mind that I will recite it in my sleep when I am thirty. I learn better by making my own decisions and own observations with what I have learned, not by basing my personal knowledge off of what some institution tries to convince me of. The Program has its beliefs on what knowledge is, and I have my own.    I know, as before, you are convinced I am doing this because of the "less work" part. As much as it might seem, that is not the case. I can entirely handle the work load from such a place. The fact of the matter is this: I have a decision to get an education with work, or I have a decision to get an education with just less work. Why, in the end, should I go with the first instead of the latter? Why get the same potential education with simply more work, when you could have done it easier? Why, at all, be forced to be educated in a topic that will not come into use?   Of course, there is always the "what ifs."  What if you really need to know it? What if it does come into use? What if you're in a bad situation and you need that knowledge to get out?  Well, what if none of that matters? What if I never use that knowledge? The point being, I just don't care. You can give me all the shit you want for not muscling through this, and you can laugh at me when I'm dying because I forgot to recite the atomic weight of lanthanum, but I don't really mind. I don't want the Program to hold  it  for me while I piss. I prefer to hold it on my own, even if it means I might be peeing the wrong way.  Now, if you decide to tell me I'm making a mistake because it is too unclear and there are too many risks, let me have you know that I am aware of the possibilities. My brother went to a public school, he is graduating this year, and has received college applications from many prestigious colleges - NYU, Massachusetts, Maine, etc. The fact of the matter is that he is not any less important or worse at anything than any IB student. He simply isn't versed in a matter that was formulated for the sole purpose of the IB program. He is far more of an intellectual than most people I have ever met in IB -- he is the top of his class in Calculus, in Spanish 4, in AP Chemistry, got a very high score on his SATs -- but the thing that matters is not that he is good at remembering 150 Spanish Vocabulary words after a single night of studying, but rather that he still retains common sense, dignity and humility along with his education.   It is all too common among higher classman in IB that I see them holding up their chins, stepping on peoples toes, insulting people, simply because they can say "I did it and you didn't, so make way, simpleton." The IB program, to me, is nothing more than a badge, a say-so, a trophy of putting yourself through misery just for a self projected moment of glory. Why should I whip my own back so I can grin later when I can grin now, smile later, and keep on smiling? Its senseless to do the things to yourself that the IB program will make you do when you have plenty of it coming in the future. It is not human nature to repeat something until it becomes habitual. That is degrading yourself to the state of society's poster child. I myself will find another way to what I like, thank you very much.  The one thing I want people to get out of this essay-like expression, if anyone reads this, is that surrounding yourself with money, the reassurance of a "good education," and the ideals of modern society will not get you happiness. Do what you like. If you like being guided by a program, then go right ahead. I myself will take the road of choices. Its important to make your own mistakes. How will you ever grow if you can't learn from them, and how do you learn from them if someone is always there to catch you? Common sense comes from real-life mistakes and problems. The IB program attempts to keep you from any sort of failure on their standards. The IB program is the net below you. The IB program -- well -- just isn't for me.  Like they say, "Never let schooling get in the way of your education."

						   Two hours and thirty-four minutes left until I get to start over again. Wouldn't it be nice to rewind a couple multiples of 365 days and start over? I'm not suggesting anything, but I'm just saying it would be interesting to change decisions in the past and see how everything pans out for better or for worse.  The reason I talk about this is because I have been recently considering leaving the IB program and my current occupation of the high school in Thornton. It seems like an easy decision -- leave or go -- but to me it is more of leaving behind my past, my friends, my acquaintainces, my work, everything I have known, only to fall into another risky environment with more people I don't know and more work to be done. I say I hate a lot of my friends. I say I hate a lot of the work I get. I say I hate a lot of, well, everything. The fact of the matter is that when it boils down to a point where you absolutely need to decide if you take that left or that right, if you take the blue or the red, if you take the one or the two, you become nostalgic and critical of possibilities, you value that which you will never discuss with your inner ego.   Disagree if you will, but look back to a situation where you were knee deep in it and you could choose to go deeper or get out of the water while you still could. Now you can remember that wrenching ache in your throat, your eyes burning and pushing out from the inside, your mouth trying to keep from frowning and quivering into a state of breakdown. That is the decision you make, and that is the decision that will change the next chapter of your life  forever.   So what did you do? Did you take the road with the half completed map and the signs on the side that you get to fill in, or did you get of your car and go back to that foreign city a mile back? Either way, things are as they are now, and if they weren't, you would not be who you are today. The question at hand is whether I leave behind that map I've already drawn only to start on a new one, or I simply go with the road and fill out the signs. I don't know, its all too much to decide.  I'll let you think on that for a while I talk to potentially future-former acquaintances.

						   Another day is coming to an end. Things could have been worse, things could have been better, but its nice that things were things at all. Today at school was more than typical - meaning that everything was only more the same than it was before. Same people bugging me, same people I find myself getting angry at, same people I quietly find remorse for, regardless for the fact that I never yell at them.  I'm sure a lot of the people that read this (I actually never knew or intended for people to read this) think I'm a person-hating angry-man who finds seclusion in the dark corners of the world. Do I like solitude? Yes, I do. Do I like being alone. Sure I do. Do I like talking to people? Yeah, I do. But no, I don't. I'll talk to people, but I don't usually like prolonged social stimulation. I know I sound really "lame" and anti-social, but trust me, I'm not really like that. I just prefer my own kind of situation, which in itself makes no sense at all. That's okay, I like things that way.  I'm tired. I'll write more about this tomorrow. Sorry.

						   Here comes another day, only things have changed. With two days left before I go back to the Cage, its time to throw it in to overdrive. Only problem with that is sometimes I step on the gas before I shift, and eventually I'm bound to stall. But hey, maybe everything happens for a reason, or maybe thats just another Hollywood cliché. Either way, I know there are things to do. Am I doing them right now? Well obviously not. I can't read with thoughts in my head, so I suppose that pouring them out on to this LCD screen will help.  Last night I noticed something about a show I rarely ever watch. It's that evil one called "the Real World." I guess they were playing reruns last night of old episodes, and being that I had never really watched an episode, I tuned in for one. Now, keep in mind this was at 4:00 in the morning, and I really wanted to go to bed, I was just... you know, curious for one reason or another. So, all this stuff happens in the episode, and they leave it hanging at the end. I must say, thats a very good marketing scheme, because I watched the next rerun, and the next, and the one after that. It just kept going on until I realized it was nearly 7:00 in the morning!   I don't know what it is thats so attractive about that show, but I think I can trace it to the fact that its hilarious that those people will complain about petty problems constantly. I think that because we all have our own tiny problems, we are very intrigued to find out about other people's. Sure, I'm no philosopher (and if you consider me to be, get your head checked,) but I just believe people feel more comfortable and assured when they get to see that other people have problems too.   Who knows.  The one thing that I thought was really cool after they had shown all the episodes was that they had a special with the boyfriend of the gay guy on the show. Now, as I understand it, the guy, who was named "Paul," was a captain in the military. Bill Clinton enacted a protocol called "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," which basically means that homosexuals can serve in the military so long as they don't participate in sexual activity and they are not open about their sexual preference. I guess thats fair enough. That meant on the show, they were forced to blur out Paul's face because of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," but what he ended up admitting was that he was scared shitless. He said that there was once a murder in the barracks next to his because another soldier suspected his comrade of being homosexual, went a little (very) crazy, and beat the guy's head in with a bat. I think that is a cause for concern. He also said that potentially, just by being on that show (blurred out or not,) his career was on the line. I think it is completely wrong that a person like him who served eight long years in the country's military should be forced to blur his face out because he has a "different" opinion about sexuality.   Just goes to show how rude typical Americans can be.  I could go on and on, but for sake of your eyes and my fingers, lets just end it here.

						   Another day over, another day beginning, and I keep getting the same results -- a whole lot of nothing. I swore to myself I would do my homework today, and I started to read. I was very proud of myself. I get 20 pages in to a very short book, and I go back to play games. I need to shapen up before I crumble at the base. I don't even know what's going on anymore... I don't have any incentive to do anything -- homework, socialize, play games. Its all starting to lose its feel to me. I tried drawing today, and I put my pencil down 5 minutes later. I hope I can find something to do, because this modern lifestyle is driving me crazy.  Screw this, I'm going to play Subspace.  >

						   It has been a while, hasn't it? Tacked a four on to the end of the next three-hundred sixty-five days.  Everyone talks about what a great New Years Eve party they went to, how fun it was, how "gloriously" drunk they got. I myself think its completely foolish. Maybe I'm losing faith in people, and maybe I don't care. Maybe there's one too many "maybes" out there that I really don't care to answer. Either way, I have to say that I am becoming more and more distant from society, and I don't see a damned thing wrong with it. People irritate me -- their habits, their mindsets, the way they try to have a conversation with me and end up holding it with themselves... its all building up, and one of these days I'm going to let someone know just what the fuck has been on my mind.  But until then, I'll keep the thumbtacks in my cheeks...  How else am I supposed to hold this smile any longer?

						   People never grow up. Ever. I know that they think they do and they feel mature because they discuss cars, sports and alcohol with their megalomaniacal, gluttonous, obnoxious friends, but that says  shit  about who you are. People will always be the same. A frightened, confused little child looking for the hands of mommy, and even then, mommy doesn't know  what  the fuck is going on.   While on the note of immaturity, its such childish, petty bullshit the way these clichéd, clique alliances work - they will manipulate their friends and convince them that they need to hate a person purely because they do. If you buy into that, you are a fool. A fool without a sense of independance and a sense of opinion, because it is entirely fucked up to hate someone just because your "friend" does. Honor is a dead concept, and so is humility, thanks to people like this. So the next time your friend says "so and so is such a bitch because he/she is a transexual assclown," feel nothing short of  compelled  to disagree with them.   Well, I'm on a roll, so I guess I'll just keep ranting. I really hate people who act out disrespectfully and loudly purely to get attention and a few sold-out laughs. It bothers me a lot because these are people who live under an umbrella of virtually endless greed, and yet they ask for more, more, and still more, as if their cell phones, televisions, food, and everything else in their house isn't enough. Its such a common syndrome in this country anymore that I would love to see how they would act if their fucking mommy and daddy told them that they can't have their 250 dollar allowance.   I also hate trendy band fanboys. I saw a group of kids today sitting around, being loud and annoying, and every single one of those pigs were wearing "Fall Out Boy" shirts and jackets, thinking they are some musically enlightened group of kids who know  what is up.  You know what? They wouldn't know good music if it came up and slapped them across the face, because they wait for MTV and their friends to tell them what is and is not cool. They feel obligated to tell people that they like some generic band because they can't do it any other way. They want to feel like they are original and classy, like they discovered them first. Too bad, hundreds of thousands of sheep got their first, you're just another number.  Fuck this, I'm so irritable I just want to cut off my head.

						   My days are less than exciting. Its the same thing with only changes in clothes (sometimes) and dialogue. Nothing ever changes, and that is why the little things mean so much to me. Just a different person doing a different something always seems to make me happy.   And that is also why I sometimes loathe myself. I never change. I'm constantly an anti-social dick, and I really dislike that about myself, but I try. I try to push myself to the verge of talking to people I usually don't, but I've found that I am either socially intimdated or I just  can't  talk to certain people.  As I once told someone, sometimes I want to blow off my head, and sometimes  I don't.  Hmph.

						   After many months of reading things that the youth of this country posts, I have come to a conclusion -    The majority of us are make-believe self loathers who sulk and bask in our own fictitious sorrow until we find someone who cares. Then it just gets worse.   If you don't believe me, go read some of the things that people aged 12-18 write. Its a common attention syndrome.  But thats okay, because one day they will all look back and say "Wow, I was a very troubled, ignorant child."   And they still will be.  -HJ

						   I moved my head out of that uncomfortable position and moved my hands around in a delirious manner as if I was trying to catch a bubble. I rolled over on my back and stretched out my arms. My joints cracked and hissed at me for waking up. I had to make them understand its something you should do. So I pulled the covers back over my leg, the one that felt so awkward. It was very cold, I must have left it out all night like the cereal box downstairs. I propped myself up so I would be uncomfortable. I looked across the room at the VCR and it told me that the time was around eleven something. The last part was unclear. My eyes were still blurry from being in a dreamstate.  We all have such rapport with our body that we know not to press to hard when we're rubbing our eyes. They are a gentle thing, and they should be handled as such. After I could finally see, I moved the mouse on my computer. The screen stayed blank. I had forgotten to turn it on. I pressed the gray button, and I was flooded with thousands upon thousands of little pixels all guffawing at me because I don't have the latest hardware for my computer. I don't care.  Okay, I lied. I actually do.  So I look at my desktop. Everything on it is so tried that I don't even bother to read the title. I just look away from my screen. I went downstairs and I ate some food. Small prattle with my family ensued. I was still unamused. So I started thinking about yesterday. What the hell did I even do? Oh, that's right.  The day before had started exactly the same, but in between turning my computer on and going downstairs, I was interrupted by the presence of my mom. She informed me that we needed to take my dog to the vet, pay a visit to the grocery store, and chalk down some driving hours. I was up for it. I don't usually do much, so this was a little more eventful than my normal day. How fun.  I go downstairs to find my dog. She is laying down on a pillow, showcasing her new blue boot that covers her little bloody toenail. It is such a funny thing to see an animal in a bandage. They seem to want to make sure you are looking at it, and so they will put it right in front of you every time you see them. I reached down to pick up Jaci and she, as I said before, stuck out her little blue foot and gave me "the eye." I knew she was hurt. She knew I knew it too. So I picked her up and she didn't make a sound. I got the keys from my mom, and put the dog in with her. I went around to the other side.  After going to the vet and getting the little blue boot off, we took the dog home. She was happy and so was I. That hideous licking noise was finally out of the car. She is still a good dog. I guess you can't really stop the sun from shining, so you may as well let an injured dog lick itself.   I left one detail of the morning out. Earlier, I had told my mom that I was interested in purchasing one of those fan-dangled little MP3 players. The kind that play back my stolen music as I smile because I know I just kept my ten dollars out of some random man's pocket. Anyway, my mom said it would be okay as long as I paid for it. Of course I had to pay for it. Nothing is free. Well except for those little samples at stores and shops. We left again and headed out to Best Buy so I could fork over two hundred pieces of precious paper for a piece of plastic that blasted noise into my ear canals. It was little shiny black thing called a "Rio Nitrus" or something or another.   We left the place and went to the grocery store. My mom promised that we would not buy the typical 500 units of food, but of course, she did. And then some.  Fast forward about 45 minutes. We're going to the bank now. I'm getting out what money wasn't in my wallet to give to my mom to pay for the Nitrus. Turns out I forgot my PIN number (shows how much of a penny packer I am.) How great. Oh well, we'll figure it out tomorrow and I'll come back.  So I get home, sit down for about 30 minutes, and then I get a call from Stephen. He wants to know if I would like to go to the mall with him and some friends. Well, I just spent 200 dollars on the MP3 player, took my mom to the grocery store, and got the boot off my dog's foot. Usually a day like this is eventful enough for me, and I typically would have declined, but I guess I was feeling a little bored that day. I said sure.  So we met at the mall. It was ironic that those of us who came did not intend on spending money. We just came to come. Its such a simple idea. So we loitered for about one and a half to two hours. It was pretty fun. I mean, pretty fun considering the fact that I usually just sit at home and stare at this same computer screen.  So we left, I went to sleep, and then I started at the top of this page the next day.  I write this as if my day were really exciting, but in reality, I could have summed my day up in about 5 sentences, all of which were very bland and boring. But hey, I guess that in retrospective, this does make my day seem like it was very cool.  Very cool indeed.  P.S. - After heavy request, I have reinstalled the commenting system.

						   You know what? I'm not even going to lie to you, I'm a extremely fucking angry right now, and I will warn you, if you are offended easily, do not read what I am about to type.   Today I have been fucking aggrivated to the point of having murderous thoughts of one of the most fucking retarded assholes I have ever met. He was a stupid little cocksucker who's frequently known as the son-of-a-bitch who plays football. Now, my friend Stephen and I were minding our business, finishing homework for drivers ed, when he and his little bum chum come up and start making ignorant little comments about us doing work. I become a little more than aggrivated with his pansy little punk ass. So then he starts commenting on Asians. "PENIS THIS, PENIS THAT, HAR HAR HAR!" So now my teeth are really grinding into themselves and I want to get up and cuss the little bitch out. But I don't. I try to keep my cool. Then the bastard has the audacity to start talking about "Jews." "WHERE'S MY LITTLE JEW?!?! I CAN'T FIND HIM! HES SUCH A JEW! NO PUN INTENDED." Okay you little fucking piece of shit, I hope you're reading this, and I hope you know that right now I would love to put these ten digits around your fat slimy neck and fucking rotate your head 270 degrees in a swift, leftward motion. One day I would metaphorically love to put a pistol to your fat fucking chest and pull the trigger about six times, step on your neck, gouge your fucking eyes out, cut off your tongue, break all your teeth out, and light your stinky ass on fire.  Just goes to show you ought to be careful about who you call what, because that next "Jew" might be the one to blow off your antisimetic little pea-head.  Bastards.

						   I hate the fact that people think I'm a critical person. I make jokes about being stingy, but I'm a very very uh... what's the word... loose minded person? I don't know, its just that I feel like a lot of people think I am a person who needs to be impressed and that I remember every thing a person does. In all honesty, I overlook most everything a person does that they call 'bad.' I don't know, but I needed to get this out there. I'm really not such a stern person.   But just one more thing, it kills me when people call me "rich" or "perfect." I swear, my stomach tightens up and I get a little bit flustered about that. There's something about living in this shitty "upscale" neighborhood that drives me crazy. People think just because I live in this neighborhood that I'm some stuck-up asshole or something. I hate it, it kills me. Please try to not call me those things. Perfection is disgusting and I am extremely far away from that.  I'm sorry, I've just had a strange day. I'm not directing this message to anyone in specific, but really, just don't call me 'rich.' That is far too negative in the way it is implied. Thanks.

						   Its one o'seven in the morning and I have to wake in less than five hours. Maybe if I write some stuff I won't think so much when I try to sleep.  Recent events have encouraged me to do one thing: let go of my radical opinions and value all levels of intelligence, all types of ideas, all people of all backgrounds, and all music of every type, despite how honestly shitty I may want to believe it is. I've realized something, too: Every person wants to be some hot shit; some kind of prophet of originality who does what no one has done before. Sadly, there is nothing left to do. It's all been done. You cannot rebel entirely against society and still expect to be considered original. If anything, it is just this gigantic cliché.   I used to think that I knew what was up. I used to think that I had this level of comprehension that surpassed everyone else and honestly most people have that exact same mindset. They know it all. They know the ups and downs, the ins and outs; they know the  shit . Its hard to break it to you all, but we need to get it through our heads that we are just a carbon copy of someone who died years ago.   People say that they hate our society, yet you will find them talking to all manner of people later. They say they understand elaborate topics and can give their own insight, but you could find them browsing through books or the internet for a viable opinion. They say they loathe something, but you will later see them drooling and obsessing over that very thing. Its a stage, people. Nothing more, nothing less. You are not some amazing child with these thoughts that no human being has ever thought up. You are just feeding off of what seems attractive to you at the time and you believe with all your heart that you will for the rest of your life. It is not true, and if for some completely fucked up reason it  is,  then you are a very bad soul. A person who doesn't evolve and mature and grow is nothing special. You need to actually take into account yourfolliess and your mistakes and learn from them.   It doesn't hurt to admit you're wrong, you just kind of feel like shit for a few seconds.  The only true knowledge is admitting that you know nothing. Why? Well, its simple. You keep your mind open to what will be of value to you. You are willing to take in and digest new concepts without some preconceived notion that you already understand it. Forget it. You don't know half of half of half of the things that are of value to you. If you think you'll get by with such thoughts, you are fighting an uphill battle and you are going to lose. I don't say this because I read it in some article or book. I say it because I've actually experienced this. I have heard things that were the polar opposite of my opinion that now make complete sense to me.   It sounds very typical to many people. "Quit being such a damned follower! Get your own opinion!" If you were to stand back and look at your own opinion on things, you would find that you are an easily moldable person. Your mind is this soft blob of nothing that a person with a managed brain can easily warp. Did you ever hear your parents talk about the days when they used to be rebels? Yes, its true. Much like you, they also had their blackened glory days in which society was below them. And look at them now. To you they look like a mere shell of what they once used to be. It is not true. They are far more valuable now than they used to be. They have actually experienced things and have a reason to like or dislike them. Children are just spoon-fed this by whatever television program or song they are watching or listening to.  I'm not trying to be critical about people, I'm just trying to give what I have learned to you. I don't think you can value anything you speak of until you experience it first hand. Not death, not sorrow, not happiness, not anger. But nevertheless, I respect people who think they do. Its just a stage, and I have no right to be critical of why they are acting the way they are; neither do you. You have no reason to hate the things you do. You hate them because you feel you should. Disguise it all you want. Be brave and take your steps out into the dark unknown.   But secretly, that dark unknown is only unlit because you won't open your eyes. Do it. You will be fine.

						   I started out my day in a standard 1 square form. I showered off today and made off in early morn.  I got in my new car shiny glossy from new clean got it from the repo place took it from a cocaine queen.  But this was not important at least when I bought this car, I was surprised to have noticed that I did not get too far.  The coppers pulled me over and said "Pop your trunk, young lad." Their eyes grew the size of planets when they saw what twas I had.  The cop got in the back and said "Drive this car, young boy!" I put my foot on the pedal but did not expect the joy  Of when next we would stop  at a fancy Motel Eight, The copper could not stand it more he did not want to wait.  He went out and bought a hoe she was a fine young lass, until the cop decided  to sniff cocaine from her ass.  So I ran out the door  and to my shiny blue mobile, I dismissed what I had saw there's no way it could be real.  I will continue this story when I have the time. Until then, stay away from cops looking for your cocaine.

						   Some people will want to see me dead for what I am about to say, and I am perfectly okay with it. My opinion is my own and you are in no way forced to believe or, for that matter, read this.   God is not real.  The only real proof anyone has of his existence is a lengthy book that has been translated hundreds of times over and composed by dozens of authors -- and that's where it end.  A book.  I am sorry, but a man-written book is nothing more than a fairytale. For all matter, I could pick up the book  Clifford  and say that it was written by a respected, "truthful" writer of the times who was under the influence of the powers of the red dog, and by god (or rather, Clifford,) someone would believe it. The proof that is the Bible is simply unsubstantial for such a radical, farfetched idea like "God."   Furthermore, what exactly is "God's" problem with humanity? He 'creates' us and then punishes us for functioning as he made us. That is some seriously fucked up shit right there. That's the same as building a robot that is made to cut glass, and then telling him that cutting glass is against the principle of you. You may as well have just built the robot to sit there and do nothing.   In all honesty, the "God" in the Bible is extremely egocentric and paranoid. He basically tells people that he will slay anyone who disagrees with his ultimate power and then when people built the tower of Babel, he felt challenged and destroyed it and cursed them all.  Way to fucking go.  It doesn't stop there. He tortures people, destroys them over and over because he is unsatisfied with his "meager" work because his abominations are functioning as they were built. Humans were created in his image, so says the Bible, and that would be the one thing that would explain our irrational, violent, self-centered, attention craving, superficial emotions. Now, that in no way rationalizes the Bible -- I'm just using the text that I so disagree with as my weapon of critique.  The thing about religions like Christianity is that they have been so rigidly grafted into our society that it is everywhere around you. Take out a dollar bill, listen to the pledge of allegiance, hear a person cuss at another person, watch a porn... they all mention "God" at least once. That is why God is seen as such a simple, understandable concept in our society. You hear his name hundreds of times from the time you are little to the time you are big enough to think. There is absolutely no proof of his existence. As I have said before, I would like to see a child be raised and see if this human discovers the concept of "God." If he were so powerful, would his influence not stretch out to our consciences?   God is just a concept that frightened, confused human beings made up long ago, and it has since been enforced and perverted by modern society. Every time you turn around people are mentioning it, trying to  convert  you. It is funny that its called conversion, like you are somehow not a part of the group, regardless of the fact that "God" supposedly "made" you. All that the religion is is simply a crutch for manipulation and greed. The Church is the absolute richest organization in the world, and to me, that says at least  something  about that damned concept. But it doesn't matter, I will always be surrounded by these religion enforcers until I move to some non-western influenced area. Until then, I will be forced to put my trust in a concept that is total bullshit.  And that, "God's" sheep, is why your big buddy is a  fucking fake.   Now get his name off my money.

						   The future - You will die.  Let this sink in. Think about it. Let it hit home. Now you realize that one day you are going to end. You will be no more. Your conscience will be gone forever and all that will be left is carbon and family photos. Now you understand. You will, at one point, be nothing and this is a shock to you. Everything will progress around you, but you will be forever stuck in that one moment, not existing.   Now, how do you feel?   Good.

						   I often times become "light headed." People don't really know what I mean by that, so I intend to clear that up. It happens when I sit down for a while, and then abruptly stand up.   So what does it feel like? I stand up, and nothing feels wrong. My feet are on the ground and my mind is on something less important. But I feel it in my fingers first. They feel like they are swelling, like blooding is flowing into them and expanding them. I know something is wrong, and I stay still. My eyes open and I feel the area above them swell a bit, pressing down on my eyeballs. Next it comes to the inside of my elbows. The start to tingle and get that same expanding feeling as my digits, and now I can really feel it. My neck starts to get a lifeless, floating feeling, followed by a rush of heavy matter pressing on it. Now I'm swaying back and fourth, trying to stay up. I can't feel my knees. Then my ankles go away. I'm standing on my feet, but I have no legs, and I can't do it for much longer. My vision starts to pulse from a blurry wide area, to a sharp small area, and my head starts to float off my body. My knees buckle and I fall to the ground, but I put my hands out in time to save my face from the ground. When I'm on the ground, I get a feeling of euphoria, the kind you get when you first lie in your bed and you are very tired. I smile. I am feeling better. But that feeling is followed by a pulsating headache.  It's a very strange feeling, I kind of like it.

						   I've noticed something today. It's been a while since I've had a  real  dream. By that I mean a sequence of events in which there is a plot of some sort. I usually just have disturbingly grusome or agressive dreams. I don't know exactly what that means. Is my life stress free? Not at all. Do I have nothing to think about? That's not it.    For one reason or another, I have a hunch that I am clinically depressed. Not in the sense that I "hate life" and want to blast my face on to the wall with a 12 gague shotgun, but the sort of chemical inbalance in which I feel sort of agressive or tired towards things I used to be interested in. I don't really want people to know about my feelings about this, and I'm extremely hesitant to destroy this entry, but it feels better to get my feelings out.   So what are my reasons for thinking this? Well, sometimes I really would just rather be away from everyone and everything forever, and then when I am, I really hope I can see or talk to some people I know. It eats away at me and I make myself feel like shit because I don't know whether or not I hate humanity. I've also read that when people are depressed they will often sleep for long periods of time and have a very hard time waking up. In a way, I fit into that exactly. I sleep for 14 hours and I still have an awfully hard time waking up. Another very weird thing is that I cannot remember most of my dreams. It's like they never existed.   It's not only that - sometimes I step back and look at the big picture of my life and all I see is stress after stress after stress, and I get that occasional "better off if I was dead" feeling. I know its not right, and I know most people will wig out and interrogate me about whether or not I am hiding a loaded glock in my room for that dark night when I will blast my throat out, but the fact of the matter is that I have self control.  I'm not going to start wearing all black. I'm not going to listen to "Evanescence (sp?)," I'm not going to start cutting my wrists; I will never become that attention craving "depressed kid." I just try to get by, and I know that one day it will go away and I will be happy again. I'm not saying I'm never happy, but just not as much as I used to be a couple years ago.  So the next time you see me with my head in between my knees, or my head down on the table, please don't be concerned and try to comfort me or whatever - I'm probably just tired or irritated. So don't worry about me. I'll be fine.  I hope!

						   I sit at home in front of this monitor and my TV is never on but I am aware of what happens to me and the world and  I am reminded of the nature of my spirit in that it doesn't ever want to work and so I know that when I do work at something and I try hard to  make it happen, I feeling something there. Its easy for most people to do what they want to do and to get done what they want done but  I am bad with myself in the sense that I cannot express what I feel or what I know or what I want because  I am just not like that. But there is a time period that I will cross and there is an event I know will happen that will change all of that and  If I want something to work  I will try so hard for it and I will be happy when it finally does.

						   Everytime I find something I like that I feel comfortable with, I am asked to change. That makes me very uncomfortable. I am terrible at changing. I am who I am and people have a very hard time dealing with that.   But its not that. Its the fact that everything I feel is backwards of what people tell me. But things are so obvious to me. How could I possibly be wrong? Some people are just damned good at discouraging me I guess.  Deal with it.

						   I have half a fake tooth from an accident that happened 3 years ago. I slipped on the ice on my stairway and smashed my face into the cement, shattering my front left tooth. So I have half a fake tooth, and today I had it replaced after 3 years of stains and decay. So why should I write about this? I have no idea. But the thing that I liked about this was that I got it done and over with without trying to put it off like so many things I do.   I guess that a few things that have happened recently have sparked a lot of change in my life. I am glad for that.

						   There's something about me. Something about my personality or the way I speak or the way I look or the way I act that does something to people. Most every person I know stays cool with me for a while, but slowly and gradually distances themselves, or just flat out stops talking to me all together.  I don't get it, but whatever, I've always kind of been more content sitting at home doing nothing. I don't know why I always try to be so empathetic of other people when they end up turning my sympathy into some kind of manipulative devilry. I don't know what's wrong with me.  But I'm not going to get angry about it. It won't help anything.

						   My aunt died a couple days ago. She was 67 years old. That's a very young age to die at by today's standards, but after hearing her story, I feel a kind of solitude in her passing away. It sounds a bit macabre, but listen to her life.  Her sister or mother, one of them, was a multi-cash-millionaire, as in they have millions of dollars in cold, hard cash in the bank. She owned most all of the farming in eastern Colorado, so you can imagine how much money this woman raked in. When my aunt turned 60, her family threw her out in a farm house with no car and no telephone. She lived there all alone with no way to contact the outside world, surviving only off her wits. However, before that, her husband used to be very abusive. The kind of person who would beat his wife so bad she would lose consciousness. You can imagine how "great" her life used to be. The thing that makes no sense is that they put her away when she was only 60 years old. A multi-cash-millionaire wouldn't support her own family and so they just did away with her. Its fucking disgusting. Her last years must have been torture.  That is why I was so happy to hear she passed away. I'm sure in death she finally found peace.

						   I don't ever show much emotion over anyone, but for some reason, the way I treat this one person takes every feeling I have and squeezes them as hard as it can until my eyes start to water.

						   Sometimes I feel really terrible about the way I treat my girlfriend. I take her for granted way too much, I mean honestly. I am away from her for 9 hours and when I finally get to talk to her, I neglect her. It makes me feel like such a shallow prick, and don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I'm  not  a shallow prick, I'm just saying that its stuff like this that makes it so apparent. I don't know, maybe its just because I'm bad with words. I mean, I can write and all, but its just hard to get my thoughts out with the right words. I wish for one day that she could spectate how my day and my thoughts go so she could feel the things I feel and hear the things I am too chicken-shit to say.  Geesh, I am such an emo-fuck.

						   I am so fucking pissed off right now I can't help it. I am going to let you know what I feel like, how I want to spit out my insides and kick them into your face. How I want to take my hands and place 8 fingers on the back of your fucking head and put my thumbs so far into your eyesockets that you will be able to see the top of your skull. How I want to grab you by the neck and thrust my forehead onto yours, just hoping to hear the sound of your brain smashing against the walls of its container. How I want to flex my back so hard the muscles explode off of the bones and fall to the ground as a mess of disgusting, stinking flesh. How I want to drop kick a head into my garage. How I want to hold back someone's head and let the blade of a sharpened knife find its way inside their neck. How I want to grab you by your scalp and drag you acrossed cement, ending with a firm stomp on your esophagus. How I want to make you kneel down and introduce you to an aluminum baseball bat.    How I want this fucking feeling to go away.

						   Its so typical that the last several days of anything long will dwindle slowly and painfully, inevitably; school is no exception to this rule. Classes become more boring, clocks go only 1/3 as fast as they used to, and people become 3 times more irritating. But, fortunately for me, I know that there is always one thing that brightens up these lengthy days. I like it because whenever it comes along I can't help but get energetic. Everything is so much better and quicker and more enjoyable. Classes are more fun, humor is better, smiles are easier, but unfortunately, time goes by so much faster. What a  fucking  shame.   I wish I could just trick myself into thinking it was a miserable experience and let the placebo effect slow time down, all the while I am secretly enjoying her company like I always do. Yes, that one thing that brightens up such shitty days is a her and she has a name: Heather. It's been such a long while since I've even considered being involved remotely with anyone, but this last month or two has been one of the most enjoyable of my life, and I say this in all honesty. I wouldn't trade any second of it for anything, and I realize that to me that is such a big deal. There are very few things I can enjoy so much. It seems weird, but I even enjoy the anger and the "abuse," the pity and the loathing, the make-believe insults and the efforts to make me look like a fool (which seem to work quite a bit.) Yes, to other people it seems very awkward, but I know that it's all just there for poking fun.   So I hope for these last days, and all the last days after that, I will feel this way.   Woo.

						   There's a feeling I get when I know something bad is coming up, something that's going to bite me in the ass.

						   There is a person I know. The thought of not being with this person is something that makes me feel quite sick inside. I hate it so much because this person has been the best thing to happen to me for a few years. But lately, things have been happening and the future is uncertain. What makes me so sick might soon become a reality.  I see two things as time will progress. I see this blog talking about the misery and suffering of getting over it, but secondly, I see this blog talking about the many days of happiness and contentment that this person still has to bring to me.  Do like I did, and ask yourself, which one would be better to read? The answer is quite obvious.  Sad endings are such a fucking cliché.

						   Have you ever been waiting for something? Have you ever been anticipating that you'll see something or find something you've been hoping for? Yeah, well I'm in that position right now. I'm waiting for someone. I can't hear them or see them right now (and to be totally honest, I don't know what the circumstance is around that,) but I would give anything I have for that person I am waiting for to be right next to me, at least talking to me. Everything I see my mind takes and filters out the truth, hoping it can somehow change a shirt on the floor of my brother's room into one of the belongings of her's.   What can I do but wait? I can't wait anymore. This is killing me inside and out. I'm afraid to go outside to do chores because the phone might ring and it might be her. I'm a afraid to shower because I might not hear the doorbell. I'm afraid that she's gone somewhere and it isn't safe right now. I'm afraid I'm not going to see her for quite a while.  Where the fuck is she, anyway?

Why is it so hard for me to control my anger? Why was I born under this curse?   I want a person to watch me walk. I do it wrong. I want a person to listen to me talk. I do that wrong too. I want a person to watch me sleep. I would wager a pretty penny that I do that wrong. So, tell me, you,   What is right?   I want to know. I want to know so bad. What the hell is this whole "correct," "yes," "good," "well done," "right," shpeel that you people always seem to come across and why can I not seem to figure it out? Is the god damned world that I live in just devoid of  right?  Is there nothing I can do that is the way it should be done? Just stop accusing me for one small second and tell me... what is right? I feel so right on the inside, but it always comes out so damn   wrong!    If it takes a shovel to my head or a bullet to my foot to get me to understand this, trust me when I tell you that I would choose it. The reasons are many and abundant, and if I can't figure this out, time will, in a very, very bad way. Please help me, I am losing a battle that cannot (at this rate) possibly be won, but the prize is far too precious to be lost.   Help me before it's too late.   P.S. - When I maintain radio silence, that's when everything is more or less OK. I only ever blog about bad things, because I know from experience that it is a helluva lot more boring to read about how "wonderful" someone's life is. Wahh, ignorance is bliss.

						    urlLink    I bought DOOM 3 about 2 days ago. These are   the few shots that will actually display what the game is like without seeing it in action.  Posted by  urlLink Hello

						   Today was possibly the worst day of my entire life. It all started when I woke up this morning... My sister walks in to my room, drunk off her ass and starts yelling at me about who knows what. So, I get up and she pushes me. I fall down and break my glasses. My brand new 250 dollar glasses. That's not all, it's far from over. My girlfriend calls me and she tells me that she's going to Arizona for two weeks. So the whole day, I'm completely bummed out.. I figure I'll take a nice scorching hot shower. I get in, and the water is freezing cold. To top it all off my mom announces that she thinks she's pregnant. She can't be pregnant, right? I hope to god this is a false alarm. I'm so irritable, I want to shoot myself in the face.  ________________________________________________________  EDIT: Can the real HJ please stand up?
