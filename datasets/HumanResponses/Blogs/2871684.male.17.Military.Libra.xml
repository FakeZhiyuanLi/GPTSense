      lastnight was pretty exciting......... why is it that when you say you love someone and you want them to be with you but they hate yer guts, so you bug the crap out of them and make them hate you more?? i mean if you really love them wouldnt u want them to come to like you? this all came up cause this jerk has been following my friend.   this morning i got up at 7 and my first class starts at 8. then right before i turn into the colleges' drive my car decides to quit in the middle of the road!! rggg  lastnight i had many things on my mind. im always being told "go out and enjoy life." what does that mean? i know that sounds like a stupid question. for some reason for along time now everything has seemed sureal to me. cause like big events will happen and ill jus take it and run if its good or turn it off if its bad. for example, like 3 months ago i got dumped by my GF, and you all go yea waawaa you baby it happens to eveybody, it brought up tons of questions for me. because you tell your GF that you love her then you dump her and vice versa. i mean what is this?? is it jus that i got too attached too earlly?? cause i cant stop thinking about her......... does everyone feel this way? is that why everyone finds a new GF/BF as fast as posible? to dull the pain, quell the questions, "does this make sense?", going out with tons of ppl? having feelings for all of them and not coming to grips with all of any of the consequenses? this really hurts to think that if or when i find "the right girl." (which by the way is another question of mine.) that there will be my previous GF in the back of my mind that i still think about, and her previous BFs that she thinks about. now about finding the person the i can see that a little easyer. cause i think that if ive known the girl long enough then i might start to like her. but then id lose a good friendship. and what are the advantages of getting married? i mean if your good enough friends then youll keep in touch anyways right? then theres all the special taxes, all the fights......... i know those are lame excuses. but still they are there. i know its kinda early to be thinking about all of this right now. but i cant get it off my mind. i know you could say that "dude you need to find someone to love and get your mind off of yourself." and my question would be 1st what is love and shouldnt i change BEFORE i go into any relationship? cause if love is just caring the i care about alot of ppl, males and females. dang...........well i gotta get some homework done

      Well it seems that all these questions have come back to me. But I still cant answer them.  What is the point of going out with someone. Why when you say you love someone do you play games with them? This all came back cause the other day I was on aim with my best friend and he was talking to his GF or whatever you want to call her. Hah anyway this girl is EXs’ little sister. Maybe that would explain why she is being so immature. Or are all girls that way? I would hope that they’re not. I know that when my friend talks about how they tease each other, they come back and say their sorry. I guess it just depends on the ppl. Rrrrrrrrgggggg THIS ALL MAKES NO SENSE!!!!!!!!! Why do emotions have to be so stupid. Granted they are all cool when its just you. Or when your hanging out with friends of both sexs. But when you get into a “relationship” with someone then like it all goes blah. At least from my experience. Of course I can be wrong. ………………….. man. I run both ways. I want to be loved and love. But I gotta wonder, am I really feeling this? Am I fooling myself as is what happened before……. Sometimes I cant even put the thoughts and feelings into words. I can chase myself in circles forever. It’s a in my head. This is a game. And I can treat it that way till some other poor soul dares to enter my world and try to………uh love me I guess. Then I get lost I don’t understand this stuff. Its easyer to run from it than hurt and get hurt trying to understand it, or just ignore it, but isn’t that the same thing? Whatever, semantics. But then I might hurt someone. If some crazy girl decides that she loves me and I ignore her. But then its not my responsibility to make her happy. Rrrrrggggggg this where I am. Lost.  But still trudging on.  The weary wonderer.

      (True story from a proud mother)    As some of you may know, one of my sons serves in the military.  He is still stateside, here in California.  He called me yesterday to let me know how warm and welcoming people were to him, and his troops, everywhere he goes, telling me how people shake their hands, and thank them for being willing to serve, and  fight, for not only our own freedoms but so that others may have them also.    But he also told me about an incident in the grocery store he stopped at yesterday, on his way home from the base.  He said that ahead of several people in front of him stood a woman dressed in a burkha.  He said when she got to the cashier she loudly remarked about the US flag lapel pin the cashier wore on her smock.  The cashier reached up and touched the pin, and said proudly, "Yes, I always wear it."    The woman in the burkha then asked the cashier when she was going to stop bombing her countrymen, explaining that she was Iraqi.    A gentleman standing behind my son stepped forward, putting his arm around my son's shoulders, and nodding towards my son, said in a calm and gentle voice to the Iraqi woman: "Lady hundreds of thousands of men and women like this young man have fought and died so that you could stand here, in MY country and accuse a check-out cashier of bombing your Countrymen.  It is my belief that had you been this outspoken in YOUR OWN country we wouldn't need to be there today.  But, hey, if you have now learned how to speak out so loudly and clearly I'll gladly pay your way back to Iraq so you can straighten out the mess you are obviously here to avoid."

      Virtually anyone can be a Democrat; just simply quit thinking and vote that  way. But if you want to be a GOOD Democrat, there are some necessary  prerequisites. Compare the list below and see how you rate.    1. You have to believe the AIDS virus is spread by a lack  of federal funding.    2. You have to believe that the same teacher who can't teach 4th graders how to read is somehow qualified to teach those same kids about sex.    3. You have to believe that guns, in the hands of law-abiding  Americans, are more of a threat than U. S. nuclear weapons  technology in the hands of Chinese communists.    4. You have to believe that there was no art before Federal funding.    5. You have to believe that global temperatures are less affected by  cyclical, documented changes in the earth's climate, and more affected by yuppies driving SUVs.    6. You have to believe that gender roles are artificial but being homosexual  is natural.    7. You have to be against capital punishment but support abortion on demand.    8. You have to believe that businesses create oppression and  governments create prosperity.    9. You have to believe that hunters don't care about nature, but loony  activists from Seattle do.    10. You have to believe that self-esteem is more important than actually  doing something to earn it.    11. You have to believe the military, not corrupt politicians, start wars.    12. You have to believe the NRA is bad, because it supports  certain parts of the Constitution, while the ACLU is good, because it  supports certain parts of the Constitution.    13. You have to believe that taxes are too low, but ATM fees are too high.    14. You have to believe that Margaret Sanger and Gloria Steinem are more  important to American history than Thomas Jefferson, George Washington or Thomas Edison.    15. You have to believe that standardized tests are racist, but racial  quotas and set-asides aren't.    16. You have to believe that Hillary Clinton is really a lady.    17. You have to believe that the only reason socialism hasn't  worked anywhere it's been tried, is because the right people  haven't been in charge.    18. You have to believe conservatives telling the truth belong in jail, but a  liar and sex offender belongs in the White House.    19. You have to believe that homosexual parades displaying drag, transvestites  and bestiality should be constitutionally protected and manger scenes at  Christmas should be illegal.    20. You have to believe that illegal Democratic Party funding by the Chinese  is somehow in the best interest of the United States.    So, VOTE DEMOCRATIC... It's easier than getting a job!

      it seems that when you're younger being grown up is like the best thing in the world. but then when you get there its just a mindless repition of rituals to earn money and continue your existance. i know that i am really tired of college but im sure ill be ready for more by the time summer is over cause ill be BORED lol but then its also pretty boring of there is no one for you to share your life with and i dont mean i girlfriend/boyfriend i mean like just a close friend that is always there fer ya. i cant say that i have anyone like that right now. i have friends sure but no one that i can talk to about everything :P

      Since ive started this english 101 class at college ive started to notice how i talk and jus how un adaquate the words i use are to describe the stuff im talkin about. no im not talkin about love or pain. im talkin about stuff that i think is kool or things that i like. and i sometimes i dont even know why i think its kool. it just is and thats all that matters. yesterday i said sumtin was "gay" and my mom asked me how it was gay. she alsways tries to say "oh does that mean its happy" when gay doesnt mean happy anymore and ya sure it says that in websters bible but NO one i  know uses it that way anymore. anyway. for me gay means everything opposite to wat is kool or right. i know thats not very diffinitive but thats wat i came up with. there is no word like gay to roll stupid nasty and fubar all into one and is a word that is not yet profain. thats jus some of the things ive been thinkin about. no not JUS that word but how i talk as a whole. that conversation is jus wat brought it to my fore thought. well talk to yall later.

      i should stop getting free time on my hands cause i always start thinking about stuff. just watever comes into my head mostly questions about life and everything. it drives me crazy. i always hate to think that i might screw up so i dont do much and then when i do it haunts me forever never forgiving myself. i was watching bicentenial man the other night and when da grl was talkin to the robot about making mistakes as human and part of life and to learn from them and to experience them.... i dunno it jus kinda hit me over the head and got me thinking. but i have other over riding questions that will never go away as long as i live i dont know if im jus weird and i should just keep them to myself or if other ppl have them too and jus dont talk about them and deal with them or it. :P it drives me crazy though. when i try to sleep its like BAM there it is. i guess thats why i try to keep busy. but during the summer its a little hard to do that with out a car haha. id be working on it right now but its way to stinking hot out so im gonna wait till later then do some more then.

      The Guys' Rules   Finally, the guys' side of the story.  We always hear "the rules" from the female side. Now here are the rules from the male side.  These are our rules!   Please note... these are all numbered "1" ON PURPOSE!   1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up,  you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.   1. Sunday sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.   1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.   1. Crying is blackmail.   1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!   1. Yes, and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.   1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.   1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.   1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.   1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.   1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.   1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.   1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.   1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.   1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.   1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.   1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.   1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.   1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.   1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine...Really.   1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.   1. You have enough clothes.   1. You have too many shoes.   1. I am in shape. Round is a shape.   1. Thank you for reading this. Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight; but did you know men really don't mind that? It's like camping.

      Little Red Hen Gets an Education  Once upon a time, on a farm in Indiana , there was a little red hen who scratched about the barnyard until she uncovered quite a few grains of wheat. She called all of her neighbors together and said, "If we plant this wheat, we shall have bread to eat. Who will help me plant it?" "Not I," said the cow. "Not I," said the duck. "Not I," said the pig. "Not I," said the goose. "Then I will do it by myself," said the little red hen. And so she did; The wheat grew very tall and ripened into golden grain. "Who will help me reap my wheat asked the little red hen"? "Not I," said the duck. "Out of my classification," said the pig. "I'd lose my seniority," said the cow. "I'd lose my unemployment compensation," said the goose. "Then I will do it by myself," said the little red hen, and so she did. At last it came time to bake the bread. "Who will help me bake the bread?" asked the little red hen. "That would be overtime for me," said the cow."I'd lose my welfare benefits," said the duck. "I'm a dropout and never learned how," said the pig. "If I'm to be the only helper, that's discrimination," said the goose. "Then I will do it by myself," said the little red hen. She baked five loaves and held them up for all of her neighbors to see. They wanted some and, in fact, demanded a share. But the little red hen said, "No, I shall eat all five loaves." "Excess profits!" cried the cow. "Capitalist leech!" screamed the duck. "I demand equal rights!" yelled the goose The pig just grunted in disdain. And they all painted "Unfair!" picket signs and marched around and around the little red hen, shouting obscenities. Then a government agent came, he said to the little red hen, "You must not be so greedy." "But I earned the bread," said the little red hen. "Exactly," said the agent. "That is what makes our free enterprise system so wonderful. Anyone in the barnyard can earn as much as he wants. But under our modern government regulations, the productive workers must divide the fruits of their labor with those who are lazy and idle." And they all lived happily ever after, including the little red hen, who smiled and clucked, "I am grateful, for now I truly understand." But her neighbors became quite disappointed in her. She never again baked bread because she joined the "party" and got her bread free. And all the Democrats smiled. 'Fairness' had been established. Individual initiative had died, but nobody noticed; perhaps no one cared..... as long as there was free bread that "the rich" were paying for. Bill Clinton is getting $12 million for his memoirs. Hillary got $8 million for hers. That's $20 million for memories from two people, who for eight years, repeatedly testified, under oath, that they couldn't remember anything. IS THIS A GREAT COUNTRY, OR WHAT?

      A copy of this was mailed to John Kerry's web site. An official replywas received but said NOTHING about this letter nor any of the concernsit raises. Please mail this to ALL the people you know who vote. Theydeserve the truth!!! Soldier's Letter to KerryDear Senator Kerry:Since it has become clear that you will probably be the Democraticnominee for President, I have spent a great deal of time researchingyour war record and your record as a professional politician. Thereason is simple, you aspire to be the Commander in Chief who would lead mysons and their fellow soldiers in time of war. I simply wanted to knowif you possess the necessary qualifications to be trusted in that respect.You see, I belong to a family of proud U.S. veterans. I was a Captainin the Army Reserve, my father was a decorated Lieutenant in World War II;and I have four sons who have either served, or are currently servingin the military. The oldest is an Army Lieutenant still on active duty inAfghanistan after already being honored for his service in Iraq. Theyoungest is an E-4 with the military police. His National Guard unitjust finished their second tour of active duty, including six months inGuantanamo Bay. My two other sons have served in the national guardand the navy. In looking at your record I found myself comparing it not only to thatof my father and my sons, but to the people they served with. My fatherserved with the 87th Chemical Mortar Battalion in Europe. They landedon Utah Beach and fought for 317 straight days including the CherbourgPeninsula, Aachen, the Hurtgen Forest, and the Battle of the Bulge. You earned a Silver Star in Vietnam for chasing down and finishing off awounded and retreating enemy soldier. My father won a Bronze Star forsingle handedly charging and knocking out a German machine gun nestthat had his men pinned down. You received three purple hearts for whatappears to be three minor scratches. In fact you only missed a combinedtotal of two days of duty for these wounds. The men of my father'sunit, the 87th, had to be admonished by their commanding officerbecause: "It has been brought to our attention that some men arecovering up wounds and refusing medical attention for fear of beingevacuated and permanently separated from this organization..." It wasalso a common problem for seriously wounded soldiers to go AWOL fromhospitals in order to rejoin their units. You used your three purplehearts to leave Vietnam early.My oldest boy came home from Iraq with numerous commendations and thenproceeded to volunteer to go to Afghanistan and from there back to Iraqagain. My sons and father have never had anything but the highestregard and respect for their fellow soldiers. Yet, you came home topublicly charge your fellow fighting men with being war criminals and tourge their defeat by the enemy. You even wrote a book that had a coverwhich mocked the heroism of the U.S. Marines who raised the flag onIwo Jima. Our current crop of soldiers has a philosophy that no one getsleft behind; and they have practiced that from Somalia to thebattlefields of the Middle East. Yet as chairman of a Senate committeelooking into allegations that many of your fellow servicemen had beenleft behind as prisoners in Vietnam, you chose to defend the brutalVietnamese regime. You even went so far as to refer to the families ofthe POWs and MIAs as Professional malcontents, conspiracy mongers, conartists, and dime-store Rambos.As a Senator you voted against the 1991 Gulf War, and have repeatedlyvoted against funds to supply our troops with the best equipment, andagainst money to improve our intelligence capability. I find thisparticularly ironic since as a Presidential candidate you are highlycritical of our pre-war intelligence in Iraq. However, you did vote toauthorize the President to go to war, but have since proceeded to doeverything you can to undermine the efforts of our government and ourtroops to win. Is this what our fighting men and women can expect ofyou if you are their Commander in Chief? Will you gladly send them to war,only to then aid the enemy by undermining the morale of our troops andcutting off the weapons they need to win?Our country is at war Senator, and as has been the case in every warsince the American Revolution, a member of my family is serving theircountry during the war Now you want me to trust you to lead my sons inthis fight.Sorry Senator, but when I compare your record to those who have foughtand died for this nation, and are currently fighting and dying, theanswer is not just no, but Hell No!Sincerely,Michael Connelly February 14, 2004 Dallas, Texas

      wat has this society come to. my sis was jus watchin 20/20 and they were interviewing this guy about why hes suing some bar for bein discriminatory cause they were having a grls night out. this used to be something kool. a night when the ladys get treated a little more special. so they went around to some bars an interviewed some ppl. the girls were like im sure no one cares, an mosta the guys were like "i think its stupid that girls are gettin sumthing that guys arent". what is going on here? i mean common!! are we a bunch of little 4 yr olds MOMMY HE GOT SOMETHING THAT I DIDNT!!! so you want everything that girls get is that what yer saying? all these load mouth liberals that dont have backbone. tearin the country apart is what they are doing. i hope they are happy when women get equal rights in the gang tribes when all law breaks down. cause EVERYone has to be protected. the criminal justice system is so screwed up in this country. but back to my original rant. is it discriminatory for us to have a kids menu to? or senor ppl discount? i mean life isnt fair and wats wrong with givin ppl that deserve a break a break sometimes. cause if everybody gets it then u hardly appreciate it as much. mosta the time that is. but me an my friend got some ideas bout how how some of the criminals should be punished for certain things. his blog is the world denominator.  :) i cant remember them all at the moment but i will post them later. im sure they would lower the crime rate but we would here lots more yellin and whinin from ppl like kerry who scratched himself to get his gay purple hearts to get sent home!!!

      This is something to think about! Since America is typically represented by an eagle. Saddam and Ben Laden should have read up on their Muslim passages... The following verse is from the Quran, (the Islamic Bible) Quran (9:11) -- For it is written that a son of Arabia would awaken a fearsome Eagle The wrath of the Eagle would be felt throughout the lands of Allah and lo, while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced; for the wrath of the Eagle cleansed the lands of Allah; and there was peace. Note the verse number!)

      The ballad of Big Bad John ... (Kerry)       (author unknown)Every mornin' on the Hill you could see him arrive Standing six-foot-four, weighing one-twenty-five Kinda' scrawny at the shoulders and lacking a spine And when he spoke at all, it was mainly to whine ( Big John, Big John ) Big Bad John  Nobody seems to know what's in John's soul His 'beliefs' are based on the latest poll 'Though he'll say what it takes to get your votes It's the leftist agenda that he really promotes - Big John.  Some one said he came from Boston town Where he joined the Navy and gained renown 'Earning' three purple hearts and one bronze star The home folks said, "This boy will go far" ( Big John, Big John ) Big Bad John ( Big John )  Then came a day back in '71 When he renounced all the medals that he had won Then turned against his country and his Navy friends And sold them out for his own selfish ends ( Big John )  He appeared before Congress and on left-wing talk shows Giving aid and comfort to America's foes It was clear to see whose side he was on Some say he helped cause the fall of Saigon - Big John ( Big John, Big John ) Big Bad John ( Big John ) He claims to be for the working poor Yet he owns 5 mansions from shore to shore He never had to work a day in his life 'cause he learned it helps to have a wealthy wife! - Big John  Now he wants to be our next President and Commander-in-chief of those he resents: The American soldiers who fight and die To give him the freedom to tell us his lies ( Big John, Big John ) Big Bad John ( Big John )  Thousands have sacrificed their young lives To help ensure that our nation survives A vote for Kerry is a slap in the face To all the brave soldiers that he's disgraced  FADE (! Big John, Big John ) Big Bad John ( Big John )    "John Kerry met with Ralph Nader last week. Both sides of every issue were discussed. And then, Nader spoke." - Jay Leno
