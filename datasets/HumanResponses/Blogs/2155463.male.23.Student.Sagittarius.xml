						   I hate getting down and/or depressed...I don't know why, but when I get like that all I can think about it philosophy.  Seriously, all these random philosophical questions just keep coming up, and the damning part is that I can't seem to answer any of them.  So I'm stuck just trying to sort them out, trying to find some reason within my madness...and I get so fatigured that I just decide to try to stop thinking, something which obviously isn't the greatest for the my studying during such periods :-P  But even when I try to rest I can't stop thinking...my mind is like a freaking engine that I just can't shut down...so not only do I get mentally fatigued, but physically too (b/c I can't get to sleep b/c I'm thinking...).  And I get so withdrawn...it just seems like everything folds inward.  I've pretty much learned to keep my mouth shut when I get like that (and when I'm really tired)...while I probably say my most insightful and truthful things when I like that, I also end up saying a lot of things that I don't really think through or didn't really want to be known.  But when I don't say anything I feel even more withdrawn, which makes me angry with myself, which makes me more determined not to open my mouth so I don't say anything stupid...I think you can see the cycle there.  It's really frustrating.  And the worst thing is that even when I capture a positive thought, a positive moment, a logical stream, I just can't escape the sense of hopelessness and loneliness.  Sometimes I wonder if it all isn't just philosophical / theological...whether these kinds of moments expose the true realities of life, either that there isn't a God and life is truly nihilistic, or that there is a God and I'm just not committed enough to finding out who He is.  And it seems that all I can do is try to wait it out...I haven't found anything that really helps me get out of these funks...  Grr...the last couple of months were so good, I thought I was getting over this...  Anyway...now that I've rambled on about how weird I am, on to more important things.  I got my resume finished last night and started to work on my cover letter for my internships, so now I need to start figuring out which places I want to work at.  This could be a tough decision - on the one hand I want to work with someplace that's relatively particular to Washington and which has the same beliefs that I do (like a Christian advocacy group or something), but on the other hand I want to work with a group that is in the field of law I want to go into (like an inner-city law firm or something).  Who knows, maybe I'll find something that's both...?  Oh, and just as a little tag-on here, I think I finally figured out the most basic theological question that keeps tripping me up - "Why did God create humans with  full knowledge  that the vast majority would reject Him and spend eternity in Hell?"  I just can't get over this...if anyone has any good answers to this, let me know...

						   Industrial leaf-blowers are a wonderful thing...my aunt Chris brought one over tonight and we did Grandma's yard, and it's absolutely amazing to me how much it helped!  I swear, if we would have had one of these when I lived at home we could have precluded so many fights...:-P  Oh yeah...went with Mortar Board to King Kennedy last night to help with the library project.  We kinda underestimated the scope of the project (we were going to try to organize all the books), so I think we only got about 2/5 done, but it was fun.  Of course, everyone there probably thinks that I'm just some big mute since I didn't talk much, but that's pretty much my pattern in groups I'm not used to.  In fact, I was thinking about it today...I think that my level of timidity/boisterousness is directly related to what I perceive my role and status in a group to be and how comfortable I am in it.  Case in point:  I'm not real used to hanging out with the Mortar Board or Tau Sigma folks, so I doubt that I've said more then 10 words in any of our meetings or activities.  Volleyball with the Robinson gang during the summers, on the other hand, I seriously can't shut up (as much as I might wish I would, sometimes :-P).  So anyway...I'm working on WPNI stuff tonight.  I think I have my resume done, but I need to really start getting serious about looking for internships; time is passing way too fast.  I got an e-mail from someone from Senator DeWine's office asking me about funding information, but I'm holding off on getting back to him until I have my financial aid info back from Kent.    Of course, on the other hand I need MORE time to work on Lianda stuff...it looks like our surveillance audit is going to be sometime in early-January, so that would mean we would have our internal audit sometime in later-November or early-December.  I need to do a LOT of work before we're ready, but I just don't see it happening right now because of all the schoolwork I need to do.  Oh, and speaking of doing schoolwork, I don't know what it is but it seems like I'm reading at about 1/3 of the pace that I used to.  As I was joking with someone the other day, I think it's because I'm actually trying to understand what I'm reading :-P  But this is seriously something that I'm going to need to fix before I start law school...I think I might take a speed-reading course during next summer.  Speaking of law school...I finally got out my letter of recommendation requests to my two profs! :)  Now I just need to get the other one to Shawn (my boss), but he leaves for China early next week...better get my butt in gear.  Oh, and I got an invitation to apply to Case Law School the other day (and a waiver of the application fee), so my dad will be glad to hear about that (he seems to like Case).  Aside from that...I don't know what it is about California law schools, but I seem to get something from one of them about every other day.  Sometimes they sure look tempting, though...sunny days, warm temperatures, beautiful beaches, the ocean, hot girls (oh, wait, did I say that?!)...that would be awesome (if I could put up with the snakes, scorpions, pollution, and Californians...on second thought, I'll stay in Ohio...we have enough hot girls, and they're NICE :-P).  Now where's that brochure from the school in Florida?...

						   NO...NOT TECHNO!!!  A scary thing is happening...I'm listening to techno.  I've never done this before; it's a totally new experience, kinda like when I took up country last summer :-P  I blame it all on The Matrix.  Jay had a copy of the soundtrack for the first and second ones (and I'm anxiously awaiting getting my hands on the third!); I liked the movies, so I had him burn me copies.  A few of the tracks on there were semi-techno (actually, my FAVORITE type of techno is the classical-techno mix, but I'm having a hard time finding more of them than were on the soundtrack), and I absolutely loved them - perfect driving music.  So anyway, hoping to find some more like what's on the soundtrack I jump on Kazaa and download a few more tracks from the artists who did them in The Matrix (btw...I love Don Davis, he's the next John Williams).  Unfortunately, I don't find a whole lot more like what's on the soundtrack (i.e. the classical-techno stuff), although Aphex Twin had a couple of ones that were pretty close.  But some of the stuff I downloaded was more hard-core techno (if there is such a thing), and one day I just highlighted all the files I had downloaded and started playing them while I was studying (I figured I should listen to them sometime if I downloaded them!).  I startled myself - some of the stuff I liked.  Now I have to admit, my prior exposure to techno was pretty much Enya and the like (i.e. unfavorable to me!); but this stuff was different, it was cool.  Not something that I would listen to all the time, but good study and driving music.  So needless to say, having the obsessive compulsion I have to further expand upon something that I like (especially when it's FREE to do so :-D), I ventured upon downloading more.  As you might guess, this is cyclical; right now I have no idea how many files I have on my computer.  The point of all this mindless miscellany is...well, I'm not sure, something about me suddenly liking techno (to a degree).  Oh, and if anyone knows about any good groups with the classical/techno (or classical/rock) mix, let me know about them!  Ok, back to studying.  As Homer Simpson would say, "I am smart!  I am smart!  S-M-R-T.  Doh!  I mean, S-M-A-R-T!"  :-D

						   NAP THOUGHTS  I took a nap today, a very good thing :)  This whole daylight-savings time is just making me (and a lot of people I know) very tired in the mid-afternoon...bah!  Anyway, as I was drifting off (you know, in that semi-asleep haze) a thought popped into my head that I really never appreciated before.  Sometimes I like to play around with certain issues in my head when I'm drifting like that (something that keeps me awake for far too long sometimes), and arguments concerning spiritual relativism (and relativism in general) are one of them.    So suddenly it occurred to me that the primary spiritual leaders of every other religion in the world went to Hell - a morbid thought on one hand, yet something that should have been so obvious to me that it was startling to realize I had never thought about it before.  Ghandi, Mohommed, Smith, Buddha, Confuscious - as much as we might sometimes look at the teachings of any of them and see wise insights into human character or interaction (I certainly think that non-Christians can make viable insights into humanity based upon reason, although virtually all of their spiritual maxims are flawed), the end result of all their teachings was that they went to Hell.  And everyone who follows their teachings is headed in the same direction.  So that got me to thinking about an analogy that Joe gave in his sermon on Sunday, one that I really liked.  A lot of the time Christianity is labeled as exclusive because it holds that it is the only way; however, it's actually quite the opposite.  There are no requirements for becoming a Christian, no rules and regulations that you have to meet before you "meet the grade," nothing you had to do in a "past life," no out-of-body experiences you have to have to confirm your faith.  It's perfectly inclusive; all who come in genuine faith are accepted.  The analogy Joe gave was of the Browns having a game and the owner declaring that he was going to open Gate A (and only Gate A) and anyone who wanted to come could get in free of charge (imagine that the stadium didn't have a seating capacity).  But over at Gate C are a group of people waiting in line with money; when the usher comes over and points out that Gate C isn't going to open and that they can enter for free at Gate A, they refuse to enter through there because they want to get good seats and pay for them.  Even after the usher explains again to them that Gate C isn't going to open and access through Gate A is free, they continue to wait.  Who would claim that the Browns owner was being exclusive because he didn't open Gate C?

						   IMPRESSIONS FROM INDIA  You ever have one of those church services that just leaves you questioning what's really important in your life?  Yeah, well, that was yesterday...and I got to listen to the sermon 4 times (I was doin video) :-P  If you want to hear the sermon, go here (http://www.hudsonchapel.org - go to the "Resources" link, then the "Sermons" link - it was the sermon on 10/26).  Joe (our pastor) had just gotten back from India, and he was sharing about his experiences while there.  He was traveling with a medical missions team, but the Indian group there were working with had tried a novel idea in reaching the Indians with the love of Christ.  Basically, instead of going in to "convert" people from the "Hindu team" to the "Christian team," they simply go in and love people, and in doing so truly express the love of Christ that makes Him so appealing, holy, etc.  In my opinion, they strip Christianity of all its pomp and circumstance and get down to the heart of the matter - that God loves people, and that we are still  here for that very reason (i.e. to love people as God loves them).  Joe also shared about how India recently instituted a "non-conversion" law - basically, it's illegal to convert people to Christianity.  And then he shared how the work of the Christians there is so powerful, that what they do is so good for the community, that the people just aren't willing to turn them in.  After one church service the "head man" of a region (a Hindu) stood up after the service and actually told people to come to church because of what the Christians had been doing there!  One thing that really struck Joe (and I) was what his interpreter told him while they were going through a village:  "The people of this village will not say anything bad about Christians because of what we have done here."  And these people aren't highly educated (or even highly literate, for that matter), and yet God is using them so powerfully simply because they have allowed themselves to become vessles of love, not of knowledge or reason or economy.  And the point of it all was that even when the doors seem closed, when they say you can't witness in the schools, or at work, or wherever, that doesn't mean that the doors are closed - it simply means that you have to be SO GOOD at what you do and how you treat people that they don't want to "turn you in."  And relatedly, if they do, what's more important to you?  Who or what is your high commander?  And of course, this all got me thinking about me.  In many ways, the challenge to love people is difficult for me; I feel like I hardly even know what that means, and I have even less idea about how to do it.  Maybe that's because I'm still trying to come to grips with what it's going to take to go all-in as a Christians, not as a devotion to a moral code or a set of "good ideas," but a relationship that permeates ALL areas of my life.  And I just feel that this isn't the case right now...I still struggle with living how I know I should because of what the "consequences" might be, of saying what I know to be true because I'm afraid it will offend someone.  Ironically enough, I think that being a Christian sometimes requires being irreverent...of ignoring the societal norms and conditions and simply getting to the real basics of life.  I was thinking about it, and do you have any idea how much of an impact we could have if all of the Christians in this nation actually lived with a consuming Christianity?  If we all got over our inhereted American ego-centrism and looked out for other people with the love that Christ has for us?  If we all were SO GOOD at our jobs that they couldn't imagine having someone else do them (and that doesn't mean that you have to be the most capable or the most intelligent - but in many ways, simply that you have the most care and work the hardest)?  I have to admit, I think that might be one of the greatest challenges I've ever heard in my life.  I was reading a book the other day (I think it was Wild at Heart) and I read the quote "men must either be challenged or entertained."  And how true is this!  How few of us feel challenged or challenge others?  Not I.  Thus, we seek entertainment - how often do we feel empty, useless, because we have spent all morning/day/evening doing nothing but ingesting what we know has no lasting value?  If Christians spent as much time reading the Bible and studying as they do watching TV...well, you get the idea.  This is probably a more critical and introspective posting than I originally intended, but I hope y'all get what I'm saying.  Christ has a love that transcends all positions and peoples, which is meant for every person.  And He has entrusted the ability to share that love with us - beauty can be demonstrated in nature, power and majesty in the cosmos, tranquility in stillness, but love can only be demonstrated through the willful interpersonal contact.  How I pray that we may all be able to grasp what His love is like and set our eyes upon Him in a more and more personal way, faithfully letting Him guide our paths and our actions.

						   LOL...I went shopping tonight, and it's amazing what things will make me amused / happy.  At the gocery store, it's being able to find Catawba wine...I had some the last time I went up to Lake Erie and I thought it was great, but I couldn't find it around here.  Lo and behold, the Acme up the street has it...  So then I went to Wal-Mart (forgetting what day of the year it was until I walked in the door, at which point it's too late) because I had to find some presents for the Mortar Board thing on Monday.  For some reason, I just absolutely love Legos (both the real and generic kinds...they're basically all the same)...just sitting there seeing a whole aisle of them, I just wanted to buy a bunch of them and put them together.  I think they should be euphemistically labeled the "clumsy kids' models," because that's really what they are - if you can't do models (either because you ARE clumsy like me, or because you don't have the patience for it (like me), or you don't like making a mess (like me)), then you do Legos.  But maybe it's because you can't "blow up" a model and then put it back together...

						   Can I vent a little?  Yes?  Thanks.  Ok, this whole thing about how much I get paid at work is finally starting to really seap in...it's not enough that I don't get paid enough compared with other people doing the same kind of thing that I am, but I don't get benefits, don't get bonuses, and don't get raises.  Yeah, I'm totally getting screwed, and the whole I-really-need-money-for-Washington thing only makes the bitterness all that much worse.  I was reading about the woman that will probably be taking over my job today...she was making about 2x's more than I am, she got yearly raises, she was in a profit-sharing program, and she got a yearly bonus.  Me = none of the above.  And she was in another relatively small business.  On the one hand, I try not to get angry - I agreed to be paid a certain amount for the work I did, and I always had the option of leaving (theoretically).  But on the other hand I've done a LOT for them - my position wasn't nearly as complicated when I got there, I've done a pretty good job at it, I do everything they ask me to (which is way outside of whatever vague job description I may have), and I basically headed the ISO program we implemented that will probably bring in a lot of money for the company.  So what do I get for ISO?  Dinner.  Anyway...like I said, I'm trying to not get angry about it or anything.  Things will turn out as they should, so there isn't really any point in gettin upset.  But I'm not bein too successful....every time I think I've got a grip on things something comes up that reminds how much I could use the extra money I think I've earned, and the whole emotional range of things starts all over again...

						   I just had to relate this - I was listening to Weissenberg playing Rachmaninoff this morning (as a note, Rach's Prelude in G Minor is definitely my favorite classical piece), and my aunt comes in and asks, "Is that Yanni?"  I hardly restrained myself from rolling my eyes and sayings something disgraceful...of course, that's just barely worse than when I walked in to the kitchen one day and my Grandma was listening to Rush Limbaugh, so I turn to her and ask, "So you're goin conservative, eh?" (I actually had no idea what her political stances were).  In response, she turns to me and, absolutely honestly and with a straight face, says, "Rush is conservative?"  (insert mournful shaking of head...)

						   Thanksgiving is definitely my favorite holiday of the year.  Christmas is too commercialized, Easter is too mysticized, and all the other holidays don't measure up in meaning.  I think that both Christmas and Easter have lost a lot of their focus, too - Christmas is more about Santa than Christ any more, and ditto for Easter and the Easter Bunny (now where did  that  come from?).  But Thanksgiving just seems to have retained the original intent Abe Lincoln had when he created it during the Civil War - it's simply a day when everyone can get together with family and friends and express their gratitude for what they have, whether it be physical gifts or relational bonds.  There isn't the distraction of getting things (like Christmas and Easter), there isn't any big hoopla concerning dressing up or decorating, it's just about the simple things in life and being grateful for them.  Gratefulness and appreciation are things we don't express very often in this society, so a day dedicated to it seems only fitting to help get our focus back on what it should be.  Oh, and there are a few things that have been pissing me off lately.  First and foremost among is people putting up Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving - come on people, it's a freaking month until the holiday actually gets here!  This is just as bad as people putting out "Halloween decorations" (now that is just absurd as far as I'm concerned - pumpkins are ok, but come on...).  And stores putting out Christmas wares WAY before Christmas (I think I saw some with Christmas stuff out at the beginning of November); this kind of stuff just kills whatever "Christmas spirit" may exist and exposes the holiday for what it really is - a vast capitalist conspiracy speaking forcefully with the modern capitalist motto - "greed is good" (ok, so maybe that's a little extreme, but I think you get the point).  Ok, enough ranting...time for me to go get sleepy and watch football.  Oh yeah, and my family is comin over... :P

						   You know, I think I've decided that there is something wrong with me (not that that's a great revelation or anything...).  Maybe it's just natural for all of us, but I have an insatiable need to feel needed, to feel depended upon, to feel appreciated.  I think that this is one of the reasons that I love helping people so much, just for that feeling.  And also one of the reasons that I love playing on sports teams - I love competition, but there is just an element of absolute interdependence inherent in playing on a team that I really feel a need for.  Perhaps my biggest problem is that I don't know how to act when the problem is over.  It seems like I always just end up going back to being a nobody when the pressure's off or when the problem's resolved, and this makes me feel just as unappreciated afterwards as I did appreciated while I was helping.  But I just...I don't know, it just seems like my worldview is so centered around need that I don't know what to do when need is absent, when everything seems fine.  This might sound horrible, but I've honestly thought at times that the best girl for me would be a depressive - not necessarily someone who was manic or anything, but someone who just tended to be more somber.  My (probably skewed) reasoning is that such a person would seemingly have perpetual problems (be it anything from actual "big" problems to just needing cheered up), so I could always feel needed because I could always be helping her.    So maybe this clears up why I'm still single - on the one hand I love helping people, but on the other I know that I am person that needs to be perpetually needed.  Thus, in some strange way me liking a girl probably means that having a relationship with her would be bad for her because I have a need for her to be needy...  Ok, that is just so screwed up I can't even believe I actually feel that way...

						   Grr...sometimes I wonder how I get into these things...I check my credit card balance today and find out I have three months of charges from AOL!!  I mean, I've been on Earthlink since I got cable last year, so this is totally insane...all I can figure is that I was automatically set up with the screen name and all when I bought my Dell.  So now I'm stuck paying for a service I've never used...either that or going through the whole contestation ring-around.  Grr....

						     Comments from a half-day    You know, I should probably start working on my papers for class before the night before, that way I might actually be able to do some editing on them.  As it was, I did the usual go-to-bed-late-and-wake-up-early thing for the paper due today, so I'm tired.  Of course, I've been telling myself the same thing for 6 or 7 years now, so you would think it would have sunken in by now...  Oh, and then it was raining this morning.  I don't know if I have bad tires or if I'm still getting used to the manual, but I swear I spun my tires six or seven times getting to school and then to work.  One time...well, let's just say hydroplaning isn't the right word for it.  Fortunately, it only happened in first (my nemesis!).  I think that Wendy's is starting a new ad campaign or something.  I stopped by to pick up something for lunch, and I swear that every person I talked to said "See you tomorrow."  Now, I hardly ever go there, so it's not like I'm a "regular" or something.  I think I'm not going to go there tomorrow just for that...  Hard to believe that yesterday I was running around in shorts.  Looking outside now...yeah, it's snowing.  Pretty hard, actually...the roof opposite my office is totally covered.  Maybe we'll have a white Thanksgiving? :-P

						   I don't know why, but this song just resounded with me tonight, maybe because it kinda reflects some of my own frustrations...    Swim - "Girlfriend"   "Room 421, an airport hotel, I know I should be sleeping, But it's too soon to tell, If I fly out tomorrow, If I see her tomorrow, I hope that I will...  There's no place like alone, There's no sound like my own, My own voice fading into a quiet December night, But I'm doing all right, I'll make a phone call or two, I've got a wonderful view...  Could I get some room service please? Just send the maid in to see if I'm still alive, At a quarter 'til five, If I'm still right here, Debating a year, Serenading the mirror....  Bring me my girlfriend, And a bottle of wine, Bring me a future, Just make sure it's mine Will you open the window, But leave out the cold? Could I make a phone call to Jesus, To clean up my soul?  Miles from my own bed, Further from content, I guess I should get used to this, Still rain on the runway, But I'm doing ok, I've got cigarettes to kiss.  Could I get some room service, please? I'm down on my knees, I'm only here for a night, 'Cuz they screwed up my flight,  So could you bring me my girlfriend? And a bottle of wine, Bring me a future, And just make sure it's mine Will you open the window, But leave out the cold? Could I make a phone call to Jesus, To clean up my soul?  I'd settle for a Savior soul-keeping, please, Could you put me through to Jesus, I'd pay the long-distance fees, He said, "Hello" and "God bless you, there's a Bible in the drawer..." That's wonderful, sir, But I don't read it any more...  Just bring me my girlfriend, And a bottle of wine, Bring me a future, Just make sure it's mine Will you open the window, But leave out the cold? Could I make a phone call to Jesus, To clean up my soul?

						   OK, time for one of those miscellaneous blogs that I've been thinking about for a while and finally decided to just get down...(so watch out!)  So I was sitting there feeling sorry for myself yesterday because I was feeling lonely (which happens more often than I would like to admit), and I think I've finally realized that all my girl problems (or, more precisely, lack-of-girl problems) are entirely due to my own actions (actually, lack of actions).  I mean, honestly, there are a few girls that I really like, but I never actually say anything; I'm always waiting "until I know them better," or the "timing is right," or "when I mature."    Yeah, these are cop-outs, but I guess I'm more afraid of starting something and not having it work (and all the pain and frustration that that brings with it) than doing nothing about how I feel.  I mean, I've lived with loneliness for most of my life, and it hasn't hurt me too bad; on the other hand, the one experience I've had with heartbreak really messed me up.  So I think the decision-making process is pretty obvious here...don't do anything that might get you hurt.  I'll be the first to admit that this is totally cowardly.  Most anything worth gaining entails risk at some point, and inasmuch as finding the right girl is a goal of the highest worth, so the process of finding her entails the most risk.  Unfortunately, I'm a relatively risk-averse person; thus, when it comes to girls I try to wait for a "sure-thing" (which never comes).  Naturally, the answer is to be a bit more risky ( not  risque ;), but that could take a while.  And I'm a little dull when it comes to reading girls, so someone would virtually have to come up and smack me across the head before I realized that they actually liked me (which is not something I ever assume).  But at the same time, it's obviously something I'm going to have to do eventually, so why not start sooner rather than later?  I don't really know what the point of all this is, but let's just say that I'm getting a little frustrated with myself.  Hopefully someday things will come more naturally for me, especially in social settings; until then, I just hope that I don't miss some great opportunities with some great people because I'm too afraid to tell and show them how I feel.

						   ok, this whole car-thing is getting confusing...so I call my dad after I get done with work, and he says that he thinks it's a good deal! :-P  So now I'm frantically trying to get a hold of the saleswoman I was working with on this, but I can't get through!  Grr...I swear, if I lose this car now... >-|

						   Holy cow...I think I finally figured out why I feel so down every time I listen to my parents (i.e. do what they think is right).  How's this for my messed up fundamentalist background - it's because I know I ought to (b/c they are my parents), but I don't really trust them (I just think they've been wrong too many times before).  So basically, it's a lose-lose situation - listen to them and feel bad because I don't think it's the right decision, or not listen to them and feel bad because I think I  should  listen to them.  I think y'all can see the dilemma here...grrrr......

						    I hate car buying   Well, as if I needed a reminder of why I hate car-buying, I got one today.  Seems that the car I was looking at (an '04 Accent) suddenly increased in price from $6495 to $6995; they claim that the $6495 car has already been sold, and that as this was a special discount price, the next discounted '04 is going for $6995 (nonnegotiable).  I honestly don't know if this is true or not; my dad thinks that they are pulling a "bait-and-switch."  Of course, me being the naive, trusting person that I am...well, I want to believe them, and I honestly still think that it's an ok deal even at $6995.  Unfortunately, I'm trying to keep the total debt for this transaction below $7,000, so $6995 doesn't cut it (adding taxes and everything else brings the total to about $7500).  Grr...and I really liked that car.  Oh well...back to looking at mid-mileage Toyotas and whatnot.  GRRR....looks like I'm back to square one.

						    Fear, in a deeper sense...   I'm scared to death that I'm wrong about my faith, what little I have.  I think I've finally boiled down the equation I'm trying to find the answer to, but I can't rationalize my missing link.  Basically, my equation for whether Christianity is true is "God exists" --> "Jehovah is God" --> "Christ is Jehovah."  Based upon evidence, I accept the first premise via the Creation Complexity and First Mover arguments and the third based upon prophecies.  But the second is where I can't find an answer; how can I be sure that Jehovah is the one true God?  In a society which embraces theological relativism, I have become saturated with the sense that "anything is ok."  I hesitate to say that someone else is wrong because I fear that they may be right (and, likewise, I wrong), a hesitation fundamentally founded upon my fear that Jehovah is not God (or at least, the only one true God).  In relation to this dilemma, I was thinking about how things can be proven today.  The method that we have all been taught in school is empirically, i.e. scientific investigation.  A closely related method is rational process, i.e. that something "makes sense" based upon available evidence and/or formal logical formulas.  I think that most of my theological search thus-far has been heavily reliant upon these two methodogies, especially the rational process.  However, due to the inherent nature of spiritual realities and the whole "faith-thing," this is extraordinarily frustrating for two reasons:  first, spiritual things can't be proven empirically, and second, virtually anything can be "proven" via rational process if you begin with the right premises (just take my word on this).  However, there is another form of "proving" something which better lends itself to the nature of beliefs - relational dynamics.  Boiled down, this basically says that if you believe something you actually live according to what you hold, and if someone you know believes the same thing, you help them live that way, too - the cliche words for this are "being real" and "accountability."  However, as my name for this concept insinuates, the dynamics of this process are relational - you have to be able to see how someone lives their life to see whether they live according to their beliefs, and you have to have some sort of relationship with the person if they are going to help you stick to what you (plural) believe.  The more you see of someone's life, the greater they "prove" their example by their faithfulness to their beliefs; likewise, the more effectively someone helps another live according to a shared belief set, the more the belief set is "proven" by demonstrating a shared commitment to its principles.  While the "formal" methods of proving something taught in schools, the relational process is something that we inherently know simply by being human.  Anyone who participates in debate or rational investigation will tell you that an argument is not invalidated simply because the person who presents it does not live by what they are espousing; perhaps this is true in an abstract sense, but it certainly is not true in the "real world."  The way that one lives is the strongest proof that what one says is true; as St. Francis of Assissi (sp?) once said, "Share the Gospel every day; if necessary, use words."  In this relational sense I feel as though I have a genuine paucity of "evidence."  Right now, the people that I used to look up to as spiritual leaders (especially my parents) have largely abdicated whatever "accountability" function they had with me, and in many cases aren't even necessarily living according to what they espouse.  Quite simply, this has been devastating; hypocrisy breads questions, questions without answers spur doubt, and doubt ferments into denial.  I fear that I am well along this road; I feel like the father in Mark who exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!" Underneath all this doubt is a once-solid foundation which continues to hold, but what once was a stalwart in my life is quickly crumbling  and I feel powerless to stop the deterioration; like the boy at the dike, there are only so many holes you can plug on your own.  Of course, there isn't really anyone else "coming alongside" who I feel I can trust with my doubts, fear, reservations, and questions, no one who can demonstrate to me the "right way."  Honestly, it doesn't even necessarily have to be someone who is more "advanced" than I spiritually or whatnot; as on an athletic team, sometimes growth is  best spurred by individuals who begin from the same place and grow together.  But what is going on now can't continue; a lot of people can tell me what they think is the "right way," but who will show me that they believe what they say, who will stick with me when I take a wrong step and have to work to get back to right?

						   Well, the night has gotten better than the day.  First, I might have already found another car!  Yep...2003 Hyundai Accents are on sale up in Cleveland, so I gotta go up there on Saturday and check them out.  Oh, but I gotta learn how to drive a manual for before then ;)  Second, got a hold of my dad and we have a legitimate explanation for the amounts on my special circumstances form, so maybe I'm back in business there.  Also got some more info over to Christ about the internship and WPNI, so maybe Sen. DeWine will come through with some good 'ol funding (yep, that's right, your tax dollars hard at work - supporting ME!!!).  Had a really interesting discussion with Melissa tonight; it was kinda nice to relate with someone else about some of the spiritual things goin on in my life.  Someday maybe I'll even get enough courage to post some of them on here, but for the time being y'all will have to just have to hold your breaths for a little longer (I promise it isn't anything amazingly deep or anything like that; in fact, quite the opposite).  OK, gotta get goin on my Direct Dem paper...11:30 and just starting a 5-page paper.  YIKES!!

						   In case anyone hasn't noticed, I'm an equal-opportunity IMer, i.e. if you're on, I'll talk to you!  And yes, I'm one of those annoying people who will say hello EVERY day (and maybe even more than once!).  What can I say?  I like to think it's just that I like being nice, like saying howdy and seeing how everyone's day went, but maybe it's a compulsive-obsessive thing.  Who knows?  Anyway...if anyone just gets sick and tired of me IMing them EVERY day, just mention it...I'll try to restrain myself to every other day ;)

						   Well, at least today started out interesting.  They've been doing construction on our road, so what is normally a two-lane road was cut down to two lanes by cones the workers had put up.  So I turn into what had been the west-bound lane yesterday...and there's a Mack dump truck coming right at me (in the opposite direction!).  After hurriedly ducking out of the way into the "dead" lane, I finally figured out which lane was which...  School was ok today; I got back my Political Econ. test, and I was pleasantly surprised with my grade (a B, but I thought it was going to be a C).  Then I had to take a Spanish quiz, and I have no idea how I did (that's the worst feeling...it's so much more comforting when you think you did well or badly).  Anyway...then I ran over to Financial Aid to see if they had my special circumstances form done, and they basically told me not to expect anything (i.e. I'm totally screwed).  Evidently the estimates on the SS form had been low last year, so it doesn't look like I'm probably going to be in the running for anything (of course, the one semester that I NEED it).  Maybe something will come of it, but don't count on it...yeah, nice answer.  So I'm heading out to my car, and I thought I would give the car repair place a call to check in on my car.  Needless to say, not only does it have a blown head gasket, but she said something about a rod in the engine and maybe something in the undercarriage.  Her suggestion was to find a new car; I agree, but I don't really even have enough money for school right now, not to mention car payments.  Sometimes I just wonder what the cosmic plan is at work here.  I mean, I work my butt off, make an honest effort to keep things in order, and it just seems like nothing comes of it.  And I'm sick of people telling me that it will come to something someday; sometimes it just doesn't, some people are seemingly destined to try hard and not reach their goals.  Maybe I'm just one of those people...  Honestly, I would be fine with making less, with simply having a job that I enjoy and quietly passing my days enjoying the simple things of life.  With just helping people out, volunteering with my church and community, enjoying what family I may have.  But that's never good enough (or so everyone seems to say, especially my parents); you have to have more, do more, be more.  Typical American exceptionalism / consumerism / materialism / liberalism / egocentrism...pisses me off...

						   As if today hadn't been crappy enough (not for any particular reason...it just has been), I just called the car repair shop to find out about my car - as I feared, blown head gasket.  $500 to fix.  This is NOT what I needed right now...I don't even know if I'm going to have enough for Washington, and now I'm looking at either an expensive repair on an old car or buying a new one.  Grr...they need to hurry up and get me back my tuition money...

						   You know, sometimes I'm amazed at how selfish / ego-centric of a person I am.  Seriously, I just have a hard time being happy for others sometimes; in fact, sometimes their success and happiness can even make me get depressed!  For instance, if I hear about someone starting to date someone else or getting engaged or something, I usually have one of two responses:  skepticism (i.e. "they won't make it") or envy ("Why couldn't that be me finding someone?").  Of course, I'm so horrible at picking up on those "little clues" that are supposed to tell you whether someone likes you or not that a girl would virtually have to smack me across the face with it (or just tell me) before I would proably figure it out.  Or if I hear about someone having something really great happen to them, it's "why couldn't that happen to me?"  And even though I know it's wrong to be like that, that I should be happy for them and with them, it just seems so hard; joy and happiness just don't seem to be things that come easily to me.  Maybe it's partially due to my inferiority complex; I'm always afraid someone is going to be better than I am, that I just won't be able to measure up.  So everything good that happens to someone else is a threat; I feel like I'm getting left behind, like I'm just not keeping up with the experiences and lives that everyone is having.  Of course, I have to admit that this kind of perspective is horribly joy-crippling.  Not only can I not rejoice with other people when they do well, but I can't even be happy with myself when something good happens to me - it was just something that I had to do to catch up with everyone else, or to keep up with what everyone else is doing.  I have to admit that I've been getting better at this lately (so all of you reading this don't have to worry about if I secretly hated you if you told me about something good that happened to you ;).  But at the same time...dang, sometimes it's just so painful.  I hate that feeling, and I want to be able to be happy with other people and all...but most of the time it just seems like I'm trying to keep an "even keel" so that the bad times don't seem so bad.  Of course, this also means that the good times don't seem so good, too...

						   You know, I think I've decided that this is probably the hardest semester I've had in college.  Maybe not necessarily in terms of how much schoolwork I have to do, but in terms of how much stuff I have going on and how hard it's been to keep up on everything.  I mean, honestly, this is the least # of credits that I've ever taken (15), but three of my five classes are relatively reading-intensive, and I don't know what it is but it just seems like I can't read like I used to.  Maybe I need to have my eyes checked, maybe it's the fact that I'm actually trying to learn what I'm reading (since we don't really go over much of what we read in class) but I'm probably only reading at about 1/3 the pace that I'm used to.  Grr...  Of course, the fact that I'm relatively disinterested in virtually all of my classes doesn't help very much.  I would say that Conflict Management is probably about the only class that I get "up" for (ok, maybe Direct Dem., but that's more due to who's in the class...); all the rest are honestly on things that I couldn't care less about.  And political science reading is boring to begin with, so adding a low level of interest only makes it twice as bad.  It could also be the fact that I think I'm getting lazier, or at least less driven by academic success.  As I near the "end" of my academic "career," I look back and wonder if what I was taught was really what I needed to learn; it seems like I was stuffed full of facts and figures, philosophies and rationalizations, but I was never taught about the more human side of things, the things that  mean  something.  And now I wonder if all that really matters are those things I haven't learned, because what I have learned certainly doesn't seem to have given me any sense of joy or purpose.    So now I sit here and silently plead for a deeper meaning to what I learn, a transcendence between academic knowledge and the personal relationships that give life figure and fullness.  At the very least I want to learn things that I believe to be true, things that help me to be a better man, a better person, a better me.  I want to have my "life questions" answered by someone that I trust, someone who I know is not only smart but wise.    And so I realize that all of this time spent in classrooms really means very little, that I have not learned that which I seek answers to, that what education I have received has left me ill-prepared to address such questions.  For the answers I seek are found in wisdom, not knowledge; in relationship, not academia; in discernment, not perception.  I pray that I might find these answers once I am finished with this tortuous path called "school;" I know that I probably will not even begin to see them before.  For the answers that I seek are not expressed in books or theories, or even in words or reason, but in the life that one lives, in the relational touches that mold and shape our lives with fingers no one sees, in the quiet stillness at the end of the day when one has opportunity to reflect on the simple joys of life that transcend what we do and strike to the very depths of our hearts, there speaking in a language of communion with those we love and our God.  These are the things that I want to learn...

						   Well, I went to see Matrix Revolutions with Jay on Sunday night...I have to admit, I kinda walked out of the last one with some of the same feelings as when I walked out of the first one, i.e. that there was a lot of philosophy / religious symbolism in it and that I would have to watch it a couple of times to unpack everything.  Some people had told me that they didn't really like the ending, but I thought that it made perfect sense since several philosophical threads from different religions ran through the whole series, and the ending was simply the logical conclusion of the movies as a rational outcome of the philosophy that had been building.  Of course, that's probably more analytical analysis of the movie than any of you wanted to hear...  Of course, aside from this it has the typical awesome special effects and all...a couple of times Jay, Ed, and I kinda gave each other that " OH YEAH !" look in anticipation of a sweet fight or something.  And I have to say that I wan't really disappointed in that regard...the last one was a lot like the first two in terms of action, etc., but that's as much as I'm going to say because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't already seen it.  Speaking of movies...watched Finding Nemo with my Grandma and Jay for the third time in a week today.  I don't know what it is, but I absolutely love that movie...it's one of those movies where I can laugh at the same part over and over and over, even if I already know what the part is going to be and there isn't any surprise to anything.  Not to sound all parental, but it's just a good, down-to-earth, wholesome movie that really has a lot of laughs without being risque or anything, and I think that that's one of the primary reasons that it's kinda caught on with people of all ages (including my own oh-so-important demographic...).

						   After a lifetime of painstaking observation and experience, I have decided that I'm just not very good at the whole social-relationship thing.  More specific elements of this (i.e. relationships with girls, etc.) are even worse.  As I often relate about myself, "If you want to see me FREAK OUT, put me in a group of people I don't know and tell me to mingle."  Of course, I'm not all that much better with people I do know...  I still don't know why this is.  Maybe it's the early-childhood homeschooling, maybe the ultra-fundamentalist views I was exposed to early on, maybe it's just the way I am...who knows?  Of course, none of this would change the way things are...and I just am SO conflict-averse.  I swear, I'll be sitting in class and we'll be discussing something, and I can see the whole discussion unfolding in front of me and I get some kind of lock-jaw; it's not just that I won't talk, but I get very tense.  Sometimes I'll walk out of a class exhausted, yet not having said a word and not really even remembering much of what was said.  I think the answer might be to actually going back to having an opinion on things.  Because I'm so conflict-averse I tend to try to create a "educated" view which "balances" the views and facts involved; of course, this runs contrary to my true nature, which tends to create very "principled" / idealistic stances based upon generalized concepts I hold to be true.  As one might imagine, this internal contradiction can be extremely frustrating most of the time.  Ah well...c'est la vie de Mike.  Maybe things will change someday; maybe it will all just fall together and I'll wake up a happy person.  But I doubt it...

						   Today was awesome...went down to hang out with Lisa for the afternoon, and it was really great to see her again!  Things have been pretty maniacal with school lately (especially for her, Ms. Med-School and all :P), so it was really nice to be able to take a little break from it all.  Plus, she's just a really cool person to hang out with... :)  LOL...we ended up going to COSI, and I swear I haven't been to one of them in ages (actually, I didn't even realize that they had them anyplace other than Columbus!).  We both agreed that in our "advanced age" it would be more fun if we had younger kids with us (I just love the amazement on their faces - older kids, including myself, have such a harder time actually being surprised by anything, or at least actually showing it - I have a quote on my background rotation which says, "The world shall perish not for lack of wonders, but for lack of wonder," and I totally think this is true).  But there was some really cool stuff...I especially love anything that kinda makes you question your perceptions of reality, and they had some really cool stuff that did exactly that (in more of a physics-oriented fashion, not necessarilty philosophically :-P).  When I got home I started to work on my internship application for D.C., and I have to admit that I LOVE the way they have structured their essay.  Instead of the dumb "tell us about yourself" type, they give you a facts set and you have to write a defensive position for your "client," including what your investigation would be, who you would question, what evidence you would look for, etc.  Of course, there's a couple ambigious words that I have to write the internship direct about so my essay isn't about 10 pages long (there are a LOT of variables in the scenario they give us), but I definitely love this kind of stuff...  Oh, and when I got back my brother wanted to go see the Matrix: Revolutions, so I checked online to see when it was playing.  Under the title it sayed "ID Required," and that kinda sent up a red-flag for me for taking my brother (he's 16) - we had some problems last time we took him to Reloaded.  Anyway, he called up Cinemark - in one of the dumbest rules I think I've ever heard of, the only way that he could get in (being under 17 and it being a rated "R" movie) would be with our ACTUAL parents.  Never mind the fact that I'm 22 and could take him driving...nope, I could get sued for him crashing a car, but I can't take him into a movie.  Geesh...

						   Yesterday was interesting...  First, I had the ubertest - Political Econ.  I don't know whether I didn't study enough (certainly a possibility), the test was just really hard (certainly true), or I'm just getting dumber (also true), but I don't think I did too well...of course, I thought that about another test last week and did ok, so maybe I'm going through post-exam anxiety.  Nah...I didn't do well :-P  Feeling thoroughly beat-up after the test, I decided that I deserved a break - thus, I blew off Comparative and Spanish.  Instead, I went and got a hair cut (which was NEEDED, but I think it needs to grow out a little more to go with the beard better...), then stopped by home (no one was there), then stopped by church to give blood (they weren't set up yet).  So that was partially productive (but certainly moreso than going to class :)  Anyway, headed back to school and picked up Conflict Management.  I think that if I could do college over again I would love to get a Conflict Management degree...it is just SO useful (I mean, who doesn't have conflicts?).  Anyway...after class go home, mess / lazy around a little, then head over the LifeCenter to work out.  Get done working out and head over to give blood at church (now that it's open!).  Guess what?  I didn't pass the screening!  Evidently my pulse was too high (a good half-hour after I got done working out...), so they wouldn't poke me...  The rest of the night was pretty uneventful, but I did do some cooking :)  Yep...I think I'm getting pretty good at the pre-fab stuff (i.e. stir-fry, rice, cookies, etc.) - it's time to graduate to making stuff from scratch...

						   Just got back from my first WPNI meeting, and I am SO PUMPED!  The program sounds cool and all, and it will be nice to get away from here for a while, but the main reason is because one of the students who did the program last year told about her time with the D.C. Public Defenders Office.  Now THIS is what I want to do...I think I'm also going to apply to the D.C. Prosecution office, but either of the two sound good.  Her internship sounded awesome - VERY hands-on, getting right "into the action" and actually interacting with people (while practicing law...from what she told me, it's kind of a cross between an investigator and a paralegal).  Maybe it's just the thought that I might get shot (a lot of the work is in the ghettos, etc. - she worked on a murder case last year), but I think it's mostly the concept that this is EXACTLY what I want to do (i.e. help people who can't help themselves and/or work in the public interest).  At least, I think so, and that's why this is so perfect...I can find out if prosecution or public defender is what I want to do, whether I can put up with the ethical dilemmas and situations that doing so would entail (and also finding out what is fact and what is myth).  The WPNI group seems really good, too.  I actually knew quite a number of the people from some of my other classes, but it just seems like everyone is going to get along pretty well (there was even a guy who wanted to work with the RNC!).  Anyway...I need to go study for my Political Econ test, but this was just so awesome, I had to get it down...:D

						   I don't know what it is, maybe the fact that I'm almost done with college and the law-school path seems pretty set right now, but a lot of the anxiety I had earlier this fall about what I wanted to do seems to be dissipating.  Indeed, I'm actually getting excited about the opportunities I think I might have in law...maybe that's only because I haven't actually started law school yet and gotten worn down by the system, but I think this might have more to do with the fact that I'm letting myself get excited about it.  I just started to realize this a couple of weeks ago, how I didn't get excited about things in the future very much because I didn't let myself do so.  It probably goes back to how I get my hopes really high when I expect something and tended to have crushing disappointments when I was a kid (and some even after I got older), so I think that recently (i.e. the past several years) I've just decided to not get too involved with anything.  But I don't think this is the right way to go about things; to not get myself involved is to rob myself of the strongest motivation behind doing something.  To hope is to risk disappointment - to go through life being risk-averse so that one doesn't have to hope in anything robs one of the greatest joys that life has to offer.  One might think that it would also prevent someone from experiencing life's greatest pains, but I don't think this is true - in an odd way joy and pain are two sides of the same coin, and sometimes experiencing the one is the only way that we can appreciate the other.  To experience neither doesn't make one's life more happy, but simply blase, boring, tepid.  Of course, despite all this talk about hope and all actually doing so is still a struggle for me.  Hope/faith is like a muscle - it gets stronger with use, but disuse leads to entropy, and it can take a while to get it back in shape.  In the meantime I keep trying to find "safe bets" on things that I can hope for, but I know that eventually I'm going to have to risk a little more, put more of myself on the line.  I just pray to God that He is in the details, and that it all turns out for the best...   Bebo Norman - I'm Alright  I've got a little hope in my pocket, I want to share a bit with you Just be careful that you don't drop it, but don't worry if you do 'Cause I got broken down inside me, and I might just need some help But I will get by  And I've got demons in my history, got bone beneath my skin But I've been taken by a mystery, yes, I've been taken in And sometimes voices down inside me try to fight me for myself I will get by  What have I got to live for If there's nothing beating in my chest What have I got to live for When this world starts turning, it's burning me up I'm alright  I used to think love was just a barter, second hand coincidence What doesn't kill you just makes you harder, so I used my common sense Keeping cold to keep my distance, ‘til you took my pride away Now I will get by  I am not afraid, no, I am not afraid And I will not go crazy here  I've got a little hope here in my pocket, I want to share a bit with you So just be careful that you don't drop it, but don't worry if you do 'Cause I got voices down inside me, and I might just need some help I will get by  What have I got to live for If there's nothing beating in my chest What have I got to live for When this world starts turning, burning me up When my heart is hurting, I'm learning the rough When this world starts turning, it's burning me up I'm alright

						   The Morter Board meeting tonight was, um, interesting.  It all started off normal enough...we went over the Christmas thing we're having for the kids from the community centers in our area and our other projects.  But then it suddenly turned into an impeachment hearing - seriously, one woman in our group said how she didn't think the president of MB was pulling his weight (which probably is true), and suddenly we're in deliberations about how we're going to approach him about this.  It was crazy, especially since the Secretary (who is the one really running things right now) was asked to leave the room when we started talking about it, but came back in before the discussion was over.  I think the whole thing did a pretty heavy number on her (poor girl) - I don't think she necessarily wants to be Prez, and I also think that a lot of us (me included) were pretty worried about the way that the concern had been raised with the group before it had been raised with Brad (the Prez).  ANYWAY...so that was the interesting part of my night.  Aside from that, today was pretty normal EXCEPT that it was ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL outside!!!  Just one of those days that you wish it were like that every day...but alas, c'est la vie.  Oh, and as a totally miscellaneous side note, I saw an awesome car yesterday - it was a yellow Viper with purple ground lighting.  While I might have preferred blue or black with the purple ground lighting (or better yet, silver with blue ground lighting), it was still pretty cool ;)

						   OK, time to add two more things to the things that annoy me...  1.  The packing tape we use at work...somehow they've managed to make it smell like ammonia mixed with dirty gym socks...(ugh)  2.  Cold-call salespeople, especially pretty girls.  I'm usually decent at getting rid of the guys (especially the one selling useless toys and whatnot), but somehow the office-supply companies and freight carriers have a knack for getting pretty girls to be their salespeople.  Maybe it's a personal failing, but I just can't tell them to scram...one of them suckered me for over $100 worth of office supplies just by smiling and pointing at things we might need (in my own defense, we did need SOME of them...) :-D

						   Oh wow...a lot of miscellaneous things to talk about today...  I found another thing that annoys me today:  women's soap in a men's bathroom (or any bathroom, for that matter).  I mean, I walked into the men's bathroom here at work today and we had "fresh peach"-smelling soap.  Now what guy wants to walk around smelling like "fresh peach?"  C'mon...that's almost as bad as when we only had vanilla-scented shampoo at home (and that was the better of my two options - the other shampoo was frescia :-P).  Give me some Lava soap or something - you know, the kind that just about takes your skin off (especially when I need to wash my hands after checking my oil...).  Saturday was definitely the best day of my weekend.  Mortar Board was helping build a gym-set for a community center in Ravenna, so we headed down there about 9:15.  There were actually a lot of people there to help (about 15 or so, not including our group of about 12), and the guy who was in charge of the build (from the gym-set company) had a Bobcat with an auger (a necessity for this kind of project...I bet he dug 15-20 holes 2 ft. in diameter by 3 feet deep - not something I would have wanted to do by hand!).  Our group was first given the task of putting together the "Power Tower" (or something to that effect) - you know, one of those contraptions with the center pole and the rings around the outside that you can climb.  That took about 2 hours or so - the fun part for me was being able to climb about 12 feet up on this ladder (on uneven ground) to put in the bolts at the top, and finding out after I was done that the ladder was structurally unsound! :-D  Then I got to start doing the stuff that I love to do - straight-up manual labor, i.e. haulin mulch, mixing concrete, pullin boulders out of the ground, etc.  I had almost forgotten how much I love to do that kinds of stuff, especially when it's for a good cause - I swear that if I could do that for a living, I would.  Everyone else in my group left at about 12:30, but I stuck around until 3:30 (in yet another episode of my social alienation, no one had wanted to drive down in my car with me...which was fine with me :-P).  There was a group from Computer Associates there, so I pretty much helped them put together the main set.  It had been pretty warm out all day (although it got a little colder as the day went on), and the mist / rain that had been falling all morning had made things pretty muddy.  I loved it!  Needless to say, if there was anything that we needed to do where someone had to get down in the mud (which actually happened quite a lot), I was the guy...by the end of the day I was so caked in mud and concrete that I was just hoping it didn't mix with the water and dry on my clothes or in my hair :-P  Anyway...when I got home I called up my folks and arranged to go to Hudson's football game.  They were playing in the first round of the playoffs against North Canton, so since Danny is on the team I wanted to go and support them (plus, NC was supposed to be pretty good, so maybe he would get in if Hudson got way behind).  Of course, as usual we were a little late getting out the door; the game started at 7:00 in North Canton, and we were leaving Silver Lake at 6:30 :-P  But at least I got to listent othe end of the OSU game...I just don't know how they manage to make EVERY GAME so close and still win!  So after the OSU game my dad turns to the Hudson game on the radio (of course, the only station we could find with it on had to have the worst North Canton announcers on it...but at least we got to hear Hudson fall behind 21-0 in the first quarter :-P).  So then we get down to North Canton and my mom turns to my dad and says, "Are you going to tell me where to go?" - of course, having not said anything before we (meaning everyone else in the car) had assumed that she knew roughly where she was going!  In the end we ended up getting to the game by about the middle of the 2nd quarter (by which point it was 28-0), getting into the game, and promptly watching just about nothing happen on the field.  The game pretty much went downhill from there; the final score was 49-0 North Canton, and Danny didn't get in.  But I think I might have gotten on TV! (at least the camera was pointed right at me...I swear I probably looked so somber, it was a frustrating game).    Anyway...Sunday was interesting.  Went to church - we had our new Transitions Sunday School class, which was cool, but I didn't know half of the people there!  LOL...Dave (the teacher) asked everyone to try to be consistent about coming, but I already know I won't be there at least 1/2 of the time (between video and parking and nursery).  Ah well...c'est la vie.  Came home from church all rarin' to go with my schoolwork...and promptly got sidetracked.  Four hours later, still hadn't started...and THEN I find out that we have virtually the entire family comin over :-P  Of course, being the relatively anitsocial person that I am, that didn't bother me too much (I still read my "Politics and the American Economy" while everyone was there), but it still would have been nice to have some forewarning! :)

						   I had a traumatic an experience on Sunday - I went clothes shipping with EB (my sister).  I never knew that it was such an involved process - of course, this is coming from someone who buys most of their clothes at Wal-Mart.  But come on - trying on 15 suits to find one that fits is a LITTLE much for me.  Of course, I am eternally grateful to her for it because I had to have one and the one I got actually fits, but still...I'm just not happy with the whole shopping experience.  And the way that she treated the clothes!  Oh man...she shoves me in a changing room and demands that I try on one of the dress shirts in the plastic wrickle-proof bags from the row with "Do not try these shirts on" emblazoned across the aisle.  Call me old fashioned, but if it says that I ain't trying it on (besides the fact that I hate putting those kinds of shirts on anyway) :P  And forget about shopping for jeans or pants with her...it would drive me crazy.  Oh how I long for my wonderful Wal-Mart - at least we didn't go to any malls, I swear I would have gone out of my mind!  Anyway...I think I want to become a workaholic.  Seriously - we've got an ISO audit coming up and I was at work until 7:00 on Monday and 9:00 last night (and I'm still her @ 2:45 today when everyone was free to leave @ 1:00) and I'm actually ENJOYING it.  And the audit is still two weeks away!  But working is better than sitting at home doing nothing (which is what I usually do at home), and besides, I'm getting paid for it.  And I just think that I like to work (which is a scary thought, even to myself) - nearly all of the happiest memories in my mind are somehow related to when I was working on something (the paper route in St. Marys, sports teams, yearbook, school projects, missions trips, etc.).  And likewise the worst memories are from times when I was aimless and not really doing anything, when I had too much "free time."  While I don't really look forward to working 80 hours or a week or anything, 60 ain't so bad now is it?

						   Ah, the wonders of being able to sleep in (it was only until 10 today, I swear!).  Of course, after the last couple of days I probably needed to sleep in ;)  Speaking of which, went to the Cavs game last night...of course, Jay and I were a little late in picking everyone up because we had to try to beat Gollum on LOTR-ROTK (for PS2).  Anyway, we get to the meeting place and we end up with 11 people (I only really planned on 6 or 7), so we ended up having to squeeze 3 people (and I mean SQUEEZE) into my car (fortunately the person in the back was Danny, my brother, so I didn't feel too bad for him :P).  So anyway...we left a little late so I had to drive kinda fast, but Jay kept up (he was in Andy's van, which was about bottomed out because it had 8 people in it).  Unfortunately we got separated getting off the highway, so we ended up parking at different places (I paid $5, he paid $15 :P).  So Dan, Danielle, and I get to the ticket counter first and find out that the $10 tickets we planned on buying are sold out - big problem inasmuch as some of us don't exactly have a lot of extra money right now!  So we wait for everyone, powwow outside the Gund, and finally decide to pay the extra 10 bucks and go to the game (some of the folks with us were under 18, so that kinda killed the option of goin out to a lot of the places in Cleveland we were thinking of).  So we run in to buy the tickets and find out that we have to buy them all at once (i.e. on one card, etc.) or else we probably won't get seats together.  Needless to say, $220 later on my debit card we're all sitting together (and I have a wallet-full of cash, something I was a little uncomfortable with).  So we finally get in line to get in (which entails going back OUTSIDE) and wait around for about 20 minutes or so.  They do security checks on everyone, although I could think of a million simple ways to get stuff by them if I had to (I just do stuff like that...it doesn't make me a terrorist!).  So guess who gets busted as a "security threat?"  Yep, yours truly.  The police officer wasn't too amused with the Swiss Army knife I keep on my keychain, so I had to "dispose" of it (I believe his exact words were "throw it away - and not in here").  Being the cheapskate that I am and it being a perfectly good Swiss Army knife, I couldn't bring myself to throw it away just so I could go to a basketball game.  Halfway to the trash can I notice the huge planters they have outside the Gund, so I just bury the "knife" along the side of one of them...fortunately, when I came back out after the game it was still there.  The game was ok - the Cavs were a little flat, it was the second day of the back-to-back.  But at least it was close throught virtually the entire game.  Katie kept telling us what it looked like from up close (she had been to a game earlier in the week where she was 4 rows behind the bench), but I was glad to be sitting next to her because then I got all the running basketball commentary (Her:  "Outlet to the side!....push to the post!...YOU IDIOT!!  HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?!"  Me:  "What'd he do?"  Her:  "Um...just a sec...WHAT?!  Did you see that?  The guy drove the post and didn't even see the guy WIDE OPEN on the wing..." (sad shaking of head). Needless to say, I never got my explanation :P).  Oh, and remember our $5 parking space?  One extra bonus was that we got in and out of it REAL quick (basically get in the car and drive out).  Remember Jay's $15 space?  We were halfway home on 480 when he calls me hysterically exclaiming "We've moved!  Five whole feet!"  Yeah...we were home about 45 minutes before them. :)  But of course this being break and having a bunch of people with us, we couldn't just settle for doin the game.  Nope, I have to invite everyone over for pizza and a movie (of course, I was probably gonna watch the movie on my own anyway, so why not have some people over?).  A half hour and two Papa Johns pizzas later, everyone's here and Bad Boys 2 is in the DVD player (by now it's about 11:00 or so).  Bad Boys 2 is definitely one of my new favorite movies just because it's one of those movies that doesn't really ever stop and you don't really have to think about anything...basically it goes from things getting shot and blown up to comedic interludes to things getting shot and blown up again. :)  Kinda reminds me of Gone in 60 Seconds without the sweet cars or a bleach-blond Angelina Jolie.  Some observations from last night: - Your gear ratios really DO change when you load down your car...and with the engine my car has, it doesn't take much to load it down :P - It's so weird to see people in high school dating.  Not that it's a whole lot different than people in college, but still...maybe I'm just getting hung up on the age.  Or maybe I'm just jealous...:P - I miss my CD-played in my car...I need to switch it out ASAP.

						   I think I finally found what I'm looking for, or at least pinpointed the goal I'm trying to reach.  Our pastor talked about yearning for an "indestructible well-bring of soul" in his message last night, and I think that this is exactly what I've been trying to find.  He used this phrase as a definition of joy, but I think it has so many more meanings to it - joy, contentment, belonging, righteousness, and so many other qualities are wrapped up in the concept of "well-being."  I think that I had this at one time, but I know I don't have it now - my soul feels fragile like an egg-shell, cowering in the corner from all the beatings and bruises its taken (i.e. disappointments, etc.).  All I'm looking for, hoping for, praying for is someone who would actually come alongside me and help me, challenge me, prod me towards the path I need to be on - but of course, this has been a hope for several years now, and I've pretty much given up all hope of it actually happening.  Sometimes I just want to scream during church or when I'm with my Christian friends or something, ask what it is about me that makes people so indifferent about my spiritual well-being.  Is it that I'm too passive?  Seemingly too good (well, I could clear up that misconception real quick...)?  Don't seem to have any problems?  Too "weird," too caught up in the metaphysical aspects of things?  Not committed enough?  Whatever the reason, I just wish that someone would actually care...but I'm not holding my breath.

						   I think that one of the reasons I'm so unhappy sometimes (most of the time) is because I have so much unexpressed joy and anguish.  I think that stifling joy kills it, and repressing anguish leads to melancholy, and I think that one can only really appreciate these feelings by sharing them with others.  I mean, I don't have anyone to express my pure emotions with - it just seems like there isn't anyone who I'm close enough to (or who wants to be close enough to me) that I can actually go and tell them how I feel.  Albeit, for the most part this would probably mean expressing my seemingly perpetual doubts and fears, but every once in a while I have something happen where it just seems so wrong to have no one to share it with, to have no one who will be just as happy about my joy as I am.  And I think that these times when I am at my lowest or at my highest are when my deepest injuries are inflicted - not in the normal sense where someone inflicts them upon you, but in the simple absence of anyone else to share the experience with, someone to validate the experience as real.  I think that it is these times which have inflicted my pervasive sense of loneliness, a sense only punctuated by brief periods of belonging which come along ever-so-infrequentl

						   You know, it's amazing...my weeks are busy, and then you get to the weekend and think it's going to be great, restful, and all...and it's just as busy as the week was.  Ah well...at least it isn't doin the same stuff as during the week.  As you probably can guess, this weekend was one of those busy ones.  Not that I minded - it was also a fun weekend.  Saturday was nice b/c I got to wake up and snow-blow the driveway, which I just kinda like to do.  But I found another pet peeve of mine while I was doing it - people who don't dig grass out of the cracks in their concrete sidewalks.  I swear, I was blowing the sidewalk (you know, to be nice) and I got past our property line and every other sidewalk crack had grass growing so high out of it that it just totally messed everything up (literally - you don't understand how horrible it looks to had sod laying on top of perfectly white snow...it ain't pretty :P).  Not to mention about throwing me over the top of the snowblower...  Anyway...so after that I pretty much didn't have anything goin on until I was working the Saturday night service at church.  I watched the Mount Union championship game (and, I have to admit I was sorely disappointed to see them lose).  Then...man, I don't remember what I did - obviously nothing important :P  So anyway...went to work the service and found out that a guy I played football with in high school got married at our church that day - a bunch of people I kinda knew were walking out of the reception and all.  I don't know whether it was that or being at church or just being worn down from the week, but I was in a pretty bad depression pretty much throughout the service and the evening - you know, gettin those thoughts about how much of a loser I am and all, how I'm fundamentally unhappy, etc.  Thank God that periods like often don't survive a good nights rest.  This morning was a lot better - in fact, I would say that I was downright happy.  Worked all three services - saw Matt Mead and Mr. Myers at church today.  Matt is in grad school @ Notre Dame for accounting, Myers is still teaching at CVCA - basically we just reminisced about CVCA and went over the changes goin on there (we pretty much all agreed that finally getting rid of Haslett was great :P).  Got home and watched the Browns game - all I have to say about the Browns is "GGGRRRRR" (insert exasperated grimace).  Well, at least the Cavs are fun to watch now :)  Went and caught Return of the King tonight...I won't ruin it for anyone, but I think that it's probably the best of the three movies (which is saying a lot).  There were so many parts were Ed, Jeff, or I let out one of those "Oh yeah!" comments...it was just a sweet movie, y'know?  And I love the more metaphysical aspects of it - it's not all just things mindlessly blowing up and all.  I was gonna get together with Lisa tonight, but that fell through when brilliant boy (yours truly) had the wrong number for her house in his cell phone.  Ah well...I guess all you can do sometimes is laugh at yourself and make lemonade (how cliche is that?).  So now it's now, and I'm gonna head to bed so I can get up for another exciting day at work tomorrow.  I have to admit, things are really starting to drag there now...I definitely need to go in tomorrow with my mind made up to FIND productive things to do or I'm going to end up basically wasting a day that I NEED to do productive things with...

						   Well, this LONG week is finally over...I hope that the weekend is at least a LITTLE better (i.e. more eventful).  I have to admit, I'm kinda lost at work...Lani is pretty much taking over all of the daily tasks, etc., so I'm pretty much just a consultant - I feel like I spend most of my time looking for things to do.  Oh well...I suppose that there are worse things that I could be doin.  Speaking of things to do...I suppose that I should start finishing some law school applications.  I've honestly been getting SO MUCH mail from law schools recently - for some reason I think I've gotten something from virtually every school in the state of California.  Anyway...I guess I should start knocking some of these bad boys off so I can get some acceptances back, eh? ;)  OK, time to go get Pirates of the Caribbean from Jay so my little bros can watch it over here...if anyone is interested in catchin a movie over break, we got a kickin' surround-sound system recently :D

						   I did something last night I don't think I've ever done before...at least, not that I remember.  Now before any of you start getting any prurient ides, it was totally benign - I slept for 12 hours straight.  I wasn't feeling so well when I got home, so I went to bed at about 7:00...needless to say, I didn't wake up until 7:30 this morning.  Maybe I'm a little under the weather, and maybe it was kinda make-up for all the stress I didn't realize I had from finals (seriously - I don't think I stressed about finals hardly at all).  Whatever the reason...I felt much better this morning :)  Oh, and more good news for me :)  I got some more money from KSU today (in loans, not free :P), so I might actually be able to go to Washington and EAT while I'm there (although it would probably be better for me if I didn't while I was there...).  And I got all my grades back; I won't gloat (as much as I may want to considering that this semester seemed like the semester from HELL at times), but let's just say my GPA rhymes with "tour." :D  But aside from all that...well, sometimes I wonder why I complain so much.  Maybe because it's nice to just vent, maybe because I feel like people will actually pay attention to me if I make my needs known, maybe because I'm just downright unhappy (and YES, I KNOW THERE ARE STARVING KIDS IN ETHEOPIA, SO I SHOULDN'T BE...if anyone actually believes that, please get over it - there's more than one way to starve).  I'm getting kind of tired of always putting on a "happy face" - it's weird, I actually am happy (usually) when I'm around other people (maybe for that very reason), but when I'm alone I'm usually unhappy (probably because I'm horribly self-critical).  So guess which one I am most of the time?  As always I think it all boils down to my the state of my spirit.  I remember back when I was a kid of 12 or 13, those just seemed like the "good old days"...and it was totally weird, you wouldn't have thought so.  Things were kinda rough at home, I didn't have many friends, I wasn't very active in many things (man, some things just never change)...but there was a sense I had about myself, a contentedness, a tranquility where I knew that whatever happened I was ok, and that gave me a drive to do better, to be better.  All of that is gone now - everything is about  having  to be better, about  having  to do better, about having more, about knowing more - my spirit seems trampled on, underappreciated.  It's stagnating, whithering away, corrupting - I feel like I need to talk to someone who can point me in the right direction, someone who can help me get back to "good."  Because I know until that sense is in my spirit again, whatever else I do won't make me happy in any lasting sense, won't fill the "God-shaped void" yearning open in my soul...

						   Interesting day...woke up and found out that we had 3 inches of snow overnight, so had to snow-blow the driveway.  Then I had parking at church, and it was INTERESTING...people were sliding all over the place, and some knuckleheads just didn't get it through their heads that you SLOW DOWN when it's snowy and slippery like that out.  But it was still fun...I love doing it on those inclement days.  And I get to wave at everyone...maybe it's just a small-town thing, but that's one thing I miss - in St. Marys everyone waved at everyone (you know, just to say "hi"), even if you didn't know the person.  Around here, people don't even wave at people they know...  Sometimes I wonder why I go to church...I'm probably one of the few people who consistently feels WORSE leaving church than they do when they get there.  Sometimes I feel so bad from service I just up and skip Sunday School.  Now I'm not talking about feeling physically ill, but more like I think about things and get too introspective...for some reason church just seems like an easy place to do so.  Anyway...at least I finally think I figured out why I'm unable to get into any relationships during Sunday School today (but I'm not ready to post it on here yet :().  Other than that...came home and basically bummed around until I had to go back to church at 4:00.  I had nursery for the Christmas concert tonight, so I get there and THEN I find out that I have the toddlers (you know, the Terrible Twos)...and to make matters worse, I walk in and there's immediately two kids crying (and I'm the ONLY ONE in there).  So anyway...eventually it gets to about 5-on-1 and someone has mercy and comes in to help me.  My MOM was supposed to be there, but she was running late; of course, I was getting a LITTLE concerned about her coming at all.  Anyway...eventually everything gets shaked out, so we can just worry about the kids - and man, we sure had to worry about the kids.  I won't get into all the sordid (and I do mean sordid) details, but suffice to say we had our hands full.  But it was still fun (in hindsight ;).  So I come home...what can I say about the Browns?  Heartbreakers...it's definitely a love-hate relationship I have with them.  HOW CAN YOU GIVE UP A 30-YARD COMPLETION WITH LESS THAN A MINUTE LEFT IN THE GAME?!  OK, now that I've vented...it was a good game guys, you weren't supposed to do that well against Denver (who am I kidding?...YOU SCREWED UP - AGAIN!).  With that happy thoughts, I think I'm going to go to bed before 10 PM for the first time in months, maybe years...g'night. :)

						   Took a break from work and ran down to get the plates for my car...would you believe it cost me $71 for registration and plates?!  Geesh...this ain't California, so that's a little high, don't you think?  Oh, and then I just about hit a poor kid taking his driving test on the way out.  I swear he probably pissed his pants, I was headed right at him.  Of course, that's what happens when you come to a stop sign, stop, and then  don't go    In his defense I think he was looking both ways - a couple of times - before he went, but geesh, he's gonna have to learn the REAL road rules soon, and one of them is that if you don't go when you come to a stop, the the other person - ME - will go!  Anyway, so I'm halfway through the intersection and THEN he decides he's going to go.  Geesh...if his instructor passed him, I hope that I'm not on the same road as that kid anytime soon...:P

						   Speaking of mood swings...may I gloat for a moment?  Just checked my grades...got a freakin A in Political Econ!  Considering that most of the people I talked to were downright AFRAID of the class and teacher (besides the fact they got C's and D's), I'm pretty happy :D :D :D  Oh, and speaking of happy things...I got accepted for the Public Defender's internship in D.C.  Got the "letter" (via e-mail) last night, gonna send back the reply today.  Now I just have to start working on my ebonics... :P  OK, back to work...

						   I was talking with Eric last night about mood swings (sorry girls, you aren't the only ones who have them), and this is an area of life I don't know why God introduced it.  I mean, would it be so bad to simply have a basic mood and then have minor fluctuations?  But no...like today, I want to just write a rant about how pissed off I am at the world, at God, at everything, even though I know that I have absolutely no reason to do so (thus, why I am not ;), whereas yesterday (or whenever that day was) I was content to relate "happier" things / events.  Maybe it has something to being at work at 9:30 on Saturday morning...or then maybe it's because I'm basically uphappy and don't know what will make me more joyful...or then maybe it's the crazy week I had finally catching up with me (sleep deprivation?  what's that?).  Anyway, I suppose (crack!) I should get (crack!) to work (crack! ouch!).

						   You know, it's funny...I'm pretty much finished with college now (my last final was yesterday! :-D), but I don't have any sense of relief or finality.  Maybe it has something to do with turning around the next day (today) and working a 10-hour day, and then coming in on Saturday.  Hmm....nah...

						    Tidbits   Another one of my pet peeves - I went out and bought one of those key-chain flashlights (the 3-inchers) the other day.  It didn't work when I first opened it, but I thought that was probably on account of the derelict battery it came with (this was  beyond  a generic type).  So I go out and get new batteries - and it still doesn't work.  Of course, I've lost the receipt, so now I'm stuck with a flashlight that doesn't work and I can't take it back...grr....looks like another piece of junk sitting around my room.  Oh, and since I'm throwing up miscellany, there's two guys outside my window having a pretty good argument right now...looks like one of them hit the other guy's SUV with his rental truck...yeah, they're definitely goin at it - I can hear it through my window (which is pretty thick)...oh, there's the cops (this is kind of a running account) - looks like things are gonna settle down a little...yep, things are pretty well under control now (darn), looks like I gotta go back to getting some work done...  Oh, speaking of work...we're getting new computers! :-D  This is an exciting thing for me (despite that fact that I won't hardly get to use them)...the one I'm using now is pretty old, so it's gonna be nice to have one of those cool new ones (especially since it has one of those flat-screen monitors).

						   I just had the strangest thought...if I get this internship in Washington with the public defender's office I could get put into some really awkward situations.  What if one of the places I have to investigate is a strip club or something like that? (for anyone wondering, NO, I'm NOT hoping that that happens :P).  I mean, I still get a little nervous walking into a bar...what am I getting myself into?  Oh well...suppose it's time to start doin what I think is right and let things take care of themself.  Worst case scenario, I'm makin lemonade...

						   I've come to the conclusion that I'm living an artificial life...I'm not a business-like, incredibly self-disciplined person like I'm trying to be, so why force it?  I mean, come on, I love the X-Games and alternative music...I think that on the inside I'm really one of those crazy idiots who does stuff just because it seems like a cool thing to do, who lives by the seat of their pants, pushing the envelope (to use one of my favorite aeronautical phrases).  Of course, this is absolutely the opposite of how I actually live, and I think that one reason that I seem so dead to myself is because every time I pass on an opportunity to follow the path that seems right to me a little part of myself dies, a little bit of that passion which drives the human soul wanes.  It seems like I've been forced into living a life based upon rationality and I've never really been able to express the emotional side of myself, but I'm finally realizing that life is so much more than what makes sense.  I was thinking about things last night...I'm living the freest part of my life, the time when I should be able to do the most things simply because I think that they're right and good, and all I'm doing is pining for, worrying about, and preparing for when I'm not as free.  How sad is that?  So who's to blame for this sad state of affairs?  Me.  I could whine about why everyone else is to blame, try to rationalize how I've gotten to this point, etc., but it wouldn't get me anywhere; fact of the matter is that I simply have to come to the point where I couldn't care less what other people think and just go with what I think is right.  Of course, that also means getting in touch with that part of myself that determines what I think is right ("Conscience?  Are you my conscience?" sorry...a Finding Nemo moment :P).  And it also means I have to come to grips with thinking / believing something WITHOUT having a predetermined and fixed argument for why I think it's right...  Maybe this is why I have such a hard time with faith and trust - on the one hand I'm so rational (both because of upbringing and personal choice) and on the other I'm incredibly postmodern (i.e. I question everything).  Of course, faith and trust are things difficult to rationalize; both entail a certain lack of control, a venturing into the unknown (and thus, an inability to fully rationalize the outcome).  Heck, a lot of the time faith looks like utter foolishness...but hey, that means it should be easier for me since I want to live like a "fool" now anyway, wouldn't you say?

						   Oh man...looks like it's been a little while since I updated this.  Dang...well, instead of trying to narrate everything that's been goin on, here's a nice list :P  -  Installed a surround-sound system at my Grandma's (ok, so maybe it was actually Jay's) - did a very nice job, you can hardly see the wires going all over the place. For anyone in the area - movie night Friday? :) -  Finals week = three all-nighters in four nights.  I forgot how much this time of the year can mess up your sleep schedule; at least I have time to take naps in the afternoons.  Of course, the hard part has been the papers I've had to do - my Political Econ paper was a really butt-kicker, I had to pull TWO all nighters to finish it up (and it was only five pages long!  I just couldn't find a good perspective on it - I worked all night on it and then decided I didn't have anything worth turning in, so I worked another all-nighter on it the next day).  Fortunately my actual exams haven't been that bad, but I'm saying this before I take the Intro. to Conflict Management exam tomorrow... -  Money!  Got a $500 scholarship from WPNI and a $600 Pell Grant (allegedly - I haven't seen anything in writing yet).  I should be getting back my financial information from Kent really soon (like next week).  And a lot of people have been saying that they would be willing to help me out with certain things to get ready (one aunt has promised to help me get a suit - not that I particularly want to get one, but it's required :P).  I might yet be able to pull this off... -  Internship = finally finished up my essay (a case study - it was actually pretty hard) and sent it in.  Had my interview today (via phone); it was pretty tough, Chris (the internship coordinator) asked a couple of really hard questions (ex:  "You've been assigned to defend a man accused of sexually molesting a child.  You walk in to interview him and he blurts out that he did it.  Inasmuch as you still are required to defend him to the best of your abilities, could you continue to work on the case knowing this?"  or "You've been assigned to defend a man accused of killing his roommate.  The police have finished cataloging the crime scene and you go to investigate.  In the course of your investigation you pull back a curtain and find a knife with what looks like blood on it.  What do you do?"  You get the gist of the questions...).  Chris said he would get back to me by sometime next week, so with any luck I'll be all set up for my internship by this time next week :-D -  Washington = found out who my roommates will be and I'm pretty happy with the arrangement.  I've had classes with two of them (there's four of us in a suite) and they're  good guys; the other guy I've had a chance to talk with a couple of times and he seems like a good guy, too (plus, he's originally from inner-city D.C., so I might need to "buddy up" with him ;) -  Work = finally got to meet the woman who will be taking over for me.  Leilani seems really nice; from her resume and talking with her she seems very competent, but it could be a hectic couple of weeks inasmuch as we're only going to have about 3 weeks to get her up to speed and settled in before I'm gone.  And then there's the whole ISO thing comin up...we're finishing up our internal audit this week, and then we're going to have our Management Review on Saturday...looks like I'm probably gonna be working 50-60 hour weeks over "break" between getting Leilani ready and getting ready for the ISO audit on Jan. 13. -  Social = like I have a social life ;).  Although I was thinking about it...this is probably totally weird, but it struck me how much I miss saying "I'm sorry."  Seriously, I probably haven't had a situation where I could (or should) say it in a couple of months (I'm discounting perfunctory situations like accidentally bumping into someone, etc.); of course, I probably say this because I miss having relationships strong enough to allow me to put myself into a situation where the opportunity to say so exists, not because I miss the actual mecahnics of it.  Plus, there's just something restorative and definitive about responding to "I'm sorry" situations - the strength of a relationship is usually better described in how it responds to injury than in how it acts in health.  Of course, "healthy" and "relationships" are not usually words put into the same sentence with me - come to think of it, "relationships" isn't a word usually used in discussing me period. -  Girls = like I have a social life :P.  Nada, zippo, nil; get the point?  Ok, so maybe I have some "ideas," but I'm not planning on starting anything in the next month before I leave for Washington (Lisa, your suggestions was duly noted and is still being pondered ;).  If anyone has any ideas or references, feel free to contact me. -  Birthday = Yes, I am now even older than I was before (not that that wasn't the case yesterday or the day before that...but you know what I mean).  My rewards for turning 23?  Finally being able to file independently for FAFSA (not that it could re-file apply for next semester anyway) and getting kicked off my family's plan at LifeCenter.  But at least I had two e-cards waiting for me - one from WebShots.com and the other from Netscape.com.  I'm so glad that these corporations as so concerned with my happiness... -  Family = Talk about frustrating.  I'm so disappointed in my relationship with my family right now - I feel like a stranger whenever I go over there any more.  Not that I usually want to go over there - it's nice to be "home" and all, but it just always seems like I end up mediating a fight.  And my mom is being a real brat lately (or maybe I'm just becoming more aware of it)...sometimes I don't know how my dad puts up with it.  But I was thinking about it the other day, and I think she might be acting that way to get attention (basically, for the same reasons a little kid acts like that); of course, being "touchy-feely" isn't exactly a strength of my family.  Plus, I think that she might not be taking her meds...and she's been working a lot more lately (she got the job with LifeCenter).  And my perception of my dad has been totally shattered over the past year or so - I used to really look up to him in both a personal and spirital sense, but it seems like every time I'm home my mom is critisizing him, and there's only so much of that you can take before your perception of someone starts to get worn down (especially when some of the criticism is based upon objective facts).  That being said, we got to go out and play some racquetball the other day (I got spanked) - it felt really good to just be able to do somethin with him (not that we could actually do something just he and I - everyone else had to come, and I'm too "nice" to object - not that I knew everyone else was comin prior to them walking through the door).  And I just hate the "economic" mindset of things at home - everything is about money or something related to earning money (reputation, credentials, etc.) - I'm just not wired that way, there's other things more important to me than making money, and it just seems like I always get into arguments over my priorities, etc.  (I still don't think they know I'm a closet socialist :P).  Oh, and they could be moving in with my Grandma soon (it's about time, if you ask me)...they're going to try to rent out the house in Hudson.  But at least I'll be in Washington by then... -  Money (Part II) - I've only recently been realizing how much money actually impacts my thinking (and yes, I blame it on my parents) - I almost threw up the other day when it finally hit me how many of my decisions are purely motivated by economic considerations.  But at least I found it somewhat satisfying to realize that the decisions I've made NOT based upon economic considerations are the ones I'm happiest with...hmm, maybe I should take a cue from that? -  Metaphysics = Yes, time to venture into the weirdest parts of the weird world of Mike.  I finally got up the gumption (yes, that IS a word) to talk to Dave (the leader of my Sunday School class) about two of the primary questions I've been having, but I have to admit that he wasn't really much of a help.  I'm still struggling with my "Christianity Belief Equation" (i.e. God exists --> Jehovah is God --> Jesus is Jehovah), primarily in forming some way of believing the middle assertion (Jehovah is God) based upon some form of rational reasoning.  All I've gotten so far is "It's just something you just have faith in" (I HATE THAT ANSWER).  Of course, that segways into my second question - inasmuch as salvation is based upon faith and faith is based upon belief, wouldn't it make sense that salvation ceases to exist if belief ceases to be absolute?  Grr...sometimes I wonder why I wonder abou this stuff...I would describe myself as a person with a perpetually troubled spirit - "tranquility" and "certain" are not typically words associated with my spiritual state.  So anyway, the question about belief and salvation really troubles me - I've always believed in absolute salvation, but I just don't see how it can be the case if my equation holds true.  And with me questioning the middle principle of my "Christianity Belief Equation" (and thus the subsequent assertion based upon it), wouldn't that mean that I am in a state of non-salvation?  LOL...just another one of those inconsequential questions I wrestle with all the time...I need to take a cue froim my HS football coach and "STOP THINKING!!" for my own good ;)

						   OK...let's see here, it's 12:30 and I'm just substantively starting on my Direct Democracy paper with 30% of my grade.  Glad to see that the more things change, the more they stay the same...  Well, after such an awesome beginning to my day things went decidedly downhill.  Before heading out to school I figure I would check up on the special circumstances form that we sent in - so I check on the Net and find out they (finally) processed it.  At this point I get that gut-wrenching sense of anticipation somewhat like what you feel right before you get a test back - how much I get back from this will highly dictate how much loan money I have to take out for Washington.  So I go to check on the Financial Aid page...and nothing.  I didn't get a freaking thing more than I got from my FAFSA application.  I don't get it - last year I was in virtually the same circumstance and got a LOT of money, yet this year they don't even bump up the amount of subsidized loans I can get.  So anyway...on this cheery note I head off to school.  Which was relatively banal except for the giddiness of knowing that it was the last day of classes! :-D  Got all the review sheets and all....oh, and in what is perhaps my hardest class we got a take-home exam (which is definitely a good thing).  But the quesrtions is odd - it's not really about the substance of the class, but about the class itself (kind of like an evaluation)...  So anyway...get home, decide I don't want to start working right away, so I plump down for some TV.  Watch U-571 on TNT (or maybe it was USA...whatever), then suddenly am overcome with a great weariness (could it have something to do with going to bed at 12:30 and then waking up @ 5:30 for basketball?  Maybe?).    So go upstairs and take a nap from 6:00 to 8:00 (I'm just starting to remember how messed up my sleeping patterns become during exams time).  Wake up, come downstairs...and of course the MAC championship is on ESPN2 (between BG and Miami @ Oxford, so of course I feel a compelling interest to watch since it's 2 Ohio teams).  But here is where having a laptop is beautiful...I can just lug it on into the TV room and actually start working on my paper while watching the game (at least, that's the plan - I think it was about a 60-40 split between the game and my paper).  So here I am, once again, beginning a paper at an ungodly hour...good thing I planned for it ;)  Oh, in reference to Lisa's blog...I second the motion to take the "None of the above" option off tests, but could we perhaps add it to election ballots? :P

						   I have come to two realization in the last couple of days.  One, I am getting fat - not a little overweight, not "husky," but approaching fat.  Something must be done - I'm just not sure what it , but it needs to be done soon!  Two, my weird outlook on life is due to the following perpetual realization:  Things ain't as bad as they seem, but they ain't as good as I wish they were.  OK, back to whatever boring homework I was working on...

						   In talking with a lot of people I've realized that Vertical Horizon really hit upon something deep in their song "Finding Me."  One of the lines of the song goes, "Don't tell me how to be, 'cause I like some suffering.  Don't ask me what I need, 'cause I'm just fine finding me."    I think this is totally how some of us live - for some inexplicable reason we actually WANT to be lost, actually want to be suffering because we don't know what our purpose is and/or because we aren't fulfilling it (for many people, this means "being" a Christian but not really embracing what being a Christian means and entails).  There is some strange comfort in being that way, perhaps because it's what we're used to, or perhaps because we know we have no responsibility in that place.  Whatever the reason, we know it's destructive, it's not how things are meant to be, and yet it is so human-like to simply sit there and rebel, to arrogantly bask in our ability to choose to be lost.  Such a strange concept - to be knowingly lost, to know that we can find our way (even if we don't exactly know what it is), and to simply choose not to search and/or find that way.  Most of us would be completely content to stay in that position if not for a small voice in the back of our head telling us that it isn't the way things were meant to be, that it isn't what we were created for, that there is something better out there, that we could be so much happier if we would just do what we know we ought to (even if we don't necessarily know what that is, we know we could find out).  And that small voice is precisely why it's such a painful position, why rebellion is usually so unsatisfying.  Without any outright comment we know that we are half-empty vessels not really living up to our potential, and in doing so not really embracing the essence of our humanity, not to mention the essence of ourselves (i.e. personally).  I'm not really sure what I'm trying to say here except that I really wish that more of us (myself included, btw) would just get over this crazy lifestyle and philosophy.  Living like this isn't really living - it's slowly dying, it's wasteful, it's downright sad.  A lot of the time when I'm talking with people I get this sense that there is a great hesitation which pervades their entire life and holds them back from doing what they know is right, or from doing what they've always wanted to, and I think that in many instances this great hesitation is a fear of finding out who they really are.  Because to find out who we are would be to confront the purpose we were made for, and to confront the purpose we were made for would force an explicit choice on whether to live like that or not, something we don't want to face.  But it is something we MUST face, something that in the end will give us the greatest joy and happniess and peace that we could ever imagine if we would just embrace God's plan for us and the way He wants us to live wholeheartedly; at the least it is something that would force us out of our catatonic states and inject a life we didn't know before.  And I think this is something we all yearn for more than anything else, we just have to get over ourselves and accept it

						   I’m frustrated with myself. For some reason I’m just such a recluse; the first day or so we were here (D.C.) I was relatively outgoing (for me), but I can already tell that I’m starting so settle into the mindset that I’m going to spend a lot of time in my room or doing things on my own. I don’t really seem to be apart of any “group” around here (I’m not a partier, don’t really drink, aren’t that good of a socializer, not that interested in politics), so I guess that relegates me to my usual “loner” status. Oh, and it doesn’t really seem like there’s any other Christians in our group, so that’s kinda made things weird for me, too. I’ve done a couple of things with Ryan and Josh (that’s his name!), and they seem real cool, but it just seems like I have this inherent pull telling me to be at “home,” to not try to do too many crazy things. Maybe it’s wise to keep myself out of situations that I don’t really want to be in, but it just seems that it’s also cowardice and self-defeat; I guess it all goes back to what I said in Sunday School when I was about 10 or so when they asked what our greatest fears were: failure and rejection. Maybe this is just an insulating tactic to try to avoid those two (as Homer S. once said, “Trying is the first step towards failure”), but it just seems to have so many negative byproducts, isolation and malaise chief among them. But this is only the second day, so maybe things will get better…

						   OK, wow, I've got to get something up here aside from that pitiful "plea" - it's making me depressed every time I look at my own blog (as truthful as it may be or have been).  Things are goin great - I'm starting to get into the swing of things for the D.C. trip, and I am starting to feel much freer now that I'm almost done with Lianda (just the audit tomorrrow!).  It's been great being there, but sometimes CHANGE IS GOOD!  Aside from this...I like the group for the D.C. trip, it could be a lot of fun AND quite an experience.  I've started another blog just for the trip, so if you want to read about it go  urlLink here .  I don't know how much more I'm going to be updating this blog once I'm in D.C. - I'll probably put the "personal" stuff here and the day-to-day happenings on there.  But we'll see...

						   Well, I got a wake-up call today - I've gotta turn my life around right now.  Not that it's totally horrible, mind you, but it's not much of a life, at least I don't think so.  And it seems that things are getting worse before they're getting better.  Allow me to explain.  This whole train of thought probably started percolating sometime around Christmas - it's supposed to be a time of joy, of laughter and fun and giving, but it most certainly didn't seem like any of those things for me.  The things that I actually enjoyed doing (being with friends & family, helping at church, etc.) just didn't seem to have the meaning or essence to them that makes them so much fun for me.  And the whole season seemed dead - instead of being a celebration of Christ's birth and all it seemed like an abyss of melancholy, like everything good about it just fell off a cliff before it got to me.  Any spiritual significance seemed gone, and that really got me wondering why.  I won't go so far as to say that I got worried about it - "concerned" is probably a better word - but this whole sense of spiritual emptiness and loneliness seemed to have been dogging me for a while and I needed to confront it.  I just seem to have drifted so far away from who I want to be that it seems that I can't even remember what that was or why I wanted to be that way aside from a few superficial vestiges belying the deeper reasons.    I went to a get-together with some of the guys from Mr. Robinson's Bible study during break and Jon was asking everyone what God had been teaching them over the past semester.  I have to admit that I felt both relief and disappointment that I had to leave before my turn came up - relief that I didn't have to admit that I didn't think I had learned anything about God over the last six months and that He'd seemed pretty dead to me for a long time, but disappointment that I didn't have the opportunity to confess this to some guys who might actually be able to help me.  I thought I might bring it up later, but of course I didn't.  Heck, everyone probably thinks that I'm just peachy aside from being a little moody every once in a while.  Oh, what people don't know and don't want to find out.  Truth is, I've been alienated from myself and my beliefs for a long time now.  Marxian scholars speak of a "false consciousness" impressed upon oppressed classes which cause them to accept their oppression because they do not see it as that - they are blinded to the reality around them, divorced from the knowledge and wisdom which would open their eyes to the situation they are in.  I feel the same way - I feel like I've been so divorced from my beliefs that I have forgotten they are my beliefs, so estranged from my God that I forget He exists and what His presence is like.  Life goes on, day by day, not moments to be lived in but moments to be gotten by.  Life is not a mission but an endless stream of faceless things, faceless events, faceless people, occassionally punctuated by something reminding me that life can be more.  But life can only be something more with a purpose, a reason for making the extra effort to come out of the cave and see the sun.  But I don't know what that purpose is.  Every time that I try to rediscover it it just seems like I run into the same roadblocks - my damned questions about everything which never seem to get adequate answers, my lack of faith, my twisted logic, my laziness.    They gave out calendars at church with a schedule for reading through the Bible in a year and I made up my mind I was going to try it - of course, I haven't broken the cover of my Bible in about two months or so (including when I go to church), so trying to do so now hasn't exactly been easy.  Actually, it's the 6th of January and I still haven't started - I just feel so intimidated by actually reading the Bible.  I just think up questions and can't answer them and I'm too lazy to actually research things and I don't feel right just outright asking people because I don't want to put them on the spot...  And then there was what happened today.  Just a routine doctors checkup before I go to D.C. and all (the preparations for which are a whole story on their own), but I got the aforementioned wake-up call.  I probably should have seen it coming, but maybe it was just having a doctor tell me about it that brought it into focus.  Basically, I'm getting too unhealthy.  I used to always rely on sports and all to keep me in shape (and even when I was playing sports I never worked out on the side), so when I stopped playing three years ago I didn't really have a plan for staying in shape or anything aside from trying to work out when I can, secretly hoping that I would find someone else who I could work out with and who would push me to do so.  I believe that I can now say that this lack of planning and support is an unqualified disaster - during the checkup the doctor was telling me how I was adding to my risks for this and that because of the way I was living and all (and he was right).  So now I need to start doing something about this - and I feel just as helpless about this as I do about the whole relationship-with-God thing.  The funamental problem is that I don't know where to start on either of them.  I've become so accustomed to a certain way of life, a certain way of doing things, a certain mindset, that I don't have the first idea about where to start changing, but I know that if I stay the way I am now I'm only going to be miserable (both now and later).  But I think the operative word here is helpless - Lord knows this isn't the first time I've tried to turn things around, and after a certain number of attempts one starts to become defeatist.  I know I'm a high-maintenance person sometimes, but it seems like I'm always getting the low-maintenance treatment.  Sometimes I wish I had joined the Army or something, not because I especially want to go into combat, but because I need someone to be pushing me, telling me I can do better.  It seems like right now everyone is saying I'm doing well enough and leaving it at that, either not taking the time to really find out how things are going or not caring one way or the other.  And I hate the way that I keep waiting for someone to come along and actually have faith in me, someone who will push me to be better because they know I can be.  But it doesn't seem like anyone has that kind of faith in me, and I certainly don't have it in myself...  Anyway, maybe this is just a depressive tirade, but I don't think so - I feel fine right now, and I've become very aware of when I'm getting depressed.  I think it's more desperation - if this sounds like a cry for help, well, that's exactly what it is.  I'm at my wits end about what to do here, and maybe getting it all down will help me come to some conclusions (aside from the thereaputic affects of directing my comments at a fictionalized audience and imaging someone gives a damn)...

						   You ever have one of those weird, really strong deja vu-type flashbacks from doing the same thing in the same place that you did before?  Yeah, had one of those today - got a little misty, for a second I thought I was lose it in the utility room I was painting :P  When am I ever gonna get that girl out of my head...?  Anyway...if anyone wants more details than that you're gonna have to ask, 'cause that's definitely all I'm putting about that on here. :P

						   When it takes you 20 minutes to get to a point where you THINK that you got all the mud off you, and this is even after having taken a dip in a freezing lake, then you know you're having fun! :)  So here's to playing ultimate frisbee in shorts, a t-shirt, and bare feet after two days of rain and 50 degree weather :D  I'll have a pic coming later that I think describes all anyone needs to know about the game ;)  For my part, I think that was the most exhilarating experience I've had since I stopped playing football. :)  And yes, I just can't stop smiling :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :D :D :D :D :D

						   After nearly a week of careful observation, I have decided that Danielle was right - I do "tailgate" people sometimes.  Not that I really plan on changing this (it DOES make them speed up and/or get out of the way most of the time), but it was a good observation.  Now I just have to hope that my insurance agent never stumbles upon this blog... (but I'VE NEVER GOTTEN IN AN ACCIDENT...at least, not one that had any reports filed and/or caused any "serious" damage to anything except my wallet).

						   I've been off-and-on reading "Reaching for the Invisible God" by Philip Yancey and I came across some really personally encouraging / challenging / reassuring stuff today.  I thought I'd post them in case they helped anyone else and so I could reference them myself later...  "The times when I feel most estranged from God can bring on a sense of desperation, which presents a new starting point for grace."  "God can forgive any sin and can deal with any spiritual condition.  We fall down, we get up, a pattern the Bible amply illustrated, as with David and Peter.  God does require honesty, thought.  We dare not misrepresent ourselves to God, for by doing so, we close our hands to grace."  "As long as we do not become inured to the pain around us and in us, and indifferent to the world's fallenness, as long as we do not feel too at home here, we allow space for God to enter."  "My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going.  I do not see the road ahead of me.  I cannot know for certain where it will end.  Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so.  But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you." - Thomas Merton  "Somehow, somewhere, I I know that He loves me, even though I do not feel that love as I can feel a human embrace, even though I do not hear a voice as I hear human words of consolation, even though I do not see a smile, as I can see in a human face.  Still God speaks to me, looks at me, and embraces me there, where I am still unable to notice." - Henri Nouwen  "The burning of a little straw may hide the stars, but the stars outlast the smoke." - Voltaire

						   This evening has been interesting; heck, this whole week has been “interesting.”  I don’t know what it is, but it seemed like something clicked for me tonight.  Whether it’ll stay clicked or just be a one-night thing, I don’t know, but here’ hoping it lasts.  A little background.  The whole time I’ve been up here I’ve been really struggling with how to be a Christian in this kind of environment (i.e. very secular, with little or no proximate support).  I’ll be the first to say that things have slipped a little (which isn’t really saying much considering what I was like before I came here).  But it’s been a real struggle – how do you live Christianity when you’re surrounded by relativism (even if it doesn’t go by that name)?  And even harder, how to you speak Christianity when it’s not something anyone wants to hear (in fact, when it’s usually something ridiculed).  And how do you do that when you’re already an outsider?  I know a lot of people will probably say that I need to get locked into a local church or something, but I have to admit that my experience with the Church has been really mixed.  I’ve never really found anyone who was willing to “mentor” me or anything, and I’ve had only marginally more success actually having someone express an interest in my life (nevermind my spiritual condition or anything like that).  So I haven’t really made a whole lot of an effort to find a church around here – I’m definitely going to put more effort into it next week, but as you can probably ascertain, I’m not too hopeful in finding anything meaningful.  Sure, it will be nice to be around a lot of other people that purport to believe the same way I do, but I’ve become so disillusioned by the number of people who claim to be Christian but don’t act like it, who don’t have the passion or fire for it that I’m looking for and can look up to, that I can try to emulate.  I don’t know what it is about me, whether it’s the fact that I’ve never really had a lot of close friends (outside of my family) or that it takes me forever (years) to get to know people and feel comfortable around them, or whether I just don’t know how to be proactive in getting to know people, but I’m always a loner.  A bunch of times while I’ve been down here I’ve turned down opportunities to go out and doing things with other people in our group; I think that a lot of the time it’s because I feel like I’m not very good with people and that I’m so old-fashioned, I’ll just hold everyone back and make them not like me even more.  And a lot of the time it’s also because I know that they’re probably going to be doing or talking about things that I disagree with, and I’ve always tried to keep myself out of those kinds of situations – but maybe that isn’t such a good idea right now, maybe that’s something I need to change.  One can imagine that all of these problems and thoughts have been compounded by the nature of my internship (i.e. I have to go represent a lot of people that I really disagree with).  But at the same time it’s also given me some hope that I’m finally doing something because I think it’s the right thing to do – there people are the ones that are the most put down, the ones that everyone overlooks, and they are exactly the ones that I want to help the most.  I’m not kidding when I say this is what I want to do, not just as a short-term thing to “get it out of my system,” but as something that it an integral part of my life.  Maybe it won’t be defense work, but I know that it is something I’m going to be involved with in some way.  Anyway, all of this being said, I actually went out and did some things with people tonight; one of the girls’ rooms was having dinner for everyone (the girl cooking was Indian, so it was Indian food, and I thought it was pretty good – spicy, but good J), so I roused myself off the couch and went down with the other guys (with trepidation, I might add, but everything was cool once I got there).  So that was cool – maybe this was the first step towards breaking down some of the walls I’ve created around myself and actually coming out of my shell a little.  But we’ll see about that one – I’ve been saying I needed to do that for a long time now.  Part of the things about today was the fact that we finished our training for the internship, and one of the things I’ve realized is that I’m going to have to change my personality a little bit if I’m going to do a good job at this internship.  We were doing an exercise today where I was supposed to give someone a hard time and I JUST COULDN’T DO IT; being assertive and/or confrontational is something I have a really hard time with.  But I’m going to have to become more like that with this internship; the stakes are too high for me to just give up on things and avoid confrontations (depending on the cases I’m working with, our client could lose years of their life in jail).  And surprisingly, I think I can actually do this – I’ve found myself “conforming to the role” a little during training, and I know that things are going to become much more real to me when we start tomorrow.  But I think that the biggest thing that happened tonight was something small, something I haven’t had happen in a long time and something I’ve been missing for so long – I noticed the stars.  I was walking home from working out tonight and I actually had a sense of awe looking up at them.  Maybe this is all really weird for anyone else reading this, but I’ve always drawn a sense of comfort from nature, and especially the stars.  It’s something about knowing that those beautiful specks of light are actually hundreds of times larger than anything we can comprehend and millions of miles away and yet their light reaches all the way to this planet, to this hemisphere, to this country, to this region, and ultimately to where I’m standing – and that they’ve been doing this for as long as humanity has existed.  There’s something about the combination of the eternality and temporal nature of it that is just awe-inspiritng and gives me such a sense of comfort knowing that if God took the time to place them in their perfect orders, then he undoubtedly has the ability to work in my life and change things for the better.  If only I could somehow bypass this whole free-will thing…  Anyway, I don’t remember who said it, but one of the quotes I have is “The world will perish not for lack of wonders, but for lack of wonder.”  I totally agree – and I love this feeling of being in awe, of knowing that everything will be ok because someone is looking out for me, that somehow things will work out.  If only I could stay this serene…

						   Court-watching  The lawyer I spoke with the other day invited me down to view on her trials today, so I went down to the Akron courthouse.  At least, I THOUGHT it was today - turns out that it isn't until tomorrow :P  And there weren't any other trials going on today (which I couldn't believe, but 'tis true), so I basically went down there for nothing (although it was helpful to find out where the courthouse was :).  But I think it's kind of ironic that I spent all of last semester working with an attorney in the DC Public Defender's Office and I didn't get to a trial (they have a LOT of them every day over there).  Oh, and it's also ironic that the one case we had last semester that went to trial is going on right now (and my partner is testifying in it :).

						   Woohoo! :)  The last couple of days have been good on the job front.  I sent out my letters to law firms on Monday, and I got a call from a woman who does family and criminal law yesterday.  We actually were even able to get together and talk last night, but neither of us were sure about whether or how much she could use me.  But it was really nice to get a lead! :)  So then today I had interviews with two temp agencies.  Quite honestly, I don't know why I didn't look into them before!  My testing went REALLY well (I typed in the mid-70 wpm :), and they were virtually gushing over my resume and skills set and all (wait...ouch...trying to pat yourself on the back like that puts your arm in an awkward position ;).  So anyway...it looks like they might be able to find me a pretty well-paying job, but it could be pretty interesting since I signed up with two of them and I don't know what I'm going to do if one of them offers me a position.  But it's a nice problem to have... :)  But I have to say that some of the testing was kinda stupid, and then some of it was kinda hard.  I mean, I had to take a test on grammar (aced it :D), spelling (aced that one too :D), typing, alpha-keying, etc. etc. etc. (and it's been a long time since I've had to do long multiplication or division by hand!).  But then there were the tests on Word and Excel and whatnot where the test virtually told you what the answer was :P

						    Job-Hunting (Part II) and Atkins   I can't believe this - despite having a summa cum laude degree from KSU and being 6'2'', 270 lb. (meaning I'm both smart AND big), I can't get a freaking job this summer!  I went to five or six landscaping places today and asked if any of them needed summer workers - nada.  Put in an application at Lowe's - haven't heard back.  Talked to folks from two roofing companies - all filled.  Heck, I even sent an e-mail (plea?) to Lianda, but I haven't heard back from them, either (in fairness, I sent it Wed.)!  Ah well, suppose I'll have to keep scouring the classifieds and keeping up with the stuff here around the house.  Oh, and I'm sending out my law-firm canvassing letters today (38 of them at last count), so MAYBE I'll snag something there.  And as if not having a job wasn't bad enough, now I can't eat virtually anything I really like! :P  I have to admit I never realized how much stuff was in most of the things we eat - I wasn't exactly a "label-watcher" - but not that I'm on Atkins it's kinda crazy how much stuff I CAN'T eat.  I mean, my three main food groups were bread, pasta, and Cool-Aid (I lived off frozen pizzas for over a month in DC :D) - now, all of them are out the door.  The things we do to be "healthy"...

						    Job-Hunting   I am definitely being reminded why I HATE job-hunting right now.  I'm running the gammut of summer jobs; so far I have applications out for legal positions (reseach or investigative), landscaping, roofing, UPS, and clerical/administrative.  So far, no takers (I've only had three people even call me back).    In case I didn't already hate it enough, my dumb Spanish class is causing a lot of problems finding someone who will go with my schedule; in a perfect world I would be able to work two or three days a week, intern with the Cleveland Public Defender a couple of days a week, and still get my Spanish class out of the way (fortunately, I don't have to make TOO much money this summer :).  And I have to admit it would be kinda nice to get a manual labor / outside job so I could get tan and a workout every day ;)  Ah well, at least there's still volleyball virtually every night, basketball in the EARLY morning (it's been SO wonderful being able to go play and then come back and go back to bed), and softball.  Now I just need to get good at one of them... :D

						    All Walks of Life   I had an "information session" at the UPS Employment Center today, and I absolutely couldn't believe the vast range of people who were there!  I mean, some of the people came to this meeting in business suits (for a package-handler job paying $8.50/hr.).  Of course, some people there also looked like they could hardly stand up, and I really wonder about all of this...I mean, if the economy is so bad that we have people applying for barely-minimum-wage jobs in business suits, what happens to the people at the lower end whose jobs they take?  This whole looking-for-a-job thing has also been quite the eye-opener.  I had it SO good back when I was working for Lianda and didn't have to worry about finding a job every summer!  But now...well, there isn't really anything available in the legal field (at least, that I've been able to find or that anyone has told me about), so it looks like I'm going to plan B:  manual labor.  But hey, this could be the perfect combo:  if I can work and get in shape at the same time, then do some interning with the Cleveland Public Defender, that would be the best of both worlds! (aside from the $8.50/hr., but I can manage...)  It's also opened my eyes to how hard it must be for people with "just" high school diplomas and whatnot to get jobs that actually pay anything. It was only partially a defense (and mostly the truth) when people at the DC Public Defender said that a lot of the people caught dealing drugs did so because it was the most feasible way for people down there to make money.  It was pretty much that or work at McDonald's or Starbucks or some place like that - and when it comes down to making $50 or $250 a night, I think the answer would be pretty obvious for most of us, too.

						   Let me temper my comments from last night... Contrary to what it sounds like, I'm not a raving lunatic (at least, I don't think so).  I think the genesis of all my comments is a lingering (and active) bitterness I have about my so-called life; it just seems like in so many ways all I meet is frustration.  And the source of the frustration seems to be an inability to actually go and do what I want to do - I'm always too concerned with what other people think and pleasing them.  But the opposite is true, too - I'm very susceptible to joining something wholeheartedly if I'm given encouragement.  So in many ways I feel like I'm upset that I'm being discouraged to do things that I think are worthwhile and principled (by people who claim to have the same values as myself), while not being encouraged to do things that I know I ought to be doing and just don't seem to be able to do on my own.  There just doesn't seem to be that unconditional support from any source.  But I was thinking about it this morning, and I think that I'm going to start having a more careless attitude (somewhat like I used to have).  Maybe sometimes it's ok to have people angry or disillusioned with you, to strike out on your own and cut some ties.  Maybe it's even ok to take on an entire society.  Of course, the part that's going to hurt is that the people I feel I'm going to most alienate are those closest to me, the ones who SHOULD be supporting me, and I just don't know what other support group I'm going to be able to come up with.  Anyway...I realize that all of this is relatively pie-in-the-sky right now until I start making some actual changes, but I still don't know what changes I'm going to make.  But I know I can't stay the way I am...

						   I'm sure that this isn't a surprise to any of you, but I'm just not normal.  For some reason such revelations actually surprise me - I guess that deep down I just want to have a "normal" life with a "normal" perspective and "normal" relationships.  Of course, the whole "normal" paradigm is a figment of imagination (largely constructed by fanciful and/or incomplete accountings of what life should be), but I think that there are certain aspects of "normalcy" that I just don't measure up in.  Take school, for example.  One would think that I just got back from an awesome experience in DC, I'm one class from being finished with college, and I get to start law school (virtually for free!) in the fall, so I should be excited and upbeat about things!  Nope.  Quite the opposite, actually - I wasn't exactly a wild man about graduating from high school, either, but I don't even think I'm going to go to my college graduation (for what?  So I can wait for four hours for someone to call my name - which no one would recognize - and then go home and try to figure out what needs to be done around the house?).  But this total lack of excitement puzzles me somewhat - instead of gaining any sort of satisfaction from the "accomplishment" of graduating from college, I'm already focused on (worrying about?) law school and what I want to do with my career.  Just like high school, college seems like just another necessary step towards whatever future I might have, just another piece of paper I need to have signed so I can be "eligible" to do what I want to (even if I'm not sure what that is yet).    And it's all so frustrating - this mechanical perspective on everything leaves me with such a sense of malaise that I'm not even sure why I put myself through it.  I used to pride myself on how hard I worked on things, how attentive I was - now I'm just the opposite, always looking for the easiest way to do the most obvious things.  I've pretty much stuck with the whole "I've-always-wanted-to-be-a-lawyer" routine, but I'm not sure about that any more; from my experience in DC the legal (NOT justice) system is so messed up (both in procedure and practice) that I'm not sure I want to get involved in it.  More and more I've become convinced that if I go into law I want to be some type of reformer (if even in the smallest sense - maybe become a judge or something), but I just don't seem to have my heart in it.  While I was in DC I toyed with the notion of going into one of the law enforcement agencies (FBI? Secret Service?), and I've thought about going into the military before - I think it all boils down to the fact that I want to be DOING things, not simply get stuck behind a desk somewhere.  Or maybe I want to go work for the Peace Corp or for some refugee agency in some remote corner of the world - anything to feel like I'm practically helping people, not just sitting there pretending to work "in the name of justice" and really just pushing paper around to help line people's pockets.  I know some of you think I'm hopelessly idealistic and naive to think that I can try to help people instead of make money, that I need to come back to reality and just accept that this is the way the world works.  But let me just say that I think those of you who say this are the very root of everything that's wrong with our society, even moreso than the "immoral" people who think that gay marriage and abortion are ok, because I've seen more of "them" show real concern for the people who are hurting and in need than I've seen Christians do so.  I told a friend of mine the other day that I have a "love/hate relationship" with Christianity and Christians: on the one hand the message seems great and all, but on the other it seems so phony because I don't see it actually having an impact in people's lives, I don't see anyone living it.    I was reading a book entitled The Jesus I Never Knew by Philip Yancey while I was in DC; in the book Yancey goes over all the things about Christ we like to ignore, like how he was probably dirt poor, a social outcast, a political radical, a philosophical paradox, a challenge to every status quo ever invented by man.  I couldn't finish the book; everything that Yancey said about Christ, all of the things that make him so illogical, appealed to me at the most fundamental level, but I just couldn't imagine living like that in my "Christian" environment.  But I think that Yancey has it right; I think that if someone's going to follow Jesus teachings they are going to have to be a social outcast, a political radical, a philosophical paradox, and a challenge to the status quo on some level, and I just don't see any Christians actually living like that (at least, none that are willing to actually let me get close to them).  Sure, I read about some, and every once in a great while there might be a missionary floating through who will stand at the front of the church and tell great stories or an acquaintance who seems to be a little different; but where are the masses of people who should be changed by such a radical message?  I mean, if it really is everything Christians say it is, shouldn't it by a dynamic influence on society instead of being perceived as an antiquated ethos of yesteryear?  In case I haven't stood on my soap box enough, let me vent a bit more.  Maybe it's just because of the Christian crowd that I know, but I always hear everyone talking about the "horrible court cases guiding our country to destruction" or the catastrophic bent politicians are taking these days.  First, let me say that a court case is just that - a court case.  If you really stop to think about it, how has a Supreme Court decision ever pragmatically effected any of us?  And having been in Washington for the last three months and having met with a lot of the "horrible politicians" that everyone I know complains about, let me break something to you: they're good people!  In fact, many of the people that I found myself respecting most because of the things they were doing to actually try to help people were the very ones who are most hated in "my circles" (cite Rep. Kucinich, Brown, and Ryan), and the ones that I loathed for their social policies are the ones that "we" like (mainly the Bush Admin).  What I think it all boils down to is money and our (conservative) American fixation on it.  Somehow we've come up with the notion that we each need to somehow earn our health, our salary, our job, and that to give these things to someone else is somehow cheating (both them and, more importantly, ourselves).  In fact, it's worse than cheating, it's stealing; what gives them the right to demand us to pay for their inadequacies with our hard-earned money (be it through higher taxes or through other forms of wealth redistribution)?!    Well, my answer is quite simple:  you don't give enough of your money away to help these people when they don't ask for it, so now they have to demand it to survive and compete in the world you've created!  However, let me first point out the flaws in the basic reasoning: no one earns their health(care), which is dictated by God and circumstance; very few actually earn their salaries, especially compared with what most people on earth make, and a lot of wealth is transferred through non-wage methods like inheritances and trust funds anyway; and the old adage that "it's who you know, not what you know" certainly holds true about people's positions, so most don't really "earn" those, either.  But let's assume for a second that most people did "earn" what they have.  Well, if these people were Christians, then I think that their perspective on what they use their money, positions, etc. for should change, should differ from the way "the world" sees things.  Over and over in the Bible I hear about unconditional love, turning the other cheek, going the extra mile, giving away the extra cloak, pooling resources for the communal good, "going low" to help those less fortunate; so where's all the money and resources going?  I mean, I realize that Christians are a minority in this country and all, but I still think that we should be able to make a bigger dent on society than we are!  I mean, where's the money for the homeless shelters (right now there are over 1000 homeless people in DC the shelters can't hold); where's the money for AIDS research (all the arguments about it being a "moral" disease are garbage - they're people who need help, and we ought to help and love them regardless of what disease they have or how they got it); where's the money for drug or alcohol abuse programs, or prisoner release programs, or juvenile offender programs?  And more importantly, where's the people dedicated to these problems and so many more like them?!  Perhaps the thing that hurt me most in DC was what I didn't see (and the same holds true for Akron and Cleveland and my general perception of the rest of the US): I didn't see Christians sacrificing their careers and other things to "go low" and take positions where they actually helped people.  I didn't meet a single Christian in the Public Defender's office; I didn't meet a single Christian asking the government for more money for homeless shelters, treatment programs, prison reform, or other lower-class social issues; I didn't meet a single Christian who went down into the inner city and tried to help the thousands hooked on drugs or alcohol, who are from broken families where they don't even know who their father is, or whose entire neighborhoods are caught in an endless cycle of violence and incarceration.  Now in fairness I claim ignorance about the last point - I passed by many black churches I could tell were really trying to help their communities and never went into any of them.  But where's the support from those that have the ability to give it?!  Now some might say that it's irresponsible for a Christian man (or woman) to hurt their family (either the one they have or the one they might have) by taking such traditionally low-wage positions, some of which may be downright dangerous.  My retort is simply this:  who else is going to do it and what makes it more "logical" or "right" for a non-Christian person to do so?  One of the things that I've heard many Christians talk about is how there is a "fundamental morality" inherent in each person that doesn't need to be explained or taught; however, many of the tenants of this "fundamental morality" Christ proclaimed are better understood and practiced by many of the secular people I know (who don't know that Christ said a word about them) than by most of the Christians I know.  What makes it somehow all right for them to heed their internal calling and wrong for us (and more specifically, I) to ignore like urges in the face of explicit commands?!  Well, enough ranting for one night.  This blog certainly didn't go the way I thought it would - I didn't even get to talk about my social ineptness or utter loneliness, but I suppose those can be foregone for another day (I know you're all just looking forward to THAT :P).  But anyway...if anyone ever feels the need to get into a nice fight, I suppose I gave you a couple of good buttons to push with me here, eh?

						   You ever have one of those dreams where you're actually so engrossed in it, where you're subconsciously sifting through something by it, and when you wake up you decide all you want to do is go back to sleep so you can finish the dream?  Yeah, had one of those today - I don't remember everything about it, but I do remember that virtually the whole thing was just talking with  her , and it was such a letdown to wake up and realize that it wasn't real.  So I promptly turned over and went back to sleep just so I could go back to the dream, so real life could get put on hold for a little while and things could be like I wished they were.  I don't know what it is, but there's something in me that just can't seem to let go, that seems to have a grasp so tight on those memories and feelings that I just can't get them out of my head.  Anyway, I'm rambling on like I'm drunk (which I'm NOT)...  Spanish went ok today (inasmuch as any day with Spanish can be "ok").  I got back my test from last week (the one I pulled an all-nighter for); I did a LOT better than I thought I was going to (I was hoping for a D and got an A ;), but I think a lot of that had to do with the fact that the teacher was really lenient with how he graded them (I wouldn't have given myself any points for a lot of the mistakes I made!).  Not much to report from the Public Defender today; I basically went up, sat in my cubicle for a while, ran over some filings, then came home when they didn't have anything else for me to do.  John said that things should be picking up for me later this week, but then I got a phone call from my temp agency and they said that they have something for me for the rest of this week and all of next week, so I'm not going to turn that down!  But I am going to miss working for the public defender for that time...

						   I spent most of today at a mock trial for the Cleveland Bar Association.  I was selected as one of the jurors for the trial (there were 4 of us); I had testified as one of the mock witnesses earlier in the week (even if I WAS nearly 45 minutes late :P), so it was kind of fun to be able to sit in on the whole trial and hear the entire case from another perspective.  The gyst of the case was that a judge had been found dead in his home while being investigated for a large amount of missing funds from his fines and fees collections.  He had recently taken out a life insurance policy ($500,000), so the question we were looking at during the trial was whether his death was an accident (in which his widow would recover the whole amount) or a suicide (in which she would get only the amount he had paid for the insurance).    I know this isn't what you're supposed to do, but from what I had testified about earlier in the week I thought that the guy had definitely committed suicide.  Of course, I was testifying as the person who was looking into the missing amounts of money from his fines and collections, so my perspective was pretty skewed.  But as we heard the whole case (the trial took about 4 hours, with two witnesses each for the plaintiff and the defense), it became pretty clear that he hadn't killed himself after all.  The primary thing which led us to this conclusion (we all said it was an accident) was the testimony of the coroner and a demonstration that the plaintiff put on which proved that it would have been virtually impossible for the judge to hold the gun and shoot himself and leave the blood marks left behind.  Anyway, enough of the technical details :P  The whole thing was really great for me; the defense and the plaintiffs both did a really good job in presenting their cases, and the judge presiding over the trial was an actual federal court judge (it was actually even held in his courtroom in the Federal Building, which I have to admit is one of the coolest modern building I've ever seen and REALLY nice on the inside). And I have to admit that I have never seen a trial before (I wasn't able to make one in DC), so it was a really good way for me to see the way they work and then hear critiques from the judge and other lawyers about the way the case was presented (and also really good for me to look at things through the eyes of a juror).  I busted it back from that so I could make my softball games that night.  I don't know what it's been lately, but it seems that virtually any night we've had v-ball or softball it's been relatively chilly.  We lost the first game to the other HCC team (but it was close all the way through), then we actually beat the best team in the league.  Of course, it's pretty funny that we won 4-3 (in a softball game!), but it was actually a really well-played game where we both played great defense (I even made a really nice catch in the OUTFIELD!).  After softball I got back and arranged to catch a movie with Ben, Amanda, and Eric.  We saw The Chronicles of Riddick, and I have to admit I didn't think it was that great of a movie.  First, I thought that they relied too much on the assumption that the viewer had already seen Pitch Black (which I had), and secondly, I'm just not really down with the whole neo-Roman futuristic look.  I mean, come on, in the future I don't think most fights are going to be with knives!  Anyway, it's been a pretty busy day and I'm gonna get some sleep.  Hopefully tomorrow will be ok...

						   Today was...well, it's been one of those days that's seemed to last forever, yet at the same time has just seemed to go by so fast.  Of course, I've still got a lot of today left to go :-P  I actually went to Spanish class this morning.  I feel kinda bad about it, but of the 8 Spanish classes we've had so far, I've only actually gone to 6 of them (an incredibly low percentage for myself).  But it's just so hard to get going sometimes; I really don't have any motivation to go (aside from the obvious fact that I have to pass the class to graduate), and it just seems to drag on so badly when I'm there.  So anyway, I called off the public defender's today and tried to work on Spanish homework / studying all day.  Needless to say, I was only partially successful (inasmuch as I still have about 4 hours of studying and homework to do tonight and it's already 10 pm).  So that's been frustrating.  We had the second week of playoffs for our volleyball team tonight.  Considering that our team ended up in 6th place out of 7 teams, we weren't even supposed to make it into the second round, but here we were.  And we actually were playing a team that we knew we could beat, so I (and most of the people on our team) were feeling pretty good about things.  But I don't know if we were all tense or what, but it just wasn't a very good night - we got beat in straight games, and I have to admit that I really didn't have my best night (and neither did anyone else for that matter).  Oh well, I suppose there's always next year.  And I got this strangely sentimental note with my fortune cookie tonight (Chicken Kung Pao from Pearl...yummmmm).  It said, "Someone from your past has returned to steal your heart."  Of course, I never put any faith in these kind of things (sometimes they're downright laughable (even if they are right sometimes)...like the one I got in DC that said, "Politically, you're an independent"), but sometimes they really can get you thinking about things.  And this one definitely got me thinking; it totally surprised me how quickly I knew who I wished that person was.  And then it surprised me how quickly I put the thought out of my mind, and how dejected I felt about it.  Anyway, I suppose that this is just a normal part of life...but it still sucks. :(

						   Well, today was Father's Day, which means that I spent some time with the fam.  The plan was for me to take my brothers (Dan, Paul, and Jimmy) to the Akron Air Show today, but before we could leave I had to help direct traffic at church.  One of the things I really like about helping direct traffic is that I get to be one of the first persons people see when they arrive.  Of course, the flip side of this is that I get to see people as they arrive, and something hit me today - for joy supposedly being one of the principal byproducts of the Christian faith, a lot of people didn't look too happy to get to church.  And then I wondered what I looked like (sometimes the hardest thing to see is your own expression) - I try to always be smiling and friendly, but is that actually the way it comes across?  And Lord knows I don't exactly have one of those bubbly personalities, so I have no idea what I look like to other people - sometimes when I feel like I'm smiling it comes across looking like a smirk or something else :(  Anyway, I got done parking and headed down to the show.  When we got there an F-117 (i.e. the Stealth fighter) was doing some flybys, so that was really cool.  Most of the rest of the show was older prop planes, which I'm not really into.  But it was kind of cool to see some of them - they even had a B-17 that flew around a couple of times.  And I'm having thoughts about the military again, only this time I'm thinking about the Army or Air Force Reserves - I don't know exactly why, but I just feel this longing to really back up what I say about America with some action, and this is the best way I can think of.  When we got back from the air show we were supposed to eat, but my sisters weren't back with the grill we were buying for my dad for Father's Day yet (although they swore that the hold-up was due to some incredible story they wouldn't tell us over the phone!).  So when they get back we unload the grill and show it to my dad and all, then my sisters told us how they got the grill for only $88 when it was actually supposed to be $188! (basically, they spoke with a couple of people, pointed out that the grill was under a $88 sign and not marked otherwise, and the management actually bought it)  The rest of the evening was basically sitting around and talking, a lot of it centering around my cousin (although I'm not going to get into that here and now) or our schedule for the next week.  Then I headed back home and picked up some things, then headed over to my aunt's house to house-sit tonight (I'm doing so all week).  And that was basically my day...I know this blog was boring, I promise to do better tomorrow!

						   I have to admit, I'm writing this blog now so I can procrastinate from doing Spanish.  As much as I might try to tell myself I need to have a good attitude about that class, I just plain hate it; languages just ain't my thing :P  And being in class for TWO hours every day doesn't make anything much easier...  Anyway, today went really well.  I made it through Spanish (that's probably the best that it gets), then headed home and changed into my "spiffy" clothes (i.e. suit, tie, etc.) for my interview up in Cleveland.  I actually made it up there in about 40 minutes, and I don't think that the traffic is going to be bad for when I come in during the day (of course, getting home around 5:00 could be another matter).  I met with Tom Martin, the head of the appeals division; my dad had introduced me to him a couple of months ago and we'd been playing phone-tag, so it was good to finally meet him :P  We went back and had a brief meeting where he went over what I would probably be doing (I'm basically going to be a glorified go-fer, but I have a funny feeling I'm going to end up doing a lot more than that), and I was introduced to a couple of the people in the office.  Then I tagged along with one of the women while she dropped off a couple of papers at the appeals division and prosecutor's office (I really should remember her name!), then I got the low-down on parking, etc.  I have to admit, it was really good to be back in the public defender's atmosphere again.  I don't know quite what it is about it, but I just really feel comfortable being around people who are in trouble like that now; maybe because I think that I kinda know how to help them.  But I have to say that I noticed the differences between Cleveland and DC even while I was sitting in the waiting room, especially in the racial makeup of the clients (there's actually some white clients!).    I actually already got my first assignment with them today (aside from knowing that I'll probably be delivering and picking up documents every day).  I find this hilariously funny, but one of the attorneys at PDS (Washington) had a witness for a case who works in the Lorain Correctional Facility, so he/she asked the CPD (Cleveland) to serve the subpoena.  Guess what?  Yep, they were going to serve the subpoena tomorrow, so Tom said that since I have experience with serving PDS subpoenas already, why don't I serve it?  (Actually, I have to say that serving subpoenas was one of the funner things we did in DC, although it was always more fun when it was a hostile witness, and this guy is not).  We also had our playoff volleyball games tonight.  I couldn't believe how well we played!  We played the same team that crushed us in our first three games, and you could really see how far we'd come.  We destroyed them in the first game, then we barely dropped the second one when we hit a dry spell and just couldn't hit the ball straight.  The last game was pretty competitive and we had some awesome points, so we really felt good about things (especially since we pulled it off and won the match!) :)  Now we have another playoff game next Wednesday (8:00), and we might even make it to the championship if we win that one (considering we came in sixth out of seven teams, this is big news!).

						   I just got back from the Switchfoot concert (it was a prelude to ALIVE), and I can't say how much of a blessing that group has been to me.  Maybe it's a little corny to admit it, but perhaps more than any group (Lifehouse being the other one) they've helped me through some hard times with their music and messages.  It's so weird to me how music and lyrics and all can come to symbolize something greater than the acoustic waves they're made up of, but that's the beauty of the mystical nature of so many things that we take for granted.  Anyway, the concert was totally awesome.  Because of all the rain the last couple of days Clay's Park (where the concert was) was really muddy, but that kinda made it cooler (some people came out of it looking like they just got done playing rugby :P).  And I have to admit that I was pretty emotionally dead when I got there; going to concerts alone is kinda hard for me (both because it's not as much fun as with other people and because I'm not the type of person who spontaneously talks to people - I think I only talked to two people the whole night, one of them being the guy who helped me park me car and the other being a woman who commented on my GCC shirt I was wearing).  And I'm not really into the whole ska thing (Supertones opened), so I mainly people-watched while they were performing.  I definitely think that Switchfoot puts on one of the best shows I've seen.  Unlike a lot of other Christian bands they don't get caught up in stupid banter on-stage or try to proseletize too much; they just get up there and let their music speak for itself, and they present it unadorned with any extra fashionings that might detract from it.  But they're also really passionate about their music, I would say right up there with Third Day and Jars of Clay, and that comes through, too.  Anyway, I think I'm going to go crash and get some sleep tonight.  Tomorrow could be a really busy day - I have Spanish in the morning, then I'm meeting with my contact at the Cleveland Public Defender's office (and his boss) to see what I could for them.  Hopefully everything will go well and I can start interning there soon!  Then it's back to Grandma's and off for our volleyball playoff games, then back home to do Spanish homework.  And who knows, maybe I'll hear from some of the companies I put in applications for night work?

						   I had my first Spanish class today...I have to say, I'm REALLY not looking forward to it.  The prof is German (what is it with me and foreign teachers? - first it's the African teaching Spanish, now a German!), and he seems like he's pretty hard-nosed about things (i.e. a lot of homework, reading, etc.), so I don't think I'm going to get any of the this-is-the-last-class-I-need-to-graduate breaks :P.  But I was surprised with how much of it came back; of course, it's only been five months since I took my last Spanish class and I wasn't very good with it to be begin with.  Aside from that, I've got an interesting dilemma for my summer internship.  Right now I've gotten offers to do an internship with the Cuyahoga County (Cleveland) Public Defender and the Akron Prosecutor's Offie.  Considering that I'm not sure which side of criminal law I'm going to go into, this is quite a bind, especially since Akron is closer and it would minimize my overhead costs (i.e. gas, etc.) to work there.  But on the other hand, I might be able to do a lot of the same stuff I did in DC for the Cleveland PD (i.e. crime scene investigation, witness testimonies, etc.), and that would be awesome! :)  So I'm going to just see how this all pans out...

						   I heard something at church last night (and again this morning) that reminds me of a theme I've become impressed with lately:  Do The Right Thing.  With all of the decisions coming up in my life I've come to realize that there's almost always too many variables to consider all of them, so all of our decisions really are just a simplification of our problem.  And I've been realizing more and more lately that all of my problems can be solved with the simple answer "Do The Right Thing."  A lot of people talk about how hard it is to determine what the right thing is, or how the right thing might not always be the same for every person.  And both of these are true.  But they are the exception to the rule; the vast majority of the deicisons in our life (especially the small ones that make up most of what we do) have a relatively blatant "right" action or reaction we ought to do.  Of course, the trouble is actually doing it; a lot of the time the right thing is a lot harder than the wrong thing or the right thing's next-best alternative, whether it be physical or emotional exertion or social rejection or whatever.  But I've also been realizing that the more you make the right choices in the little things, the easier it is to make the right decisions in the big things (and the more evident the right thing to do seems to be).  Like Dave said last night, God only wants us to be holy for the next 60 seconds...then the next 60 seconds...and so on and so forth.  And breaking things down like this has really been helping me; too often I try to have a universalist perspective on things and try to consider what will be the best for the most people, but I've been deciding recently that a lot of the time this perspective is simply wrong (quite simply, because what seems best for the greatest number of people isn't usually what actually is best for them).  And it's also just so much SIMPLER to distill right and wrong actions down into a set of maxims instead of always trying to figure out the right reaction based upon the circumstances.

						   I actually had a job this week; one of the temp agencies I'm working for had an opening with a company called Davey Resource Group (a division of Davey Tree) as a formatter and editor.  I have to admit, it was really nice to be back working again; it might seem nice to have time off and all, but after a while it gets really depressing and ambivalent.  And it was really nice that the folks there seemed to incorporate me very nicely (considering I was "only a temp"); by the second day I was there I was doing a lot of the same projects and responsibilities as the person I was sitting in for.  Of course, now that Spanish starts next week I'm without a job again.  Hopefully something will come up, but I'm thinking that if nothing does I might just try to do the internship with the Cleveland Public Defender.  I have to admit that since I got back from DC I've really missed the purposefulness that the internship with PDS had; I mean, what I was doing there really had an impact on people's lives, and I just don't want to go back to "pushing paper."  Of course, I'm feeling kind of down about things in general right now.  I think that Switchfoot had it right when they said it's all about "Life and Love and Why" - life is really nothing but the way we live, the way we love, and why we do so.  And right now I feel really empty.  I don't know if it's the fact that it's summer or having Jay and Melissa around all the time or just a phase, but I've been feeling really lonely lately.  But at the same time it just doesn't seem like I have any hope for things to turn around or change; I mean, it takes me so freaking long to get close to people, and I'm not very outgoing, and I just don't really see why anyone would care to like me right now.  I think that the way that I'm constantly looking for a purpose is a very good thing about me, but at the same time I think that it precludes me from seeing things in other healthy ways.  I guess the source of it all is that I just don't seem to have any joy in anything.  I see other people who have celebrations and fun because they're graduating from college and all (and people who did so WHILE they were in college), and I'm just not like that.  I mean, there just isn't that kind of joy about it in me; college was one task, and now it's time to move on to the next.  And that's pretty much the way things are for me, both in the miniscule and the general; life is nothing but going from task to task, and if I don't have a task or a goal then life ceases to have meaning.  And that just seems so empty, maybe even nihilistic.  The saying "Stop and smell the roses" comes to mind.  I mean, if you think about it, how many flowers do we pass by on the road every day and are just going too fast to even be able to get a whiff of the fragrance they emit?  And that's the way it seems like my life is right now; in some area it seems like things are moving so slowly (especially the social realms), but in general it seems like I'm hurtling along a set of railroad tracks about ready to enter a tunnel - I can already see the light at the other end, but I have no idea what that light illuminates.  And I'm wondering if maybe I shouldn't stop the train for a while and just walk, to take time to enjoy life instead of hurtling by everything.  Of course, that sounds wonderful, but I don't even know if I could do it if I tried.  As horrible as this might sound, if I tried to slow things down I bet I would only get frustrated and depressed - I'm not going to change who or how I am in any brief period of time, and the frustration of trying to do so would be so painful that I don't know if it's worth it.  Maybe this is just the way I'm supposed to be; one of the things that I've realized is that there are just different types of people in the world, and maybe I'm simply getting discontent because I'm wishing I was someone that I'm not.  But on the other hand, maybe this is something that I know I need and I'm just afraid of failing to reach it.  Anyway, it just seems like things are kinda blaise right now.  And I don't know why - as has been the case so many times in my life, if I were to look at things objectively (i.e. "on the face of things") I don't really have any reason to be so down: I have a full-ride scholarship to law school, I don't have so many economic pressures that being without a job for a while is going to put me in any sort of financial disaster, I have a proximate and relatively caring family (both close and extended), I am involved in quite a few "community activities" (church, basketball, softball, volleyball, etc.), I'm graduating from college summa cum laude (whatever grade I get in my summer class isn't going to affect my GPA), and it would probably appear on the outside that I'm not in any sort of emotional or physical distress.  But all of that is objective, and one of the things I've been learning over the last couple of years is that the "objective" view of things is very often not as objective as it claims to be.  So relatively speaking from my own point of view, it seems like my life is going nowhere right now.  One of the things that I like to say is that I'm a relational person, but this is absolutely not true; relationships might motivate me (even highly superficial ones), but in reality I have so few real relationships that I hardly remember what one is (and the memories of it/them are something I try to avoid because they only accentuate my current perception of loneliness).  And I don't know whether this is my fault or a byproduct of my past or just the way things are; probably a little of all these.  But I know that the end result is that I don't have any relationships and I don't know how to get any, and the sum of this is the feeling that I'm pretty much destined to be alone.  And it also scares me to think of what might happen if I do develop a relationship - I mean, I don't know how to "hold up my end of the deal," which inevitably ends up with whatever relationships I have falling apart (or simply dissolving).  So it's really a lose-lose-lose situation; I don't feel that I'm very appealing to be in a relationship with, I don't feel able to begin a relationship myself, and I'm scared that whatever relationship I might develop will invariably not last.  Wow, I am SUCH an optimist :P  Of course, I wonder why I even write this stuff on here at all; I doubt that anyone even reads it, and I'm sure that if anyone is and they've gotten to this point of this blog they're wondering why I'm such a prick.  I guess I put it on here because it's somewhat cathartic; I don't have anyone to talk to about these things in real life, and I've been holding things in for my entire life and that hasn't gotten anything any better, so maybe it's just a defense mechanism to keep from getting too bitter about things (it's better to be melancholy than mean, right?).  So I guess this blog is my own pseudo-shrink; after all, isn't basically what shrinks do is sit there and listen?  So what better than to talk to everyone and no one at the same time?

						   Work was ok today...I got complemented for how well I was doing on one of the proposals I was working on, but most of the day was spent affixing address labels to envelopes.  Yeah, if I EVER see another Avery label it will be TOO SOON; by my count I put on over 1500 labels today (and my fingers are raw).  But I've been told that there's going to be a rush proposal they want me to work on tomorrow morning, so that should be fun :)  I also got in my Swedes today.  For all of you non-competitive swimmers, Swedes (i.e. Swedish goggles) are goggles without any foam, plastic, rubber, etc. around the eyepieces; they're about as basic as you can get.  I loved them when I used to swim competitively, and now I remember why - they are SO MUCH FUN.  I guess you'd have to plug into the "swimming culture" to really get it, but the gyst of it is that you can flip them at people easily (always a plus - almost as good as having a towel that snaps really well ;), the extra strap is great for chewing on, and you can adjust them so that they fit your face perfectly by replacing the string nosepiece they give you with a rubber one off the strap on the back.  And they're CHEAP (one pair was $3.95).  Oh, and I get great visibility out of them... (Yes, I CAN get excited over seemingly nothing...)

						   I heard that former President Reagan died while I was working out today.  Normally I give passing celebrities hardly a passing glance; their impacts upon my life are usually relatively miniscule, and the impact of their passing will be even less so.  But I found myself really feeling sorry for President Reagan's death; perhaps its somewhat my own childhood sentiment, but in many ways Reagan stood for the good things in America.  During his presidency America was relatively united both internally and, as such, presented a united front in a period of extreme political tension and potential horrific disaster.  And I think a lot of it was just the way that he brough people together through his positive attitude; few politicians emanate the genuine aura of goodwill and optimism that he did, and for that reason the world is less for his passing.

						   Today was pretty much totally uneventful.  I woke up really late b/c my sleep schedule is ALL messed up and I'm not usually getting to bed until 2 or 3 in the morning; this is going to have to change before I start my job on Monday (at 8 AM!).  Then I decided I wasn't going to trim the bushes because it looked like it was going to rain and it was cold out (it stayed cold out all day, but it didn't rain).  So I decided to TRY to do something useful and learn how to make up a table of contents in Word and manipulate things in it (ok, so maybe it wasn't TOTALLY due to abstract self-betterment; I need to know how to do it for my job Monday), but I can't find anyplace that has a tutorial on it!  The Net didn't have anything, Stow library didn't have anything, and neither did KSU's library!  So there went a wasted three hours looking for that.  So maybe the only "good" thing that happened all day was my workout.  I have to admit, I've always been one of those kinds of people who hated to work out; I mean, what's the point it making yourself sweaty, tired, and sore when you don't have a purpose to it (i.e. not playing a sport, working in a heavy-lifting job, etc.)?  But I think that my perspective might be changing; since I stopped playing baseball three years ago I've pretty much "let myself go," and now I'm really self-conscious.  So I finally decided when I got back from DC that it's time to do something about it, so now I'm on Atkins and working out 5 days a week.  And I'm swimming again (which feels great!) - today I swam 1100 yards, so I think I'm simply going to try to up my yardage by 100 yards every day I swim until I'm finally up to a mile (which is only 1600 yards, so I'm not very far away).  Then I just need to start building up some stamina; I never was a distance swimmer (I swam the sprint events when I did it competitively, never really swimming anything over 100 yards); right now I can barely do 100 yards before I have to stop and rest.  OK, so I'm sure I've totally bored everyone (but if anyone wants to "talk shop" about swimming, drop me a line!).  Oh, and I ran into one of my former professors while I was at the pool; she had been reading my DC blog while I was away, and she was telling me how much she liked it and everything.  For some reason she thought I "gave her hope in your generation," so I didn't have the heart to tell her that I hold virtually the opposite perspective then her on her primary issue (direct democracy - she loves it, I think that it's best to have most decision-making power with a few).  Anyway...on the more philosophic side of things, I'm feeling acutely alone lately.  It seems that everyone has girlfriends or boyfriends or just good close friends, and as usual I'm on the outside looking in.  And maybe the worst thing is that I just don't think I'm dating material; like I said before, I'm self-conscious, and besides that I'm not particularly engaging, witty, or kind, so I don't really have anything to "offer."  And on top of that, I'm not even participating in any of the type of activities where one usually finds anyone, so my social life is pretty dismal right now.  So that's one big downer right now; I keep seeing other people (and listening to country music) and remember all the feelings and great things about being with someone, and it just feels like there's a huge hole inside me.

						   I actually got back into the water and did some lap-swimming today.  For anyone reading this, you have to understand that this was a momentous occassion for me - I used to be a VERY competitive swimmer (near nationals-level), but then I dropped out of swimming midway through high school b/c CVCA didn't have a team.  And I haven't gotten back into the water to do any competitive swimming since then, so it was so weird to actually get back in and give it a try.  But it was amazing how quickly things came back to me - I guess it's kind of like riding a bike, you never really forget how.  Of course, I only got in about a 1,000 yards in a half-hour, my knee is all swelled up because I'm not used to doing breaststroke kick, I couldn't swim more than 100 yards at a time (but in fairness, I had lifted and biked 6 miles before I got in), and I could only swim a 50 in 40 seconds, so it was a far cry from what I used to be able to do.   But at the same time, it was great to just get back in and I'm sure I can get things back to being somewhat respectable (I even went out and ordered two pairs of Swedes today :)

						   I think I'm definitely going through a transformation of sorts.  One of the things I've always thought about myself (if not necessarily always exhibiting it) was that I was basically from the country (i.e. rural) at heart, but lately it's become a dominant theme.  For instance, I pretty much only listen to country music any more; it's gone so far that two of the songs on my rotation are "Redneck Woman" and "It's OK to be a Redneck", I know where Rascal Flatts, Keith Urban, and Shania Twain are all from (Ohio, Australia, and Canada, respectively), and I even found myself watching the CMA awards on TV the other day.  But it's gone a lot farther than just the music - I've been saying "y'all" and "howdy" for a while now, but now it's progressing into the tone and manner of my speech.  I used to interject all kinds of "big words" into my conversations, but anymore my main goal has simply to come across as friendly and laid-back (which generally means using "small words").  And I've been finding myself more and more drawn to the out-of-doors lately.  I went out and visited my aunt and uncle in rural Virginia on my way home from DC, and I have to say that I felt more comfortable out there than I've felt in a long time.  Maybe it's weird to some people, but the smells and the openess and everything just appeal to me in a way that the city and suburbs never could.  Maybe the heart of all of this is an attempt on my part to get in touch with the simpler parts of myself, to reach back and revive the way I was back when we lived in the country before we moved up to Hudson.  And I think that the two things I'm trying to realize most are a simplified worldview where the most important consideration in anything I do is whether it's right or not and a straight-forward perspective on things where I feel free to speak my mind.  Of course, if I remember correctly this way I was didn't exactly get me a whole lot of friends (although it probably was about the same number as I have now), but at least I felt at peace with myself.

						   I went to my sister Katie's graduation tonight.  I never quite realized how LONG it can take to get through 443 names (yeah, Hudson has a big graduating class :P).  And just ONCE I would love to see one of the presenters (either faculty or student) get up and say something like, "Hey y'all, it's been great, I love all of you, be careful on the way home."  You know, short and sweet.  But NO, everyone thinks this is their opportunity to share their wisdom and sentiments with all these people; I have to admit, all of the student presentations were pretty good, but I think that all of the graduation speakers must have some secret web site they all download their speeches from (they all say the same thing!).  But it was cool to see Katie graduating.  It was weird when EB graduated (I felt so OLD), but now I think I've come to terms with the whole "getting old thing" and it's not so startling.  Of course, that doesn't mean that I'm accepting EVERY aspect of it, but at the same time I realize it's only natural that friends are going to get married, brothers and sisters are going to graduate, etc. etc. etc.  But it'll probably be something else when one of my brothers or sisters gets married (which will probably be before I do :P).  The rest of my day was ok.  I heard back from one of the temp agencies and a landscaping place that I interviewed with yesterday - the landscaping place said that they reevaluated their demand and decided they didn't need anyone right now, but the temp agency said that they had a job I could work next week, so that's definitely a step in the right direction.  I also finally dragged my butt into the gym today.  Rode five and a half miles on the stationary, then lifted weights, then went and swam some - it was a good start.  Of course, I would have swam more except the suit I bought the other day was too large and I had to be careful not to swim too fast and swim right out of it =D.  And then I went and played our v-ball games tonight (they didn't go so well, but we had two subs tonight), so that was fun :)  Of course, the real test will be how I feel tomorrow morning; after I lifted on Friday I hurt like crazy all weekend, but I think that b-ball in the morning and getting into the gym early (and a lot of Ibuprofen) should be able to forestall most aches and pains.

						   I think I've determined why I've been having such a hard time lately:  bad luck.  First it's the not-finding-a-job thing (it's been a month since I got back from DC now), then I was playing euchre last night and I just couldn't get ANYTHING to come out right, and then I was playing basketball this morning and my team couldn't score any points (until I sat a game out, then they hit three consecutive 3-pointers).  I'm cursed!  OK, probably not, but it's all very puzzling...I just need to figure out how to turn things around...  At least all this "time off" has given me some time to work on things around Grandma's house.  I just finished painting the ceiling of my room (which was a real pain because it has acoustic tiles and you have to hand-paint between each one), so now I'm going to start working on Jay's ceiling.  And the yard doesn't look like a jungle ;)  I've got to call back a bunch of the law offices that I sent resumes to today - I'm definitely not looking forward to it.  I HATE cold-calling and calling about myself; I guess the only consolation is that they don't know me from jack right now, and I might never run into them again down the road (and if I do they probably won't remember me)...

						   I think that I need to apologize for all those times I complained about DC driving - after experiencing Cleveland driving over the last couple of weeks, I definitely have to say that it's MUCH worse.&nbsp; For some reason people around here, when in large groups of cars, feel an urgent need to slow down to 5-10 BELOW the speed limit, thus meaning that those behind them have to slow down even further!&nbsp; I mean, there is absolutely NO reason (accidents and whatnot aside) why traffic should ever come to a standstill on a major highway!&nbsp; And perhaps the worst thing is that it's not usually one of those gradual slow-downs where you have time to see everyone stopping and ease into it.&nbsp; NO, around here everyone has to brake at the LAST second, meaning that I have to do likewise (which is a little bit trickier with my manual transmission, especially if I want to get going again quickly).  But the thing that is getting on my nerves MOST about Cleveland driving (although it's something I'm getting used to) is the way that all the major highways up around Cleveland seem to drive absolutely backward.&nbsp; I mean, most of the time the SLOW people are in the far-right hand lane and the FAST people (like me) are in the far-left hand lane.&nbsp; Nope, not around here.&nbsp; In fact, the right-hand lane is often the SLOWEST lane, whereas the left-hand lane is actually moving along the quickest.&nbsp; Now this is usually due to the fact that the left-hand lane turns into an exit somewhere down the road, necessitating a frantic merge back into the "middle" lane, but it's definitely NOT the way I was taught to drive!  Anyway, aside from all this complaining, I think that I found an awesome drive on my way back from work.&nbsp; Normally I take 77-480-271-8 on the way back, but the last couple of days I've been taking 77-271 and then a bunch of back roads.&nbsp; The back roads go through the Valley, so all the curves and hills are a lot of fun (personal rule:&nbsp; take curves 15-20 mph faster than the "recommended" speed ;).&nbsp; And the best part is that it only takes me about 5-10 minutes longer than the "usual" way (assuming that traffic on 77 isn't too bad).

						   Goodness, I have a lot of catching up to do on here.&nbsp; I would love to say that my reticense in doing so is due to how horribly busy I've been, but saying that would just be lying :P&nbsp; No, the fact is I just haven't done it...  &nbsp;  ANYWAY...the big news of late is that I'm GRADUATED!!&nbsp; Yep, somehow I passed Spanish (heck, I got a B!!), so I'm finally finished with KSU.&nbsp; I have to admit that I didn't have such hostile feelings towards the place until this last semester, but I suppose all will be forgiven once law school starts and college seems like such a pleasant memory :P&nbsp; I'm actually thinking about going to graduation now; I wasn't planning on going, but John (my boss) told me that I should reconsider since it probably means more to other people than to me.&nbsp; So we'll see (although I'm still leaning towards no - I mean, this isn't my LAST graduation ;).  &nbsp;  Speaking of law school, I got my schedule and all from CSU today.&nbsp; I think my schedule looks pretty favorable; I don't have to be at class until 2:45 Monday, and I'm done with classes at 11:10 on Friday, so I really like it.&nbsp; Of course, the main thing is the teachers I'm going to&nbsp;have, so I'm going to run some names by a couple of people who have been at CSU.&nbsp; And I've heard that the first year of law school is the "weeding out" period and is hard as anything, so I'm not really looking forward to that.&nbsp; I've been reading a book called "One-L" by a guy who was in his first year of law school at Harvard, and after reading it I'm kind of looking forward to and kind of dreading law school.&nbsp; I think I'm going to like the fact that we're only studying ONE topic and the general competitiveness of the classes, but I also know I'm probably going to hate the pressure to study and do well and the one-exam-for-your-grade method.   I was talking to my cousin today and told him that I was looking forward to DOING law, but not so much studying it.&nbsp; The experience I'm having with CPD and with PDS gave me a real taste of what&nbsp;it means to DO law and actually have clients, real people, relying on you.&nbsp; But I also know that I'm not looking forward to three more years of studying; the whole studying thing started to get old for me my junior year of high school, and time hasn't exactly tempered my opinion in this regard.   I also helped do some roofing today.&nbsp; A single-mom in our church needed a new roof, so a bunch of us volunteered to help take off her old one and put on the new.&nbsp; Of course, I didn't realize that we were going to start at 7 AM!!&nbsp; But I dragged myself out of bed and got there by 7:30.&nbsp; Taking off the roof was a real bear - there were two or three layers of roofing, and every time we tried to take a layer off our shovels caught on some nails and we had to pry them out.&nbsp; So that took about three hours and left me with two really painful blisters :(  Then we started putting the new roof on.&nbsp; Fortunately, we had three or four guys there who either do roofing as their jobs or used to do roofing, so they knew how to do all of the "technical stuff."&nbsp; And we got three nail-guns goin (that's what I did all day :D), so things were moving pretty smoothly.&nbsp; Still, even with experienced people doing things and three nail-guns goin, we didn't get "finished" (we ran out of shingles) until about 5:30, by which time I had been thoroughly cooked and was ready to be turned inside-out like the lobster I felt like.&nbsp; But despite all the hard work it took and all I've really been looking for things like this to do, so it was really great to be able to get out and do something.  Speaking of work, things have been going well there.&nbsp; I spent a couple of days last week helping move John's stuff from his old office to his new one; to say that this was a HUGE undertaking is a vast understatement.&nbsp; I swear that I have never seen an office more chaotic and disorderly than his; when you walk in there  literally  isn't anyplace to stand, not to mention sit (there are two chairs / paper stacks).&nbsp; So basically what I did was go in, get a paper-box full of papers from his old office, take them into his new office, sort them, file them (if possible), then repeat the process.&nbsp; To say it was tedious would be a slight understatement, but I didn't mind doing it simply because it gave me something to do (sometimes it seems like I'm a person with a job but nothing to do).   But I've also been doing some other miscellaneous tasks lately, a couple of which have been really interesting and informative.&nbsp; One of the things that I noticed while I was going through John's cases was a new Supreme Court decision called  Blakely ; I had heard a couple of people talking about it in the office, so I took the opportunity to read most of it.&nbsp; Basically,  Blakely  holds that a judge doesn't have the right to add more than the maximum sentence on a defendant convicted of a crime, even if a state law allows him to, if the jury does not also believe that such a sentence if appropriate beyond a reasonable doubt.   Anyway, the immediate significance of  Blakely  (for me) is that John called me in the middle of last Friday afternoon and asked me to go down to a judge's courtroom and take notes on a sentencing proceeding that he may have a  Blakely  objection to.&nbsp; So I went down, but it seemed like things were a little confusing - the judge actually kept jumping back and forth between two or three cases, none of which was a sentencing hearing.&nbsp; Finally, when I was about to leave, the sentencing proceeding finally started.&nbsp; While I was pretty well-prepared for the note-taking and reporting part, I wasn't at all prepared for the way the proceeding was going to affect me emotionally, etc.   The case I was viewing was for a 21-year-old Latino guy who had been convicted of attempted murder for arranging a hit on a girl who was accusing him of rape (the hit never went through and the girl ended up being fine).&nbsp; The prosecutor went first; in my opinion it seemed like the judge already had his mind made up about the sentencing by the way it seemed he led the prosecutor in his arguments.&nbsp; Basically, Ohio law allows a sentence greater than the maximum proscribed by law if the crime is one of the worst forms of an offense or if the convict poses a clear threat for committing the crime again.&nbsp; The prosecutor / judge argued that he fell under both (he had a number of other offenses pending as well, from narcotics to pimping to auto theft).&nbsp; The defense lawyer got up and naturally tried to argue against the maximum penalty, but it just seemed like everything was stacked against him.   After the defense lawyer finished the guy who committed the crimes got up and spoke.&nbsp; I will never claim to be a great criminal psychologist, but it was especially hard to read this guy - he said all the "usual" things about being really sorry about what he had done and all, but it was hard to tell whether he was being insincere or if the whole proceeding was kind of overwhelming him.   Then his mother got up to speak.&nbsp; I must say that I have never seen a woman who looked more as if life had simply beaten her and she was done fighting - her demeanor communicated a sense of great sorrow, of a heart heavy from all the wrongs committed against her, and she simply knew she was doing nothing but playing out whatever string of life she may have left.&nbsp; She stopped briefly to speak with her son, something I got the feeling she hadn't had the opportunity to do in a long time.&nbsp; From her I found out a lot of other things about this guy - he had been in and out of foster homes since he was 4, in and out of prison since he was 18, and his father had been convicted of rape and murder and had been abusive at home.   By this time I was starting to feel really heartbroken about the whole thing.&nbsp; I know that what this guy had done wasn't ok by any stretch of the imagination, but it just didn't seem like anyone had EVER been there for him, not even in the smallest of ways the rest of us normally take for granted.&nbsp; And then the judge handed down the maximum plus extra time (it all added up to 11.5 years), and it just seemed like everything fell apart for me.&nbsp; I rationally knew that it was probably the right penalty by law, but it reimpressed upon me the way in which our criminal "justice" system is more bent upon punishment than rehabilitation.&nbsp; The mother hardly even reacted at first - I think that for her it was crushing, but in a way similar to any number of other events in her life.&nbsp; I think that she eventually started to weep, but her posture didn't change throughout the whole thing, but that was only because she had come in with the same sorrowful and defeated sense that one typically only sees once a negative verdict or sentence has been passed down.   While the guy being sentenced hadn't showed a whole lot of emotion throughout the whole proceeding, after everything was over he turned around and I could see that his eyes were really red.&nbsp; His mother asked the bailiff if she could speak with him and he said no, that he had to be taken down right away for processing.&nbsp; Now I KNOW that maybe that's technically true, but I also know that the guard was simply being hard about things, that he could have shown a little compassion and let the woman speak with her son (who she may not see again for a long time).   But two things really hit me hard about the whole thing.&nbsp; Number one was how easy it would have been for me to be in that chair and for him to be sitting where I was; he and I were nearly the same age, but for some reason he had been born into a poorer and abusive home and I had been born into a home where things were provided.&nbsp; Of course, being thankful for what I had been given was a natural response to this realization, but it was heavily tempered by an underlying sense that it all seemed so unfair, that there was no joy to be taken from what had just happened.  The second thing that hit me was simply how this whole life-changing event for this guy had happened and there were only six of us in the courtroom at the time.&nbsp; No one, aside from his mother and perhaps myself and maybe the defense lawyer, felt a profound sense of sorrow for what had happened to this kid and what he had done, and no one really cared.&nbsp; In fact, virtually no one even knew that this guy had been&nbsp;convicted or sentenced.&nbsp; And we were in the 21st floor of the Justice Center, in one of four courtrooms, so I just wonder how often other people have their lives destroyed in a similar way and no one even knows about it.  Fast forward to yesterday (Friday).&nbsp; About halfway through the afternoon John comes in and asks me if I want to go with him to a meeting with a judge;  of course  I agree to go.&nbsp; On the way there he also lets me know that he's actually going over to have a "cup of coffee" with a Yale law-school student (who are like GODS in the law-school-student circles), so by the time we get up to the meeting I'm feeling a little intimidated (a Yalie AND a judge?!).&nbsp; The Yale guy looked exactly like the prototypical Northeasterner stereotype people usually think of Yale Law School kids looking like - you know, more like&nbsp;a high-level executive perfectly at ease when hanging out people in positions of power.&nbsp; Very different than the farmer or blue-collar types I typically associate myself with.  Anyway, the judge we were meeting with was the same one who was presiding over the sentencing hearing I went to the week before; also in attendance was an appeals prosecutor (who actually was a very young woman).&nbsp; The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the implications of Blakely, so I didn't feel totally lost.&nbsp; But I couldn't believe how seemingly effortlessly they were thowing around cases and definitions and terms and rules; maybe it's knowledge by familiarity, but it was still really impressive.&nbsp; I thought that the judge was actually pretty personable and not overly pompous, and it was really neat for me to be able to sit in on a meeting that I thought might actually have long-term consequences.  Then I went home and we won our two softball games - WOOHOO! :)

						   After another ELECTRIFYING morning of Spanish (we went over "si" clauses!) I headed up for my first PAID day of work with the public defender.  I really had no idea what to expect, so it was a little like still being a volunteer (I did the filing run, etc.).  And I had to do a lot of exactly what I HATE to do most (i.e. waiting around and doing nothing) - sometimes I feel like a puppy when I get like that, where I walk around and investigate everything, then feel like laying down and going to sleep after I run out of things to do (which doesn't take very long).  Anyway, I finally started getting a feel for some of what I'm going to be doing towards the end of the day.  One of the really cool things is that I'll probably be asked to stand in on arraignments (where the client gets charged and a lawyer gets assigned) and do expungments, both things that will get me really involved with our clients (which is great!).  Aside from that, I'm still pretty much in the dark - I don't even know if they're going to be able to find me an office or cubicle with a computer and a phone! :(

						   Well, since the weekend is pretty close to being over, I might as well update this thing.  Friday night went really well - we had a tripe-header for my softball team, and we actually won all three games and played REALLY well (the last game in particular).  I don't know what it is, but I've been having an inclination to go to a lot of Indians game lately, so I almost went up to the one on Friday - and man don't I wish I had now!  So anyway, that was basically Friday night (I know, not particularly exciting, but c'est la vie).  I woke up with all kinds of great plans for Saturday, including getting some Spanish homework done, but by the end of the day my grand plans had been decimated to being content with mowing the lawn and making a Wal-Mart run.  I once again was planning on going to the Indians game, but everyone bailed on me so I ditched that idea (which I'm really glad I did now - they got crushed).  I had parking at church today.  Parking is really easy - we actually have a traffic pattern for our parking lot (since it's set up really crazy), so we basically just stand out there and point to where people need to go or park (or hold up traffic so people can get out of their spaces and leave).  And it's kind of hard to miss us (and especially me) since we wear those orange vests you see construction works with).  Anyway, so I point out where this one guy needs to go and I KNOW he sees me, but his wife is sitting there pointing at another spot; sure enough, he goes where she points.  We all got a pretty good laugh analyzing that one later on (someone succinctly pointed out that he has to live with her every day, whereas he only has to deal with me once a month!). :P  As sad as it might seem, I actually feel like I accomplished something today simply because I washed my car.  Like most guys (at least, most guys I know) I don't necessarily keep up with cleaning all the time, and cleaning (and washing) my car is no exception.  So today I actually took the time to do some automotive clean-up (inside and outside) and do some amateur detailing (tire black, highlighting black strips, waxing everything, etc.).  So my car looks nice and spiffy now :D  Now I just need to do something about the engine...  OK, enough procrastinating...now I need to go do some Spanish :(  We might play v-ball tonight, so hopefully the weather cooperates :)

						   I hate this...I hate being so negative, hate feeling so pessimistic, hate feeling so trapped, hate complaining, hate getting down on myself.  But I guess that it happens to all of us sometimes, and while most people actually vent these feelings to other people when they come up - well, I pretty much just talk to myself and jettison them into cyberspace (i.e. write them here).  You know, I've come to realize in the last couple of days that I really have nothing that I admire about myself, nothing that if someone came up to me and asked, "What are you especially good at or what quality do you think you're especially strong in?", I could give them an honest answer and feel that I actually was strong in that area.  I daresay that anyone has ever described me as "fun" or "outgoing," least of all myself.  I'm hardly handsome or dashing, especially lately.  I'm certainly not a sociable person or someone who even makes decent conversation.  I'm not really all that bright (something becoming more and more clear to me), and what I think I do know I usually don't.  I'm not especially caring or loving, don't have a significant amount of empathy or selfless concern.  I'm not very attentive or outgoing.  I'm certainly not very wise or discerning, at least not in ways that are practically useful, and I can never seem to find the right thing to say at the right time.  I'm not really very eloquent, don't seem to be able to fully grasp what people are saying all the time, and I'm not really a very good listener.  I don't make friends easily, don't take charge of situations very often (and I don't lead very well), don't plan things well when I do think of something, and don't tend to be the best follower, either.  I'm not an especially hard worker, don't think of the most efficient ways of doing things, and am not especially strong in my morals, beliefs, or convictions (what few there may be).  And I'm not confrontational in the least, so whatever "beliefs" or "convictions" I might have are solely my own and not something that I would ever share with anyone (which makes for a very frustrating worldview).    So I guess things are looking (and feeling) a little bleak right now.  Some people might say that there isn't anywhere to go but up, but those people have never gotten in a position where there doesn't really seem to be any motivation to do so.  I guess the best summary of things is that I'm miserable and wallowing in it; I know that the right thing to do is to snap out of this and try to change things, but I just don't seem to have the heart, interest, or energy to do so right now.  Call me defeatist, depressing, or just a downright loser, but that's the way things seem right now.  I mean, what do I have to look forward to?  Law school?  From what I've heard, it ain't exactly one big party.  So what else?  Sad as it might seem, nothing else comes to mind - I don't really have any close friends (daresay a "significant other!"), don't have any significant projects or hobbies to distract me, don't have a job that I can try to bury all of this by working a lot.  I've heard that some people become "gym rats" and just work out all the time - that's an option, but I've never really gotten into the whole working-out thing (even when I was playing sports).  And besides, I know in the long run none of these things will dull this void in my spirit or emotions or id or whatever you want to call it, the void created by a lacking of people and beliefs in my life.  One of the things that I've always believed is that people and relationships are the most important things in life, but my utter paucity of them feels like a crushing condemnation of my own hypocrisy.  Right now my mind, my emotions, and my spirit are all crying out for something, for a real touch from someone or something, for someone to tell me or for me to realize that I actually matter in the grand scheme of things, but I have no idea where any of that is going to come from...

						   Where to start on this one...?  I guess the biggest news lately is that I've been offered a job with the Cuyahoga County Public Defender.  Heck, they're even going to pay me ($10/hr.!), so that's gravy; I was thinking about going back there for free once my temp job was over, so this is awesome! :)  Ever since I got back from DC I've had the "criminal law itch" where I've wanted to get back into the "action" so much, so I'm really looking forward to this.  And it sounds like they're going to give me some real responsibilities as part of my position, so I could get some really relevant experience here.  Of course, I have to finish up my temping position first; at the end of last week Superior called and said that Davey wanted me to come back for a while, so I jumped at that (I can use the money!).  But I'm done there next Tuesday; as soon as I get the final word from CCPD I'm going to call up Superior and break the news (which hopefully is sooner rather than later - I hate inconveniencing people like this).  But it is nice to know that DRG requested me; evidently they'd tried some other people and it just didn't work out, so they asked for me :)  But the circumstances aren't what I would like - the woman I'm subbing for could be out for a really long time because they found out that she has ovarian cancer (they only found out after they operated on her for breast cancer), so if y'all think of it, offer up a prayer for her.  Aside from work I've been finding various odds and ends to keep my "busy."  Spanish is still SUCH a drag on me, and I'm starting to feel really bad about my attitude and effort towards it.  On the one hand, don't I have a right to be a little pissed off that I have to take an (expensive!) class in a subject that I'm not good at all in and which doesn't apply to my career?!  But on the other I know that I should still be able to knuckle down and do my best, but I just don't have any motivation to do anything for the class right now (I'm only handing in 50% of my homework and attending about 75% of the classes, plus I'm not doing any class prep).  Hopefully it won't come around and bite me in the butt - I've done ok on the first two exams, but my homework and participation grades could be pretty low and I have no idea how I did on the exam today (ok, actually, I think I failed, but I've been wrong about that before).  Anyway, since I'm not doing Spanish with my free time I've been finding other things to do.  It's been absolutely beautiful around here lately, so I've had an opportunity to get some work done on the lawn and all (and get a nice tan in the process :).  And Paul and Jimmy helped me wash the cars the other day (Grandma and mine).  Unfortunately I haven't had the motivation to do much exercising lately (my mom would kill me if she found out), but that could change now that I might have some motivation...  I spoke with a National Guard recruiter tonight and he's sending me some more information on signing up.  My mom and dad probably think that I'm totally crazy, but I am really serious about signing up for this; I've always had the greatest respect for military personnel, especially with the events of late, and I would really like to do my part for what I consider to be the greater good and instill some self-discipline in myself.  And equally important to me is simply the opportunity to DO something; I'm so afraid that I'm going to just get stuck behind a desk and not be able to do any "legwork" for my job (whatever it might end up being), so this would be my chance to get out and do something with my hands.  Oh, and then there's the loan repayment they're offering (up to $10,000), but I can honestly say that money isn't a motivation for me in this at all - my motives are purely DOING something that I think is right, and since I know that I can't enlist in the military and still have my career, this is the next best option.  Plus, it's the National Guard, not the "regular Army," so they do a lot of civil work, too, and that appeals to me.  I made it up to an Indians game Monday night; unfortunately, the Indians lost, but I definitely found the best way to take in a game.  One of the things that I found out last year are that there are some $5 seats at the Jake way up in the farthest reaches of the nosebleeds, so it's a relatively simply matter to get in for a very cheap price.  And then I can get some of the best "seats" in the stadium if I just go down and stand on the Home Run Porch for the whole game!  So I definitely think that I'm going to have to do this a couple more times this summer; I took Eric Robinson, Paul, and Jimmy to the game and it only cost me $5 parking and $20 for tickets, and that's definitely something I can put up with!  And they even had a really great fireworks display afterwards (in fact, we were so close that pieces of paper from the fireworks was showering down on us and I was all sooty by the end of the display), so that was a great bonus.  So anyone who wants to catch an Indians game when you're in town (or anytime), just let me know!  Speaking of Indians games, I can't believe that I actually had to turn down BOX seats to the game last night.  See, Andy got them from a friend of his and invited me to go, but I had already committed to doing video for a program at church last night (not to mention that I had to study for my Spanish exam, but that was a SMALL consideration ;).  So that was kind of a bummer, especially since the video was HECTIC (they didn't have the words for half of the songs, so I had to manually input the lyrics, and then I hadn't heard half of the songs and they didn't give me a lyrics roll, so I basically had to do the video "by ear").  OH!!!  And I actually got pulled over for the first time on my way back from the Indians game.  This being the 4th of July weekend and all the cops were out in force, and I have to admit that I tend to drive a LITTLE fast (ok, a lot fast, depending on who you ask).  But normally I'm really careful to keep an eye out for cops, but I guess that I was a little tired last night and just missed him (and I was going a little faster than I thought I was).  Regardless, I flew past him and knew I was dead, especially when he pulled out behind me; however, he didn't put on his lights right away, so I thought that maybe he would let me get away with it (since I had slowed down right away and all).  But nope, as soon as I pulled over into the right-hand land the lights came on and I was screwed.  I don't know if he was having a really good day or what, but he simply came up and asked me for my license (while Eric frantically looks through the glove box for the insurance and registration) and asked if I had any prior tickets (thankfully, NO I DON'T!).  Then he told me that I had been going 79 mph (I didn't know I'd been goin THAT fast, especially since it's a 60 mph zone), but told me not to bother with finding the insurance and whatnot and headed back to his cruiser.  And when he came back he just handed me my license and said he was going to give me a warning!  God bless Macedonia cops...I would have been SO screwed if I would have been another 1/2 mile down the road in Boston Heights.  Speaking of tickets, that seems to have been a popular topic lately; Andy got a ticket (and subsequently a radar detector), and I actually saw THREE cars pulled over by three separate cops on I-77 within a half-mile of each other the other day when I dropped EB off at the Akron airport (she was goin to NYC for the weekend).  I don't know exactly why, but the cops were all over the place this past weekend; sure, I know that 4th of July is a drinking and traveling holiday and all, but I haven't seen this many cops out on New Years Eve or Memorial Day or anything!  ANYWAY...I suppose that I should throw in some metaphysical stuff here (but isn't my life SO interesting?!), for personal catharysis if nothing else.  I don't know what it is, but it feels like my life is falling apart again; on the outside everything seems ok (good job, no physical problems, no relationship problems, etc.), but of course no one else know what's goin on in the inside (where I've got myself really worried).  For better or worse (in my opinion, worse) I've become an expert at "manipulating the system" - I am able to do the least amount of work possible and still do better than most people at whatever I'm doing.  I used to pride myself on how hard I worked at things, about how I would grit my teeth and bear my way through the toughest adversity, and anymore it just seems like I've become such a wimp - if something takes more than minimal effort, I either consider not doing it at all or try to find a way to minimize the amount of effort it's going to take. And this just isn't ME, it CAN'T be me!  Have I really become like this?  Have I become such a sluggard that I can't pull myself away from the TV to do the things that I need to do (whether it be exercise, studying, cleaning, etc.)?  Or is something wrong with me?  Am I just missing the right motivation, and once I have it things will go back to being good?  And if so, what is that motivation?  And I'm feeling really lonely again (what else is new, eh?).  I try to avoid large groups of people anymore simply because it reminds me of how I'm alone when I see people together, but there wasn't any getting around it at the Indians game - there were just so many couples standing around and enjoying the game and the night and the fireworks and each other and all, and then there was me - alone.  OK, so maybe not technically (Eric and Paul and Jimmy were there), but I have done an amazing job of making myself so anti-social that I just can't be social even when I want to be (plus, I think that y'all know what I mean by "alone" ;).  And most of the people that I hung out with last summer are out of town (we don't even play v-ball any more), so my nights pretty much solely consist of coming home and doing things by myself.  And as usual I just seem incapable of developing any other sort of social relationships, so when I want to do something there isn't anyone to turn to (especially since my idea of "socializing" usually entails playing sports  competitively , something which drastically reduces my social options).  And I don't know what it's been, but I've been really cognizant of how socially inept I am lately.  I mean, it's one thing to feel alone and hope that you can find someone, but it's entirely another to feel hopelessly alone and feel totally incapable of helping yourself.  I mean, sometimes I mentally pick people out who I think are somewhat like me socially and I've been noticing that even all of them are at least able to make friends and meet people and everything.  But I just don't know what it is...maybe it's because I'm so lazy or uncreative that I can't think up things to do (like I said, my idea of socializing is playing sports), or maybe it's becuase I just emanate an aura of anti-social feelings, or becuase I'm not engaging at all and I often feel really intimidated in social situations and shy away.  Ah well...I suppose the most plausible option is to just find some job or cause or something that I can throw myself into and just work enough that I don't notice my lacking of a social life...  I heard a song on the radio the other day and I thought that it fit my situation perfectly; it's called "I Want to Live" by Josh Gracin (country, of course), and I just don't know how I'm going to get from where I am to anywhere where I'm happy...  "Sometimes I feel like I need to shake myself, to wake myself:  I feel like I'm just sleep walkin' through out life.  It's like I'm swimmin' in an ocean of emotion,  But still, somehow, slowly goin' numb inside.  I don't like who I'm becomin', I know I've gotta do somethin',  Before my life passes right by.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,  An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.  Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',  Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.  Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,  Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.  Take everything that this world has to give:  I wanna live.   Sometimes I wonder why I work so hard to guard my heart.  Well, I hardly feel anything at all.   I've spent my whole life buildin' up this ivory tower.  Now that I'm in it, I keep wishin' it would fall.   So I can feel the ground beneath me, really taste this air I'm breathin',  And know that I'm alive.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,  An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.  Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',  Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.  Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,  Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.  Take everything that this world has to give:  I wanna live,  I wanna live.   Somethin' deep inside keeps sayin life is like a vapor:  It's gone in just the twinklin' of an eye."
