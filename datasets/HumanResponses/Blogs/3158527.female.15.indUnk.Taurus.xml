      well, we've got lots of things to say hello to and lots of thing to say goodbye to.. especially this end of summer...    hello school, goodbye summer...   obviously, the opening of the next school year is coming and most of us hate it.. who hates summer anyway??? hmm.. whether we like it or not, we have to go to school and face our responsibilities like doing all those "nakakaiyak na" assignments, projects.. and we have to attend those practices wherein we don't really practice at all, we just make "kwentuhan, chikahan and bili-bili ng food sa may co-op, jollibee, mcdo at sa lahat na ng food chain sa dapitan.. and for the guys, ang walang katapusang pagraragnarok o di kaya'y billiards na may kasamang piyaya..".. hehehe.. actually, that's kinda our life in saturdays... but, we still get to finish our tasks and end with a great project...     hello freehands, goodbye working hands.. ;)   hmmm.. since the classes are starting, i will not have time anymore to wash loads of dishes everylunch! and i don't have to do the laundry anymore... ;)... sounds, lazy huh???     hello books, assignments, projects,.. goodbye overtime in internet, over-telebabad and over-texting (from the moment you wake up till the moment you sleep)..   well, i guess, it's kinda obvious... i have to spend most of my time reading my books, doing my assignments and projects... simply, i have to study really hard!!!... i can't have time for the internet that much (which i really enjoyed this summer), spending lots of time on the phone (just making chika about my kilig summer), and most of all, texting.. i have to hide it cuz u know... ;)   last,  hello, cute guys and goodbye to boredom and searching here in my place even if i know, there's none! hahaha   the most enjoyable part of being in school, of course, the cute guys! every girl in the campus is looking for them! i will get to see again my crush, Kenneth, Alvin, Paolo, Peter and other guys... hahaha... well, they're just my crush.. i'm not planning to be close to them.. okay?   hahaha.. it's really nice being in school because i know, that wherever i may look, there'll be a cutie.. compared here, there's obviously none! maybe they're not just my type?? no, i don't feel them.. no offense.. peace!!   there's a lot of things we'll miss after summer... but, we can still do these things once in a while.. ;)

      uh, well, i can't think of any title for this post... so, i decided to entitle it like that...  as you can see in my previous post which has the title, "shut up!".. i'm kinda bad-tripped   because of my sisters.. you know, they are calling me a "snatcher" because they think/feel/or whatever i am snatching other peep's "guy".. the proof, they're kinda giving more time to me than other girls.. well, it's not my problem! it's not my fault if guys are getting close to me.. plus, they're not courting me anyway.. they're just being nice and they want to make friends with me... and i'm not flirting with them anyway esp. when i know that they're already taken or whatever it may be...  uhm, just wanna make it clear to them.. ;)

      yesterday, we discussed about that... i realized that the words  pagmamahal  and  pag-ibig  are really different from each other even if they only mean one thing in english...  so here's their differences:   pagmamahal:  galing sa word na  mahal ... of course, if you love a person, u are going to take care of them  , u are willing to sacrifice for them and  mahalaga  sila para sayo. ngayon, sa word na mahalaga, makukuha natin ang words na  mahal, alaga at halaga . there's no reason behind loving a person kasi minahal mo siya dahil mahal mo siya.. di ba?  next,   pag-ibig:  ang ibig sabihin ng  ibig, gusto, like, want .. it's  more of just liking not really love.. example, u like that person because of his nice body.. but, what if naaksidente siya? eh di wala na ang nice body nya.. magugustuhan mo pa ba siya? hindi na diba? kasi un lang naman gusto mo sa kanya eh.. right?   now, kapag sinabihan ka ng  iiniibig  kita, wag kang maniniwala kasi  gusto lang yon .. pero pag sinabihan ka ng  mahal  kita,  totoo un ..     buti na lang, ang sinasabi nila sa akin, "mahal kita..;)"

      Every  start  has it's own  ending ... it is true.. right?!??  Today,  the seminar  that i attended since Tuesday is done... I shall come back there on June 4 for the Recollection... Actually, that seminar is like a review on what i have learned in my freshman and sophomore year in Catechetics... i've been  "making sisi"   to myself for throwing away my Catechetics notebook.. all of the subjects in the said seminar was written in my lectures!!! arrgggghhhh!!!   the lesson:   you should not throw away some things in the past because you can still use it in the future....   Next,  the summer vacation  or the so called,  the sarap buhay time ... one week and it's finished! i have to go back to the very cold classroom and meet back my soooo kulit, energetic and weird classmates.. well, i will meet another set of them too.. i also have to meet again my teachers and all those  "mountain high loads"  of school work... plus, i'll be having my CAT..   to look at it at the brighter side, i love going to school.. staying at home looks unusual for me. especially on saturdays wherein i usually spend the rest of the day in the campus practicing or doing my group project... this new and final year in highschool,  i'll be having new friends, i'll have my allowance and this time, i can save some of it so that i will not be poor.. ;)... since there will be classes, my time will be organized.. and the best reason why i love school: i'll get to see my crushes in the campus again and i'll be having new crushes!!! hahahaha... ;)   And last,   the thing between Eldric and me... .. WE ARE NOT! okay??!? yes.. i've been asking myself a long time ago, "what if, this thing between us   ends???" and "how is it going to end??".. "when?".. "what would be the reason?".. you see, i've got lots of questions in my head and i haven't asked him this question yet.. another thing, i wanna know kung "ano na ba kami?".. of course! i wanna know that... he might think that we are but for me, we're not... and for other people too.. i want it to be clear..  now, the thing that scares me is his uhm, not actually attitude, but the way he's talking to me.. he's not like what he was before.. you know, he seems to be cold to me.. he did not text me yesterday... plus, what if, this is how our thing ends? like, this is it! you're until here... the thing between you doesn't seem to work... first, you were just textmates.. friends, okay... but it's not personally.. you do not know him that much... next, we haven't seen each other yet...   ohhhh my!!! why is this happening?!??? you let me know this person and fell inlove with him and you're gonna end this thing just like this? =C   well, i should be ready for what's gonna happen later, tomorrow and on the next days...   in all of the endings i'll be facing, some of them may be a happy ending or unfortunately, i'll be ending everything with a tear.. whatever it will may be, i know.. after all that when i'm through with an end, i'll be having another start.. ;)

      last night i dreamed of Jeff Anthony.. because of that, memories came in my head.. uhm, he's my classmate in elementary and actually, he's my crush.. well, we're not close friends.. it's just that he was my crush and he was crushing me back.. he's not that nice.. you know, he embarrassed me in front of his friends.. he's really bad!!! and i hate him for that! well, on the other side, whenever he sees me having fun with others, he's giving a sign that he's jealous.. yes, i'm flattered about that cuz even if he's doing those embarrasing blah blah, he's still kinda affected.. ;)  another "ghost".. he's Cyrus.. well, he's always like that.. he's always on my mind even if i don't like it anymore.. i admit it that once, i've been addicted to him... but, it's not like that anymore... and i hate it now!!!

      uh, well, actually, i decided to make a new blog because i find my old blog too inlove.. well, i always talk about him.. it's him today, it's him yesterday and it's him again tomorrow.. it's not that he's out of my life.. it's just that i don't want by blog to be like that always..   next, the color: pink.. actually, i planned to change the color.. but it seems like i really love the color pink that's why i ended up, choosing a template with that color...

      well, this week's kinda different.. i'm not feeling that okay... my thoughts were playing on me and they're making me feel so MISERABLE... yeah.. i'm feeling lonely, incomplete...    june 14 -   i realized that good thing i don't have a boyfriend.. well, glessie and rembert broke up.. i saw her crying.. so sad.. napansin ko na eto ngang samin ni eldric eh nahihirapan ako... boyfriend pa kaya?!???    june 16 - "TAKE AND BRING"...  we were discussing about usage problems and my teacher gave an example for bring.. then for her example for take, she held a newspaper and said, "take this to the library.." actually, she was looking at me... and she said again, "take this!" then i asked, "now?" she said, "now!" and i asked her again so that it would be clear... "now?".. "now!".. and my classmates were laughing at me! oh my! it's kinda embarrassing actually..   another thing, aaron texted me this day.. asking for adel's number... haaay.... may be he's not over her still.. like me?!?? i'm not really that over him.. of course, i've fell inlove with him... yikes!  this line of a song is for him: "don't let me fall again for nothing more..."    june 18 -  feeling miserable.. like what i've said..            i just realized  that may be the reason why i'm feeling like this is that sobra lang lang ang pag-iisip ko sa kanya at nalunod ako sa kasweetan nya kaya ngayon, porke di siya ganun ka sweet, feeling ko di na nya ako mahal... haayyy... di ko na alam kung ano ba dapat ang isipin ko....  here are some songs for him:   I'm Missing You Lyrics By Meja   I miss your love, since you've been gone I find it hard to go on The summer sky don't mean a thing I thought I'd always be strong I got a feeling inside and it's making my heart cry, cause  I'm missing you and it's making me blue, yeah I'm missing you but what can I do Thousand miles away, from you  So here I am, and everything's new I should be happy in love but all I know, I look deep in my eyes I've never felt so alone and this feeling inside it's making my heart cry, cause  I'm missing you and it's making me blue, yeah I'm missing you but what can I do Thousand miles away, from you  So what's the meaning of this to be living like this it ain't no fun at all I wonder where are you now (I wonder where are you now)  I miss your love since you been gone I find it hard to go on and this feeling inside I just break down and cry    Cool With You by Jennifer Love Hewitt   Late last night  I was goin through some old things  When i Saw a picture of you and my best friend  It reminded me of day when you were mine  You had a way that always let me hear with a smile  I want those sweet days back agian  Cause baby   Chorus:   Its sunny day  But you're not around  That dog gone rain might as well be pouring down  Its such a shame  Cause your heart on the ground  Just wanna be cool with you again   Sometimes I sit By the fire and remonance  About the time we spent infront of it  And that old flame will never be the same  Until you come back and re-candlelight  I just wanna share my heart with you again  Cause babe   Chorus   I fall asleep at night  And often see you here  In my dreams  Holding me  But then I wake up and I realize that you're  Not here with me  It hurts so much  I gotta have you back babe   Chorus x2     well, i think, it's really for him... those are the songs that i usually sing when i feel like what i'm feeling right now...

      this week, the classes have started... and i've met my new classmates...   june 7 -   obviously, the first day of classes... felt kinda excited and nervous... i decided to text Eldric because i really missed him and sadly, he's not like what he was before... well, i ended up my day feeling very lonely, asking myself,  "ito na ba? and dito na lang? at tapos na? sana sabihin nya... para di ako mukhang ewan..."    june 8 -  hmm... i felt sooooo sad... i kept on going back on those days he was so sweet and loving... i told myself that may be, he has found someone new... and all his love was gone...   june 9 -  on this day, a thought came in my mind... i felt like, the thing that was lost in our  "mutual understanding"  or whatever you may call the thing about us, was passion... [well, kinda affected by the book i've read.. the ten secrets of aboundant love... hahaha]... i have to be sweeter or more caring than i was before... i want to keep this thing cuz, i have lived my life with his presence... and then, i convinced myself that i want the old eldric back.. the eldric i was talking to last may 9...    june 10 -  just yesterday... the same old feeling.. and this thing really sucks!!! it's breaking my heart! it's hurting me! it's making me weak!    june 11 - today.  yes! it's friday again! the difficult thing having school back is the early sleeping time and early waking time...  going back to my prob, i realized that i must learn to let him go... if this thing is really over, then i must know how to live my life again the way it was before he came in my life.. but! i won't live my life again feeling so addicted to Dondon! that'll be really stupid!   hey, i'm sorry if i was talking about my lovelife...it's just that, i can't keep this feeling inside cuz it'll drive me CRAZY!!! don't worry, i'll be over it... sooner... ;)

      hmmm.. i've just finished reading a book entitled, "No Boyfriend Since Birth"... actually, i knew about it because of my friend, AJ... well, it's a nice book... it's about a 25-year old girl who's got a lot of guys around her.. like me.. hahaha!! maraming lalaki sa buhay... and still, she has no boyrfriend... the book showed her experiences with guys.. and it was included her that her first boyfriend wasn't that good... for me, it's like "walang kwentang first boyfriend!".. they had sex first! and take note: he's her bestfriend.. it's so.... STUPID! and&nbsp;other&nbsp;dates, make outs and other stuffs..&nbsp;and then she ended up still, no boyfriend..&nbsp;and now,&nbsp;&nbsp;i think, the whole lesson is there...  we must not look for love.. or expect it.. because things will happen in the right time and place.. we just go on with our lives and do our jobs.. our priorities... good things come without us, noticing it..&nbsp;  i had fun reading it.. you know.. like what a review said, " nakakaloka!!! "...   in connection with this thing, love... i'm feeling kinda bad today... and of course, who causes this feeling? you know the answer.. yup! i'm feeling bad cuz there's something inside of me that i can't determine and i am afraid that this one is falling again once more with the same person knowing that he can't love me back.. because in his heart, still, there is my friend... and now what? i'm gonna be the same girl? i won't do it! i'm not the same martyr girl who's gonna love a guy who's inlove with someone else..and worse, he's inlove with my bestfriend.. arrrgggghhh!!! at this moment, i have to stop this feeling cuz i don't like it... not now! and not ever! PAST IS PAST... i must have left this feeling after i stepped out of the sophomore year!&nbsp;i regret that i wished that he would be my classmate this year... and now that he is,  nagsisisi na ako! ako ang nahihirapan!  and it's like everytime i look in his eyes, it's like there's something in him that&nbsp;i wanna know... o gosh! sh*t! i really hate this! well, who would like this anyway?? i've got to be busy.. i've got to occupy my mind with other things.. preferrably, my studies.. and as if he cares about this! aaarrrggggghhhh!!!!!!

      well, that title is kinda obvious.. okay, i just notice that i'm not inlove.. not that problematic girl, feeling so crazy and getting gaga over a guy.. i'm not like that at this moment... hmmm... i'm going back in being normal again.. it feels so nice.. i don't have any problems to deal with and in fact, i think, being loveless is kinda okay.. i don't want to look for my guy who's gonna hurt me once more.. well, i'll just let him come to me and let it be whatever's gonna happen... i'm a good girl and i know what am i gonna do.. i can handle things on my own... hehehehe... o gosh! i just hope that, that guy won't come during my confusion days.. i might hurt him or even myself..

      hmmm... actually, i don't have anything to say at this time.. i just wanna post something... &nbsp; i know you're kinda tired reading all of my posts about eldric, still, multo or whoever guy i have in my life... it's just that may be, my life can't be normal without guys... yes.. they're like uhm, spices in foods... you know, our lives can be boring without them.. even if they are just breaking my heart, letting me fall and others for no reason at all, they're still fun talking about... ;)  &nbsp; okay, i've got to finish my experiment paper in physics, but to think of it, i don't have the data to solve for the problems... mara and belen [well, belen is his last name.. i am used to call him by his family name..] got the wrong data so they repeated it and until now, i don't have the answers.. actually, i don't like copying something from my classmates... setting aside the "boasting thing", it's just like i can't do what i want on free time because i've gotta copy things because of my irresponsibility.. i hate that kind of attitude.. i hate cramming... :) &nbsp; yesterday, i watched UAAP in Studio 23 and unfortunately, my school lost the game.. well, it's alright.. i think, ate's right... actually, i told her that watching UAAP live in Araneta or wherever it'll be held, &nbsp;would be a great date... [date--- you know that.. not the mm-dd-y.. okay?] then she told me that i shouldn't watch my school's game because i'll get frustrated if our school will lose the game.. and now, she's right.. well, as if i'm gonna go out on a date??? i don't have anybody to go out to... and! i can't see myself asking a guy out.. i'm not desperate... hehehehe.... &nbsp; &nbsp;

      well, today's a nice day for me...in connection to that, well, as always, i'll be talking about guys... actually, they are really the best thing to talk about all the time... okay, going to that, it's like this.... &nbsp; i've noticed that everytime i pass my eyes on that guy, i can catch him looking.. hahaha... and it repeated many times.. his appearance was very funny that i could really see him move away his eyes from me... hahahaha!!! kilig!!!

      tomorrow, there'll be no classes... so, i have lots of schoolworks to do...    well, last sunday, i was kinda in the mood in making testimonials for my friends... unfortunately, those guys whom i wrote my testimonials to, didn't approve or haven't seen yet those testimonials... "sayang!"  hmmm.. days are just normal.. i just have to be really really serious with my studies.. so, i have to do all my work completely and i have to study in all my tests.. hhhhaaayyyy!!! it's kinda mahirap but i have to try.. i don't need an inspiration especially a guy.. because, guys aren't really acting as my inspiration.. instead, they act as destruction!!!! ;)

You've got your dumb friends I know what they say They tell you I'm difficult But so are they But they don't know me Do they even know you? All the things you hide from me All the sh** that you do  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  [Chorus]  It's nice to know you were there Thanks for acting like you cared And making me feel like I was the only one It's nice to know we had it all Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done  [Chorus x2]  Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
