      Well I had my unaccompanied baggage shipped off to Korea last friday, so now I must make do with what I have left. (for those of you who don't know what that is, an unaccompanied baggage shipment is a personal property shipment sent to your gaining base before you leave, in the hopes(hopes?) that it will be there waiting for you when you arrive.) I was in the middle of two different PS2 games, Front Mission 4 and Driv3r, both of which were very entertaining. I had intended on keeping my PS2 with me and carrying it to Korea in my suitcase, along with FM4 and Driv3r. It was a sound plan, but I forgot to keep the games seperate from the shipment, so they are now on the way to my next base. So I had to buy some other games to keep me from boredom. I bought Drakengard, and I bought Everything or Nothing. Both of them are pretty fun. I just wish that the bond game was in first person, like goldeneye on n64 was...  oh well

      And here we go. Now that I have established my personal history, I can begin to post my feelings and opinions on stuff. I should start with a little disclaimer: I think reviews of other peoples creations, be it art, movies, music, video games, are usually bullshit. People go and see a movie, and they say it sucks. But what do people know? Personally I like most movies. If I don't like it, it doesn't mean it sucks or is a bad movie, it just didn't entertain me. I like Ebert and Roper, because the simply reccommend movies, not neccessarily on the basis of a movies atistic value, but on it's entertainment capabilty. Alright, I guess that's enough for now...

      And so I joined the Air Force... I went to basic training at age eighteen. It was a horrific experience while there, everyone is running around scared and bald while some old guy is screaming at us and calling us Nancy and stuff. We are taught to eat so fast you don't chew or swallow or taste. We would be expected to fold our underwear into little squares, but I couldn't ever get it right, because some dumbass had burnt hiself with his iron, and noone was allowed to use irons anymore. So all of our underwear was wrinkly, which pissed our TI(training instructor) off, and he would throw our undies around in a fit of rage. After basic, we went to our job training, which for me was carpentry and metalworking. At this training, we were slowly allowed more and more freedom, so we didn't go crazy after the six weeks of Nazi school, I mean basic training.  In tech school I learned how to build stuff out of wood and metal, which is nice. However when I got to Barkesdale Louisiana, my first assignment, I was assigned to a zonal maintenance shop. Which meant I was a repairman, not a builder. So almost all of the training I recieved was for nothing. I had to learn the whole job from scratch.  I had left my parents house in Ft Worth, to travel the world in the Air Force. After three years in, the farthest I had traveled was Ft. Walton Beach, where we went for a week long training session. I had basic in San Antonio, and tech school in Gulfport, Mississippi. Finnaly I was in Barkesdale, Louisiana for two years, which is less than three hours from home. Eventually I recived an assignment to Korea. Now I was getting a chance to see the world. The armpit of the world, perhaps, but at least it was overseas.  Korea was a weird place for me to be. Normally, young 'uns like me drink themselves stupid every night while in Korea. Now, I don't drink, so I wasted my time with video games instead. And since all the other guys were out drinking, I played them all by my self. All year long. After the year was up, I was sent to Mildenhall, England. Here in England, I spent most of my time still playing video games or watching anime. I also watched movies and read a lot. There wasn't a lot for me here. I didn't want to travel to all the touristy areas. I hate looking at old buildings. What is the point of smothering every visitor to your city with the your own history. Every time, these tour guides give you some romanticized version of history, which the tourists eat up. It's like wathing a movie based on a true story. Not a documentary. Anyway, I'm here in England for another two weeks. Then I'm going back to Korea. That's all folks... My life story(condensed version)

      I last left off with my Dad's wedding to Chauncie...  Chauncie was a secretary at Budget Rent-a-Car, at DFW airport. She had two children, Jeanie and Chris. Jeanie was four years older than me, and I don't have any idea who her father was. Chris her half brother, and my new stepbrother, was four years younger than me. His dad moved to El Paso som time after the wedding. We all lived in an house in Hurst, Texas, a suburb of Ft. Worth.  We went to Hust Hills Elementary, which was just a short walk away. I guess I liked the school, but I was never an over acheiver, in fact, it was at this school that I began my tendancy to do just enough to pass.  I enjoyed science classes the most, followed by music class in second, and pretty much nothing else after that. In class, when given an assignment, I would usually speed through it, and complete as much as I could before class was over. I never did any homework, almost throughout my entire twelve years in school. That's not counting the panicked nights before a major project was due, where I would wake up in the middle of the night, and scribble some crap on a paper, and hope the teacher would accept it as something I worked on for the last two weeks. The culprit in the situations was usually my extreme leanings towards procrastination. Something I still retain even to this day...  Anyway, I attended Hurst Hills untill sixth grade, then I was enrolled in Hurst Junior High, which was farther down the same road. At junior high(grades 7-9, for everyone who went to middle school) I joined the band, was on the football team, and spent most of my free time in the library or at the bus stop with my best friend, Russ.  Let me take a second to talk about Russ. Russ has been my best friend since we met in fifth or sixth grade. We have wasted countless hours playing Nintendo, watching movies, talking about stuff, and generally doing all sorts of crap kids do to have fun. There are several stories that I can tell on that, but I'll get to that later.  Ok, I played the trumpet in the band, crappily. I was in the band up untill eleventh grade, then I quit. By then I had found the only other thing I enjoyed in school. The Blueprint.  The Blueprint was L.D.Bell High School's newspaper. The newspaper class was held at lunch period, and the the atmosphere was relaxed enough to allow for longer lunches, and some fun while class was in session. Most of my fond memories were of the Blueprint.  I initially joined to become a photographer, but I wrote crappy reviews for movies and sports stories instead. I also ended up with my own editorial column my senior year, called "System Error".   I drove an old Mazda pickup with a camper shell on the bed, it was pretty old too. The fiberglass would crack around the boltdowns and would occasionally fly off the truck while I was driving down the road. Which sucked, alot.   I drove that truck until high school, when my parent's gave me my sisters old Nissan Sentra. I used it until I got a ticket for driving 71mph in a 45mph zone. Then my parents took it away and made me drive the old Mazda again.  I graduated in 97(at seventeen) with a GPA of 1.32 I think, and worked at Target while going to community college for a semester and a half. Then I dropped out. Which kinda sucks, because I really enjoyed Geology. But I was paying for my own classes, and books, and my pay at Target wasn't all that great to begin with.  So I began to look for another source of income... The United States Air Force.  To be continued....

      Right,   So I know not everyone cares about my origins, but someone may want to know someday. So here it is, in easy to follow chronological order. (did I spell cronological right?)(note to self, look up chronological in the dictionary, and then delete this sentence)  Oh, before I get started, I think I should make a note of the fact that certain parts of my memory have been altered by repeated views, and warped by Time's telescope, so all of the facts may be different from how others remember them(Hi mom and dad!) Also, I have a little bit of trouble placing certain parts of my early youth in order, so don't get confused about it...  September 26th, 1979, Channelview Texas: A boy(me) was born to my parents in a hospital. According to my father, I lived in Houston with my parents for a while, untill we moved to Terrell, Tx. I lived with my parents on some sort of farm house(i think) with other portions of our family. My parents divorced just as I was forming longterm memories, so one of my first distinct memories was them asking me who I wanted to live with, "Mom or Dad?"   I chose Dad, I guess, because I lived with him untill I was five years old. During that time, I had a friend named Brad, who lived across the street from me, we played in a little fort in the trees next to his house. I went to the First Baptist Church of Terrell, and one day I interrupted the sermon the preacher was giving, because i misinterpreted my dads directions to the bathroom. I ended up walking up on the pulpit, behind the preacher, and out the far door.   My Dad's house in Terrell was the family's house from at least my Grandfather's time, and My Father and I shared it with a few other guys. I believe the guys were, Rusty, Mike, and some other guy I can't remember. My Dad and I shared one bedroom, and the other guys each had a room too.  I would visit my Mom untill she moved to Florida with some Air Force guy.  I guess my Parent's thought I was a smart kid, because they tried to enroll me in school a year early. However, in the state of Texas, you had to be six years old by the beginning of the school year. I would turn six on September 26th, but the school year started on September 1st. So I was sent to live with my Mother in Ft Walton Beach, Florida. She was married to a guy named Joey, a Senior Airman in the Air Force. He was kinda short I think, and they lived in a trailer park somewhere near a Piggly Wiggly.  I remember watching the Monkeys everyday after school with my friend Stephen. Stephen was the kind of kid that would get you in trouble all the time, and Joey was the kind of guy to punish you at every oppourtunity... so you can see, this was a bad mix. Also it should be noted that after I left to live with my dad in Texas again, my Mom divorced Joey. She said he was abusive towards me, but I have no memory of it, perhaps I have blocked it out...I don't know.  My school was ok I think, I cannot remember much besides the fact that I was the only white kid in my class, and our school mascot was the Dolphin.  I had two pets while I lived there. A cat named Tom, and a gerbil named Jerry. I have never had any pets since that were nearly as cool as those two.  After the school year I visited Disneyworld with my parents, then I was sent back to Texas to live with my Dad again. When I got there I attended my Dad's wedding to Chauncie, my new step-mom.  This concludes part 1...

      Okay,  Anyway, I'm new to the whole blog thing, but nobody cares. I guess I'm a little slow when it comes to this sort of thing. But I have read other blogs, and thought some of them were pretty neat.  I used to want one of my own, but I thought I had to be a HTML junkie to even start. I'm not. I'm not even close. I don't even know what HTML stands for. But as I always say, ignorance is bliss.  I want to lay out my thoughts in my blog, much the same way I did when I had a column in the school newspaper. I guess I should describe myself then, since people may become curious later. I will, but not in this post, I'll put it in the next one, the story of my life...  till next time,  D

      So, I've been back in the states for a few days now, and I must say I'm shocked by all the big changes in the last six months. For instance, this Atkins crap... where the hell did all this marketing come from? And what's up with the new fast food laws people are putting out, like getting rid of deep frying by 2009 and stuff. Coca cola has changed to meet the new needs with their break free cola, and too many other little things to list. Also, the slide shows that they showed before movies is gone, replaced by twenty minutes of advertisements. That's not so bad, though. since the ads are pretty entertaining. The first time you see them.  eh, I'm done...

      And now I have beaten Drakengard, so that's useless to me forever. Unless of course I want to see all the endings and all the story. I dont Know if I have that much patience...  I kinda quit playing Bond too, it just lost it's appeal.  I dunno if I'll come back to it.  I'm playing Beyond Good and Evil, as soon as I hook my PS2 up to my hotel TV.
