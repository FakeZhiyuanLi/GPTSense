       Welcome back.    I apologize for being away from the blogosphere for so long. A lot has happened in the last six months and I could never write it all down in so much as an essay here. I have changed the format of this site somewhat so as to give me a space to write all angles of the human experience. From essays to humor articles to poetry and song, I hope this can be inspirational to anyone who might be in need.

       A Ton of Diets, Figuratively Speaking   An Essay   As of this morning, I have lost roughly thirty-five pounds. Being proud of this achievement, I decided to reward myself with a bowl of Frosted Flakes. Two months ago, my wife and I decided to lose weight the Dr. Phil way. Back in September, when Dr. Phil began his weight loss series, he was quick to address that this plan was not a diet, but rather a change of lifestyle. He added, further, that he did not intend to become a part of the overrated, multi-million dollar, overpaid dieting industry. So, naturally, he published a book entitled,  The Ultimate Weight Solution , followed by its companion,  The Ultimate Weight Solution Food Guide , and then endorsed “Shape Up,” a  diet  candy bar. I sure am glad he isn’t trying to capitalize on the overrated, multi-million dollar, overpaid dieting industry.  Losing weight has been a wonderful experience. And most people can say they’ve tried a million diets – and then some. There have, after all, been a ton (no pun intended) of diet plans that have come and gone, then come back, and then leave again. A great example of this was the “Low Fat” diet. Remember this diet?   Nothing on the “Low Fat” diet was off limits, providing you simply chose to eat the “Fat-Free” or “Reduced Fat” version of it, which tasted basically the same, only with three grams of sugar missing. For example, one person on the “Low Fat” diet might see another person on the same diet eating a bowl of ice cream. She would ask the woman eating the ice cream, “Hey, is that double-fudge-chocolate-chip ice cream with brownie chunks?”  The woman eating the ice cream would reply, “Why, yes, but that’s okay. It is, after all, one-third lower in fat!”  The two women would then exchange a hearty laugh, and then both would indulge in double-fudge-chocolate-chip ice cream with brownie chunks.   I gained twenty-two pounds on the “Low Fat” diet.   The “new” popular (and now, completely overrated) diet is the low carbohydrate diet. Everyone is working to cooperate with this diet. Burger King, Sonic, Applebee’s, and TGI Fridays all have “Atkins”-friendly menu items. I lost thirty pounds on the low carb diet…the hard way, too, I might add. I did this diet six years ago. Where were the Sugar-free Hershey bars then, huh?  Six years ago, there were no “Atkins”-friendly menu items or “South Beach Diet”-friendly menu items. If someone were to ask you six years ago, “Hey, want to go to Outback and get some Aussie cheese fries?” you would have known that there was no chance of this meaning that there were actually  low-carb  Aussie cheese fries. They were simply cheese fries. Your answer, if you were like me, would be, “Cheese fries? No, thank you. I just ate two cows, a pig, and half-a chicken at the house! I’m watching my weight, thank you very much!”  If you were to walk into Subway today and tell the sandwich maker that you were watching your carbs, he would say, “Hey, no problem. We’ll just put this in a nice carb-free wrap for you! Enjoy!” If you had asked this same sandwich maker to watch the carbs six years ago, you might have suggested, “Hey, why don’t you just wrap this in some old turkey fat. I’m watching my carbs!”  The Dr. Phil diet seems to really work, although the secret is pretty simple. Are you ready? Here it is: Watch your calories and exercise. That’s it!  And every physician in the continental U.S. is going, “Why didn’t I write that down?”  This is the stuff they’ve been telling us for years. For those of you interested in the Dr. Phil plan, it is a lot more complicated than that, and there are some interesting psychological lessons for why we are addicted to food. All I know is that the farm animals can rest a little easier in my neighborhood tonight. There are no carb diets here.

       NASCAR Would Be Proud: The Unmaking of a Bad Driver   An Essay    I can’t drive. There, I said it. What tends to be an impossible feat for men has just been done…in writing: an admission of failure. Some might view this in the same context of an apology, although as a male human being, I could never admit to such a thing. Could this go without saying? Probably.   So, why bring this up? After all, apologies and admissions of failure are touchy subjects with men, unless they happen to be gay of course. In that case, those men have already boldly defied society’s view on what they think a man should be, so I will exempt them from this horribly stereotypical view on the male ethos here.   At twenty-four years old, I have now been driving for nearly a decade. In my first five years of driving, not once did I get a ticket. Did that mean that I was an excellent and cautious driver? Not in the least. As a matter of fact, I don’t really know how I’m still alive now. My best guess is that God had found some grace in me and allowed me the vehicular mistakes, until He finally was fed up and said, “Oh, won’t somebody just pull this moron over!”   And so, finally somebody did. And then again. And again. And again. After much soul searching, I think I have it figured out. When I drive alone, I am indeed, a model citizen. Cars, motorcycles, pets, and even pedestrians are all safe when I drive alone. I rarely speed (to say I never speed would be a horrible lie), I obey all traffic signs, and I am often courteous enough to allow other cars and trucks to share the freeway with me (again, to say I always do this would make me a liar).   Even when music is playing, I seem to drive quite normally. Not quite a Driver’s Ed teacher, but normal nonetheless.  When I drive with people, however, none of the above rules apply. It’s not that I have this defiant nature in which government laws do not apply to me. It’s more along the lines of not being able to “walk and chew gum at the same time.” Amazingly enough, I actually can walk and chew gum at the same time, so don’t write me off as hopeless yet. It’s more defined as “not being able to drive and talk to/entertain passengers while checking my voice mail messages on my cell phone and adjusting the CD player all at once.”  After all, being able to do all of these things at once is what makes us American men, right? I can’t count myself so lucky yet. In nine years of driving, I am fortunate enough to say I’ve only been in four wrecks, only three of which were actually my fault.   Here’s a nice tidbit of knowledge: if you are so tired that you think there may actually be a good chance of falling asleep at the wheel, in the best interest of those whose time (and fender) you undoubtedly will waste, please don’t drive! Been there, done that, got the T-Shirt!   Twice!  I could take this opportunity to address how silly other countries might view Americans who drive while talking into a [wireless] telephone that was obviously invented to keep us from actually communicating to each other  in person . How silly and pretentious we must look to them.  But, I won’t go there. Instead, I will assume full responsibility of my failures as an American driver. I must accept the fact that I will never be a fast enough driver to be the next Jeff Gordon, and I’ll never be careful enough to be a valet.  Maybe I should just stick to what my calling is on the road with other people: a good back seat passenger who can let his annoying phone ring as loudly as he wants. I think that decision will bring all Americans a step closer to unity.   Oh, and for all you stereotypical men: please forgive my apology.

       Break For Coffee   Coffee black, I say, black, No thank you, kindly; While rivers of caffeine and  Narcissism of tea leaves Lie tattered in the realm  Of mind so tired. Could you be so darling as to Fetch me my life? Chaotic undertones are mere understatement Of busy signals and blogospheres; Curled unto the undying entertainment Of mongers of dead smiles.

       Loophole of Fog   Water like the sprout on end Shine brightly in the heavens  And then pour yourself like rain; Improvising letters sent To war and peace coming home For the night of sandy desert. Thirst, I crave, thirst, Hunger for the girl, woman; Gracious grievances on high And locked within the loophole of fog.  Nightfall lands and rivers bend But creases fold on words  And then pours itself like rain; Acting sorrowful and bleak With pride and fancy footwork Hiding sleep and hiding frame, Under the bed, the door, the flame With underwater passion And sealed within the loophole of fog.  Water like the sprout on end Glow brightly in the heavens And then douses its flame with rain; Reading darker letters still With war and peace, not home For the night of icy wasteland. Thirst, I crave, thirst, Hunger for the woman, girl; Gentle nagging gripping cry And beating at the door within the loophole of fog.

       Prayer of the Mystics: What is the Evidence of the Holy Spirit?   An Essay   In my faith tradition, the evidence of receiving baptism of the Holy Spirit is speaking in unknown languages – or “tongues,” as we like to put it. Our scholars understand this “evidence” as biblical through Acts 2:4: “Then, like a wildfire, the Holy Spirit spread through their ranks, and they started speaking in a number of different languages as the Spirit prompted them.” (The Message)  I must confess, I believe I have received this “evidence,” and on more than one occasion, I have heard the unknown languages spill from my lips. Was it me? Was it God? And what’s the point? These are the questions that have plagued me since the beginning of my understanding of the Holy Spirit. Why do I wrestle with it?  See, I just happen to be a young pastor in youth ministry (yes, we in youth ministry are pastors – we are not pastors “in training.”) and I believe that if this is truly the work of God, and if it indeed changes our lives as human beings, then I don’t want my students to be denied something so wonderful. But, what exactly is so wonderful about it?   This “evidence” of speaking in unknown tongues was discovered in America at the turn of the twentieth century, when Charles Parham, a holiness professor in Topeka, KS, encountered a young woman in his school who claimed to have received this “gift.” The young woman wanted to know if this was from God. After much study and discussion among other scholars, Parham decided that it was indeed biblical, although Acts 2 had never been taken quite so literally before that point. As the Pentecostal movement spread throughout the West in America, what began as a few “outbursts” in the Holiness sect of the Methodist church, led to a separation from which these “tongue-talking” Christians began their own denomination that we know today as the Pentecostal church.   While these Pentecostal churches and denominations remained an active part of the evangelical group of churches, the “Gift of Tongues” is probably more reminiscent to a Catholic relic – a form of mysticism to those who are unaware of it. Catholics, in fact, were some of the first churches to begin practicing this “speaking in tongues” once the movement spread throughout the United States in the early twentieth century. Shortly thereafter, many stopped and took back their stance that this was unbiblical.  The question I pose is this: Is it mysticism? Many readers may squirm in their seats with a big fat “NO!” (My wife is probably one of them). I pose this question, because it seems that many of the Pentecostal churches I have attended seem to focus on this “mystic gift” rather than on God. A few weeks ago, I heard a woman preach in my own church, “Our churches are letting evidence of tongues die! We have to hold onto this [tradition].” This troubled me, not because I think “tongues” are irrelevant, but because it seems to me that our focus is off the beaten path.  Have we really become so pseudo-spiritual that we think this has been about tongues this entire time? What has God been trying to teach us about this truly amazing and unique gift that we have failed to grasp? The purpose of the “fire of the Holy Spirit” was to empower the early disciples to establish the church of Jesus Christ. To this day, the purpose of the Holy Spirit is still the same, to equip disciples to spread the good news of Christ Jesus. That is all it has ever meant.  For some reason, however, it seems to me that the true disciples throughout history have never once flaunted this sacred gift. They must have had it, for its purpose of evangelism and life-changing hope was carried out in their ministries. St. Francis of Assisi, for example, was one such disciple that traded in his family fortune for a life spent giving to the poor and exploited people throughout his society.  A modern day example of this was the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., who took the hope and good news of Christ Jesus to all of those who – even a century after slavery had ended in America – were still oppressed and exploited throughout American society. His message was hope in God. A message that still changes hearts today.  Is the baptism of the Holy Spirit important in these postmodern times? I absolutely believe that it is. But, is the “initial evidence of speaking in other tongues” what we should be seeking? Or is it more? Is the purpose of initial evidence so that others in our churches would see it and be impressed? Is it so that our Pentecostal pastors and preachers would feel a hint of spiritual ecstasy as their egos are enhanced? If so, we are in grave danger of blasphemy.  Or is this gift meant as a sacred relic of hope for the purpose of feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and sheltering the homeless? These are the important things in life as Christ saw them. These are the things that will count for eternity. This is evangelism in its purest form. Should the gifts of the Spirit be practiced in churches. Absolutely, but they should be practiced for the purpose of evangelism, not a sideshow for the church.   Evangelism is the true evidence of the Holy Spirit in our lives. If we are filled with His Spirit, it will be evident to people through our works. If we are speaking unknown languages and still ignoring the beaten-down “sinners” of our time, we have truly missed the point and God is not honored by our selfishness.  __ Do you agree? Disagree?

       Insomnia   Clickety!   The tick hand moves on Upward toward dawn and a slice; Graceful and silent, and hush with a wave, And a bag full of yawn and bright smiles  Clickety!   The morning leads noon, In wee small hours of daylight; Donuts could jump and a sheep might not say, Could not sleep come and rescue my night.

       Lover   Lightly you sleep, Sweet angel of mine; Into tunnels of grace And in tunnels of flight. Praying to God That you’ll forever stand by Onward you sleep, O sweet angel of mine.  Gracefully you sleep, Sweet angel of mine; Might you remember the dance That we shared in the twilight. With the hour in my hand, I thanked God I’m alive As I watch you sleep on, O sweet angel of mine.  Metaphor might be lost And simile could be harkened, But you’ll sleep on soundly, And I’ll keep close watch.  And I’ll drift off to sleep, Sweet angel of mine; As I glance in your place With soft song and a sight, Once my eyes are closed off, And my breath softer light, I’ll dream on of you, O sweet angel of mine.  I’ll dream on of you, And soon wake to your light.

       Prayer For Scalawags   Quickly approach The dawn of daybreak With crickets of mercy and Scalawags of honor; Do these creatures exist For the pleasure of mere mortals, Or could it be higher, This purpose in mind? When wrath of angry men Could poison society cold, Through nightfall and rain, Through rain and through flood, Might their shallow prayers be heard? Or did you speak to the lone evangelical In the room of naysay thought? Might money and coffee Have played a role in the undoing Of his rightousness? Might you prey on the poor standing Citizens of night, But only for mere seconds more; The counting must subside.

       Paradise   Long since suspected  Carry you force and energy propelled By water and fueled by grace; Where the tinman waits for his oil change And the poet writes from the mirror; If ever dreams passed land and sea, The folly of present tense world would wait, Through storms and wind They’d wait ‘til season’s end For the harvest of enjoyment to overwhelm Even the most archaic of characters  Ah, such dreams could carry on  Over a distant horizon

       Son   Memories of a sky blue sunset long passed The eve of soul and symmetry, When love and lovers joined for tea, And formed from emptiness a being of light.  From light you grew to light you sleep, And in darkness fall sick to your own surroundings; Until breath is hard, Hard for life to defeat approaching enemy.  O Stifle of breath and stiffening of laughter Plagued seed of man and dreamscape lost, Before your welcome mat was placed And a banner hung from the corner of your world to the outside street.  Memories of a sky blue sunrise long passed The dawn of soul and symmetry; Another day to fruition comes, And in emptiness, I’ll walk the mile of a long day gone.  Forever.

       Sacred Angel of Bewilderment   O say you Dark Angel to the Laughing Man, “Why not come and sing to me? Lonely soul am I tonight, And robbed of my own pride and contentment.” Laughing Man in crouched bewilderment, Noteworthy causes aside, Tells the Angel of the sacred space between soul and mind The mind of a dark and hollowed soul; The soul of a dark and hollowed mind; And answers in the black remain riddled, Riddled with laughter, and riddled with pain Until sob breaks and sky moons over; The break of day pardoned To clouds of dark night. O say you Dark Angel to the Crying Man, “How far down below? Lonely soul am I tonight, And live on, the Sacred Angel of bewilderment.”

       Dare   Seizing an opportunity right, Thought but never spoken. If altogether beautiful harmonious night Could join with angels singing? Hushing mouth out of sheer pale fright With the index finger of no-wave circles. Could pry the jaws with all its might Or would silence there prevail? And to nod to the elephant in the light As he passes by this room. Dare I speak this night?
