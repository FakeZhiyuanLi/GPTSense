      Hope everyone had a Merry Christmas. I had a thrilling babysitting job on the 26th up at Congdon's. Yipes! I had four little darlings to watch over while the parents went on a much deserved dinner escape. Ranging in age from 5 to 11...three girls and one boy...all mischevious when in a group, but not so bad individually. The nice thing was when I found out that two more had gone home to Texas earlier in the day, so I didn't have the original six to look after. I'm not super sitter or anything, and I really don't know how people do it that have adopted several kids at once...it's exhausting!! The best part is, I've apparently made a great impression on the family's matriarch, to where she embraces me upon sight. I've been asked to come back in February for a board meeting, to which I said, "yes" graciously. Taking the opportunities as they approach is good. To say nothing of the fact, that I'll take any chance to go up to the castle I can get...it's gorgeous anyways, but especially so with the holiday decor. Ah....nibbling on bon bons and krumkake while watching football and blogging. Gotta love it. Oh, and there's snow on the ground...slick for church this morning, but beautiful nonetheless.

      I've been out in the chaos that is Yakima, and have returned victorious! Anyway, now I have to find my short black skirt...of course I know where ALL of my long ones are, but the short ones are being elusive. I have to wear a short one under my choral robe for Carols & Candles tonight...suppose that means I have to dig out nylons too. Hmm. Well, the tree is all trimmed, table's all set, and we're still working on the food...but it's cozy with Mom, Dad, Karen and Grandma here. Merry Christmas everybody!!

      Whee! Figuring out how to get my Yahoo profile and photo albums on here...and succeeding! Tried my Hotmail stuff...it's pickier than Yahoo. And for those of you that don't know why I'm using that...I'm cheap and like to use the free stuff if I can. Anyway, I'm famished, and Mom's got something tasty on the table, so I'll get back to this later. Ciao!

      Ha! I figured out how to not only get a guestbook on this thing, but a spiffy button as well. Little victories, but for the technologically inept, every one counts. Still confounded by comments and the color changing thing and everything else, but..by golly I'm making progress. Until I get them figured out, email me with questions/answers/concerns...(although I don't know why anyone would have any concerns at this juncture).

      Hello. Or in Muppet-speak, Beaker-style...Meep, Meep. I'm getting this thing started, but am still confused as to how I'm supposed to work with this code thing. Will enlist friends' help in the near future for that to "spifify" it. Ciao for now!

      *yawn* Yo. Is it bedtime yet? Seems like all I do anymore is eat and sleep. Sleep and eat. Vicious cycle...and monotonous. Slightly windy today. I wasn't really out to find out for myself, but I hear tell of such things from the parental units.

      Went out with the family to celebrate Chinese New Year yesterday. Yippee, it's the Year of the Monkey!! And not just any monkey...the Golden Monkey, so that's got to mean this'll be a good year, right?? I am the only Monkey in a family full of Dragons. Anyway, my fortune cookie was encouraging, even if I haven't seen any major changes yet this year. But all of this was yesterday.   Today, is my 23rd Birthday. Not that that means anything, just putting that out there. Absolutely amazing who remembers what, when. I'm one of these people who writes stuff down for future use...ie; if I know of someone's birthday/anniversary/etc...I email/write/call to acknowledge it. Every year, I have less and less people who remember, or even care what I'm up to. Not that I want constant mailbox flooding whether email or box, or the phone ringing off the hook...but it's gotten to the point where if I don't initiate the contact, I won't hear from anyone. And even then, I can't be guarranteed of ever getting a response if I leave a message. (Kunze, you're an exception!) There's the tangent for the day...communication failure in the technological era...go figure.   I got ahold of my "roommate", Jennifer and had a lovely chat with her tonight. I could hear her mom in the background saying "hi". After several years of celebrating our birthday together, since graduating from high school, we still try to call or write each other every year. Probably should clarify for those that don't know the story.... Jennifer and I were born the same day at the hospital, and our mom's were in the same room, so we call each other roommates. Our parents wondered if we'd ever meet each other in life, and to everyone's surprise, we ended up classmates at West Valley, and were even locker partners.   It's been a typical day, and now I'm going to bed. *yawn* Ciao.

      Went out shopping with Rachel, Andrea, and Dianna Thursday, and then Karen and I went up to their house. Ended up having an adventure, as we usually do when us girls get together. Drea was trying to finish Bill's cake, which partially fell; Ali and Karen were trying to get the DVD player up and running for us to watch a movie; Rachel and I were getting popcorn going, and dashing between the girls. Eventually, we ended up all huddling together in the alcove enthralled with "Pirates of the Carribbean", and Dianna threw the Christmas ribbon-bows at us to unravel while we watched. Then the DVD player started fouling up, and I think it took us thirty minutes to watch one scene, since we had to stop/start several times amid pixelating(is that even a word?). The prelude to all of this, was having all four of the girls pushing the car as I attempted to get in the driveway and off the rutted, icy road. That in itself took a good fifteen minutes at least. To magnify an already interesting evening, I thoroughly got chastised upon returning home, later than expected, because Karen had school the next day. I dearly love socializing with my friends and their families, but sometimes, it just doesn't pay to leave the house.

      Alrighty...I had voice with Debra yesterday. And somehow, after months of not really doing anything, I managed to bust out one of my French pieces with the correct breathing and pretty darned good diction too. Now focusing on the technique, hopefully I can get back into shape. I was just informed that I will be doing several auditions and attending more master classes in the near future. Woo woo!

      Bill Green- thanks for checking in! I get up to the park usually every year, and get a little sad when I can't go. My family usually likes to go camping in the summer when we all have some time off. (Everyone that knows my family, knows what a rarity it is for all of us to go on extended vacations together.) Typically, they are 2-3 day stints complete with lots of hiking. We love the Silver Falls Trail and the Grove of the Patriarchs. We try to hook up with more family members too, and that usually results in craziness between the cousins. Although Grandma can cause a ruckus by herself, and the rest of us get doubled over in laughter before long.

      Drei KÃ¶nigs Fest came and went. Unless you've studied German, this means nothing...ignore it. For the rest of you, Ephiphany came and went. We took all our Christmas stuff down, like we do every year. Which, in all the well-below freezing temperatures, was interesting. Spend as much time indoors...and dash with the boxes to the garage as fast as possible...safely of course. Icicles are everywhere...why buy those lights when nature provides plenty? Of course this is coming from frugal little me. I only have spasms of spending. Those lights seem a frivolous expense for some reason. Anywho...it's cold.

      Oh, technology is so much fun. I tried to get on the internet New Year's Day...and my laptop kept dying on me and refusing to let me gain access to most every website I attempted to. Anyway, well...happy new year, even if belated. We've gotten a foot of snow over the last couple of days, and subsequently have hibernated like bears around here. There have been avalanches, missing persons, and enough slipping cars crashing into one another for an episode of America's Funniest Home Videos...even though it's no laughing matter.  I was very last minute invited to a party at Nick's...and ended up not going.  1) I have no car, since it's requiring massive amounts of moola for parts, and Dad's and mine elbow grease in the freezing temperatures.  2) Since my folks, sister and grandma were all going out to Terrace Heights for a get together with college friends (and I'd known about it far in advance since we do it every year), we had an entirely different route to go pick up grandma and head East...it didn't include a half hour detour North to Selah. (I wasn't about to make everybody go all the way out there.)  3) Why is it when people come home for the holidays, or even if they're here all the time, that I have to go meet them? No one ever comes over here to see me. Well, I'm tired of being beckoned. Don't wait until last minute, and invite me just because I happen to pop online. Consider the fact that I may already have plans. If you really want to see me, email me in advance...or call. You know, the telephone is a wonderful invention...people should utilize it instead of being afraid. Snail mail also works...but as Rachel and I can attest...it's difficult to get anyone to do that. We're such a lazy society. It takes maybe 5 minutes to put a little thought into a notecard, slap a stamp on it, and drop it off at the post office. Now, it is nice to put more time into it, with decorative touches that are personalized, but not necessary for those with little/no patience for that sort of thing...(guys, mainly). Anyway, that's my rant for the day. In today's instant society, take a few moments for civility. It not only will get you further in the day and life, but it will also make you feel better.

      *sigh* I'm exhausted after 32 hours working at the castle. It's always nice to see the family in between their board meetings, and comforting to hear the squabbles between them. You realize they're just like everyone else...just wealthier. Anyway, I've been on my feet all that time, and had about 5 hours sleep in between, and I didn't eat like I should have...I was busy with prep work or table work or dishes...who has time to eat? I came home after the first day, and looked like a zombie according to Mom. However, 48 hours of work has now provided me with enough funding to go back to school next quarter...well, at least one class. So tomorrow I make the rounds at the admissions and counciling offices. I have got to get this education thing over with already.

      Bleak weather we're having...and then a few rays of sunshine. Joy and sorrow are intertwined. My neighbor Marcy passed away today from heart complications. She was the same age as my parents. Her children were a couple of years ahead of me in school, and my sister often watched their house and pets when they were out of town. Since both of my parents are deacons in the church, we have offered to help at the service. Hug your parents and siblings. Tell them you love them.

      Blast that Phil! I am, of course, speaking of that poor sleepy creature hauled out of his hole once a year by a bunch of Monopoly men. I know he's only got a 37% accuracy trend, but I would have liked this year to follow in that vein, rather than what we're left to endure for several weeks. Happy hibernation.

      Woah. Two weeks later, I return. Lest people think I've vanished off the face of the planet, I have not. Sometimes there are just days where nothing happens, and nothing is not worth mentioning. Ok...  1.  After a year of nothing, zilch, nil...I finally have enough money to take one....(ok, two) classes. A 5 and 1 credit. School started yesterday. I've got an evening english class 4 nights a week, and a latin ballroom dance class once a week....despite now being partnerless. ( I just discovered that today. If someone says they'll do something...pardon me for believing that they'll follow through.) *rolling eyes*  2.  I'm housesitting again this weekend, with a sweet black lab to watch.  *Bonus*  The good news is, now I can also afford not only tuition, but the textbooks required for the class as well. I forgot about that part when I was deciding if I could go back or not. Whoops!  3.  JH Production stuff is interesting, even if I'm just an extra and understudy right now. Have the option to do music videos and build up my reel over the coming weeks. And get my portfolio updated within "The Family" too. Who would have thought Yakima would have this kind of opportunity, if you just knew where to look? I am grateful to Yakima Exposures for opening this door last year. Nothing to really talk about  with the rehearsal process right now, as changes are abundant at this stage.   4.  I'm not part of the YVCC musical this quarter because of my evening classes and production work. And the minor detail, that I wasn't informed about auditions for "Bat Boy" in enough time to change my mind anyway. So, to find out my dance partner is in it, is discouraging. And, a friend of mine in production is also in a play at the Warehouse, which I didn't know about either...so altogether, I'm trapped and desperate to perform. If I tried to multi-task...well, someone ultimately would be mad at not being able to monopolize my time. It's happened before...and I'm not mentioning names.  5.  My friend Audrey showed up last week, on leave from the Navy, for her birthday. She's always surprised why my folks let us hang out together. She admits she's a bad influence, and yet she respects us when she's here, so I don't understand why she still thinks that. She's only got one year left in the service and is thrilled about getting out.  6.  I'm at the point where I'm going to have to clean my voice teacher's house in order to pay for lessons. And then there's the fees for competition coming up...and I was just informed, not asked, that I'm in a recital in 3 weeks. Sheesh, thanks. It sucks to be broke.  7.  In May, I'm working at Congdon's again, the same weekend I have tickets to attend Portland Opera's "The Barber of Seville"...so I won't be making the same as if I were available the full weekend, but it'll be nice anyhow. Consequently, it's the same weekend as the college play ( another reason I can't do it), and I'll be in the thick of working on my final essay, presentation, paper, and journal before the final exam.   I have months or seasons where nothing happens and I sit at home and eat and sleep. Check the mail and let the cats in and out.  Then I'll have a dozen things on the same weekend. Why??? I know God uses life's stops to prepare for the next start, but I don't know if I can stay "stopped" much longer. It's driving me batty...and when I have no transportation as is, that's one mode that only makes things worse.   *strikes a pose* "So, how are you?"

I have enough money to take a class for Spring Quarter, and have registered!! Halleluja!! I'm waiting until next week to let you know what, just so I know it goes ok. And I have to leave now for an interview/audition for a movie/s. Ciao!!

      Realized it's been awhile since I posted...not that I haven't been reading other blogs, but I'd honestly forgotten by the time I finished reading something, that I hadn't already done mine. Whoops!! Anywho, I'm working on Mozart and Handel currently...embellishing the basics. Getting into the "Echo Chamber" is hard to accomplish when you're not exactly sure what you're supposed to be feeling when you're there, versus just singing on its own. Probably could use some clarification of terms from Rachel...aka the learned pupil.  Check this out...how impressed I am.   'Tis a great mystery, but somehow you have come to belong in Jane Eyre; a random world of love, kindness, madness, bad luck and lunatic ex- wives. There really isn't much to say about the place you belong in. It's your place, and though it seems far from reality largly due to how random the events are, you seem to enjoy it. You belong in a world where not too many people understand you, and where you can be somewhat of a recluse.    urlLink   Which Classic Novel do You Belong In?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       April Update    I am alive. Contrary to popular belief, I am also completely normal. Then again, who defines normality?   Classes:  English is going well, and I've aced my first paper. The second one was just handed in last week, but I feel confident in that one as well. I've come to the conclusion that it was good to take this class over again. This time around I have so much more life experience to draw upon for my essays, which makes them more interesting and overall "prity grate", as one of my classmates wrote on my peer review. Everyone, including the teacher, said my work was very detail oriented to where the reader felt like they experienced what I had. Ok, that's reassuring. Here's the creepy part: They said I was too verbose and lost them on some of the vocabulary. It is  not  my fault if someone doesn't know at the age of 30 what an abbey is, or correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling are. Granted, we live in a society where all of that has become as lax as our morals, but it continually surprises me at how  uncommon  common sense and "the basics of education" are uncomprehended. We took a poll in class the first day where I discovered that I am the only one who: 1. writes anything other than email; ie. letters. 2. lives in a stable moral environment. 3. gets along with family members (and still lives with them). Not to mention the fact that my folks are still married...to each other.   Latin Ballroom Dance  I sort-of have a partner now. His name's Greg. Don't know his last name still. We go Cha-Cha on Tuesdays at the Chalet, and then have our class at school on Wednesdays. Right now we're switching between Salsa/Mambo, Rhumba, and Samba. Let's just say my calves are in great shape. :) Greg's a great dancer, though he improvises during class and expects me to catch on to a swing maneuver in the middle of our salsa. Basically, the guy doesn't like to follow rules, and is very argumentative. We are polar opposites on the subject of recreational land use...he likes more off-road motorcycle trails and I think those people are the same ones who tromped on flowers as kids. He's 7 years older than me, but either is going through a early crisis with his age, or never grew up in the first place. I have assured Mom that this guy is strictly a dance partner. I think I'd hate him otherwise.   Housesitting  again 3 times soon...one for a gal going to Guatemala. She's a nurse, but I'm not sure if it's work related or personal. She's got a dog, cat and bird. The bird worries me the most, as I have a bad track record with them getting out.   JH Productions  has now promoted me. I am the script supervisor for the indie film  Missing The Mark . We begin shooting at the end of May, and will have our wrap party and local red carpet premiere in July. Rehearsals are a blast and we just signed our release forms; in other words, our agreement to have our name in the credits and get paid for our work. (Working in the business. Did you catch that?) Meanwhile, Lavinia and I found out we both had been conned by Sam Manfredi 5 years ago. What a small world.   Voice : The other art I pursue with passion to complete my assemblage. No joke, I'm irked. Last week Debra called to switch my lesson from Friday to Wednesday and said I needed to bring my checkbook. I showed up and ended up shelling out over $60 to an incompetent and unprofessional organization. I never even got to warm up, let alone rehearse. Spent the entire lesson selecting, or rather having selected for me, my pieces for MusicFest. Ends up, the registration forms were due March 1, and didn't get sent out until last week. When Debra called to confirm her students' coming, they said it was too late, but then changed thier minds when they noticed there weren't many voice entrants. Gee, you think that was due to thier paperwork snaffu??? They raised the rates for each division, didn't list the new ones in the priliminary book, and forgot to contact the participants. My adjudicator, Dale Moore from the Eastman School of Music has passed away in the last year, so I might get stuck with the scary lady from the Tri-Cities again. *shudder* To make matters worse, Debra informed me that the recital I'd been told about was going to be two days away and meant as a practice for the competition. She expected me to have 2 pieces prepared from my list, which I had just gotten minutes earlier. I called Keira in a desperate and frantic state. I saved the French and German art songs to work on later, and decided to pull out an old Barber standby and just concentrate on my new Mozart aria. Thankfully, it was one I'd begun to work on with Britt in Cle Elum, so I wasn't totally flying blind. It came out alright, despite the fact that I didn't breathe properly, hadn't warmed up to hit the runs and multiple octaves above middle C, and Keira and I only had a 20 minute rehearsal. More on the upcoming mayhem later.

       "April showers bring May flowers" ...unless your cat eats the peony buds for the sap...if it's not the slugs after the roots, now it's the herbivore on the prowl. Wonder if we'll have anything left by Memorial Day.  I aced my second paper in English. But, lest I get overconfident in my newfound composition abilities... I have a concept paper due for peer review in 4 hours. I drew a blank until recently, and as such, am attempting to write about the preservation of memories through genealogy and scrapbooking. Basically it's an "on the fly" essay. But I heard a guy in my class say he was writing about how to use a pencil, so maybe I don't feel so stupid. If he can come up with 3-4 pages of b.s. on that, I should be able to sum up acid free page protectors and the glorious world of Stickopotomas pretty easily.

      **FANFARE**  Yesterday's phrase: It's about time.  Dawn Kristen Myers and Andrew James Evert finally got married yesterday. It was a beautiful occation, and basically a West Valley reunion, which is fitting for the '99's 5th reunion from graduation. Several members of '01 were also on hand. The majority of us were in band together, and we spent the evening after the wedding and reception at a classmates' house reminicing. The rum and cokes flowed freely, which only made everything we said sillier. Dawn and Andy showed up for a while to see those that were departing cross country in the morning. Ah, I dearly love my classmates, and can appreciate our moments together despite our growing apart over the years. No matter where we go, and what we do, once in a great while we have a spectacular night of each other's company. Though high school was horrid in many respects, and we created a soap opera, we're bound to each other.

      The other day was a 6 a.m. call at the soda fountain, by 11 we were filming scenes for the girls' apartment, and then we hit Petco at 9 p.m. Long day...Ferrets are odd and smelly; I will never own one. Oh, and 3 hampsters in a wheel is hysterical.   Voice went well in-between there somewhere, and I have delighted Debra with my selections. She keeps threatening to steal my library of music.

      Wowzas. It's been a zany couple of shooting days. Of course, it would hit the hottest weather of the year during the week we film outside. This show would benefit from turning into a water ballet so we don't die of heatstroke. The morning sequences aren't that bad, as we've been gathering around 9. However, by the time the heat is searing and we've moved out to another location it's mid-afternoon and things begin to get sticky. Night shots are a blessing by comparison, though it's still muggy at 1 in the morning when we depart company. Long days make sleep that much more precious.

      Ah, don't you just love people? I just sang for church this morning, being a "young person", for Father's Day. I did the Eb version of The Lord's Prayer, which is nothing to sniff at with the high B. I didn't have any problems, of course, and thanked Jon profusely for accompanying me on the organ. (He's such a talented musician, and we're sooo lucky to have him here!)  Afterwards, I had a dozen or more people asking if I'd considered pursuing music as a career, or at least taking some local voice lessons. Being gracious and so forth, I informed them that I already was, but thank you for the compliment.

      So far...shots for fat kid/redneck; cheese/ice cream dream sequences; some Jim/Stan apt. finished. Have to reshoot dream sequences due to tech error. (Not my fault.) On a sidenote, the production gang is becoming more of a close-knit family. Jovial behavior increases with each shoot. Hugs are standard issue and mandatory prior to leaving. :) Not a bad idea for the world. More grumpy people would feel better with their daily dose of hugs. Lack of quota isn't good for anyone. Trees are substitutes...find something that hugs back whenever possible.

      What an insane couple of days. Rehearsals are now complete for production on "Missing The Mark" and shooting has begun. For the majority of those who have no idea what this means: basically the cast/crew live with each other for the rest of the month. We pop around, mainly just Yakima County, and have a grand time with each other. Some days are days...from 8am-8pm usually, with a few midnight shots thrown in-between. Oh yeah, and the one night of 10pm-4am. That'll be killer.  Technical difficulties are a regular occurrence, and we have to reshoot all of yesterday mornings' work because of a switch. Amilynn will owe me a new finger if I have to work on her dress again. (Kidding dear!) I never get used to the smoking and the language around set, although attending West Valley has desensitized me a bit. I just choose the higher road and don't follow their lead. It's amazing what a tight-knit group we are, what with several of us newbies this season. Josh was trying to keep me bored last night by hitting everything the same, take after take. Hey, if he's consistent and in the gist of the script, I am not going to complain. Communication between Josh and Tim and I is hysterical. As long as everybody's where they belong at the right time though, right? I may be the "script supervisor", but can tackle the intricate jobs of hair/makeup/wardrobe fairly well. And serving as the company gopher...I go fer this and go fer that. I was so exhausted after Brian took me home I ate and went straight to bed. It's bad when you have no memory of what you said, or did. This morning's better though, on all counts. Who brought in the sunshine?!

      * Bill and I went out yesterday afternoon for coffee. The guy cracks me up. Seems he'd never had an iced coffee before, and was unaware the Summitview Library is right behind the Chalet Starbucks. Revelations abounded. * Still have an A in English and Latin Ballroom...and this is the last week of class, so keep your fingers crossed that my last couple of projects due garner the same results. * Greg's last name is Maas. Finally got that info a couple of weeks ago. Not a very reliable dance partner lately. I went to Susie's and danced by myself anyway. Better to know my part so I can dance with anyone next week. Wallflower power...I have none! * Did a music video for " Missing the Mark " recently...it'll be on the cast/crew's DVD. I had to memorize the song " Behind Blue Eyes " in a couple of hours before doing my shoot, since everyone else had the lyrics earlier in the week when I was in school. Shooting begins next week for the film, and rehearsals have been going well. Bennett and I get along really well, which is good, since he's the Executive Producer and in charge of our paychecks. :) * Mom and Dad's  30th Anniversary  is today. Dad made dinner reservations for the whole family, but I have a presentation in English and can't be there. It just seems like yesterday, well almost, we had their 25th party with family and friends. Five years just flashed before my eyes; suddenly I feel old. * I've been an opera hound lately. Went to Portland for " The Marriage of Figaro " last November, and now we're on the list for all sorts of mailings, from Toronto even. Last month, we saw " The Barber of Seville " the night after I returned with Keira from Spokane's Musicfest. I had 4 days of non-stop road trip, plus a few miles of hiking in the Gorge and up to the Multnomah Falls crest. Whew! Then, I got a call less than 24 hours beforehand to go to Seattle Opera's " La Fennicula del West " and had free tickets...so Mom and I jumped at it for the next day's matinee. I wasn't impressed with the role of Minnie, well, her first aria anyway. Supposedly there's a C that is the plague of every soprano who plays the character...I must be desensitized or something since it never hit me I should be impressed. I was enthralled by the men's chorus of miners though. Sounded like I was in an English cathedral again. Flashbacks of 2001. But the best performance, by far, was the lead...the bandit. Italian men really know how to sing. His name is Antonio Polombi, and this was his American debut. He was flying back to Italy that night. I swear, he sounded just like Pavarotti. One of the other guys was off to Rome to do " Die Zauberflote "...I wanted to stow away in his luggage...I love that opera.  Anyway, I was told by the director to call his office for an audition. My voice teacher just looked at me when I told her and said,"Yes. Seattle, Portland, San Francisco. You're auditioning. Now impress me with your French." Somehow I still feel like the kid who just sang to entertain herself and her teddy bear audience. I never took any choir or voice class until after I'd been in college a few months. I know I'm on pitch, key, tone, etc. But now, I'm expected to teach beginning voice students and actually audition for professional companies??? I don't know how or why I can hit what I do, and the first time I was labeled a coloratura I gave a blank stare for a response. How was I to know what that meant? How in the world can I be expected to teach others, when I feel still like I've got nothing to offer and everything to learn? Life seemed much simpler 5 years ago. How did I go from wanting to teach kindergarten and get my masters, to doing Broadway and Julliard, to settling for any education so I can do opera, travel, and film? God's got some funky ways of working, and letting you know what's up. It's true that the yellow brick road has many paths. I think I'm taking roundabouts before "The One Road" appears. I have to finish my author presentation on O. Henry. He didn't have it easy either.

       Trip to Wenatchee       Just returned from Wenatchee...where by the way, it was about the hottest in the state...the unfortunate Hillis curse of bringing weather with us. It was Uncle Bob and Aunt Cathy's 25th Anniversary, which meant it was a family reunion on both sides with friends and neighbors adding to the mix. I had a lovely chat with my cousin Jeff's girlfriend, Emma, before they both dove into the pool with the rest of the kids. Kyle and David were lounging on the floatables between splashing. Kirsten kept going back and forth between groups. Ben, Karen and I sat poolside soaking up Jeff's belly-flops since we hadn't brought suits. Norm and Oliver were telling stories all day, trying to embarrass just about anyone. Aunt Karla, Uncle Jeff, Mom, Dad and I sought refuge from the setting sun under a canopy discussing automobile related issues since Ben and Karen and Kyle are at that imminent road-worthy age. ( Everyone look out...all of the Hillis' are on the   loose!)  The pictures were brought out from the wedding...complete with the requisite 1979 hair, fashion, and goofy looking family. Subsequent photos displayed us kids at our finest a decade later...we were all young and weird; what the heck happened? Ranging from 12-23, now were older and just as weird. :)

      Have you ever been at a party where you know people, not everyone though, and still you feel uncomfortable in a certain instance? Yeowzas. People have got to curb their tongues more often...at least  try  to consider the feelings of those around them. On a completely unrelated note ( yeah right !), ex-boyfriends...or rather boys in general are so damn insentitive. So for all the guys out there: when you're at a party with an ex-girlfriend present...or two as the case may be...don't go making comments about your dating life or asking for dating advice from said girls or with them in mixed company. It only complicates things and makes her feel invisible, devalued for the time you had together, and/or saying you had you didn't have a girlfriend but you do have " makeout buddies ". That implies that said girls weren't/aren't good enough in your eyes even for that. Rant terminated...off soapbox...return to original blog. Parties are an odd way of hanging out when you are determined to " do something ". As if just sitting around socializing isn't good enough once in a while. Guys' ideas of parties are warped way different than girls'. Then again, guys are just warped, period. Did I mention that the nunnery is looking good? ;-P

      Warm, warmer, and just plain hot. Without air conditioning. And no phone/internet.  Oh, yeah, did I mention  why  the neighborhood lost touch with the outside world? A neighbor who drives long-haul truck decided to park her cab  and  trailer on the street, which is not only illegal, but blocks sightlines for the corner. Usually she justs plants the trailer downtown somewhere and brings the cab home in her driveway. Another neighbor blew the whistle and called the cops on her to move it...which she did in a huff around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday evening. Suddenly breaks squeaked, a shudder went through the house, and power flickered off. I dashed outside in the backyard to see the lines and power pole dancing like a 7.0 earthquake had rocked us. Several lines were down along the fence at the back with a frayed end dangling off the pole, itself slightly off kilter. All around neighbors came running from in and outside...mowing the lawn, kids in the pool, digging in the garden. It seems Truck-lady didn't know how tall her trailer was, and whipped around into the lines, which hadn't been at regulation height in the beginning. After two days of a dozen orange vest clad guys hopping through our yards and shimmying up telephone poles for two blocks, we finally have things up and running again. No clue if any charges will be filed, or if there will be residual issues with the lines, or if our lines are now tapped.&nbsp;Kidding. Did I mention it's exceedingly on the warmish side?

       Oh Dear Lord! It is hot in ol' Yakima lately. Criminey, when the  low  temperature is over 80 it makes it hard to get any sleep...let alone stay comfortable in the daytime  highs  of triple digits. We've got warmer weather here than in Phoenix sometimes. Ah, the joys of having four distinct seasons.   Aunt Nancy and Erin came up for a few days from Boise to endure it with us. We trekked on up to the farm near Mount Adams on Friday, and ran into several familiar faces on Saturday at the Market and the Art Festival. Ann Woodruff and Betty Schmid were glad to see G'ma, Mom, and Nancy, and sorry to hear G'pa had passed. (I love the adorable little white Presbyterian church, Meyers' Grocery, and the old post office still standing...all of which is Main Street.)   I didn't go with Mom and Karen last year to the Festival, and didn't realize how big of an event it was. But, like Mom said, if it's advertised in the Yakima paper, it's got to be a big deal. I suddenly got overwhelmed by the commercialization and couldn't stop crying. It just emphasized the fact that I need to win the lottery in order to buy the farm back and restore it to a farm.  There have been several changes to the place, but I was thrilled to see one of Peanuts' horseshoes hanging in the barn near his hay mow. I know I never lived there, but I've lived vicariously through Mom enough to want those same experiences she had. And&nbsp;having folks from Seattle trapsing through the barn and turning the front yard into a parking lot was not part of her&nbsp;growing up. I think perhaps I despise change.  When we left, we ate lunch at&nbsp;The Logs and went to a couple of wineries enroute to home, which both had incredible views of Mount Hood and the&nbsp;Gorge, respectively. Now, the job hunt continues and it's back to the daily grind.       &nbsp;     July Announcements:        Happy Birthday    to the following people:  Kristen (Hyatt) Desgrossellier ,  Ben Stewart ,  Brianne Heath ,  Bob Hillis ,  Dawn   (Myers)   Evert ,  Nathan Skone ,  Michael Liddicoat . (Anyone I missed...I don't have you written down, so let me know!)  Also, pending   nuptial   hurrah to  Jason  and  Andrea  (Kunze) Stalder.

      Zip, Zilch, Nada, nothing going on for days/weeks/months and suddenly  *wham*  you don't have a spare minute to breathe. It all started on a dark and clear night last Thursday... Ok, enough melodrama. I've just been dashing to and fro as usual. Went to Ellensburg with Nate to Michael's apt for a movie. Next day chaos ensued: Nate got his wisdom teeth extracted; I turned in my resume for a job, and got an interview set up for later; Debra called to switch my voice time; Mike D. called after spending three hours trying to find my phone number(he's forgotten my last name); I had my voice lesson; went to my interview; was supposed to have my wrap party for the movie at Magic's Pizza, but nobody was there, so I went to Darigol's and had dinner with him and his dad. He left for Spokane and I went to check on Nate's condition before heading home. Saturday was the Sons of Norway picnic, where Helga had three of her nephews visiting. Of course, I ended up chatting with the musician out of the bunch (typical, I know). Then it was a dash out to Nile for Great Aunt Vi's 90th birthday and family reunion. Yesterday, it was dinner at Grandma's and a jaunt to the Folklife Festival to hear the band "Catch and Release" which Rich belongs to. Had the police show up after a woman in a blue van came inches away from running down a stroller and concertgoers at the front of the stage. Today, it's quieted down to the point that I'm excited about seeing the mailman just pull up to the box. Ah, life...the ultimate adventure.

      Happy Independence Day! I cannot remember a Fourth of July without wind; this is one of the more severe. The neighbors to the Northeast of us are lighting firecrackers with complete disregard for the law...imagine that. I had a late (or early) shoot at one of the casinos the other day. My cameos went surprisingly well and quick. Once again, I was able to utilize my wardrobe from high school, in using one of my dresses from our production of Grease!. I babysat the boys up the street but yesterday. Had a lovely time with cohorts from Selah the other day too. And had a grand time eating way too much food today. Oh, the walking I shall have to do subsequently. :)

      That's me. Haven't had that title in over four years, and my bank account is highly appriciative. I've already closed out my savings...and my checking is in the low double digits as we speak. Not that I want identity theft, but if it happened, they wouldn't get anything from poor little me. If anyone wants details, comment.

       Alrighty, I'm home from the beach. After returning Saturday from Wenatchee, the family went to Lincoln City for a couple of days of sand therapy. Dad  really  needed a getaway from work. Karen and I tried in vain to fly our kites, but wouldn't you know it, there was no wind at the beach! This trip ended up a " Wild America"  excursion for us, as we saw 3 cats and 4 raccoons at our motel, trillions of little fish or krill or whatever just hatched in the ocean, sea anemone, starfish, crabs, cormorants, herons, seagulls, whales, deer, and I even saw an eagle. Mom's birthday was Wednesday when we were returning home, and she wanted to stop at the Barnes &amp; Noble in Lloyd Center in Portland for a Vikings book. We were listening to Dad's new company car's satellite XM radio on the 50's station and chomping on salt-water taffy the entire ride. I returned home to find out that Rachel (Kunze) was coming home for a grand total of 36 hours before gallivanting off on her next adventure for the Fall. We proceeded to run errands and dink around on the computer, as well as chowing down on some New Thai for dinner while watching "Sweet Home Alabama". Got to do chick flicks at a time like that. :)    August Announcements:    For one...I gave my blog a makeover? What do you think...better than before??     Happy Birthday   to the following people:  Michael Darigol ,  Susan Hillis ,  Rachel Alvord ,  Damon Vanhee . (Anyone I missed...I don't have you written down, so let me know!)   Pending   nuptial   hurrah to  Ryan  and  Suzanne  (Beauchene) Heiberg

      Ah yes, Rachel and I are just having a swell time futzing around with our blogs. Thanks to her for an endorsement on her site. I never know if anyone is actually reading this thing besides her...since nobody   comments   or   signs   my     guestbook  !   You are the Aqua Marine Mermaid. You are pure and brave. Strong and True. Your best freind is your seahorse, your steed. You have fought many battles in your own life and in the sea. No matter what challenge you overcome it. Congratulations there are very few of you. Would you rate my quiz for I am brave too?   urlLink  What kind of mermaid are you? (Gorgeous Pics)    brought to you by
