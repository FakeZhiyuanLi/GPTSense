Well, it's not supposed to, this is spam.  I watched the latter half of an I Love the 80's Strikes Back marathon tonight.  I don't remember shit from the 80's, but the show is quite hilarious.  The people they choose to leave commentary on the different events of the decade just rules.  Chris Jericho, Boy George, Rich Eisen, The Donnas, Gilbert Gottfried, the guy who played the dad in Grounded for Life, and that one guy were all quite classic as they talked about how awesome or incredibly stupid X event was.  I'm considering skipping out on XBOX Live play for NCAA and Madden this year in favor of getting them for dirt cheap.  Come on now, if you had a choice to spend 100 bucks on the two games just to play online when you can end up getting dozens of games for 50, what would you do?  There's no way a normal person chooses to spend 100 bucks to have the original for online play over 50 bucks for several games.  The hair has been trimmed a bit so that Jan doesn't go nuts hating my hair for the Senior Pictures being taken Friday.  I don't like the look as of right now, but I'll stop caring by the time it grows back a tiny bit and looks more natural again by the time pictures roll around.  I've saved up some more money again.  It's just a matter of time before I blow it on something pointless.  I cannot decide if the NES GBA SP would be a pointless purchase or not.  I'm also debating whether to spend the money on games (as in possibly NCAA and Madden for online play, which reminds me, the XBL subscription runs out in June), a Nintendo DS when it comes out (like this specific amount of money will last until then), or continuing to save up for something random (like a Pocket PC where I could play random games on that thing for a long time).  Hell, I have no idea what to do with it.  The smart thing is to probably to deposit the money into my savings account and let it sit there, go get a job, and work to save up for some of those other things, then save up for a real vehicle (because let's face it, a Ford Windstar is pretty stupid).  Speaking of that vehicle, is it kinda odd that this household will have a Chevy minivan and a Ford minivan?  REVIEW WCW YAR

      I've had an interesting last 24 hours.  I went from running my fastest 40 ever, to seeing a light show (as in lightning) on the way to graduation, saw a few friends graduate at Schuster, drove home in a downpour on the highway, found that the place Nate picked to eat at was closed, went home and slept.  That's just yesterday through to when I slept.  I ran a 4.81 40 yd dash.  I was pumped.  I am apparently .04 seconds faster than our starting quarterback.  Give the fucking ball to number fifty five is what I say.  Schuster is huge, but Osgood thinks that we need a bigger place for graduation.  Schuster may not hold as many as he'd like, but it's amazing.  It's not like I really need 8 tickets anyways.  Between my brother and I, we will get about 16 tickets total for next year's graduation.  I can only think of 2 that are used by my parents off hand.  Guess I can raise some tuition money at that point by selling the remaining tickets.  Of course, this is only if we graduate at Schuster.  It is apparently 3 times as expensive at Memorial Hall was.  My mother was sad to hear that, but Mrs. Hilliard told us we could have it at Schuster next year if enough of our parents call in to the Big Red Dog and demand to have it at Schuster.  I plan on doing that, as it would be awesome to have graduation there next year.  Nate looked really out of place in his cap and gown.  I would be sad that he's graduating, except he's going to Wright State.  The other friend of mine that graduated was Libby, except she's moving to Grand Rapids in June.  Guess I'll never see her again.  Speaking of her, I had a really cryptic dream last night involving her and I have no fucking clue what it means.  I was in my family room and my mother said something about the Horoscopes in the paper and she needed to know what section they were in (Libby used to read them in the office), and Libby kept mouthing to me, "Tell her," so I tell my mother they're in the life section and then I continued rambling on about it and then.... I am awaken by my mother to wake up as it's 6:00 am.  Fuck, what the hell did that mean?  School is winding down now.  I need a 54% to keep an A in Chemistry, a 50% to do the same in History, and I have no clue what is going on in Algebra III right now involving my grade, but I think I need about a 78% to keep an A in there (which can be done easily with my Math god status).  I'm considering not studying at all for my History final, mainly because of the low grade needed on the exam for the grade desired.  So I'm sitting in the office, bored as usual.  C lunch starts and a random freshman walks in to serve a detention (I guess lunch detentions were in the main office today).  Guess who the next person to walk in the door is.  Go ahead, guess.  Come on, if you knew Jeff this year, you probably know who it is, to make such a big deal out of it.  Jade walks in.  She apparently doesn't have an alarm clock and has been late one too many times.  Random exchange takes place soon after:  Jeff: When you walked in, I could just feel my face turn bright red Jade: Why? Jeff: You know why.  I certainly wasn't expecting that.  Random smiling is exchanged, as the other freshman in to serve a detention just looks at me weird.  Yeah fuck you too.  What's the deal with Terrell.  Why has every girl he's been romantically involved with this year from WCHS has been a freshman?  I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the big black guy stereotype.  Is Terrell praying on the freshmen?  Perhaps.  What about next year, will he get bored with the class of 2007 and move on to the class of 2008?  Fucking sicko.  Apparently the leader of the 4th Reich did not like Eric Becker's speech at the ERA awards back on Tuesday.  Heaven forbid we should have a funny speech break up the monotony (sp?) of the usual ERA awards.  I know for a fact that people like Gehron and Schoenberger laughed at it, as did everyone else in that auditorium, well, besides Millie.  While it has been expressed many times by Kyle, this is getting rediculous.  Unfortunately, I've got a vibe from her that she wants me to be next year's Andy Lewis.  For those not in the know (which you probably are in the know anyways), Millie likes to praise Andy constantly for how great he is and how we should all be just like him.  Heck, at graduation, she went out of her way to praise him because he wasn't a Valedictorian or Saluditorian, so she had to praise him as the greatest Student Body President of all time, while she ignores the other president, Kyle.  Just on a tangent here, line of the night has to come from Kyle, as he mentioned in his speech an experience being in Jason Vanover's basement arguing with friends whether Shawn Michaels or Goldberg was better.  I wish I was able to become a Kyle Johnson mark sooner that I had.

      I'm making a post in the freaking morning for the hell of it now.  The way I see it, I'll post to this thing 3-4 times a day before letting it fade into obscurity like the Xanga.  Although people are still calling me Peff Zatterson.  What the hell is the deal with that anyways?  People like to think they're cool by calling me Peff Zatterson when only 3 or 4 people actually know what the hell it means.  Por ejemplo, Joseph Patton.  He started calling me the name and I asked him if he knew what it meant.  Joe apparently did not know.  He's such a wannabe Jeff hater.  ERA was the other night, including a speech by an Eric Becker which had parents praising him for how funny he was.  To me, it was just more of Becker.  Apparently, a parent didn't like the speech because she thought he said, "Well, Miss Black says this is boring so....."  This was not the case.  Some parents are just really stupid and don't know the kids at all.  The Pace story told by Beck was quite classic though.  Man, after reading some of that old Xanga stuff I wrote, I can't see how I wrote so much on every little random subject I could.  I mean, I could chug out a page of my opinion on shoveling snow.  Was I just really bored?  Maybe.  Nowadays, it seems like I'm only able to write a short paragraph on any given subject besides any one subject that really pisses me off rather than the whole page I could go before.  Maybe it was the fact that a lot of the posts last December were done semi-late at night.  Maybe I was so tired that I was somehow able to just keep going and going and going.  That reminds me of a certain anecdote:  Nate told me once something that Brodehl told him that was really stupid.  Now, Nate was one of Brodehl's favorite players, mainly because he went full speed all the time even though he got his ass kicked every play.  I believe this was around Nate's Sophomore year, but Brodehl said he called Nate Duracell because he keeps going and going.  Of course, Duracell was the wrong battery.  It was Engergizer he should've likened Nate to.  Nate found this funny, and so did many.  Brodehl was crazy, but not as crazy as this year will be.  We currently only have something like 10 2-a-days scheduled, as compared to something like 18 last year.  Chad brought up a good point though, it'll be 10 2-a-days of Brigati kicking our asses for a good part of each day.

      Here is a post on my Xanga from December 23, 2003:  It's almost Christmas once again.  A time to ask for hundreds of dollars worth of presents from family and friends.  A time to be as greedy or as giving as you feel like.  As usual, I leaned toward the greedy side.  Hey, at least I don't fill you with bullshit saying that I'm not materialistic when I am.  The following is a rundown of the gifts Jeff is knowing/hoping that he will receive on that magical Christmas morning (complete with description of the size of the package):  The humongous box containing the gift Jeff knows he is getting: A stereo.  I have no place to put this thing.  I tried planning out how it would go into my room, but I couldn't come up with a conceivable way to fit it in my room with the stuff I have now.  So Jan (the official mother of Jeff Patterson) came up with the wacky idea of phasing out my dresser, getting a big shelf contraption, and putting my tv, games, stereo, etc. on it.  But what becomes of the clothes within the dresser?, you ask.  Well, Jan also came up with the idea of cleaning out my closet and putting shelves in there for clothes.  The pain in the ass doors of the closet would be gone in favor of a curtain, allowing easier access to my closet.  I guess contained within each of these gift's section will be quasi-random thoughts to go along with it.  Moving on...  The slightly larger than normal DVD sized present that Jeff knows he is getting: Simpsons Season 1 DVD set.  Best Buy had an insane sale on this on Black Friday (Friday after Turkey Day) where the Simpsons Season 1 DVD was only 12 bucks or something like that.  Jan, the saint that she is, went there on Black Friday and waited in a line for an HOUR AND A HALF before she could get to the checkout.  God Bless her.  So although the 1st season of the Simpsons wasn't that great, how the hell can you pass up a chance to get the whole set for the first season for 12 bucks?  Exactly  The flat square-ish shaped gift:  I'm going to guess some random calendar.  The previous two years, I did not get a calendar going in my room for a long time.  Two years ago, I didn't get a calendar in my room until February.  This year, I do not believe I had a calendar in my room until July.  So I'm guessing that would be the logic in getting Jeff a calendar for Christmas.  I have no clue whatsoever what the topic of the calendar could be.  It could be Simpsons.  It could be a hot chick calendar (yeah, like Jan would ever get that for Jeff).  It could be Cincinnati Bengals.  It could be Microsoft.  Hell, it could be a fuzzy hamster calendar for all I know.  Humongous box:  I'm going to guess an office chair.  I questioned Jan about it and she asked me what I thought it was.  I said office chair.  Jan says I'm wrong.  I think she was just trying to swerve me on that one.  Scott also happens to have a humongous box as one of the gifts.  It wouldn't surprise me if the parents Patterson got office chairs for their sons, considering the fact that we've been sitting in crappy chairs at computers for years now.  Have you seen the shitty yellow-orange chair?  Have you heard the shitty yellow-orange chair?  Should Jeff start referring to the chair as the SYOC?  Do you know how many chairs Scott and I broke back when we shared that Gateway?  We broke all the chairs to that set ourselves.  That's how much we sat in those chairs.  I think this section is now completely devoid of interesting material.  Random Thoughts:  So after I predicted a marathon KOTOR session, I played all of 3 hours, but that's ok.  I finally got off the first planet and was able to build myself a badass yellow lightsaber.  I hope to be able to gain another lightsaber to kick some serious (insert random Star Wars enemy here) ass.  I've played no NCAA yet, but I may have to play some here soon.  Junior Lott is the most incredible QB ever for me in the game.  In one game he was able to throw off his back foot and hit his receiver in perfect stride 40 yards downfield.  I started to stray from the highly efficient offense of doom and I started playing out of the shotgun more.  All I ended up doing was find about 7 or 8 effective plays in the 2 shotgun formations provided to me to create an even more powerful highly efficient offense of doom.  People planning to play Jeff in NCAA beware.  I swear, no one will ever beat me in this game.  I'm 102-0.  I'm the Goldberg of NCAA, and I do not plan on finding anyone who is the Kevin Nash equivalent anytime soon.  Man, I'm such a geek. Reminds me of a quote from the Treehouse of Horror this season in The Simpsons from Professor John Frink: "Mother says father and I got along like positrons and anti-neutrinos. (wacky Frink sounds) Yes, I am a geek."  Dude, I had the most classic conversation ever with another Ferg sympathizer.  For the sake of not revealing his identity, let's call him "Ron Stoppable"  Ron's girlfriend apparently contacted me in a rage over the generic comment the other day, and spewed insults at me.  I countered by trying to explain my situation, but it was hopeless.  So Jeff went into "wacky Jeff Patterson" mode, thus pissing her off further.  So she said to Ron that I was not too kind to her, and he decided to start a "friendly" conversation with me in AIM, the following is the conversation (with Ron's screen name conveniently replaced with his "for the sake of his identity" name):  RON: hey faggot  RON: this is Ron Stoppable and i have some shit to say to you  Schill ISclassic: ok?  RON: first you dont say shit to my girlfriend and then you dont say ferg was generic  Schill ISclassic: listen  RON: how are you going to talk shit o tmy girlfriend and then think your cool   Schill ISclassic: i didn't start the conversation  RON: first of all you dont have a clue who the fuck your tlaking to so dont say listen to me  Schill ISclassic: and i didn't call ferg generic  RON: well you said his xanga thign was generic  Schill ISclassic: yes, but so are 90% of the xanga's out there  RON: ok well your is about queer you have a picture of a nintendo in the picture part  RON: if you ask me that is as gay as it gets  Schill ISclassic: i was basically saying ferg has more of a personality than what was there and that it should be reflected in his xanga  Schill ISclassic: and you can't tell me you didn't like the NES  RON: dude why the fuck would you go off on my girlfriend last ngiht nd say all this shit  RON: to her  Schill ISclassic: i said nothing offensive to her  RON: if i see my name pop up in ur xanga you will be hearing from em u have no reason to put me in the xanga  RON: well i am just making sure that you didnt  Schill ISclassic: from who?  RON: i said if you put me in there like you put my girlfriend so if i was you i would take her out of it right now  Schill ISclassic: i tried to explain my position, but she didn't give a chance to explain  Schill ISclassic: so i went into wacky jeff patterson mode  RON: well your wacky jeff  patterson mode is alittle gay  Schill ISclassic: it's classic  RON: not really  Schill ISclassic: i'd say so  RON: why would you try to insult peoplewith words you dont even know the meaning of  Schill ISclassic: what words did i use?  Schill ISclassic: generic?  RON: nope  RON: i dont kno let me send you the conv.  Schill ISclassic: excellent  RON: welp when you learn to not talk shit i will talk to you again but untill then dont let me hear you are talking shit again  RON: bye  Schill ISclassic: this was only semi classic  RON: what  Schill ISclassic: may there be more classic aim convo's in the future  RON: are  you still talkign shit  RON: talking*  Schill ISclassic: REVIEW WCW SPELLIGN ERRRORSS  RON: dude i swear you have got to be the gayest kid i have ever met  Schill ISclassic: i'm sorry, but your girlfriend never let me explain my situation  RON: and if you bring dj and drew over to my house and do shit then i swear to god i will beat all ur asses  Schill ISclassic: i tried to explain the reasoning behind the generic comment  Schill ISclassic: not that i remember where you live  RON: what was the generi comment  RON: welp if my house comes up and there is shit done to it then i will be at ur house  RON: my house or my truck  Schill ISclassic: i called two of ferg's xanga posts generic, i was unaware that that was so horrible  RON: so you guys better hope nothing happens  Schill ISclassic: i'm sorry, i should cower in fear of Ron Stoppable and his calves  RON: well you better hope i dont see you in the near future   Schill ISclassic: let me go sit in the corner and write "i will not call xanga posts generic" 100 times on a paper  Schill ISclassic: i sorry  RON: come on over and do some time and do somehting instead of talking hsit on the computer  RON: bye  Schill ISclassic: ooooooooooooooooooooo  Schill ISclassic: OWN3D  RON: dude you have to be the biggest douche bag ever  Schill ISclassic: dude, it's called the internet  Schill ISclassic: what does the internet matter  Schill ISclassic: i'm wacky on the internet and say wacky things, ooooo big deal  RON: welp hopw about you come on over and say shit to my face   RON: o thats right you dont have the balls  Schill ISclassic: i have no beef with out  Schill ISclassic: beef with you*  RON: you can ony hide behind the computer  Schill ISclassic: i have no beef with anyone  RON: well i do because you were talking shit about my girlfriend  Schill ISclassic: i didn't talk shit about her  RON: calling her a "randon ferguson fan"  Schill ISclassic: is that an insult?  Schill ISclassic: i really don't know  RON: no but still you dont have to say shit behind someones back  RON: say it to there face  Schill ISclassic: but i don't see any of these people anyways  RON: because noone likes you so they dont go around you  Schill ISclassic: good  Schill ISclassic: less time to be around the stupid kids  RON: ur right   RON: dude i gotta go   RON: see ya douche bag  Schill ISclassic: dude, ok  Schill ISclassic: may there be more classic aim chats in the future  RON: i swear to god you have to be the gayest kid i have ever met  Schill ISclassic: i swear to god, you have to be the most GENERIC kid i ever met  Schill ISclassic: REVIEW WCW OWN3D  RON: well i will be at your house in about 10 minutesa  Schill ISclassic: ok  Schill ISclassic: see you soon  I may not have won that one, so we'll call it about even.  Suffice to say, 10 minutes went by and I had not heard from him.  I'm assuming Ron will be giving me lots of crap for putting this in here, seeing as how he yelled about it not going into the xanga, but hey, what can you do?  There's no way to keep people from doing what they want with the conversations from AIM.  Ah, gotta love Xanga.  It has gotten many interesting WC people to send me messages with love such as "faggot", "shithead", etc.  This is why I love the internet.

      It's apparently taking Derek a bit longer to get posting to the blog I've created him.  Maybe it would've been easier for him to just create something himself.  It probably would have, but he's *this close* to posting this stuff on the internet.  Of course, no one will read besides me and him and whoever he gives the link to.  I suppose I should do a Xanga-esque post here soon, maybe I'll post the highlight of my Xanga here for all to see once again.

      I can apparently accept users to post on this blog so that it isn't just Jeff posting to it.  I could theoretically give access to my clique and see what wacky things they post.  It'd be funny.  I know no one will take me up on this offer, but if anyone should want to post to this thing, contact me via AIM at Jeff Is Classic.  Should anyone take me up on the offer, the name of the Blog would be changed.  Also, feel free to proverbially spit in my face and say such classic lines as, "ur gay" and "im n idot i r ron stoppable"

      Anyone constantly refresh the page for Family Guy quotes and find that the quotes are a bit limited?  So I'm the only one.  I notice no one actually comments on my posts about the subject matter of the posts, but rather they comment on playing some tennis.  Now, I'm all for playing some tennis, but I'm desperate for comments and such, which is probably why I'm still even bothering posting in the Xanga rather than exclusively (like anyone would care) at the Blogger site.  Random Observation(s): Will Griffey ever hit his 500th?  Is Linder ordering him not to hit a homer to spike attendance?  If Griffey doesn't hit the 500th for a month, when do the crowds start dying down?  How long until he gets hurt again?  Are rhetorical questions back?  Is my nipple lactating? If I was awarded the Outstanding JV Player award in tennis, who got it in girls' tennis?  Should I start a new paragraph?  People used to enjoy rhetorical questions, right?  Is it possible to be nostalgic for something from 6 months ago?  I've just received something for a Radio survey of some sort.  I apparently get $4.00 USD for it.  Whoo!  Now if I only had this money earlier.  I bought Golden Sun: The Lost Age for the GBA earlier today as another game to indulge in on the roadtrip to Michigan this weekend to get the Damn Vaninator.  If I had these four dollars earlier, I could have gotten Warioware, which would have probably been a much better investment.  More on this later.  Back to the subject at hand, I'm going to just take my $4 and go home.  Oh wait, I am home.  WOOHOO!  I now have $6, count em, SIX, dollars.  Ok, so back to the game.  I bought the 2nd Golden Sun game.  I can't believe someone actually traded this in.  I found two game saves, both with over 70 hours worth of gameplay on it.  Now, If I played a game over 145 hours, I would hold a certain sense of attachment to the game.  I would never be able to trade such a game in for such a small amount of store credit.  While talking to the GameStop guy, I learned of a new store opening in some East-something (I can't remember the name) Shopping Center.  Anybody know the name and the general location of the place?  I plan on applying to the place, hoping that my superior game knowledge can make up for the fact that I've never worked in retail before.  The guy working at the time was a manager of the new place and was quite nice, which is different compared to the assholes that normally work there.  I've also applied to Best Buy, so maybe I can start working soon and earn some freaking money to go to the million thousand things I want to buy (TV series DVD's, car stuff for the mp3 player, eventually a PDA, etc.).  I've now puked in two consecutive workouts and I can't figure out why the hell I've done so.  I don't think I'm in that bad of shape from not doing anything for about 2 weeks.  Maybe it's a psychological thing.  At least then I could give myself some kind of excuse for why the hell I'm puking.  Then again, I've also violated my personal rules each day for not eating anything in the hour and a half before the workout, so maybe I'll just eat a lot for dinner Thursday night, not eat breakfast, and we'll see where that goes.  I haven't played any Golden Sun tonight, the Reds are comfortably ahead in the 9th, and Griffey won't be hitting his 500th tonight.  So now I retire from typing up this post.  This is Jeff, and this blog is like the Premium version of my blogging (as in no ads for another site).  Only without any kind of fees for the viewing of this blog, because that would just be wrong.

      Monday was kinda insane.  Woke up bright and early at 5:41, showered, then left to take Jan to work and off to workouts.  Terrell had asked me the previous night to pick him up beforehand, so I went there.  After not getting a response for about a minute, I left in disgust that he had not come to the door.  Brigati starts us off saying insane things, we warm up, and we divide into 4 groups.  There were 4 stations that all kicked my ass.  Bench and military press, squat and straight leg DL, crazy leg machine squat thingie and leg curl/extentions, and what was supposed to be medicine balls.  Funny thing about that, the locks were changed and we had no access to these medicine balls, so we had to do all the motions without the help of medicine balls.  I'm sure we looked really stupid doing it, but all of us were on the brink of puking or having already puked so no one paid much attention to how stupid it looked.  We closed off workouts running forward and backward and shuffling side to side for something like 15-20 minutes.  It made no sense, but I'm hoping Brigati knows what he's doing.  At some point in time during this running, I decided that I might punch my next door neighbor in the face if he insults my coach again like he has the last few months.  As we finish up, I learn that Terrell is ineligible (at this point, I'm thinking that's why he didn't show at his door) and Brigati quotes Conan the Barbarian (starring Ahnuld).  Day goes on, and I talk to Terrell online.  Had one of the most unnerving chats on the internet ever with him.  It's going to be different this year without him to say the least.  If Terrell wasn't so pissed about this (like I'm sure anyone with his size and potential would be), I'd make a joke, but I'll refrain.  Didn't do much of anything today besides getting fitted for contacts.  They are now ordered and they should be in around 5 days from now.  Guess that means next week as 5 days from now is Sunday.  By then, I'll be driving the Damn Vaninator (if I may steal a term from an internet columnist you have never heard of) and I'll be going in to figure out how the heck to put them in and out.  Should be most helpful for such things as football and tennis because I didn't wear my glasses during these sports, well now I should be able to see for once.  Random note:  does anyone else around here have a spidey sense about wacky things?  For example, I think I just heard Scott come upstairs with a bag of chips that I was saving for this weekend's road trip to the grandparents.  I can't confirm that it's my food, but let me go check.  ....................................  Guess what, I was competely right.  Gotta love wacky spidey senses.  Other wacky Jeff spidey senses include: knowing when someone has just walked into my room (even though said person came in silently and I could be listening to music at a high volume and still notice the person), knowing when an impending deal on a DVD is about to show up.  For example, I made a list of the DVD Box sets I need to eventually pick up, vowing not to pay more than $30 for each one.  Within the next week, I am able to pick up Futurama Vol. 2 and 3 for $30 each.  Boo ya.  And yes, I would like to be a wacky black guy on Sportscenter, reporting from the NBA Finals, and have a wacky lazy eye.  www.jeffisclassic.blogspot.com  Is that some kind of subliminal message?  www.jeffisclassic.blogspot.com  Maybe.  Reminds me of a Family Guy episode (need to pick up those DVD's too).  Peter starts talking to someone working for a tobacco company about subliminal messages.  The show cuts away to show an old fashioned looking show and every few seconds, the show cuts to a tobacco company CEO saying, "SMOOOOOKE!"  Gotta love Family Guy.  Does anyone out there know of a good fan site for the show with awesomely classic quotes?  I want to be able to quote Family Guy in everyday life.  Peter: I'm going to get my kids something special, and I don't mean special like that Smith kid down the street.  No, it's going to be special, like SPECIAL K.  Hey, what do they do with the regular K?  And for that matter, whatever happened to K Ballad?  You know, if you had a cold and you said Mallad, it'd sound like Ballad. Brian: Do you ever listen to yourself when you speak? Peter: I drift in and out.  This is Jeff, and I want to be special like Special K  www.jeffisclassic.blogspot.com  www.jeffisclassic.blogspot.com  www.jeffisclassic.blogspot.com  www.jeffisclassic.blogspot.com  www.jeffisclassic.blogspot.com  Edit: I forgot to add some wacky game reviews from the flip card.  Panzer Dragoon Orta: B-  I must say I was quite disappointed when I played this game.  From what I've heard of the game being so awesome, I came away after playing not being that impressed.  I guess it doesn't really matter how you spruce everything up, it's still essentially a rail shooter.  With really annoying controls.  Ninja Gaiden: B.  Fucking difficult to the point that I had to resort to using codes of some kind about 5 minutes into playing it because I didn't feel like dying really often.  There are some questionable camera angles that you get stuck with for a brief time while playing, costing you precious life because you'll be stuck on the corner of a room when an enemy ninja starts slicing you with his katana.  Frustration, aggrevation on the sidelines.......Not quite as great as everyone makes it out to be, but it's still fun to slice an enemy into the air and continue slashing as long as you can keep him up in the air.  Note: this felt like a port of the Xanga version of the post.  Note: I need to drop the Xanga  Note/question: Why won't everyone else drop Xanga's when there are such superior blogging sites out there?  Note: Why is everything a Xanga rather than a Blog now?  Note: Has XBOX replaced Playstation as the generic term for video games, or was it just Brigati?  Note: It is probably still Playstation for the time being.

      Because you know you want to know...........  I got to wake up bright and early at 6:00am this morning (ugh) and I got to eat what I think might be my first hot breakfast at six in the morning ever.  I then had to depart for Wright State for the ACT.  I arrive at Wright State and walk up to the door of Rike Hall.  I see a piece of paper attached to the door.  I think, "It must say something stupid along the lines of 'Welcome ACT Testers.'"  It actually says, "ACT testing moved to 108 Oelman.  Fuck.  Luckily for me, a couple confused onlooking fellow test takers must have been pitiful enough for a student to tell us what direction the place was in.  Hmm, I don't think I'm going to tell the story I meant to tell in the full language I meant to, so how bout the short form.  Stolen Gimmick:  Short Form: Rest of Jeff's Saturday  Oelman hall was cold, glad I brought a sweatshirt.  Yay!  I sat in the front row of a Wright State classroom for the test.  Neutral yelling sounds!  I took the test on the smallest surface I have ever had to deal with on a desk.  Boo!  I let them know in the questionaire thing afterwards my distate for small desks.  Yay!  I was reading an interesting story on Honeybees in the reading section when, "YOU HAVE 5 MINUTES REMAINING, 5 MINUTES."  AHHHHHHHHHHH.  Boo!  Didn't understand a whole lot of the science section.  Boo!  I still give myself a Patented Miss Black Shoulder Scale number of 4 (out of 5).  Yay!  I get the results in 4-7 weeks.  Boo!  Played games against Derek.  Yay!  Derek sucked at all the games I played him at except for a game of ESPN NFL Football and the trivia mini-game hidden within.  Boo!  Derek is the worst Super Mario Bros. 3 Player ever.  Hell, he can't be called a player of the game either, he's a never-was and never-wanted-to-be.  Boo!  Ice Cream is sounding really good right now, at about midnight.  Yay!  Scott ate an entire package of Oreos today before I knew there were Oreos.  Boo!  Scott ate an entire box (=about 3 regular containers of Oreos) during the course of last weekend.  By the time I felt like eating some (Sunday), they were gone.  Boo at the past!  REVIEW WCW SHORT FORM MIGHT BE DONE

      I've had the Mock Critical Incident the last two days.  I now have all my service hours in for NHS this upcoming year.  Those hours aren't due until April.  It was pretty wacky what we would do each time.  Basic setup, we tried to create a panic around some cops and they tried to handle the situation.  There was a police officer with a paintball gun that would go around for a while, then he would hide in Hilliard's room and it was up to the cops to find him in there while cascading through several rooms in the 100's.  Unfortunately, a lot of the cops screwed up big time and the "shooter" got the cops several times, I'd say at least half the time.  They might have to do this again as soon as possible because those officers are not prepared at all.  There was a lot of free time in between the simulations, so there was a ton of food to be eaten and volleyball to be played.  Some of the volleyball games got pretty damn insane.  A lot of kids were also hit square in the head with volleyballs gone astray.  I believe one girl had marks on her face from the lines on the ball.  I know I got hit at least once, I think, that is, if I can remember anything from today after that hit.  There was a drawing afterwards for various prizes.  2 PS2's and an XBOX were given away.  The PS2's both went to people of the female gender, which I find both funny and annoying.  At least one of them will actually play it, while the other will probably pawn it off for cash for college.  At the end, they were trying to get everyone a prize.  People who hadn't won anything yet put their name tags in a box and they started drawing for the unclaimed prizes.  Near the end, Mrs. Parsons looked through the nametags, picked mine out, and gave me a hat.  Working in the main office ruled.  In other news, first tennis lesson at Wilson was Wednesday.  There were all of 4 people.  I can't decide if I feel really out of place or not.  Then again, I was practically the only person in shape there.  At least if I get anything out of it, I'll be able to put some top spin on all my shots and I'll have a better serve motion.  Speaking of top spin...  I finally beat Top Spin Wed. night.  I beat Lleyton Hewitt in straight sets (to 3) 3-1, 3-1.  I went fucking nuts after I finally beat him.  That was a solid 6 months of practicing off and on at the game to finally beat him.  Top Spin is the hardest fucking tennis game I've ever played.  Maybe I'll update later with other random thoughts, but I've been typing this off and on for the last hour or so (mostly off), so I need to end it for now.

      After spending most of the day trying to get XBOX Live to freaking work (damn you Microa$$, I will expound on this later), I went to the tennis banquet, taking place almost a month after the season actually finished.  I can now say I am something you're not.  I have been given the highest honor of an award....as a JV tennis player.  I have been named the 2004 West Carrollton High School Outstanding JV Player.  How many of you out there can say that you have been given such a prestigious award?  Yeah, that's what I thought.  Busy day tomorrow, as I have to wake up at 5:15, take my mother to work, go to the Mock Critical Incident, pick up a GBA SP, pick my mother up, and I've got the first of 4 or 5 tennis lessons at Wilson.  Such fun, but that Classic SP is bitchin' (if I may violate my own rules and use shitty slang).

      I guess I'm going to bother screwing with both of my blogs at this point, seeing as how I have reached the summer and it means that I have very little to do for long periods of time either because friends are gone, or I'm stuck near my house due to lack of vehicles.  So I present you, the Xanga/Blogspot reader, the first ever Jeff Patterson, SIMULCAST BLOG POST.  Yes, you heard it right, this is the first time I will be posting to both blogs at roughly the same time.  It will be all the excitement of a regular blog times two.  Ok, maybe not times two if I just post the same thing on both blogs, but whatever.  A lot has occurred in the last week or so since I last had a real post to the Blogspot, been even longer since the last post in the Xanga.  Let's see if I can go day-by-day (if I can remember each day) with the recaps:  Mon, May 31 (Memorial Day): All I remember is sitting around wasting time on the internet.  Always nice to have a day where I sit around and do as little as possible, especially when I should have been studying.  Tue, June 1: Last day of school before finals started Wed.  I went through my mind about a thousand times trying to figure out what I needed to study and if I would study at all.  Got home, ended up not studying at all.  I didn't even open my bookbag after I got home.  Wed, June 2: First day of finals.  2nd and 4th period finals were issued by my teachers.  2nd period was History, which despite not studying outside of school, I managed to get a 96% on the final.  I believe it was the 2nd highest grade on the final.  I finished with a 99% overall in the class.  Take that.  4th period exam was Algebra III.  Hardest exam I took this semester.  I still ended up getting a 91/99, which was about a 92% on the thing, but I was told by Miss Black that not that many people did well, so she would probably curve it, giving Jeff an even higher grade.  Boo ya.  Got home, wasted time and did nothing until I went to sleep (no studying again).  Thursday, June 3:  2nd day of finals.  1st and 3rd period exams were given.  1st period exam was Chemistry.  I found out I got a 94% on the thing, and pumped my fist in the air (not really).  I was relieved to have all of my exams over with (GRAMMAR ERROR FROM JEFF, OMFG BAN HIM NOW D00D!!1111).  Ate lunch, as I proceeded to ingest nothing but Ritz Chips and Sierra Mist for the duration of the 45 minutes that was lunch.  I walked into the office for the last 2 hours of the year to hear that the school was robbed.  Jesus Christ.  Apparently, a kid donned a ski mask, took ten dollars (yes, that is right, he stole all of $10.00 American) from the Cafeteria cash register and ran.  Jeff the janitor (want to make some jokes about it, go ahead) chased after him all the way to that creek over by Schnell.  The kid was later found hyperventilating in a laundry room for the apartments in the area.  What a fucking dumbass.  Way to fucking go, Jimmy Berridge.  REVIEW WCW VIOLATION OF THE WHAT GOES ON IN HERE STAYS IN HERE RULES OF THE MAIN OFFICE.  I spent the next 2 hours doing what I did in the office all year.  I got to ring the bells as the "final exam."  Way to go office people.  Channel 7 showed something on the robbery at the end of their 12 O'Clock news and then a flood (and by flood, I mean 5 or 6 people) called in, worried about a robbery at the school.  Goddamn parents, give it a rest.  And for that matter, come on now local news affiliates.  Don't you have something better to cover than report on a kid taking all of ten bucks from the school?  I mean, I could understand if someone ran in the school armed and robbed the cafeteria, but a student just ran up and took 10 bucks and ran.  Give me a fucking break.  With school over and done with for the year, I eventually tracked down Terrell and we played some games against each other and Andy Ooten (coolest last name ever), as we all realized that we sucked at the games we grew up playing (as in Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, and 3).  I also picked up a games flip pass (3 months of having a game rented and out with no late fees, well, until the 3 months are up) and rented Full Spectrum Warrior, only to find that it sucks.  Friday, June 4:  Senior pictures time.  I brought good friends Terrell and Derek with me for the group picture, as we met Drew and Nate there to take group pictures.  Took the group pictures next to that old truck, a picture in B&W and a few in color.  Rest of the pictures went fine, as Terrell and Derek stuck around, seeing as how I was the transportation for them.  I have a really bad forced smile, so Terrell kept doing wacky things in the background to get a better smile for the picture.  These things included: Picking his nose, scratching himself, making a motion of feeling up a girl, and saying wacky things.  After my pictures were done, I took a few with Scott in the garden for my mother and we were off back for the homestead Patterson.  We then played some games after trading FSW in for PGR2 (gotta love the initialed names).  While taking Derek home, I found that Terrell had SATs the next day, so he had to go home also.  Spent the rest of the night playing PGR2 until 1:30am.  Sat, June 5: I was awakened by Van at about 11:15am to find that I had a phone call.  The conversation went something like this: Me: Hmm? (kinda sounded like hello, but I had just woken up) Jan: Hello Me: Hmm. Jan: We're out of soap at the car wash, could you come down here with the Dawn? Me: mm-hmm. Jan: See you in a bit Me: hmm. (kinda sounded like bye, but again, tired)  I throw on a shirt, shorts, and a hat and run down to the car wash half asleep.  I'm there by 11:27.  Jan says, "You look like you just woke up."  Maybe it's because I did.  I'm told at that point that they desperately need help since no one showed up for the 11-1 shift for the car wash.  I wash a car or two, and my mom bugs me about my drowsy state again.  At least that 3 or 4 minute conversation then gave me a chance to kinda wake up, and Hatch defended my right to be in a drowsy state at 11:30 in the morning.  I proceed to wash cars for the next 3 hours, then everyone who was at the car wash from me on earlier (in terms of showing up) stops working and sits around drinking pop, bullshitting, and eating pizza.  Good times, good times.  I don't remember much about the rest of Saturday, other than the fact that I returned PGR2 for Tiger Woods 2004.  Oh yeah, I played Derek some in the game also, destroyed him thoroughly (by 12 strokes or so), played a few more random games, including a classic match of Top Spin (made classic by me taking most of the match easy).  Drew showed up with HD trouble and I couldn't help him a whole lot, so we went to his house and stared at his computer for 10 minutes before saying screw it and decided to play some street football.  I was definitely the MVP of that street football.  BS'ed the rest of the night, played a little more Tiger Woods, then went to sleep.  Sun, June 6:  I'm done really recapping everything in a detailed fashion.  Here's Sunday's recap: went places with Jan, got Scott a gift, using that gift to get myself something, and getting an HDTV connector.  Awesomeness came after that with XBOX games in HD.  Pissed the rest of the day away playing games, trading Tiger Woods for ESPN NFL Football, had some fun.  Today, Mon, June 7: 2nd verse, same as the first.  Pretty much the same as Sunday, minus the store visits and I switched ESPN NFL for Armed and Dangerous.  No real recap for today is necessary.  And now, I introduce to you, the official Jeff Patterson Blockbuster Games Flip Card Review List©™, where I give a rough review of the games I rent from Blockbuster using my awesome Games Flip Card ($49.99 for 3 months worth of renting is an awesome deal).  Today I will review all the games I've rented thus far (based on a small amount of playtime, so this is more like a first impression review), and maybe I will update the list as I go at later dates.  I reserve the right to change the rating system on the fly, whether it be a Grade (like an A, B, C, etc.) or a rating scale out of 10.  Full Spectrum Warrior - D;  I have an idea, let's give gamers a graphicalicious game where there's lots of intense shooting, but not let the player actually do the shooting.  They'll just order around 2 teams of soldiers and TELL them when to shoot rather than shoot themselves and blow shit up as they see fit.  I'm sorry, but if I want to order around troops strategically, I'll play Advance Wars for the GBA.  Project Gotham Racing 2 - A; Awesome game, awesome graphics, awesome cars, awesome multiplayer (even just in split screen, seeing as how XBOX Live isn't working right now for Jeff).  This is the game I played for about 4 straight hours Friday night until 1:30.  Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 - B-; I've heard everyone who plays this loves it, but I don't see how great it is.  I can see how it'd get addictive, but it just took too long for me to play a round of golf.  I could play a full 18 in Links in about 20 minutes, and the analog swing control is done better with that.  I also don't like how you can modify your shot in Tiger Woods in mid-air.  Why can I put spin on the ball in mid-air?  Shouldn't I be putting spin on the thing during my swing?  Putting also sucks, as a caddy just tells you where to put it in relation to the cup (in terms of feet and inches), but you have to guestimate these lengths.  I want all golf games to just have a putting grid like in Hot Shots Golf 3.  It doesn't spoon feed you a 40 ft. putt.  It doesn't tell you where to put a putting cursor.  It takes skill, unlike the luck needed in Tiger Woods (which is what is required to do that guestimating).  ESPN NFL Football - B+; It took me a little while to warm up to the game, but I realized I was just really attached to the Madden/NCAA control scheme.  The running game really is better in this game, as the running back will oftentimes "get skinny" as it's referred to in football as, when running through a tight hole in the line.  A few problems remain that I remember from NFL2k1, including but not limited to: all runningbacks can break at least one tackle each play it seems (I remember breaking 9 tackles in one play back in NFL2k1), a pass magically falling out of a receiver's hands when he should've caught it (although this problem has been fixed for the most part, it still pops up a couple times a game), and I also found a case of early 3D football games as cornerbacks ran away from the ball or let easy INT's drop out of their hands.  This all may sound like griping, but I still enjoyed the game quite a bit.  The Crib is actually quite cool, as it allows Sega nuts like me to put Panzer Dragoon posters up on the walls in the Crib.  (Note: I haven't played the First Person Football thing so far.  I played it for two seconds on the PS2 version a while back and hated it, so I'm staying far away from it).  I'll hold back on Armed and Dangerous because I want to play more than an hour and a half of it before I give it a grade.  This is Jeff, and I had a whole lot on my mind.  http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=jeffispiked  jeffisclassic.blogspot.com    (Jeff's other blog)  creativeblog.blogspot.com (Derek's blog, although I screw with it every now and then)

      So, I haven't played ea sports' NCAA Football 2004 in probably 2 or more months and it's primarily now because I can't wait for NCAA 2005 to come out. This game is going to be the greatest game NCAA has ever had.  There are going to be a few new things that are going to make this game even better than the 2004 version like the controller shaking uncontrollably on fg's and on any game action in tough games on the road apparently. By the way, Notre Dame Stadium is the 2nd toughest stadium to play in according to the people at EA. I've been critical of NCAA for a few things, like ohio state's lack of buckeye stickers and the lack of crowd noise just before kickoff like you always hear in the actual games but this game may overcome that by just being so awesome it will make me forget about those relatively unimportant nuances. I can't wait to start a dynasty with the Irish and win a lot of national titles, a lot more than I did on NCAA 2004, I somehow managed to lose games every year the first 3 years of my dynasty and only won 3 national championships to this point. It's going to be a game that's going to be hard to stop playing for the first few weeks, but if it's as good as last year's game, I will still be playing it after the season is over! I just can't wait, it's going to be so much fun! Jeff and I going to some random place and getting the game the DAY BEFORE it is supposed to come out! I'm going to have to start an official countdown soon!

      My Personal List of top 10 games Game             Year          Score    1. ND-Navy       1946          0-0 Tie 2. ND-Mich. St.  1966          10-10 Tie 3. ND-Miami      1988          31-30 ND 4. ND-Fla. St.   1993          31-24 ND 5. ND-Houston    1979          35-34 ND in Cotton Bowl 6. ND-Alabama    1973          24-23 ND in Sugar Bowl 7. ND-Penn St.   1992          17-16 ND  8. ND-Texas      1971          24-11 ND in Cotton Bowl 9. ND-USC        1964          20-17 USC 10. ND-BC        1993          41-39 BC  There's the top 10 games in fighthing irish football history. I could go on and on about all of them but i'm just going to pick out a couple on this list. The 1966 game at Michigan State is a classic game that is actually shown on espn classic sometimes. Irish coach Ara Parseghian was berated for running out the clock and preserving the tie instead of going for the win, for you dummies out there, no overtime existed stupidly until the 1996 season. The 1988 game vs. Miami was the great "catholics vs. convicts" game and it was that game that brought Notre Dame back to the scene after being out of the sun for 7 years or so. Of course controversy ensued as it always seems too. Miami fullback Cleveland Gary appeared to score the tying touchdown midway through the 4th quarter but the official ruled that Gary fumbled the football and Michael Stonebreaker recovered for the Irish and then Pat Terrell batted down a 2-point conversion pass to save the victory and eventually a national championship, whew! The last game worth mention is the '93 game vs. Florida State who was supposedly unbeatable and came in ranked #1 having won 16 straight. Notre Dame manhandled the smallish seminoles all over the field and proved they were the best team and won 31-24, yes again controversy, a Florida State receiver was wide open in the end zone on the game's final play but 'noles Qb and 1993 Heisman Boy Charlie Ward didn't see him as he blended in with the fans standing on the field in the back of the endzone and instead threw to a triple-covered receiver and the ball was batted down by Shawn Wooden. In other news, the ND football poster that says "onward to victory" and shows the players walking down the great tunnel touching the "play like a champion today" sign came in the mail today and so did the jersey. All in all, a good day, other than the damn cicadas, they are buzzing relentlessly without stopping.

      I'm going to try this thing and see if it helps me from bugging other people with my worthless sports stories and such. I consider myself to be the Fighting Irish's biggest fan because I think about the team all day long, yes I'm fanatical, I even dream about Notre Dame and I wake up thinking about them. Nothing stands out about today other than the ride to school on the big thing we like to call the "cheese wagon." I began to think about how the, pardon my language, sorry idiots from the AP and the other polls screwed the Irish out of the 1993 national championship because they liked Bobby Bowden better than Lou Holtz. I was thinking that if they had awarded the Irish with the mnc that year they would never have gone downhill into the poor, pitiful mess they were last year and have been for the last 10 seasons. The national championship would've eased Holtz's depression after the Boston College loss one week after beating the best team "supposedly" and eventual national champion Florida State, he still hasn't recovered from that loss and it effectively helped push him out the door at Notre Dame. Thanks a lot stupid pollsters with your political views taking something special away from a deserving team. Other than that, nothing happened today.

      These Espn lists are horribly put together and the rankings are way off. Last night was the "Best Sports Movies" of the last 25 years. They had "Rudy" ranked 24th out of 25, need I say more, when you put a movie such as that at 24, the rest of the show is not worth watching. I don't have a problem with them ranking "Hoosiers" at #1 because it is a good movie but to put "Rudy" at 24 was a slap in the face. I have to quite honestly admit that I don't know much about movies but I do know that there haven't been 23 better sports movies than "Rudy" in the last 25 years. Even people that despise ND love the movie, it's the kid that was always put down and said he couldn't do something, and he worked his ass off and he did what everyone said he could never do, it's an inspiration to all of those kids that have a dream that everyone says is unattainable. Plus that, it's just a good movie with lots of symbolism. I know why Espn did this, because they are political and those "experts" that voted for this list doesn't like ND so they put it at 24. This isn't the only list that's been a joke, their "best teams list" was also junk. The "worst teams list" was so stupid, who cares who the worst teams are of the last 25 years, nobody likes losers. Why Espn does these lists is beyond me if they can't do it in a professional manner and let the fans make the decisions as to the best and worst of stuff for the last 25 years. Hell, they have a poll every week on espn.com asking people to rank this stuff, why do they bother if they aren't going to use it for the show. They came up with the phrase "The season of the fan," if they are going to come up with that, don't you think they should follow the slogan and let the fans be heard? I don't like the way the shows are set up with these people holding up signs that say the team or the movie or whatever on them and they have this guy that laughs and lends nothing to the show. It's totally unprofessional and garbage as far as I'm concerned. You know people, I don't even think they had the 1972 Miami Dolphins on that list of greatest teams! I've never thought they were the best pro football team of all-time but they went UNDEFEATED, shouldn't that count for something. I usually enjoy lists like these but some of them are so stupid, this week it's going to be "worst sports blunders" another stupid list. I usually like to debate them but these are so off base that they can't be debated because everyone is in agreement that they are horrible.

      I got kinda ticked off with that stupid DVD of mine with that old ND game on it again today. I refrained from snapping it over my leg and breaking it into a bunch of itsy bitsy pieces because I figured it could still somehow be fixed. It's still freezing early in the second quarter, I don't know what's up with the thing, maybe it's scratched or is just a crappy DVD. All I know is that I don't have the patience to deal with this troublesome piece of shit, I want things to be perfect and when something such as this happens it ticks me off so much that I want to trash the thing. I have one question for the people I bought this from, why the hell do you put the first half on one DVD and the second half on another DVD? It doesn't make any sense, why not put the entire game on one DVD instead of wasting two for one 3 hour game when you could easily fit both halves on one DVD. This wouldn't upset me so much if my enjoyment over the summer didn't come almost exclusively from watching these old games, but it does. I'm excited about going to the Reds-Pirates game this Saturday, we're going to be sitting down the right field line about 10 rows up from the field, easily the best seats I will have ever sat in at any major sporting event I have attended. My countdown to NCAA Football 2005 coming out is down to 22 days, whoo! I can barely wait and since you can make your own signs for fans to display this year I can bad mouth any team I play and that especially Michigan. I told Jeff some lame joke earlier that really sucked after I read it myself, it seemed clever at first but I'll come up with something much better by the time I play my first game against Michigan with the Fighting Irish on this years version. This game is going to be completely different from past versions of NCAA since you're now going to have to make sure all of your players go to classes and get good grades, I can't have any Maurice Clarett's on my team. And you have to make sure they are happy with their role on the team and also make sure that if they getting the ball to their liking if they are a "skill position" player or they might transfer to your rival, in which case, I'll make damn sure I decapitate them when I play them. There is also this new "match-up stick" thing that shows you how composed your players are and how well your receiver matches up with the defender guarding him to see where you can get the mismatch, should be cool. The "home field advantage" will be cool because it's going to psych out guys when they play your team when you are the home team if you play at a big time stadium. The controller is going to shake and probably piss us off and cause us to screw up if we try to call an audible and the receiver can't hear the QB because it's so loud, that might help me out against Jeff. I've tried a lot of stuff to beat Jeff but he is so good that he still beats me. The last time I played him, he beat me 31-24, damn so close, I was up late in the game and he came back, that was about as well as I can play too. They're also going to have a few new defensive sets on this year's version like the 3-3-5, 3-3 stack and 4-2-5 alignments. I'll check out all of those and try to come up with a plan to beat him. I've never seen anyone stop his offense that he calls the "highly effecient offense of doom" which is exactly what it is. The main thing when playing against him is he makes so many clever moves that you can't get a hand on him to tackle him, he laughs at us when we try to play him but it's okay because he can, he's better than us. On the other hand, DJ says brags about how great he is but he doesn't have the game to back it up, he talks a big talk but can't back it up. I'm no great NCAA player, I just love the game but I still beat him like 24-0 the first time I played him, and I beat him a second time in a closer game but a win is a win, what a phony. We're going to have to talk Jeff into letting his friends play him on the PS2 and Xbox equally, so that we have a fair shot to beat him, at least me, I'm not sure if the others have an Xbox or not but I don't and that's all I care about. I'm sure he'll let me play him on PS2 to be fair, because he's a fair guy and he'll still probably kick my ass. I've rambled enough here for one day.

      Got my senior pictures done today, it was fine basically except for the fact that they were at 9am! Great time to have your pictures taken, especially since you aren't used to waking up until at least 11:30am for the last few weeks. I think I put more hair spray in my hair in one time than I ever have in my life combined. I showed up a tad late but it apparently didn't matter much because no one else was there, shows you how popular it is to have your pictures taken on Saturday. I went a few weeks ago to have the "friends" picture with Jeff, Terrell, Drew, and Nate and we had this really weird guy taking the pictures and he took most if not all of Jeff's pix. I went in figuring I'd either have that guy or that other weird guy that was also there the day Jeff got his taken but I was in for a surpise. I got this really hot girl to take my pictures instead of the weird old man or the really weird young guy. I hate getting my pictures taken but it was ok after my mother complained about possibly having to have retakes if these didn't come out as she wanted, of course she had to say something like that, she can't stop herself. The rest of the day was uneventful, I went to Meijer's to look for a college football preview magazine, which they didn't have. Came home, waited to see if Jeff would get online in Michigan, which he did but I guess he was on while I was asleep and I didn't respond, ah well, guess he will enjoy that van that he went there to get. What's wrong with Tiger Woods, this guy was the greatest player on the face of the earth, now he's nothing more than an average player that can't consistently hit the ball straight off the tee. I doubt he will win this major which will make it 8 straight majors without a win, a slump for him. As long as "lefty" doesn't win I'm fine with it, it would be nice to see Tiger have a nice day and get to even par which would mean he'd have to shoot a 65 tomorrow, very difficult but I don't think impossible for him.

      So, I go to watch this old ND football game that I have on DVD, it froze on me a couple times the first time I watched when I first got the DVD. But this time it was going smoothly through the first quarter for the most part. Then I'm sitting there watching it and it freezes, I'm thinking, "ah well, it'll be fine" then I try to fast forward through this part like I did the last time, but it won't fast forward. I take the DVD out and look at it, looks fine, put it back it fast foward to where I was before and it fucks up again and freezes. If you could help me out with this thing or whatever, I would appreciate it. It could just be a fucked up DVD and I'll have to buy the dvd from someone else and throw away some more money. Now I'm left hangin here with nothin to do since it's a quarter to 5 and no one's around to talk to or nothin. Could watch another game but my mom will bitch about not wanting to watch sports so I'll just wait 'till later tonight or tomorrow to watch games. What a boring day this is, I need to do something worth doing, my life goes a little something like this. Wake up at noon, go out and watch tv for a bit then eat lunch, if there's anything to eat. Then I sign on and talk to people most of the rest of the day while also reading an ND football message board and then about 7pm I'll go watch Tv Land for the Andy Griffith show, everyone says that have too much time on your hands if you watch that show but it's been a personal favorite of mine since I grew up watching it when I was little. Then at 8 I might read or watch some more TV and maybe get back online and talk to people until I go to bed, usually eating dinner late around 8 or 9 at the earliest. That's my life right now, yeah, pretty damn fun if you ask me.

      This list composed by ESPN was very average as far as I'm concerned. How can you rank the 1992 US Olympic Dream Team the 21st best team since 1979?, are you kidding me? That right there shows how good of a list this was. They ranked the '98 Yankees as the best team of the last 25 years, which I can handle but how can that olympic team not be in the top 5. The team I thought that was the best football team ever, the '85 Bears were rated the 5th best team on the list, not bad but I think they should maybe have been ranked a slot or two higher. The greatest NBA team of all-time, the 1995-96 Bulls were 2nd on the list, pretty accurate. The 49ers were on the list 3 times, the '94 team was ranked 13th, the '84 team, which I consider the best of all the 49er teams was ranked 11th and the '89 team was ranked 9th, I guess they ranked the '89 team ahead of the '84 team because the '89 niners beat 3 playoff opponents by a combined score of 126-26 and the '84 team only beat the 3 playoff opponents by a combined score of 82-26. No Notre Dame teams on the list, I knew there wouldn't be, the only college football team on the list was the '95 Nebraska Cornhuskers which ranked 10th best on the list. The '81-82 North Carolina basketball team was ranked 11th best probably because they had MJ and James Worthy. That's it for that list.   Comments from Jeff:  How can you complain about the Dream Team getting a sucky ranking?  It's obvious they don't deserve such great honor.  They were not a team, they were a group of superstars in the NBA.  It reminds me of 1980 Olympic Hockey.  As the USA prepared for the games, a team of NHL All-Stars played the Russian team (a collection of non-NHL stars) and got absolutely stomped.  This led the USA coach to want to assemble a team of players who could play as a team, rather than a bunch of stars who would only be out to make themselves look good.  In that case, was the 1980 USA Olympic team on there.  Do you believe in miracles?, because I sure do.

      I've picked my favorite sports teams over the years mostly because of the players that played on those teams that I had heard about or that I thought we great players. No, I didn't just pick the hometown teams because they were the ones close to home, I can't be blamed for my parents living in Ohio and not another state that is better. I do have to admit though that Ohio is one of the most sports crazed states in the U.S., but the problem is, most of the teams suck ass horribly. The bengals haven't had a good team in 15 years, although they are getting better. The Cleveland Cavs suck and have done so for a decade now, yes, they have Lebron James but one player doesn't make a great team. The Blue Jackets are one of the worst teams in all of hockey, and the Browns suck worse than the bengals starting last season. The only decent college teams are the Cincinnati Bearcats in basketball, they suck in football and the Ohio State Buckeyes, they suck in basketball. The teams I chose to follow when I was 8 or 9 years old aren't all that great but as anyone knows me knows that I like tradition and all of my teams have a good tradition, consequently a lot of people hate the teams I like. I did stay with one ohio team, the Reds because they have a great tradition of winning. I can't help the fact that kids my age don't appreciate the tradition of excellence of teams but it's normal and I'm abnormal when it comes to sports. I picked my favorite college teams because of great players that played on those teams, Joe Montana, ND Football and Michael Jordan, North Carolina basketball. I never thought it a big deal that I liked two different college teams since I didn't attend either college so I don't have any ties to either one. I would have no trouble giving up North Carolina basketball if I could go to Notre Dame because I think it's such a cool place and everyone that has gone there has talked about how special it was to them to go there, but I don't think I'm going to Notre Dame, but I'll still follow the team forever because I've become a crazed ND football fan in the last year or so with the more I've learned about the team's history and the university's history. Take it for what it is to you, because I'm not trying to make everyone love the teams I like, that this is even an issue that pops up from time to time is rediculous to me because I've explained it over and over again.

      He first breaks in and takes it all not that I care one bit and he actually does me a favor by putting the interlocking "ND" logo for my picture. I think I ticked Jeff off a little bit today because I was taping a 1990 World Series game because the Reds are my favorite baseball team and he didn't think I should care about it but hey, I'm just that way. I just love to watch old games and learn about historic teams because I think it's cool, I know, I know, I'm different but hell my dream job is to work in the sports information department and the University of Notre Dame someday. Sorry to Jeff if I pissed him off with my sports watching, I'll try not to do that anymore as I know he'd rather me play "Espn NFL Football." Eh, that's about all for today, I could mention some stuff I learned about the 1988 and 1993 Irish teams but I won't.
