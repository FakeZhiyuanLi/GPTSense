      oh i almost forgot... mini-crisis  of the week (i say mini because i have more important things to worry about yet i find myself thinking about this) --    writers club  + last meeting = bring your favorite thing that you've written to  share   ACK!   i could just NOT go...but i dont really want to just  cop out ...i feel bad but still - public speaking, ESPECIALLY sharing something personal...doesnt really sound like  my cup of tea .

      today was a semi-lovely day. school wasnt particularly exceptional, and i think i may have to drop out and boycott college :-(... boo for princeton review college match tests. and of course nico got every school i wanted on HIS.  sigh .  today i also realized that im gonna miss mrs. j a lot next year, english was awesome. double  sigh .   aside from that though, the rest of the day was fine. writers club afterschool, which is more like Sophie's group therapy sessions (see  Read  in the side bar)that a fun club for me...meh. im doing it to get over my mental paralysis when it comes to public speaking and sharing what i write so i guess in a way i have that in common with Sophie - its going to take some time.   the dance @ 5, listened to a cd of  Mraz   LIVE   in nici's car on the way...all i can say is ohmygodjasonmrazisfuckingawesome. He is sooo much more amazing live than recorded. it was orgasmic.   i want to marry him and have his babies. sigh.   not too much can be said about dance except that im not really looking forward to our annual recital since i keep messing up on  singing in the rain . blah. after we listened to some more mraz on the way home (

      dance yesterday was crappy. i chalked it up to a long, stressful week, but to be honest usually that makes me dance better..my heart (and mind) just wasnt in it i guess. i got singled out like 20 times :-P. meh. it was soooo freaking hot though, i wish we had air conditioning...or a fan.   chilled after w/ the one and only k-lizzle to the izzle...man, it was off the  hizzle . started out @ her house, then hoyers then my house where some questionable pictures were taken...then deleted. ::evil laugh:: the world will never know...  ah well. i also decided two things today. the first one is im sick of myself, and im also sick of complaining about it. its time to do something. i seem to attribute alot of the reasons im frustrated with my life to the fact that im fat. so its time to stop talking about and do something.  i am going to lose weight . Second, i also decided that i would like another pet. another rabbit i mean. since a dog is out of the question with college in two years. maybe for my 17 birthday that will be my present to myself. hm. i think i will name my rabbit martin, after martin on without a trace.

      today was an unusually good day...i suppose i should enjoy it while it lasts. school was  nothing extraordinary , had two math tests, which was no fun and im positive i failed both. why the  cheery  disposition then, you ask? i dont particularly care for some reason...perhaps its because i can retake them? meh. oh well.  had two lessons today... fun fun  :) plus it was mr. powers  birthday . well the first one wasnt an actual lesson, since it was really tara and liz's lesson, but mr. leung just assumed it was my lesson as well...and i didnt bother to correct him. ah well. not like i missed much.  watched  school of rock  in eng. today which, well, rocked. mrs. johnsmeyer likes that movie, heh.  my  mom doesnt think its funny...j-meyer is definetely  one cool lady .  drama meeting  after school, went well, and i have found that so far i dont particularly care too much who wins secretary. i guess thats becuase i know that i can still make myself  heard  whether im an officer or not. besides nicole amanda and i practically did their jobs for them this year, just with out the benefits. oh yeah, and  irony of all ironys ... danielle  nominated  joe  for president.  life is funny  sometimes. said my little spiel about summer fundraising without getting all  tongue-tied / flustered  from "public" speaking...go me! no really. im proud of myself.  after the meeting i had a  lovely  chat with  lee  and mr. roth about a myriad (*SAT word alert*)of shows including   Wicked   (:-D),  Sweeney Todd ,  Assassins ,  Sly Fox , and of course  Les Mis . then i played a  random game  with MR, which i will call the square root game. sounds math geeky but it was  just silly .  i love being silly . it makes life so much more  fun . also im now curious to see if i can find a way to get the  birthdays  of every single person who goes to  No Rock  to see which is the most/least common birthday, since apparently  july  birthdays are uncommon. which is  odd , to me at least, since i know liz, who shares my  exact  birthday, and a lot of people in my fam have july bdays. hm. anyway. tutored, came home, and felt loved cause  steph  had called while i was out to see if i wanted to go out to dinner :) i was mad i wasnt home to go but now im getting ready to go see her voice recital @  RCC  so yay! i love being  b-u-s-y.

      hey there all you faithful nonexistant readers, and jacqui. shout out to  spark , woo! dont you feel special?   yeahhhh ok anyway. holy CRAP this blog is  addicting . i cant stop writing in it. i guess thats a  good  thing...  so  j-meyer's  class was cool.  nicole  and i were comparing how similiar it was in fact to our high school class. i was  excited  because i knew a lot of the stuff they were talking about, i was like im only a junior in high school, what what! nicole, i fear, was not as  entertained  as i was...ah well. words are my passion, what can i say, as music is hers. i decided that i really do love words. a lot. is that sick or what? meh.ive never been a normal child. i especially liked the  urlLink Get up and Bar the Door  poem...it was so amusing - see? throughout history women always  win  in the battle of the sexes eventually. There probably are 10 other things that i could, wait no,  SHOULD  be doing right now, but lately ive taken to shunning all responsibilities in favor of becoming a fat useless  blob . i went to an english class at RCC for  kicks and giggles  last night, came home, and proceeded to not do any of my  actual  homework. way to get my priorities straight. it must be the warm weather, my body thinks its summer...speaking of, i really dont  intend  to become fat (well fatter than i already am anyway) and/or useless this summer...i really must get one of those, what are they called again? oh yeah...one of those  job  things...too bad im prematurely fat and useless. i really should have applied for  camp  by now. i guess i was holding out for something better, but who am i kidding...this is rockland county, and i have no  car . meh.     random thought  to leave you with: have you ever felt so... safe  with someone you just  couldnt stop  wanting to be around them because you've become  addicted  to the  feeling ?

      striking out solo...a little blog endeavor of my own. not that i dont   this weekend surprisingly i had something that somewhat resembled a  life . friday was tap tap tap, im out of shape from missing so many classes and i hate it, ive gotton so  clumsy  (well more that usual anyway) and i cant get my heels up for  wings ...grr. then it was off to babysit, where i got to eat mini slices of pizza and turn  cartwheels  outside in the lovely weather. it was nice to act like i was the one who needed babysitting for a change. theeen was joefi  surprise  party at gong's, i missed the surprise part and also mr. powers, i was disappointed but at least joe liked the  ninja turtles  i got him, yay! played a little  ping pong  with gong, michelle, and nici, sung along to  MRAZ , acted a bit crazy, tried to  juggle  and ended up grabbing my  boobs , woo! and this is me...sober. sheesh. hung out talking with mich and nici upstairs for awhile, regrettably michelle was not feeling well but she still managed to be her entertaining self. im so glad  michelle  and i have become better friends this year, she really is an awesome person, and plus she loves  wicked  too. weeee. ugh i just realized i have a tutoring session tommorrow. its nice to be making some $ and also to have the car 4 days out of the week (getting to know stony pt quite well lol) but still all this academic stimulation is wearing me out. goodnight no one, since no one is reading this.

      you know what i really hate lately? everything. no really. i hate people. maybe im expecting too much from them. maybe im just oversensitive, but sometimes it seems like im the only one of my friends who cares about, well, being a good friend. i think that there are certain unwritten rules to friendship, things like you dont steal your best friend's boyfriend or eat their mcdonalds salad while theyre in the bathroom, etc. and you would expect that you would be able to trust your friends, maybe not all of them, but at least your closest ones. stuff like that. is it too much to expect certain things out of friendship? im beginning to think so. maybe im the only person who thinks its important to be sensitive to the stuff thats going on in their lives, how theyre feeling and the things that they might need from a friend at the moment, whether its a pint of ben and jerry's or a long talk or a good smack in the face. and there should be a little give and take in the relationship...you listen to them constantly complain about their boyfriend,and in turn they listen to you whine about your failing math grade. sometimes you may get sick of hearing about loverboy, and they may get sick of hearing about the test you bombed,  but you both listen because thats what friends are for - theyre youre support group, your guidance counselors, and your advice encyclopedias.  lately i feel though that some friendships i have are rather onesided. im the shoulder-to-cry-on/gossip buddy/mall companion when its convienent. and theyre there for me too...but only sometimes. they dont always notice when things are bothering me because they can only care when they have a free moment from their own lives. im by no means saying that i dont do the same thing, because im sure that there have been many times when i was too wrapped up in whatever was going on in my own life to notice...but i do know that i make a conscious effort NOT to do that.  the truth is that i have very few friends who do the same. if i ever do that i wish that one of my friends would be like, hey, whoa, you need to stop with the Me-fest and pay attention to what im going through here. maybe thats what  i  need to do right now...i do realize that most people arent mindreaders.  i would do almost anything for someone i care about...but i just get the feeling that im everyones afterthought.  im not trying to make myself out to be a martyr. i dont think there should be rewards when ever someone does some thats "good friend"-y. there are lots of sacrifices and compromises in friendship. but i dont think that its asking too much to expect people to pull their weight in a relationship. any relationship - boyfriend, girlfriend, sister, father, employer...and quite frankly, im tired of being someones "best buddy" when were alone, and when their are other people around its a different story. i also dont mean to give the impression that this is a rant about one person in particular, because its not...but i certainly do hope that the people in question figure out that im talking about them, because unless things change, i dont forsee these friendships lasting much longer. perhaps im at fault..maybe its something that im doing that makes them not want to reciprocate, i dont know...  i think that the main issue is that there needs to be some communication. ive been so intent on removing myself from being involved in any type of drama this year, and any kind of fights, that ive been afraid to confront things that arent just petty high school crap. or maybe they are. but its time to deal with whatever you want to call it.

      too much has happened between now and the last time i posted to bother updating on that, and plus if i do it it will just make for a long, whiny entry about my current friends marathon, my regents grade and a plethora of school-related crap SO i think ill start with the present. Presently, im sitting at my computer still im my pajamas eating ice cream cake, which i should not be eating but i am anyway because man those crunchies are GOOD. carvel ice cream cake, mmmmm. yum. ok so anyway i really  should  be getting dressed since my sister is bringing home two of her friends today but meh, whatever, i dont like the two shes bringing home anyway. nothing too exciting going on at the moment, just basically enjoying the peacefullness of having the house to my self. later though ill be embarking on a funfilled adventure to the city with my nicole and her dad for her birthday. yay! im like a peeinginyourpants kind of excited, we might go see  avenue Q  (yay!) and if not something else like  beauty and the beast  which is still awesome. and it will be my first time ever going to colony, ive been DYING to go there, you have no idea. im sure ill have something much better to write about than my love affair with carvel ice cream cake a little later.  "Hee!" moment of the day: (well actually yesterday)...nici spelled writer "righter". hee! :-P

      -- asher    oh! i almost forgot- the best part of my day...  wind ensemble this morning was excellent. one of the better mornings ive had in a long time, and i have joe to thank for it. He conducted  Pilatus  today...man i love that piece. the feeling i get from playing it and being a part of the sound is right up there with the feeling i get watching wicked - like pure, unencumbered  happiness . its moments like that that i think everyone lives for. there was this electricity in the room, i think because everyone really loves this piece so they get really into it. maybe its just because im not a particularly good musician, but i dont have musical experiences like this very often. i mean, i play every morning, 5 days a week...and i enjoy it, i do..but  then there are times like these when i just LOVE it. im not just blowing air into my instrument and playing notes...something else happens, and its hard to explain, like suddenly i no longer have blood flowing through my veins...i have  music . and there was just this feeling of being completely together, connected, with everyone in the room, like being on the same page with 50 people at once.  Joe did a fantastic job conducting, as liz, tara and i were discussing in gym during the Super Bird championship (aka our last badmitton game, which i ended by hitting liz in the head with my racquet, oops.)..anyway so as we were saying, so far i think he was the best student conducter we've had, ever. really. he seemed very calm and confident (although his shaking hands gave him away, hee) up there, which i know must take a lot of guts to do...i wouldnt be able to do it for sure. he did very well, we didnt have to stop every ten meausures like usual, which was a plus, and it was fairly easy to see where the beat was,etc, as opposed to someother conductors weve had. confidence and clear beat pattern- i think those are the two things most student conductors weve had have lacked, so  kudos to you joe on a job well done. i can definetely see you as music teacher one day. and im excited - we get to play again on monday! YAY!

      ...what i wish i was doing right now. life is really kicking the shit out of me lately.   on a brighter note, tonight was fun. let me backtrack a little - quick recap: listening part of music theory final today, meh. johnsmeyers class, yay but im sad because monday is our last class. math, i need a perfect part two so i can get an 83, which is the highest i can get now since my part one sucked, double meh. work 3-6 (i failed to mention that im working at hoyers now, come visit, but dont order anything in a cone, im not so good at those yet.), and tonight went to the mall with the one and only nici pags. we spent more time apart than together in barnes and noble due to her tendency to wander and mine to get completely absorbed in reading book covers and not notice where shes wandering to. got something for mrs. j, check. nic took care of the things for powers and roth, check check. got nothing accomplished that i wanted to really, still, it was nice to go out. went to girl prop (aka the prostitute-in-training store), usually i hate going in there, but nici found this adorable teapot shaped bag (it has a teabag shaped clasp!!) that im in love with and SO jealous she bought...i may have to go back and buy myself one, and just wear it places where i wont see her or any mutual friends...not that she would care, but i do hate to be unoriginal and she saw it first...meh. I WANT IT! broke out the old school  urlLink john mayer  cd on the way home, havent listened to that in ages but it was nice.  my stupid mouth ..mmm i forgot how much i love that song.   as for the rest of this weekend, im working sat and then babysitting, sun studying for physics, so this should be a fun-filled weekend. ah well.   oops, going to have to cut this entry short, my dad is going psycho because i ate cereal in my room before and left the bowl there. my bad.

      ok so quick  urlLink Tony  recap:  defying gravity....hm, not their best performance, they had to do it faster and they cut a lot out but it was still  excellent .  yay joe mantello (he won best director of a musical for  Assassins , but he also directed  Wicked !)  blah blah blah   yay susan hilferty (best costume design - Wicked !)  blah blah blah   yay eugene lee (best scenic design - Wicked !)  blah blah blah   yay phylicia rashad (best performance by a leading actress in a play - Raisin in the Sun)   yay audra macdonald (best actress in a play - raisin)   and....of course....   Best Performance By a Leading Actress in a Musical   -    YAY IDINA!!!!     urlLink Wicked  didnt win Best Musical, which it definetely deserved, but at least it was  Avenue Q )

      urgh havent blogged in awhile. its just that getting on to any website from internet explorer or aol on my comp is such a project lately. no wonder i havent checked my mail in like a year. ah well. SAT's down, finals to go...im so petrified of physics...i better start working on my guessing skills. its so weird to think that its the end of the year already. i mean, everything in the beginning of the year feels like it was two years ago (PSAT class, design for murder, etc seems so long ago),but still its hard to believe that in a few short days we'll be beginning the last whole summer of our lives.   slept over at jens last night, i think sparky was a little disturbed by my spooning comment but all in all it was a good night. oh yeah saw HARRY POTTER (!!!!!) yesterdsay! ot was definetely the best out of the three movies, but i was severely disappointed in the lack of attention paid to the marauders map and the whole moony, padfoot, wormtail, and prongs relationship, it definetely felt like it was just assumed that you had read the book and understood but it took away from the movie that way. through the whole think i was waiting for them to explain it. ah well. the prisoner of azkaban is one of my 2 favorite HPs, so im glad to say i wasnt terrible diappointed in the movie or anything, i didnt think it was bad but it was lacking some.

      on a lighter note from the previous entry, i finally finished  the joy luck club , which i absolutely love love love loved! i really did, i think everyone should read it. yay for amy tan! summer reading is so much more fun when you dont have to take notes. (we  dont  have to take notes, right? lol) and mr. schneider told me that if i liked it, i should read&nbsp; falling leaves &nbsp;by Adeleine Yen-Meh, so i think im going to try that next. im still working on  sophies world , which is not as good as joy luck, but oh well. im going to finish it by the end of the month, thats my goal anyway, so that i have&nbsp;the rest of august to read  genesis  and my other book which i havent decided on reading yet. ive already read  the hours , but i didnt like it so id rather not have to write an essay on it later.  &nbsp;  so far i also love love love working at the summer music program. the kids are cute and i get to sit in on things like drama class :-) and rhythm class and watch teachers who i wish i had when i was in elementary and &nbsp;middle school! theyre all awesome, they almost make me want to become a music teacher too. oh yeah, and last week i got to give a flute lesson to a beginner, that was lots of fun...it was weird going backwards and doing stuff like learning notes and scales, but i secretly loved it because of course i can do all that and the girl thought i was so good, lol...which i am not, but it made me feel good.  &nbsp;  oh yeah and  my birthday  is in four days, weeee! i can't wait, we're going to stir crazy :)! ("we" being jen, jacq, kris, katie, nici pags, liz -who's birthday it will also be on weds., yay for july babies!).anyone else who wants to come is invited, see me&nbsp;for&nbsp;details.&nbsp;im so excited, i have a car now...my mom got her new one, and my dad is taking my moms old one, so i get his. yay for honda accords everywhere!   oh another good thing that happened recently is that my nana gave me her old record player so now i can finally listen to the LPs i bought last summer, plus all of my uncle dans albums that he left at our house (which include ones such as bob dylan  self portrait ,&nbsp;joni mitchell  the hissing of summer lawns ,&nbsp;jesus christ superstar, andy williams and company, and liberace)&nbsp;and the beatles one i bought at colony...im in heaven.   >> today is a sad day for ozians   everywhere...its kristen chenoweth's last show!

      hey all. im finally returning from a rather long hiatus, and what do i have to tell you? its almost three in the afternoon, and so far ive spent the entire day sitting around in my pajamas and self-medicating with mint chocolate chip, all because of my stupid&nbsp;four on the ap test.&nbsp;i think there's something wrong with me. i really do. i mean,&nbsp;four isnt a bad score. so why am i depressed over this? its stupid. bleh.  &nbsp;  as for the rest of everything, these past couple of days have been a complete&nbsp;blur. last tuesday (was it tuesday?) my mom's brother, my&nbsp;uncle, had a heart attack. apparently he was working out at the gym, on the stair master thing, and he just collapsed. luckily there was a doctor there, and they started cpr until the ambulance came. my mom keeps&nbsp;telling everyone&nbsp;how his heart completely  stopped , and he was technically dead for five minutes. i hate when she says that...it freaks me out. so anyway...they took him to the hospital, and he was unconscious for a really long time...i think like 26 hours or something close to that. i know it was more than 24. it was really nerve-racking...ive never known anyone who was unconscious for that long before. my moms other brother also had a heart attack two years ago, but it was much more minor. he was fine, he never lost consciousness or anything, and we didnt even know about it until two days after the fact. so now we think theres some kind of heart problem that runs on my moms side of the family. which is fantastic, since we already knew about the one on my dads side, and i was born with a heart defect. so anyway, back to my uncle....everyone was obviously immensely relieved that he regained consciousness. but now the problem is, he can't remember anything for a week, and he can't retain anything&nbsp;in his short term memory.&nbsp;according to his doctors,&nbsp;this is because of the lack of oxygen&nbsp;going to his brain during the time&nbsp;he collapsed before the cpr was started.&nbsp;for example, over the&nbsp;july fourth weekend, he, my aunt, and my cousins&nbsp;had gone&nbsp;up to this lake upstate called tupper lake. and so for&nbsp;awhile after my uncle woke up, he thought that they were still there, and he had absolutely no idea that he had had a heart attack. my mom went to visit him, and she said every time my aunt would tell him he would start to&nbsp;cry. he also didnt remember the next day that my mom and nana had been to visit him, or that his daughter had been there. my other uncle flew in from seattle to visit him, hes leaving today though. so anyway, to wrap this up, my uncle was transferred to a hospital in the city. his short term memory should come back, although it could take months, and he may never fully regain it. but already hes starting to make progress...he understands now that he had a heart attack (he doesnt really remember, but since everyone keeps telling him he remembers that), and he remembered his brother coming to visit him, etc. little things like that. which is good. theyre also going to plant a defibillator thing on his heart, like a pacemaker i think but not exactly, because they discovered that he has an irregular heart&nbsp;beat.&nbsp;so i guess hes on his way to recovering now, it was a pretty scary couple of days though. he has a really high stress job, and hes always all over the place, he likes to be busy i guess, but i think hes going to have to make some major lifestyle changes. we'll see what happens.

      i cant think of any good way to begin this entry so i guess ill just dive right in. thursday night (at least im pretty sure it was thursday) nici and michelle called me to hang out, which i was happy about since michelle has been in colorado and i missed her. i was late as usual, since my uncle was leaving the next day to fly home and i wouldnt see him again, and i was torn between visiting with him and michelle, so i tried to divide my time. when i got there i was pleasantly surprised to see joefi, who i had also not seen in quite some time. we roasted some  marshmallows  on the  grill  and made some s'mores :). as nici said, it was nice to have the condom debaters back together again.  now, as im sure you are sitting on the edge of your seat in anticipation, here is an update on my week thus far-->   monday:  an insignificant day of the week, and therefore not worth my time.     tuesday:  went to the mall with my favorite shopping homie nici pags. bought a pair of jeans, and a mini finding nemo fish tank that lights up and has bubbles and the fish swim around. its so gangsta lol. nici bought one too! we had japanese for  lunch , yum, i love  yakisoba ! came home, and unfortunately had to babysit, but luckily nici stayed to keep me company. yay for nici! im sure she was bored lol, so i really appreciated it. after nici went home,  wing night *   with the penny's ensued as usual, topped off with a  mocha MOOlatte  from DQ,  yum  again.     wednesday:  went to the mall for the second time in two days, this time accompanied by the lovely stephanie genovese. i was off from babysitting, so i didnt have to go home early like yesterday, yay! bought sandals in american eagle for half off, i love shoes on sale! i also bought a watch, in an attempt to teach myself to read time. furthering my fat kid ambitions, we dined at dunkin  donuts /baskin robbins/subway where i had a long overdue  strawberry frosted donut  (ive been craving one ever since old timer's day at yankee stadium, dont ask.) and a  mocha blast  (which is basically a  moolatte , but from baskin robbins, and it was better than  Dairy  Queen's). then we journeyed back to mi casa where steph serenaded me, checked out the  wicked  piano/vocal book that nic (sabino) had given me for my birthday, and taught me how to play a G chord on the guitar that i borrowed from school so that joe can teach me! yay!   today:  (that would be thursday, for those of you keeping track) woke at 1:00, discovered my mom had gone to the  deli , so i made a  cajun turkey  on  sesame bagel   sandwich , yum. babysat at 3:00, came home, and thats about it.  see, now wasnt that exciting? i bet you can't wait for my next post.       * speaking of wing night, check out the links section for joefi and matty k's fresh attempt at a blog after the disitigration of the ask madden empire.
