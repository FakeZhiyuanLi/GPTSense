      The new  urlLink Wilco  album rules.  It's so good that it makes my stomach hurt.  (High praise indeed!)

      At the risk of sounding like one of those jerks that used to come into the store screaming about how wonderful Daniel Pinkwater is and how they have to own 87 copies of the book he read on NPR even though they've never even seen the illustrations...  I heard a piece about the book   urlLink Transmission   on NPR.  (It is a grown-up book, so Daniel Pinkwater wasn't the guy doing reading, so it isn't the same anyway).  And I immediately wanted to read it--to the point that I requested that the library get it so that I  could  read it.  And I read it.  And it was super.  Basic premise.  Indian computer programmer gets a sketchy job in the states, gets here, finds out that, "Oh, crap, the computer job market isn't so great here", gets laid off, creates a virus so that his company will need more manpower to figure it out, assuming that they will hire him back, and it just goes from there...      Across America citizens started to look with suspicion at the computers on their desks.  These machines--which had always terrorized them in small ways, by crashing, hanging, demanding meaningless upgrades or simply scolding them in the persona of an annoying cartoon paper clip--were now revealed to harbor something more sinister, something with an agenda.  This was it, the enemy within, a technological fifth column in the homes of ordinary Americans.  By the time talk radio got hold of it, a consensus had emerged that the attack should be avenged in blood.  I want to read his other book, which is completely unrelated, but I really liked this one.  And hey, he won the Whitbread for the other one.

      So, I'd been eyeing   urlLink Ella Minnow Pea   (say the title out loud) for quite a while, because hey, let's face it--it's got a great cover.  I'd like to say right now that it was my library director that finally pushed me over the edge and got me to read the book--and regardless of what she says, she  is  a nerd--anyone who likes this book as much as she does is a  huge  nerd.  It was a lot of fun--people who love playing with language (or reading about playing with language) should give it a whirl.  The story is told in letters (epistolary), set on an island of people that revere Nevin Nollop, the man who (in the novel, beats me who really wrote it, but I refuse to believe that's a real person's name) came up with the famous sentence that includes the entire alphabet (pangram):  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog .  There's a statue of Nollop in town, and the letters of the sentence start falling--as they fall, the Town Elders start banning the usage of the letters, so the letters get more and more interesting as the town inhabitants try to continue communicating without using certain letters (lipogram)-- and those are just the first four.    Oh, right.  The first offense of using a banned letter: Verbal condemnation in front of the entire village.  Second?  Stocks for a day or a whipping.  Your choice.  Third?  Banishment or DEATH.  These people are not fooling around.  Fun.  Funny!  I might even need to own it.

      So I finally read   urlLink The Secret Life of Bees  .  And yes, everyone who told me, "Oh, Leila, you have to read this book, it's SO GOOD!"  Yes, you were right.  You win.  I loved it.  Although it made me cry on and off a lot.  But not it a bad way.  And even with everything that's been going on in the last couple of days, I loved it to the point where I HAD to finish it last night--I didn't want to wait to find out how everything worked out.  I started it at lunch yesterday, and was really honestly MAD when lunch ended, because I just wanted to keep reading.    This conversation is one that sticks:    "You know, some things don't matter that much, Lily.  Like the color of a house.  How big is that in the overall sceme of life?  But lifting a person's heart--now,  that  matters.  The whole problem with people is--"  "They don't know that matters and what doesn't," I said, filling in her sentence and feeling proud of myself for doing so.  "I was gonna say, The problem is they  know  what matters, but they don't  choose  it.  You know how hard that is, Lily?  I love May, but it was still so hard to choose Caribbean Pink.  The hardest thing on earth is choosing what matters."   Also, I loved the way that Lily uses the word "shitbucket".  I've tried it out a few times, and it's really satisfying.  I have a feeling that it might end up in my regular vocabulary.  I think I'll probably eventually work it into my high school reading group.  But I'll have to pick others to go with it.  Hmmm.  Southern theme?  Honey/Bees theme?  Religion theme?  Sixties theme?  There are a lot of possibilities.

      Jane got hit by a car yesterday.  Again.  She's okay, she had to stay overnight at the vet's because they had to put her under to stitch her up, but she'll be okay.  She's pretty pissed off about having to wear one of those collars, though.  She didn't break any bones or tear any muscle.  She has third degree burns over her belly and a big gash down her back leg.  Josh had some pretty hefty bites, because she (understandably) went bonkers.    I guess that she saw a dog across the street and booked out after it--a couple of teenage girls hit her, and would continued running over her if the lady with the dog Jane was after in the first place hadn't yelled at them to stop.  (They didn't know she was under the car).    I haven't even seen her yet.

      So I was just at Garden Street Market, minding my own business (staring at the Entenmann's, willing one of the chocolate-frosted chocolate cakes to morph into a marshmallow-frosted chocolate cake), when I heard a familiar giggle.  Weirdly enough, I knew exactly who it was without even looking, even though I hadn't heard that laugh since I graduated from high school.    Not counting my cousin's wedding, I haven't unexpectedly run into anyone from Maranacook in a million years (well, about nine, I guess).  It was crazy.  And so we stood in front of the Entenmann's for about a half-hour and talked about what people were up to and who we were in touch with, etc.  It was a little awkward, which is bound to happen, but not too bad.  She admitted to being one of those people that shows everyone her baby's photo, and proceeded to do so, but coming from her it was nice and funny and not annoying or lame.  It ended really well, because neither of us felt the need to say, "Oh, yeah, what's your number, yeah, we'll definitely get together blah blah blah...".  Because really, that's usually a load of crap.

      A patron just donated a box of children's books to the library--and the book contains about 40 different  urlLink Three Investigators  books--the old editions with the Hitchcock intros and the good covers.  If the Children's Director doesn't want them, I'm totally going to buy them.    My most recent book coup was the  urlLink Serendipity  books--someone donated about 27 of the hardbacks, the library didn't want 'em, and now I'm the proud owner.  I don't know why I love them so much--normally, they'd be everything that I can't stand in a book--overly moralistic, big huge weepy eyes, unicorns.  But for whatever reason, they rule.

      Other than getting paid and free laundry that is...  We're able to watch more  urlLink  Freaks and Geeks  !  Woo-hoo!  It's taking us a really long time to watch the whole series, what with the no-TV-at-home thing and all...  Josh gave me the boxed set for my birthday back in May, and we just passed the halfway mark with it last night.  It might have been the best show ever.  It kicks the crap out of stupid, tortured  My So Called Life , at any rate.  It might contain the only fictional gym teacher that you genuinely love.    And James Franco as Daniel Desario is so much more likeable than James Franco as stupid Harry Osborne.

      On my way over to the farm (we're house-sitting, which is always fun), I heard an interview with Tom Russell on NPR (regardless of what Josh says, listening to NPR DOES NOT make me a communist).  Apparently, he has a new album, which is awesome.  He is of the opinion that country music was destroyed in the mid-80's, when the industry decided to cater to a wider market, so now most of it is geared towards "middle-class white golfers".    Unfortunately, I can't seem to link to Tom Russell's website because I'm using Tony's bizarro iMac.  Rats.

      So, starting this fall, I will not only be running the High School reading group at the library, but I'll be running the Middle School group as well.  Here are the (awesome) booklists:   High School      urlLink You Don't Know Me , By David Klass  urlLink Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time , By Mark Haddon  urlLink Whale Talk , by Chris Crutcher  urlLink About a Boy , by Nick Hornby   Middle School      urlLink The Wanderer , by Sharon Creech  urlLink The Thief , by Megan Whalen Turner  urlLink A View from Saturday , by E. L. Konigsburg  urlLink Going Through the Gate , By Janet S. Anderson  As those of you from the Monkey can see, basically the lists have the same theme:  "Leila's favorite books".  (This summer I did  urlLink Last Days of Summer --they loved it, as some of them will agree--right, ladies?)

      Which is shocking, considering that it's been the rainiest summer that I can remember.  We've had maybe three sunny days.  BUT!  Today is the last day of Storytime at the Beach, and I have no desire to do the Hokey Pokey in front of all kinds of scantily-clad teenaged sun-worshippers.   Which reminds me.  A fashion don't.  (Many who know me will say that I have no room to talk, but, whatever.  Bite me).  Yesterday afternoon, we were all at the Wharf, drinking drinks.  There was a woman in her mid-30s across from us wearing Jo-Lo sunglasses, which was bad enough, but also this awful white tanktop that said, "Spoiled Rotten" across her nunga-nungas in rhinestones, with a magenta bra underneath.  The tank tap was delibarately pulled down so that the bra was sticking out.  Is this some sort of horrifyingly tacky trend that we up in Maine are unaware of?  Am I just getting old?

      Whoever is not reading Powers regularly should be. It RULES! Also, even if you don't like comic books, the personal ads at the end make it worthwhile reading for anyone. Two shining examples from the new issue:     I need a girl to prove to family and freinds that I'm not gay. Please help, I'm desperate here.  ...As long as you can reach all parts of your body, youre not too fat for me...         (Typos are theirs, not mine, thank you very much).  Also in regards to the new issue, I would just like to say to anyone who had doubts (Collomia!), "I told you so!". I knew that Bendis wouldn't have written about that little girl in the first story arc and just dropped her forever. I'm so smart that it's scary.

      This is more important than learning how to upload pictures. More important than linking to my friends. More important than bringing my paycheck over to the bank and cashing it so that I can eat breakfast. I need to spread the word.   urlLink  Shadowmancer  , by G. P. Taylor, is the WORST BOOK IN THE WORLD.   I have provided a link to it--but only so you will know what to avoid.  Do not buy it. Do not read it. Run away screaming. If someone tells you that it's the next  HP,  they obviously don't know what they're talking about and should never be trusted again. Ever.  Now that I have that out of the way, I can continue living my (very exciting) life.

      I've finally moved on from Friendster and (possibly) joined the blogger revolution.  Maybe.  Unfortunately, I'm not feeling extremely interesting at the moment.
