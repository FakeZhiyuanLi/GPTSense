      Having completely given up on the rousing round of phone tag that I seem to have with so very many of you, I have finally succumbed to "the blog." In a dying attempt to keep up with as many of you as possible, as easily (coughcoughLAZILYcoughcough)as possible, here she is. (Insert very dramatic and self-important music here...)   And on that sparkling note, would that I could christen the page with more exciting news for the week. Yet, not so much.   So, it's amazing the way leprosy dampens your social scene. Ok- so no debilitating skin disease, really, but one hell of a sunburn peeling. In fact, I am somewhat sure that my exoskeleton is still riding the Metro. (FYI: It seems that I chose to move to DC amidst the plague year. Cicadas, those gross bug(gers) that hatch every 17 years have descended, or rather, ascended upon DC in full force, flying about in kamikaze missions, running into and clinging to anything that moves, as well as leaving amber exoskeletons everywhere. See one of the nasty critters  urlLink here  ) Needless to say I'm not really presentable outside a leper colony at this point. "Hi, nice to meet you. Oops. Don't mind the skin chunk in your Chardonnay. Good for the complexion, really." And I really don't feel like doing anything other than hosing myself down with aloe and lounging about sans itchy clothing (hence the post's title).   But I've had a busy week at work and play, so I have pardoned myself for a lame Friday night at home alone. Last night a coworker and I went out for one drink at happy hour and wound up on a bar crawl with her boyfriend.Fun, but not the planned activity. The evening ended at a restaurant/bar, wherein a bartender friend of theirs started sending over free drinks, cookies (not on the menu- not sure where they came from) and even a chocolate covered strawberry, before making a production out of hugging me good night. The hitch? (Oh yes, children, we know there is always a hitch...) He's got a girlfriend. Yeah. As in, a "I'm going to NYC this weekend with my girlfriend" girlfriend.   Homey don't play that. The cookies weren't the only thing not on the menu last night.  Which brings me to a startling repeat occurrence these days. The "untouchables" sudden interest. While being hit on is a rare occurrence in itself (believe me), this little episode follows last week's married German guy getting too friendly on the dance floor. "But in my country I have done nothing wrong...!" (direct quote) Chalk it up to the perpetual strand of emotionally- and now circumstantially- unavailable suitors, and we have an episode of Oprah in the making, my friends. Sigh. Eat your heart out Dr. Phil.  Going to pop a cliche chick flick into the DVD player and call it a night.

      Dizznam. So I've been found.   Everyone else is writing about sports and politics. Might actually have to contribute non-fluff commentary into DC life.   Or not.   So it seems the men-folk have wandered into M in DC land. (Word to Marshall for the exposure. Thanks Mr. Weekly World News). The original purpose of this blog was to curb the Girl Talk rehashes that seemed to consume an inordinate amount of my Sundays.  So what now? I am lacking in Hill gossip (though I did go out with the Hill people last night- where's  urlLink Jessica Cutler  when you need some excitement), alumni news (though I do work with 2 other UM grads), and all other things southern here in DC (though I am a member of the Mississippi Society). What can I say? There are many more capable scribes than myself. This is just a forum for my daily life... not the spokesperson for MS...  Though I must admit that I am fastly falling in love with this city. Last night was spent having drinks with my girlfriends at the roof terrace of Hotel Washington. The entire city at your glass. Lovely.   Today...much less glamourous, but enjoyable just the same. Washington Post over tea, an afternoon on the porch...the week in phone calls.   Sundays.

      When the cat's away, the mice will play....  I maintain that I simply contracted cat scratch fever, and therefore cannot be held responsible for my actions.   What if you commit to being set up with a friend's friend weeks before the actual date occurs, and it inadvertently coincides with the absense of someone you may be theoretically dating?   Whoops.   To explain, the night after my first date with Military Man, I was invited to go to a cookout with a girlfriend. Once there, her good friend (and lifelong family friend), Grill Guy, had the bright idea of setting me up with his cousin, who, conveniently lives one block from me. Thinking it would at least be a diversion, if not an AMUSING diversion, I gave him my email addy.   Nothing happens.   That is, until Military Man leaves for his business trip. On the same day I get an email asking me to meet up with Neighbor Boy for drinks. ("I see dead people..." Right?) Well, I couldn't exactly cold-shoulder the guy- he's related to a good friend's family friend. So I agreed to meet him Wednesday night.   Fortunately, while I did have a fun time, there were no spark on my end.   Unfortunately, there seemed to be a spark on his end. When asked what my weekend plans were I spastically threw out a lame "Um...I'm going out with my friend Saturday night" (the same friend who is at this very second in Virginia Beach...). Don't think he bought it. I tried to soften the blow with a "but keep me in the know"!   Riiiiiiight.   And of course Military Man called last night while I was happy-houring with some new girlfriends. Didn't catch him when I called him back, so not sure what's up. Hopefully, he wants to plan something for when he gets back into the city tomorrow...

      Hmm. So shouldn't birds descend upon DC or knives go missing from the butcher block or something? Dating isn't this easy. (Insert "Twilight Zone" music and shadowy figures here.)  Military man was finally permitted entrance to my apartment yesterday. After dropping ever-so-subtle hints over course of the last week, such as: "I've never been out to Virginia before. What's it like out there? Maybe I'll go some day..."  or "Yeah, I can't really picture your apartment in my mind..." (FYI: military man moved to DC last month and lives downtown), I finally extended an invitation.   And spent the next 5 days cleaning my heart out.   Well, c'mon. You never saw Mary Tyler Moore cleaning did you? Working girls. We have.....stuff (?) to do?   And as a sidebar, I'd like to thank the gods of disposable cleaning products... I am seconds away from building an altar for the person that invented disposable Windex wipes and flushable toilet bowl brushes....  But I digress. Being out in the 'burbs, there weren't many options for entertainment, so we settled for.....talking. Like, real conversations. Like, no TV, no radio. Just talking. Like they do in the movies. Who knew people still did that?! It was actually.... refreshing? We even took a walk together. Again, who knew people still did that?!h   At this point I almost make myself gag.   And then first thing this morning I get into the office to find an email saying "It was really nice spending time with you yesterday. Thanks for everything." Oh, this guy is wracking up the brownie points.   So is it wrong that in some ways I'm glad to get a breather for the rest of the week? (He'll be out of town until the weekend) Or that I've already planned a Girls Night Out this week? Or that I went to some new friends' party Saturday and flirted until daybreak with a 6'7" blond?   Just biding my time before the draft is up, I suppose...

      Er, so 8:30 pm....where are your kids?   Sitting on their own damn couch. Alone.   Military man called Sunday to ask if he was still allowed to call (but that's another story), and also to say he wanted to see me again. And he did. Tonight. Albeit, ever EVER so briefly.   We met after work, wandered around briefly, were accosted by numerous flower vendors, and finally ducked out of the sweltering heat into a nice, air conditioned bar. More chatting, one drink, and "It was great to see you."   Now when he said he'd had a long day, and couldn't stay out late, I was cool with that. However, I didn't know that meant that after an hour and a half he'd bail.   What's up with that?   He did manage to make plans for Sunday before sprinting off into the sunset. And while that should be encouraging, I still find tonight's behavior a bit odd. "I just wanted to see you." What's that about?   And to add to the confusion, I'm now being set up with someone else's cousin. No- wait- not just a friend of a friend- actually a friend's friend's cousin. (Try and plot that one out...) All I know about the guy is that he's "a nice guy," lives near me and is tall. Still not entirely sure of how all this came to be, but have a message in my inbox giving me some guy's email address and a forward of an email from him giving the cousin the go-ahead.  Bizarre as it is- I think I might just meet this guy. Could use a distraction from military man. And so far these dating adventures have been amusing and relativey benign.   And you're only 23 once, right? I'll be old enough to know better soon enough...

      "Oops....I did it again?"   Sooooo....quite a bit confused regarding the status of things with military man. Our date last night started off with a bang- happy hour at an Irish pub near work, then a couple of rounds of pool (yeah, someone entrusted ME with a pool cue? Nice...Didn't inadvertantly bludgeon anyone, just managed to get blue chalk all over my pink sweater....Classy lady!), before we ran out of ideas. Again, we ended up at a second bar, before deciding to call it a night.   Oh yeah, and then there was the whole petty theft witness thing. Sigh. Good times.   Seriously.   We sat outside at the pub (kind of like French cafes- you are on the sidewalk), and all of a sudden, you hear "Stop him! Stop him! Stop him!" and three people go running through traffic before the bouncer at the pub reaches out and grabs this guy, who flings a purse and screams "Ok! I give! I give!" as he wiggled out of he bouncer's grip and went running down the sidewalk, with the purse owner right behind him. So like a movie.  Welcome to the City!  But I digress. Anyways, even though things went well (more of the compliments, hand holding, etc), I got "the vibe" when I left....you know, the "hmmm...something's not quite right here" vibe. So time will tell, I suppose.   And of course, so will I!  Moving on, DC has shut down for the day, and I am curled up with my laptop, lounging in my robe, "working from home." Thusfar none of my clients seem to be working, or if they are, do not seem to need any help. (Now THIS is the life! That workless workplace is finally catching on!)   Unfortunately it is a dreary day here in the Capital- both literally and figuratively. (You've all seen the news- no need to recap.) Will be glued to the TV for the remainder of the day.

      Finally. A man. And one that calls when he says he will, holds your hand, and opens all of your doors.   I give it a week.   The special treatment- not the guy. But what a great start. Especially for a blind date. So after a particularly wild Girls Night Out (good Lord, you'd have thought we were frat boys....no elaboration will be given....and woe be unto those who witnessed and have survived to tell), I drove my lifeless body home, showered and met military man (formerly, not currently) downtown for lunch. Afterwards we managed to walk every square inch of the city before hitting Union Station to watch a movie. Well, that was the plan, at least. Gee, "Harry Potter" or "Soul Plane" for a first date? We ditched that idea, and headed to his place to watch a movie. (Gutsy move, you say?)  Can I just say how refreshing it is to walk into a man's apartment and not see any of the following: pizza boxes, dirty underwear, a stack of Playboys or decaying woodland creatures.   But it gets better. When it is time for me to catch the train back to my place, he actually walks me to the Metro. And doesn't leave me there. Actually buys a ticket, walks me downstairs, and waits with me until my train comes. At which point he gives me a quick "don't take flack from anyone" pep talk/safetly lesson and asks that I call him to let him know I make it home. Cuuuuuute.   But wait! There's more....  He called the Monday to make sure I made it to work, called again today to ask me to lunch (alas, had lunch reservations with a couple of girlfriends), and has asked me to think of anything that I'd like to do later in this week.   Jackpot.   Details to come...

      Think this might possibly have been the most exhausting work week to date. And it's only Wednesday. The bad thing about being out of the office all day visiting clients is that you still have work waiting on you when you get back into the office. When, when, WHEN is someone going to catch on to this workless office place thing?! (Lead a revolution, people!) Also had a 2 hour lunch with a client....now THAT'S a lot of work. Two hours of one-on-one conversation while trying not to spill anything, choke on anything, or break anything. That's alot to ask of me, really. (Hmm...which might explain a bit of the datelessness come to think of it...)  And then one of my few girlfriends here, who is/was also a coworker, got fired at 5pm yesterday. That does a lot for office morale.   So at least on my day off - Monday- I had a fun day. And this time without baking my flesh for 8 hours and passing out on a sofa- my, but I digress... Had lunch and caught a movie (the first in seemingly forever) with a friend from Baltimore and then went to my (ex)coworker's cookout. Where, interestingly enough,the bartender's (the cookie bearing guy with the girlfriend) brother introduced me to people as his brother's fiancee. Oh, yes. Fun for one and all. I'll be SURE to post the engagement announcement here first.

        "Times, they are a changing..."     &nbsp;  Fast forward to the present: Single again.     &nbsp;  And dating.    &nbsp;  That's right. Going out Salsa dancing on a Girls Night out tomorrow night, meeting up with the cousin of my friend's friend&nbsp;(the one I was set up with&nbsp;while Military Man was out of town) at a party later, and then going to a Going Away fete on Saturday.     &nbsp;   "To every season..."     &nbsp;  And to rewind to where we last left off, children: &nbsp;Finally found the perfect gift for Military Man (a runner's guide to DC...he was looking for a good nature trail the day before his birthday), baked and decorated a cake (due to an inside joke involving Dale Earnhardt, Jr. his cake sported a nice&nbsp;model car and a Bubblehead Bubba...don't ask), and took him to dinner. He sent a great thank you email the next day, and we proceeded to see each other for lunch during the week, and planned a date for last Saturday.    &nbsp;  My, my, how things go awry:     &nbsp;  Saturday, after catcing a movie, Military Man and I went to dinner. This is where things begin falling apart. When asked for about the 4th time in 4 dates if I was seeing anyone else, I replied "no," followed by my typical "and you?" His typical answer -which in retrospect was actual weasel for: "maybe if I say no and change the subject really quickly you won't catch onto the fact that I'm lying"-of "no" this time changed to: "No. Just hanging out with people. Having fun." Red flag!&nbsp;But wanting to appear cool, calm and collected, I let it slide.   Until after dinner, when he kissed me. And then all those "Wait. Didn't he tell me he went out with his coworkers last night, and hasn't he told me three times he's not dating anyone else?" thoughts came flooding in. At which point I began asking a series of questions, all of which he began to try to elude entirely.     &nbsp;  Ladies, YOU know who he was dealing with. Unfortunately for HIM, he did not.     &nbsp;  To summarize: I left him standing in the Mall. There was a blinding moment of stupidity which followed, in which a phone call was made, and further infuriating comments were&nbsp;exchanged (including Military Man's: "We'll the way I see it we're not dating. Just hanging out or friends or whatever...it's not like you've slept with me YET!"...Try EVER jerk!), but I have not and will not speak to him again.     &nbsp;  Bastard ruined a whole military branch for me.     &nbsp;  Oh well, Marines have better uniforms.

      Exhaustion. How is that possible?   Another half day today at work. And yet I still found myself working later than everyone else. Jiggah' wha'?! I was the only fool in the office at 1 pm. So I did what any dedicated employee would do- turned my screen saver off, scattered some papers and left! (No worries...I actually cleared it with the boss first)  Needed a break from the week- my houseguest left on Monday after an action packed party girl weekend (think: reliving your college days), I went out with Military Man on Tuesday, hit a late night pub with some girlfriends Wednesday, and Thursday I cleaned until the break of dawn. So tonight I crash. And hard.  Rewinding to the Military Man mention- we need a cleanup in Aisle 5, ladies. First, second and third argument all in one evening. How's that for effiiency? Fortunately they were those silly things you fight about when you're trying to get to know someone, but really, can't we all just get along? And while I generally avoid all conflicts like a man in the tampon aisle, this has also been the first time I've had a spat with anyone I've dated. The general M.O. has just been to break-up with him. So, hopefully this is a good sign.   And agony of all shopping agonies....I have to buy Military Man a birthday gift. Ack! No, EEK in this situation. As Military Man so thoughtfully pointed out, we've been dating for a month now. So what do you give a guy when you've only dated a month? Strategic hell! Don't want to do too much and look like that sappy, needy chic, but don't want to skimp on the present and look like a thoughtless bitch.   So what to do? Friends have suggested a book (he seldom reads, and only military novels), a CD (he owns a million, and we don't have similar musical tastes) or a DVD (again, quite a collection, and so I don't even know what he has). Have pretty much decided to bake a cake and take him out for dinner. The though process being that cake=thoughful touch, and dinner=nothing too over the top or personal.   Details to follow...

      Aaaah. A lazy friday in the empty city. This is the life.   If there's one thing I love about living in a city full of politicians, it's these four day work weeks. DC will declare a holiday for just about anything. And the beauty of my job is that if clients aren't at work, I'm not at work. So this morning, I'm halfway out of the door.   Meeting Military Man for lunch before calling it a day. We both have guests coming into town for the weekend (his brother and one of my college friends), so we probably won't see each other until later next week. Must say I'm happy to report that the good behavior is holding out- he even cooked me dinner Wednesday night. (Ok, so "cook" might be a stretch, but, God love him, he tried...And it was at least edible.)  But it still looks like the proverbial other shoe could hit the ground yet. Heard about the call to duty of the  urlLink Individual Ready Reserve ? Guess who can now be given 30 days notice that he will be shipped back to Afghanistan (where he already served on two tours) or to Iraq? Yes. Military Man.   And personal ties aside, I find this whole reactivation of "retired" troops extremely scary. Essentially, the armed services are deploying nearly 10,000 men and women who have already served their countries (many have already been on deployments overseas), and are now living a "civilian" lifestyle. That means that unlike the National Guard or similar reserve troops, they haven't had a bit of training since they left the service.   Um...sound like a disaster waiting to happen to anyone else? Some of these people haven't run a block, much less a mile in four years, and I sincerely hope they haven't been doing rifle drills regularly.   Scary.
