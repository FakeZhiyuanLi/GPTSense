      It's finally confirmed. Cast in iron, set in stone. My exit date is going to be 18 July 2004.  Starting work with "The World's Local Bank" on 19 July 2004 8.45am sharp. My bosses have very generously allowed me to use my leave to offset the remaining notice period. I didnt expect them to be so generous. I am glad that i am able to leave on a positive note and that there is an open invitation to join them again in the near future.   Going forward, its back to the good ol' citi days of waking up at 6.45am, dressing sharply with well cut shirts and silk ties with french cuff links. Thanks mum for handwashing/ ironing my clothes - Love Ya !  If you observe the banker's crowd at Shenton Way, all of them have the following in common: The must have banker's accessory : Montblanc pen to ink those deals ! Oh i forgot to mention the Rolex watch as well.  Lest i am condemmed for being a hedonistic materialist, the above is actually very true of frontline bankers. A Rolex watch and that white clover leaf tip pen are the very symbols of a successful banker. As for myself, i havent got a Rolex, neither have i got a Montblanc pen. Guess I am not successful yet huh.   Oh well, i'm not hard up for such blatant symbols of wealth. I'll just wait for the bank to present it to me as a gift. I've already received a Renoma leather business card holder from my boss ! I'm glad she's not asking me to return it since i am leaving. hehehehe  Last night, i went out with colleagues for dinner and karaoke. Had a wonderful jap dinner at taka, then headed to K Box for a bleating time of canto/english/malay pop songs. It was a smashing time...a pity they didnt serve beer ! I so so need a drink. I guess its very much the company i was keeping with, rather than the actual activity that made it so enjoyable. This same gang of  colleagues are organising a kite flying exercusion cum makan session on 18 July day at Marina Bay. So Fun ! I will definitely be joining them !   CheerZ  _ _ _ _ GetZie

      Been a rather busy day for me today. Lots of phone calls in the morning from office, and other HR departments waiting for me to give them an answer. Citi HR sounded damm pissed off with me. DBS Investment Bank couldnt believe I said no to a $3.5k p.m. job. Oh well $ isnt everything. Got a counter offer from my boss as well. But i've made up my mind.   Internet connection at home was down today. Couldnt surf the net using my PC. I received a text msg from a fren telling me she had written a new blog. Well, somehow from that msg i kinda sensed that something might be amiss.   Thanks to the wonders of modern day technology, i was able to connect HP PDA to my SE mobile via bluetooth and then using the inbuilt mobile modem to surf the internet over GPRS. Cool but pretty expensive technology. A single page d/l would cost approx $1.   Ok i digress. Turns out tt she's currently having some problems. I was really sad after reading the blog as I so much wanted to help take the problem and pain away but there's really nothing i can do about it. At least not at this immediate point in time.   I feel really fortunate that I've been blessed richly by God. A warm loving family, a new job with better career prospects and friends who care and love me. I want to spread the message of love around. I wanna cheer depressed people to jump up with joy, to put a smile on the faces of the homeless. Its time for me to start voluntary work again now tt i no longer work shift and unsociable hours.    Here's a lovely poem reminding us to thank God for the many blessing both great and small he has given us.  ______________________________________  Thank God For Dirty Dishes  Thank God for dirty dishes; They have a tale to tell. While others may go hungry, We're eating very well With home, health, and happiness, I shouldn't want to fuss; By the stack of evidence, God's been very good to us.  _______________________________________  GetZie

      I love going to the beach. i love hearing the lapping of the waves. i love that funny sea smell. i love the feeling of smooth sand grains between my toes.   i miss going out to the sea.  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    At the Sea-Side  by Robert Louis Stevenson  When I was down beside the sea A wooden spade they gave to me To dig the sandy shore.  My holes were empty like a cup. In every hole the sea came up, Till it could come no more.  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    Sea of Life   Two lovers sit upon the shore, Of this vast sea of life. As they sit hand in hand and look, They contemplate their strife.  No matter if the times get hard, Their love will see them through. It bonds them close and warms their hearts, And turns their gray skies blue.  The daily trials of this life, Will try to tear their love. But it is held firm and intact, By faith in Him above.  A bond between two earthly souls, No man may tear apart. For each of them will hold a space, Within the other's heart.  The men will come and try to take, This woman from his grasp. She's flattered but before she goes, His firm hand she will clasp.  She'll feel his love all warm and soft, She'll tell the stranger, no. She'll wrap her love around her man, She'll stay and not let go.  The same will happen to her mate, When temptress comes his way. He'll shut his eyes and see the face, Of her who makes him stay.  Two lovers sit upon the shore, Of this vast sea of life. And marvel at the joy they feel, Because they're man and wife.  Then each will say a little prayer, To thank God for each other. And ask for help from Him above, For her to be a mother.  The pain and tears of giving birth, Gives way to happy joy. The child they have has lots of love, No matter, girl or boy.  As to an adult, this child grows, They'll teach it right from wrong. And every time the child is good, Their hearts will sing a song.  Until at last their child is grown, And picks a lifelong mate. And starts a family of their own, It is predestined fate.  Two lovers sit upon the shore, Two lovers, man and wife. And marvel how they made it through, This great vast sea of life.

      Best Friend Or Boyfriend?   You love hanging out with your guy friend, and the two of you ALWAYS have fun. In fact, you find yourself confiding just about everything to him and trust him completely. He's always there for you, a pillar of support. The same can't be said of our current boyfriend who's never there for you.   So, are you just pals or could he be boyfriend material? Take Dr GetZie's quiz now to find out.       1.  When he walks into a room, you:      a) Challenge him to an arm wrestle.   b) Start gossiping to him about your day.   c) Forget everyone and everything and become totally engrossed in him.      2.  The idea of kissing him makes you think:      a) "Ewww, it would be like kissing my brother."   b) "I've never thought about it, but it might be nice."   c) "I think about it constantly and would love to try it."      3.  You receive a phone call from your boyfriend. You:      a) Tell your guy friend straight away. You grumble about your bf and how he has no time for you.   b) Tell him, but leave out all the juicy details. You gotta keep some things private.   c) Don't tell him. You don't want him to know about any other guys in your life.      4.  He gets a girlfriend. You feel:      a) Happy for him. It's about time he got a nice girl.   b) Happy for him but a little disappointed, because now you won't be able to hang out as much.   c) Hurt and jealous. How dare she move in on your "friendship".      5.  Someone mistakes the two of you for an item. You are:      a) Horrified. How could anyone ever think you two could be an item?   b) Humoured. It happens all the time and you both always joke about it.   c) Flattered. The two of you look pretty damn good together.      6.  The two of you are going to catch an afternoon movie. You:      a) Dress down. You're cool with him seeing you at your daggiest.   b) Go comfy... just like you would to meet any friend at the movies.   c) Make yourself look like a total babe. It wouldn't hurt to impress him.     Leave your answers and email via the COMMENT button. You will receive a personalised analysis from the Love Doctor.   EDIT: Ok, after some feedback, i realised that some of you are pretty shy and want some privacy. Email me your answers directly and I'll churn out the results for you. If you havent got my email, then i guess u'll just have to leave a comment then.  Dr GetZie _ _ _ _ Schooled in the art of love

      Don't speak the language? Here's a concise overview on the nutz and boltz of an IPO process. Soon, you'll be speaking like a REAL Investment Banker ! (Unfortunately its all pretend, you'll wouldnt be getting their fat pay cheques) Here's some phrases you can use to impress your mates down at the clark quay pubs.   IPO : Initial Public Offering A process by which a company makes the transition from a privately held entity to a public listed company on a major stock exchange.   Underwriter : Investment Bank assisting the issuing company with the pricing and marketing of the stock offering.  Lead underwriter / Syndicate : Sometimes, an IPO maybe too large (ie too high market capitalisation) for a single bank to handle. Hence there one main bank handling the IPO (Lead underwriter) and the other group of banks participating in the deal are called the "syndicate".  Beauty Contest / Bake-off : The process when an Investment Bank is competing with other banks for the issuing company's business  Road Show : It is an essential part of the issuing company's marketing campaign where it pitches its business plan to potential investors (usually instituional, mutual funds, endownments, pensions).   Book Building : During and after the road show,the "book-building" process starts. The lead underwriter surveys potential investors and notes the interest in the stock so that it can price the IPO accordingly.   Offering Price : The issuing company and the lead underwriter meet to set the "offering price" and the number of shares to be issued at the offering, based on the expected demand for the stock.  The objective is to balance the co's desire to price the stock to raise as much funds as possible, vs the investor's reward for taking on the risk.   The "POP" vs "money left on the table" :  The "pop" refers to the first day price spike. It is the difference between the offering price of an IPO stock and its closing price on the day of trading.  The "money left on the table" is the pop multiplied by the number of shares sold . You can view it as the money in the hands of investors rather than in the co's coffers.  Finally, we have the "lock up period" : This is the period in which company insiders are prohibited from selling their shares.  Ok, now you can throw these jargons and sound like a real pro. Next up in this series, I will talk about the various financial ratios and how to spot an undervalued stock.

      Dear Class,   For our English lesson today, we shall be turning our attention to the word "fling"  fling    ( P )   urlLink Pronunciation Key    (flng) v. flung, (flng) fling·ing, flings   To throw with violence: flung the dish against the wall. See Synonyms at throw.   To throw (oneself) into an activity with  abandon and energy .  To cast aside; discard:  fling propriety away .   noun.   The act of flinging.  A brief period of  indulging one's impulses .  A brief  sexual or romantic relationship .   The word fling is an action word often used to convey strong emotions. Eg. when the word fling is used as a noun, it is used to describe the indulgment of one's impulses and/or a brief sexual/romantic relationship.  Now for the purpose of discussion we will look at the latter useage of the noun. " A brief period of  indulging one's impulses .  A brief  sexual or romantic relationship . "  As humans, we have needs and wants and this is well expounded by Maslow's Hierarchy. It is but natural for us to indulge in what pleases us, to give in to our impulses. However as homo sapiens, we have been given the ability to think and discern.  Occasionally, we use logic to over-ride our emotions. Thus we control our impulses and forfeit the luxury of indulgence.   The converse is also true. Sometimes emotions are strong and the lure of self gratification takes over the logical mind. We thus ignore all the warning signs and dive impulsively in search of instant gratification.  The above is very true of romantic/sexual flings. And by definition, it always tends to be "very brief".  It is thus obvious that when it comes to flings, the end result is undeniably a mixture of intense sexual/romantic experiences albeit short lived.  A relationship on the otherhand suggests a longer term experience, though less intense in nature.  Which do you prefer ?   A short but intensely hedonistic wanton experience in a fling OR  A longer term less intense more stable but boring and predictable relationship ?  Blog your comments pls   GetZie _ _ _ _ I want to love first, and live incidentally.

      Prologue: 3AM It was 3AM when i first started writing this entry. Just as i was about to post it, i clicked the wrong button and shut down the entire window instead. Shitz. Now i'll have to rewrite it all over again.   3.30AM It's 3.30 AM and i am still awake. I think it's becoz i am stressed. Very stressed, highly stressed. Highly confused as well. It's time to rant. Period.  Text: A. Career Time for career change. But which one ? Will i get my "dream job" ? Very often the dream turns into a nitemare and aint tt pleasant no more. I hate job adverts - they tend to misrepresent the true nature of the job. I hate HR Managers as well, esp those who are smooth talkers. They have this bad habit of not knowing the actual job scope yet speaking with such authority and making promises which they know can never be fulfilled.   B. Relationship Status : Confused  4 AM Alas alas, i feel that an exposition of sleep has come upon me. I have exhausted myself. It is now time to lay my head upon the soft down pillow, to shut my weary eyes and drift into deep slumber...

      This blog was first set up 15th June 2004 at 12nn.  (If you're sharp enough, you'll notice tt it was set up mid day, on the middle day of the month in the middle of the year.)  Heh, ok the title is just a taster of what to expect from this blog. I'm afraid i am not a very good writer. I'm more of a verbal person than a writer. I kinda enjoy writing sentences where you have to read between the sentences to pick up subtle hints and insinuations. I read widely and am up to date with current affairs, so sometimes i may write about current events and you might need to know the background before u can understand my point. I tend to have a dark side of humour as well.   Hey..if you're still reading this WELL DONE MATE.   This blog came about because i want a written record of my thoughts, feelings and emotions as i go through life. I've pretty much forgotten wat i did in my teenage years, perhaps for the very better to save myself from embarrasment.  Bewarned, this blog is going to be brutally honest. Content may include sexual references and adult material. So stay out if you're below the age of 18.   'Nuff said, let the words flow.

      Time flies. I'm now starting on my 2nd week of training. The first week was pretty much an induction, introductory week. Spent the first half of the week meeting the country management team (including the CEO),&nbsp; the various group heads (C&I, Global Markets, PFS, Credit Risk..etc.),&nbsp;various key&nbsp;contacts in HR and&nbsp;of course, people from the branch networks (BM and area managers).  I guess what impressed me was that &nbsp;HR actually invested so much time and effort into organising induction week. I cannot think of any other company where the top brass including the CEO, COO and management team actually makes the effort to come down and welcome us, and have tea sessions so that we can introduce ourselves. Since i belong to the PFS group, (Personal Financial Services aka Consumer Banking), the branch managers as well as other senior managers threw a buffet dinner party for us. The branch managers all looked so young...most of them were early 30s...i guess this shows how dynamic the banking sector has become. Promotion is based on performance and scorecard, no longer on seniority. Of course, there were the oldie rank n file managers who rose through the ranks, but judging from what i saw, that seems to be a rare lot.   Another area which impressed me was the fact that each of us had a dedicated HR Relationship Manager! Its like if we need anything, we'll just give our HR RM&nbsp;a call and she'll sort everything out for us! So cool right....its just like being a Priority/Premium Account&nbsp;Member!  Another area I'm really looking forward to is the rotation. I'll be rotating amongst the different functions within the PFS group. My HR RM is in the midst of arranging brief stints with marketing, operations, wealth management, call centre. At the end of all my training, i'll be posted to a certain branch for more OJT.   Work has certainly taken on&nbsp;a whole new meaning and direction. For a change, I'm actually excited about turning up for work! Maybe its still early days at training, hopefully this enthusiasm still stays after 6 months !  Will keep you faithful friends updated...  Till then...  _ _ _ _ _ GetZie  Gravity doesn't exist, the earth sucks.

        Corporate Lesson 1      A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. After a few seconds of arguing over which one should go and answer the doorbell, the wife gives up, quickly wraps herself up in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next-door neighbour. Before she says a word, Bob says, "I'll give you $800 to drop that towel that you have on." After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands&nbsp;naked in front of Bob. After a few seconds, Bob hands her 800 dollars and leaves. &nbsp;Confused, but excited about her good fortune, the woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets back to the bathroom, her husband asks from the shower, "Who was that?" &nbsp;"It was Bob the next-door neighbour," she replies. "Great!" the husband says, "Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?"  &nbsp;  Moral of the story: If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk in time with your stakeholders, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.     Corporate Lesson 2      A priest was driving along and saw a nun on the side of the road. He stopped and offered her a lift which she accepted. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to open and reveal a lovely leg. The priest had a look and nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. &nbsp;The nun looked at him and immediately said, "Father, remember Psalm 129?" The priest was flustered and apologized profusely. He forced himself to remove his hand. Changing gear, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again said, "Father, remember Psalm 129?" Once again the priest apologized: "Sorry sister but the flesh is weak." Arriving at the convent, the nun got out gave him a meaningful glance and went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to retrieve a bible and looked up Psalm 129. It Said,  "Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory."

      A friend of mine has been busy with her MSc research project and thesis for the past 12 months.  She works just about 7 day weeks, 12 hour days. It doesnt help that the lab work she does has time constraints. Apparentlyfor her lab work&nbsp;she has to stick to a rigid schedule with a 4,8,12 hr experiment interval. Poor girl, she lives day by day, hour by hour. If she misses a single interval, she'll have to repeat the experiment again.   That's what i call living day by day. You're existing merely to chalk up days towards your life existence. Its an occupational hazard for her. But she enjoys it. She gets satisfaction from knowing that her work may lead to a medical cure.&nbsp; But the cost is great. She doesnt spend time with her family. Let alone her boyfriend.&nbsp;She's aware that they are drifting apart,&nbsp;on the rare occasions when they actually meet, it feels&nbsp;weird, almost like strangers.&nbsp;She has aged dramatically, and has lost at least 10kg due to poor nutrition and irregular meals.   Dear friends, I know its not easy balancing work with the demands of life. I find it very difficult myself. I just wanna remind all of you that WORK does not and need not&nbsp;rule your life. Don't give up everything, save abit of yourself for your loved ones. They too need you to be around them.  Add life back to your days, NOT days to your life.

       Felt lost and aimless recently ?  &nbsp;  Go ahead, do something stupid.  &nbsp;  Yes, tt's right, break out of your daily norm! Call in sick, skip work and just go shopping. If you're financially skint&nbsp;(like me),&nbsp; go down to the beach for a jog. Alternatively, hop over to your partners place and shag like rabbits.  &nbsp;  Just do SoMeThInG DiFfErEnT and IrRaTiONaL.  &nbsp;  PERIOD.  &nbsp;  You need to clear your head. You need to shake off all your emotional/physical/workplace baggage. Lose yourself, and you will find yourself again.&nbsp; Dun really get what I'm saying ? Read on...  &nbsp;  You see in life, we are all too busy getting on with our carefully arranged schedule. We prioritise everything. EVERYTHING. Lunch is fixed strictly between 12-1pm. We no longer eat when we are hungry. We eat just because we're scheduled to eat. We list down our priorities and rank them according to urgency and we then meticulously set about striking them off, only to find the list getting longer and longer.  &nbsp;  You see my friend, we&nbsp;have been&nbsp;conditioned by society to think and behave like robots. I bet you probably didnt realise it until today. The lunch exampe is a perfect illustration of how we are programmed to behave not because we want to eat, but because we have to follow the rules and eat within the stipulated hours. Having been used to such "conditioning", its only natural that we start to lose our personality and characteristics.  &nbsp;  We go about doing what we have gotta do diligently, casting aside our emotional, spiritual and physical needs. We stop calling our loved ones during office hours, simple because during office hours we are rushing to finish our TO-DO list for the day. We avoid evening dates with the bf/gf simply because we can never commit to an appointment. We dun go home till the work is done.  And then we are back in the office again next morning 8.15AM SHARP. Becoz we are expected to be in 15 mins earlier.  &nbsp;  Screw the system. Screw it. Take time out to rediscover yourself. You can't please everyone so hey, just start with pleasing yourself first. Afterall, charity starts at home. Sorry, i aint no Superman. I wear my&nbsp;CK boxers&nbsp;on the inside.&nbsp;(Neither do I&nbsp;have a pair of red briefs)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Don't lose focus of your life. Don't lose your focus on love.  &nbsp;  Again let me repeat this, dun live up to other's expectations of you. Just&nbsp;concentrate on living&nbsp;your own life. Make love like there's no tomorrow. Run as if you've just seen the devil.  &nbsp;  It's good to take a break from the daily rituals of slogging at the office. From the incessant nagging and responsibilities at home. Its good to lose yourself and find yourself again.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We're all humans.....give me a break !  &nbsp;  _ _ _ _  GetZie

      The beauty of a woman  Is not in the clothes she wears,  The figure that she carries,  Or the way she combs her hair.   The beauty of a woman  Must be seen from her eyes,  They are the windows to her soul,  Hold her, kiss her - be bold !   The beauty of a woman  Lies not in a facial mole,  But true beauty in a woman  Is reflected in her soul.   It is the caring she lovingly gives,  The Passion that she shows.&nbsp;  My love for&nbsp;this beauty&nbsp;grows ...  _ _ _ _  GetZie

      Ok this is getting out of hand. GetZie has had her 2nd modification. I've installed an adjustable GT WING SPOILER on her. For those uninitiated, a wing spoiler is fitted on the rear end of the car (or the rear roof in the case of Getzie being a hatchback.)It helps increase downward pressure on the car as speed increases, thereby reducing drag and making the car more stable at higher speeds. BUT the main reason why people install it is for aesthetic reasons. Seriously, with speed limits of 50 and 90 km/h, how much faster can you go?  Made a reservation for a new leather sports steering wheel as well. Bought an Apexi decal as well. Was supposed to fit window rain visors but coz it was raining today, the workshop couldnt put it on in time. The modding bug has bitten.   Let the mods begin.   _ _ _ _ _ GetZie

      Baby dearest had her first mod today. Bernard from Getzclub.com came down to my workplace and fixed a  urlLink K&N  panel airfilter.   Here's a list of the benefits :   1. High Air Flow with Excellent Filtration  2. Designed to Increase Horsepower and Acceleration  3. Washable and Reusable   Driving home today, I noticed a remarkable difference. REMARKABLE. The engine was breathing better and was revving up the range smoothly. Throttle response was quick without the usual lag. The induction noise led to a deep burble as i rev the accelerator. WOW. Since it revs much better, I am picking up speed much quicker as well. EXCELLENT !  The MOD bug has bit me...stay tuned. Next on the list is a GT WING SPOILER and a sleek $400 MOMO steering wheel.   _ _ _ _ _ GetZie

      Sept 11 2001. A plane piloted by terrorists crashed into the world trade centre killing approximately 6,000 people in New York City. Newspaper headlines around the world called it a tragedy, wreaths and trinklets were laid on the ruins of the WTC in memory of the unknowns who died. The world was in mourning for these 6,000 individuals.    Here's a little known fact: In 1995, there were some 27 million licensed and 20 million unlicensed abortions carried out worldwide. The next census will only be carried out in 2005, experts are predicting a 30% increase in figures. These figures are in the public domain, a quick search on "abortion statistics" on google will churn out 441,000 pages.  YET, nobody is calling this a tragedy. Somehow, such statistics has yet to find its way onto the cover page of TIME or NEWSWEEK. Lets not even mentioned the local dailies.   There's something wrong with the world today.   _ _ _ _ GetZiE

      By Daniel Beddingfield  If you’re not the one then why does my soul  feel glad today? If you’re not the one then why does my hand  fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart  return my call If you are not mine would I have the strength  to stand at all  I never know what the future brings  But I know you are here with me now We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it,  I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart  tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  If I don’t need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don’t need you then why does your name  resound in my head? If you’re not for me then why does this distance  maim my life? If you’re not for me then why do I  dream of you as my wife?  I don’t know why you’re so far away  But I know that this much is true We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you’re the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life  ‘Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it  takes my breath away And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the  strength to stand today ‘Cause I love you, whether it’s wrong or right And though I can’t be with you tonight And know my heart is by your side                          ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  When I first heard this song, I was like WOW. I was driving along the Clifton Downs (Bristol, UK) in my red MR2 and i stopped by the roadside to listen. This song had me completely mesmerised. It reminded me of how precious, wonderful and soul stirring love is.     Love is a strong emotion. It causes grown man to cry, wars fought and turns friends into foes. I feel that this song is talking about  forbidden love. The kind of love which isnt suppose to happen ?   ‘Cause I love you, whether it’s wrong or right And though I can’t be with you tonight And know my heart is by your side  _ _ _ _ GetZie
