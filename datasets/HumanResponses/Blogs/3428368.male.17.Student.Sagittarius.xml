      oh man, didnt get 2 post any stuff yesterday cuz i was so tired after helping out for four straight hours at a charity fair organised by my church...i crashed at 8p.m. n unbelievably slept like a log until 8 the next mornin...this was a real surprise 4 me..i've never slept for twelve hours before...man, thank God u couldnt see my pathetic-lookin face when i finally decide 2 crawl of my warm bed 2 go to college to bury myself again under a book n sleep again..my hair was really tousled til u'd think i was a far-off cousin of Shaun Ewe (if u know him,that is =), i had fascinating creases on my face that came as a result of my performing yoga when i sleep..if u know what i mean, heh heh.. =P  anyways, yesterday's charity fair was very interestin...got 2 meet up wth several new n old friends..it's rather fun 2 mess around manning the game stalls..i was in charge of the duckies..nyuk nyuk.. =) the game is for those under twelve so u can say that i had 2 cater for all those little kiddies who wanted some clean fun n some goodies 4 their little grubby hands.. =) well, by the time i got home, all my joints were creaking n straining to pop out..ahh, the things we do for charity.. *big GRIN*  so, gonna get back 2 studying in the coll lib..there's where i'm typin this.. =) i know, i know..i'm a real bad boy but heck! i'm only goin 2 live this life of mine once so why waste it on dry pursuits such as learning? i think i consider myself as a connoisseur of the finer things of life.. =) why not soar in the pleasures that life can offer like bein wth close friends both of the fairer kind n my kind?  hmm?  who knows? urs truly, me

Damn!..next is my whole collection of books galore from sci-fi to fiction n what have you..unfortunately for me, this entire paper stash is right next 2 my study table so i think u'll know what i'll resort 2 when i get bored of readin chem equations or crap like that.. =) *guilty grin*..well, now i hope u c what's my problem..n i really cant hav the hope that i'll ace my AS thanks 2 this innumerable factors plaguing me..oh yeah, after books is movies n after watchin movies (i cant wait for spiderman2 to get into theatres!!) is pc games (Unreal tournament 2004 rules!)....and the list goes on n on...  ergo, i hav 2 stop my pursuit of all those listed above if i want 2 fulfil my pipe-dreams of bein a doctor.. =)..what the heck! if worse comes to worse, i can always swallow my pride n bcome a psychologist.. =)who knows? i for one dont know anythin about my future..  well, gotta go..til next time folks..  urs truly, me

      do u know sumthing? i dont really know anything but heck, one thing we do know 4 sure is that we instinctively fear pain...in my experience, i try 2 avoid all pain whether physical or emotional n mental as well..  hav i not buried my pain deep within as if they're never there? this state of anesthesia has pervaded my soul til i begin to panic when there's nothin or nobody left 2 distract me..  when i hav no project 2 finish, no friend 2 visit, no book 2 read, no television 2 watch, no cd 2 play, n when i'm left all alone by myself, i'm brought so close 2 the revelation of our basic human aloneness...i'm scared as heck of experiencing an all-pervasive sense of loneliness that i'll do anythin 2 get busy again n continue the rat race that comforts me 2 blieve that everythin is fine after all...  n so, like the Energizer bunny, i just keep goin n goin n goin, but even the bunny cant go on 4ever, mayb a littl longer than its competitors, but definitely not 4ever..sooner or later it has 2 stop, just as sooner or later u n i hav 2 stop...  urs truly, me =)

      i may never c tomorrow; there's no written guarantee n things that happened yesterday belong to history i cannot predict the future, i cannot change the past i hav just the present moment, i must treat it as my last  i must use this moment wisely for it soon will pass away n b lost forever, as part of yesterday i must exercise compassion, help the fallen to their feet b a friend unto the friendless, make n empty life complete  the unkind things i do today may never b undone n the friendships that i fail to win may nevermore b won i may not hav another chance on bended knees to pray n i thank God wth a humble heart 4 givin me this day  urs truly, me

      life isnt about keepin score it's not about how many friends i hav or how accepted i m not about if i hav plans this weekend or if i'm alone it isnt about who i'm datin, who i'd used to date or how many people i've dated, or if i havent been wth anyone at all it isnt about who my family is or how much money they hav, or what kind of car i driv, or where i was sent to school it's not about how ugly or handsome i m, or what clothes i wear, what shoes i hav on, or what kind of music i listen to it's not about if my hair is black, blonde, red or brown or if my skin is too light or too dark not about what grades i get, how smart i m, how smart everyone else thinks i m, or how smart standardized tests say i m it's not about what clubs i'm in or how good i m at sports it's not about representing my whole being on a piece of paper and seein i'll 'accept the written me'  but,  life is about who i love n who i hurt it's about who i make happy or unhappy purposefully it's about keepin or betrayin trust it's about friendship, used as a sanctuary or as a weapon it's about what u say n mean, mayb hurtful, mayb heartening about startin rumours n contributin to petty gossip it's about what judgements u pass n y n who ur judgements r spread to it's about who i've ignored wth full intention n motive it's about jealousy, fear, ignorance, n revenge it's about carryin inner hate or love, lettin it grow n spreadin it  but,  most of all, it's about usin my life to touch or poison other people's hearts in such a way that could never hav occured alone only i can choose the way those hearts r affected, n those choices r what life's all about...  urs truly, me =)

      hola, it's me again...news-flash! joel is so bored that he's relegatin the better part of an hour 2 typin his pathetically limited thoughts down in this blog of his...what m i thinkin? nothing much really..i was simply wondering how long this torture of studyin has 2 last..i know, i know, probably my whole life..after all, as some wise-@$$ folks say; learning is n ongoing process.. *grimaces*  this is the truth about life: you have two choices ~ you can either go through life dwelling on everything, letting every bad thing that happens bring you down that much more, letting everytime someone hurts you, everytime someone lets you down, everytime someone doesn't care when they say they do - you can let that all ruin you...you can let it tear you apart inside..heck!it's easy too...or, you can take the high road: you can look back on high school, on the mean things you've done, on the mean things people have done to you, and you can try to learn something...you can learn lots from your past if you're willing to just look...i've learnt not to let the fact that i think someone's smarter than me, make me think they're better than me...i've learnt no matter how beautiful someone is on the outside, that's nothing next to being a caring, warm, friendly, comforting, reliable, trustworthy person...i've learnt never to let go of what i really believe, to never give in to people who don't want anything but the best for me. i've learned that in this world, there's only one person i'm responsible for, one person i can change, one person i can always count on - me....=)   urs truly, me

      heh heh..got screwed by the college guard cuz he in turn got screwed by the principal cuz that 'important' dude saw me drivin my car in the opp direction of the normal traffic flow in the college grounds.. =P well, cant help it but i was in a hurry the last few days...the reasons r of cuz varied but in general, i was a little blur... =) what can i say? As usual, i've been spending half my wakin hours in the coll library doin my usual crap that passes off for studyin...i'm beginning 2 entertain a lastin grudge against chemistry...heck! i'm certain that quite a number of guys n gals might share the same views as urs truly...  oh yeah, yesterday i had the pleasure n privilege of takin a close friend out for lunch...suffice 2 say that i'm not 'queer', really enjoyed myself..such friends r rarely found n mayb i'm just struck gold in findin that particular friend, thank God for small miracles... =) now, i've gotta get back to my most favourite pastime of all..*drumroll*..STUDYIN!! =P bye 4 now..  urs truly, me =P

      Hav u ever realized that people always create a there instead of a here...for example, u r on a hike and u have a destination of geting there (the top of the hill) so u make it your point, once i get there i'll b happy, but then u get there and soon u realize that ur here has vanished and u create another there, once i get back i'll b happy, n once u get there....it's the same, u create another there....humans are like this they're never here, there always there. so u have to realize that ur whole life will be a there when u have to live now n not later....u must stop living there and start living here, or ur life will pass u by, and u'll b still living in a there world until u die, so what da heck m i talking about?!  oh well, that's all 4 now.. urs truly,  me =)

      is everythin screwed up or is it just my screwed-up perception acting up on me? heck, i think i'm the one to blame cuz i'm definitely having big, enormous, world-shaking, insurmountable problems here...i simply cant concentrate on my chemistry enough.. =( well, guess i might hav overstated my problems a teeny little bit but it's still a big heck of a problem to urs truly..i mean, come on..a future med student havin study problems is a sure prerequisite for disaster ahead..already i can feel deep within the chemical precursors that signify the decision to quit medicine..after all, the world is only an illusion, 'maya' to our mortal lives..it is what we do in our lives that shall echo throughout eternity.. =) mayb i should apply for the post of the Architect.. =P then i might b able 2 control the external factors of my pathetic joke of a life... =)  to my dear reader, pls bear with my melodramatic style of writin n we shall see how this big fat worm of a joel metamorphoses into a....err...who knows? just wait n see..  urs truly, me =)
