      In the Social Studies I Competency Goals for Special Education students at the high school level "Student must demonstrate an understanding of the three branches of the federal government and their functions."  The Textbook I use in class addresses this in 3 simple pages in chapter 7 section 4. As we talked before texts do not address topics in enough depth. I have found three websites that will serve as additional teaching aids in helping my students understand the branches of the federal government.  The Truman Presidential Museum and Library http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher_lessons/3branches/1.htm  urlLink Cool link  Takes the reader through each branch of the federal government, what each is responsible for, what makes up each branch and the checks and balances that exist between each one. This site also has short question sections for the reader.  These question sections range from simple fill in the blank to short answers.  I usually spend a lot of my planning looking for more in depth questions to help my students understand the branches.  This site is interactive and has much of what I have done before all rolled into one.  Also, my students enjoy spending time in the computer lab because it is individualized and they can move at their own pace  Federal Government Branches- The United States http://www.lawmart.com/federalbranches.htm  urlLink Cool link  This website links you to the official websites for each branch of the federal government.  I like being able to use this website because my students can use this site to improve their internet skills as they search for specific information.  For example who are the US Senators from North Carolina?, How many cabinets are there in the executive Branch? How many woman are on the Supreme Court? and many other questions.  My students love to use the internet, but lack in certain retrieval skills that they made need to survive in the real world when they graduate.  Ben's Guide to US Government for Kids grades 6-8 http://bensguide.gpo.gov/6-8/government/branches.html  urlLink Cool link  I like this site because it is written to make sense to a middle school mind.  Most of my students operate at or near this level. I like the way that this site is able to go in depth with the different branches while at the same time not confusing the reader.  Many of the ideas or topics listed are things I have searched for in the past, but have trouble with the concepts getting to deep and for my students. urlLink   urlLink

      One of the most important decisions that students will make in their lifetimes is what their career will be.  In order to make those decisions, they need to learn about themselves - their abilities and talents.  They need to know what careers are available.  These websites will help begin this process.  The website  urlLink www.princetonreview.com  has many resources.  I especially like under that under the career heading there is career quiz that is very simple (only 24 questions) but gives students a printout that is color coded with possible career options.  The website  urlLink www.scois.org  has a section termed Your Pathways to Success which has activities for learning about different careers.  The website  urlLink www.jobprofiles.monster.com  also gives great profile information about possible careers.

      Unit III: Electronic Resources   urlLink Check out this link  Musuem of Tolerance: Children of the Holocaust  This site will enable students to see first hand what happened to children during the Holocaust.  The students will be assigned to read several biographies of children who survived the holocaust.  I will then give them the assignment of writing a bio-poem for a child of their choice.  They will have to type this poem using Microsoft Word and include a picture of their child.  I will then hang these pictures up on the bulletin board in the classroom.   urlLink Check out this link  Elibrary  Nigeria: Chapter 1E. Popular Disillusionment and Political Realignment; Robert Rinehart Countries of the World   01-01-1991 I will use this article to help the students understand the background for the story “In the Shadow of War” from their textbook.  I will have them read this article and highlight what they think is important.  After reading and highlighting, I will ask each student to come up to an overhead and write one important thing from the article to share with the class.  We will discuss what the students come up with.   urlLink Check this link out  It is very important to relate the war and peace theme for this lesson to what is going on today in Iraq.  The BBC News carries excellent news coverage, updated each day that will help the students see how war is affecting the Iraqi people.  I want them to understand that we are lucky to be in a country that for so long has been safe from war.  This site always includes facts about daily life in Iraq, information about the rebuilding of Baghdad, and many personal stories from all sides. I will take my students to the computer lab and have them explore this site.  They will be required to write journal responses to two personal stories and also give me a statistical view of life in Iraq.  Everything they need to provide me with these assignments is included on this site.

      The lesson I am planning involves teaching the importances of being physically fit. I plan to do this by using the textbook Health: A Guide To Wellness, the internet sources that I have picked out for them, and my own personal experinces. In making this plan, I hope that each student will benefit from having learned the material and be able to apply the knowledge that was given to them to their everyday life.  I have compiled some internet sources for the students to work with. I personally have been to every site and approve of them because each site has valuable information.   urlLink Check this site out   This site is a Georgia State University site that is simply titled The Exercise & Physical Fitness Page. It contains exercise program information. It involves the different types of exercise, the importance of warming up, the importance of nutrition, and other important factors in doing an exercise program. Their goal is to provide research based exercise and fitness information.   urlLink Check this site out   This site is developed by the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. It is titled Fitness Fundamentals:Making a Commitment. It covers everything you need to know about making an exercise program and all of the things included in making an exercise program.   urlLink Check out this site   This site covers the five basic components of physical fitness. It has several other links published on the page that enable the reader to explore more options that go along with physical fitness.  I plan to have the students go to each one of these sites and compare and contrast each site to the other. I will then have them compare that to the material in the textbook. They will list some of the same points each text covers and list some differences. After they understand the components of exercise I will have them make their own exercise program using the information that was given to them.

      Chapter 7 in my Sixth Grade Math book (Prentice Hall) and also Chapter 7 in my Community College text (Basic College Mathematics) both deal with statistics. As the word "statistics" scares students of all ages, I plan to use these three sites as a fun way to introduce the concepts of   mean, median,   and   mode   to my students.   Weather Today by BBC Education (Activity, Fact Sheet, ONLINE test)  Of the three sites, this is the easiest, giving very simple explanations and easy problems. I would use this as either the starting point for everyone or as an effective remediation tool for those who do not grasp concepts easily. urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/revisewise/maths/data/   AAA Statistics This site is my second choice because it moves students up a level. First they see a mini lesson, then they scroll down to a practice area where their reponses are given immediate feedback. Within this same framework is a series of "beat the clock" games to challenge learners further. Lastly, even greater ability can be coaxed from the student as he/she decides whether to perform   mean, median,    or   mode   as 1,2, or 3 digit operations. urlLink http://www.aaamath.com/B/sta.htm   Train Race Activity  by BBC Maths File ( need to use own calculator with this)  This site ranks as my highest level due to the applicational level of requirement. Students must know their terms as no lessons are offered, then they must determine central tendencies of trains in order to place their passenger on the CORRECT train before it departs the station. Overall, the highest orders of thinking are applied to this game.   urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/mathsfile/shockwave/games/train.html

      Principles of Business VoCATS Objective - J. Careers in Business and Marketing PB11.00 - Analyze and develop an individualized career plan. PB12.00 - Demonstrate procedures for obtaining a job.  FYI - I searched for these websites using google, dogpile, and ask.  Site -  urlLink www.topten.org/content/tt.AB8.htm  The Top 10 Tips for a Successful Job Interview website lists and details ten tips for a successful job interview. They are easy to understand and very explanatory. This website covers PB12.03 - Explain etiquette in a job interview.  Site -  urlLink www.collegegrad.com/careers/index.shtml  The Collegegrad website targets college graduates but has career information by industry, salary and hiring trends, free career analysis which matches you with 11-20 jobs, Kiersey Temperament Sorter, resume samples, free templates for letter of application (cover letter) and samples, interview preparation tips, how to dress, entry level questions, after the interview - call interviewer and write a short thank you note. The links for the objectives are on the left side of the screen. This site was very easy to navigate and understand. This website covers PB12.01 - Develop a resume and letter of application, PB12.04 - Create a follow-up (thank-you) letter, PB11.00 - Analyze and develop an individualized career plan, and PB11.01 - Analyze the characteristics, requirements, and availability of careers in business and marketing.  Site -  urlLink http://jobsearchtech.about.com/library/weekly/aa05101.htm  The About website covered resume writing, technical job resumes, entry level resumes, free templates for resumes, job applications, thank you note writing tips, and career planning. This website covered some of the same objectives as the collegegrad but offered different resume styles and general job application tips. The links are located on the left side of the page. This site covers PB12.02 - Complete employment forms necessary for obtaining employment.  Site -  urlLink www.washingtonpost.com/wp-adv/jobs/Career_Advice/impactadvice5.htm  The Washington Post website lists the 18 Deadly Interview Mistakes Job Seekers Make. Some seem silly to those of us who have participated in at least one or more interviews. However, teenagers are new to this task. This site was easy to navigate and easy to read with understandable vocabulary and terms.

      The lesson I am planning could be used in a business financial management class or an introductory lesson for a class on entrepreneurship. It will focus on the creation of a business plan - its parts, their components and its importance to the success of any business.   All businesses, large or small, have a business plan. Currently, 90% of newly created jobs are created by small businesses and 65% of small businesses fail.   The sites will be used to supplement the textbook and allow the students to delve deeper into the creation of a business plan. At the present time, I envision the lesson to include a small group project where each group will be an "angel network" or "venture capitalists", who will review three plans and decide which, if any, plan they would fund and for how much.  Each group will need to create a final report justifying their decision. These reports will be presented by the group to the whole class.   The sites I've chosen are:  urlLink www.sbaonline.sba.gov  This is the website for the Small Business Administration. The site contains useful information and resources for small businesses.   urlLink www.toolkit.cch.com  This is the CCH website. CCH INCORPORATED is a leading provider of business, legal, and tax information and software to the business community. It contains the tools to help start, run and grow a successful small business.   urlLink www.bplan.com/samples/sba.cfm  This site contains sample business plans for small businesses in a variety of industries. Students will be able to review plans for the types of businesses that interest them.   urlLink www.incmagazine.com  This is the website for Inc. magazine, a magazine for entrepreneurs.  Two other sites that could be accessed for articles pertinent to this topic, but are also good resources for business articles in general:  urlLink www.work911.com  This site contains links to over 2000 work related articles.  urlLink www.smartbiz.com  This site has as a tag line "How small businesses get big" and contains links to business related articles that would be of special interest to small business owners.  One final site business teachers and students may find useful:  urlLink www.khake.com  This site has business, management and finance career resources. It has links for career exploration, skills, schools, and job market. It contains links to other sites, articles, search engines, strategies and tutorials.

      The following links were chosen to assist a sixth grade science class in studying the chapter entitled: "Technology and Space Exploration: Past, Present, and Future".  I envisioned an internet research assignment in which a group of students would submit their findings in a class presentation on this chapter addressing one of the following themes:  Discovery, Pioneers, Vision, Equipment.    1.   urlLink        NASA Ames Research Center       Click on the heading: "The Vision for Space Exploration".  This site gives students access to articles, press releases, official statements, video archives, and public addresses.  By accessing these selections they will be exposed to President Bush's vision and statements for America's space program, the vision of NASA's Administrator, and the vision and comments from the NASA Space Commission.  Additionally, there are sites devoted to demonstrations of new technology such as the Personal Exploration Rovers.  2.   urlLink http://btc.montana.edu/ceres/html/EdActivities.html        NASA/MSU-Bozeman CERES Project.       At this site, students have access to classroom activities and projects that expose them to the challenges a person would face as an astronautical scientist.  Each activity is listed by grade level with a description of expected time required and the exact area of space research that is being addressed.  Students would choose from activities such as "First Manned Mission to Mars," "MarsQuest," "Every Picture Tells a Story," and "MountainQuest."    3.   urlLink http://curry.edschool.virginia.edu/go/edis771/webquests2001sp/ssarahsouthall/webquest_student        "Explore Your Universe: A Web Quest for 6th Grade"       This site is devoted to space exploration with an emphasis on discovery.  Students will follow guided instruction within the website to explore the planets, stars, satellites, etc of our solar system.

      My lesson topic is regarding HTML and the basics on how to begin writing Web pages. I personally don't know the code at all; I chose the topic since I had a high school HTML textbook at home on loan from a teacher. The following are websites that I found which may be good to use as resources.   Page Tutorial  urlLink http://www.pagetutor.com/  This particular website,  urlLink PageTutor , is a good online resource for beginners to those who are already familiar with HTML. The user can order the tutorials in written/printed format. In addtion, the site offers both free material as well as more in-depth material for registered users. I would use this website as supplemental material to the Shelly Cashman textbook for those who might find it beneficial or more interesting.   Page Tutorial 2  urlLink http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/tut/  This website,  urlLink Writing HTML , is somewhat similar to the previous one. The website is broken into various lessons, progressing from basic to more difficult. Each begins with a list of objectives. The lessons, themselves, contain numerous headings to break up the text as well as bolded words and hyperlinks within the lesson. In addition, the lessons have review questions at the end. The lessons seem to be very informative, but often contain nothing but text; in other words, some don't contain illustrations which serve visual learners well. I would use this also to supplement the textbook. Students could either use this site or the first one. It's always good to have choices in this world!   Call the Doctor  urlLink http://www2.imagiware.com/RxHTML/  This is a very neat website ( urlLink Doctor HTML ), one that I never knew existed on the Web. This is a Web page analysis tool that examines a particular Web page for any errors. The site will provide the user with information on how to improve his/her page. In addition, the user can select the various diagnostic tools that he/she wants to use. In other words, the user can direct the site to check for certain errors while ignoring others. This would be great for those just learning the code. Errors are a near certainty. Students could use this when their Web page will not run properly, and they are unable to find the error.

      I found three differnet sites that will be perfect for helping the students understand Algebra.  However, the students can continue to use the site for further Math classes dealing with different parts of Algebra. I have listed the web sites and I will describe how I will use them in my lesson.  urlLink  http://www.mathleague.com/help/algebra/algebra.htm .   This site provides vocabulary words associated with Algebra.  Also, this stie gives differnet types of examples for the terms that will be used.  I thought, I would use the site for a steady base on getting to know some of the concepts of algebra.  The students will use it as a resource before jumping into algebra, the students will use this site to look up basic vocabulary words before being introduced to the concepts.  The reason for doing it is to have them come in with some understanding of algebra.  As we start out, the studnets will not be in the dark.   urlLink http://www.algebrahelp.com/index.jsp   This site will be helpful for the students outside of the classroom.  This site has all different kinds of ways for the students to understand the concepts.  Since the site has different ways of looking a the concepts, the students will be able to connect the information in class and other information together.  This might give the students a better understanding of the material. It has different kinds of games the studnet can use to see if he/she understands the concepts.  Also, the site has worksheets the students can work, too.   urlLink http://www.eduref.org/cgi-bin/printless.cgi/Virtual/Lessons/Mathematics/Algebra/ALG...   This site gave me an idea on introducing algebra to the students without causing them to get anxious about the subject.  It gives ideas on ways students can think about the dreadful world of algebra. Also, I will be able to use hands on materail for the students to play with.  If they are able to see and touch the objects being modled than there might be a good starting point for the students.  The studnets are able to work in groups which allow them to learn from others.

      Here are some web resources for my project about autobiographical poetry:   urlLink Poetry Express   poetryexpress.org  This site will form the nucleus of the students' writing phase of the project.  They will work through the "15 poems you can write now" activity as part of their experimentation with autobiographical poetry.     urlLink The Favorite Poem Project  favoritepoem.org  The purpose of visiting this site is to highlight the connection between real life and real poetry.  This project is one in which famous people (and regular people, for that matter) share their favorite poems and tell why they like them.  Students will explore this site and develop some ideas about why some poems are dear to peoples' hearts.     urlLink The Newshour Daily Poem     This daily poetry feature from the Newshour highlights autobiographical poetry.   urlLink

      Hi guys~ Hope all is well with each of you! Here's my list of resources for a study on the Holocaust using Elie Wiesel's "Night" as the reading.  http://www.nizkor.org/ This is a great site with info about every aspect of the Holocaust, it even battles the debate that some believe that it didn't happen. The two main areas that I will be using from this site are the "66 Questions & Answers about the Holocaust" and the area about "The Camps." I am however going to allow the students to roam around this site and look at anything they please but will ask them to concentrate on those 2. This site will be used as a reference to mainly camp information as well as a resource for the students on a final project that they may do. I'll refer to it as " urlLink Everything Holocaust ."   http://www.ushmm.org/outreach/nrule.htm This site deals mainly around the Nazi rulers and the part that they played in the Holocaust. There is a timeline as well as keydates area that I think will be very useful for most students. I also like the fact that there is a glossary on the page. This site throws in every event that was happening during the Holocaust and the affect that it had on it. I like that the articles on the site are "short, sweet, and to the point." I feel that that more students may actually read what they are supposed to and still get the info that I want them to from the little article. I would use this site when teaching about the part that Hitler played as well as to give them a place to go to for dates and terms. I will refer to this site as " urlLink The Nazi ."  http://xroads.virginia.edu/~CAP/HOLO/ELIEBIO.HTM  This last site is a biography on Elie Wiesel. Students would read this site in order to get a sense of the type of person that Elie is instead of just someone who survived the Holocaust and wrote about it. I think the site could give a deeper insight when they read "Night." I'll refer to this site as " urlLink Elie ."

      Greetings fellow Bloggers!  I've tried several times in vain to link the sites from Blogger by following the directions given in "?Help", but it's not making the connection for some reason; I'll try again later.  Nonetheless, I'm going to press on with the assignment.  I will be using the following sites in my research:  http://www.teach-nology.com/teachers/lesson_plans/language_arts/speaking/  I will be referring to this one as the Super Speaker site.  The words " urlLink Super Speaker " will be what you will click on to link to this site once I figure out what the problem is.  This site is incredible.  It is a comprehensive site including many of the important elements of oral communication:  tips on public speaking, interviewing techniques, writing interviews, writing speeches, sample speeches, etc...There are a few sites I will direct the students to from here.  One of them is the "Putting it all Together" site that I indicate at the bottom of this list.  Another one not listed on these top three is a site containing a collection of famous American speeches that I will be directing them to as well.  In addition, I currently plan to give them the freedom to peruse this site for research picks of their own.        http://cspace.unb.ca/nbco/pigs/speaklist/inter1.html  I will refer to this site as the  urlLink Informed Interviewer  site.  This site will be used as a reference for a great class activity where the students will interview a fellow student and then present that person to the class; this exercise should help to "break the ice" before they have to give a speech independently.       http://www.abacon.com/pubspeak/  I will refer to this site as  urlLink Putting It All Together .  I plan on using this site as a sort of WebQuest.  It's very user-friendly and gives the students help by starting with a topic for their speech and then directs them to a finished product.  I don't expect that they will utilize every aspect of this site because it is fairly extensive.  I will help them by pointing out the most helpful aspects.

      hey, i was having a diffcult type figuring out this blog thing.  i final figured it out thanks carol dean.  anyway, when i first read the word blog, i had no clue what it meant. i figured out what it is now  and i think it is something you could use with your class.  They can use to contact another student about some homework or just blow off some steam about a test or something.  the students could use it to ask questions about a topic, so the student wouldn't feel ashamed of the quesion, and no one would know who it was.

       Do you love words and the power of words?    Just want to pass on a website where you can subscribe for free to "A Word A Day". My sister started my subscription a few years ago. Try out  urlLink www.wordsmith.org   Each day you get a new word, its pronunciation, definition, origin, 2 examples of its usage in printed documents, and a quote a day. The website also contains archives by month issued, theme and words. Its been around for ten years.   If you haven't heard of it before, check it out and let me know what you think. -Deb

      What's up with my posts displaying the "delete" and "edit" action on the sides of the subject line? What am I doing wrong in the publishing process?

      Hello classmates! I'm here, I'm late, and for those of you that know me talk way to much.  Probably taking a class that I have to type my thoughts to you will definitely slow down my wandering thoughts.  Good to have you all aboard and hope that we can all learn something from each other.  Until next time  Bill Taylor

      I am here!! I am not sure what I am doing, but I am here! I have never used a blog before. It appears to be much like an interactive Buletin board / chat room service. I think it could be useful for students if managed correctly. They will need detailed instructions about what a blog is and how you wish them to use the blog. My husband says if I see a blog to approach it very carefully and capture it alive if possible. Ha-Ha!! Have a good day! Arlene

      Hi Guys~ I'm still a little lost as to what exactly it is we are supposed to be doing on the blogger site. So I'm just going to go along with what some of the others are doing. I agree that to use a blog in the classroom may be a little difficult unless it is an upper level class such as Jr/Sr high school. An idea on how to use one could be to have discussions on the blog as part of a weekly assignment. They could post their thoughts and ideas about the readings that they have been doing or any questions that they may have. I also really liked the idea that someone else had about the principal using blogs to communicate with teachers. That could definitely be useful. I think it's going to be interesting to see how these blog posts go! I'm looking forward to it. Keli

      I am anxious for the day when I have summers off and don't have to do homework.  These classes are greatly beneficial to my personal and professional development, however; the pool is calling my name and a road-trip sounds good.  I have been able to sleep late once or twice this week.  What a luxury. Actually it is 10:30 and I am still in my pj's.  Does that make me a bum? Have a great summer you guys and gals!  I wonder what my little darlings are doing this summer?    Mary

      Greetings from Outer Space,      This is StarBlog 001, recorded by kitpie13 ( known to some, but not all, as Teresa Wiles). Today is Thursday, July 10, 2004, and we have successfully completed our first mission : to develop a web-based e-mail account. It was with much trepidation that we set forth upon this venture, as it gives the dreaded e-mails even greater vantages from which to strike. Currently e-mails can menace us from six directions at once (2@job#1, 1@job#2, 1@home, 1@ASU, and the last one possesses the ability to attack from any location that is web-accessible). We then performed the bio which was long and grueling, yet strangely addictive. We expect to be forced into feeding our strange fixation at some point in the near future. Our captain has also give the order to create a new creature known as a  Blog , and it comes to life even now. Before the  Blog  overwhelms our dwindling forces, I shall attempt to preserve for posterity my last remaining thoughts... Obviously the Blog could be used as an excellent story starter, with students adding their own endings or being required to continue the story where the last student left off; thus creative writing could be reborn in the classroom. It could also be used as a log for checking and confirming that students are actually using their given times for their individual assignments, such as AR(if someone writes that he/she has read pp.73-80 in his/her library book, then I don't expect to see that person back on pp.66-72). In an assigned class reading, students could make up multiple choice questions with well-written distractors. Each student could compose one question (no duplicate questions allowed), and the teacher could require students to answer x number of questions. This could lead to great discussion in the classroom as students questioned each other or defended their answers. Other thoughts enter my mind, but the  Blog  is greedily consuming them even as it.....consumes....my...brain .(Audience hears a muffled groan,and then a thud as the StarBlog recorder's body hits the floor. The hiss of static is the last thing heard by the audience.)

      Okay, so like when does one know one is blogging? Did I blog when I answered those questions about myself? Am I blogging now? Or, perhaps I'll blog when I look at those websites and comment on them? Wait a minute, I know what bloggy is!  It's that weather condition that necessitates the use of one's low beams.

      When I first saw the assignment, I thought a blogger might be something you smoke (hee heee..) or a virus (i.e. "I have the blog"). However, it is not. I think a blogger could be used effectively for teachers and administrators. Students could edit their profiles so teachers could get to know them on a more personal level. Assignments could be posted. This would be great when weather is bad, a student is absent, or students could work ahead if they knew about a planned absence (i.e. vacation). Principals could communicate with teachers during the school day provided each class has a working computer that does connect to the internet. The Bowman Blog could be a catchy name for my blog.

      A special welcome to Lynn,Chad, Deborah, and Jerry for creating and posting to the class blog.  I must admit that I wondered what we were about to get into when I was asked about "blogging"!!!  I liked your thoughts about how to use a blog.  Do you have any other ideas about how you would use the blog in your classes?  carol deal

      This the first time I ever heard of blogging. With dial-up access you tend not to spend a lot of time conversing over the internet. I still prefer a telephone or face-to-face conversation - you can't read body language or voice inflection in a blog!  It can serve a purpose but too often we get caught up in the technology bells and whistles and we lose sight of the human social interactions that are being replaced by technology connections.

      I must admit that when I saw the directions from the instructor regarding a "blog," I began scratching my head and wondering what the heck she was talking about. I may be a bit behind in this technology-savy world, but I had never heard of it before. After reading further, I discovered that it is very much like a public discussion board or forum...maybe even identical with a unique, eye-catching name for it. I think it's a great idea for people who have similar interests or have some other kind of common bond. I too think it could be a good tool for a class, but it needs to be relevant and useful...not something to use just to say you use it. Teachers must consider the types of, the ages of, and the academic level of students, among other things, before incorporating this resourse, if they want to use it effectively. OK...so I've voiced my opinion and made my post! Now, I'm moving on to something else.  Chad

      I have heard of blogging and have often wondered how one could incorporate this technology into the classroom experience in Language Arts.  It seems as if it would be a wonderful way to inspire reflection and dialogue about interaction with text among students but the big question, as always, would be about making it meaningful.  I have to admit that, with a few notable exceptions, my experiments with technology in the classroom have led to somewhat mixed results.  Students either digress too much or get so excited about the minor points of the process (graphics, sound) that real interaction with the content is remote.  I'm wondering if anyone has successfully incorporated blogging into their content area and, if so, how they did it.    Lynn
