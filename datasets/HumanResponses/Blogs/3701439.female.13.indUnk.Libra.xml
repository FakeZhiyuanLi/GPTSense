      Well I just made the blog, even though I have made about a billion, but I forget about them and make new ones.But its 7:00 in the morning, I woke up at 5:00 because I had to go pee, I stayed up since then, and right when Im about to go to sleep, my mom gets home, and I jump up to that horrible screeching noise the door makes when you open it. So I figured, Im trying to hard, maybe I should just stay up. I waited for a while, waited for my laziness to leave, then I got up and got on the computer and went to go bash hilary Duff. That little bitch needs to die!My cousin drove her car into a lake trying to drown her ears from Hilarys song on the radio. She is so fake! Well anyways, Im bored and there are no good sites to go on this morning. I want to go shopping, or go eat somehting, but I cant get my ass off this damn chair, Im surfing through Blackforest, but no one is on. I want to take a warm shower. I want to clean my room, but my ass wont budge, so I guess not, just forget it. Dude my room is a mess, I want to clean it up so bad right now, I just cant stand having a dirty room. Im probably boring you, If I am then get the fuck out of my blog! I hate Katie Leung. Why does the role of Cho Chang have to be asian, I mean really, why not american! She is going to be able to kss dan to, what is this world coming to!

      This Will Make You Cry...  Jenny was so happy about the house they had found.  For once in her life it was on the right side of town.  She unpacked her things with such great ease.  As she watched her new curtains blow in the breeze.  How wonderful it was to have her own room.  School would be starting; she'd have friends over soon.  There'd be sleep-overs, and parties; she was so happy  It's just the way she wanted her life to be.  On the first day of school, everything went great.  She made new friends and even got a date!  She thought, "I want to be popular and I'm going to be,  Because I just got a date with the star of the team!"  To be known in this school you had to have a clout,  And dating this guy would sure help her out.  There was only one problem stopping her fate.  Her parents had said she was too young to date.  "Well, I just won't tell them the entire truth.  They won't know the difference; what's there to lose?"  Jenny asked to stay with her friends that night.  Her parents frowned but said, "All right."  Excited, she got ready for the big event  But as she rushed around like she had no sense,  She began to feel guilty about all the lies,  But what's a pizza, a party, and a moonlight ride?  Well the pizza was good, and the party was great,  But the moonlight ride would have to wait.  For Jeff was half drunk by this time.  She felt someone remove her from the twisted rubble,  And heard, call an ambulance!  These kids are in trouble!  Voices she heard...a few words at best.  But she knew there were two cars involved in the wreck.  Then wondered to herself if Jeff was all right,  And if the people in the other car was alive.  She awoke in the hospital to faces so sad.  "You've been in a wreck and it looks pretty bad."  These voices echoed inside her head,  As they gently told her that Jeff was dead.  They said "Jenny, we've done all we can do.  But it looks as if we'll lose you too."  "But the people in the other car!? "Jenny cried.  "We're sorry, Jenny, they also died."  Jenny prayed, "God, forgive me for what I've done  I only wanted to have just one night of fun."  "Tell those people's family, I've made their lives dim,  And wish I could return their families to them."  "Tell Mom and Dad I'm sorry I lied,  And that it's my fault so many have died.  Oh, nurse, won't you please tell them that for me?"  The nurse just stood there-she never agreed.  But took Jenny's hand with tears in her eyes.  And a few moments later Jenny died.  A man asked the nurse,  "Why didn't you do your best?"  To bid that girl her one last request?"  She looked at the man with eyes so sad.  "Because the people in the other car  were her mom and dad."
