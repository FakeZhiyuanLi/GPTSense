      Arighty it's time for me to post yet another extremely boring lil paragraph.  Today was school, fun! The days are going by soooo fast! But it's still only the 3rd week or so.  Not that I want school to end, I don't wanna get older! LoL! I'm like the one weird person in all of NRHS who actually doesn't wanna leave highschool---well that's too much talk of future things, lol! Today and yesterday in American History we had a sub, Mrs. Oliver. That lady is SO great! She says things like "Sit Down, Boy!" or other funny things that I can't think of at this moment! We had work to do and then after we just sat around so Neil and I switched calculators nd i played Beer Run on his.  Now that game is the coolest thing ever! You gotta run around and try to get really drunk! You go to parties, get into fights, rob houses---It's SO funny! I only got up to .07% BAC--i suck! Neil got like over 100, LoL! Shows just how educated our youth is today, playing stupid games on calculators! Hm yesterday was boring and I don't even remember what happened so I won't recap that! And Sunday I worked for my dad at the soccer fields with Jenn, Manda, nd Mar. John came to chill with us, and Steward, and Rylan, and then Steven for like a second cuz he was with Steward. Umm...nothing else is goin out except that John's sister thinks that he's in love with me, LoL! It's the funniest thing, she's always like OOOOO NICOLE ur hanging out with my brother---it's like the cutest thing! Well newayz, I'm gonna go study for my Physics test that I'm definetely gonna fail b/c my teacher is an idiot!!!!!! L8a!

      Hey guys n gals! Wooo! So my second blog! SOO exciting I know.  I'm sorry if this site is extremely boring, but I have no idea how to put other cool things on this like pics and other..cool..things, lol. Newayz, I gotta figure that stuff out.  Today was boring I guess.  Got my hair cut, extremely short and my mom hates it. She says I look like a boy, lol. Oh well, I like it a lot so tough luck. After I went to the mall for like a tiny bit and I bought the Jason Mraz cd! I love it! It's so great!!! My fave song is You and I Both.  I've heard it many many times before, but I love it even more now! I also bought Moulin Rouge on video for the low low price of $7!!!!!! YaY!! I love that movie! If you haven't seen it, then watch it! In full too, cuz if u see like the first 15 minutes you're gonna think it's the weirdest thing you've ever seen in your entire life, LoL! Let's c, later Jenn, Manda, n Mar came over.  My parents were going somewhere so we were like trying to get them outta the house, but they didn't end up leaving until like 7. My mom thought we were trying to smuggle guys into the house nd it made me really really sad b/c I wish we had guys to smuggle in! ugh, it's so sad!! So then we had an picnic on the deck, it was so beautiful, but then there was a helicopter and we got really scared because Manda told us something about low flying helicopters n criminals, LoL! so yeah, fun stuff! sry bout this longness! A domani!

      So, yes, my first blog ever! Wooo!! After like an hour of trying to figure out how to make a website on mac.com, I felt bad b/c Jenn was falling asleep so I decided this was my last resort to getting a website.  So basically, guys suck! Hence the name of my page! LoL! (obviously, I have some guy troubles!!)  Well if you don't know me, my name is Nicole, LoL! But you should know me if you're reading this, unless I have a stalker (Jenn has one, LOL, o wait, so does Mar, and she once was one too!).  From this blog you'll mostly learn that I am like the biggest dork that you'll ever meet though u won't quite meet me cuz ur just reading my stupid posts! LoL!

      SoOoO...it's HALLOWEEN!!! boogedy boogedy boogedy! LoL, i'm a dork! nothing fun happened today---the halloween costume competition was good---it was during my lunch so i was so excited, the costumes were great---the tourists, brian baek and some other kid, were awesome---it was the funniest thing ever! i gotta figure out wut i'm gonna b next year, our costumes gotta be kickass, lol! so we still don't kno what to do tonight which is a little sad---we're trying to get invited to john's get-together but he doesn't wanna invite us---well we kinda invited ourselves but after the whole thing last saturday where he didn't invite us over with all his other friends(well i wasn't there cuz i was out with vinny n his hot friends from pennsylvania) i dunno wut's going on---we're going to see texas chainsaw massacre tonight, much later though--me manda n mar saw the one from 1974, it was incredibly cheesy, gay, and gory, but this one's supposed to be better, lol, and jenn's coming! jenn hates scary movies, she was scared in scary movie 3! LoL!! newayz...i was gonna write something else, but i totally forgot wut i was gonna write! 
As of today, my new favorite quote is: Chris: Oh, my dog got skunked and it died. Mrs. Maye: From being skunked? Chris: No! lol, it sounds gay but it was actually really funny

      hey! i've decided that i'm gonna restart this blog! lol, hellz yeah, gettin the party started! i know u all missed me for a month or so---newayz---life has been incredibly uneventful! nothing exciting ever happens around here! ugh....so today was the last day of swimming in gym, i'm gonna miss that! last year it seemed like we swam for so long---this year was so much more fun tho, we got to play water polo and basketball and stuff---it was fun---and plus i had so many great people in my swimming class---including jenn, chris, jared, amanda friedman, natalia, etc etc---it was a fun gym class so....
As of this week, I just don't like: my driver's ed instructor--he def thinks i'm a moron, and i can't understand a word he says, so nething he says i'm like wut?? and he never likes to tell me where he wants me to go, and then he yells at me b/c of it! hello! i don't kno my way around new city, i live in stony point for goodness sake! and then he told me that my driving teacher taught me the wrong way to parallel park! every time i did it with the driving teacher, it was fine, and then this guy makes me park his mondo-ly large car and i couldn't do the way my private teacher taught me, so now he thinks i'm an idiot
As of today, my new fave quote is: "She may be the hottest girl that I've ever hated."---Joey from Friends...lol i heard it and i just had to write it in this blog, haha
alright, i gotta do hw, night night

This would be a song that describes my life(well, if it were a girl singing this song): You say you love me, but you can not leave him so now I'm leaving you for this here same reason. Cause times change and so do the seasons, and the seasons change. So I listen to what you say, but I don't believe a word you say. You say you love me, but you can not leave him so now I'm leaving you for this here same reason. Cause times change and so do the seasons, and the seasons change. So I listen to what you say, but I don't believe a word you say.
I just wanted to get over you, but I can't stop thinking about you. Not a second goes by that you're not in my head. You dick me over again and again, but I still remained your friend. It's time for this to end. You say you love me but you can not leave him, so now I'm leaving you this here same reason. Cause times change and so do the seasons, and the seasons change. Will you still love me tomorrow? For way too long you fucked with my mind, I've sang this song way too many times, and you need to know it's gone on for too long. Thought it would be just the two of us in the end, but now I'm leaving and you're not even my friend. Was the way you felt for real? You say you love me but you can not leave him, so now I'm leaving you for this here same reason. Cause times change and so do the seasons, and the seasons change. Will you still love me tomorrow? Tonight i felt the love in your eyes. Will you still love me tomorrow? You say you love me, but you can not leave him, so now I'm leaving you this here same reason. Cause times change and so do your feelings, and your feelings changed. And will he love me tomorrow? Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.... "Reason" by Mest

Dereck(said in a very strange accent): I came with...I dunno! And I'm leaving with...I dunno!! (LOL it was funnier if u were there cuz he was playing some game called see-lo with ian n conor cuz they gave up on the superbowl and dereck won $1 and he was SO excited! it was mad funny!)

Ian? or Conor?: Why are we talking about Vinny n Christina when the f*cking Superbowl is on? (for some reason the whole room was in a deep convo on vinny cacioppo and christina anderson's relationship, lol)

LOL! it's sooo sad! newayz--then today jen n i were at the school folding programs and inserting the inserts in them(cuz wut else would u do with inserts but insert them? lol) and i'm sorry jen but i must share this with everyone who reads my blog(which is like me and the other jenn and mar and sometimes kev when he doesn't hate me): we were sitting on the risers in the band room and she was on a chair--her chair started slipping a lil off the riser and slowly she fell and she brought down 2 other chairs(one full of papers) and a recycling bin with her and she was just kinda on the chair that was half on one riser and half on the floor and then she slowly started to fall some more until she was down on the ground and i am so mean and i COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING! OMG! believe me, it was THE FUNNIEST thing i've ever seen! besides that extremely dorky girl, lol----then wut else---me manda n jenn were at mar's after---good times--let's c, steve came outta the closet, many times, LMAO! miggy was lost for a while---!CHOCOLATE! was eaten, and A LOT of it! we now know for real that mar is, or was in a past life, an african american nutritionist---jenn fell off the bed and bruised her knee---the video to My Band was watched at least 10 times--i don't remember wut else but in all today was a really funny day----o and before all this mar jenn n i went out to lunch n then to mandee where i bought jeans n a shirt---that's it, lol, like that info was really needed lol, but it made the end of the convo i guess---i'm leaving now b4 this entry gets any gayer---lata!

I was gonna change the template but i guess i just didn't feel like it lol--oh well, not like anyone looks at the blog but me newayz!  so sad i know---i feel like i need a guy---it's so annoying---seeing john n manda n their great relationship makes me very sad and i want someone! but someone who i like of course, and likes me back, duh! it's just so annoying to be without a guy--like it's sad cuz i don't even really like anyone---the one i do kinda like has a gf so that's outta the question no matter what---and the other one, i don't think i really want him, maybe just wanna use him, lol, but then again not really---well this weekend i think kenny is def coming up to hang out with jenn so he says he's bringing his friend---who is hopefully hot---or really nice---wuteva but i need a guy lol--and if i don't like him then i meet a new person and that's always good---i can't believe summer is so soon--it's crazy---summer will go by so quickly just like last summer---and then i'm a senior, holy crap, a senior---i graduate in a lil over a year! and 17 is coming soon--a month n 3 days until i can c rated r movies in the movie theater, or drive after 9, in jersey(or ne other state for that matter, penn here i come, lol, j/k, brandon is off limits i guess), with more than 2 people in the car--tho i never followed that law lol---this summer better be awesome---we better be allowed to drive the shore alone n stuff---gotta go back to point pleasant and see if ian, chris, n bob r hanging out on the boardwalk---chris wasn't all the hot but such a sweetie--and to think i wasn't gonna stop---or maybe that incredibly hot abercrombie model who worked at our hotel would b chillin on the boardwalk---that was a good trip---or maybe we can take a trip to wildwood like last yr---but maybe this time b allowed to stay out later---or have more freedom---or get guys lol--or jet ski again, that was awesome---well right now i'm goin to bed---it's early but i prob won't fall asleep til like 10---night night
