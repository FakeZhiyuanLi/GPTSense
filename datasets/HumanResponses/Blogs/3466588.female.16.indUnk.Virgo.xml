         today was my last day of my sophmore year!! & actually im kinda sad cuz everything is going 2 be different. days like these are what makes you sit back & think of how much everything changes. how much we are growing. we are never going 2 have this moment again & in one second it will just be a memory. in junior high, every day we heard the same quote, "the choices we make, shape our world tomorrow." & days like this is what makes you realize how much of an impact 1 choice can make. i have made many mistakes in my life but i dont regret them. alot of the time i wish i could change the choices i have made but w/o those mistakes i wouldnt be the person i am today.im a better person because of them. i learned. & thats all any1 can do.
