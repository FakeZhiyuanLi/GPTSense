      Yippee!!!!! I finally found a way to get my test photos onto a disc.  Turns out, w/ all of the photo editing programs I have, the one that works is actually Microsoft PowerPoint.  Still photos in a slideshow format should do nicely.    Now I just need to get the photos I need.  Also, my McNair Portfolio is due next week.  W/ graduate school information, and some other stuff.  I hadn't checked my schedule, so didn't realize it was already due until I received an email from the program director this morning.  So, I've got a lot to do this weekend.  Fortunately, I'm not too far behind.  Though I haven't actually applied...I take that back.  I did apply, online--which a lot of Universities are doing now--to University of Cincinnati.  However, I don't really count that, since I haven't sent the application fee.  Anyway, I have all of the information I need on several schools I'm interested in.  I just need to get all of the stuff together in one place.

      My baby, Tinee, german shepherd mix, has been diagnosed with heart failure.  I received this new on my brother's wedding day.  The wedding itself--before a judge--was not interrupted.  But, the picture session following the wedding was.  Some might say I should have expected it, since she is 14 years old, and larger dogs have shorter lifespans.  On the other hand, she never acted "old" until this past year.  She's taking medications, and she seems better; in fact, while at the vet's, she demonstrated her talents as an escape artist.  When we picked her up the next morning, the vet said that she learned how to open the doors, and spent the morning wandering through the rooms in the back.  Tinee's always been a very smart dog.    I had to leave the next morning, and come back to school.  I live on campus, because I have no vehicle.  Also because there is less distraction and annoyance; it's easier to concentrate on my studies.  I'm actually finished with my summer course; it was an online course--Profiling.  No lecture, no class discussion.  Read each chapter and take a test.  There were also some links to articles that further explored the subject matter for each chapter.    Though I am done with my summer course, I still have work to do this summer.  I am conducting an experiment/research project which deals with eyewitness testimony and how postevent suggestions effect witness memory.  I couldn't find a movie that seemed to suit my purposes, so I made my own.  Unfortunately, there were some problems lining up the "cast," which turned out to be very small; 3 persons, 3 dogs, and a couple of cats.  I still haven't got the test questions and photos set up yet.  I thought I had enough photos on my computer, but it turns out I don't.  That is, either I don't have the picture I want--for instance, a "look-alike" dog--or the picture I want to use is out of focus.  So, it looks like I will need to go home for a picture day.    So, to sum all this up, I have a lot to do.  And I feel guilty for not being able to spend more time with my baby--Tinee--when we might not have much time left.

      Now I've gone and done this (as opposed to thinking about doing it), would you believe I have nothing to say?  Not an easy accomplishment for someone who seems always to have   something   to say.  Of course, since anyone without opinions about something probably wouldn't even     think     of creating a blog.  I could be wrong about that.    It may be noticed that the title of this blog is a little off.  Apparently, the delete key or the delete finger (can't be sure which) was inoperable.  I was told that "What do I know?" couldn't be used, though no reason was given.  I obviously attempted to change it to "What do We know?", and failed.  And this is what I'm left with
