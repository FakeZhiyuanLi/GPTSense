      Yeah, that ultra-feminine, Britney-loving , turned even-more-sissy and God-worshipper. His nicknames? Seth, Ryan, Benji, or anything uncool. Hyuk hyuk.  Ok, when i first met him, he was annoying. Now, still annoying. Can i stand him? No. As in the two letters that come after 'm'.  When he entered Sec 3, his accent sorta changed. More American-ish, in a fake, phony way.And he has become an eurocentric! urgh! And to think he's Asian! a Chinese Asian with eyes so small and slit-ish that i have to strain my eyes to locate his iris. I'm not racist, i mean, i'm a Malay Asian, but GAWD yi hong! Get real!  And now, a year later, in our graduating year, he still has that noise coming out of his mouth. Accent, izzit? An accent all-right. A new accent no one has ever discovered before he made that one up. And he is so anti-British! I mean, c'mon dude! You're taking British English for 'O' levels! I would just love to stuff a scone up his skinny, yellow ass.  For past month, Yi Hong has been walking around with a holier-than-thou attitude. Reality check Yihong, religious Christians are supposed to be piou and humble, not arrogant and critical! It makes me so mad whenever he criticizes stuff that is not Christ-like to him, like music, love and blah. He usually picks on the stuff that i do, cause i think that he thinks that i'm 'contaminated' or something. And after he picks on me, we start arguing, i humiliate him,he faces the floor, and our friends around us just fidget in silence as i bask in triump of winning the argument, which is always.   Whenever yushaa or I start talking about 'Taboo' stuff,Yi hong would start saying"I read in the Bible that..." and whatever words that slobbers out of his mouth are just full of shit. As of i care what the Bible would say. I'm no Christian Yi hong! i ain't one! So stop preaching!&nbsp; Jeez!  &nbsp;

      U know, this situation is becoming something u only see in soap operas. YEs, u know wat i'm talkin about. The *drum rolls* Li/Fidah situation...  I have nothing agaisnt either of them. I like them both very , very much! But i if i were beaten up, strangled and forced to choose between the two, I'd choose Fidah, But only because my body is leaning only slightly to her. I'd be happy if abang chooses either one. Nice ladies, and wouldn't mind either one as sis-in-law. HOWEVER...  It's the way abang is playing with thier hearts, minds and bodies. I know abang has slept with both of them. Hell, i've accidentally seen him have sex with both of them( at different times of course, thank goddness). Too bad gouging my eyeballs out is painful....  Liana hates Fidah. Fidah dispises Liana. What a surprise. Not.They both bitch like old aunties who found out that the price of the fish in the market rose by $0.02. In other words, in my opinion, their endless bickerings are useless and stupid. Bitchy-itchy.  I cannot believe my abang ain't a virgin. I intend to stay one till marriage. Well, stumbling upon him having sex twice should make me ill enough to want to stay away from another male's penis, my cat included.  I can't believe i just said that.

      I have been burning the midnight oil, stayed in school for almost 12 hours per day, ate less than half my usual food intake, eye bags are forming, and i swear, there are voices telling me to scream and hit out on everyone!!  Seriously, i can't stand the pressure and the stress! i hate it! ok, fine, i'm all excited about the O's and the end of it, blah blah blah! But still, I'm 16! i dun wanna die young!!! I have lost 2 kg this week due to my lack of consumption of nutritions, and my i can't remember what Miss Tang taught me just yesterday!!!  I am taking 7 subjects(technically, 9, cause Science consists of Bio and Chem, While CH consists of Geo and SS) and my i've so far partly extinguished a flame. I'm taking MT LC tomorrow, i still have to do my Art coursework(which, even to my sis' standards, is pretty bad) and i still have...5 (technically 7) subjects!!! I can't take anymore math equations! i can't take anymore crap about the structure of fruits! or the natural environment! or the social and economic state of the world!  What i REALLY need is to relax!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I've already made plans with my amigos about what we're gonna do after the damn Os. We are gonna die our hair pink, drink alcohol(screw my age!), make a fake IC, and eat all the muffins in Famous Amous!!!  Only 144 days to freedom...

      Zack. A boy i like. A boy i like who likes me. And he wants to go out with me. But i keep rejecting him. Why? Is it cause i'm insecure? Is it cause my life is so ruined i cant stand happiness? Is it cause my distrust for men is so great i cant trust him? Or is it cause my O levels is near and i need to concentrate on that? Yup. Definitely that... I think.  I wonder if i should tell Cheryl that Zack still talks to me? If i do, she'll go all blah. Its been more than half a year, and Zack just won't give up! If i tell yushaa, she will be like "get him!". Ahh...Yushaa, someone i can count on :D
