         Today was such a long day.    Last night I tried to sleep early so that I would wake up at 5 o clock because we will be having a field trip at Museo Pambata.    And indeed I woke up soooo early, like  2:00 am ,    since I can’t sleep already I just surf the net till  5:00 . The trip to Museo Pambata was a little long, and the kids were pretty noisy asking me so many question and walking around the van, one keep on singing, that was really a fun ride though I find it tiring because the kids specially Tristan, Sema, and Awie was so kulit.                       Then off we went to Museo Pambata, it was not that nice compared to the museums abroad, but it is ok for me.    I had so much fun playing the basketball and having perfect scores ( of course its for kids), I’m, quite frustrated though cause I failed to climb up the wall, well it was not only me who was frustrated my co-teacher Salve also wanted to climb, but we can’t cause we were too afraid that we will destroy the wall because it was too small for us.    But I has so much fun we played bahay-bahayan and explored the wonders of our body, and the arts works of the children displayed in the museum was marvelous.    After our trip almost all of us ate ice cream.    I was shocked though that the manongs who sells nestle ice cream product was selling pinipig crunch of a much more cheaper brand, he made me laugh.                           Then Salve and I ate at Manang Cora’s house, wow    the food was really yummy, she cook ginataang kalabasa , wow I love it sooo much, it reminds me of home    though.                                The best part of my day though was when Salve and I ate (we always eat) at Taj Ma, wow it was so cozy there I love to sleep there.    Taj is a different kind of restaurant were we just squat on a big big pillow.    The food was yummy too, then later I asked the waiter is he could reheat my half shawarma, minutes later they apologize because it was gone, so they replace it, wow I even didn’t complain.                   And the coolest part was may manhuhula, wow Salve and I really wants to see a manhuhula, so cool talaga right. Well the manghuhula I guess answered all my worries in life which I will tell you later (just in case you are interested).    The thing I learned today is we should not always worry, because something good is really going to happened to us, sabi bga HAKUNA MATATA. Right?? Sige till here nalang kasi I’m just testing and I wanna take a bath na.
