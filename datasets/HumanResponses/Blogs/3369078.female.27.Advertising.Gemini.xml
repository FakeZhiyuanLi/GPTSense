      I was reading my Lonely Planet guidebook to Vietnam last night when I came across a section titled, "Pity the Unmarried". It read:   Telling the Vietnamese that you are single or divorced and enjoy a life without children may disturb them greatly. Not having a family is regarded as bad luck and such people are to be pitied, not envied. Many Vietnamese will ask if you are married and have children. If you are young and single, simply say you are 'not yet married' and that will usually be accepted. If you are not so young (over 30) and unmarried, it may just be better to lie.    I love Lonely Planet guides. And I thought it was difficult being single in San Francisco. Being half-Japanese I see some of this thinking in my own family. My grandmother and mother at my heels about every date I go on. Don't get me started on how apeshit they get if the guy is Asian. I find that most Asian cultures find many things to be bad luck though. My mother tells me it's bad luck to have my bed facing north and south and to not eat all my rice. She even told me that my lucky number 4...is bad luck because it is an even number. Maybe that explains why I haven't won the lottery with my "winning selection of numbers" 4-4-4-4-4 and mega number 4.  Oh well. Don't pity me, just pity the fool(s) that didn't marry me. haha. I had to throw in a "pity the fool" in honor of Mr.T.

      So I'm a year older today and so far, I don't feel any different. Except maybe a little more tired. I think that has more to do with drinking mojitos than being older though. I had a great evening with an amazing friend of mine, Kamal. Kamal is an observer and philosopher. Curious about the world and the people around him. He gives wonderful advice and makes you feel that anything is possible.  I'm so thankful to have him in my life.  Having birthdays are great reminders of the kick ass people in life. The friends and family that leave you with the warm and fuzzy feelings. Another incredible friend of mine, Reagan, has a tradition of always reading me my horoscope for the year on my birthday. This one sounds right on to me:  You have what it takes to make a difference this year.  You choose the right words.  Your creativity spins your mind on many adventures.  You want to travel and understand other styles of living.  If you are single, you will find others changeable and willing to talk about issues.  You do want someone who grows emotionally, don't you?  Just don't start a relationship until after June.  LEO brings you out of the doldrums. Today will be a Five Star Day.  I never imagined LEOnardo DiCaprio would bring me out of the doldrums though. Hey, at this point I'm open to anything. I also received some words of wisdom from someone who was once upon a time 27. He said, "Don't hold back or put things off. Just go for it." That's great advice but a tough one for me. I'm queen of procrastination and get comfortable and afraid of the unknown. Fuck it. It's time to shake things up. It's time to put down the Ensure smoothie and take some chances. What's in store for year 27? That remains to be seen...  It was definitely a Five Star Day. Thank you!

      My grandmother passed away last September leaving behind a family and a marriage of 60 years. She was quite a remarkable woman whom I learned quite a bit from. She married my grandfather at the age of 19 right before he left for the war. They raised five children together. Actually, I would say my grandmother did the majority of the raising while my grandfather worked. Needless to say, my grandmother, Dorothy learned the value of naps early on. I remember spending days at their house swimming in the pool with my cousins while my grandmother took naps. It's not difficult to understand why she napped so much after you meet my cousins.  This has been a difficult year for the family adjusting to life without her. Especially, for my grandfather. He still lives in the house where they raised the family and sees all the photos and memories every day. Her death and the days before her death brought the family together in such a way I never imagined possible. That side of my family has always been on the more conservative side and seldomly shows their emotions. So seeing my grandfather cry for the first time in my life was heartbreaking and something I'll never forget.   As the family goes through her belongings, we find these little mementos along the way. My grandfather found a note she had written to herself many years ago and placed in her bible. It was so touching and a nice reminder of their enduring legacy.  July 5, 1987  “Marriage-For My Children”  This is Forever Mind your manners Never stop courting, take time to get away from the kids Go to the beach and sit on a park bench together, it doesn’t cost a penny Manage money or money will manage you 10% goes to the church live on 80% or 90% Enjoy sex in the commitment and context of marriage Discover friends that you both enjoy Establish by-laws on your in-laws Never put down family and friends Find real and lasting happiness Make a decision to grow closer as the years go by Never let your children come before your mate Have some of the same interests Have a faith and nurture it   Reading this now, I can appreciate and agree with most of her "rules" aside from the 10% going to the church, but that's another topic. I'll interpret it as "give to others". Okay, and the enjoy sex in the context of marriage part may be a little challenging to follow. Why do you think everyone married when they turned 18 back then?   Marriage has changed so much since the time my grandparents were married. Both women and men are more focused on careers and improving themselves and less on committing to just one person. The idea of getting married usually doesn't occur until later in life after you've accomplished goals, travelled, dated many others, or discovered how to bring world peace (aka, never). Maybe this hesitation or lack of desire to get married can be attributed to the staggering divorce rates? We've become so pessimistic and afraid of love and commitment it seems. It kind of makes me sad. The idea that there is that one person out there who you are meant to experience life with can be so exciting. To be able to cultivate a relationship with someone into something even greater than you ever imagined.   Sure, there's the ugly side of marriage. The "maintenance" it requires and the ability to evolve with another person over time can be challenging I'm sure.  All my married friends always tell me to enjoy being single or often think about what their lives would have been like if they would have waited longer before getting married. I'm not necessarily in a rush to get married but a part of me is somewhat envious of the relationship my grandparents had. They were young, clueless, and scared- but in love. They managed to not only stay together but stay in love until the very end.   Of course marriage is not for everyone. Some choose to do other things with their life and find happiness in other ways. I don't think you need a marriage certificate to be happy in life. But I do think you need love. Everyone wants to be loved.  The world always seems to look a little bit different to someone in love. La vie en rose, right?   I'll always look to my grandparents as proof that love is powerful and that love can transcend time. Okay, insert sappy love songs...now.

      No, I'm not referring to a Whitney Houston song, but rather an art show I went to last night.   One of my friends, who I refer to as da Bigenho is an artist and curator of this great new exhibit mpps (http://www.rxgallery.com/mpps/). MPPS is an acronym for Mobile Phone Photo Show. This is one of the first of its kind and I have to say it was so intriguing.   The artists are comprised of people from all over the world. They could be you and me. The concept is to have people send in photos they've taken with their mobile phones. It has been a huge hit. He was telling me they've been receiving thousands from all over the world. So last night was the first night and it will continue until mid-June. I'm excited to see the complete exhibit. It is a huge undertaking though. It will probably take a month to cut out and paste all the images to the wall in the gallery. I did my part and pasted maybe 40 photos to the wall and I loved looking at all the different images.   Some make you laugh. Others are difficult to even distinguish what the subject is. The photos are the voice or brief glimpse into someone else's world. A homeless man sleeping on the street. A kiss. A dog driving a car. Graffiti on a building. Landmarks. Each one so unique and different than the next.   I'm amazed by the technology we have today. Mobile phones that take and send photos enables us to connect with people in such a new way. Information is instantaneous. It can be beautiful one second and tragic the next. I think I saw the beauty in most of the snapshots last night though.   Usually, people take photos of special events or people and those are the photos that go into picture frames. The ease of mobile phone photos allows users to capture subjects they most likely wouldn't have thought worthy of a photograph. A cloud in the sky. A fence. A light fixture. It made me look at things differently. While a light fixture doesn't seem all that beautiful, the fact that someone thought it was interesting enough to take a picture of and send, made it beautiful to me. I guess I just try to think of what that person was thinking and let my imagination take flight. That's what art is about to me. Generating emotions.  I guess it was a nice reminder to take notice of the little things that we often overlook. And as a wise friend once told me, it's better to be looked over, than over looked.

      It seems so trivial to sit here and write about the trials and tribulations (more tribulations than trials, lately) of the relationships in my life. Someone told me to ask myself whether my problems are worthy of my life. When compared to the bigger picture, I'd have to say no. I'm not living in the ravages of war, or inflicted with some terminal illness. Indeed, it could always be worse. Some may choose to tackle the bigger issues. Some may fight the fight in their own small way. As Maude (of the film, Harold and Maude) would say, she's walked the picket lines and the protests back in the day, now she still fights the same issues, just in her own small way.   The thing is, our issues are our own. While in comparison to others they quickly can become small and insignificant but they still exist. I wonder if I'll ever meet that special person who wants the same things I do while living in this intensly self-driven and career-minded community of San Francisco. I've witnessed this strange phenomenon known as "the couple", so I know it's possible.   It's definitely not the end of the world being single, and having your heart broken time after time. I would like to experience not being single before the end of the world though. So get back into the picket lines of dating right? Maybe I just need a new sign or phrase to shout.

      So here I go again. Cursed by bad timing. If I had a dollar everytime I heard "You are such an incredible person, it's just that I'm not capable of giving you what you deserve/committing" I'd have...a lot. Okay, so maybe not enough to buy a private jet, but at least a few rum and cokes on a private jet. And maybe some honey roasted peanuts. Hey those aren't cheap.  I take chances with my heart because it's difficult to get to know people if you they can't get to know you right? I swear though, the investment is killing me. Just when I felt fine being on my own I meet a guy like Dan.  He seemed so different and we connected from the start. He just isn't sure if he wants to be in a serious relationship after the last one he was in. He said all the right things, "you're great...I'm an asshole...it's not fair to you...any guy with their head screwed on right would scoop you up in a heartbeat."  But alas, he's not in that place in his life. Maybe if we had met later? He said he did feel like he was making a big mistake but he just had to go with what he thinks he's capable of for now.   For now, I am sad. I want to drink Mojitos and scream at the world. I'll have to bust out the Radiohead and visit my melancholic boyfriend Thom Yorke.  Just when I think my life has reached it saddest moment, I just listen to Thom and know I'm okay.

      I was having drinks with some friends the other night at this bar in North Beach. I was with other singles and it was kind of amusing watching everyone watch each other. Always looking for that certain someone to walk through the door. I don't know how you know who that person will be. I saw many attractive men walk by, but never really felt compelled to initiate conversation with any of them. (I guess they felt the same way about me too. Maybe it's because I wasn't wearing my see-through, ultra low-cut, half shirt, halter top, like all the other women there.) I find myself looking for that special someone but it often feels like that special someone isn't looking for me.  I've met many guys and even managed to date some of them, and the one common thing I realized is that we never want the same things. When my friend Kamal and his girlfriend broke up, primarily because they both wanted different things in life and from each other, it made me really think about what people want in relationships. I look at my married friends and see how they initially wanted different things- like one wanting to live near the ocean, the other wanting to live in Colorado. One wanting to start a family right away and the other wanting to wait much longer or maybe never wanting children. They've somehow managed to compromise or one of them sacrificed what they wanted in order to be together. Does this cause resentment? I'm not sure and I would like to think it doesn't.   Some of our wants are bigger than others and can't really be overlooked or sacrificed I guess. The whole "I want children." and "I don't want children" is a big issue for example. We all have these ideas of what we want our lives to be like and things we want to do or ways of living, but there are people who gave up a little of those "wants" for something worth more to them. Sometimes finding true love is worth enough to put aside some of the wants and other times love just isn't enough and the dreams are bigger. I hope to find someone who wants the same things as I do or at least think I'm worth finding the compromise of what we both want in order to have each other.   I saw this elderly couple walking down the street yesterday (very slowly, I might add) and they were holding hands. It was so cute. Their bodies, so old and frail, but the little signs of affection still very much alive. I want that.

      Recently, I became an Auntie for the first time. My nephew, Jack entered the world a hefty 9lbs 5 ounces. Every parent says their child is the most beautiful in the world and I'd have to agree that this kid is pretty damn adorable. There's something about holding this new life in your arms that renews your whole perspective in life.   What I've really been touched by is the change in my brother. Mark has always been the best older brother I ever could have asked for. In many ways he also has taken on a fatherly role in my life. He's always there whenever I need him. He inspires me in many ways. Now, he has this beaming, proud father look about him. You know how people say that pregnant women have that special "glow" sometimes? Well, my brother has that glow from becoming a father. Every moment of Jack's day is treasured. Even the dreaded diaper changing.   Mark has had some incredible achievements throughout his life, and the family is so proud of him. I know that Jack is the one "achievement" that has brought him the most satisfaction though. Life now takes on a different direction in regard to priorities and what truly matters in life.   I just look forward to loading this kid up on tons of sugar then dropping him off with his parents at the end of the day.

      I shouldn't have done it, but I did. For some reason, there was some serious gravitational pull to the email folder archive today. Call me a masochist. We all have these folders in our email accounts. Or at least I do. Maybe normal people delete them after a while. I guess I hold on to them for the nostalgia. Or in Dan's case, to analyze every word and try to figure out what went wrong.   I know, I know. It really wasn't about me. He just wasn't ready for any kind of relationship. As much as I would like to believe that, the truth was he just wasn't ready for a relationship...with me. How did it go from,  "I had a great time yet again with you yesterday.  While we have been to some pretty decent places on our dates so far, something tells me it's you and not what we actually do or where we go that makes our time together so worthwhile!" to " I sincerely hope we can continue on as friends...I'm just truly unsure of what I want for myself"?  Since he "sincerely" managed to stop being friends with me, I should write him off as an asshole. For leading me on and being a coward and not really telling me the truth about not wanting to continue into a relationship. If it was just a matter of him not being ready, I  could respect that. I just know that wasn't the real reason. I'll get over him. My heart still feels like it's in a million pieces still. I'm so tired of putting all the pieces back together though. I just feel like sweeping them under the rug.   I know I shouldn't be wasting any heartache over him. I know I need to move on. I know I'm worth more than he'll ever know and that I deserve better. Seriously, Lindsay. Get over it. This is just how I'm feeling and I can't do anything about it except write into oblivion. How can I channel this depression into some brilliant idea that will reap me millions of dollars and the ability to go up to Dan and say "neener. neener. neener"?  hmmmm... I already feel a little better.

      Wishes. We all have them. From the moment we're born we fill our lives with wishes. I wish I could tell the lady with the milk that I'm hungry. I wish that I could reach that plate of cookies on top of the refrigerator. I wish that I would get picked first for the kickball team. As we get older the wishes become significantly larger. I wish they would give me that 50% raise. I wish that I had the winning lotto numbers. I wish I looked like Halle Barry. Most of the time, these wishes remain just that. We continue to hold onto them for one simple reason though...hope.   Sometimes wishes do come true. For instance, the couple that won the lottery TWICE in the same day with combined winnings of over 5 million dollars. Of course they had been playing the lottery (both quick picks and scratch tickets) every day for 20 years. The odds of that happening were something like 1 in 5 trillion. Wishes can be frivolous. They can also be a desperate plea. I wish the drunk walked home rather than drive his car through that red light. I wish he didn't have cancer. Or as my dear friend struggles to become pregnant, I wish I could become a mother. I wish I could grant her her wish.  Anything is possible in this life. While many of our wishes in life may never come true we must never give up hope. For our lives are already better for the moments we realize what we already have and to not take it for granted.

      A great friend of mine recently emailed me an article from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The article is about how an act of conscience, like that of Army specialist Joseph Darby in Iraq, can truly change the world. Abu Ghraib was a sad statement on humanity. It frightens me how can people treat each other with such disregard. But people are also capable of touching the world around them in such profound ways and it's important to remind ourselves of that from time to time.  PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE Weekend Perspectives: "An army of one: As Spc. Darby showed, an act of conscience can change the world"  Saturday, May 22, 2004  By Bill Shore   Army Spc. Joseph Darby's decision to report the abuses at Abu Ghraib to  his commanding officer powerfully affirms what playwright Arthur Miller  meant when he wrote that "as improbable as it may seem, sometimes an  individual conscience is all that keeps a world from falling."  If there is anything positive to be salvaged from the shattering disillusionment that is Abu Ghraib, it is that the next generation of leaders will learn that individual acts of conscience can ultimately  prevail over systematic abuse, repression, discrimination and entrenched power structures even those as seemingly impenetrable as the Defense  Department's.  By sounding the alarm, Darby triggered an avalanche of consequences including: congressional hearings, presidential statements, far-reaching changes in U.S. policy toward the interrogation of detainees, widespread political ramifications reaching from the Arab world to Prime Minister Tony Blair's re-election prospects, and possibly a decisive shift in public opinion about the war.  Darby's actions embody one of history's most unassailable lessons: Individual acts of conscience often create more sweeping change than  the official acts of large institutions. There are moments when those with  the least power, wealth, privilege or rank, those who may be feeling more  alone than they've ever felt in their lifetime, can have a greater impact  than could possibly be imagined.  History is replete with examples ranging from the legacies of icons  like Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., to other actions large and small:  When Herbert Carter refused to obey Lt. William Calley's order to shoot defenseless Vietnamese villagers at My Lai, he prevented additional carnage,  and his subsequent testimony about the atrocities led to the conviction  of Calley and widespread reform.  When in 1942, Jan Karski, a 28-year-old diplomat for the Polish  government in exile, crawled through a tunnel into the Warsaw Ghetto to see for  himself the plight of hungry and dying Jews, and then crossed the Atlantic to  inform President Franklin Roosevelt, it was a first step toward ending the Holocaust.  When Pee Wee Reese, disgusted by the vulgarity of racist baseball fans, walked over to second base to comfort Jackie Robinson with a hand on  his shoulder, Robinson's transition into the major leagues was  substantially eased by that solitary and gentle act.  When Oseola McCarty, a washerwoman from Mississippi, donated $150,000  of her hard-earned savings for a scholarship fund at the university, Ted  Turner was inspired to pledge $1 billion to the United Nations, saying, "If that  little woman can give away everything she has, then I can give a billion."  We tend to think that creating change requires an array of external resources and support: acts of Congress, great sums of money, large  standing armies, technology, vast research capabilities, or powerful lobbyists, relationships, and networks. Of course, all have their place. But often  the most sweeping change results from a single individual with none of  those at his or her command, but instead with the courage to follow his or her conscience.  That acts of conscience have power is not a new idea. But because  abiding one's conscience often puts friendships, popularity, career and  possibly even one's liberty at risk, each generation must discover anew the  faith that acting upon conscience requires. It is the faith upon which all  social change is conceived, the bedrock of every effort to serve country and community. It is what keeps a soldier in his platoon and a Peace Corps volunteer in her village when the odds of success or even survival seem slim. It is the impulse that holds the doctor to the O.R. and the  teacher to the classroom. It is the essence of the American character.  Years from now, Joseph Darby may only be a footnote in the telling of  even greater events that have yet to unfold. But he has forever reshaped the history of our time and not one of us has been left untouched by his  act of conscience.

      I must say that being a successful writer, actor and director, Zach tends to forget certain things from time to time. Like leaving the love of his life (ME) in San Francisco. What do you expect for a guy flying city-to-city and promoting his upcoming film? I'll be here waiting for you Zach-and I mean that in the most non-stalker like way possible.   Can I just say that the man is pure genius? Not only through the hilarity of the TV show, Scrubs, but now through his directorial debut in the film, Garden State. I cannot wait to see this movie. This is the only movie I have watched the trailers more than once. Okay, so maybe 23 times...in the last 5 minutes. It's incredibly moving though. As well as the soundtrack. Excellent. Travis' song "Love Will Come Through" is a must have.   I don't know if I fell in love with the character he plays on Scrubs first or as the man behind the movie. Comedy wins my heart over. It's not as though he has the sex appeal of Brad Pit say, but he's sexy in a genuine, "I will sex you wild, and write a limerick after" kind of way. Does that even make sense? Well, at least it rhymes.   Or maybe it's the internal struggle of a man trying to become an actor and survive in Hollywood and running into all these diversions and life events along the way that makes him so attractive. Maybe it's both.   He absolutely has my attention. Oddly, in an almost pre-teen super-fan sort of way. Like if he were walking through a mall, I would be the girl shoving all the weeping teeny boppers out of the way just to touch an empty water bottle he threw away or brush up against his luggage at an airport or something. If he ever were to read this I'm sure he'd run screaming in the other direction. So again, I mean this in a most non-stalker like way.   I think he's the type of guy that most probably wouldn't notice right away if he walked into a room. He would be the guy drinking a Yoo-hoo in the corner while watching people and looking mysterious and  intriguing. Of course until he started doing some crazy naked dance to make everyone laugh. (this dance had a particular name on a Scrubs episode, which I can't remember right now).  Anyway, I look forward to the movie's release and to see what other remarkable things he creates. Until then, I remain Miss Heensay, instead of Mrs. Braff.

      I'm a little concerned with it's whereabouts. I might have to post flyers, saying "where is the love?".   Seriously, what happened to courtship? Am I being too traditional and old fashioned for wanting to be wooed? Everything today seems to happen so fast. We want everything right now and if it doesn't happen instantaneously, we lose interest. Speed dating, internet dating...if there isn't an instant love connection, we move right ahead to the next. I know that love can't always be like the cover of some cheesy romance novel,  nor do I want it to be. The last guy I want sweeping me off my feet is Fabio. I also understand that men's brains don't function quite the same way as women's.   Serenading a woman or writing love letters are things that men generally just don't think about. I'm not saying that they don't happen. There are definitely men out there that are incredibly romantic and have very creative ways of showing it.   Take for example my favorite poet, Pablo Neruda. Here's a man who wrote incredible poems of love. Pablo was the man. He must have had women wrapped around his fingers with the words he wrote for them.    Sonnet LXXXI   And now you're mine. Rest with your dream in my dream. Love and pain and work should all sleep, now. The night turns on its invisible wheels, and you are pure beside me as a sleeping amber.  No one else, Love, will sleep in my dreams. You will go, we will go together, over the waters of time. No one else will travel through the shadows with me, only you, evergreen, ever sun, ever moon.  Your hands have already opened their delicate fists and let their soft drifting signs drop away; your eyes closed like two gray wings, and I move  after, following the folding water you carry, that carries me away. The night, the world, the wind spin out their destiny. Without you, I am your dream, only that, and that is all.   Pablo Neruda   Flowers are good too. Even a post it note saying "thinking of you". It doesn't take much. Just to know that you are thought of and cared for. If men only knew what romance does for women and I guess...in turn for them!

      I heard this song today on the radio and I remembered how much I loved it. In my head I've said this to others so many times it seems. The broken hearts. I've always been rather reserved and tend to withold a lot about myself until I feel that I can trust that the person. When I realized a while back that by witholding who I really am, I'm not giving the other person the opportunity to see who I really am. It's a risk one has to take in order to gain something greater in the end.   Still, there are others that may never see the real me and inside I think, "Damn, they are missing out".  We've all been in the situation where we don't want to be the friend and instead be the lover. Or you think they are walking away because they THINK they know the real you when in fact, they don't have the slightest clue.  It still doesn't ease the pain of rejection though.   There's so much feeling behind this song and only Ray Charles can sing it. The live version is the best though.   You Don't Know Me Ray Charles   You give your hand to me And then you say hello I can hardly speak My heart is beating so And anyone can tell You think you know me well But you don't know me  Oh you don't know the one That thinks of you at night Who longs to kiss your lips And yearns to squeeze you tight No I'm just a friend That's all I've ever been You just don't know me  I never knew the art of making love Though my heart aches with love for you Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by The chance that you might love me too  You give your hand to me And then you say goodbye I watch you walk away Beside the lucky guy You'll never, never know The one who loves you so You just don't know me  I never knew the art of making love Though my heart aches with love for you Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by The chance that you might love me too  You give your hand to me And then you say goodbye I watch you walk away Beside the lucky guy Who'll never, never know The one who loves you so You just don't know me  You'll never, ever know mmmm, cause you just don't know me
