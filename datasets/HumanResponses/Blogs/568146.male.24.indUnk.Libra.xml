      having my lunch as usual...been intrigued by this gurl named fujiko fujio. still dunno if thats her real name or what. well, i saw all the wonders she showed on her website, and its more than a year now since ive started finding out how this gurl looks like. shes a filipino, i know...by the way she speaks her mind, and of crs, some pics mainly focuses on filipina actresses on her website though asians take most of her sites space. anyway, i like her site... not only bcoz of the good "stuffs" i download from her website. i think its getting into my senses that i like asians more than caucasians. my cds proves it well. ok gotta use d little time i have b4 my boss comes back

      ola! im back after getting pissed off from this stupid blogger that erased my post last friday...its sunday, and damn, gotta go to work tom again. i miss my college days, where i could stay  in bed as late as i wanted. d only good thing that compromises this situation is that i have my own money and i can buy things as i want as long as my budget allows me...:) we went to sm this afternoon, watched hidalgo, that burned my ass on the seat, i almost slept there, dunno if i just lacked sleep or the movie was too boring to watch. didnt like it that much. d girl i was expecting 2 be d leading lady for viggo turned up as one of d villain, and i was even expecting a dirty scene with them...*sigh* hidalgo was the name of the horse, its not a spoiler ok, but hu cares, i wudnt recommend it anyway. nuthin much happened 2day. except that im starting to build a webpage, which i hope ill be able to finish, im using html-kit(i got from fujiko, ur webpage rocks, lots of stuffs!) and frontpage, very usefiul, especially for those hu dont know how html works like me. ok, gotta sleep early...

      met up in the ofc at 8, we should be leaving at 9 but someone got excited and we left early arnd 8:30, and as usual ida was late again, on the bus spent 3 hours to malolos for the inauguration of the flyover, the flyover is nice, i just wished i became part of it at least. aside from the good stuffs it would contribute to my financial status...:P, its a good experience, up in malolos we went, walked over the wonder flyover, its far better than the one we built in san fernando, well, for a permanent one, it should be. talked to the lads i missed for months, some since xmas. then paul diamond came, the british ambassador, he is nice, very approachable indeed, plus some politicians, etc. then finally, off to white rock beach resort. the place is very nice, spending most of the times with emcie, bea, ida, r3, peter, and sometimes with ben, the new expat of the eng'g dept. hes still adjusting to us, obviously, he looked bored...

      i reserve the word "hate" for very few people in this world, but I really truly hate bus and jeepney drivers, and i hate them with a passion, they are totally inconsiderate with their selfish crave for money, they never consider people who are in hurry, hurry to go home, hurry to sleep...i can deal with a regular traffic jam (that's what manila is known for), people pushing their way onto the bus or a stupid traffic enforcer whistling just for us to know they exist, once in a while, but spending half an hour on a bus at an intersection just to get more people on is way too much.

      woke up at 6, yeah its early, r3 who woke me up, was still darn sleepy...got ready for a swim again, went to the beach and found the 2 hobbits in the beach waiting for d sun. man, they really wanted to get tan. but i doubt their color changed a bit...hehe. the outing was ok, but wasn't as fun as i expected. went home, the bus dropped us at sm city, me and bea, also james tan, and the other guy, i forgot his name, i let bea get on an fx first, it was raining hard. hope she had a safe journey home. i like bea coz she used to smile always, used to, coz i noticed in d past weeks, there's something different on her...or maybe it was just me. whatever. manny pacquiao got a draw on his fight, i heard he broke his forearm? now that's bad.. tsk tsk. i slept very early, i was home by 4 and i was dead tired, it was a long travel, i slept around 4:30, woke up at 10 pm, eat some food, then i watched again "my sassy girl" and it touched my heart again...sigh. i really love d movie.

      as usual, i nvr bothered posting new one until now... i played badminton last night, again... more like a training then after, i play with those new friends everytime i go there. i was surprised to see how many pinoys are now indulged in badminton these days, back when i was playing tennis, and i was playing some badminton as well, only few badminton courts available in our area. and mostly are private ones, so u could only play by invitation but now, u can find it anywhere... its a nice sport, aside from the gehls u see everytime, i find it more challenging than tennis, or maybe i just didnt put too much time in tennis than im spending on badminton now. i already had 4 sessions of training, and every morning after those trainings is hell, i cud hardly get up.i rememebr the time when we played gotcha, then after, my legs damn hurt for a week. il have another one tom. badminton rules! hehe.
