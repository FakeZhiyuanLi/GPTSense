      Well, in my head I am. I made a minor change to the template that gives all of Stoney's posts a pink title and mine a blue one, so you know which ones will be funny (blue) and which ones will be messed up and uncomprehensible (pink). We're working on getting Stoney an Audiomatch.net image but her computer crashes every time she moves her mouse more than one pixel. Stay tuned.

      I swear if I have to correct one more person on the proper usage of "you're" and "your" I'm going to do absolutely nothing about it but whine and bitch on this page. Don't push me.

      Waking up in my house is no thrill either. After going to bed at 2 am, the first thing you hear is my dad destroying the house about three hours later. Then at 6:15 my alarm goes off and I slam that Snooze button bitch. Normally, these 10 minutes of silence are vital for a good start to any day. This explains why I rarely have a good day. If you were to sleep at my house, in these 9 minutes of “peace” you would hear muffled yelling from the living room, the more you try to rest, the louder it gets. Ignoring this monster just makes it angrier; eventually it’ll even get enraged enough to actually get out of bed to harass you in yours. She’ll come charging into the room, and swing the door open hard enough to kill a weak man. When you open your eyes the lights are already on and the monster will be yelling in an uncivilized manner “DON’T BE LATE GET TO SCHOOL ARG!! ERR!!”. All you can do is pray she doesn’t rip the wall down and keep trying to sleep. When she sees you ignoring her , she’ll go back to bed until the snooze alarm goes off. Repeat this procedure about twenty times. When she comes so far as to ripping your blanket off, threaten to punch her head off . This will usually stun it for about 45 seconds while it tries to figure out if you're serious or not. This is a good chance for you to run to the shower. Don’t forget to slam the door; it makes the veins bulge in her forehead. If you spend any more than 10 minutes in the shower, expect to hear the door being attacked with a jack hammer and about 30 rhinos.  On your way out the door, it will usually say something “encouraging” like have a good day. This is your opportunity to get partial revenge by telling her to burn in hell . This will ruin about ¾ of her day.

      I want to move out of my house, and I want to move out right fucking now. If someone would like to be my roommate as I can't make rent by myself drop me a line at the usual place. I don't eat much and I keep to myself most of the time. You might have heard some stories about me, but I swear they aren't true. Besides, it was consensual.  In case you haven't noticed, Steam sucks a large amount of donkey testicles.

      Warning: Long rant post containing small amounts of "the funny".  I'm starting to think the only reason I hate going to school is because I have to hear my mom wake me up for it. If I lived on my own or possibly with some kind of robot maid to wake me up I would probably jump out of bed every day happy to learn something new and expand my intellect or whatever they tell you school does. You're probably thinking I'm exaggerating. Let me explain how my mom goes about waking me up. 6:30am every day. She opens the door to my room which in itself is loud enough to just wake me up. The following sentence is the one main dreaded point if my morning: "Jake wake up- HELLO!?!?". Everything starts off normal... a nice friendly message telling me to get up. Followed  immediately  by screaming "HELLLOOOO!?!??!??" as if a) I didn't hear her in the first place b) I need to respond right away c) I've been ignoring her for twenty minutes already. I should mention that the "hello" is said at volume levels which are about equal to a 747 jet flying directly into one ear, through your brain and out the other. Total time elapsed: 3 seconds. As soon as I turn my head to investigate the source of stupidity, I'm blinded as she turns the lights on in sync with my eyes opening. Every morning I scream at her not to do that and wake me up in a more comfortable and polite manner, such as dropping an anvil on my head or setting my blanket on fire. She takes my blanket off me and throws it on the floor forcing me to seek out other sources of heat. I stumble blindly and hazily to the shower where she will proceed to yell at me through a closed door that she has to get in there and brush her teeth. Not once has she ever brushed her teeth before waking me up, even though she is practically late every single day because of this.  Anyone willing to trade moms can reach me at 1-800-4-GAY-MOM and leaving a brief message listing your name, age and why in the hell you would want to do this to yourself.

      There you have it folks. In a stunning battle, the Internet has emerged victorious over the English language. Want proof? Yahoo! Chat. TeenChat. MSN Chat. MSN Messenger. I dare you to talk to at least three people on any one of these services and have all of them use proper English. It's just not possible. Now some of you may be saying "wut r u talking abt? lol" or "u'r crazy!!1". If that's the case, then please jump off a cliff into a vat of acid that has spikes on the bottom which are on fire and also possibly sharp. When people first start using the internet, they should undergo weekly sessions with a doctor to ensure they don't start using abbreviations every second word. Some people say it's to save time, but how much time can be saved from cutting out one or two letters and replacing them with a NUMBER or something even further away from the original keys? Good thing you're saving time while I have to bust out my handy-dandy "Idiot Redneck to English" translator everytime your MSN window flashes. Idiots.  When asked about his victory, the internet was quoted as saying "fuk u, fgt".

       Think about it . Clam chowder (basically any chowder, I guess) is a mystery. People never ask what's in it, but when you get it you can't really tell because everything is covered by the thick white sauce (I assume this makes up the "chowder"). There could be hunks of plastic or phlegm or anthrax for all you know, and everything would taste the same due to the sauce. I asked a few people on MSN to see what they thought was in clam chowder. Observe.  streak [ pert ] says:     what's in clam chowder? sans everything - allchris.blogspot.com says:     clams? streak [ pert ] says:     hmm  streak [ pert ] says:     what's in clam chowder? .loves printer for not dying on me. says:     lobster, clam, and other fishes  streak [ pert ] says:     what's in clam chowder? kayyyla says:     clams  As you can see, three out of three people all thought (nay, ASSUMED) clam chowder contained clams. Therefore with some extrapolating we can say that 100% of the Earth's population would eat clam chowder assuming it was actually clams, potatoes and whatever Campbell says they put in there. I suspect that every bowl of chowder is a potential biological weapon manufactured primarily for high-risk guerilla warfare against your stomach. We might not be able to save everyone from this deadly game of Russian roulette, but for your sake, next time someone serves you clam chowder, ask "WHAT'S IN THIS?" and make a huge scene. Your kids will thank me later.

      I changed the site's template to use blue which I find is easier on the eyes. I was thinking about having a black background but I decided against it. Also, directly under the main title, you can check out which song I'm currently listening to in WinAmp. By the way, this page looks best in 1024*768 or higher, as lower resolutions don't like that hilarious comic I put down there.

      Ugh. My head feels like a chainsaw is ripping through sheet metal right next to me 24/7. Luckily I get to take tons of Tylenol and sleep it off in this big, warm, soft, inviting, small, hard, lumpy bed of mine. I almost jumped out of bed and murdered my brother because while he was leaving he decided to make more noise than Hiroshima and Nagasaki (just about as much damage to the house, too) because he couldn't find his belt. Fortunately for him he was more than two metres away which saved his life. It may be boring around here but at least  urlLink fat people  are still around to entertain me.

      There are some things in life that are so sad you just can't bring yourself to laugh at them, or else your friends will think you're a really big asshole. Like those commercials of the really poor slums in Bosnia and Turkey and whatnot of those poor starving kids, or the footage of people jumping out windows on September 11th. And then there's  urlLink THIS .

      So there's this annoying, boring girl that keeps talking to my friend Stoney on MSN so one day we decided to invite her to a Pizza Soccer tournament. Anyone wishing to contact this Liane girl can do so at  watermelon_1987@hotmail.com  and don't forget to mention Pizza Soccer hosted by Mix96. Just, if she asks, me or Jess never put you up to this.

      Alright, there seems to be a lot of confusion lately, so I'm gonna tell you which ninja turtle was the best once and for all.   Donatello.   First off he's fucking  SMART  which is a lot more than you can say about the other dumbfucks in his team. While they were off partying and wasting their time doing whatever he was building stuff that could fucking kick Shredder's ASS. He also kicks a ton of Foot Clan ass with that long stick (commonly called a Bo) while Leonardo has two swords and he never CUTS anyone. What the fuck? Use your goddamn sword properly, you stupid wuss. Donatello has a piece of wood but he could still probably whoop Leo or possibly shoot him with a pizza-powered catapult or some shit. I'm tired of him getting a bad rap just because he's the PURPLE one. "HA HA PURPLE IS THE GAY COLOR!" You wouldn't be saying that shit if good ol' Don kicked your ass all over the street like the badass that he is. On a second note, Mikey is awesome because of his weapon and Raphael I always liked in the videogames (I just chose him because he was red). Leonardo always got hogged by someone else, but you know what? I didn't CARE because Leo is an overrated piece of crap there I said it.   Oh and last night I was thinking about the forest fires in the US and I was wondering (hoping maybe) if it was possible for the entire country to burn down.

      Ok first, I go on the top bunk to escape the groping assholes and their scandalous nails that pinch you until you they can't pinch no more. Then someone starts heffing me so in an attempt to defend myself i start hanging over the guard rail. Next thing i know someone is pushing me and the other guy is pulling me forward and my legs went up in the ceiling to the point where i thought i would end my life of doom with a nasty 8 foot fall head first into lindz tv. Luckily i was saved at the last minute by lindsay C, maybe next time i won't be so lucky. Also , when we were walking home, i noticed my friends kicking around some rotten cushion. I decided to pick it up to shoot it at someone. As i bent down i felt this raunchy mist enter my eyes and a ratty sogged pillow hit me in the face. (someone kicked it on me)  i screeched and then exclaimed IT SPRAYED ME WITH DISEASE! when my eyes were able to SEE again all i saw was my friends all in the crouching (i cant take it im gonna piss my pants ) position and laughing like hell. I just laughed it off wishing i coulda seen that from another angle in some other form or something. Also, I hate poutine.

      Listen I know I haven't had a really good post on here in a while. I'm quite aware, so bear with me for a few days. In the meantime, you can check out my WinAmp playlist  urlLink here . You might like some of the stuff on it, or at least give it a try. You can see I like a lot of different types of stuff, but not everything in each category. Nobody better tell me rap is shit or whatever because I believe that you can't generalize music into sucky or not sucky. What I mean is, you can't say all rap sucks or all techno is good. To me it really depends on the artist, and even some artists can have good songs or bad songs. I really can't stand when people say ALL of a certain genre sucks, without listening to some of the better artists out there. But that's just me.

      Hi everyone. My name is Jacob and I have an addiction.  This isn't easy for me to say. Almost every morning... I put my clothes in the drier for 5-7 minutes before leaving my house. This makes them toasty warm for just about the length of time it takes me to get to the metro near my house. It uses electricity but I can't help myself. The thing is, while everyone is walking around freezing, I have my own little atmosphere inside my sweater making me perfectly comfortable and warm. Everyone is stupid but me.

      A whole bunch of scienticians and other smart people have been saying breakfast is the most important meal of the day for quite some time now. Usually I'm in a rush so I don't bother, but today I decided I might make some scrumalicious Belgian waffles.  What's that you say? They won't fit in the toaster? Yes. That's right. THEY DON'T FIT IN THE TOASTER. Belgian waffles are the square ones that are really thick and puffy, but this company decided to make them  extra  thick and fluffy. Thicker than the slots in my toaster. So I ended up having just a regular apple for breakfast. I might pass out today, but at least I can sue when I slam my head on a desk or something.

      I've said it before and I'll say it again. The two single best inventions ever are "food" and "sleep".  It all started with food being invented sometime in the year 1 million BC when a caveman thought to himself "Maybe if I put something in my mouth and chew on it, my stomach won't hurt so much." Well, it worked. Soon came ideas such as: - Killing your food before you eat it. - Cooking your food before you eat it. - Killing your food before you cook it. - A&W hamburgers Since then food has evolved into the greatest invention of all time. If you don't believe me then how about you don't eat for a few days then tell me how great food is.  Sleep was invented some time in the 14th Century in France. Someone came up with the crazy idea of "I wonder if we closed our eyes for hours at a time we wouldn't be so goddamn tired all the time." Of course it was France so it probably sounded like "le time" or something. Soon came beds and blankets, and eventually those little trays you can have bed and breakfast with. The great thing about these two inventions is that if you're hungry and there's no food around, just go to sleep for a couple hours. When you wake up the chances are somebody has either done groceries or cooked a meal in your house.  Cannibalism and bedbugs both originated in Australia. Fuck them.

      Bah. It turns out that the bus drivers aren't on strike; it's the maintenance workers. So basically as soon as those asshole drivers shut up, the mechanics decide to take a shit fit? Why didn't they fucking say something while the drivers were at it? Everything I said about this strike being gay still stands, just place the blame somewhere else now. I'm wondering if maintenance workers are harder to replace than bus drivers, or easier; if they were harder the STM would listen to them and I could take the bus home again. If they're easily replaceable maybe this strike could last a bit longer than expected. Either way, STM is kinda stupid for not running enough buses when the students need them. They should take the risk a bus breaking down and help us out. But that's just my opinion.   STM: 1, My feet: 0  P.S. Hot damn, Stoney. Learn to type!

      Every weekend starting now I will post one long post containing a bunch of comments from people who read this blog. The way it's going to work is: You  urlLink e-mail me  with the subject of your e-mail as "blog comment", and the e-mail containing your comments. If your subject is NOT "Blog comment", I may decide not to show it on the site. You've been warned. Example: If you wanted to comment on something, you would put your e-mail's subject to "Blog comment" and then say something like "Good idea, dipshit" in your e-mail. You can leave your name and e-mail if you wish, or you can ask not to have them shown. Then at the end of the week I compile your comments (leaving out the pointless or stupid ones) and post them in a blog on this page.  Simple? E-mail your comments to  urlLink streak@playcs.com .

      First I just sit on the steps playing guitar in Lindz basement but then those dykes won't stop yelling LINNNNNDZZZ put on a cd!!! So she makes me get out of her "Dj Seat" which in actual fact is cold hard bad stairs and makes me go indulge in the bunk bed with those smelly assholes. I had to cram right in the middle while they always fucken Blasted (farted) and laughed when they were "rotten". Everyones breath stank like cheese and it was about 400 degrees in there. Not to mention the fact that lindz's piss room was malfunctioning and the stench was more raunchy than ever. We had to listen to bad Tool Remix's and watch horrible attempts at Super Mario 1. Then came the worst part, when i complained about the rancid smell  I got attacked by them. They started tickling me and pinching me with no mercy and someone gave me about 4 charlie horses in a row insisting that i did it to them 1st. i would NEVER wish that pain upon anybody nor do i even kno how to perform a charlie horse. Those dirty assholes can just wait till i learn ninjistu and then JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED!    Smelly assholes ; 1  Ninja ; 0

      Finally got the site looking like it  wasn't  coded by blind autistic monkeys with hot pokers under their feet. My posts will have the light blue text while Stoney's will have the pink text in the title, instead of that colored background shit. And of course the navbar on the right looks super duper clean and nice and stuff. ENJOY.

       urlLink Chris  linked my blog under the "Ninja" section of his links list. I think I should get a samurai sword or something now. By the way, did anybody see that lightning storm last night? I think if a ninja saw that shit he would be flipping out and killing people even moreso than ever.

      One time I was at my brother's house and I asked him what was for breakfast. He said "Raisin Bran" so I was like "I don't like raisins..." Then he thought for a few seconds and said "Bran." Damn him. I think I ended up eating toast or something. Yeah, shredded wheat is gay and hurts the roof of your mouth unless it's soggy from milk at which point it's already gross to the power of disgusting.  Honeycombs for life.

      This just in! Shredded Wheat & BRAN is fucken disgusting. Yes, it’s even worse than MINT. I realized this after filling up my bowl like hell and taking one torturous bite that made me see what a mistake I’ve made. I tried to give it to my cat but she just glared at me so I was forced to eat the whole bowl. A suitable punishment for not reading the warning on the box (aka the NAME OF THE CEREAL).

      For some reason Stoney decided to write about 5935 to the power of 18 blogs today (5) so you all have something to read if you scroll down a bit. In other news, there was a MEGA NINJA FREAKOUT FIGHT today after school in which I got to hold some people back from pounding each other even more than they already did. I think I lost my virginity somewhere during the fight. Sadly, there were no limbs lost/shuriken thrown.

      I just want to point out that Bubbalicious is the worst invention EVER. That being said I'll tell you about the lady who lives across the yard from Lindz.  Ok. In grade 6 or 7 me and Lindz started noticing a middle aged chink always washing her dishes in her kitchen. Lindz got out her binoculars and we spied on her for a while. Knowing nothing about drugs, we then made the educated guess that she was constantly MAKING drugs in her kitchen , and then on became known as "The Lady Who Makes Drugs" . Or sometimes just " the lady" .  Anyways , we decided to take it upon ourselves to punish this criminal and start shooting pizza crusts in her yard for our amusement. Sometimes friends would come over and join us. One thing led to another and the more snow came the more food we shot. At one point we had tomatos, bananas, eggs, bagels, Pizza Begals, Pizza Slices, Hotdogs, Unidentified Rotten food of any sort , Apples, cheese and peices of cake in there all at once because the snow kept piling up and she wouldn't notice until spring. One day , we had the bright idea of making what we like to call , a Creation. Creations consist of a coke bottle full of the nastiest food you can find, such as nasty cheese, oregano and other bad spices, eggs, mayonaise ( anything that will rot) , fruits, cereal, BAGEL BITES and other things that made it have a puke-like texture... anyways we fill a 2L coke bottle with shit until it smells extremly nasty. We also filled two ziplock baggies up with this creation and went out into the back yard. We launched the coke bottle and the 2 baggies and fell in the snow laughing before running back into the house. When spring came the lady must've had a great suprise, and also lindz grandma , considering we missed her yard a lot of the time.  Other times we would take out our Laser Pointers on boring Saturday nights and point them at the lady, one at her wall and the other one in her eye... She would then do one of two things, 1) duck under the counter or 2) look at us... If she looked at us lindz would usually pick up a kitchen knife at point it to her window in a threatening manner, when the lady ran away we would laugh and go back to playing Nintendo.   So yeah , this has been going on for about... 4 years now, and we still shoot the occasional food in her yard but we aren't AS interested. Until last weekend that is.We were devestated to notice the tree in her yard had been cut down. Assuming she moved  , we looked in her window, and noticed what appeared to be a new woman! We instantly pulled out the frozen chicken nuggets and started drawing swastikas on them with a black marker and launching them into her yard like there was no tomorrow. Then we noticed ... our eyes had deceived us... It was still the lady who made drugs... OOOO YEA!

      Ok the busride home from school has been a torture since the 1st day of school. Not only does it smell like someone puked in a sac of shit and shot it all over the bus, but theres all these retards yelling and pushing everyone. The bus driver then turns the heat on to about 95 degrees so everyone sweats and it gets wiped on you. Everyones school bag are packed to the rim so don't try to move around in any fashion. Oh yeah and don't forget the people that get on the bus on the way . These people include, Horrible french quebecers with BEAVERS on theyre head... I swear to god.. Ok wtf is it 1860? i really don't think its necessary to wear animal carcusses on your head in the middle of fall anymore sir...What makes it even better is I have to take it all the way to the end of the line and catch another STINKING bus there thats just as bad except its filled with delusional oldies who never know whether theyre coming or going. They always have about 40 grocery bags with them and expect you to give them your seat...YOU SNOOZE YOU LOSE OLD TIMER!  Ninjas : 1 ; Oldies : 0

      I'm currently at my brother's house due to family problems and my computer at home SHOULD be off. However thanks to  urlLink AudioMatch.net , I was able to catch my little brother on my computer even though I wasn't within a thousand feet of my house! I noticed that the site reported I was listening to Drowning Pool, even though I'm POSITIVE I don't have any of their songs on my PC. That means my brother must have been on my PC long enough to download the song and listen to it. AudioMatch's playlist also shows I have listened to tonnes of CKY last night, even though I wasn't home. Therefore we can conclude that my brother has indeed been on the PC for quite some time now. Tell me that's not fucking sneaky or something. I called him and before he could even say hello I screamed "GET THE FUCK OFF MY COMPUTER AND GET OUT OF MY ROOM!". There was about a second of silence as his mind tried to figure out was going on which was pure satisfaction for me.  Ninja: 1, Brother: 0

      It was very late.  I was trying to settle down for sleep, all curled up cozy in my comforter and watching the last of a biography on Cher when a black thunderbolt burst into the room.  Face covered in what looked like a pair of black underwear except for the wild eyes full of menace, the dark, gangly weirdo struck what was supposed to be a Ninja pose. It then attempted a somersault on the floor, i  it was such an awkward tumble that floor shook so hard the pictures almost fell off the walls. It shrieked hysterically and made a fast exit once it saw the potential murder in my horrified expression.  My daughter...the ninja idiot.     Ok that is my mom’s version of the story that happened yesterday. Here is mine.   About an hour after I was already assumed to be sleeping, I was in my room searching “How To Be A Ninja” on Google. I stumbled upon instructions on how to make yourself look like a ninja. Snickering mechanically I carefully put on my eye make up and wrapped a shirt around my face and neck the way the site told me to. Then I practiced some ninja poses before I made my attack. At just about midnight I attempted a ninja roll into my moms sleeping area (AKA the living room). It didn’t quite look as GRACEFUL as a proper ninja roll because I started laughing and I hurt my neck . So in a panic I started doing some summer saults. There wasn’t much room so when I felt my legs knock something over I sprang up. I heard my mom yelling but I couldn’t see because my warrior mask (aka black t shirt) was over my eyes. I started tripping everywhere and that made me laugh even harder which was making me suffocate. I struggled to get the shirt off my face so I could breathe and the minute I did I saw my moms glare. It appeared that she had turned into some sort of demonic sea queen while I was rolling around on the floor. I quickly vanished from the scene before she could attack.     The next morning I woke up to the sound of screaming from the other room like I told you usually happened on school days. “I’m toooo tirrreeeddd” I exclaimed… “ARGH ARGH YOU WERENT TO TIRED TO ACT LIKE A NINJA AT MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT” was the angered reply from the monster in the next room.   Ninja: 1 , Mom: 0     Anyways that’s my version. Who do YOU believe!  o_O! Oh yeah and here's the site if you shit heads wanna try it...  urlLink Be A Super Cool Ninja Warrior

      Holy shit it's been a long time since I blogged. Let's see, what happened in the past week or so.  I saw The Matrix Revolutions on Wednesday night, but bear with me for the delay since then because with about 10 minutes to go in the movie, there was a slow motion punch and my eyes  fucking exploded . It was pretty good, a little confusing and definitely worth your 6$ and/or climbing through an air vent to sneak into the theatre. I'm not gonna ruin it for you all just yet. Some people say Yoda is stronger than Neo but I think they're all dumb and stupid and possibly dumb. Neo could fucking explode Yoda and dodge his gay lightsaber before Yoda could even blink. And don't say shit like Neo only has powers in the Matrix because that argument can easily be countered with: a) Watch the third movie and listen for the explanation of his powers b) Yoda is fucking gay. This just in: Ninjas are awesome.  Umm, I also saw some drunk people downtown. That was probably the highlight of the week.

      You know that comedy thing people do where you take a joke that's really funny at first and you stretch it to the point where it's not funny anymore, except the fact that it's still going on makes it funny again? A good example of this is when Austin Powers is pissing behind the fountain in Goldmember. HILARIOUS!  It doesn't work if the joke isn't funny in the first place. DO YOU HEAR ME, IDIOTS? Scary Movie 3 was really extra not funny. Don't waste your money.

      So last friday was the halloween party where I got to take care of drunk people since I was the only sober one around... people do really dumb things when they're drunk. Someone told my friend that her eyes looked foggy and she yelled out "HELP I CAN'T SEE NOW" because she believed him, what a dork. I had to walk her around the block because she wanted fresh air but she couldn't walk in a straight line if her life depended on it. She falls in the wet grass on someone's lawn and gets covered with grass and dirt and just LIES THERE. I tell her to get up at which point she yells "I AM UP" and rolls around some more. The highlight of the night was probably when a random black guy walking across the street saw my friend throwing up in a bus shelter and screamed "YO GUY HALLOWEEN BE ABOUT THE CANDY MON NOT THE ALCOHOL" to which I could only reply "Ooo yeah!". Next party I go to I'm gonna make up for being sober at this one so be prepared for one hell of a blog whenever that is.

      I had an err... Interesting Christmas. Ok it started off with me and my uncle hammed around in my grandmothers living room. She had a christmas cd on, so we decided to sing along. Except it was the loudest and most out of key singing possible. When we asked my grandpa to join us, he said no and claimed we were making him sick. That just made matters worse for him , and we did it even more. The next day we went to my cousins to celebrate christmas again. The main event of the night consisted of me and my bratty cousins heffing my Schitzophrenic uncle with a spatula taped onto a hockey stick.  Well it started off with my cousin Nick continuously yelling at my uncle that the ottawa senators suck , and when he tried to protest he just interupted a hundred times like OH THEY SUCK! NO ... THEY SUCK!! until the point my uncle started screaming enraged jibberish at us , then we laughed in his face. Nick also did a dance around the room and in front of the tv sining a song about how the senators suck. This made him so angry that he went upstairs to watch the game.     Little did he know, theres some gay ass closet/attick thingy connected to that room. So while sydney stood in front of the tv and distracted him , me and nick slid a hockey stick with a spatula taped to the end through a crack in the wall and slapped him in the face a few times. When he yelled WHAT THE FUCK ! and punched the wall (because he couldn't see us or get to us in any way) i fell into a laundry basket and Nick pissed his pants for real.     Then while nick jumped around singing songs about my uncle with his new guitar, in front of the tv for the last 2 minutes of the game. Me and Sydney went in thru the ratty closet and started poking him with a different hockey stick . He dented the wall and screamed..ARE YOU HAVING FUN?! ARE YOU FUCKING HAVING FUN IN THERE YOU ASSHOLE KIDS!! i swear i never laughed that hard in my life.  I spent another good part of my holiday  watching jerry springer episodes at like 2 am . It's changed a lot since i was in gr 6. One of them had Hillbillies in love, where the audience chants , WE LOVE HILLBILLIES and do hic dances on stage to mock them . Or sometimes they randomly yell YOU SUCK! YOU SUCK ! and ppl asking questions often take off theyre clothes for some discusting reason. The fattest of heffers run around in thongs , and the ugliest people try to insult the hillbillies, even though theyre the ones with about 23 inches of hair under their armpits. The whole show is nasty, but oddly entertaining. Oh yeah , another new addition to the show, a stripper on a pole in the backround takes off her shirt and encourages the audience to make fun of the guests. Then the audience diss her and she flashes them as a response. Uh ... Yeah.  Hillbillies ; 1   My Uncle; 0

      WOOOOO I just got my Kodak CX6230 digital camera from Future Shop. 207$ on the dot. Now hopefully I won't pay about a billion more dollars on batteries.  So anyway for Christmas I went to Trois-Rivieres to stay with my brother's girlfriend's family. I expected it to be some log cabin in the middle of nowhere but it turns out that Trois-Rivieres is pretty much like LaSalle. The house had 2 PCs with high speed internet, satellite, DVD player... so I wasn't really bored at any point. I even got to play a little bit of CounterStrike while I was there. I won like 3$ playing poker and other card games... next stop Las Vegas!  Right now my friend is  urlLink sleeping  in my bed so I don't really have any place to lie down. I might just curl up on the couch though. And yes, that is my numbered pillowcase. Fuck you.  Shit, it turns out I desperately need a good image host. You can copy the link above by right clicking on it and clicking Copy Address, then pasting it in a new window. That should allow you to view the image.

      Well guys Christmas is tomorrow so I'm gonna wish you all a good one right now. I'm leaving in about two hours to Trois-Rivieres (I think there might be an accent somewhere in there) until the 26th. I'm pretty sure there's nothing resembling a computer within half an hour of that place so this will most likely be my last blog until I get back. Stoney's also going somewhere for some reason so this place will be pretty much empty. I'm sure both the people that read this blog will be very saddened by this touching news. Anyway I gotta go eat something before my trip so see you Friday or Saturday.

      I pretty much ignore Christmas. It's like one of those bullies who just gets in your face but if you pretend it's not there then it's not so bad. By the way, if you type .99 cents it's like saying you didn't even spend one PENNY on your grandpa. It's like almost a penny, but not quite. You cheap ungrateful punk.  Oh and for Christmas (I mean, for whatever holiday is going on now besides Christmas) I got a new keyboard. Take that, you old hunk of scraggly plastic that was trying to pass off as a keyboard for God knows HOW long.  Logitech: 1; Old keyboard: 0

When my mom brought me to the store to shop for my family, i picked up a paper weight for my grandfather in an attempt to HURRY  THE HELL OUT OF THAT HELLHOLE! and my mom yelled at me cuz i spend a gagillion dollars on my friends present and then try to buy my grandpa a .99 cent paperweight. Whatever, it's not like he deserves something better, like what i got him last year... GIRLS BUBBLE BATH! yeah , i got him pink peach bubble bath so he gets less presents and my grandmother gets more. Fuck Christmas. Also, today i took the whole dinner for the family , covered it in ketchup and brought it to my room. I ate half of the caserole out of the thing and put it back in the fridge with a fork in it, covered in ketchup. Take that, whoever made that stupid dinner. OH and another thing, one of lindz christmas presents from me this year, was a MOTHER MARY figurine, with an attempted decapitated head, and a burnt off face. I needed to take some anger out.

( Ur daddys panty line has been wearing thin, his diaper has been tight since the day he PISSED IN THEM!) - Hit or miss... or ( If you see Piss Pants, he makes me sick ,preschool's over, and he smells like shit) - if u see jordan... or ( If you could be my daddy piss pants, i could be ur daddy piss pants too, you can tell me how u just pissed ur pants, and how ull do it again) - Punk Rock Princess... lol ... also coming soon , The Dyking Soundtrack, featuring cheesy disco ham like Staying Alive - the Beejees. yeah anyways, where was i ... oh ya... we were playing in the snow and taking pictures and i did about 3 dives face first into the snow, 2 feeble attempts at ninja rolls, one horrible summer sault, another attempt at a flip , a bad try at a cart wheel , and i tried to help kayla do a handstand, which ended up in a two person dog pile and me getting my ass scratched by a picnic table.  We also had  a two person pyramid and i rode kayla down a snow bank like a SLED. Good times... anyways, Snakes a chink. And dance dance bat man is wicked. Also... we had a vicious dodge ball game against the boys today where Volleyballs should be conidered lethal weapons and only the retardedly lucky survive. Snake was probably partying with all the dancing bums on earth and i was at school getting balls whipped at me by the white men. That made me so mad.

      Holy shit. Most of you probably won't even believe this blog. I'm still wondering if I made it up myself.  In Montreal there's this street called St. Catherine which is made up of mostly clothing stores, arcades and strip joints. It's really packed every weekend with tons of people going to the movies or meeting friends, and is a big part of Montreal's nightlife. Anyway, me, Stoney and our friend Kayla went to play Lazer Quest (laser tag at 7.50$ a pop) on Saturday night. After that we were walking along the street when Stoney looked over and saw the greatest thing I have ever seen in my entire life, taking into account all the other things I might see in the future. Across the street, there was a bum, wearing a Montreal Canadiens jersey and a Spiderman mask, dancing to cheap techno music for money. At this point I would like to remind you that I am not making this shit up. We ran across the street and talked to him for at least five minutes, except it was pretty much just excited screaming. He said to come back next saturday and he would be wearing a Batman costume. He also wanted us to take a picture but we didn't have a camera on us. Then he gave us lollipops, which I didn't eat because I don't take candy from strangers. No matter how many superhero costumes they're wearing. Sometime soon me and Stoney are going back with a camera so you guys can have some proof. Anyone interested can go see him Saturday nights on St. Catherine street in front of the Cathedral metro entrance, or a little further down the road (he was pretty much across the street from Lazer Quest). Tell him those fucked up kids sent you.  No, I didn't make that up.

Their internet would be more reliable if I wrote a bunch of zeros and ones and sent them by carrier pigeon to their destination. I could outrun their packets. If it's not fixed in like... 20 minutes, somebody is getting a million ninja stars in their EYE.

      This is an important day in Canadian history. Not ONLY did I wake up before 6:30, which has probably happened only once when the house was burning down, my mom brushed her teeth  before  I took my shower. Some of you may remember my little  urlLink rant  about my morning routine. Well today all I did was wait an extra 2 minutes before taking my shower, and my mom said "Hey maybe I should brush my teeth before you go in there." At this point I calmly yelled "YES NOW YOU SEE!" directly in her face and jumped around the room. I think the neighbors might not like that, but I don't like when they play outdated songs from 1991 at max volume all day long. In case there was any confusion, Snake is Stoney's nick name for me. It kinda comes from a teacher calling me Jake the Snake, and kinda comes from her being such a drug addict and doing 80 lines of coke before class every day. Also, I have the song that goes "Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow, everybody needs a bosom!" in my head now. Stupid song.  Just thought I'd edit this in: Read  urlLink this  page now. If you don't laugh, please tell me so I can beat a sense of humor into you.

      So me and kayla come in to school today for the english exam en?  but first we had gym , and i was heffed as hell and tired and sick. so first we sribble the football around in a hammed fashion. Then the teacher tells everyone to get in line, at this point where we were standing, two people face one way, and i start walking away. then i realize i was going the wrong way and go stand with them. The teacher comes and goes NO OVER THERE!! so we bunch up in the direction i was heading...this seems to be happening all over the class so it's not only us who were utterly confused.  SINGLE FILE !!! he yells.. he means in a horizontal line but of corse we all line up vertically. NOT PILED UP ON EACHOTHER U DICKHEAD, just , side by side. yeah . He gets heffed and places us where we were supposed to go . Then hes like GET WIDE!GET WIDE! by this time im in that crouching SHUT UP I CANT TAKE IT HAHAHA position and i yell WHAT DO YOU MEANNNNN WIDE!and i dont get a response, well maybe i did but god knows i was laughing too hard to hear it. He rushes in front of the class in fear of losing the lines he just made because everyone has the attention span of about. wait... what was i talking about ? ... lol.. no .. ok... then yah , he starts jogging around trying to explain what a hook play and a slant and everything is to a bunch of 16 year olds with the brain capacity of 2 year olds before he loses our attention again and has to start all over. The look on his oh so flustered face just got me and i burst out laughing for the whole time he explained. I think i was crying and holding onto kaylas shoulder while slapping my knee. It wasn't like someone said a joke, i was simply laughing at his face. He knew too because that made him even redder and that made me laugh even harder.  Then the drill started. Two passes were thrown before everyone was like WHERE DO I GO?? HERE? WHATS A SLANT! CAN I GO TO THE BATHROOM? WHATS A QUARTERBACK!etc etc. by this time the teacher is almost in tears and i think he is almost suicidal and i think i just blew a pissed my pants 15 times in a row. Also , i don't have Scurvy anymore. This just in , Snake speaks chinese.

      So me and kayla are both sick as HELL. When you think about someone sick as hell you think about them in bed like arhghhh :S kinda like M at his birthday party except he wasn't sick he was just drunk and we wasn't in bed he was in the mud. ANYWAYS me and kayla aren't sick in bed, we're both on MSN laughing about CHING CHONG and YO STAKE! IM blasting music and that sneaky beef is eating 7 krispy kremes and a whole pepperoni. Id probably be doing the same but my taste buds have been eliminated , Or something. We just stay on here and laugh all day while those poor suckers at school are struggling over the English exam and hamming theyre way through the rest of the school day. On another note, our friends in LaSalle Catholic are probably doing the same, AKA SNAKE i hope you're getting scratched up in gym class and balls whipped at ur gimped arm by the black men. This just in, Scurvey rocks. That's right, I said it.   And another thing, i just got a picture of my newly married aunt and uncle as a christmas card type thing ... can't they waste their money on something a bit more hilarious?  WHAT YOU SAY :O Ohhh yeah , that CEAL D crack head finally e-mailed me an appology for mailing me all that bullshit, the last letter was even about her friend getting an abortion. Don't you feel smart!

      Ok ! So i look in the mirror , I look so fucken hilarious that i start to laugh at myself. My hair is screwed as HELL , and my face is even whiter than normal , none of my clothes match and im always fucken sweating or freezing to death. Never mind the fact that i probably have chicken pox or scurvey or something, now i look like a 20 year old dog who hasn't eaten in 27 years. Also, I think that Ching Chongs Guide To Ninjas and Codes and Stuff is funny.

OH yeah , what were we talking about again? THEN the TV has the excellent idea of putting a dislexic baby with mechanical eyelashes on that wears a book on his head as a poor excuse for a hat and the mom "tickles it" with one finger... that makes me so mad.

      Today our gym class did the dreaded beep test. Let me explain what this  beep test  is. You play this standardized cassette on a stereo while you run back and forth in a gym between a certain distance. Every time a beep plays, you must be at the other end of the gym. If you don't make it in time, you stop and you get a certain mark. Basically, it's beep walk beep jog beep jog beep run. So at the beginning, you can take your time but when it gets to around 4 (the number isn't the number of beeps but rather every 4 or 5 beeps it goes up half a number) you have to speed up. We got to 11 but the teacher stopped it at that point. I was kinda happy cuz I could go and pass out but I also wanted to continue to see how long I could go. Now I have about 80 forms of cancer in various parts of my body and I'm so hungry I might eat this keyboard (I'm in computer class, and finished my assignment). I think I'm gonna go play something at MiniClip.com now.

      This is some dumb little thing where me and Stoney write what we think it's like to be the other person for a day.  06:00am: Wake up to sound of Dad stumbling around hallway in search of nourishment. Go back to sleep. 06:30am: Mom wakes me up, I throw nearest pillow/bracelet/alarm clock/cement brick at her. Try to get some sleep. 07:00am: Mom wakes me up again, so I yell "GEEK YOU" when I mean to say something else. I think she gives up now. 08:45am: Wake up for last time, realize I'm late for school. Too late to do anything about that now. Eat gigantic bowl of Oreos trying to pass it off as cereal. Take 40 minute shower, take about an hour to get dressed (all girls do this). 09:35am: Get to school, tell principal I was too drugged up to find the bus stop. He believes me and replies by going "YO GUY!". 12:00pm: LUNCH TIME! Time to smoke drugs with all my friends, throw salad dressing at people and play hackey sack. Lunch is pretty much like the rest of the day, except we smoke now. 12:30pm: Take my time getting back to class so I can take a nap in the park. 01:00pm: Back in class. 50% of students are stoned, and teacher is hungover. 03:00pm: TIME TO GO MEET SNAKE AT THE METRO 04:15pm: FUCKIN HELL I'VE BEEN WAITING HERE 30 MINUTES AND HE JUST COMES IN NOW SMILING LIKE AN IDIOT! 04:15-05:30pm: Laugh at random things with Snake, including stupid babies and Pat One. 06:15pm: Get home, mom wonders where I was and why I can't stop laughing. 06:45pm: Eat supper while giving my pet cats large quantities of table scraps even though my mom tells me not to. Dad says something to me but I ignore him. 07:00pm: Talk with Snake on MSN about the daily events some more, think of blogs, check e-mail etc. 10:00pm: Mom tells me to go to sleep so I tell her I am then stay up anyway. 12:00am: NINJA ROLLS IN MOM'S ROOM WOOOOOO 12:15am: Sleep now. I'm going to be tired tomorrow.

      I'm totally forgetting about this "typing like an idiot" for a week thing. I can't fucking do it. I'll type something, then look at it and think "How can I make this seem stupider?" then erase like 16 letters and replace them with 2 numbers. I just can't do it.  Today was such a crap day. I woke up in a super great mood thinking that I would like find a treasure chest or something on the way to school. I should have gone back to bed. The day itself was pretty boring and I was so damn hungry I almost fainted like six times a minute. Finally last period I had gym and we were finishing off our handball tournament. In the Finals I got scratched, shoved and pushed onto the floor and we lost 4-2. I was all tired and out of breath and injured and had to go to the mall with a friend for Christmas shopping. There, I see Lindsay C., the girl that went with Stoney to Toronto. She tells us this gigantic long story of the best day of her life and then I have to come home and read it again on here. I start getting angry and Stoney is all like "You should be happy!"  Yeah, I go to school and get the crap beat out of me (and STILL lose the game), almost waste away from food deprivation while you're off in Toronto getting into Blink concerts for free and probably doing cocaine with every rock star on Earth and I'm supposed to be happy. I fucking hate you, Stoney.

      Ok so , the original plan was that i go to toronto tuesday in an attempt to see blink 182 without a ticket for the show, or permission from my mom . Kind of like HEY MOM IM IN TORONTO SEE U TOMORROW sort of deal.  Me and my friends Lindsay and Cayleigh bought our 100$ bus tickets last friday , and later found out that the interview at much music was cancelled. Monday i was taking a nap and lindsay c calls me and says BLINK IS COMING TO MUCH!!!!! Then at like 9:30 i decided to tell my mom we were going because apparently there were no busses coming home past 9 ocklock and we would have to stay there overnight. My mom basically said, Why didn't you tell me, i would've helped you plan it. UGH!:@ lol . anyways . Ok so , At 6 am on Tuesday lindsay C picks me up and tells me shes not allowed staying overnight but it was ok cuz there ended up being a bus leaving at midnight. We go to Berri Uqam with Cayleigh. On the bus, we made signs that said like PET MY CHESHIRE CAT! and WE SKIPPED SCHOOL TO COME HERE FROM MONTREAL . Cayleigh sprayed a man in the face with gel while he was trying to sleep and he woke up like WTF EN. When we got to toronto, he told us where much music was and gave us good luck for getting into the show since he heard all our conversations. We ate hotdogs on the way that we put mustard mayo bacon bits relish pickles and ya it was gross lol . ok so we see much music and almost get hit by a truck trying to get there, but we claimed "it doesn't matter" . We got in line, and got the last 3 wrist bands to get into the interview!! During the interview, Mark tried to talk to someone in the crowd but was interrupted when Lindsay yelled WE'RE FROM MONTREAL!! then they said, why hello:) Je Va Au Plage! lol we also got autographs and i dyked in speakers corner the way snake told me 2. Then we shopped around a bit and ate at a mcdonalds FULL of blink fans, hardley anymore we talked to had tickets. Apparently they were impossible to get because the show cost 1$ and it sold out in 7 minutes. We heard stories of ppl being in line for tickets since 630 am and even the ppl first in line didnt get any. Someone even clicked Buy Now on the internet the second it turned 10 ocklock and they were already sold out! So it looked like we werent gonna get in, but everyone wished us luck anyway.  The show was supposed to start at 8, so we took a Street Car there, and i talked to this lawyer who apparently used to be a punk with green hair and listened to the Exploited back in her day . Pretty weird. Anyway we got to the place at like 6, and found out the tickets were going for two hundred and 50 dollars!!! YA RIGHT!! so we just stood around kinda , we didnt kno what to do. Then a Guy came from inside the place. He asked for our names, and said to give the ppl inside our ID to get into the show. We were like for how  much $$? hes like " Free."  Lindsay C and Me...BURST INTO TEARS!!! i never thought that would happen but it did!!! So we got in line for 2 hours in the freezing cold and sang 99 bottles of beer on the wall , with the rest of the line. It was funny and great. Then we got in the show, and i got killed in the mosh pit, it was super amazing and fun! I got punched in the mouth and now i have a fat lip, i got slammed onto the floor and fucked up my rib . I lost my shoe like 39 times and i have bruises everywhere. BEST. DAY.EVER! after the show, we took a taxi to the bus station and slept all the way home.. Now i just have to tell my dad that we went on  a feild trip with school to Toronto the way my mom told me to O_o!

      So not only is my physics science fair project due on February 2nd, but my partner's parents are absolute fucking nazis when it comes to school or play or work or home life or food or anything beginning with a one of 26 different letters. They make him do his projects under pressure two weeks in advance ALL the time, he can't watch one TV show without them yelling at him about studying or working or preparing work or some shit like that even though he fucking studies like a madman (and it doesn't even work that much in the end). I think if I saw this kid's parents in a dark alley, I would stab them in the throat and bury their bodies in my backyard. The best part is that supposedly they think I'm a nice kid.  Well not too long ago my partner comes online telling me to write the project as soon as possible (I already planned on writing a little bit each night, up until when it was due, but now he wants me to do it ALL in one night) because his parents won't let him go on a field trip if they don't see the finished project. I was at his house Friday and they were acting all fucking bitchy and crabby about the fact that it wasn't already finished. So basically now, I can control whether or not this guy gets to go skiing this week... good luck, buddy.  Oh and here's the e-mail with typos bolded. Looks like all that studying didn't pay off, eh nazis?  ok look  i   tryed  to  tel  my parents that you  all ready  had the  writen  part done so that they don't have to see it  put  they want to see it and you have to write it up good i don't care about the mass of the golf balls  adn  i need the pic so by sunday night i can have everything done i know you so i know you can write up a report in like 15 min so can you plz plz write one up today  wich  is sat or by sunday night plz pl plz you don't understand how  importan  this is ty sorry by the way for the  hush  (I think he meant rush)  And now, translated into English:  MY PARENTS ARE FUCKING DIPSHITS WHO ARE TRYING TO CONTROL MY LIFE AND BY DOING SO ALSO TRYING TO CONTROL YOURS. PLEASE BURN MY HOUSE DOWN AND SPARE NO SURVIVORS.

      HOLY FUCK I just got my dsl connection back and it feels  so  good. I almost died, I was approaching 2 weeks with no internet access from home. But just as things looked even worse, I plugged the modem in (from where my brother unplugged it to plug in his phone) and it WORKED! Now even if I got hit by two...  TWOOOOO ... trains and had my limbs hacked off by rusty knives, this would still be a good day.  AxcessNet still sucks, though.

      So I decided to actually give my dad 15 minutes of my time today and i found out his intake on reality shows... " Fear factor, Bullshit factor, Fat factor, Ugly factor, Obnoxious factor... they're all the same to me... i dunno whats coming next and i dont really care either" . Lmfao. He basically just took fear factor and put a bunch of random adjectives in it and pretended they were actual shows.. On another note, Funniest Home Videos is actually hilarious as HELL. I almost choked to death when two little kids dressed in super hero costumes tried to wake up theyre dad , who was sleeping in a towel for some reason by singing and dancing by his bed. All of a sudden you hear the mother "GET EM BOYSSS" next thing u know this little GIRL nails the dad right in the balls lmfao that killed me. Other funny videos included a small girl trying to swim to shore while a deranged goose pecked her head in an angry fashion. Or some oldie getting pushed into a lake by a goat, or some 40 year old dyke that fell down a water fall.  My dad ; 1  Bullshit Factor ; 0 Funniest Home Videos; 10

      Yea so my parents were arguing agressively about money ..like who owes who what and where all the money went ... so whatever i decided to take advantage of this tense situation by standing in between my parents and screaming at my dad for not giving me back my 50$ ... and wildly accusing my mom of promising me 25$ if i went to school , to make matters worse... they tried to ignore me but i just ranted louder until they asked me to leave. I decided to go heff the cat for a while... I started off..'GUMBY! WHERES THAT 50 BUCKS U OWE ME??"  when she didnt answer i tried to remind her about the good old days when we were sweethearts in college... doesnt that mean anything to her anymore? lmfao ... then my mom heard me from the other room and told me to stop annoying the cat... NOT UNTIL I GET MY MONEY BACK... I told her.. Also , snakes mom is locked in some closet and he's started anarchy in his house... He can no go to bed as late as he wants, and he has internet back.  Woo Ninja Style! Ninjas: 1 ... Gumby: -50$

      So for the past week I haven't had internet access from home. Anyone wanting to hear the story can gather 'round.  For three months AxcessNet doesn't send any bills so naturally my mom can't pay for the service because she needs the invoice number to write on the check. Of course instead of calling AxcessNet and asking about it, she ignores it until we get the Account Deactivation notice in the mail. It seems this ISP thinks that sending a letter telling them to pay for the bills the didn't send makes some sort of sense. Anyway I freak out and my mom pays the $120.62 needed to make up for the past three months. The same day, she calls to make sure they know the check is on the way and to let them know NOT to cut the service. They say they already got the check (the same day) and it won't be cut.  Then I get home and the modem isn't lighting up, and I can't connect. Fuck you, AxcessNet. So one week later my mom sends a check for the month of January's service which should re-enable the account. Of course, this may happen tonight, and it could happen in two weeks. Too bad I have to play in a CS match tomorrow night and don't even know the map I'm playing. For all of you who don't understand CS matches and everything, let me make it short. If I don't get internet by tonight, I'm  screwed .  Fuck you again, AxcessNet.

      Due to the fact that Snake hasn’t been online for the past three days, I’ve come to the conclusion that his mom has now decreased his bed time to 315 , or whenever the hell he comes home from school. Maybe now he won't be so tired at school and he might just remember to finish his science fair project. Oh yeah and yesterday when the English teacher asked me what my oral was gonna be about, i panicked and blurted out ninjas, not realizing there is absolutely NO real information about ninja's available on the face of this planet. Excellent. I suppose I'll just construct my own guide to ninjas and codes and stuff and pray for a passing grade. Some friends have urged me to ninja roll into the class with a shirt over my head, as seen at midnight in my mom’s room a few months ago, but i think i have a bit more dignity than that, maybe. Hmm what else, I wonder wtf snake is doing. Oh yeah i forgot he's sleeping. Probably with his fucking Blues Clues Teddy or something. Oh yeah and today when i tried to search Dust Bunnies on google because my friend wanted a pic of them , I stumbled upon countless sites about how Lunette the clown is fat, and parents complaining about their kids shoved the toys under the couch cushions after watching the show in attempt to pose the 10 second tidy . I even read something about someone’s brother "abusing himself to the site of Lunette the clown" ... It's a sick world. There was also a complaint about the Dust Bunnies posted because they made the daughter upset and have trouble sleeping at night. HaHa. Uh yeah that's about it.  Hanson; 1 Snake; -3 Ninjas; 1 i guess Lunette the clown; 0

      So I had about 3 hours of sleep last night and have been awake since 2am. Of course today is back to school after two weeks of vacation. I pretty much just started to forget about school and my science fair project and all that. This will probably be the worst Monday ever.  On a side note, I'm going to fucking  murder  Stoney. She sent me this song yesterday with a filename of unknown246.mp3 or some crap like that. I assumed it was this song that her friend wrote that I had heard about so I listened to it. I told her it was good but not really my style of music. Then she pulls some ninja move on me and tells me it was Hanson's new song. Holy fuck, I said Hanson was good. I hate you, Hanson. I hate you too, Stoney.

      Ok i was cleaning my room out when i found this cheesy cd i used to own when i was 10 . Um it consists of pop songs sung by other artists, like Spice Girls covers and other cheesy stuff of that manner. Just before i was about to shoot it out, i decided to give it a listen for old times sake. Now as i listen to Mmmbop and Get Down sung by what sounds like drunk 15 year olds, i sit here wondering wtf im doing.

Shoutbox is coming soon, or whenever I get around to it.  Still have to fix my AudioMatch.net image and possibly a few other things but tell me if you like the new layout by clicking the comment link at the bottom of this post.  And by the way, Stoney. That picture of you is staying like that until you get a job! Bunn you!

      So anyway a few months ago I saw this site called www.playcs.com which was free e-mail for gamers specifically Counter-Strike players. I thought, "Hey, I'm a gamer, specifically a Counter-Strike player, so I should sign up!" and soon enough streak@playcs.com was my e-mail account. Since then I have signed up for probably about a dozen different sites using streak@playcs.com as my primary e-mail. There was about two weeks of server downtime at playcs.com meaning I couldn't get into my e-mail. I thought this was acceptable since I didn't really NEED it that badly, but that it was still pretty annoying. So, after it went back up, there was a short period where I had e-mail. Then, it went down again. For like 3 weeks. The only difference was that this time, there was a notice on the main page saying that they would be back next week better than ever! I figured I could wait through this.  Today, PlayCS.com has been turned into a forum and the e-mail accounts are all gone. To sign up for an account, you have to pay 3 US dollars (minimum) and even if you do this, all your old saved e-mails are erased no matter what. So basically, without warning, PlayCS.com erased quite a few relatively important e-mails I had saved, then had the nerve to ask for money so I can keep my account.  I am not happy, and I can assure you the day I pay money for PlayCS.com's e-mail service is the day they implement the "do your homework" feature. Not that I do homework anyway.  Oh, and the shoutbox is a little messed up right now but I'm too busy to fix it. Maybe soon.

      Holy shit I really haven't blogged in a long time. So now to both my loyal fans I present to you with a description of one of my major pet peeves:  You know when you take the metro and go to get off at your stop? Well how it usually works is everybody gets off, then the people who were waiting to get on approach the train and go through the doors. It's just like, understood that that's how it works. You just fucking  know . Well, I can't STAND when people try to get on the metro as soon as the doors open even if there are people waiting to get off. If someone is getting off, it makes no fucking sense to get in their way, block them, or shove past them when it makes no difference how fast the metro leaves. The whole "I'm in a hurry" excuse is invalid, because the metro still has to wait for the people to get off for it to close its doors. I don't understand how any human smart enough to figure out how to pay ticket fare and walk down a flight of stairs can not grasp the concept of letting the metro empty out before filling it up more. It just lacks so much common sense it makes my head hurt some times. Oh, and don't get me started on people who actually shove past people to get on the metro. I'm getting angry just thinking about it.  In other, non blood-pressure-increasing news, I got my SIN today. Basically this means I can legally work in Canada to get some freakin' MONEY. It's about time. GO ME! GO CANADA!  Edit: The spell check on this blogging hoodickey tried to correct the following words: blogged (You'd think they would know what it meant) fucking (It's a real word, people!) freakin' (I can understand this one, I guess) CANADA (What the fuck? It also suggested I replace it with "CANADA". Real smart spell checker there) doohickey (Kind of expected)  Edit2: I spelled doohickey wrong the first time. Hahahaha, hoodickey.

      Hello. I am here to tell you about a bad time Lindz had at one of my birthday parties . She thought it would be another wonderful day , we were all joking around and she was laying on my floor unsuspecting the bad tragedy that would soon happen. The uninvited beached whale perched herself on my bed in a standing position, and before any of us could do anything, that fat mean girl named Sally pounced on Lindz like two heffers over the last peace of greasy chicken. She nearly squeezed the life out of her, releasing the first and only time I ever heard Lindz scream like a girl. Knowing that something must be terribly wrong for this to happen , we all piled on top of stupid sally in a scandalous dog pile only to get kicked punched pinched and bit by the devistated and half alive... Lindz. R.I.P LINDZ , I hope you're eating chicken nuggets in heaven.

      The "en" you see me and Stoney using all over the place is kind of an inside joke. It is kinda making fun of stereotypical Italians who add "en?" to the end of their sentences. It is pronounced more like "an" with a... hard A or something. Some examples follow:  Let's go eata some pasta en? You maka no sense en? What the fuck, en? (This is where the title of the blog comes from)  So don't read it as "What the fuck, 'n'" anymore. It's "What the fuck, en?" Anyway, that joke just got unfunny by explaining it so I might rename the blog real soon.

      So I'm still kinda sick from earlier on in the week, except now my throat is cleared up and my head is stuffed up. So I get the genius idea to put this minty cream on my schnozz to clear up my nose. It's kinda like Vicks VapoRub except not Vicks. Now the fumes are going directly into my eyes and water is pouring out of them nonstop. Seriously, there is a tear every ten seconds or so. Hopefully when my mom gets back with the Neo-Citron I'll feel better.

      If you ever  tasted my mothers cooking, you’d probably DIE in comparison. My dad just begs me to ignore him by screaming at me and calling me a jackass. Oh yeah , pretty good story, why don’t you go back and tell it to your grandmothers dead WHEELCHAIR. That’s right I said it, and I’m angry. I’m angry at all these barfing bitches they call models. These bulimic bimbos spend their time trying on trendy shit and banging Hanson all the time. Bunn that. If it were up to me, they’d all be dangling into a pit of bitch eating jelly fish. I’m not trying to say that I don’t eat seahorses, heh I mean… who doesn’t? But seriously, where the hell were these models raised? Ethiopia? But it still doesn’t explain why their wedding dresses look like they were dug up from their great grandmothers grave. Like really. Then, THEN , they have the nerve to rape all three members of Hanson before me or Lindz have a chance at them. Well that’s the last straw, if I ever see a model, I will force feed them a big mac , or maybe I’ll just feed THEM to Dance Dance batman.  On another note, I just read this article in the messenger about William grants bully box. I talks about how OMLY  50% of the messages are pranks. Hold on while I hyperventilate. The opening line is what got me. “ William Grant checks one of LCCHS’ bully box for anonymous cries for help. He pulls out a chewed piece of gum. “  . Excuse me sir, but are you a fat fucking pig?  I also had a good idea of trying out for American Idol and spinning Simon around on his computer chair while singing a hilarious rendition of You Spin Me Right Round.  Then I realized we live in Canada eh and I got an even better idea. Since the host of the show’s name is Ben Melrooney, and I don’t KNOW that fat judges name, I’ll just do this.  Me: *dykes in* WHEN I WAS AYOUNG WART HOGGGGGGGGGGG! Fat Judge: That was the worst fucking thing I’ve ever heard. Me: Hey, HEY  MEL MELROONEY! SHUT YOUR PIE HOLE! Fat Judge: Uh miss? That’s not my…. Me: YA MEL MELROONEY, YOU FAT FUCKING SWINE! Fat Judge: That’s not my name… Or the host of  the show’s name. Me: STFU *ninja roll out* Oh by the way , Gary Benzo… if you’re out there… Brush your fucking teeth, before somebody else does it for you. Models; -33034834983   Gary; ew Me ; 4

      You know, Honey Nut Cheerios is just about the best tasting healthy cereal you can buy. Yeah, you could buy something like Alpha-Bits or Trix or whatever, but those have been known to cause SARS, cancer, heart attacks and hysterical pregnancy when consumed in large amounts. And, your teeth might suffer because of all that damn sugar. Honey Nut Cheerios is supposedly good for you, AND it tastes good. Since when is that possible? So next time you go to the store, tell them STREAK SENT YOU FOR HONEY NUT CHEERIOS and tell me if they kick you out or not.  Yesterday I didn't go to school because my throat was sore and my head hurt and stuff. So now I have to TOTALLY GO TO THE OFFICE AND GET A NOTE! ISN'T THAT CRAZY!? I BET NEXT I'M GONNA HAVE TO SHOW IT TO MY  TEACHER !!!  Too bad my life doesn't sound as exciting as I'd like it to be.

      The following is a message directed towards everybody that was involved in the creation of Need For Speed: Underground.  Can I live in your pocket?  Seriously though, it's an awesome game and everybody that plays videogames should give it a try. I usually don't like racing games so it was a big surprise for me to like it this much.  So in other news, my science fair project is almost done with and then I can rejoice like I've never rejoiced in my life. Last night I had a three person conversation in the dark with a strobe light going off, it was just about the trippiest thing in the universe and now I'm guaranteed to buy a strobe light for when I move out. Speaking of moving out, some friends and I have this crazy plan to live together starting this summer. It would be me, Stoney, and two other friends in a four and a half... sharing rooms and splitting costs. Talk about pure unsupervised chaos. If this plan comes together properly I am inviting everybody I know under 20 to a house warming party. And of course there will be absolutely no alcohol or drugs, whatsoever*.  I'm going to go play Need For Speed now.  * KIDDING!

      So I ended up getting to the LAN at 11 on Saturday and let me tell you the wait was worth it. Over at the  urlLink gallery  you can check out some pictures they have, and I may upload mine soon. The place was 100% full to the brim with people (443 in total) and everything went great. I got myself a new mousepad as well as won a new fan controller, fans, neon lights, fan grills, thumbscrews and a car lighter adapter for my PC through the random giveaways. Now my PC is green and blue inside with a fancy prancy knob panel for adjusting the lights and fan speeds. GO USA!

      So I'm supposed to get a ride to this LAN party tonight, right? The guy tells me 5:00pm LATEST is possible for him. So I cancel plans to get home early so I can unplug and pack my PC. This is at around 4:30pm. The time is now 11:50. My PC has been plugged back in since 10:00pm so I could check where my ride is. See, almost seven hours have passed since the LATEST possible time he was supposed to be here... not an e-mail, instant message or phone call to let me know he wouldn't show. And now at the last minute Stoney invites me to her house except I waste too much time trying to get a hold of my ride to make sure he doesn't show up at my house at 12:30 with me in LaSalle, and it's too late to do anything but go to bed now.  If I had known I would only be going to the LAN tomorrow, I could have gone to see Dawn of the Dead with an assload of friends then slept over somewhere. I wouldn't be replugging my PC in just to check on the status of my ride.  Let's just say I'm not in a particularily good mood.

      Has anyone seen those Tropicana orange juice commercials? Where some random person sees someone else drinking orange juice, they are overcome by jealousy and steal the juice using a hilariously* long straw? The few shows I watch a week are constantly interrupted by this shitty ad. Doesn't anyone ever notice that it's amazingly unrealistic and unlogical?  First off, if I turned around and someone was drinking my orange juice I wouldn't look up and smile at them like I had just won the lottery or something. I would probably bitchslap them like the woman in the commercial should. When someone steals your stereo do you see them in court and smile at them as if you were best buddies? Even if it was my  friend  who was swiping my juice I'd bitch at them. Second, why is the girl that steals the juice on a cruise if she can't afford to buy herself a damn glass or orange juice? Either Tropicana is trying to say that women or cheap or their product is expensive. I hope somebody got fired for that one. And third, the whole concept of sucking juice up through a straw that's 6 feet long it pretty stupid. If you didn't pass out first, the juice would mostly leak out through the gaps in the places that the straws are stuck together. And don't even try to say that it's just one big long straw because who the hell brings a 6 foot long straw on vacation?  It's a shame, too. I still like their orange juice.    * Not hilarious.

      I have pretty much stopped watching TV for the past year or so now. Of course there is still the occasional show when I'm bored, and I watch movies on my computer a lot, plus watching TV while at a friend's house... but that's pretty much it. Then how is it that I know who  urlLink William Hung  is?  First, about American Idol and why I don't like it. Every single show (besides the last few which I can't force myself to watch, mainly because Jenny Gear destroyed my eyes last time) can be predicted with the following layout:  Random singer tries, sucks badly. Simon shows disrespect and elitism by laughing while the person is singing, and looking away in boredom. Paula Abdul smiles and sometimes dances along with the singer, even if they are terrible. Hey, at least she tries not to hurt their feelings. Randy is kind of neutral between nodding his head to the music, looking away if the person is really bad or just sitting there being fat, which is what he seems to be best at. Then, Simon will say "You're terrible, thank you for coming.", Randy will say a sentence containing no less than three occurences of the word "dude", and Paula breaks the news that the person has potential but just isn't what they're looking for. Occasionally, someone good will come on and everything will be different (Randy still says dude a lot) but it happens so little that I don't even care anymore. And don't you dare forget about the end credits where the worst singers from the show rant into the camera about how Simon is a bitch and that they're really good and nothing can convince them that they suck. Including the fact that everybody thinks they suck. 90% of the time, the person who is whining will be black, gay, or both.  BONUS: Oh, and sometimes the judges convince each other to give the guy a chance because he looks like he has talent, and then one of the judges will change their decision and the singer goes "OH MY GOD THANK YOU SO MUCH" and cries. Randy says "Good luck, dude" and the show goes on.  Now, back to William. This guy sucks. But in the good way. Instead of trying to defend himself in front of the judges at American Idol and making an idiot of himself (for an example type "black girl on american idol" into Google) or verbally attacking them, he admitted his defeat with the simple line "You know, I have no professional training in singing." Thanks for the news flash. Of course, now he has a record deal, his own website and thousands of fans.  Maybe I should give Canadian Idol a try.

      I've always wondered what it must be like to be a vegetarian. Do you get some kind of a membership card? Do you get 15% off on video rentals? Where do I sign up? But I think the biggest thing I wonder about is: How on Earth do you do it?  I don't think I could go without meat for one week. I find meals start to taste pretty average without a big hunk of meat in my mouth every once in a while. Sure, I've had vegetarian meals before... vegetarian lasagna, soups, pastas and a few other pretty tasty dishes but I don't think it would always be that easy. For example, I couldn't just make a sandwich when I get hungry. Of course, I could make peanut butter sandwiches but I'm honestly not too fond of them anymore. Being a high school student, the very few vegetarian meals they offer in the cafeteria every once in a while look pretty scary (even moreso than the other food-like substances they serve there). Another big factor is that I don't really like cheese. I can stand it on pizza, or a little bit on a salad or Subway submarine or something like that, but in general I don't want a big lump of rubbery cheese in my mouth. This leaves me with very few options if I were a vegetarian.  Oh, and did I forget to mention just how  good  meat tastes? Give me a good old-fashioned hamburger over a tofu salad any day. My vegetarian friend once told me she had a BBQ with her family during which she ate hamburger buns with mustard on them and not much more. First of all, that sounds so  boring . Knowing I could be chowing down on steak instead of a plain old BUN would be torture for me. Second, those buns probably contain minimal amounts of the recommended daily intake of... oh, I don't know... EVERYTHING? Even for a small guy, I like to eat a lot, so I would probably have to eat like five or six hamburger buns just to satisfy my hunger. That's a lot of buns.  You may have seen the videos at the  urlLink PETA website  protesting the meat industry and whatnot. I have and let me tell you right now that they're not friendly suggestions anymore. Slaughterhouse footage, debeaking videos, throat-slitting... they send a strong message. It's a shame these things are happening, but I just don't think I have the willpower to be a vegetarian right now. Maybe in a few years. So for now, it's "Sorry, piggies. Sorry cows, chickens and turkeys. Sorry pigeons, rats and old newspaper shreddings (I enjoy the occasional hotdog now and then). You just taste too good."  My name is Jake, and I am a Wannabe Vegetarian.

      Some of you may know me as that crazy nutjob from  urlLink Absolut Blog  and some of you may not. This blog was started to serve as a little more serious weblog that some people may find just as interesting as my other one. In short, there is going to be less "HOLY SHIT NINJAS ARE COOL" on this blog*. Oh, and I'm the only poster here (for now anyway).  I 100% coded this site myself so it should stay like this for quite some time. I may change the color scheme if I get bored, though. Now, stick around and the fun will begin.  * Ninjas are still cool, though.

      For the past week or so there have been mice running around in my room. I'm not sure how many but I would assume it's more than one. Anyway I was just on the PC when I heard one of the little fuckers scratching around near the corner of my room. I went over and realized that he was inside this old PC that was on the floor. It's one of those really old 486's that is wider than they are tall, and a panel is missing from the front of the case. I assume that's how he got inside.  So I tilted the case and sure enough he ran up to the panel to try to escape. Once he saw me looking back at him, however, he ran back inside. Stupid mouse. Then I propped the case upright with the open panel facing up, and stuck a paper towel in the slot where he came out of. I am now the proud (not really) owner of a pet mouse. Of course, I can't see him, but I can hear him scratching at the walls of the case trying to get out. I wish I still had my cats so I could put the case in the bathtub along with the cat, and let them fight it out. Mice can't climb bathtub walls very well so it wouldn't turn out very well for the mouse. I'll probably shake the case out over the bathtub and drown the little guy. Hey, it's a shame but I sure as hell ain't letting him roam around my room anymore.  Oh, and you know the guy that always leaves 2 drops of milk in the carton just so it looks like there's milk left, then when you go to pour yourself a glass all you get is barely a mouthful of milk?  No, I'm not him. I hate that guy too.

      It's been a while since I updated this thing... guess I've been too busy doing  nothing .  Most of my level went to the Europe trip this week so now it's 19 days of free periods and random chaos in school. There are like 10 people in some of my classes... the teachers just basically say "Do what you want" and we talk for 50 minutes. Every period. I guess it would have been nice to go to Europe (5000$) but this ain't bad either.  I applied for a job at Subway the other day and I will probably apply to another one closer to my house soon. If I get this job you'll probably see me expose all the rumors behind Subway like the toppings are two weeks old or they don't bother washing their hands or whatever. Most likely, I'll just whine about French people though.  You see, the only reason I specifically chose Subway is because of the simplicity of their menu. You can order a 6 inch, a 12 inch and maybe a cookie but that's about it. I can barely make out what a lot of French people are saying most of the time because of how fast they speak. Working at a McDonalds, with their huge menu, would probably confuse the hell out of me to the point where I burn the place down. Now Subway, on the other hand, has a relatively simple menu. Even the meats are universal in some cases... "steak", "roast beef" and "tuna" are examples of this. If I get real lucky, mostly English people will show up and I won't have to bust out my crappy French. Oh well, that's what I get for living in Quebec.  Lately I've been playing a little bit of Battlefield: Vietnam which is what I'm going to go do now. Before I go, I just want to leave you with something special.  You know that guy who always says the punchline to a joke before someone else can? He'll usually stay quiet during the joke's setup, but at a point just before the punchline is ready, he'll proclaim it to the world because he's already heard the joke before. Usually just before the joke teller finishes his sentence, he'll step in and take over. Example:  "What's the opposite of Christoph--" "Christopher Reeves!"  Of course, the setup was "What's the opposite of Christopher Walken?", but this guy didn't wait for that part to come before finishing the joke himself. Almost every group of friends will have this guy in it.  I'm that guy.  Sorry.

      So everyone is currently obsessed with either their newfound acceptance letters to college or the upcoming grad night. When I'm not hearing someone say "I GOT ACCEPTED INTO JOHN ABBOT BABY WOOOOO" as if the person thinks that the president of Canada just personally invited them to attend Harvard, I'm hearing about hotel rentals and prom dresses and limos and afterparties.  I don't get how you can get so worked up over prom. It costs you about the entire yearly budget of a small African country for one night. Then you leave the dance to change clothes and get as wasted as humanly possible. Why don't people just skip all the stuff inbetween and go right to the parties afterward?  I'm probably going to spend around 86$ total for prom night. Instead of renting a tux I can just buy one of those white t-shirts with a bowtie drawn on. Classy  and  affordable.

I just went to the CN Tower and took a bunch of pics which I'm currently uploading to Yahoo! Photos. So I'll paste the link at the end of this post.  We went out for breakfast at this restaurant called like Charlie's Charbroil or something, but they wouldn't serve me because the health detector said nobody under 18 years old is allowed in the restaurant because there are smoking sections in it. What the hell? In Quebec you're lucky if your food DOESN'T contain more carcinogens than the average ton of asbestos... here they don't serve you because you might sue for getting cancer in their restaurant? Anyway I just waited in the car while the guys I was with ordered for me and that was that.  So here's the  urlLink link , eh.

      Well it's been confirmed that I'm going to Toronto on Friday afternoon and leaving some time on Sunday. I'm probably going to leave school at lunchtime tomorrow because we have to arrive in Toronto relatively early to set up at the LAN, so that's sort of a bonus.  I'm thinking of redoing the site to a kind of roundish, bubbly design, but I'm not sure yet. I'm way too busy with the huge pile of homework that every teacher seems to be piling on during May, which is another reason why I love my school so much.

      Wow, it's been a long time since I've updated. I'm trying not to forget about my two readers but it's really hard when I'm spending all of my time playing StarCraft or Diablo II on BattleNet.  Speaking of video games, this past weekend I attended  urlLink PureLAN 6  hosted by LQJR. All in all the event was great but they had some pretty crappy Internet which made playing on BattleNet sort of a pain. Apparently the tournaments had some problems but that didn't affect me as I'm not skilled enough to bother with them. Lan ETS is still better than LQJR, though.  This weekend coming,  urlLink TFL  (Toronto Fun League) is hosting a LAN party in Toronto. I may be going to this one, which would also be my first time to Toronto. So that's pretty cool, I guess (dorky cool).  If I do go expect pics and a writeup here.

      Whoa, where the hell do I start this crazy post. Me and my date went to meet a bunch of people for this kind of pre-prom party thing. That wasn't anything special but here's a picture of it anyway.  urlLink     Then it's off to the Ritz Carlton in a red Pontiac Grand Am (what can I say, I like to splurge) to go pretend to be happy to see our teachers and eat 95$ food. Here is a picture of Ryan Burns which sums up the entire event.   urlLink      In this second picture we have a hairy beast and Stoney on the right.  urlLink     Here is the hotel room we rented for the night. Kayla is on the left while Alex is standing up and Bryan is sitting on the far right.  urlLink     A bunch of stuff happened here where I forgot to take pictures or was to busy tending to people while they threw up repeatedly. We didn't drink or smoke anything, though. Honest.  At 2am we decide to go to McDonald's down the street. Everybody can barely walk and the McDonalds is full of drunken teenagers screaming some nonsense about graduating.  Soon after getting back we go back outside to not smoke. Note the following sober people:  urlLink     Half an hour later these two fall asleep and people randomly enter our room. A whole bunch of people are asleep in the other rooms so the ones that are still up come to stay with us.  urlLink      urlLink     The rest of my pictures are mainly people passed out on floors which isn't anything too unexpected. I'm gonna try and get some more off my friends and upload the good ones here. For now here is a bonus picture of Bryan.  urlLink

      My internet should be cut off any minute now. It just stalled for a few minutes which reminded me to write something to let you know where I'll be.  I have to get a job before my mom will hook it back up so tomorrow is a good day to start handing my CV out. That internet cafe place turned out to be a hellhole and I'm too young to work there anyway. So now I have to try and get a job at Subway or McDonalds. For real this time. I mean it.  No, really.

      I told myself I wouldn't go to bed past 4am tonight. I told myself I would get some sleep in before 4, so I could wake up at noon at the latest. I told myself this because I woke up at 6pm today. Even though I managed to make plans with Stoney, I still missed out on a lot of free time. I told myself I would go to bed, wake up, have a big breakfast then maybe look for a job. I'm telling myself now that it's 5:17am.  See you all at suppertime.

      A friend just recently informed me that her friend is looking for someone to fill a spot at a local LAN cafe type place. Basically the job involves sitting in a chair and tapping at a computer randomly whenever somebody walks in. I figure I might as well get paid for what I do in my spare time so I'm gonna try to get the job. My only worry is that somebody will realize how great the job must be (christ, do I ever NOT want to work at McDonald's) and get it before me.  I'm not usually a praying man, but if you're up there, please help me Superman.

      I stopped blogging for a bit mainly because every time I think of something good to say I forget it by the time I get home and get discouraged, but now I promise I will try to let all two of my loyal readers know what's going on more often.   Anyway I come back to blogger.com for the first time in around a month and they've totally redone  everything . That includes adding a whole bunch of fancy new templates which I think I will use from now on. The old one was nice but a change is good once in a while. I don't really feel like writing a new template so this will have to do for now.  What's new? My prom is in two weeks and I need a summer job, desperately. That's what's new.  Here is a picture of some  urlLink ducks.   :(

       I woke up at 4pm yesterday, then played video games until midnight. My friend picked me up in his car, we drove to Tim Horton's and stayed till about 2am. Then we came here and watched The Mask on VHS. He passed out on his couch and here I am posting at 6:33am.   Summer + unemployment = freedom.

      Uh, so without internet my house is apparently pretty boring. I've been coming over to my brother's house to use his computer most of the time. No luck with the job search but I have an assload of CV's to hand out tomorrow (if it doesn't rain). If I get lucky I'll get hired at EBGames. &nbsp; Other than that I went to both the Jazz Festival and Just For Laughs in the past week. Jazz Fest was pretty much just tourists and drunken frenchmen poking you in the back for about an hour and a half trying to get a better view of whatever was going on. Then when you turn around to leave people push you forward out of their way and you get angry and leave. &nbsp; Just For Laughs was pretty good though, a bunch of outdoor stuff going on like acrobats and kangaroo costumes and music. Triumph the comic insult dog is in town but it's 33$ to go see his show. If I was rich I'd be going, but maybe I'll get a glimpse of him outside making fun of French people. &nbsp; It's raining a lot in Montreal which sucks a donkey's ass cuz it's really humid and hot in the morning then rainy and cold at night. Oh well.

      So anyway the other day me, Myke, Nick and Nick (who shall be known as Farmer Nick and Nick with the Fro, respectively) went to the mall to waste some time. Some time in between trying to play free Xbox at Future Shop and staring at some kids play Dance Dance Revolution, we decide to pool our money together to get a 4 litre tub of ice cream and some spoons so we can eat it outside. 10 minutes and 7 dollars later, we're sitting outside Maxi on the patio chairs that they were displaying and scooping out ice cream with these cheap plastic spoons that are barely the size of a bottlecap.  We looked like dummies but it was worth it. A few people comment on us on the way into the Maxi with stuff like "That ice cream looks good" and stuff like that. Then, this random old guy who looked at least 60 years old walks up and says "Eh boys, having a picnic or what?" in a really strong generic old Italian man accent. Farmer Nick offers him some ice cream and he sits down at the table with us for a good ten minutes and eats ice cream with us. We talk about the weather and whatnot until we're ready to leave. I guess he went into the Maxi after that, but I wouldn't be surprised if he was just a hobo in a nice shirt trying to bum some ice cream off us. Either way he was the coolest random ice cream eating old man I've ever met and is worthy of the title Ice Cream Dude.  That's my story.

        Public transportation in this city was better. A lot better.   I had a job.   Stoney wasn't in Ottawa last night.   There were fireworks every night.   I had my high-speed internet again.   My biological clock wasn't totally off.   People weren't so afraid of teenagers. Last night we kept telling groups of people "Happy Canada Day" but only two of them answered. Jerks.   I was watching the movie Snatch right now.   Lists were easier to make.

      Am I the only one that doesn't give a shit about Halle or her new movie Catwoman. Not like it's a shock to anyone but apparently the movie did pretty badly at the box office. Jesus christ did that movie look like a vortex of shit or WHAT. Of course that doesn't stop E-Talk Daily from trying to hype it.  Just before it was released the local entertainment news show tried to make people see it by showing clips from an interview spread over a few days. I think they split the interview into parts so that the intended target audience, who wouldn't remember anything past two hours before the show itself, would fail to realize that all the interview consisted of was Halle and one of the absolute worst human beings I have ever seen on TV talking about that goddamn whip and her leather outfit. I think whoever wrote the questions for the interview must have drank a gallon of LSD then scribbled down any question which might be interpreted as something related to cats. Here's the gist of it:    Awful man : DID YOU GET HURT WHILE USING THE   WHIP  ? I BET YOU TOOK A LOT OF CATNAPS ON SET EH! THAT  BLACK LEATHER  SURE WAS  SKIMPY , YOU CERTAINLY ARE A ROLE MODEL FOR ACTRESSES ALL OVER!!   Halle : YEAH FILMING WAS REALLY THE  CAT 'S MEOW!   AM : IF YOU REALLY HAD NINE LIVES, WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN YOUR NEXT ONE?   H : EAT LOTS OF  CATNIP  LOL   AM : HEY WHEN YOU WERE USING THE WHIP DID YOU EVER FEEL SEXIER?   H : OH WELL I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT ON TELEVISION!   AM : WHAT'S THE MATTER?  CAT  GOT YOUR TONGUE?!   H : OH YOU CARD! THAT WAS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED!   Me : GIVE ME CANCER NOW   Sorry to use caps but it's really necessary to show how fake the interview sounds. I think what E-Talk Daily did was just replace every word above with something similar in the thesarus, then play it on TV the next day and pass it off as a different interview. The only reason I sit through that shitheap of a show once in a while is to remind myself of why guns were invented.  That, and I really hate how everyone is like OMG HALLE BERRY IS SUCH A LEADER AND SHE'S A GOOD ROLE MODEL and shits their pants when there's nothing really special about her.  PS: whip
