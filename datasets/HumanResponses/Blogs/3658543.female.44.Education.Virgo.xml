      My boyfriend threw his back out Monday, so I decided to stay at his house. When I went to leave, Dad asked me where I was going and when I'd be back. When I told him he said "you'll be back tonight" and I said, "nope" so he said he's ground me if I didn't come home! So I told him I'd be back after 11 PM (knowing that he goes  to sleep at 10 PM)and he seemed happy with that. The next morning I got home before he woke up and I asked him, "are you happy, I was home last night" and he aid he was. I feel like I'm being unethical but it does avoid tension and fights. My 49 year old single brother lives in the house too. He told me that dad asked him the other day if they had gone golfing that morning or the morning before. He told my dad they went golfing that morning. He hadn't taked dad golfing in months! Michael said dad was happy. I feel bad about this and told Michael about it, but he said what's the harm. He thinks he went, he has a memory that he went, what if he didn't really go? It still seems unethical somehow. It's hard to see dad's mind slowly slipping away. I asked him today if he could name my dogs and he couldn't (i've had my youngest one for 6 years). Dad says he's depressed and asks what is good for depression. I tell him (as I've done hundreds of times before) that it's the ALzheimer's Disease making him depressed and that he's taking medicine for it.  For Father's Day I gave him a candy bar and took him to a movie. We can only take him to movies that are uncomplicated. He can't remember the plot from one scene to the next. We saw "Dodgeball" on Father's Day and he said he liked it, he laughed a lot through the movie. We saw the Harry Potter movie last week, he thought that was the worst movie he'd ever seen! Dad always seems to need to know where mom is. I guess that she's his lifeline. Mom is finally swimming two times a week, so we make sure either Michael or I stay home so she can go, or she takes him with her. When she goes without him he askes several times over the two hours where she's at. He doesn't want to be alone, so we make sure he isn't left alone. I hired a student nurse to come over 4-5 hours a week to "entertain" them, take them on errands, talk and listen to them, to help take the burdon off of me. Mom's still opposed to it, but so far she's cooperating. So life is interesting at the moment. My boyfriend's back is hurting, I'm in a walking cast due to a muscle tear, my mom has diabeties, and Dad has Alzheimer's Disease, getting old is hell, to quote my dad. Lisa

               New Page 1         Mom and Dad moved in almost 18 months ago. It's been hard for me. Mom is 77  and has diabetes, Dad just turned 80 and is (thankfully) still in stage one of  his disease. I've noticed that his memory has been slipping a bit these past few  months. This morning he didn't want to go golfing, and he lives for golf. He's  been complaining that living until 80 is too long, that 77 was good.     He knows he has Alzheimer's Disease, we don't hide anything from him. I know he  understands that he has it, but it's difficult for him, he gets so frustrated  with himself at times. Today when I was getting Teh-Rah, Ripley and Callisto  (the dogs) ready for their walk, Dad was surprised and asked &quot;You have three  dogs?&quot; I've had all three over 7 years.    With the death of President Regan bringing Alzheimer's Disease to the forefront,  I only hope a cure is found soon. It truly is the &quot;long good bye.&quot;
