      Not too much to report thus far today.  I've only been up since Noon because I didn't fall asleep until about 4am.  Just doing some cleaning and getting ready to go to Lafayette GA tomorrow for my interview with the Parole Office there.  Prayers are appreciated.  I can actually see my computer desk top again!  Yay for cleaning!  I came across a cool CD, buried in the heap, someone once made for me called Chipperiffic tunes.  That's what I"m listening to now...good stuff.  Thanks for the CD, person who made it for me that I won't name by name, out of respect for an agreement entered into in April, but you know who you are.  My dog is pretty restless today, all she wants to do is play!! Sheesh!   If you're reading this, leave some comments so I know it's being read! Anyway, that's all for now, be good!   Blessings and peace

      It only took me about 30min to come back!  watching TLC, great channel!  I wonder if part of me is feeling lonely since I don't really have any friends in this stupid freakin' town!  Gas is getting too expensive to keep travelling to Augusta and besides which, I don't have the money to keep doing that!  I think this Sunday, I might search for a new church home.  Better yet, maybe I'll go to the church that fired me for no good reason!  Wouldn't that be an interesting experience!!  But alas, I couldn't do that!  I may be bitter, but I'm not vindictive.  I generally try to avoid confrontations, therefore, going to that church, probably wouldn't be in my best interest.  Besides which, I couldn't sit in one of those pews in good conscience and take communion from someone I don't respect.  Along the same lines of not being vindictive, NO one has anything to worry about, I've taken careful steps to watch what I say here and in various other places to make sure that it doesn't seem like personal attacks etc..etc...because i have NO reason to attack ANYONE personally.  That's just stupid.  I don't have the energy for that kind of thing nor would I even want to go down that road.    Hard to believe I was fired 3 months and a week ago.  Feels like only yesterday.  having had a couple of poor experiences as a church employee, really makes me wonder if I need to be in ministry at all anymore, volunteer or paid.  Even though, ministry is awesome and I know I still have a strong desire to do ministry.  yeah maybe I contradicted myself, but who cares! This is my place to vent!  I just know that Youth Ministry isn't where I need to be at this point.  Ahhhh....friends...you make some, you lose some and you keep some for life.  I wonder which ones I'll keep for life!!  I have a pretty good idea of the ones that probably won't be around much longer.  Oh well....such is the game of life.  It's funny how one day, you can be great friends with someone talking and hanging out all the time, and then the next day you don't talk anymore. Is it something I did? Hmmmm..who knows!  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't....at this point in my life, I don't have time to play stupid middle school games with people.  You're either my friend or NOT!  Seems like this happens with the same people all the time...maybe I need to just cut the baggage and move on!  I guess I just expect more from the people who want me to call them my friend.  Funny too how I'm always there for them to listen and give advice, even though it may not be the right advice, but when I need an ear...where does everyone go? This isn't aimed at anyone in particular, just a general observation I've made.  I thank those of you who are there to listen when I need an ear, you know who you are!!  Ahhh yes...3am..and I'm rambling...venting, being pissy.  Who cares....this is my place to vent!  And it feels so good!  Anyway....i'm gonna attempt to sleep again.    Blessings and peace to one and all.

      I figured I'd jump on the bandwagon and try this for a while!  Heck, it might even do me some good to put my thoughts down on something.  Why not for the whole world to see?  I've been suffering from a horrid case of insomnia for the last week, I can't seem to fall sleep before 4am.  It really sucks, especially when I'm attempting to try and find a job.    yeah, this whole job search thing, sucks pretty bad.  I can't seem to figure out what the problem is and why I can't get a job.  I've gone on a few interviews, but other than that, NOTHING!  There was a day when I could just walk into a place, have an interview and leave having a job.  But that doesn't seem to be working right now!  OH well...I'm sure there's a lesson to be learned from all of this but what that is, remains a mystery to me.  I think what I need is some good quality God time, alone in a secluded place such as Honey Creek.  I always feel God's presence on that Holy ground, away from the hussle and bussle and NOISE of everyday life.    Anyway, that's about all for right now I guess.  Check back periodically, there may be updates! There will probably be an update or 2 tonight! Since it's 2:24am as i write this...once again, not finding sleep!

      Not me! That's for sure!  I've been here at truck driver training for almost a week now.  I don't think I would've ever seen myself driving a truck.  But...it'll be a fun job for a while I think.  Don't have to worry about anyone being constantly over my shoulder telling me what to do etc..etc...as I've mentioned though, desparate times call for desparate measures.  This is probably the only job I could get that would pay me pretty decent.  I certainly can't work for minimum wage and pay rent and bills etc.  I'll actually be making MORE money than I was in ministry.  Not that the money is the issue.  I need time away from ministry to get reconnected to my passion I once had for it.  I look at this experience as a mission field.  It's exciting to think about the ministry opportunity that I can have as a truck driver criss crossing the USA.  I'll be able to spend lots of time getting in touch with God as I drive down the road.  I guess you could call it my mission field at this point in my life.  Some people may frown on me driving a truck for a living, but I say to them, are you too proud to do what you have to do to make a living?  I certainly am not.  That's why I'm here.  I just ask for prayers and encouragement as I embark on this journey and chapter of my life.  I drove a truck for the first time today on the ROAD and it was actually easier than I anticipated.  I caught on to the shifting pattern quickly even though I've never driven a stick shift before.  These things have 10 gears in them!  It requires double Clutching to find your gears etc...it's a bit of getting used to, but once you get it, you're money.  It was an adrenaline rush today believe or not. I wanted more! Gotta work on my downshifting and stops but that'll come with practice.  Of course, I aced 3 of the 4 tests to get my CDL permit yesterday and made a 97 on the hazmat section. Not too bad in my opinion.  Then I was evaluated very well today while driving the truck my instructor was very good and patient and gave me lots of positive feedback.  Anyway, I hope everyone is doing well.  It'll be a while before I post again I'm sure and it'll be a while before I'm able to communicate via IM.  I'll probably have to start communicating more via the telephone once I get out on the road.  I'll be home in 2wks after I finish training, stay home about 1.5wks for a wedding and then I hit the road for 4-6wks with a trainer and then I'll get my own truck and start makin' the bucks!! wooohoo! Just pray I make it through everything. I don't want to get too cocky.  Yeah, so what if I have a college degree....apparently those don't mean much anymore these days.  In 4 months of unemployment, I managed about 5 interviews but no job offers. Oh well....such is life.    Blessings and peace to one and all.  Drop me an email sometime, I'd love to hear from you!

      Ok....so I hate moving! I'm so tired from helping my buddy move!  Moving in the 100% humidity and upper 90's sucks bad.    Anyway, ok so this has been a pretty decent weekend though, considering the move.  Tomorrow is my nephew's first birthday party!! It's gonna be a blast!  Woohoo!    Awkward moments this week with a couple of friends. I believe they have resolved themselves.  Amazing what you can accomplish when people actually talk to you about what's bothering them.  Thanks for that.  I give and I give and I give but there comes a time when I can't give anymore and that happend this week with said friends.  Thank God things are resolved!    enough!  time to attempt some sleep possibly.  Have a nice day!

      Not much to report today....just tired as all get out.  I'm in Atlanta right now getting ready to help a buddy of mine move from Augusta to Atlanta.  He'll be starting Law School in August.  Interesting...never thought this dude would go to law school but more power to him.  He's quite the entreprenuer.  So anyway, I'm tired, so I should probably go.  Sorry about the post from the other day!  I was having one of those everyone and everything is annoying days.  I'm better now...but I still mean what I put.  Time to clean the friendship house again.  Never hurts to get rid of the dead weight.    So father's day is coming up this weekend, not really a fun day for me anymore.  I think this year i'm just gonna give my mom a father's day card, because, she's now both parents since my dad isn't living anymore.   Ok..ramble..ramble...ramble...time for me to attempt some sleep.  Nite!

      Well, it's come to my attention in the last few days how ignorant some folks can be.  People who you think are friends turn out to be just exactly the opposite.  At this point in my life, I have no time to play stupid games with people.  My energy needs to be focused on other things.  If you read this and have an overwhelming feeling that I'm talking about you then I would suspect you're making a correct assumption.  I wash my hands of all the people in my life who tend to look down upon me or treat me like a piece of dirt.  Face up to it folks...if you got a problem with me, tell me, don't run from me, that only makes it worse!  Adults usually communicate their issues with each other.    ON to bigger and better things, I may potentially have a job, I'll know on Monday! Not something I would've seen myself doing, but desparate times call for desparate measures!

      You know, as I walked my beloved dog earlier, I realized that God truly is amazing.  I walk her in an area away from the traffic and apartment buildings etc....it's a very dark area at night.  The last few nights, especially tonight, I saw how beautiful God really is.  Lighting bugs are amazing.  To think God created these little bugs with lights in their butts that light up at night, is just simply amazing.  God truly never ceases to amaze me.     Granted, I'm sure I disappoint God on a daily basis. I don't spend as much time with Him as I should etc....but I know that God loves me no matter what I do.  I'm really trying to see the Good in all people and see the good in the situations that have occurred this year.  It's difficult to do...but I really am trying.  I love God and I love serving God. THere's nothing in my life that gives me as much joy and peace than serving God.  Therefore, I'm going to apply to a few different mission programs and hopefully, go overseas and live out my baptismal covenant for a year.  Then upon my return finish discernment and go to seminary.  Doing a year of mission work would be an incredible experience and quite valuable as well.  Thanks be to God.    In the mean time, I'm still attempting to find work....I am going to have to resort to a few of the things on the bottom of my priority work list....like trucking for instance!!  Me...a trucker?  Sheesh, what's this world coming to!!?  but if it will pay the bills...then so be it.

      There are lots of things that make me go hmmm......let's see....just to name a few, what on earth am I supposed to be doing with my life?  "friends" acting like 6th graders about situations, my dog running in crazy circles, lack of employment, lack of money, things that people do in the name of God and the list can go on.    I'm in a big state of Hmmmmm right now....seems as though some doors and opportunities might be opening up and I'd like to explore them.  There's a program through the church called the Young Adult Service Corps for folks 18-30 who want to do a year of mission work abroad. The program is also used to help discern if Holy Orders is in one's future.  I think it would be an incredible opportunity to serve in this way.  After all, Jesus calls us to serve him.  It's time to get out of my comfort zone and serve.   Anyway, I think I'm gonna go get some food, i'm hungry!  And there's NOTHING to eat in this house!

      I knew that the sunny days and no humidity wouldn't last forever!!  Maybe I spoke too soon!  I walked outside about 20min ago and goodness, I about died!  Humidity is BACK!  ARG!    Anyway, well, I have decided that I'm going to actively pursue finishing the discernment process.  A friend asked me the other day, "Are you sure you're over your bitterness toward the church?"  My reply went something along these lines, "I'm not really bitter toward the corporate church.  There may still be a lil' bitterness toward my previous employer, but hey, that's expected.  This is something that I need to move forward with instead of continuing to put off the inevitable."  Which is the truth, it's been 4 months now since my unjust firing and well, it's time to get on with things.  I guess I need to be more aggressive in finding a job.  I'm currently looking for something in or around augusta.  That way I can be in the same town where I'm doing discernment!  I figure that if I'm gonna go back to school, I might as well just do what I'm called to do and hopefully go to seminary.  I have a question...DOES ANYONE ACTUALLY READ THIS??  Just curious, feel free to leave a comment if you read it. Thanks!

      I saw this on someone else's blog...figured I'd try...this is what I am.....find out what you are!    urlLink     The final book of Narnia, you're a sometimes disturbing story about the end of the world and the beginning of a new one.  Your characters include an evil monkey, a misguided donkey, stubborn dwarves and all the human characters from the previous books. You manage to be heartbreaking and beautiful at once.    urlLink Find out which Chronicles of Narnia book you are.

      ARG....I'm really starting to get sick of this whole insomnia thing!  Why can't I ever go to sleep at a regular hour?  Sheesh!  Anyway, here i sit....at 2:52am not able to sleep. I know i'm tired...I just can't seem to fall asleep.  Oh well, such is life I guess.

      I'm in shock!  It's been sunny here in middle GA but what's even more shocking, has been the lack of humidity lately.  I can't believe it's been comfortable during the day and at night. Normally, it's hellish.  You can't breathe when you walk outside.  This is a very unlikely turn of events in GA weather.  I suspect it won't last for long....so I will enjoy it now!  Well..I'm still unemployed...haven't heard anything from the latest round of interviews.  I think I might just move back to Augusta and actively pursue putting the finishing touches on my discernment process for Holy Orders.  As I reflect and update my spiritual autobiography, I STILL have a strong desire to be in ministry fulltime.  The idea of some kind of chaplaincy is top in my line of thinking at this point.  I've thought for many years of doing military chaplaincy or some other form of chaplaincy.  So...I will put things in motion this week as I finish up my spritual autobio and send it to my supporting priest at my home parish.  and then we can begin really getting into this whole discernment thing.  I ask you to pray for me as I try and figure things out.  Thanks!  Blessings and peace.

      Ok...so it's been a few days since my last entry...oh well.  I just finished watching a VH1 special on AIDS..and let me tell you, it's amazing how we can become so complacent in our lives that we forget all about this disease.  This disease is destroying lives all over the world, right in our own backyard and especially in Africa where drugs aren't attainable.  It's killing whole communities of people in Africa.    You may ask, so what's the big deal?  Why are you so fired up about this?  Well...I can only simply answer that question this way....strange how God works, I've seen several things over the last month about AIDS...during Third Day shows and now this special on VH1.  And as I think back, during the President's State of the Union address.  Each time something about AIDS is presented...I'm moved to tears.  Maybe this is God's way of saying, "Hey Jeff...open your stinkin' eyes.  Do your part!"  What my part is, I don't know, but Thank God for his grace and meercy.  Maybe my part is to do AIDS related work..I don't know.   I do know this...folks...AIDS isn't going away anytime soon....in fact, the number of people infected is rising!! And guess what??  It's our age group....(18-30) that are seeing the most increase in infections!!!  Time to get smart....if you're gonna have sex use a condom..or better yet, just don't have sex. It's as simple as that!  Please visit the following sites:   www.youthaids.org www.psi.org   Let's start doing our part....God calls us all to love our neighbor as ourself...so let's do it!!  Let's come together to help fight AIDS!  Now that I have that off my chest, hopefully I can get some sleep!! Just waiting for these sleep aides to take effect!!    Peace all! urlLink

      Well the weekend draws closer as I write this.&nbsp; I'm wondering if there's any kind of bachelor party for my friend getting married this weekend?&nbsp; Probably not since I haven't heard anything yet.&nbsp;   Spent the evening at the mellow mushroom last night had a good time with friends that I won't see for a while.&nbsp; Had a couple drinks! Boy....I'm either gettin' old and can't handle my liquor anymore or it's been so long since I had any liquor that it takes a little less to make me buzz. Because last night, after 1 long island iced tea, I was feelin' pretty good! lol&nbsp; The 2nd was even better!&nbsp; Made for some interesting discussions!   Anyway, my buddy derek had this little test thing on his Blog so I decided I'd jump on the bandwagon and do it..here are my results...interesting they are...accurate...somewhat:           Big Five Test Results

      Damn, I'm such a white boy!&nbsp; I realized this past weekend I haven't been swimming or in the sun at all this summer so far!! I have the world's worst farmer's tan. I took my shirt off on Saturday and was almost blinded by the amazing white light I saw.&nbsp; And I finally got around the shaving my head bald, my usual summer hairdo, and damn....my bald head is TOO white!! compared to my face and neck!&nbsp; So I've taken it upon myself to visit with the sun the last few days, tryin' to soak up some rays etc....without burning too terribly bad!&nbsp; I've managed to get a little color to said chest and head...although, the sides of my head are struggling, they're still white!!!&nbsp; Anyone have any suggestions as to how I could get some sun on the side of my head without having to lay sideways at the pool? lol&nbsp; I also have a terrible case of the sandal feet! lol....the sun just doesn't want to give me color on my feet or sides of my head!  &nbsp;  I've recently been reading the blogs of a good friend of mine...who I encouraged to blog..and they really are quite humorous!!&nbsp; If you want a good laugh...please visit  urlLink http://silentparade.blogspot.com &nbsp;and leave Travis a message!! He will delight in knowing you've read his blog!!!&nbsp; They really are funny..especially if you're an 80's child like us!  &nbsp;  Wow, I can't believe&nbsp;a good buddy of mine&nbsp;is getting married this weekend!&nbsp; You know you're getting old when all of your younger friends are getting married before you! lol..oh well....marriage isn't in the cards for me at this juncture nor is a relationship.&nbsp; (which I never seem to have any luck in anyway, but that's ok...I'm used to it! lol)&nbsp;  &nbsp; Although, I have noticed quite a trend with folks I've showed any interest in over the last few years...they always tend find "THE ONE" after talkin' to me a while.&nbsp; So...if you want to find your "THE ONE" just come on a date or two or show interest in me and then let's end it...and your "THE ONE" will soon come to your rescue!&nbsp; (Girls only of course!) I guess I can take some pride in knowing I've helped propel many people toward the loves of their life!!!&nbsp; May all of you be continually blessed!!!

      Well I'm finally finished with my CDL training!!&nbsp; Never had any doubts.&nbsp; I'm back in Macon now trying to pack up my Apartment so I can put the majority of my stuff in storage.&nbsp; I'm going to get out of my lease!&nbsp; No sense in keeping an apartment if I'm never gonna be around to be in it!&nbsp; Just makes more sense to crash with mom or friends when I'm not on the road, which will be like 4-5 days a month.  &nbsp;  I've been thinking a lot lately about all kinds of stuff, particularly relationships with friends and family.&nbsp; I can't even begin to put in words how grateful I am to everyone for standing by me in difficult and trying times, although some shut the door on me.&nbsp; But that's ok, I may not understand it, but I'm sure they have their reasoning, however flawed it might be.&nbsp; There is light at the end of the tunnel, my almost 6 months of unemployment are coming to an end thankfully and I'll be working again.&nbsp; Might not necessarily be my desired career path at this point, but I see this as an adventure.&nbsp; I'll be able to experience things that most people don't ever get to experience, I'll be able to see our beautiful country for free and most of all, I look forward to my time that I can get in touch with my God.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I've been pretty out of touch with God lately. Probably because I haven't had much faith in the direction my life has headed etc....I can't think of a better way than to go out on the road and be alone with God for a while.&nbsp; This is kind of a mission trip for me.&nbsp; I have no doubt that I'll have good stories to tell and use later in my ministry.&nbsp; The ultimate plan is to still head to seminary at some point.&nbsp; I thought about heading overseas for a year...but don't know about that now...it's been almost a month since I requested information from different places and haven't received a single shred of info from any of them. Maybe it's just not meant to be!  &nbsp;  My mother is the BEST mother in the entire world!&nbsp; I don't know what I would've done without her in the last several months.&nbsp; And now, she's going to keep my dog for me while i'm on the road!&nbsp; I'll miss that dog!&nbsp; My mother has helped me so much and I am eternally grateful.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I figured I'd drop a post today!&nbsp; I tried posting the other day, however, it wouldn't publish! ARG! Hope everyone is doing well! Blessings and peace.

      Ahhh....I'm finally finished with my CDL training.  It was a long 3wks but I did it and I'm glad I did it!! I can drive big trucks now! lol....who would've thought??  Not I!! lol...Anyway, it's been a long 3wks, and it sure is nice to be back in civilization.  That town I trained in didn't have ANYTHING to do!! It was terrible!  I felt like a trapped animal.  I won't start driving with my trainer for a couple of weeks because I have some things to take care of before I go away for extended periods of time.  Anyway....I hate to see people struggling...seems while I was gone a few folks have gone through some difficult times, don't know what about yet, but all I can do is pray.  I hate to see people struggling.  For those of you who are struggling right now, you're in my prayers.  anyway, not much else to report.  Well i'm sure there is, but I dont' feel like typing anymore!! Peace to one and all!

      That's the only way I can describe myself right now.  I guess this is good practice for when I'm going to be out on the road all the time.  I'm more excited than I thought I would be about this adventure in my life!  I actually can't wait to get out on the open road and drive a truck.  I'm pretty pumped about it.  I think I'm probably pumped about making money again!! Woohoo!  Getting up at 5am EVERYDAY and being at class at 6am and going until about 5pm or longer is tough stuff.  It gets tiring fast.  Thankfully we've got a small class and they're gonna give us Monday off!  Normally we'd have to go for the 20days straight before having anything off.  I miss my friends and family of course and especially my dog! I can't wait to see my dog! I know, sounds stupid, but I love that dog!  At least I'm getting good practice of not having regular internet access while I'm here...since I'll be on the road all the time.  I just ask for continued prayers as I finish up this training and finally get out on the road.  Who knows, maybe I'll be comin' through your town and can pop in for a visit!!  How much fun would that be!!  Aight, I'm gonna go now!  Blessings and peace to all who read this!

      Wow is all I can say....what a whirlwind the last 2wks of my life have been since I began my new temporary career.  WE run hard and fast ALL the TIME.  Never seems to be time to stop and breathe...of course, it won't be like this once I'm in my own truck and doing my own thing. I'll be able to stop regularly and connect to the internet etc...and keep abreast of what's going on in the world.   I've been in EVERY state on the eastern seaboard except FL.  Others include, AL, MS, TN, KY, IN, IL, WI, WV, NH, OH, etc..etc..etc...I think you get the point. in 2 wks of driving I have either stopped or driven through half of the continental United States.  Who knows what's on the agenda for the days to come.  Only 14 more days of having to drive with a trainer.  It's not all that bad, thankfully I ended up with a half decent trainer and we get along well.  My worst nightmare was that I'd end up with some scraggily, smelly old man that smokes 8 packs of Cigs a day!!  But thank God that didn't happen!  As I compose this, I'm sitting in a truck stop in Florence SC preparing to deliver a load to Columbia, SC tomorrow @ 2:30pm.  I'm hoping maybe we'll get to go through Augusta for our next load but I'm not holding my breath.  I must say that we do live in a BEAUTIFUL country.  Driving through the mountains and seeing God's wonderous beauty is awesome!  I've had a lot of time to think so far and the one word that keeps coming back to me is Amazing.  How amazing is our God?  How amazing is HIS love for us?  Words can't even begin to express any of this.  I'll have more and better time to think when I'm driving by myself.   I've thought a lot about things that have happend to me over the last 8 months of my life, the people that have come and gone, the churches that have come and gone, relationships that have come and gone.  I'm currently trying to figure out and discern where I'm headed next.  What does Jeff need to change about his life?  About relationships with people?  How can Jeff be a better person and have better relationships?  Any suggestions are welcomed.  What is it about Jeff that makes Jeff feel like the odd man out all the time?  These are just to name a few.  When I have figred any of this stuff out I'll be sure to let you know!  I've missed being able to communicate regularly with folks.  I'll probably use my cell phone more when I have my own truck becaues I don't want to talk too much and wake up my trainer.  Anyway, if you have my cell number feel free to call me anytime.  Even if it's just to leave a message. It'd be great to hear a familiar voice while out on the open road.  Alrighty, time to stop writing for a bit....gotta hit the restroom etc...and probably go to bed.  There's still much to catch up on in the Youth Specialties world!!  Peace my brothers and sisters.  May the God of love who gave His only son to death on a cross, make his light shine upon you, within you and through you and may his Blessing be with you evermore.

      The wheels keep on movin' friends!  It's been nonstop since I got on the truck Wed afternoon.  We've been on the go so much, I even lost track of what day of the week it is! I can't believe it's Sunday already!  Wed. when I got picked up, we drove to MS to drop a trailer, then drove to International Paper in AL picked up a trailer, delivered that one to just outside of Chicago.  Then went to Indiana picked up a half loaded trailer, drove to Wisconsin arrived at that shipper when they were closed, thanks to the wonderful Chicago traffic!  So we dropped that trailer at a drop yard, went back to another part of Chicago to pick up another trailer full of tools that we have delivered today in Greenville SC.  It's crazy, I've been through Chicago about 4 times in the last 5 days.  And let me tell you, it ain't easy drivin' a truck in the middle of Chicago traffic! DON"T EVER cut off a big truck, we can't stop and we'll run you over!! Just a word of advice.  Right now, I'm sitting at a Pilot Travel Center waiting on the next load to be given to us so i figured I'd steal a few moments to access the net and throw a post up really quick.  Needless to say, I'm pretty tired right now...but not as tired as I thought I might be.  It's not easy trying to sleep when the other guy is driving because you get bounced all over hell and back again!  But if you're dead tired, I think you can sleep through anything!  My turn to drive once we get dispatched for our new load.  Who knows where that might be.  I'll put up a more detailed sequence of events when I have more time.  I've been meaning to actually do some journaling, but it's hard when you are driving down the road etc.   Anyway, hope everyone is well! Feel free to call me anytime if you have the number!  Peace brothers and sisters!
