      Can u believe it? My english teacher actually entered the SINGAPORE IDOL!!!!Man,that was a good joke.For one thing, she is one of the expressionless teachers i've come across.The other time, she scolded the whole class and repeated "i am very angry" (in monotone voice).So, i really couldnt imagine how she sang during the auditions.Jokes aside,maybe she CAN sing........Oh well,so then we asked her to relate how the experience was and i was rather shocked to hear it.Firstly,everyone ought to be auditioned in front of the three judges mentioned but nooooo...
This time round they actually group everyone into different groups and enter different rooms where there are DIFFERENT JUDGES!!!i mean like, are you even guaranteed that those nerdy business-man-look-a-likes know how to judge a singer whether or not they can qualify...pity those who landed in their hands. In my opinion, i seriously don't think that its fair that way. Although there was an overwhelming response from the competition but they still shouldnt dump them to some other people whom they arent familiar with at all....oh well, good luck to all those who got chosen and its really alright for you to lose anyway,it wasnt a competition worth trying out.If the producers or the crew that has anythin got to do with the whole show, i hope you guys know what you're doing because as an outsider, i dont think you're doing it right.If you guess wish to make your stand clearer to the public and give the excuses why you do so and so, forget it!Jus chew on it.BITE IT!!

      Today,i had this session of dissection and boy it was gross. Its disgusting enough the fact that i had to cut open the poor rat, and the smell?? was oh-so-overpowering. Initially i was like thinking that there were not enough rats to go around..u noe,animal rights and everything...and then, the lecturer went like, please keep yer anticipation to yourself,each pair gets one rat..I was like, oh my gosh!!The lecturer was ensuring us that they gave the rat a painless death.so i was like,ok,AT LEAST.And guess wad?They killed the rat by placing it in a jar and pumped carbon dioxide into the jar until the rat dies!!CRUEL!!So then we had to crucify the rat in order to hold it firmly to the tray.I don't dare to even touch it and vedro could even stick the needles into the palms of the rat and went.. "ei!!look!!the rat stole my needle!!" trust him to even make fun of it...sheesh!
  
And as if THAT wasn't enough,we had to open it up and separate all the organs and identify them.eeeeeyyyuueeww!!!yuck!!double yuck! the smell was so grotesque!can u imagine?they killed the rat 4 hours before we touched it..Many of my classmates couldn't take the stench so they kept going outside for FRESH AIR.I almost puked.I was intending of puking in class actually,you noe, add more drama... but since no one else did it, i backed out as i was afraid that people might think im such a weakling.................................. The most funny part about the dissection course was when renuka was supposed to help snip sth and since our rat ended up so bloody,we could hardly see anything,so she ended up cutting the lungs!!!!hahah!!!WE kept laughing and laughing...THen terence came over to "help" us to draw out the small intestine.....GOODNESSGRACIOUSME....he literally stuffed his hands in, wiggled here and there and pulled out a whole junk of organs and carefully seperated the small intestine.He was actually holding this "string" of thingy and we were like "terence, don't squeeze it!!THats the rectum!!" And he was like " NO....u see...THis is the-------" and the shit oozed out on his hands...hahahahahahah!!shit hands!!    
So i guess the dissection course wasnt THat bad afterall..it was gross yet it was a fun experience though.i learnt my lesson, IM NEVER BECOMING A DOCTOR!!NEVER!!!!

      Which Office Moron Are You?
You've been here since the dawn of time itself, old timer, and you've been biding your time with your eye on the boss's job. 

You deserved to have a promotion. You've been here longer than anyone else. Your fingers have become craggy, and you see Excel spreadsheets when you go to sleep at night. More than half your life has been spent at budget meetings, advertising liason sessions, team-building seminars and pub lunches with people you hate. Yet for some reason you've been passed over every time in favour of younger, less competent workers. 

No more. You're at the end of your tether. Where's your gold watch? Where's your acknowledgement? Your raises? When does your time come around? 

Your time is now, hombre.

      argh!!Its haunting me again.I'm having difficulties getting to sleep nowadays so i thought that maybe sleeping in the day is not such a bad idea either. The constructions workers came and proved me wrong. They simply drill away happily early in the morning, and trust me,the noise is simply overbearing and naturally,it rattled my cage.How i wish i could straggle the workers!And as if that wasn't enough.Thai workers are also instructed to give a brand new look to my block of apartments so they are busy dipping the colours everywhere and before you know it,someone is at your window asking you to close it so that their painting work would not be distrupted.Sure its hard work for them ----but where's my privacy rights?

Anyways,as for now, my obsession lies on jap bands. Im rather attracted or should i say addicted to DIR EN GREY.So,since im not able to sleep in peace during the day or at night,i surrendered myself to the realms of music.I think that those perky squealing girls out there who simply adores their stars should start changing their way of judging who to go gaga over and who to condemn.Most of them usually goes for the looks.Haven't they heard of not judging a book by its covers?Are they supporting the stars for their appearance or for their talent in making music?i mean like what's up with that?one thing i know for sure is that in the guy's perspective, if that girl's is not "hot",she's heading for the backdoor.Besides judging their talents from the music they make,i guess you are also able to judge through the lyrics.Lyrics are like their thoughts or views towards different situation or issues in life put in words ..which rhymes....(provided these stars wrote their own lyrics!!)People might be wondering,why do i even bother myself with all this?To be honest,i'm sick to my stomach with all these drama--enough already.Or maybe i'm just outta mi mind due to the lack of sleep.Even if you listen to songs not of your languange understanding,you could at least search for the translation of the song and understand the meaning,instead of simply singin along to it.clueless of what you are singing.Its equivelant to reading a curse in a foreign languange.So,a word of advice,do give not-so-good-looking singers a chance to prove you wrong,with their songs not their looks.They could end up to be your next craze when you least expect it..

       todae i went fer the a.maths lesson n it was not bad la...cos chong was in a good mood. So in the mornin,she actualli wanted to ask mi sth but was at a loss of words,den, of all things to ask...."why is yer hair so wet?"  lyke duh.... I BATHE IN THE MORNING>??? wad a lame question. So then the lesson continued and i was sitting beside aaron n i was browsing tru his images in the handphone..kenny so full of himself,snappin photos of himself. And i was so shocked to see one pic, aaron took of himself,shirtless!!haha!!i was laughing mi guts out not bcos of his bods(which cannot be seen) but cos i tot sumone took it fer him...how wud i noe..HAHA?!?!


den off i went for band practice,not bcos i was supposed to but because i had nothin else to do. Anyway, i wanted to judge the new conductor wif mi own eyes. He is a malay, hu studied n blahblahblah in US. Not bad,he jokes around with us and tell grandmother tales. Funnie thing is, he stayed in the US for almost 5 years and yet he still speaks with the malay-singaporean accent. Besides that, overall, i find him a good choice. So the bands still holds sum hope after all..Den, all of us did punishment for being rude and wadever!, i din even speak a word and yet i had to do it too...wad is the world comin to?

           i feel so sick today.Went to the doctor's and he said that i merely got infected by someone else..darn that idiot.Aniway,today,we had P.E lesson and i felt so bored because we couldn't play floorball.Wandered around aimlessly until finally decided to watch my friends play soccer. Although i really have to admit that i was much of a loser.It was so hot and the game was so boring that i started daydreaming....den suddenly,BUMP..a ball hit my face :(:::The pain was excruciating.I sat down to rest and my head was spinning round and round.My brains felt as if someone was squeezing it with bloody long fingernails!! 

  i was still having the blocked nose so i took a rest in class instead of going to the canteen to buy food. Then my head started getting dizzy and my blocked nose seemed to worsen.I lay down,thinking that it might go away after a nap.When i woke up,my condition worsened further.Little did i expect the watery eyes.So,as i was talking to lionel,my tears keep flowing down my cheeks continuously.He thought that i was&nbsp; crying due to the impact of the ball*(the one that hit me earlier)BUT I WASNT!!I really didn't mean to "cry" in front of him making him feel useless and everything..haha!!So then,i felt so lifeless that i didn't even have enough energy to speak.People had to strain their ears to&nbsp;figure out my whipers.I FELT SO PATHETIC!!!!

           I asked my friends on their opinions about this blog thingy.One of them said that it was dumb----its like showing everyone(practically the whole world) about your thoughts and feelings that are hidden deep within you.Things that you don't even dare to speak of in front of your best friend.That's rather true actually.I mean like a diary is only meant for you to read.Why bother writing it down and then letting everyone see it when you could talk about it in the first place?  
&nbsp;
 That was the case that happened in my school.This girl has a crush on this guy but she is just to shy to say it out.Instead,she wrote all her feelings down--including the times where she felt as if the whole world let her down and that she wanted to end her life soon or sth.They guy found out about the blog and read everything.Now that the guy know how helplessly in love the girl is,i doubt the guy would want to face acceptance.Poor thing(for the girl).Well, the internet is open to everyone and its impossible for the girl to actualli stop the guy from reading her blog...right? 
  &nbsp;
 To me,why the hell i am writing a blog is beacuse i feel insecure keeping a diary at home.I don't wish my family to know how bad my suicidal thoughts can get and everything.Besides,if i write down all about my ill-fated life,other people who are thinking of death might come across my blog and start to think.... "hey,this girl's life is worst that mine....So im not that pathetic afterall..." 
 So, i guess in a way,i'm trying to console others that if you think that you are leading the most horrible life,think again.Look around you and you'll find that you are blessed afterall. 
  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;
     &nbsp;
   Don't think of death as a place where you seek when you're down in sorrows.Think of it as a place where cowards seek when they refuse to face life's ups and downs.....

      Today we had assembly and boy,it was boring.There was this maths quiz going on and all the contestants were like only given a pathetic 5 secs to figure out their answer and all gave shit ans...so,as you can guess, the whole thing was rather draggy and boring.I was utterly upset because i din manage to sit near the 3EA hotie.I don't know what others think of him but i think he deserves all praises till high up in the skies above!!Anyway,last week,i managed to sit rather near to him.So although the show was put up, i wasn't listening to it as i was lost in my own daydream.Oh well..  
Besides that,i find that the class' perspective towards people is rather shallow.Due to the fact that i was supposed to change seats and be at the front,i am seated there all alone.So, not wanting to be bored to death,i merely asked around for people who are willing to sit with me---and onli lionel agreed,phew!fortunately someone was kind enough. So then everyone started talking about us and claiming that we were lovers seated together.BUT ITS NOT TRUE!!!Although i cannot deny that there are feelings involved somewhere somehow but stil....nothin has happened yet so,all you gossipers out there, stop making up stories ya!!!>!>!such pesky creatures.And then,vedro was like making up all these pushy actions to bring me and lionel together.wadda hell..i know lionel is a nice guy and his situation now and everything but theres realli no need to ëncourage" or anything....  
When it was time to go home,i was asking farhanah if she needed my company and she went like..." eh?i tot u got boyfriend?where's he?why never go with him?" i was fuming mad but i refuse to show it.As they say,if u can't stop the critisism,go along with it.So i just smiled and waved goodbye and just walked away...trust her to treat me this way..oh well...tomorrow's another day i'm so not looking forward to it...see ya!

           i am utterly dissapointed sad and angry all at once.Out of the 7 members in my team,only three kept their word of helping out.To think all of them promised me their attendence.Not only that,one of them could actually cheer for the netball games happily instead of helping out.And on top of everything,he could even come to us after all that --smilling away.I was damn pissed off.In the end,the remaining four of us,including me,had to rush all the work like mad.We were so tired but had no choice but to still do it.We stayed in school to finish it till about 7 pm.Besides that, terence also made me mad.First,he went like "i would really really appreciate it if you guys re-do it"  That was the last straw,i could absorb no more of their nonsense.Not only are we rushing it off,we were also unappreciated.So,we went to the teachers and asked them shamlessly for extra cloth for a banner.So,we were given two cloths and a spray can.I guess  inhaled too much of the spray fumes  that my brain went dead.And thats when i start getting overly pissed off and ignore almost everyone.  So,today we had the funfair shit.Vedro and me came early to set up the decorations.Saw jennifer and josie,said good morning and started to set everything up.I am such a pathetic idiotic shithead.No one to help me out.So,we asked jia xian to climb the sink and tie the strings on the railings.Vedro couldn't do it,obviously,due to his mass.And,one person alone tying the strings is also rather troublesome.In the end,me,the short one,had to climb the sink n still tip-toed on the sink ,just to tie the strings.....  Then,during the concert,i came down to the canteen and set up the rest of the decorations alone.So,hidayah saw and offered me help.Thats all.  Now,i feel so sad and betrayed that i simply have no mood for anything at all.I would really like to thank all those people involved in spoilling my mood for me and pissing me off.Thanks you all for filling my mind with nothin else but angry thoughts.Thank you for not helping out and instead,called me names and showing the pissed off face.IM SORRY FOR EVERYTHING.I now know that i am not worthy of your time.It was dumb of me to even ask for your co-operation.IMSORRY WORLD...............................pls,save me on your malice,save me from all these people who are driving me crazy.GRant me an end.......
