       Went out last night for pre-birthday drinks.  We all stayed at the Blue Blazer (a brillant pub in Edinburgh) and drank the night away.  Thanks to all you guys that came.  Had a really good time....

       Went to see Troy last night.  Was abit disappointing.  While the action was up there with the best of them it was too long and the acting weak.  Thumbs up to Peter O'Toole and Eric Bana very good.  Pitt's constantly brooding Achillies got triesome towards the end. But still a reasonably enjoyable experience....

       Shirin is leaving us.  She finished working in the lab yesterday.  So we all went to Marianna's flat for a party.  Much fun was had by all.  Especially the two giggling girls...

       At long last, after much ummming and ahhhing I have bought myself an MP3 player.  In the end I decided to go for a MuVo so I can use it as an USB Hard Drive and keep my Phd thesis on there as well.  Weather has turned again.  This time to glorious sunshine, why is it always nice when you have to work.....

       An old flatmate of mine (Jamie) and his wife (Jacquie) were up in Edinburgh for the weekend.  As the weather continued to be fine we went to the Royal Botanic Gardens.  Jamie revealed his taste for a fine bush.....

       Probably the best thing to ever come out of Heriot-Watt Uni.  Postponed from its usual Jan/Feb slot.  We all made the most of the sun and lounged outside tasting away.  What ever you do never drink Old Jock.  It smells and tastes of Dog food.  Not good at all.  The evening went reasonably well (although my memory is very hazy).  A big thanks to Geoff for getting me home..

       I was pregnant and in a hospital room.  It was blue (I think).  As I was talking to an unknown person I went into labour.  I then proceeded to give birth not by c-section but thourgh my lower intestine......

       Me and my mates were out on the town.  All the gang was there, Geoff, Wes, James, Marianna, Shirin, Zoe and Marsha.  As we wandered home one of the girls was attacked.  And the guy ran off.  Me and the rest of the guys ran after him, eventually chatching him up.  For some reason we decided to forgo the usual justice system and punish him on the spot.  Before I knew what was happening we had pinned him down and Geoff cut his nipples off...........

       After much badgering by Shirin (go to her blog  urlLink here ), I am going to record my bizzare dreams as a blog.  Hopefully, interspersed with some things that make me look abit normal....

       This week is shaping up to be a very sad week.  On Sunday, my flatmate and friend Ina left us.  Returning to Germany for her new job.  Today Shirin will be leaving us.  This weekend Wes leaves.  Its all so unsettling.....

       Went out last night with Shirin, James and Geoff.  We went ten pin bowling and had a great laugh.  Even though we were all playing pretty rubbish.  However, I had a moment of genius when after being extremely crap for the first five frames (I was in last place), I managed to get 3 strikes and a spare to come from behingd and win the game.  Woo Hoo. After bowling we played for awhile on the arcade machines alternately getting shot and driving into walls.  And then the drinking started.  Oh dear.  It started at The Wash and then Negociants and then James' flat.  And it being the last time that we would all be together (for awhile at least) the conversation got reasonably personal.  So we now know that Geoff is the Slut of the group and James is sweet and innocent.  Suffice to say the drinking went on into the wee hours of the morning and I finally got home at 7:00 am.  To make matters worse the builders arrived at 8:30 and I have been in work all day trying to stay awake.  I think and early night is in order....

       At long last another dream.  I was walking down a street when I walked past Micheal Parkinson (a famous chatshow host in Britain).  As I passed him, he started to have a heart attack.  I tried to help and dialed 999.  Only for the phone to go...beep beep beep The number you have dialled has not been recognized.  Eventually I got thourgh to the emergency services by phoning the local police station.  However, the ambulance men then said that the street we were on didn't exist.  And then Micheal died.......

       Work is proceeding very slowly these days in a practical sense.  But at least this means that I can catch up on some other jobs that keep being pushed to one side.  And although it was sunny and that makes you feel crap because you are stuck inside.  It is now pissing it down with rain and now I feel better.  However, this means that play at Wimbeldon will be disrupted today.  You see the problem....

       Wow.  Not a big fan of the old HP but this film was good.  The change of director was abig help I think.  The dialogue didn't seem to be lifted straight from the books like last time.  And the story moved along at a good pace again unlike the last time.  Overall rating ***

       Its been along time since I have done any web pages.  And the standards have changed alot.  But as you can see I have changed the template for my blog and added some links.  nothing major I know but I feel good for it.  the links take you too.. 1. The BBC news website 2. Albino Black Sheep - a website devoted to all those that have to much time on their hands.  I recommend watching the re-enacted by bunnies series. 3. Red vs Blue - an animation made using Halo.  Very funny. 4. The Quicktime Trailer site.  May put some more links up to deserving sites later...

       Why when you are feeling at your worst does everything conspire against you?  Had a meeting with my supervisor which was infuriating.  And then went to do some lab work only to find that the students haven't left me any reagents. AND its to late to go down to stores.  Grrrr.  On top of that I leave home to get to a night out at 7:30 and get there at 8:00.  Only to realise I have miss read the text message.  Nobody was arriving until 8:30.  It would have been okay if it hadn't started to piss it down with rain...

       Its been on weekend of partying.  Started on thursady night with my usual pool match with my flatmate.  At which of cause we consume a fair amount of beer to help us relax.  Then on Friday, Ina dragged me out again (its always her fault by the way) to the Union again for more pool and beer.  On Saturday, went out for Geoff's birthday.  Which dispite my best efforts ment another 3:00 am finish.  And then to round it off a suprise dinner for geoff last night. I was not in the best of moods this morning.  But to make matters worse its Marianna's leaving do tonight.  Perhaps I should just give up....

       I have become the latest victum in the path of maternal Sea Gulls.  Apparently, the Sea gulls are being particularly vicious this year in defending thier territory.  As I found out walking home from work yesterday. They followed me most of the back as well.  Very scary....

       Sorry people.  But I have been in hospital having a pilodal sinus removed.  For those of you that don't know, this is were a hair folicule grows the wrong way round. i.e. pointing inwards instead of out.  So this is my first day back at work.  Of course everything seems to have fallen apart while I was away.  But that is not too surprising.  On better news have upgraded my computer with a new sound card and 5.1 speakers.  Having afew teething troubles with it but aleast i haven't got interference on the sound channel anymore.  I highly recommend getting an external sound card. Mine's a Creative Audigy 2 NX and gives brillant sound quality and the software that comes with it is pretty nifty...

       Yesterday was a gorgeous day.  So nice in fact that I left work early to go to the beach.  Geoff came as well.  When we got to the beach we found it was much windier and was putting a chill in the air.  But the water was warm (ish) and so we stayed.  We threw an aerobie around for awhile but I was up wind of Geoff so it kept being lifted up and thrown in random directions.  I got my own back on him eventually.  Going to a BBQ tonight so hopefully the rather overcast day we are having will clear up.....

       Very short this one.&nbsp; I was walking down a street abd felt hungry.&nbsp; So I took out my mobile phone and started to eat it.&nbsp; I was very particular in the way I eat it (like eating Kit Kats).&nbsp; I nibbled around the outside screen and then bit the microphone off......

       Went bowling last night with Geoff and a few of his freinds from work.  i seem to have got worse at bowling in the last few years.  Even the tarts in the lane next to me did better (and they just lob the ball down the lane).  I di manage to get over 100 each game.  I must admit that the first two games it was only jusy over 100 (both 101).  I did have the best trick of knocking down all the pins save for the back left and then managing to bowl to the back right. grrrr..  But it was fun and stopped me staying in for a day....

       Tried a new beer last night called 'Fursty ferret'.   Its based on a recipe first brewed in Dorset.  And it got its name because its was left outside a pub in casks and the local ferrets tried to get at the beer.  I can see why.  It does smell vaguely like ferret (its not that strong).  It tastes nice though so once you get past the smell you can enjoy it.....

       Have started to write my thesis this week.  It is very strange that this time next year (almost to the day) I may have finished my Phd.  Its a good job that I have started writing now as it takes ages to write a few paragraphs.  The scientific style sucks for writing.  Having been reading lots of theses recently I don't think that it helps to convey information better.  And it makes it harder to write.  However, I am not doing to badly.  Have made a start on the Introduction and a results chapter.  Finding all the gels and sequence alignments I should have done earlier and have to do now.  Ooops.  But have had to stop.  Been writing all day and my brain is starting to melt......

       Geoff was kind enough to lend me some cash so that I could go see Shrek 2 last night.  As with all sequels there is always the worry that it will be worse than the first.  However, this is not the case with Shrek 2.  Littered with nods and winks at other films thourghout the main story does not suffer.And despite being bombarded with adverts for childrens toys opr family cars before hand evryone in the screen laughed along.  If you do go to watch it stay for the end of the credits for the now expected short....

       Have been listening to a song by the band Poets of the Fall. They did the end song to the computer game Max Payne 2. And have samples of their other songs on their website (link on Right). They sound really good...

       Its amazing nothing happens for ages and then everything starts to happen at once.  I have been suffering a period of no food and no money.  But I get paid to tomorrow so that ends soon.  Work has been moving along slowly and then I recieved an email to say some important samples would be arriving this week.  I have been waiting for these around 3 months.  Then I suceed in doing a double transformation and  isolating a clone.  This has taken 2 weeks.  Additionally, I got my first chapter back from my supervisor.  He started our meeting with ' To be honest Simon I thought that this would be crap, but actually its very good '  and I have only got a few corrections to do.  One of which I had already spotted and changed.  Everything is going so well........

       The Darwin building (thats the building I work in) was floating out to sea.  And we were all trying to do our work while wobbling from one side of the corridor to the other.  As we got further out to sea the wobble became more pronounced until the building capsized!
