      Man, what a blast. Today as Jon and I were walking to his car he farted on this girls car. It was the most scientific fart I have ever heard! It resonated perfectly along the metal of her hood, the poo particles dispersing evenly across the blue paint. The fart seemed to breathe life, it was screaming for freedom. "Release me from your asshole Jon, let me be free!" This fart was so amazing Jon should get a flippin' nobel peace prize for innovations in the field of accoustics as less than lethal ant-terror weapons. "Thwipfhagumpbramp" That is the sound of pure genious, or in this&nbsp;afternoons chain of events, the sound Jons anus. W00t W00t!

      Anyone ever heard of Chris Cunningham? He's a world renound director/short film maker, and he made this cool promotional video for an Aphex Twin album (by the way Aphex Twin is really cool). The video is kinda creepy and it is best when you turn your speakers up fairly loud and shut off the lights!  "http://www.drukqs.net/click.html"

      I just had another panic attack, I followed what my mom said to do (she also has panic disorder) and inhaled through the nose and exhaled through the mouth, my heart is still racing. It was scary, that is the 3rd one this week! I really need to see a professional about this, it causes me to worry too much, and that affects my disposition and reactions to seemingly small things, which to me are huge matters.

      Man, I've been listening to Joy Division for a couple years now and I just found out Ian Curtis is dead! And to top it all off, he's been dead for 24 years! "This just in, Jordan gets news really late, what a poop loser, that is all for the news tonight." Damn man, I need to keep up with times.
