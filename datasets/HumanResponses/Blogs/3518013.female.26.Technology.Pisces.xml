      To the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world.   I think that quote sums up the way life is...  Many people can cross my path with not a second thought... But a select few find that they see something in me worth exploring.  Right now for me it has been up and down...  Some wonderful things are happening.  This guy I met I really like he's great in bed but he is a couple years younger than me and I can never tell what he is thinking.  I am not new to the dating scene but every person that I date seems to have some sort of issue.  I'm not going to think to much into it just have fun while it lasts.....  My ex finally called me after we got drunk and well...  you can probably predict the rest.  I'm not into him anymore but I think if you care about someone you call them after a little romp just to let them know they were not just a piece of ass!  I swore that I woulnd't talk to him again when he called but I did.... And it turned out well he would like to go out sometime..  Hope he doesn't think that I'm still into him....  It's weird because the one I am really interested in right now is a neighbor of mine...  He's 20 not even old enough to drink but I want to know about him...  But again a small problem he id friends with the guy I'm sort of seeing...  Bummer rules that one out.  Even if the 5 year age difference didn;t this does.  Then there is the one that is in my heart.....  We had a fling for a few months and when I said that I didn;t want to see him anymore he quickly got a girlfriend.  Now I am forced to work with him on a daily basis...  Never date your boss!!!  Liek uncle cracker says there a memory out there that I can't erase and my memory is him...

      If you always do what you have always done, you will always get what you have always gotten.   I ran across this quote today in my search for a greater meaning in life(lol) I thought that it represented the way I have been feeling lately..     Why do people continue to make the same bad choices they have made in the past?  Is it in our nature.  I truly believe it is....  Today for me is a very good day. I met a very interesting person the other day.  It is truly amazing how many people that I have met that I have no interest in talking with more than a minute and a half.  People that are just empty inside and have no dreams hopes and interest in what life has to offer...  And then there is a select few that you meet and they leave a lasting impression on you.  A soul that seems so intriguing that it seems almost impossible not to want to know them better...

      Just got back from camping and a classic rock concert @ the gorge...  Hard getting back to daily life.  Still wondering what M is thinking and why he hasn't called..  I won't call him.  Not my style!   I'm not even interested in him just feel like a piece of ass..  Life goes on.
