       Editors' meeting went fairly well today. It was productive, at least. I'm still letting myself get weak and giving in to Trevor, though, and Fred called me on it. It just seems easier to let him have his way sometimes, you know? Gotta be strong, Brooke, gotta be strong.       You know what? Family is a beautiful thing. It truly is. If you don't spend time with your family, you are missing out. They have wonderful stories to tell! I helped my aunt move tonight, so I got some quality time in with her and my grandma. I love them so much. My grandma told me about the days when she used to go to TWU, back when they were VERY strict (ever see Mona Lisa Smile? JUST like that! strict curfews, no guys on campus, dresses all the time, etc.). And then my aunt (she's 31) told me about when SHE went to TWU, and you could wear pjs to class and it was co-ed (not that many guys go there), and the guidelines weren't nearly as strict.. it was so interesting! Of course, now I'm exhausted because of all the labor from moving, but it was worth it.

       First post of my new blog! I got tired of Xanga. I like this better, it allows more room for creativity, in my opinion. Then again, who am I to talk about creativity? Kristine did my HTML, lol. (Which I love, btw.. thanks girl!)       Let's see, news: My drivers ed stuff came in the mail today (I've been waiting for it for 8 months now), so I get my permit in a couple of days! Woot! I remember when I was little, and I always imagined getting my permit on the morning of my sixteenth birthday... yeah so much for that, lol. Hey, better late than never, right?      I had a bit of a nervous breakdown last night. It wasn't very pretty, but if you are one of those who I talked to about it, I'd just like to report that things are going more smoothly now. I may be loquacious (SAT word) most of the time, but it's different when I'm with my mom. I can be very blunt, and I let my mouth run away from me. That's something I need to work on. New School Year resolution: be a better daughter.       I guess that's it for me this evening. Ciao.

[future plans]  editors' meeting tomorrow at noon
