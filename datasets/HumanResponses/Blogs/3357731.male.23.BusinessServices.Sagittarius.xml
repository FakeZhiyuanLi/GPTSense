      What a tangled web we weave when first we practice a political and financial clusterfuck. The nasdaq 100 trust, symbol QQQ is comprised of 100 companies that trade on the NASDAQ exchange, the NYSE's little brother. This effectively is a mutual fund for the top 100 Nasdaq companies. Ebay, cisco and many other internet bubble era stocks make up this little time bomb. As usual, the two years prior to an election, the govt does everything within its power to turn any perilous economic tides so their regime can stay in power for another go-round. Here we are, 5 months out and the propoganda machine is in full force "more jobs are being created, the stock market is doing 20% better than a yera ago today". Stocks as a whole are overpriced, the techs and other profitless wonders such as Amazon.com have been flying the last 2 years. Once the election party is over, and booze no longer floweth, our hangover will soon set in. "How do you know this" you're asking. I don't, I have no magic pills or Nostradamian vision, but history is a great predictor of the future. Historically stocks trade at a PRICE/EARNINGS ratio of around 15. Ebay and Cisco are now at 108 and 36 respectively. There are a confluence of other factors that will turn the economic tide in the coming months. The price of oil, interest rates increasing, the successful or unsuccessful detachment from Iraq that is supposed to occur this summer, as well as issues with china are all concerns. My not-so-crystal ball tells me that we can count on at least two of those things increasing in severity and negatively affecting the market. So, stocks are overpriced, shit and fan are soon to meet. I see a few ways to play this. I'll set the time horizon as a year from the election, roughly a year and a half from today. The risky play with a chance for doubling your money would be buying  QQQ puts (options, that win if the stock goes down) with a January 2006 expiration. Enough time to let the shit hit the fan, and enough lag time to bail out of the position if the time doesnt turn after this election. I like the $36 puts, they demand a $4 per share premium, which means you would make a dime until the stocks drops below $32, but glancing at the 2 year chart it seems highly likely. In the year following the previous election, EBays value dropped by half, along with many others that comprise the QQQ play. Better odds than blackjack, and you have the option to pull out if you dont like how the cards are laid out in the next few months. The middle of the road play would be gold stocks. Not cheap today either, but cheap by comparision, and classically they thrive when the Index's fall. I like Goldcorp (my major holding), AEM,and NEM, for stable plays, IAG and GSS for riskier plays. The other obvious option is to warm the bench and watch the action from the sidelines. People often do in down markets because they dont understand how to make money when the market falls. Next blog will explain that.
