      I got my shipment of yarn today in the mail.  The extra stuff I'll need to finish my ruana.  I think I'll probably have leftovers, but I am always paranoid of not having enough to finish my projects.  I have only ever ordered from  urlLink Elann  and I always pleased with their speediness, packaging, and prices.  They always seem to have tons of sales.  I love just browsing - you should take a look, it's rather addicting.  Window shopping for yarn.

      I took a boring old t-shirt and jazzed it up with some beading. This was my crafting project for the day:     And here is a close-up, but it's not very clear...     You get the idea though...

      I was knitting on my ruana today, and I realized that I would need more yarn if I was going to make the whole thing according to the directions, so I logged on to  urlLink Elann  and kept my fingers crossed.  They had enough!  I'm using  urlLink this  in the ebony, stone, and espresso n chocolate.  It's gonna look great.  It's mostly in the ebony.  I wear so much black, it's not funny.  I am thankful they had enough left.  The price was good too.  This yarn is very forgiving, which is good, cause I'm still not an expert knitter or anything, and I drop stitches here and there and never realize it till it's way late.  Thank goodness for bulky yarns.

      Awhile ago I bought yarn for  urlLink this  pattern.  Well, I found out I bought yarn that was MUCH too thin.  So today I began knitting the three scarf ruana from  urlLink this  book.  I am so happy to be knitting and doing something creative. It's moving along nicely.    Today I also purchased urlLink this  book at the bookstore.  I am still not confident enough to do complicated stuff, so I'm ok with easy for a while.

      I need to journal what I've done else I forget  I made a scarf from my knitting book.  Book I:  The Knit Stitch.  It's the horizontal scarf.  I used homespun yarn from Walmart.  Like three different types.  It was a good first project - the yarn is WAY forgiving.  I followed the directions exactly.  Project 2 - I used the Reader's Digest beginning purse sample.  I used the left over black homespun stuff from the scarf.  I used the required needles.  I didn't follow the pattern exactly.  The yarn is forgiving and the stitches don't show up so well.  I ended up not doing the seed stitches on the sides of the back.  The cable was good, but it can't be seen. I sucked at the handles and the lining.  I kind of made my own handles - they're uneven though.  The lining was a disaster.  I used my own stuff and it's all crooked.  Oh well.  It's cute  Project 3 - my own kitting bag,  I used size 6 needles because because I wanted a tight weave.  I used all left over yarn. In fact, the navy yarn is a totally different weight so I didn't use it very much because it was totally different when I used it.

      I am still working on my ruana. Slow but steady.    I heard someone at work say that they thought maybe ponchos were popular nowadays.  Duh!  I interrupted and told her I have tons of cool patterns and plan to make one in the fall.  She seemed a little taken aback. Like, for real??  Yes. I think people and fashion is an interesting combination.  The way people dress says a lot about their character.  I couldn't even *see* her wearing a poncho.  She'll be envious when she sees mine though.  I bet she'll even be jealous of my ruana.  So there.

      Update on my ruana.  The first side is finished.  Here it is slung over my shoulder:     And this is just a bird's eye view:     Lots of knitting!  But good practice for me.

      I received the tea from Harney and sons.  So far, I have only had the vanilla black.  The aroma is great, though the taste isn't overpowering of vanilla.  More like a smooth black tea.  The tea arrived in a fairly speedy fashion.  I'll post when I have a chance to sample the lemony tea.

      I am posting info on my tea purchases.  I first purchased the black sampler from Adagio Teas.  I got a Ceylon, a Yunnan and a Keemun. Very fast delivery.  I also got the single brew pot that comes with it.  I fell in love with the Ceylon.   For my first teaswap I got tea from Teavanna - Order was a little screwy because I ordered two packages of the Lady Earl Gray.  They sent it in one batch.  That's ok, just confusing.  I also ordered tons of tins to send the tea in.  I barely had enough to go around.  Then for my second teaswap - the Valentines one I ordered a caramel creme brulee from Tealuxe - delicious AND their Aphrodisiac tea- Again, I barely had enough to go around.  So, I ended up getting a gift certificate from them for my first order and I bough myself from of the caramel creme brulee and some of their creamy earl gray.    I like the creme brulee the best.  Then for subscribing to a newsletter through Enjoying Tea, they gave me a gift certificate also.  I bought some Keemun - outta this world!  I am finding I like black teas.  For my third springtime swap I bought from Haney and Sons - the Lemony Green Gunpowder and the Vanilla black.

      I received tea from Revolution Tea for our swap that's due on June 10th.   I bought tea bags this time.  Southern Mint decaf and Tropical Green tea.  I have sampled the lemon tea from before and it's yummy.  I have also used it in my iced tea maker.

      Today we had the pleasure of going to a tea room in Augusta, Kansas, called Miss Muzzie's Tea Room:     I found it by going to the tea room  urlLink map  at  urlLink  Teas . Which, by the way, is my favorite online place to tea shop.    We were way early - it was only 9:30 and they didn't open till 10:30 - but the owners were in the building and saw us peeking through the window.  So they actually let us in.  I was so surprised!  This was such a fun place.  This is the main seating area:     Then they had various seating areas throughout this cute little shop, like these:        They also have fun little hats you can put on and wear while you're having a tea party:     They also sell gifts and stuff at the front of the shop:     I bought a  urlLink tea shop mystery  book.  I can't wait to read them all, I think they'll be fun.   I also bought a cute little tea bag holder.  I had a great time and would love to go back and have tea sometime when they're actually open.

      Last night I brewed up some iced tea using a portion of black tea and some lemony gunpowder from  Harney & Sons . So far, out of all my brewing attempts. This is my fave.  I had it once before, but loaded it down with too much of the lemony gunpowder and it was super strong.  But this is much better.  I suppose I could tinker with the proportions a little more.  I do not like sweet tea, so this is a perfect alternative for me.

      I've been experimenting with my iced tea maker recently and I made a lovely mint tea tonight. I'm very pleased. I used two regular jumbo sized tea bags and one bag of mint tea.  This made three quarts and is very yummy. I only wanted a hint of mint, and that's exactly what I got.  I'm pleased.

      I got my summertime tea swap tea in the mail today.  Wonderful teas!  Since it was a summer themed swap, lots of the teas are supposed to be yummy when iced.  There are a lot of peach, lemon, fruity, and green teas. Those types of teas do make me think of summer.  I had a lemony jasmine tea this morning.  My throat has been bothering me, and this was the perfect thing for it.    I have been brewing iced tea with green teas.  I find I like my green iced tea a bit on the strong side.  I made a pitcher earlier and tossed it because it was weak.  This batch is good.  It's made from Revolution Teas' Tropical Green Tea.  I taste mostly green and some light, light, citrus taste.    I will have to be making a new batch soon, and I will probably just reach in and see what I grab.  I drink more iced tea during the summer months.

      Bubble Tea!  I finally had some! There's this Italian restaurant we go to and the last time we were there I noticed a place near it had the word "Tapioca" on a sign.  I ignored it.  This time we drove by, and I saw the place is called "The Bubble Cafe".  So, as soon as we were done with dinner, we went down to check it out.  There was an employee out front smoking.  They had a menu thingy on the front window.  I was reading it, and then asked him if they have Bubble Tea, he nodded and said yes.  Woo-hoo.  We went in and I was so pumped. I had coconut and pineapple.  Kinda like a pina colada actually.  I really loved it!  I will get more the next time we go there. Mark didn't try any -he's pretty picky.  They had fun flavors - I am excited to try some different ones.

       My interest in tea began not too long ago.&nbsp; I guess I'm kind of a newbie to this world.&nbsp; But I love it.&nbsp; I am the kind of person that needs to "learn"&nbsp; all the time.&nbsp; I always thought tea was confusing and difficult to figure out.&nbsp; But when I started swapping tea, I learned so much.&nbsp; Even with the first swap. Since then I have studied and brewed tea from all over the world.&nbsp; I have become addicted.&nbsp; I am proud to say that.&nbsp; I love being proficient in something.&nbsp; This world of tea is still new to me, but I enjoy the challenge and the friendship.     &nbsp;

       While I was in KC visiting my&nbsp; mom we had a chance to visit a nearby tea room.&nbsp; It's called The Main Street Mill Historic Tea Room in Smithvville, MO.&nbsp; It was also a little gift shop.&nbsp; Here are some photos.     &nbsp;                    &nbsp;    We had a good time.&nbsp; The food was wonderful, and their iced raspberry tea was so smooth and refreshing.&nbsp; The service was mighty slow though.&nbsp; They had one waitress working the whole place - when we were there there were probably 9 other tables.&nbsp; But we would go back in a heartbeat.

       My brother and SIL returned from a trip to England recently.&nbsp; They stayed in a few different rooms during their journey.&nbsp; Neither one of them drink much tea, so wherever they went, they would snag some tea bags for me.&nbsp; They said every room they stayed in had tea bags and an electric kettle.&nbsp; I got&nbsp;a nice variety.&nbsp; Some brands I am familiar with, and some I've never heard of.&nbsp; I made a pitcher of iced tea with some of them - very good.&nbsp; Strong, but delish!

      I brewed some tea with my electric iced tea maker. I used Revolution's Southern Mint Tea.  Five bags for three and a half quarts.  I think it's almost a little too minty, but the tea flavor isn't overpowering, so I think I probably got the measurements right.  I have five of those tea bags left, so when I'm done with this pitcher, I'm going to try the same thing only using the cold infusion method.  Then I'll be able to tell exactly what the differences are. I am looking forward to my little experiment.

      I tried some cold-infused iced tea today.  We've been talking about on the teaswap pages.  I tried it with some lemony gunpowder green.  It said use a handful.  I used three.  It still could've been stronger as far as I was concerned.  I've realized I enjoy strong tea, both iced and hot.  If I do this again, which I could, cause it's super east.  I would probably use another handful.

      Since it's summer here - and getting warmer each and every day. It's getting more difficult to even think about hot tea.  I can tolerate it first thing in the morning, or very late at night.  Like after a shower, when the sun is set, and it feels a little cooler outside.  I need to make myself drink more of it.  I know how good it is, I also know how wonderful it makes me feel. I enjoy having a cuppa and smelling the flavors. With all the swap choices, I also love trying to figure out which one I will have next.  I love doing that.  I think I have an idea, then I come across one I want more.  Having choices is part of the fun of the tea swaps.
