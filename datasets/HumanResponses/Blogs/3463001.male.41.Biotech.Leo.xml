      Couldn't sleep last night at all. The image of Nick Berg's severed head was surfing my brain the entire night. As it should have been.  I'm questioning my motives for having watched this horror. At first I thought it was just morbid curiosity, like being revolted by a bad car accident but not being able to look away, but I think it's more than that.  The real underlying motive, I think, was that I was looking for an answer. I was looking for an answer to the question of what happens to us when we die.  I saw the very moment Nick Berg died, but all I can say is that whatever it was that was there which defined Nick as a living person disappeared. Did something of Nick survive death? I don't know.  I suppose this is why we have religion. Someone once said that we invented religion to vanquish death, and I have to agree. We seek an explanation to the ultimate mystery of what frightens us the most. When we die, do we just end, or does something of the dead person survive? That's where religion steps in. But religion is only a theory. It can't be tested. As such, all religion can do is provide some degree of comfort, but in reality it's only a guess. At best.  Why the fascination with death? Simple. I haven't gotten over my mother's own death. Her death--much more horrible than Nick's--forced me to examine my own mortality, and two years later, I still haven't come to any final theory or conclusion. I don't know what's going to happen to me or to the people I love when we die.  I do know that it terrifies me. The idea of ending, of my personality fading into nothingness, is absolutely the worst thing that can happen. And my observations of life and death seem to tell me that that's exactly what happens. Consider it a question of probability, and the highest probability seems to be that when we die, we become nothing. We just end.  If death is inevitable, then the next question which follows is, "How can we lead meaningful lives knowing that we are going to end?" I think the answer for that is that  if  one leads a meaningful life, then when it comes time to die, one can let go honestly and with no regrets. Those who die the hardest are the ones who have wasted their lives. They refuse to let go since they are desperate for a second chance to get it right. Like my mother. She never got her second chance.

      I saw it. The video.   It's every bit as horrible, stupid, and evil as they said it was.  Most of the video is the Head Bad Guy droning on and on about some politico-religious crap. After a few minutes of this you start to think, "Gee, with his mask on and his human features not visible, he looks like a monkey." Finally Head Bad Guy finishes his lunatic ravings, and they all get right to killing.  Several Subordinate Bad Guys grab Nick, throw him face down, and pin his legs to the floor while keeping his shoulders and waist under control. Then one man grabs Nick's hair and pulls the head back, arching it severely to expose the neck. With the neck exposed, Head Bad Guy stands at Nick's right shoulder, then starts  sawing  at Nick's neck with a long blade which looks like a butcher's knife. Sawing, not cutting.  Back and forth Head Bad Guy slowly saws as Nick screams. This goes on for about thirty seconds, but it seems like an eternity.  When you can't take any more and are on the verge of panic as you fully realize that a real human being is dying here, Nick just stops.  You see it. The exact moment of death. Nick just stops. He's no longer an animate object, a person. He is now only an inanimate object like a brick or a table top.  His face is locked in a permanent grimace that almost looks like a laugh. The face is what stays with you. The eyes have become empty. The face looks waxy in that lifeless way where you know that something has gone which used to be there.  The Subordinate Bad Guys clearly see that Nick is dead, so they let go of Nick's body and let Head Bad Guy finish his sawing solo. Head Bad Guy saws and cuts for another thirty seconds like he's carving a Christmas goose and removes the head from the body, lifts it aloft like a prize, and starts cheering. The other Bad Guys start cheering, and then all start dancing and cheering. They're having a really good time.  Most noticeable, though, is that while the head is being waved in front of the camera, the eyes blink. Twice, I think. I don't know if this was an involuntary response or if the head was still partly alive at that point, but it's horrible.  The video ends with all of them whooping it up, celebrating the great victory they just had over the evil Westerners and Jews.  These people aren't human. Watching this clip, when I wasn't almost puking or in shock, I was thinking how animal-like they were. They were nothing more than talking monkeys. Rabid, primitive animals.  And like rabid animals, they need to be put down.  I've been consistently against this war--and I still am--but we need to realize that there truly are some genuinely evil, psychotic people in the world bent on destroying us, and we need to kill them before they kill us.

      Today is busy. Prep day. Tomorrow, Cheryl, my San Diego paramour, flies in to O'Hare for the holiday weekend. Much fun will be had.   Married Chick at work went out of her way to hang out at my cubicle today and make conversation three other times. Just to make sure that I knew she was still around, I suspect. I expected her to swing by and chill at the ol' cube, and so far she's been completely predictable in that and in every other way. If I were interested, the next step would be lunches together, with her slipping into the conversation how her husband is [ insert whatever excuses she needs to give herself permission to fuck around here ]. Then she'll either go forward and have the affair, or back out at the last second once the guilt kicks in. Been there, done that, not interested.   I've decided that I'll be a good little boy since I don't need to get caught up in someone's bad marriage. Plus, she reminds me of Evil Fundie Christian Girl (Rachael), which is a type I devoutly need to avoid. Speaking of which, Rachael, if you ever read this, you vicious, nasty, repressed, bitchy little cunt, I hope you're miserable and unhappy. Which I'm not too concerned about since you are the type of person who's determined to end up as one of those lonely, pathetic, bitter old hags who live alone except for her thirteen cats. Fuck you. Loser. My sole regret is that I didn't gouge out your eyes and skull fuck you as Mark watched.   The nicotine withdrawal is proceeding just swimmingly. The cravings are subsiding, and I'm less of a complete bastard than I was several days ago. Right after I quit, I wanted to burn villages and stomp puppies. Now that the cravings have diminished to a tolerable level, they're more like some ugly little gremlin flicking my ear to get attention. The villages and puppies are safe for now, but Christ I miss tobacco. Nicotine is superb stuff. Bestest drug in the world.    More Chicagoland Observations:   The neighborhood where I live in Evanston is mostly white yuppies in their thirties with children. And unfortunately, said yuppies insist on bringing their whining, sniveling children to the restaurants I frequent.   CHILDREN DO NOT BELONG IN RESTAURANTS.  Children don't really belong anywhere other than inside a locked house or an Asian sweatshop making my clothing and shoes, but they most especially do not belong in restaurants.  The whole point of dining is to enjoy the experience of eating good, well-prepared food. It's one of life's greatest pleasures, savoring food. It's an adult experience. Children cannot appreciate it as they don't have the developed sensory ability nor the sophistication to enjoy good food.  So why do parents insist on bringing their obnoxious yardapes to restaurants? Because they are rude, selfish pricks who have bad marriages and are afraid of being together alone as a couple lest they discover how unhappy their lives truly are.   I can hear the parents whining now. "But we're trying to have quality time with our kids." Quality time? How does ruining a meal qualify as "quality time"? The kids sit there making noise, hating everything they're served, throwing or dropping things, so you'll order them the ten dollar happy meal ensuring that they'll die by fifty of a coronary just to make them shut the fuck up and act in a remotely civilized manner. Explain to me, then, how this is "quality time". You can't.  From all of the other restaurant patrons: we hate your kids. We don't want them there. Go home. It was your choice to procreate. Why should the rest of us have to suffer because you felt it necessary to clone yourself so you would feel that your meaningless life would have some purpose?  Stay at home. When your children are out of college and are civilized, educated, employed adults, then have dinner with them in restaurants.   Chicago Politics:   The Senate race is heating up in Illinois, and two of the twenty-plus candidates running are immersed in controversy.  It seems that Jack Ryan has hired some geek with a video cam to follow his arch-rival Barak Obama around on a daily basis in the hopes of catching Obama doing something illegal/immoral/unethical so Ryan can yell "See?! I told you!" at the opportune political moment.  Some background: Jack Ryan is a rich, tall, pretty white boy who used to be married to Jeri Ryan, the former Voyager Borg Babe and still Severely Fuckable Piece of Ass. She divorced him several years ago, and the divorce proceedings' transcripts were sealed. Reading between the lines, since she was the one who filed for divorce and the transcripts were sealed, it's pretty obvious that either a) he was cheating on her, or b) he treated her like shit. The fact that he could even semi-deliberately blow it with one of the most gorgeous women on the planet is proof that he cannot be trusted to make choices affecting the lives of American citizens. I mean, if you can ruin a sure thing, then how can you represent the country, make laws, and be responsible with our tax dollars?  Barak Obama, on the other hand, has been a major class act throughout the entire ordeal. He so far has refused to get a restraining order against the video stalker, and has said that if you are in the public realm, you are fair game. Good for him. And smart. By taking the honorable route, Obama is showing Ryan to be the slimy, needle-dicked bug-fucker that he truly is.  If I were registered to vote here, I'd be voting for Obama. The man has devoted his entire life to public service, he's intelligent, he's a good orator, and he has a specific agenda rather than the usual bland plan designed to please everyone and accomplish nothing. A rare blend. His weakness: he's black. He's also a liberal.  The liberal name tag isn't as much of a problem as is his melanin content. Illinois is really two states: Chicago, and Not Chicago. Chicago is liberal with a large impoverished black population. Not Chicago is white, rich, conservative, and Republican, and wouldn't vote for a black man if an army of strung-out black crack addicts invaded their perfect little suburban McMansions and held guns to their collective heads.  Fortunately, the liberal vote is fairly solidly behind Obama, and if black voters come out in droves in November (which I hope), Obama gets sent to Washington, and Jack Ryan can go back to making heaping piles of money and fucking starlets.

      Now that I am home and not wasting my company's time, I can expound mightily and with great verve.  To wit, Chicago sucks balls. Why? Because it is flat, it is cold, and it is ugly.  Now I know that my view is  completely  relative, but in comparison, with, say, San Diego--Chicago absolutely comes out sucking balls. Huge, hairy, sweaty ones.  Anyway, this diatribe's genesis comes from me having moved out here from San Diego in March for a job. My dream job. (Ooooh.) The job is fine as jobs go--they pay me money for me to park my ass somewhere I don't want to be like most jobs do--but I miss the desert, I miss the mountains, and I miss the beach. I mean it's paradise, isn't it?  That's why I moved to San Diego in the first damn place. But I left San Diego because I had no choice. It was either move or live in a cardboard box in Balboa Park (well, maybe not quite). Or sell my tight, white ass on the street (uh, no).  But now I am here. In the plains. Chicagoland. For the Dream Job.  Here's the Complete List of Initial Observations...  *Traffic: Horrible. *Sun: There isn't any. *Temp: Arctic in winter, Burma in summer. Shoulder seasons last for a week each. *Women: Fat, ugly, and boring. Way too many jesusheads among them. I'm afraid to leave Cook County as I might be taken for a heretic and stoned to death. *Arts: Very good. Much better than San Diego. *Radio: Also very good. *Outdoors: Fine if you like corn fields and subdivisions, otherwise there is none. It's all either farms or houses. Basically New Jersey with worse weather. *Architecture: Superb. Stunning. Probably the best in the country. *Politics: More liberal than San Diego (thank God), but conservative once you reach the burbs. Whites have the power and money, and blacks have the numbers. Some attempt at de-segregation, but don't see much mixing.  *The Lake: Big. Very big. Sort of impressed, but I miss the California beaches. I want to live on one. *Food: Some creativity, but a lack of good, fresh ingredients. CA produce rocks. *People: Moderately friendly, polite. Most seem pretty middle-of-the-road. Ordinary. The accent is annoying, however. They do weird things with their A's.  That covers it for now, I believe. More to follow later.

      I got this from a friend recently and I felt the need to clarify my stance on rug rats lest I be tarred and feathered by the PTA…    Judging by your blog, which I check out almost daily, you are on a quest for a wife, but your ranting about children might be turning off a great deal of women. If I didn't know you, I'd think you don't want children of your own much less somebody else's children. You know, there are some awesome single moms out there that you might not be able to reach because of it.   Okay, this is the deal: It's not that I hate kids, it’s that I hate bad parents. I take note of parents who have unruly, uncivilized kids, but I also take particular notice of parents who have intelligent, well-behaved, well-adjusted children. They do exist. I've seen them. At least three so far in the past ten years.  Basically what I do is observe parents to see what they're doing right (or wrong) and learn what I can, because if I do ever have children I DON'T WANT TO FUCK THEM UP. Parenting is  the  most important human undertaking on the planet, and I take it very, very seriously. I realize that all parents make mistakes, but I couldn't live with myself if I knew that I had seriously damaged another human being that I supposedly cared about more than my own life.  Lastly, readers of my blog should appreciate the humor in my writing. No one could be as out-fucking-rageous as I am and be totally serious unless he was a drooling psychopath, and I don’t drool. At least not very much. So if any single women (with or without children) who might read my blog don't get or don't like my particular twisted sense of humor, then piss off. We aren't compatible, and you should feel free to move on, marry some fat, boring, loser suburbanite who will be a lousy parent and an even worse lover, and raise fifteen semi-sociopathic children who will give you both nothing but grief. Have a great life and venture forth with my blessing.  Capisce?

      So the “Evil-Doers” kidnapped a Marine, a Pakistani, and three Turks in Iraq over the weekend and have threatened to behead their prisoners unless Coalition Forces (us) release Iraqi prisoners, get out of Iraq, etc. They know we’re not going to do that, so why bother with the decapitations?  Because they like killing people. It’s fun. If it weren’t, they wouldn’t do it, and they certainly wouldn’t dance afterward like they did with Nick Berg. If there weren’t a Jihad, they would find some other pretext to go out and whack people. They like it.  These people are basically animals who have found something fun to do (like chop off people’s heads), and they will continue to chop off people’s heads until it loses its novelty. Then they’ll try something new and more exciting. Maybe a reality show where the kidnapped compete against each other and only the winner gets to live. Quick, call Mark Burnett.  So how should we respond? Well, if we were smart, we would look back to the days of the old Soviet Union and ask ourselves, “What would Lenin do?” Chop off  their  heads, that’s what.  Yup. The old Soviet Union brooked no shit, and if we took a page from the Commie Handbook, we’d capture a few of these Jihadi fuckers, cut their heads off with a ka-bar (for the uninitiated, a ka-bar is a Marine Corps combat knife), film it, and send the film to Al Jazeera who will most likely not air it since they only present material that supports the Jihadis despite their assertions that they are fair and balanced.   These Jihadis live for the blood feud, so I say, “Let’s party!” You want to kill a few of us? Fine. We’ll kill a couple dozen of you. And we’ll film it and send the video to the families of those we’ve killed and SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT, YOU SADISTIC, PSYCHOPATHIC, ANIMAL FUCKS.  In good news, Jack Ryan, Jeri’s ex, has bowed out of the Illinois U.S. Senate race.  Jack’s Republican allies scurried away like cockroaches when the kitchen light is turned on within five seconds after it was disclosed (from the recently released divorce proceedings’ transcripts) that when they were married, Jack tried to get Jeri to fuck and suck him in public at multiple sex clubs.   Personally I don’t see what the problem is. If I were married to Jeri Ryan, I’d want to do her in public, too, since a) it would be fun, and b) I’d want everyone to know without any doubt that Jeri Ryan was mine and I could fuck her any time I want and make her love it.  But the Republicans don’t see it that way. They believe in “traditional” values, which means that they do all the things that the rest of us do until they get caught, after which they are shunned by others who until five minutes ago were their bestest friends. Give me an honest drunk rather than a dishonest teetotaler. Or at least don’t vote Republican.  Still, for whatever the reason, I’m glad that Jack is gone. Jack is a two-faced, lying weasel who is only interested in promoting himself and increasing his personal power. With Jack out of the way, Barak Obama--who is actually qualified to be a U.S. Senator--will undoubtedly win in November unless the Republicans can pull a rabbit out of a hat. Or Obama gets caught on video selling crack to a teenage boy he’s buggering while hitting on a white girl. In other words, not likely. Thank the non-existent deity of your choice.  This weekend my continued nesting phase hit critical, and I had a Nesting Attack. A Nesting Attack is similar to a Cleaning Frenzy, but instead of following Roald around with a dustpan to sweep up dust-bunnies or getting every spot (every single one) off of my bathroom mirror, it meant hanging pictures, arranging furniture, maximizing storage space, organizing, and eyeing that bare spot of wall that needs  something  but you just don’t know what yet.  Why nest? Two reasons. The first is that I want an attractive space that projects the person I am. A place that is comfortable, clean, attractive, sophisticated, and fun. And it's my home, so it's a place I should enjoy, especially as the winter here is eleven months long and lots of time is spent indoors. The second reason is that I am preparing an actual nest for the female I have yet to meet and charm who will come over often and maybe stay for—well, forever. Shit, let’s say it, I want a  wife .  In that regard, yesterday I signed up for eHarmony, which claims to be able to match people (Straight folks only. Evidently if you are gay you aren’t looking to have a meaningful relationship.) based on 29 research-based criteria designed to ensure a long-lasting relationship.   Sounds cool, sounds logical. Then, oops, after you sign up they mention in the FAQ section that it may take up to a year for anyone to show up as “compatible”. A year. Good for them. I have to sit on my thumbs all horny and lonely for up to a year while they scour their database looking for someone who will put up with me. But you at least don't have to pay (subscribe) until suitable someones show up as possible matches, which is reasonable.   Once eHarmony does find matches, though, you pay eHarmony fifty bucks a month (gasp!) if you want to you to contact the potentials. A bit pricey, but if they can find someone compatible, it may be worth it. Until then, though, I’ll surf for chicks the old-fashioned way.  Yesterday was a Chicago Architecture Foundation tour of Evanston. I thought, woo-hoo, I get to see Evanston in-depth. Woo-hoo, the tour was all churches. The tour was of the one area in Evanston where they plopped all the churches back in the day when devout Methodists sought to escape Sodom on Lake Michigan (Chicago) and founded Evanston to ensure that good, white, Protestant, Christian wholesomeness would thrive in the Midwest. With my bad att-ti-tude toward Jesus' followers, I sensed that the probability of me bursting into flames was a little too high given the repeated and lengthy exposure to Christian houses of worship. Thus, I bagged the tour and went to an art festival two blocks away.  The art festival rocked. Good stuff by real artists—at real artist prices. I took the business cards of those I thought were worthy of a future Art Attack and left without dropping huge amounts of cash. Hey, I just ordered a laptop so I can write on the train while commuting to work (I can’t wait to start riding the train and laugh at all the suburbanites sitting in traffic.) With the laptop purchase I have to be a good little boy for the next couple of months. It’s amazing how all those seductive little add-ons that Dell throws at you add up.   Anyway, it’s nice to know that they have real art here in Chicagoland and not solely the type of art festival where it’s mostly folks selling schlocky crap to those without taste. The one and only criticism: it was all couples (No single chicks. Evanston is all married couples or single twenty-somethings.), or worse, couples with children in strollers who take up twenty square feet of space with their kids, their kids’ shit, and the stroller, which apparently has evolved like the SUV into something huge and overly complex.   Just strap the little fuckers on your back like we’ve done as a species for the past one and a half million years. You’ll take up less space, and you’ll bond better with your kid. Taking up all that space in a small area packed with people is RUDE and shows that you are a self-absorbed asshole who doesn’t care about anyone but his or her own self. Just stop it.   [And stay out of my fucking restaurants! Saturday night I was eating my meal at a small café and this Cow comes in with three kids, all out of control, and all making noise. I had to leave since they successfully destroyed the atmosphere that makes me want to go there in the first place. I was almost finished when they came in--with a super-stroller--so walking over to her table and telling her to shut her kids the fuck up wasn’t worth the agida. Upon reflection, I should have gone over there and dumped the backwash of my iced tea on the loudest one’s head, then left.]   [Thought: we need children-free restaurants and cafes. We have smokeless bars, right? Then we should have kid-free restaurants and cafes, or at least times when they can’t come in and bother the rest of us who dine out since it’s something we genuinely enjoy. Hmmm...]  So, after negotiating past the super-sized strollers and drooling over some very fine art, I left the art festival and walked over to Whole Foods Market to purchase my dinner.   The beautiful thing about city life is that you can shop daily for things to eat based on what you want to eat at the time. You don’t have to prepare meals two months in advance because you have to drive your Escalade to the supermarket like you’re Lewis and fucking Clark crossing the continent. As a suburbanite, it takes you three hours to drive to the Huge-Mart, find a parking spot, wait in long lines, drive back, unload the Escalade, and then order Domino’s because you’re too tired and stressed-out to cook.   Nope, as a City Person, you can get a little here, a little there, and then leisurely walk home and fix a feast while gazing adoringly into the eyes of your attractive, intelligent, interesting, sophisticated, well-dressed City Girl/Boy. And that’s what I did, by God. Except for the City Girl/Boy part. You, my gentle and loyal readers, need to help me with that by suggesting female friends and acquaintances who may be compatible with the writer. (A completely shameless plug.)  Last night my meal was Portobello mushrooms sautéed in olive oil, garlic, and onion, and topped with Fontina (Use Mozzarella. Fontina tastes great, but it’s too thin for melting over other food.) Also included was a salad of endive and spinach with a balsamic vinaigrette, a very tasty multi-grain roll, all washed down with a glass of some kick-ass California pinot noir. No lines, no traffic, and no stress. Just complete gastric enjoyment and the pleasure of having prepared it myself. Take  that , suburban zombies.

      Back from Philly where much fun was had. Mostly. I spent the entire weekend surrounded by couples, and I swear if I see one more happy couple gazing lovingly in each other's eyes and engaging in PDA, I'm going to scream.   I think the worst of it was yesterday after I got back into town and went to the Evanston Street Fair. All the attendees at the Street Fair were couples--of course--so trolling for single women was fruitless. But the straw that broke the camel's back was the sight of this one couple composed of a fairly attractive man and a moderately unattractive woman. In general neither were particularly interesting, but what did stand out as noticeable was the vibe that the woman was putting out. She had this "Look at me, I have a boyfriend! Isn't he cute?!" look. I swear. I am not making this up.  Thanks. I really, really need to know you are happy in your new relationship. I am currently dateless with no prospects, but somehow you feel the need to throw the fact that you are in a relationship in my face like a cold, damp, moldy towel. Fuck YOU. Cow. Thanks for the reminder that I AM SINGLE AND HATING IT. Bitch.  Anyway, kvetching aside, the truly important thing about the weekend was the wedding. My sister Linda looked gorgeous, and both she and her new husband Paul seemed very, very happy. I don't think I've seen such a well-matched, compatible couple before. They'll do well, and I wish them both all the best.  I won't go into a description of the wedding since it wouldn't make for interesting reading. It went well, everyone had a good time at the reception, and there were no major problems. Consider that the short version. One thing, though: if at the next wedding you are a single male and they force you to do the "Fertility Dance", run.   In other wedding-related news, my brother Christopher got engaged to his girlfriend Shannon the day before the wedding since obviously no one told him that doing so right before Linda's wedding and stealing her thunder was rude. He gave Shannon a big-ass rock (and it was gorgeous), but they haven't set a date yet since Bush is going to ship his ass to Iraq in the fall. Paul will likely get sent back as well. It would be his second tour. The jury was out in regards to Shannon, but she genuinely seems to love him, and she's brought him out of his shell. I think he provides a stabilizing influence for her, and she's opened him up. It seems to be a good match. I just need to make sure that at their wedding that I am either married or hide in the bathroom when they call for the Fertility Dance.  Saturday night I went into Philly with my friend Lee to see Jason Ricci at Warmdaddy's. I was amazed that a white boy could play Blues harmonica so well. And it was SO nice to be in Philly again. I miss that town. At Warmdaddy's it was all couples--of course--and I had to do my best to ignore the two Pretty People who sat in front of me snuggling and cuddling and doing kissy-face the entire goddamn evening and try to enjoy the music. I mostly succeeded.  Sunday morning was my obligatory visit to my maternal grandmother. I was dreading it the entire weekend, but even that wasn't as bad as I expected. She was only moderately depressed and complained only half of the time I was there. It was almost enjoyable and not altogether unpleasant. Sometimes the Universe surprises you.  On Sunday after saying my good-byes, my dad drove me to Philly International. Some advice: don't fly into Philly International. The lines SUCK, and it takes forever to get through security. I've been in at least a half a dozen airports since 9/11, and Philly is consistently the worst.   The flight home was uneventful except that directly in front of me sat a woman with a one-year-old who cried or made noise the entire flight. Fortunately, right before I was set to drive a pen through the temple of the child to shut her the fuck up, one of the flight attendants, sensing the growing frustration of the passengers, came by and calmed the child since the mother was an idiot and completely clueless as to how to take care of her daughter. Big points for the flight attendant, and ATA airlines has earned my undying respect and future patronage for handling an annoying situation so gracefully. Kudos.  But even though the flight attendant handled the situation brilliantly, it does not change the fact that as well as not belonging in restaurants, CHILDREN DO NOT BELONG ON AIRPLANES. In Asian sweatshops making my designer clothing or picking my avocados, yes, but not in a pressurized, confined space where I cannot escape.   Placing children on aircraft qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment to the rest of us who don't have children. If you consider this fact thoroughly, you'd realize that we didn't need to torture detainees at Abu Ghraib. All we had to do was put them on a trans-continental flight filled with screaming, crying, whining children, and they would have given up every piece of intelligence they had, even if they had to make it up.  Drop bombs? No. Instead, parachute a division-sized compliment of screaming, crying, whining children into the target country and sit back and wait for the imminent unconditional surrender. While most likely a violation of the Geneva Convention, it would still be a bloodless invasion with no collateral material damage if you didn't count the environmental and health hazards caused by thousands of poopy diapers littering the drop zone.  Just a thought.  Lastly, I am going to shamelessly use this forum to pimp myself in order to find a suitable girlfriend. Spread the word far and wide. Preach to the masses. I NEED A GIRLFRIEND. Network, network, network. I shall award a prize to whoever gives me a lead to a woman that culminates in a romance lasting greater than ninety days. No shit. And I can be one creative motherfucker when it comes to awarding prizes.  Me: Intelligent, handsome, fit, good genes, funny, educated, sophisticated, cultured, sexy, successful, interesting, mostly not evil and will treat you well, and great in bed (really).  Her: NORMAL or with little emotional baggage, gorgeous (completely relative), slender (not relative), fertile, intelligent, good sense of humor, educated, liberal, will treat me well, and is NOT A PRACTICING CHRISTIAN. Super-double-extra-special-bonus points if she's Italian or Jewish or likes the outdoors as well as City Girl stuff. If she's a Jewish-Italian granolahead hiker and artist who lives in a loft, I will propose immediately. And yes, there will be a rock.  Hook me up, and I hook you up. Deal?

       urlLink    urlLink     This is Roald. Roald is cute. Roald knows this.  Which is why he gets away with bloody murder. The twelve pound little shit knows how to manipulate me.  Everything is all about him and what  he  wants. He is the most narcissistic, arrogant, aggressive, self-absorbed motherfucker I know other than me. Which is probably why we bonded instantly: we are the same.  That brain teaser led sort of tangentially (certainly not linearly) to the following theory:   Roald is the reincarnation of my grandfather.  Okay, I know this sounds flaky, but bear with me...I had this sense of "recognition" that I  know  Roald. As in before I met him. Like I've known him forever. Maybe the "recognition" wasn't solely due to us being similar in personality.  After pondering this a spell, I was lead to the following thought:  If this is true, then what the fuck did Grandpop do to get sent back as a  cat ?  Grandpop was a bit of a rogue (like yours truly), and he cheated on my grandmother constantly (if you knew her you'd know why), but he didn't do anything to deserve being sent back as a cat. That I know of.  It makes you think. Me, anyway.  So I ditched the Blues Fest due to my own personal laziness (Bad, Dave! Bad!), but I did manage to avoid having to go on the road and fight my way through horrible suburban traffic (Hah!). I took the L uptown and did all my errands. Took the L, walked, schlepped bags...Christ on a Fucking Crutch it was great to be a City Boy.   I also had an epiphany whilst on my quick haj: There are some gorgeous chicks here after all.  City chicks.  Cool city chicks.  No shit. They were everywhere. They were practically seeping from the walls as I walked down Chicago Avenue. And many with that desperate I-don't-have-a-boyfriend look.   It made me feel like I  was one of those murdering Islamists after taking out the World Trade Center, being sent to Paradise, and getting pimped 97 virgins to use for my personal pleasure. (Thanks, Allah!)  They were everywhere. Fucking everywhere.  And me so horny.  I was so surprised and shocked I couldn't deal. I scampered on home totally mind-fucked. This has exceeded all expectations.  But at least I think I understand why I haven't seen them until now: they've been inside hiding from Old Man Winter.   Now that the glaciers have thawed, they're coming out from their expensive post-Pleistocene caves to seek the warmth of the sun and engage in the summer mating ritual. How cool.  It seems the Charmed One's life is back. (Thanks, Allah!)

      Once again it's gray and rainy in Chicagoland, and I am wondering when I'll see the sun again. The last time I remember seeing my favorite ball of burning hydrogen was a week ago.   The weather here is as schizophrenic as a Fundie Christian hooker. It doesn't know what it is, what it wants, or what it's doing. It's summer--sort of--and it' spring--maybe. Two days ago it was ninety degrees, today it's in the sixties.   Just make a fucking decision already. Christ.  This weekend is the Chicago Blues Festival, and if I have time tomorrow after spending the day driving twelve hours in Suburban Hell to do an hour's worth of errands, I'll take the L into the city and go see some smoking Blues.  Since there's virtually no open outdoor space for me to play in, and since the women here are for the most part fat, boring, ugly cows, what's left for me to enjoy is culture, and Chicagoland has that in cute, wiggly abundance. Especially during the summer. Every weekend there's  something  going on, and by god I'm gonna enjoy it.  Got an email from Denise last night confirming that she's going to attend my sister's wedding with me next weekend as my escort. I replied and asked her to wear something short and low cut. She, of course, did not reply to my sexualized comment as she's learned to not take the bait when I intentionally say something either sexual or irreligious to get a rise out of her. Smart girl. I did promise, however, to be a good little boy and not ravish her hot, gorgeous, yummy little body, and I will be a man of my word. The price would be too high.  If anyone knows a Christian Cult De-Programmer, please let me know so I can send one to knock on Denise's door. I'd pay anything if I could turn her from a Virgin Mary wannabe into an agnostic slut. I'll supply the tranquilizer darts and duct tape, if necessary. References and bonding required.

      A note on the current Rotating Annoyance, which leads to  urlLink Recreational Equipment Incorporated  (REI)...  I decided to post REI as an annoyance because REI has lost its way and is on the road to eternal commercial damnation. Why? Because they  used  to be a co-op, but they are now only a commercial operation that dresses itself in the trappings of a co-op.  I worked for REI (for those who don’t know, they sell camping stuff) part-time while I was living in San Diego and looking for a real job. Condemned to Clothing and Footwear, I was a salesperson who among other demeaning tasks like zipping up jackets and putting shoes on people’s stinky feet, whored myself by selling REI memberships.  This is how it works: Every REI salesperson is required to sell REI co-op memberships. Technically, REI is a co-operative, and as such is owned by its members. The more members, the more money they have available to improve the customer experience for their members. Sounds good, right? In theory, yes, but every sales drone has a  quota  of memberships to sell each week, and the number of memberships sold determines your yearly bonus and pay. Also, the number of memberships sold by each salesperson is posted publicly for the rest of your co-workers to see.  REI says that it is a co-op with a co-op culture, but when you throw a quota on top of your regular job responsibilities, uh, I’m sorry, but you’ve become just another retail chain.  And that’s fine. If you want to be a regular retail chain, more power to you, but if you do, then a) say so; don’t hide behind the co-op culture, and b) PAY ME A FUCKING COMMISSION.  REI doesn’t do that. Instead, there are lots of rah-rah, feel-good speeches from the managers about how many memberships we’ve sold and how great we all are. Fuck that. Atta-boys don’t pay my rent. Pay me a living wage and give me real bonuses and a clear career path. The fact that I could have made a lot more schlepping boxes at FedEx is shameful when you factor in that we were all hired by REI because of our specialized product knowledge. We were experts.  Because of this, I will no longer shop at REI. I will go to REI to check out the merchandise, then go order it from  urlLink Campmor  at a lower price like everyone else. If I’m going to give someone my money, I’d rather give it to someone who is direct about being a whore than to someone who pretends to be chaste.

      I decided to submit my blog to about fourteen thousand different blog search engines. Shameless self-promotion, yes, but then I am indeed a black-hearted whore. Had I been born three hundred years ago, I would have been a pirate. Besides, I’ve always wanted to say “Har! Avast, Ye scurvy dog, this ship be mine!” and have it be an accepted form of normal conversation. You can use this phrase today, of course, but it doesn’t have the same impact as it did on the deck of a wooden fighting ship three centuries ago.  In the effort to jump-start my quest to form a new harem, I’ve joined a couple of personals sites. I DETEST the personals, but the personals can be a good tool if you look at it as an exercise in statistical sampling and maximizing the probability of generating a favorable outcome, i.e., the more contacts you make, the greater the chance of getting your dick wet.  The first one is a normal, garden-variety site, and so far most of the women on the site are both unattractive and uninteresting. Lots of middle-of-the-road, late-thirties, breeder cows looking to get married, buy a house in the burbs, and drive a minivan filled with drooling, whining yard-apes to soccer practice. Not fucking interested.   So I joined another site used by adults looking for sex partners, thinking that this was a more honest and direct approach, and again I looked at it as an exercise in statistical sampling and probability maximization. The women there seemed both interesting and attractive. On the surface, anyway. It turns out that most of the women on this personals web site run their own pay sex sites, and they use the personals to scrape the email addresses of horny guys so they can spam said horny guys ( moi ) with info on their site, or sell the email addresses to other spammers. Very clever and slimy, and proof that women are just as deceptive and disgusting as men in spite of their feeble assertions of moral superiority. (Note to self: If it sounds too good to be true, it is.) It seems that the only way to troll for chicks is the good old-fashioned way: ask them out and risk being completely humiliated, every man’s greatest fear other than being kicked in the balls.  Reagan is still dead and is being deified in Washington by the Republican Party Faithful. Tomorrow they ship the Gipper’s body back to California for burial. No one is saying shit about how he fucked up the country and trashed the economy, as well as laid the groundwork for the terrorist attacks that have plagued us for twenty years. Why? Because we need heroes right now. We have a coke-addled religious lunatic in the White House, a quagmire in the Middle East, and we’re bracing ourselves for more attacks. Things suck, and we need something positive to look forward to or up to. And Ronny is just the ticket. Look forward to St. Ronny’s face being on a coin or on the side of Mt. Rushmore some time soon.

      Lately I’ve been wondering what my cat thinks. And no, it’s not one of those drug-induced mental migrations leading nowhere other than to a soon-to-be empty bag of Doritos and a nap. I really wonder what he thinks and how he feels.  Roald seems happier than he’s ever been since he arrived in Chicagoland. He has a humongous apartment where he can suspend the rules of civilized behavior and tear-ass around like a maniac, he has lots of windows, and he has much more to look at as there are deciduous trees in the front of the building positively drooping from the weight of birdies and squirrels. In San Diego he had none of these things. (Palm trees don’t support much wildlife, it seems.)  He also loves his new neighborhood. I’ve started walking him again. (On a leash, and yes, it looks gay, but I don’t care. I don’t want to let him out by himself and end up as a road pizza.) I’ll take him outside for his walk, and after grazing on grass with the detached laziness of a cow, he’ll explore the outdoor environs of the apartment building, or he’ll floompf himself on the grass and observe his domain like a lion on the African savannah after a hearty meal of wildebeest.  Observing him at home and on his outings, I've learned the following about Roald:  ·	His name for me is “The One Who Takes Care of Me”. ·	He’s a great chick magnet. ·	He has a thin veneer of civility, which he randomly suspends from time to time to become a vicious, evil, wild beast. And he likes it. It’s his version of being a sociopath. Roald has no remorse, and he has a flexible sense of morality. Guilt is not in his vocabulary, nor is regret. He is the archetype of the Nietzschean Ubermensch. I admire him. ·	Everything is all about him. ·	He is a permanent three-year-old. ·	He genuinely likes me, but he wishes I spent more time with him and played with him more. ·	He is an infallible barometer of human females. In every case where he didn’t like a particular female, she turned out to be a fucked up waste of time or a psycho. I need to listen to his opinion more. It would save me a lot of grief. ·	His life revolves around sleep, play, and food. That’s it, and that’s all he cares about. ·	His favorite food is pork. He also likes meatballs. ·	Catnip has no effect on him. ·	He knows how to be cute, and he deliberately uses his cuteness to get what he wants. ·	He doesn’t like being picked up for hug therapy, but he tolerates it since he knows I require it. ·	His vocabulary consists of one word, “hey”, but there are infinite tonal shades of “hey”. Depending on the tone, “hey” can mean “Hello”, “I want food”, “I want to play”, “I want attention”, or a million other things. ·	I am not his owner. We are buds. But I am the senior bud. ·	He hates dogs. They scare him. He especially hates the bitchy little faggot Yorkie who lives upstairs with the constant “Yip-yip-yip”. ·	He doesn’t like other cats, but it’s more disdain than actual hatred. Kind of like the way that the French look down on Americans. I’ve decided that Dogs are Australian, and cats are French. Or snooty northern Italians. ·	He doesn’t like me talking on the telephone. My guess is that when he sees me talking to an inanimate object, he figures that I’m going insane and will no longer be able to take care of him. That’s my guess, anyway. ·	He doesn’t like watching me have sex. I’ve had other cats that were voyeurs, but he isn’t one of them. He did hang out on the bed for a spell a couple of weeks ago when Cheryl and I were making the beast with two backs, but he took off after a few minutes, almost as if he was wondering what the big deal was and left out of boredom. Or maybe Cheryl and I were just making too much noise. Dunno.  This is what I understand about Roald, but I also know I have a lot more to learn. He’s a complex critter, and he definitely has a distinct personality. And he’s fun. That’s the most important thing. He's a good fellow.

      This is the short list of women I want to fuck. Why supply such a list? Two reasons. The first is that I’m bored. The second is that I am extremely horny right now. Cheryl’s back in San Diego, and I’m left with an empty sex swing (Get one. They're awesome.) and no one waiting in the wings to fill it. While the summer looks busy, I’m sort of anticipating a temporary dry spell until I form a new harem. Or meet someone I actually care about and with whom I want to have a [ relationship ].   Anyway, here’s the list…    Actresses I Want to Fuck:    · Dana Delany. I would crawl through a mile of broken glass just to have her spit on my head.  · Alice Krige. The Borg Queen. Stunning and regal.  · Jeri Ryan. Best tits on the planet.  · Jolene Blalock. Amazing body, and has great DSL (Dick-Sucking Lips).  · Lauren Ambrose. The “Six Feet Under” chick on HBO. DSL, the most beautiful skin of any woman I’ve ever seen, and she has that gorgeous red hair that I want sweeping across my chest as she's riding me like a wild woman.  · Christina Ricci. You just know she’s the type of woman you can do anything to and she’d love it.  · Annette Bening. Before she married Warren Beatty and procreated with him, the thought of which makes me want to yack. Like Alice Krige, Annette is regal and sophisticated, but in a less formal way. Has a smile that can melt glaciers.  ·  urlLink Julie Cox . British actress who played Irulan on The SciFi Channel's production of Frank Herbert's  Dune . Female perfection. Does not pass Go and instead goes directly to the pantheon of goddesses who are devoutly worshipped with incense, food, and libations of red wine. Oooh.   (And here she is, the Goddess. All bow your heads and pay homage. Julie Cox...)       Porn Stars I Want to Fuck:    · Christine Young. French-Canadian porn star. Cute, young, sexy, perky, and loves her work. A screamer.  · Jewel De’Nyle. Dumb name, but a VERY dirty girl. Also a screamer. (I like screamers.)  · Azlea Antistia. Absolutely one of the most beautiful women on the planet. Looks like a young Liz Taylor. Not a screamer, but she’s so beautiful you don’t care.    Best Women I’ve Fucked:    · The Russian Love Goddess (You know who you are)  · Lisa  · Cheryl  · Maria    Worst Women I’ve Fucked:    · Renee. Butter Face (“Great body, but her face…”)  · Trish. Cunt. I still hate her, and it’s been twenty years.    Women I Wish I Had Fucked:    · Rachael. The sex would have been terrible since she is  the  most psychologically damaged woman I’ve ever met, but she was just so fucking gorgeous. Rachael is&nbsp;one of the two reasons&nbsp;why I hate Jesus. Fuck you, Jesus.  · Angela. I was married at the time, so nothing happened. Which is too bad, because the sex would have been mythic. She wanted me as much as I wanted her. Petite with huge tracts of land. Which seems to be the theme with me. (Lynn also was petite with major yabboes, but Lynn didn’t make the best or worst fuck list since she was neither the best nor the worst. She was kind of average as a sex partner. The median with a 95% degree of confidence.)  · Rebecca. A self-absorbed bitch, but an amazing body. She only went out with me to compete with Renee. Rebecca lost interest as soon as she thought that she had beaten Renee. Little did Rebecca know that the very next week after dating her I was plowing Renee, so in fact, Renee won.  · Alais. My former massage therapist in PA. Married and a Jehovah’s Witness (I know. What is it with me and Christian chicks?). She was gorgeous in a girl-next-door sort of way and a genuinely good human being without being boring. Only one of about five women on the planet who are nice without being a fat, boring cow. I swear I would have married her had she been available and not been a member of the God Squad.   Yes, I am a pig. So what? At least I am honest, and I am without Bullshit. Better an honest pig than a dishonest lamb.

      Last night as I was reviewing my blog, I noticed that my post “Whores for Oil” had a comment. Curious, I clicked on the link, and there was a comment by Farhan Ali, a Pakistani Muslim. Farhan left a brief message and included a link to his own blog where he had written a post himself regarding problems in the Muslim world. The link to this post on his blog is here:   urlLink Re: Whores for Oil .  Go there. Read it. It’s enlightening.  Most of the information we get in America is fairly filtered by the corporate media, but Farhan’s post is a first-person account from someone who lives in the Muslim world and who is directly affected by what we only see remotely on television. Plus he’s just a regular guy without a political axe to grind, and that makes his thoughts even more valuable.  His comments lead me to think of my own experiences in the Muslim world.   I served as a Marine in the Multi-National Peacekeeping Force in Beirut, Lebanon in 1982-83. In October of 1982, I arrived in Beirut in the back of an amphibious tractor, which is basically a floating armored personnel carrier which doubles as a vomitorium in choppy seas.   On the second day after arrival, we were greeted with a mushroom cloud caused by the explosion of a rigged Mercedes Benz that someone had detonated near an Israeli Defense Force checkpoint along the coastal highway. Welcome to Beirut.  After digging in and setting up a routine of sorts, we started patrolling the surrounding area made up of small towns of Lebanese Muslims. The goal of these patrols was to let people see us and to hopefully act as a deterrent to the sectarian violence that largely kept the populace locked inside their houses to avoid getting killed by the militia du jour.  I won’t go into the politics of why we were there (that’s another story) since the point I want to make is about those people there who lived their lives in fear.  They were about as alien to me as it’s possible to be. Their language, their dress, their customs, and their religion couldn’t be more different from my own. They might as well have been from Planet 10 across the 8th Dimension. Or from Arkansas. But while I noticed the differences, the similarities were even more striking to me.  This is what I discovered:  They want the same things we do.  They want to raise their families, they want jobs to provide for their kids, and they want to be LEFT THE HELL ALONE to live their lives in peace in their own way.  This sounds pretty self-evident if not mundane, but it’s not. If it were, there wouldn’t be conflict anywhere on the planet.  The problem isn’t religion, or culture, or politics. The problem is economics. Essentially, all warfare and conflict is ultimately about the control of natural resources. There are no exceptions to this theory. Human populations are governed by the same set of rules that govern every other living thing on the planet. Resources themselves are all about survival, and he who controls the resources needed to survive stands the best chance of surviving and thriving.  When people have access to adequate resources, there is no conflict. When there isn’t, there is conflict. Simple.  So what’s the answer? There isn’t one. As long as we live on a rock floating in space, which by definition has a finite pool of resources, and we have fluctuating populations all competing for these resources, we will have conflict. The economist Thomas Malthus penned this exact theory two centuries ago, and it is still as valid today as it was in the 18th century.  We may not like it, but until we accept it as a reality, things can never change.

      Body workers say that people store emotions in their bodies, sometimes for years, and that when the body is ready to release, these emotions are released as well. Last night I experienced this.  Kimberly, my massage therapist, doesn’t look like your typical crunchy granolahead massage maven. If you saw her on the street, your first guess would be that she’s a waitress at a diner in Jersey (“You want coffee with that, Hon?”). She’s kinda tough, crusty, and carries herself like a New Yorker, but she’s proof that looks can be deceiving.  I’ve been working with her for a few weeks to unknot the mess that is my upper back. Kimberly uses multiple techniques in a session including deep tissue, myofacial, and Reiki, but her natural gift is an intuitive sense of how to get muscle fibers to release. With each session, I progressively feel the muscles melt and give up their tension. Last night was no exception.  Kimberly spent almost the entire session working on my upper back, and as I was getting even more release than I usually do, I asked her to continue on the upper back and ignore the rest. She was happy to do so, worked on that area exclusively, and almost at the end of the session, my upper back released completely.  So what’s the big deal? The big deal is that when my back finally gave up holding the tension it felt like I was being born. The first sensation was that I had instantly lost forty pounds of shit. I felt lighter, happier, and more awake and aware than I’ve ever been in my entire life, and I realized that this was the first time I can remember not feeling tension and muscle spasm. I had been holding on to this pain my entire life. I was storing it in my body.  I’m not sure what emotions were released, but my first impression was that it I was storing a bottomless well of fear and mistrust, a perpetual sense of waiting for something bad to happen. With that burden gone, I thanked Kimberly profusely, and walked out of her office glowing like a newly born sun.  As I walked home, colors were more vibrant, images were clearer and crisper, and sounds and smells were more acute. The closest analogy is the feeling one has after skydiving. It’s that sense of how wonderful it is to be alive. Adrenaline-driven Enlightenment.  The second thing I noticed walking home was my own attitude. I felt self-confident, focused, and whole. I felt like I was my true self without all the crap that has held me back my entire life. The core human being was at the helm instead of an accretion of shit that was not me.  New Age woo-woo philosophy? Maybe. But I don’t care what the actual explanation is. What I care about are results, and the results from last night’s session were truly amazing. I feel fearless, confident, and in complete control of my life. It’s very good to be me right now.

      Twelve days without tobacco. The cravings are starting to subside, and more importantly, I am developing a routine  without  tobacco. Good for me. Tobacco has killed three family members. I don’t want to be the fourth, especially as there are things I want to do before I exit the planet.   Like write a novel.   Paddle the Inside Passage from Vancouver to Glacier Bay.   And live in a Craftsman bungalow (or a city loft?) with my cat and maybe a new wife and a yardape or two (who will not eat in restaurants).   Lately I’ve been “nesting”. I’ve become interested in design, cooking, and real estate. Either I’m gay, or I’m getting ready to snag a woman and settle down.   Strange. Since the divorce, I’ve staunchly avoided complication and commitment. Who’d a thunk it that Dave George the Boyishly Charming Yet Manly Sex God would ever want to settle down again.   Today is yet another gray, cloudy, icky day. Yesterday morning was glorious. The sun rose over Lake Michigan, almost in that California “Hi! How are you?!” sort of way, but it was quickly snuffed out by a gloomy, brooding sky. It’s almost as if Chicagoland is determined that everyone be miserable. I don’t know how I’m going to survive the winter unless I get a full-spectrum sun lamp and bake under it regularly.   Two weeks from now I’ll be back in Delaware to see my sister get married. This is a good thing. Her fiancé, Paul, is a great guy, and he treats her well. It will be wonderful to see her move on to the next stage in her life. I have no doubt that they will have a good marriage.

      A successful weekend in spite of Chicagoland's concerted attempt to piss me off by raining the entire holiday weekend.  Monday, though, the weather gave us a wee break, and Cheryl and I went to the Art Institute of Chicago. Wonderful. It's a real museum in the way that New York museums are real museums. I was very impressed with their collection of Native American and African art, and the collection of Ancient art is not too shabby, either. If you visit the museum, hit one floor and tour it thoroughly. It's too big to see in one day.   So yesterday the Arabs bombed their own in Saudi Arabia. Supposedly everyone's favorite terrorist group Al Queda claimed responsibility, and said that they bombed the Saudi oil facilities to attack "American companies...that are specialized in oil and steal the wealth of Muslims."   Steal the wealth of Muslims? Yeah. Well, Rag Boy, if it weren't for us infidel crusaders and our addiction to oil, you and your camel-humping brethren would still be living in tents rather than having millions in disposable income which you can use to bomb oil facilities, behead do-gooders, or go to titty bars. (The 9/11 hijackers used to hang out in nudie bars in Florida before they got raptured up to Paradise. Research, I guess, so that they'd know what to do with all the virgins Allah was going to send their way for taking out the World Trade Center. Allah, it seems, is some sort of Cosmic Pimp.)  The result of the latest unpleasantness from the worst place on Earth is that the oil market is having an epileptic seizure. Oil is over $42 a barrel.  You know what? Good. I'm glad oil is now more expensive than NFL tickets. Why? Because maybe we'll finally get pissed and start using our resources to develop alternative sources of energy so we can tell the Arabs to suck our balls. And then finally we can get out of the Middle East and let them kill each other to their little hearts' content. Get out and let them be.   But will we take the long-term view and wean ourselves from petroleum? Not any time in the not-too-distant future. Bush's ties to the oil industry preclude that. His administration has offered  nothing  in the way of energy policy except the push to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve. Don't expect any changes should Dubya be re-elected come November.  In Old Cokehead's defense, though, it's not totally his fault. It was Reagan who gutted the budget for alternative energy research, and the program hasn't been re-funded since. No one--including the Democratic administration of Clinton--has done anything to deal with the problem of our dependence on oil and our willingness to send Americans to die to feed our perverse thirst for oil.  That's why I jump for joy when the pump ratchets up a tenth of a penny after a tenth of a penny. As a nation, we only take action when we are facing an imminent threat. Like Pearl Harbor. Or when those pesky Southerners wanted to take their ball and go home back in 1861.   When someone or something has us by the short-and-curlies, we look down, look up again, smile, and then proceed to smoke them and their kids, dogs, and houses off the face of the fucking planet.  I think it's time for our Jihad. Our Crusade. Yes, a Crusade. Just like in the 13th century. But it won't be a Christian Crusade. It will be a cultural crusade of the civilized against the uncivilized. The superior against the inferior.  How will we fight this Crusade? By pouring billions into research, developing alternative sources of energy that are clean and efficient, sharing those technologies with the world--and then ignoring the Middle East.  Ignore them.   Give the Islamists what they want.   They won't be able to deal with it, and they'll turn on themselves, since without us to hate, they'll start hating each other.  And as they slaughter one another, we can sit back all fat and happy and go "nyah-nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah" while we drive our flying cold-fusion cars to work and have extra cash to spend on education and for lap dances in Florida titty bars.

      I can’t sleep.  Four weeks now. A month. I haven’t slept more than two hours a night in a month.  Chamomile, melatonin, l-tryptophan, meditation, yoga, warm baths…nothing works.  Acid Reflux? That’s part of the reason, I think, but I’m treating that and watching my diet carefully. Stress? What stress? Life is technically pretty good. Most people would kill to be me.  So why can’t I sleep?  Because I don’t fucking want to.  Sleep is the enemy. Sleep is a thief. Sleep steals life from me.  Time that I could be spending writing, or reading, or fucking I have to spend in a self-induced coma.  Sleep is wasted time.  So I choose to not sleep. I refuse to sleep. Sleep can kiss my ass.  Unfortunately, Sleep is fighting back. Sleep leeches away my energy so I can’t focus on anything that requires my attention for more than 45 seconds. Sleep wraps my tongue with gauze so my words come out heavy and slurred. Sleep makes my eyes feel like swollen, rotten grapes waiting to explode.  Sleep is kicking my ass.  Fuck you, Sleep.  Sleep will eventually win. Sleep always wins. Sleep does not accept an armistice, or a truce, or a treaty. Sleep must have its way as it always has to have its way. Sleep is an arrogant, raging three-year-old carrying a Benelli combat 12-gauge. You do not fuck with sleep.  I hate Sleep. Sleep hates me. We are bitter enemies, locked in a death-struggle. Winner takes all. Sleep isn’t sweating it. He knows he’ll win. But I’m still going to fight. He may conquer me, but he will never defeat me.  Last night before I went to bed to not sleep, I had my phone date with Sharon, the eHarmony civil rights lawyer with the great sense of humor. And I found out to my chagrin that Sharon’s humor is solely paper-based. It had to be one of THE most painful conversations I’ve ever had with a woman. If she were any more uptight, I could have harnessed the kinetic energy and used it to launch a projectile with enough explosive force to take out the Hubble telescope in high orbit. Ultra-serious, could only talk about politics, nervous, defensive, and so repressed that even the Puritans would have thought she was a cold fish.  I ended it after thirty-five excruciating minutes, as the only other option was to hang myself from my overhead fan. I had Roald to consider, so suicide wasn’t a practical alternative. Comforting, but not practical. Problem: How do you  gracefully  tell a woman that you had a shitty time talking with her, that you think she needs to take mood-altering pharmaceuticals, and that you never, ever, ever want to meet her? Answer: You can’t. So you stupidly say, “Would you like to meet?” hoping— praying —that she will say no.  Thankfully, the Gods that watch over me with amused benevolence heard my plea, and she said “no”. Sort of. She’s been on one or two dates with this guy she met, and even though I got the sense that she didn’t have a particularly good time with him, she’s evidently incapable of multi-tasking and seeing more than one man at a time. THANK GOD. Her inability to wrap her head around the concept of dating was my salvation. She asked me for my phone number, I gave it, and she said she might call. Unfortunately, I wasn’t quick enough to give her the phone number for the suicide crisis hotline and instead gave her my real one, but that’s why we have answering machines: to screen calls.  Fortunately, Cheryl arrives today from San Diego to salve my dating wounds and to ravish my sex-deprived body. Cheryl is  not  repressed, nor does she need to take mood-altering pharmaceuticals, and the Puritans probably would have stitched a scarlet “A” to her dress or tried her as a witch as she’s a dirty girl and practices homeopathy and yoga. Cheryl is half saint, half whore. Which is how all women should be.  And with her lying next to me this weekend, I’ll probably sleep.

      I had my first date with Audrey last night at a coffee house called “Kopi” in the Andersonville neighborhood in Chicago. A cool, funky place in a cool, funky neighborhood. Chicago is filled with such places, and I’m really enjoying exploring this city. The date itself went very well. She’s nice, she has a good sense of humor, she treated me respectfully and was interested in what I had to say, and I genuinely enjoyed hanging out with her. I said I’d call next week and schedule another date. One problem, though, was that she was wearing a very tight, low-cut, red blouse, and she has major fucking yabboes—which is why I suspect she was wearing a very tight, low-cut, red blouse: to show them off. (Thanks!) I had to be on my best behavior to not stare stupidly at her chest. I think I was mostly successful. Impressive rack, though. Really.   Tonight is a phone date with Sharon, the civil rights lawyer with the great sense of humor. If it goes well, I’ll ask her out for a coffee date, probably for sometime next week. Cheryl is flying in tomorrow to do naughty things to me, so I’m fully booked (and will most likely be nekkid) until Monday.   Another eHarmony lovely, Chi Yon (Korean, majorly cute), and I have started directly communicating through eHarmony’s email program. I expect we’ll be talking or going out within a week. Same deal with Jennifer the pediatrician (who is also a cutie). And another from the latest crop of potentials delivered to my mailbox this very morning just responded. I haven’t replied yet but will some time today.   So I’m basically dating or semi-dating four women right now—and I like it. And no, it’s not that I am trying to build a harem (tempting, though), it just makes me feel good that I have these NICE, NORMAL, women who want to spend time with me and want to get to know me. Plus with juggling multiple females, I don’t have all my eggs in one basket and I can therefore be logical in my evaluations. Lastly, it makes up for how things went with Ruth last weekend and gives me hope that not all women are evil, soul-devouring Succubi from the deepest, darkest, coldest pit of Hell sent by Satan to torture me. eHarmony may indeed help me to throw off the mantle of being a magnet for the psychologically damaged.   Besides the above Potential Love Bunnies, there are now five additional women (for a total of 9 Potential Love Bunnies) with whom I’ve initiated contact via eHarmony as of this morning, so eHarmony is my bestest buddy right now in spite of the fact that it’s run by a Fundie. Neil Clark Warren, the founder of eHarmony, is in love with the Lord, which is why he preaches no pre-marital sex (get real) and why he won’t match gay people (God hates fags). I’m not thrilled about giving my money to a person whose religion and politics I personally find repulsive and repugnant, but if he can help me find a Senior Love Bunny to snuggle with before the glaciers return to Chicagoland, I don’t really care. I figure that by giving money to the ACLU or to Americans United for Separation of Church and State, I’m somehow restoring the original philosophical yin and yang of the Universe and assuaging my Liberal guilt. Or so I tell myself.   No word from Ruth (bitch) since last week, but I’m grateful for that as I have no interest in spending time with her (loser) or even acknowledging her fucked up existence (jerk). She is yet another data point proving my theory that there is no such thing as a Beautiful Woman who is also a decent human being. I have yet to meet a single Beautiful Woman who was worth the powder it would take to blow her up. Which is why I usually go for pretty or normal looking only. Beautiful is too much effort for too little payoff, and in general the price is way too high. If you want beautiful, rent a comely hooker. It’s purely a business arrangement, and once you’re done, she goes away so you don’t have to deal with her Beautiful Woman bullshit.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Now that the dust from the weekend has settled and I have a better perspective on The Way of Things, life is much better.   Last night I had a great phone date with Audrey, one of my eHarmony babes. We’ve arranged a coffee date for this Wednesday. I will also be having a phone date this week with Sharon, the civil rights lawyer who has a wonderful sense of humor. Jennifer (cute blonde pediatrician from eHarmony) and I have just started emailing each other. And two other women from eHarmony are in the beginning stages of contact. I have options. Life is good.   I also spent time yesterday reflecting on Ruth. What I did wrong, what I should have done, and who and what she really was.   What I did wrong was obvious: I put way too much into her without knowing her well enough to do so, and I allowed my emotions to take control instead of relying on my intuition and experience that have served me unerringly and have allowed me to survive to the age of 41. I also know why I did this: I didn’t have enough other (good) options to allow myself to be dispassionate and evaluate her critically. Had I had more, better options, I wouldn’t have wasted time on a second date.   And why is that? Well, from the first date, there were several things about her that bothered me—and I ignored them. The first is that she’s vulgar. I swear like a sailor (Former Marine. It goes with the territory.), but I try to tone it down when I’m with people so I don’t sound like trailer trash. She’s worse than I am. She had started to tone it down a bit, but still, her vulgarity and the other ridiculous non-vulgar things&nbsp;that came out of her mouth were both puerile and churlish. That's CollegeSpeak for "bimbotic". [Bimbotic: adjectival form of the noun “bimbo”, which is possibly a contraction of the Italian word “ Bambina ”, or “baby girl”.]   The second thing that bothered me is that she’s immature. She’s a forty-year-old woman who acts like she’s a twenty-three-year-old party girl. She can probably pull this off for another five years until the boobs drop and the skin starts to get thicken and sag (she’s already had fat injections to her face to cover the laugh lines), but after that it will be pathetic. There’s a reason why there are no fifty-year-old sorority girls.   The last thing that troubled me was that EVERYTHING WAS ALL ABOUT HER. She’s self-absorbed, shallow, and selfish. She was like Mary from San Diego in that I was only able to get a word in about every ten minutes.&nbsp;When I did eventually get the chance to speak, Ruth quickly steered the conversation back to her. Me, me, me...   So why didn’t I notice all this? For the reasons above, but for one other reason, too: Ruth is  charming .&nbsp;I’ve already stated how gorgeous she was, and that alone was very distracting, but she’s even more charming than she is beautiful.   It was interesting to notice when we were together how others—particularly men—respond to her. They smile stupidly, their eyes become moist and vacant, and they have no absolutely no control over themselves or their actions. They become endorphin-soaked zombie slaves, and I was one of them.   I’ve come to the conclusion that Ruth isn’t a Succubus; she’s a Siren. An entirely new classification of female behavior. I was Odysseus lashed to the mast, and she was the Siren calling me toward the rocks and certain doom. Only unlike Odysseus who smartly plugged the ears of his crew with wax so they couldn’t hear the Sirens’ song, my crew was all ears and steered the fucking boat right into the rocks. The Coast Guard is still fishing the bodies out of the water.   But like Odysseus, I have survived to fight another day, and I will continue my journey to Ithaca until I either find my way home or die, whichever comes first. Since defeat isn’t an option, I guess Ithaca needs to start planning the welcome home party. I like my steak medium, and my beer cold, thanks.

      I just got back from my “date” with Ruth. Why the quotes, you ask? Well, although I had a good time with her today at the “Taste of Lincoln Avenue” (great street fair, by the way), her signals were mixed. At times she seemed into me, at other times, she was only friendly. So at the end of the “date”, I asked her directly what we were doing here. Were we dating, or was it just friends. Her reply was “Oh, we’re just friends. Is that okay?” I mumbled something that approximated “sure”, reached down to collect my battered and bleeding heart that had fallen from the gaping wound in what used to be my chest, tried to assemble what dignity I could, and then turned and walked back to the L station at Fullerton.   “Oh, we’re just friends. Is that okay?”   No, it’s not okay. In fact, it’s pretty fucking far from being okay.   I don’t know what changed or when, and I suppose it really doesn’t matter. I’m not going to analyze it to death. No means no, and I need to get on with my life.   And what is the lesson learned here? There isn’t one. Dating just sucks, which is the real reason why people get married. They get married so they don’t have to suffer the humiliation, trauma, and disappointment of dating. Building a life together, bonding, sharing experiences, laughing together, being able to have make love with your best friend, and being there for one another in hard times are all secondary. Mostly it’s so that we no longer have to go on dates.   Ruth wants me to email or call. I think I also mumbled “sure” while inside I was dying of humiliation and disappointment. I won’t call. I can’t. There’s no way I can be friends with this woman who is the most interesting and amazing woman I have ever met. Every time I’d see her I would be reminded that she doesn’t see me as a man. She sees me as a “friend”, which is a sort of non-state. I’m a thing, hardly even a person. Just a brief bit of entertainment when she has nothing better to do. Not acceptable. I deserve better, and I accept charity or pity from no one.&nbsp;   So what now? What now is that I cowboy the fuck up, dust myself off, and start the Sisyphean task of dating once again—the ultimate purpose of which is to not have to go on dates anymore. The very definition of irony, don't ya think?   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Cheryl, my former San Diego paramour and I have remained in communication since I left San Diego. My loyal readers will remember that she flew out here in June to visit me. Much fun was had by both of us, and we’ve stayed in touch since.   The history is that we were dating in San Diego and went from a casual arrangement of no expectations and great sex to a semi-formalized boyfriend/girlfriend relationship with great sex, but once I made the decision to move to Chicagoland, I was quite clear that I didn’t want a long-distance relationship. She was teary-eyed, but she accepted that I needed to come here, and she accepted my logic as to why I didn’t want to have a long-distance relationship. We agreed to see each other when we could with no strings. Which is a limbo relationship and is completely open to misinterpretation, hurt feelings, and disaster. Note to self which has been consistently ignored: Ain’t no such thing as fuck buddies.   Cheryl planned on flying out to see me again next weekend, but lately has been sending me lots of emails telling me how much she misses me. A clear violation of NSA protocol (No Strings Attached), this behavior reached critical mass on Monday, so I told her we needed to talk. Last night we did.   It went well considering, and I’ve decided to condense the conversation into its essential elements so as to not bore readers with trivial details and over-extended dialogue. This is basically what was said:   Her: ...But I want us to be serious.  Me: No.  Her: But I want to.  Me: No.  Her: Oh, c’mon.  Me: No. Don’t wanna, and you can’t make me.  Her: (Pauses, then gives up.) So do you still want me to fly to Chicago next weekend so we can have sex?  Me: Yes.  Her: Good.   So with everything resolved to some sort of mutual satisfaction, I ended the conversation, thanked the Gods for helping me dodge yet another bullet in a lifetime of having dodged more bullets than Keanu Reeves in  The Matrix , and I went to bed with the satisfaction that in a week I’d be spending time and having fantastic sex with a woman who I genuinely like and enjoy. Life is good, and maybe Fuck Buddies do exist in this dimension of reality.   Then this morning I get an email. From her.   She feels lost. There are things she doesn’t understand. Maybe we can talk when she comes out here.   Jesus Fucking Christ on a Motherfucking Crutch.   So I mail her back and say that I’d prefer we talk before she fly out so if there are still things that need to be settled, we can settle them now and spend our time playing tourist and further breaking in my sex swing rather than spend it “working things out”. She agrees. We’ll speak again on Monday. She flies to O’Hare on Friday.   Obviously I did not get my point across last night, and I will have to be even clearer if that’s at all possible. The offer will be this: she can come to visit me ONLY with the understanding that it will be a no strings weekend of fun with no emotional attachment. If not, then she cannot come visit me. That’s it. Those are the terms. Take it or leave it.   My sister Susie will no doubt be sending me a big, fat note saying “I TOLD YOU SO”, as she mailed me this morning to inform me officially that she reserves the right to say I TOLD YOU SO when I do stupid shit that she told me not to do. (Susie is my de facto conscience and moral sounding board as I have no conscience and I do not listen to my own advice, only give it.)   In other news, Ruth has confirmed our date for tomorrow. I am indifferent. Her emailed reply was courteous, which is the kiss of death. When women are polite like they’re a flight attendant asking if you want a coke or a bag of nuts, it means you are dead in the water. Shark food. Fish bait. I’ll still go through with the date, if only out of morbid curiosity and because I am not rude and do not break dates.&nbsp;But if she gives me any shit or is a cold fish, I’m bailing on the spot, and I don’t care if I’m polite about it or not. I no longer see the need to be “nice” to women that treat me badly, use me, or play games. There are assholes that tread the Earth, and being nice to them is not a requirement unless you are a Jainist or your name is Rainbow.   Update: Cheryl just mailed me and will call tonight. Good. I can get this all settled so I’ll know whether or not next weekend will be free before I go on my date with Ruth tomorrow. That way if by some miracle Ruth is indeed interested and is not an evil, soul-devouring Succubus from the deepest, darkest pit of Hell sent by Satan to torture me, I can book another date with her for next weekend, or possibly Audrey if our phone conversation on Monday goes well.

      Tuesday night I called Ruth. Spoke to her for an hour, but I’m surprised that it went that long since I got no energy or enthusiasm from her at all. None. I might as well have been speaking to someone from the DMV about getting my driver’s license transferred from California to Illinois; I would have gotten more warmth from them. The other thing that  really  pissed me off was that I presented her with four great ideas for a date this Saturday, and she shot down three of the four activities unceremoniously, and she was lukewarm to the fourth. She could have at least have been gracious enough to thank me for making the effort to come up with&nbsp;activities that she would enjoy. Bitch.  &nbsp;  I was left completely confused from the conversation, and I don’t get it. Maybe she wasn’t feeling well or maybe she was just in a pissy mood, but I’m not going to perform a&nbsp;feat of mental gymnastics to figure out what the fuck is going on inside her head. I learned after Evil Fundie Christian Girl that what you see is what you get. Figuring out a woman’s psyche is a waste of time. Freud was correct in that a woman’s mind is unfathomable, so the key to dealing with women is to accept what you see and make decisions based on a woman's actions&nbsp;and behavior, not on what you think is going on inside her skull. And in fairness, this strategy can be&nbsp;employed&nbsp;by women as well in order to evaluate men. It works&nbsp;both ways.  &nbsp;  I have no idea what changed between our fantastic first date on Saturday and the shitty phone call on Tuesday. Maybe now that she thinks I’m hooked, the real person is coming out, and&nbsp;that person is&nbsp;going to be someone I don’t like. That could very well be, and I’ve seen this behavior&nbsp;before. Mary from San Diego was like that, and I can think of two others that once I appeared&nbsp;interested, opened up, and inside was a yet another soul-devouring Succubus from the deepest, darkest pit of Hell sent by Satan to torture me. I am a magnet for the psychologically damaged, so I need to be on guard at all times to protect myself from these demi-sociopaths.  &nbsp;  Anyway, Ruth—who may or may not turn out to be a soul-devouring Succubus from the deepest, darkest pit of Hell—is on super-double-extra-special-ultra-secret-mega-maximum probation until further notice. We’re supposed to go out on Saturday, and if I don’t see an improvement in her attitude, she's fucking history. I have too much self-respect to tolerate women's bullshit or psychopathology. Besides, I have other options, to wit...  &nbsp;  Audrey from eHarmony is back from Ireland, and she and I are supposed to chat by phone this Sunday night. I’m looking forward to speaking with her as she seems NORMAL and low-maintenance. I’m also conversing by email with another eHarmony woman who is a&nbsp;civil rights lawyer. Major bonus points for that, and she, too, seems NORMAL (and cute).&nbsp; Lastly, eHarmony plopped another crop of potentials&nbsp;in my lap this morning, so&nbsp;I need to go through them one by one soon and evaluate each for compatibility. I'm getting a new crop about every three days. Girlfriend Quest 2004 continues.  &nbsp;&nbsp;

      Okay, so all my loyal readers will probably want to know how things went with Ruth on Saturday&nbsp;since I’ve been whining about how much I need a girlfriend for over a month…&nbsp;  &nbsp;  IT WAS REMARKABLE. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  We met at a local pub in her neighborhood, ate, had a couple of drinks—and talked for four hours straight. And while we talked for four hours, it seemed like fifteen minutes. We could have sat there for another four hours except we both had other things to do. Neither of us expected to be there that long, I think. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  If our date could be condensed into a short catch phrase, it would be “Exceeded All Expectations”.&nbsp; I think we both felt that way, and we were both definitely surprised that it went as well as it did.&nbsp; We see the world the same way, we have lots in common, there’s more chemistry here than in a meth lab, and there’s a physical attraction to boot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The last part I was worried about since after she replied to my personal on  Craig’s List  , I sent her my photo, she saw it, and she was less than impressed (I told her to be honest, and she was. She’s direct, and I like that as I know I won’t be bullshitted.) But I also told her I was not photogenic (I’m not), and I would probably look better in the flesh than on celluloid (I do). We both figured that we’d meet and be end up as friends only, and I was basically fine with that since from our email chats I thought she was a cool person and would be fun to hang out with. But when we met, she warmed up quickly and gave lots of hints that she was interested in dating me. I would have been comfortable as friends only, but was I relieved? Sure.   As to  her  appearance, I thought from the photo she had sent me that she was extremely cute, very closely bordering on outrageously gorgeous. Wrong. She’s absolutely stunningly beautiful. Looks  maybe  32 although she's 40, and has a body that could stop a full-grown charging rhino at 300 yards. My God, those legs…She is one of the sexiest, most beautiful women I have ever seen. Gorgeous smile, sexy brown eyes that are both mischievous and happy at the same time, and wild, curly, dark brown hair with blondish highlights that reaches to her perfect, slender, athletic shoulders. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Personality? She’s smart, funny, witty, charming, warm, friendly, outgoing, compassionate, strong, capable, sophisticated, educated, cultured, creative, urban, hip, cool, funky, and politically liberal. In short, she is my dream girl. My guess is that given her beauty and personality, and since Ruth is extremely direct and does not&nbsp;tolerate bullshit at all (from talking with her I think her bullshit detector is as sensitive as is my intuition), she probably intimidates the hell out of most men who are interested in her. But if she does indeed intimidate most men, it’s their loss and my gain. I’m not intimidated.&nbsp; I think the problem is that most men don’t “get” her, and I seem to, so I feel comfortable around her.   I emailed her yesterday to tell her what a good time I had&nbsp; (thanks, Susie), and she emailed me right back with as much enthusiasm about our date as I had. We’ll talk Tuesday and plan another date for later this week or the weekend. I can’t fucking wait. I think neither can she. I'm on springs. You could drop a bomb on me, and I totally wouldn’t care. Probably wouldn’t even notice.&nbsp; I am utterly besotted with this amazing, incredible woman, and I hope to post more (positive) details soon. Currently I am doing the Dance of the Sugar Plum Faeries, which is similar to the Happy Heinie Dance, but involves more skipping and Martha Graham hand motions than booty wagging.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Yesterday afternoon I drove through the suburban hell that is Skokie and continued my Nesting Frenzy by dropping a big wad of cash at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. All I can say is that 1000 thread count sheets are completely fucking yummy and to die for. Expensive, but well worth it. Turns any bed from a cheap crack whore into a $10,000 a night Hollywood hooker. Roald approves. He’s been camped out on them since last night. I also picked up new (good) towels and a bunch of other bathroom stuff. My place is really shaping up. Good. I have a potential new Love Interest who may be visiting (oh boy, oh boy, oh boy…), and I need to get things in shape, anyway, since the glaciers will be returning soon and I’ll be spending lots of time indoors to keep from being harvested by saber-toothed tigers and woolly mammoths.  Other stuff…&nbsp;   To  Shane : Do you know why you can no longer freeload off of my home wireless network? Because I configured my router to use MAC address security, you cheap fuck, so unless you have a quantum computer from MIT loaded with cryptography software so you can hack my unique hexadecimal MAC address, YOU’RE FUCKED.&nbsp; If you want a wireless Internet connection, feel free to go buy yourself a wireless broadband router and pay Comcast fifty bucks a month like I do, you fucking parasite. You’ve been sucking away my bandwidth for a week. No more, you Loser. My Kung Fu is better than your Kung Fu. Fucker.  &nbsp;  Rant over.  &nbsp;  I am severely disappointed in this season’s  Six Feet Under , and that feeling reached a crescendo with last night’s episode…  &nbsp;  Nate: Is becoming a maudlin, whiney little bitch. Boo-hoo, your wife died. That doesn't give you the right to fall apart, quit your job, and become a miserable prick. Suck it up. You have a daughter to take care of, and she needs you. And besides, you didn’t love and probably didn’t even  like  your wife. You should be dancing and singing with glee now that the boring, self-righteous, vegan&nbsp;cow is worm food (And for the record I find it highly ironic that a vegan chef ended up being  eaten  by sharks. The screenwriters get major points for that one.) Plus now you can go fuck other women, not that being married ever stopped you. Get over yourself.  &nbsp;  David: You stupid fuck. EVERYONE knows that picking up hitchhikers is dumb, and the whole kidnapping sequence was both contrived and lame. Stop being a fucking victim. Are the writers so burned out that they have to turn to cliché?  &nbsp;  Keith: The screenwriters either need to make his character grow or kill him the fuck off. I’m tired of his bullshit, and I’m tired of him treating David like shit. David does need a set of balls, but that still doesn’t give Keith the right to treat David as disrespectfully as he does.  &nbsp;  Claire: The writers have been not-so-subtly preparing us for a lesbian romp between Claire and Mena Suvari that will probably take place in next week’s episode. While I would certainly enjoy a Sapphic embrace between Lauren Ambrose and Mena—hopefully with an extreme degree of nekkidness—lesbianism is passé. You hear that screenwriters? It was passé when Britney and Madonna snogged on stage, and it was passé as far back as the  Buffy  episode with the spit-swapping between the Allison Hannigan character and her new-found lesbian friend. Fact: Women doing each other is no longer a thrilling novelty. If we want to watch lipstick lesbians going at it, we’ll rent porn. Write something original. And Claire’s whining, depressing&nbsp; weltschmertz  is getting old. Being angry at the world and bitter and cynical&nbsp;are not requirements to be an artist. Well, actually&nbsp;they are&nbsp;since all art comes from pain, but still, it gets old. We don’t need it in our faces every single week. Be happy for once. Sheesh.  &nbsp;  Ruth: Not happy with the marital strife between George and Ruth. Can there be at least one normal, happy couple in this show to prove that it’s actually worth it to make the effort to build a relationship? And besides, while certainly not as perfect, incredible, and amazing as  my  Ruth who is a goddess devoutly to be worshipped with offerings of food, incense, and libations of good California Cabernet,  SFU ’s Ruth deserves some happiness after all the shit her kids have put her through. Claire, especially.  &nbsp;  Brenda: At least here is a character that seems to be getting her shit together. She’s got a great, normal guy (played by the fine actor Justin Theroux, who was the only good thing about  Charlie's Chicks II ) who treats her well, and she’s decided to become a shrink and help others. Good for her. Now go ahead and slap the shit out of your bitch mother. There are some serious boundary issues between Brenda and her mom, and the only way they will ever be resolved is for Brenda to hold her mother by the ankles and dangle her over the balcony of Mom’s snooty rich people condo and tell her that if she ever says anything disrespectful to her again, she will drop her to the concrete below and watch her head splatter like an overripe watermelon. Sometimes force is the only thing that people understand. I learned that from the Marine Corps.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I am not happy with this season. Makes me pine for  Deadwood , which has the gritty, no-whining realism that I enjoy. Even  The Sopranos  wasn’t that good this season. What gives, HBO? I rely on you for good, decent, thoughtful entertainment that challenges me. Do I need to slide down the evolutionary ladder and start watching reality TV on Fox? For shame.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      So out of boredom today I decided to Google on  Society > Religion > Opposing Views . Basically what I was searching for were sites that have opposing views on religion in whatever form. Just poking around.   What I found most interesting perusing this Google page were the numbers, the statistics. I was trained as an economist, so I live for numbers. Especially if there are dollar signs in front of them.   Going by the numbers, this is the breakdown:   · Christianity leads the pack with a whopping 726 sites that poke fun at, excoriate, or refute Christianity.  · The number two spot is taken up by Scientology (297). No surprise there, in spite of its popularity with the movers and shakers in Hollywood.  · Third is Islam with 182 sites. I’m only surprised that there weren’t  more  sites, but people are probably scared to create an anti-Islamic site lest some Imam issue a  fatwa  and the supposed infidel’s severed head end up being waved around&nbsp;on Al-Jazeera.  · Fourth is New Age (115). Black Nikes and funky Cool Aid? I think not.  · Five is Buddhism with 74 sites. Now THIS surprised me. If you are an agnostic and someone held a gun to your head and told you to join a religious group, this is what you’d join. But some folks obviously don’t feel that way, and they think that Buddhism is wrong, stupid, or funny. Go figure. Maybe it’s the silly hats that Tibetan Buddhist monks wear. Makes you look like some sort of multi-colored shellfish is eating your head.   In reverse order, the lowest number of opposing sites goes to Agnosticism. It seems that Agnostics piss off people the least. Good. That’s what I am.   Of all the major religions, Judaism has the second lowest tally (11), and Taoism wins with only 4 sites. Possible explanations? Well, Taoism may piss off folks the least, but more probably it’s the case that no one really knows what Taoism is--not even Taoists--hence no one can refute it or poke fun at it. If this assumption is correct, then this leaves Judaism in the lead (Go Jude!). Or Hinduism if the tally is weighted with the total number of adherents. Here, Hindus only moderately piss people off with 54 sites. But in the case of Hinduism I’m also guessing that not many folks other than Hindus really know much about Hinduism, so this again puts Judaism in the lead since it’s pretty obvious that most folks know about Jews. After all, who hasn’t ever eaten a bagel? Judaism isn’t exactly an unknown entity. Ask any Muslim or German.   The end result of all these numbers is that if you want to piss people off the least, either become an Agnostic (like myself), or if you insist on believing in something, become a Jew. But does this really wash? Not really. Why? Because there are at least a billion people on this planet that hate Jews. Hate them, and probably think that Hitler was grossly misunderstood.   It follows then that if pissing people off or the lack of knowledge about a religion are not the criteria for establishing numbers of anti-religious web sites, then the true criteria must be that the lowest number of opposing view sites per religion determines which religion is the most philosophically correct--as a dearth of opposing view sites seems to indicate that&nbsp;that particular religion cannot be refuted or at least cannot be refuted easily. Based on this new assumption, then, if one weren’t an Agnostic, the best major religion to choose that is most probably correct in its view of the universe is Judaism. Go out and convert now. Just don’t hang around any Nazi rallies or go poking around the West Bank looking for good garage sales.   Next logical step: Since Christianity overwhelmingly heads the category of opposing views and we’ve established that the numbers of opposing view web sites determine the degree of truth or untruth of religious beliefs, logic dictates that Christianity is the most inaccurate, silly, absurd religion out there. But of all the Christian denominations, which Christian denomination is thought to be the most errant or ridiculous? Let’s see, shall we...   · Catholicism: Easily takes the lead with 140 sites. I am not surprised even a little bit. The followers of Cathol are a strange lot, and their theological assumptions are just plain weird. Virgin birth? C’mon. Sorry, but&nbsp;Mary got knocked up in the usual manner.&nbsp;Infallibility of the Pope? Give me a break. Popes have had standing armies, mistresses, and what about that Galileo incident?&nbsp;Oops, the World is  not  the center of the universe. Guess we were  wrong  about that one, huh? Christ, I was raised Catholic, and I’m still recovering. Great art and architecture, but truly fucked up theology. Anti-gay, anti-woman, anti-sex...anti everything but  what they tell you  is okay...Catholians invented thought control.  · Jehovah’s Witnesses: 108 sites. No explanation needed. DO NOT open your door if the doorbell rings.  · Mormons are third with 49 sites. Nice-looking architecture, but no way I’m giving up coffee. I do like the idea of polygamy, but it’s more that I want to have sex with multiple females, not marry them.  · The lowest score goes to the Apostolic Christian Church with 2 sites. This cannot be the least theologically incorrect flavor of Christ’s followers, so it must be that only five people are members.  &nbsp;  So what is the final result of this analysis? Agnosticism is the closest path to finding God. In other words, ignoring God is the best way to know God. But if you absolutely need to go somewhere on a Friday night and hang out, sing, and kibbitz, become Jewish.

       Droning on, and on, and on, and on… My Brain is shutting down.  Help. Oh, no, My Brain is now dead. Meaningless drivel sandblasts my mind, and my sense of self erodes grain by grain. What is left? Mission statement, Project Plan, Deliverables, Show-Stoppers, Expectations... “Are we on the same page, or do we need to change the target end date to manage the effectivity of the project?” Confusion abounds--nothing is clear--and Politics emerges. Personalities clash as egos are bruised, enemies are made, and revenge is planned ...Alliances form. Armistice is declared, but strategies and plots spawn in the cold, dark silence between words. Nothing is achieved, but yet another meeting is planned. Where it will start all over again...

       Girlfriend Quest 2004   There are now six eHarmony lovelies with whom I am in communication.  All are nice. Juggling them all (I think there are 12 total right now in varying stages) during the evaluation phase is becoming a challenge. Fortunately eHarmony has a workflow management process built into their software. It’s very cool. The latest reply is from a local shrink. Jewish and absolutely stunning. Shrinks, unfortunately, are usually fucked up—which is why they become shrinks—but I’m trying to be optimistic.  Ruth and I are set to have lunch this Saturday. Really, really, really, really, really looking forward to it. So far we seem to have clicked more than a million Zippos at a Grateful Dead concert.  She is just  SO  fucking cute. And pretty. And funny. And bright. And cool. Can’t wait to meet her. And yes, I am trying to manage my expectations even though I am totally besotted with her and have already named our beautiful, intelligent, charming children (Seth and Rebecca) who are always well behaved in restaurants. There are too many variables at work, and any time you date someone, there’s a 90% chance that nothing will happen. I cannot do the Dance of the Sugar Plum Faeries just yet. But hopefully soon…She is just so fucking cute!!! Aaaaaaaaahhhhh!!! Can’t wait.  I also have a personal ad with Match.com, and I got a communiqué from a local redhead last night. She’s a computer geek like I am, loves the outdoors, and we seem to have lots in common. Looks a little like the actress Blair Brown. Wears funky hats. I will be sending her a note shortly.   Work   Work does not usually get discussed in my blog as I have a cat to feed and would rather keep my job. So let’s just say that David is not a happy camper right now, but is not at the point where he needs to do something. The situation may resolve itself in a few months. I hope. If not, I will have to hire the appropriate ne’er-do-wells to remove the problem for me. The character “Don” played by Ben Kingsley in  Sexy Beast  comes to mind. Yeah, hire Don and smoke this motherfucker off the face of the Earth. Go, Don.  There is now a second married chick that has made it quite clear that she wants to fuck me (my sister thinks I put out vibes), but so far I have not indulged. Guys, can you please take care of your fucking wimmin? I mean really. How hard is it to fuck your wives so they are content and don’t need to stray? I don’t need this shit. It’s annoying. Do your job.   Other   Had my second yoga class last night. I love it. Like last time, I was the only student who showed, so I got a one-on-one with Kerri the instructor. I can’t believe how good I felt afterward. I’ve decided that I’m going to make this a regular thing. The other reason to go is that yoga chicks are hot and yoga classes are mostly women. The instructor for the next class after mine came in a few minutes early, and I had to put forth supreme effort to keep my jaw from hitting the floor and drooling uncontrollably. Absolutely one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen living on this planet.  An interesting sociological tidbit based on the above: At the end of the class, Kerri and I were talking—strictly friendly—and Yoga Goddess, I think, wasn’t used to a male paying attention to a woman other than her. So Yoga Goddess puts her hands on her hips (to make her boobs stand out), thrusts her lovely mammalian globes outward, walks over—hands still on hips and boobs still being used as an attractor and competitive weapon—and inserts herself into the conversation (“Hi, I’m So-And-So, and these are my breasts. Do you like them?”). I left without acknowledging her since I had no intention of stroking her female ego (Pretty People only date Pretty People. She was only competing with Kerri, not showing interest in me.) But I do always find it amusing when women compete with each other over men.   I am BORED. In all CAPS. In San Diego I had lots to do since I was surrounded by Nature in all its cute, pink, fuzzy glory. Here I ain’t got that. I could start skydiving again, but the only decent dropzone in Chicagoland is run by Fundies. No way I’m going to give my money to fucking Christians or subject myself to their arrogant, mindless proselytizing.   They even have a missionary organization at the DZ (for real) to convert us heathens into good little Christian zombie skydivers. My guess is that they are trying to recruit and train an army of skydiving Christian Holy Warriors to be used as paratroopers and shock troops in the future conflict between the Faithful and the rest of us Godless Commie Liberal Secular Humanists who believe in such things as freedom of thought, social and scientific progress, and access to porn. Anyway, the point is that I need interesting things to do here. Soon. I don’t suffer boredom easily. Any ideas? BASE jumping off the top of the John Hancock building comes to mind, but I’m open to suggestions.

      eHarmony sent even more lovelies my way last night. Another half a dozen or so, all in Chicago this time. And once again, they were all lawyers, but the initial avalanche of redheads has been replaced by brunettes. I’m still pleasantly surprised that they all seem to be nice, normal women. Got a reply from another woman today, so I’ve started the mating dance with her as well as with one other from eHarmony. About ten others have yet to reply. I also put a personal ad in Craig’s List two days ago, and I’m in contact with a woman who replied to my ad. A painter (yay), and Jewish (double yay). She’s a former options trader. Very cute.  I swear this is like trying to find a job, or more accurately, I’m interviewing women for the position of Love Bunny. It’s tough work. And it really is like finding a job, but at least the end result will be more pleasant than a job.  Tomorrow I start yoga at a yoga studio a couple of blocks away. I’ve been a slug since I moved here, and I really, really need to get my ass in gear and maintain my level of fitness. Besides, I have a great ass, and I want to show it off. I must avoid getting Baseball Butt at all costs.  No plans this weekend since it’s supposed to rain today through Sunday. Ugh. I think Chicago only gets about ten good weather days per year. But I think I have a solution: Move Chicago to southern California.   How would this work? Well, Chicago can annex LA County, declare Imminent Domain, condemn all the properties, and then move the existing LA residents to Arizona. Southern Californians are moving to Arizona, anyway, because they can get cheaper housing and re-create all the problems that made them want to leave SoCal in the first place.  Chicago is a tough city like New York, and with Californians being so laid back, Los Angelenos won’t resist or won’t be able to resist being forced to pack up and leave. Really. They probably wouldn’t even notice, anyway, since they’re too self-absorbed to focus on anything selfless like a group protest. Just move them to Arizona and tell them that the Big One hit and the sea levels dropped. That’s why they can no longer see the coast.  Granted moving the entire Chicago city skyline to SoCal wouldn’t be easy, but think of all the folks who are out of work and need a job. This would create thousands of jobs lasting a decade or more. And LA County would finally have decent architecture and real culture.  Those who are left behind in Cook County win as well: with most of Cook County evacuated to greener (sunnier) pastures, traffic would dissipate to almost nothing. Everybody wins. Even the Californians as they will finally have affordable housing and even more days of sunshine than they had in LA.  Sounds good? Then let’s form an organization. Call it the “Chicago Relocation Foundation”, or “Annex LA!”  Donations are gladly accepted. Make checks payable to “David George”.

      This weekend was a road trip to see my cousin Genie and her family in the wilds of southern Illinois.  Genie and her husband Geoff and son Max live in Makanda, about ten miles south of Carbondale. Geoff runs an outdoor education program for Southern Illinois University, and the family lives in a cabin on the site of the program's facility in the middle of the forest, right on the edge of Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge. While you can't, say, get a decent latte within ten miles, if you love the outdoors, it's the perfect place to be.  I drove downstate on Saturday, and after three hundred miles of cornfields (locals call it "The Corn Desert"), you leave the flat plains of northern and central Illinois and enter a completely different ecosystem. Genie and Geoff live about an hour from the Missouri and Kentucky borders, near the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. The land is mostly rolling hills and is heavily forested.   Ten thousand years ago the glaciers reached their most southerly point about twenty miles north of Carbondale, so the region was never touched by the ice that created the great lakes and the plains. The region is a rich transition zone of northern and southern species. It's an ecologist's dream. Rivers, lakes, creeks, and dense, green forests. It's almost primordial.  I arrived late on Saturday, so Sunday was the first active day of the trip. Late Sunday morning, Genie and I took a trip to a local farm to pick blueberries. Loved it. Foraging for one's food has an enjoyment that cannot be duplicated by shopping at the local Piggly Wiggly. I have about fifty pounds of blueberries in my freezer, and I expect that my skin will turn completely blue within a month.  After picking blueberries I went on a hike with Genie and her son Max in Giant City State Park. I've always loved places that have a harsh winter, as during the summer there's an explosion of life. Every square centimeter was covered with living things, and there was almost an infinite spectrum of green colors like you see in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. You could almost feel the pulse of life as the plants and animals frantically grow, reproduce, and feed in the short time they have to do so before winter returns. Combine the Arctic and Cambodia, and you have a sense of what it's like in Southern Illinois.  Be warned, though, if you plan on visiting southern Illinois during the summer: It's hot. And humid. And buggy. So hot and humid and buggy that while hiking I expected to be attacked by a contingent of Khmer Rouge. I'm still covered in bug bites.  Max (who is four) did well on the hike other than not having a developed sense of navigation but insisting that he knew where the trail lead (a genetically male trait, I'm convinced). Several battles later Genie and I were able to successfully herd him in the right direction. And it really was like herding. Imagine a cat that can speak.  After the hike was a short drive to Little Grassy Lake where we dove into the water and swam to cool down. Then after the swim we paddled around the lake in an old aluminum Grumman canoe. Other than our conversation and laughter and the occasional metallic thud of paddles on the sides of the canoe, the lake was silent.  Once we had tired ourselves out, we beached the canoe and packed up and returned to the cabin to cook dinner. Then with full bellies and our bloodstreams diluted with several beers, we indulged in the ultimate White Trash sport: Fireworks.  Geoff had built a mobile bottle-rocket launcher that looks something like a bazooka and had an Al Qaeda-sized supply of fireworks he bought in Missouri, which we used to amuse ourselves and scare the shit out of the local critters. Afterward the area looked like a combat zone. Bits of shredded, burned explosives covered the scorched and smoking ground, and the air was filled with whitish gray smoke and the acrid smell of gunpowder. I don't know if the bunnies will ever recover. Don't care. Blowing stuff up is fun. Makes me wonder if I should get a pickup truck so I can spotlight deer while drunk on Budweiser. You can take the boy out of the trailer park, but you can't take the trailer park out of the boy. Yee-hah.  Socially it was a good visit as well. Geoff and Genie are good folks, and they've managed to raise a great kid. Max is intelligent, handsome, and has a positive, happy core personality. You couldn't really ask for a better child. Other than him cycling between emotional states faster than a manic-depressive (totally normal for a four-year-old), I enjoyed him. Except once.  Sunday morning Max was in a rather bad mood, and he decided to take it out on me by calling me "stinkypants", accusing me of being one who habitually shits in his pants [not true]. Max is not allowed to use foul language, so he gets around the foul language prohibition by using creative negative monikers in order to display his displeasure over whatever.  Genie told him to apologize, and he refused--of course--just as I would have. The conversation went something like this...    Genie: That's not a very nice thing to say. Max: He's a stinkypants. Genie: That's not nice. You should apologize. Max: He's mean. Me: You're mean. Max: (Surprised that I would say that) I don't like you. Me: I don't like you, either. (Pause) I'm not the one who called you a "stinkypants". Max: (Silence as he contemplated what I said.)   A minute later Max and I were playing soccer. Problem solved, and we were best buds for the rest of the weekend. Max seemed to understand and appreciate my male approach to solving disagreements (argue back). Men can argue bitterly over just about anything, and then two minutes later be out drinking beer, bonding, and laughing like idiots. Testosterone 1, Estrogen 0.  Overall I had a great time, but driving home yesterday on the Dan Ryan, I saw the gorgeous Chicago skyline and the Sears Tower bathed in a solid layer of thick, gray clouds and was thankful to be home. I really do need the energy and pace of a big city. Oh, and I rescind my initial negative impression of Chicago. It's a great city. But I still hate suburban Chicagoland...  Once home, I apologized to a pissed-off, lonely cat for about an hour then unpacked and started treating the bug bites. Today I'm trying to not shred my skin. Thank God for rubbing alcohol.  My quest to find a woman with whom to nest is proceeding swimmingly. eHarmony has kept up their end of the bargain and has supplied a number of matches. Most are not local, but they are all good quality. I am, however, noticing a trend: most are fiery redheads, and almost all are lawyers. I have no idea how they used my preferences to pull that one off, especially as I adore brunettes and artists, but hey, who cares?   I'm in contact with one local chick, and I have initiated communication with half a dozen others. And another half a dozen new matches appeared yesterday. Very cool. It's like having your very own Jewish grandmother as a personal matchmaker.

      Cock-sucking, motherfucking, asshole, scumbag, dipshit, fuckwad, needle-dicked, shit-eating, bug-fuckers.  The colorful adjectives above illustrate the true nature of the people who make decisions in the company for which I consult as they have arbitrarily and out of mean spiritedness decided to move my department to a building three miles south of here that has NO connection to the train station. That means that in a few short days or weeks, I will be forced ONCE AGAIN back into my fucking goddamn evil car and will have to ONCE AGAIN slog 45 minutes to an hour-and-a-half each fucking way through horrible, mind-killing traffic. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!  Fucking Suburbanites. That’s who I work for. SUV-driving, McMansion-owning soccer moms and dads. I hope your kids grow up to be crack hoes or anarchists who break your hearts and empty your bank accounts. It will serve you right.  I’ve decided that the whole Suburban Mentality is also a meme—a mind-virus—and these wicked, soulless Suburban automatons are determined to suck me into their web of evil. Soon they’ll have me driving a mini-van, golfing, voting Republican, and going to the Olive Garden in my local strip mall for "gourmet" Italian cuisine.  Fuckers.  Needless to say I am NOT a happy camper right now. At all. Not even a little bit.  I am breathing fire and belching smoke. I am a crock-pot set on a slow burn gradually cooking myself into a fucking rampage. I saw  Office Space  again last night and fully realized that it’s not a comedy; it’s a documentary. Quick, go file your TPS Report.  Time to update my resume. Bastards.  Rant over.  I got a response from Chi Yon yesterday, and yes, she does want to be friends. I’m thrilled. She’s a cool person, and I really like her. It will be fun to hang out with her. And perhaps I’ll get to see her friend Lisa again…  Last night I went to check out High Life Adventures, which is a local activity group here in Chicagoland. More money than God (read over-priced) but there isn’t anything else like it in Chicagoland, and they do have some great activities. One person I know remotely vouched for them, so I decided to sign up. They offer activities almost daily, so there’s no shortage of stuff to do. I figure I’ll get out more, meet folks and make friends, and meet more chicks. Win-win.  Also last night eHarmony sent me yet another loser. You’ll remember that last week they sent me a Jesushead (Click. Delete.) Yesterday’s loser  du jour  was a cop whose photo slideshow was of her in her military fatigues, probably taken in Iraq. And she collects military uniforms and memorabilia, reads military history, and is a WWII Channel junkie. What’s the phrase that immediately comes to mind? LATENT LESBIAN.  If I had wanted to be put in contact with latent lesbians, I would have chosen the send-me-the-latent-lesbians option, but somehow I do not remember selecting that option, so if eHarmony continues to vex me by sending me loser chicks, Jesusheads, or latent lesbians, they will end up on the Rotating Annoyance link on the right sidebar as well as become the recipients of a nastygram voicing my displeasure. Stop pissing me off. Jerks. I’m paying for this, you know.  And besides Army Cop Lesbian Girl, eHarmony sent me three other potentials yesterday. All boring, and none of whom even had pictures posted. Yawn. Click. Delete.  eHarmony needs to do better. I am headed straight into dating ennui. I need a Love Bunny. Soon. But most especially after I'm sentenced to the gulag that is my car.

       Rochelle   I had dinner with Rochelle on Friday night at the Mambo Grill in River North, which is a neighborhood just north of the Loop. River North is very city downtown-ish. Lots of good restaurants, cool shops, and well-dressed pretty people. Not residential at all, but still nice. Chicago continues to charm me.  The Mambo Grill is a self-styled Pan-Hispanic restaurant specializing in creative Cuban and Brazilian cuisine. It’s loud, funky, and cool. And with great food, excellent mojitos, and good service, it’s just my sort of place. Rochelle had picked out the restaurant as I’m still a newbie and don’t know that many places yet. She did good, so I made sure to compliment her on the choice.  As to the date itself, well, it wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t great, either. I ended up carrying most of the conversation as she seemed nervous and way too serious, but I made sure to ask her lots of questions to show interest. That, however, wasn’t particularly successful, as she really didn’t have much to talk about. I ended the date around nine o’clock, we exchanged cards, and I made my escape. If she calls, I’ll be happy to hang out as friends, but I’m not interested in anything romantic. I consider Friday to be further dating practice, and I found a great restaurant to go back to, but I’m not going to pursue anything with her. She’s nice, but no sparks, and we don’t have much in common.   Chi-Yon   Semi-successful. Sort of.  It didn’t start well. I called her from the ‘L’ last night so she could meet me at the Addison station, and she asked if it was okay for her to bring a couple of her friends. I gave her a clipped “yes” since I didn’t want to get into a cell phone conversation on the ‘L’ as to why that WASN’T okay and was in fact a severe breach of dating etiquette, but I was pissed that either she would be so rude and clueless or felt it necessary to have fucking chaperones in a public place where it would be impossible for me to kidnap and murder her if she was worried about me being a psycho. Anyway, I decided to see what would happen and met her at the train station, but as far as I was concerned, she had used up her free pass, and I expected perfect behavior from her for the rest of the night.  Ten minutes later I got off the train, exited the station, and found her waiting on the sidewalk outside with a man and a woman. I introduced myself, offered my hand, and Chi-Yon introduced me to her two friends, Neil and Lisa. The intros complete, we walked to the Northhalsted Market Days street fest in the Halsted neighborhood, also known as “Boystown”. “Boystown”, if you haven’t guessed, is the Chicago’s major gay neighborhood, and Market Days is a big gay festival.  We walked the three blocks or so to the street fest, and about a minute into the stroll, Chi-Yon told me that she had tried to call earlier in the day to ask me about inviting her friends. I’m sure she sensed that I was upset, and she was trying to smooth things. I gave her bonus points for a good recovery, and after that I was able to relax, although it was still basically a blind date, and blind dates are weird by definition.  The Street Fest: LOVED it. I like gay neighborhoods, think gay men are a hoot, and I had a most excellent time hanging out with Chi-Yon and her friends. And I got to see  A Flock of Seagulls , one of my favorite Eighties one-hit-wonders. One disappointment: the  AFOS  lead singer was wearing a baseball cap. The major reason why I wanted to see the band at all was to see the hair. No hair, so I’m assuming that twenty years of rock and roll living has taken its toll, and the lead singer has succumbed to the heartbreak of male pattern baldness, hence the baseball cap. Still, they were good. Much better than I remember them.  Observations: It is now an apparent requirement for all gay men to have gym bodies. Lots of puffed up pecs and washboard abs. If I were a straight female, my panties would have been damp as all of the buff gay boys were shirtless to show off their toned bodies. It makes me want to start lifting weights again. There was, however, a dearth of drag queens. Too bad. I love drag queens. I did see a few Lesbians—majorly scary raging bull dykes—but the Sapphic Sisters were largely absent. Good. Lesbians are way too serious for my taste, Ellen DeGeneres notwithstanding. And thankfully I didn’t get groped since I tend to be gay bait (and I looked gorgeous in my casual designer ensemble last night) but I did get checked out. Chi-Yon even commented on it, and we both had a laugh.  The Date: Chi-Yon and I had no couple’s chemistry whatsoever. I liked her, and I enjoyed hanging out with her, but there wasn’t anything there. I’m pretty sure she felt the same way. Her gorgeous blond best friend Lisa and I DID have chemistry, however, and while I did my very best to focus my attention on Chi-Yon, I was distracted as Lisa and I seemed to be into each other. Had Chi-Yon and I not been on a date, I think Lisa and I would have hooked up. Proving again that if dating had a representative Hindu god, it would be Shiva, the God of Chaos and Discord. Or the Norse god Loki, the trickster god.  End Result: At evening’s end, Lisa shook my hand for a moment too long, said goodbye, gave me a big smile that warmed my heart, and took a cab home. Chi-Yon then walked me back to the ‘L’, we did the obligatory post-date good-byes, and I took the train back to Evanston. It wasn’t a bad night by any means, although it was disappointing since from the emails and our phone date, there initially did seem to be  some  chemistry. Lesson learned: emails and phone dates mean nothing. They’re a good way to screen, but they do not mean that there’s something there. It still all comes down to physical proximity and body language. Several hundred thousand years of mating behavior cannot be replaced by a decade of digital dating rituals.  I did genuinely like Chi-Yon as a person, and I’d like to hang out with her again. I mailed her this morning to tell her that I had a good time, and that I would like to see her as a friend. We’ll see if she’s okay with that. I think she will be since I sensed that she liked me, too, but she didn’t think we were couples material, either.  I’ve temporarily exhausted my eHarmony Potentials, but I’m not too thrilled with eHarmony right now . While eHarmony has screened out the obvious psychos , I’m not having chemistry with any of my matches, and frankly I’m tired of going out on all of these de-facto blind dates leading to nowhere. I’m going to continue to use eHarmony, but more selectively as I focus my energy on meeting women the good, old-fashioned way: in person, in the flesh, everywhere I go.  Girlfriend Quest 2004 continues…

      The Illinois Republican Party pulled off a brilliant coup today by asking Black conservative talk-show host Alan Keyes to spearhead a suicide bomb attack against the handsome and charismatic Barak Obama in the run for the U.S. Senate this fall.  Keyes, who is supposed to be officially unveiled this Sunday in Illinois, is going to be imported from his home in Maryland since the Republicans couldn’t find anyone else from within Illinois who was willing to sacrifice himself on the altar of national politics.  But why is this a brilliant stroke? For several reasons…  The first is that Keyes may—may—split the Black vote enough to actually be able to win. If the Black vote is split, it may produce a Gore-Nader effect like we had in 2000 and suck enough votes away from Obama for Keyes to win. It’s worth a shot.  Second, if Keyes does win, it will give the neocons even more currency within the Illinois Republican Party since they are fed up with the moderates who control the Illinois Republican Party. They have been slowly and carefully infiltrating the upper reaches of the Illinois Republican Party as they have done across the entire national Republican Party. If Keyes wins, one of their own will function as their mouthpiece.  Third: It shows all the Black Folk that the Republicans LOVE them, want their daughters to marry Black men, and that they sincerely don’t feel that black people are a despised minority they wish would just go away or at least function out of sight as cheap labor.  And lastly: The Republicans can’t lose here even if Keyes does get obliterated in November. Keyes is disposable. He’s Black, he’s an outsider, and he’s not an important cog within the political machine. He’s the political equivalent of one of those unmanned drones the CIA occasionally uses to take out those pesky Al-Qaeda types: disposable, low-risk, and highly effective if it reaches its target.  I was going to sit on the sidelines (but still vote) since I figured that Obama had the election locked with Jack Ryan pouting over the fact that it came out for all to see that he’s a hypocritical asshole and lying scumbag, but the Republicans have proven that they are still politically savvy enough to zetz me and force me to become politically active. Expect a phone call from me from the Obama campaign headquarters asking you for your vote.

       Girlfriend Quest 2004 Scorecard…   The Contenders>>  Chi Yon: Americanized Korean Insurance Underwriter, 34 Rochelle: Jewish Cross-Cultural Consultant, 40 Audrey: Non-profit Online Education Manager, 37 Jennifer: Pediatric Resident, 35  Rochelle from eHarmony and I have been emailing each other all week. Friday is our first date (coffee date downtown). Audrey and I were supposed to get together this week for our second date, but neither of us was able to make our schedules mesh. We’re trying to schedule time next week. Chi Yon and I are set to have our first date this Sunday. Chi Yon is my current favorite, although all have been great. I haven’t heard shit from Jennifer for several days, so either her schedule is killing her or she’s more interested in someone else and is keeping me around as a backup. One more chick is in the pipeline (a not-for-profit lawyer). All Active Potentials right now are from eHarmony. The latest crop of New Potentials delivered on Monday, unfortunately, was a bust. Either there were no photos (Click. Delete.), or there was nothing there that peaked my interest. One New Potential from last week turned out to be a Jesushead, and I’m annoyed that eHarmony let her slip by. I SPECIFICALLY mentioned when I was choosing my criteria that I don’t want to date anyone religious. So much for filtering.  This weekend I’ve tasked myself with synching my PDA with my laptop as I’ve already made some almost scheduling fuckups, and if I don’t start keeping track of my dates and contacts, I’m going to really screw myself over in addition to pissing off women who I genuinely like. And no, I do not plan on sleeping with all of them and juggling a harem. That’s too much work, and the goal here is to find ONE woman who I absolutely adore who will apply for and fill the position of Senior Love Bunny.  While eHarmony has been good so far, I am trying to not use them as my sole chick supply. Next Monday I go downtown to sign up for  urlLink Highlife Adventures , which is a Chicagoland social group with oodles of activities going on pretty much every day. A friend of a friend has confirmed that they are indeed worth the money, and that the female to male ratio is 3:1, meaning that unless I am show up sporting a mullet and a NASCAR belt buckle—not a possibility—I will be in like Flynn. The average age range is late-twenties to early-thirties, which means that my parents have a chance to actually become grandparents.  Other Hunting Grounds: The Metra train and Yoga class.  As my loyal readers know, I have escaped the Purgatory of the car for the relative Paradise of commuting to work by the Metra train. Little did I realize when I purchased my train ticket that one of the more pleasant perks of commuting by train besides being happily narcotized by the clickety-clack of steel wheels on steel rails is to be surrounded by gorgeous, young, female flesh. They are everywhere. And  sans  wedding rings, for the most part. What remains to be seen is how amenable they will be to my advances. I know that first thing in the morning, I don’t even want people to look at me let alone talk to me, but I’ve gotten some positive attention from some of the more comely women, possibly because my male competitors rank low on the cool scale and high on the ugly scale. We shall see whether the Metra train turns out to be the Love Train.  Last night’s yoga class was conducted by a new instructor, Ann. STUNNING. All data points indicate that female yoga instructors as a whole are consistently amazingly gorgeous. And flexible. But I’m noticing a trend here: they are as mellow as a herd of stoned Hindu cows. I’m a funny guy, and I’ve gotten more than a few dates by making women laugh, but these chicks…I use my best stuff and get some laughs, but it’s like pulling fucking teeth. They quickly slough off the humor and go back to being all enlightened and mellow and stuff. It’s annoying, and it makes me pine for Ruth who was an obnoxious bitch, but at least she had a personality and some energy. Maybe Ruth should take yoga. The balance would do her some good.  Anyhow, while yoga instructors may not be suitable Potentials, hopefully other female yoga students will be. I will be taking different classes at different times to see which classes have the highest probability of hookups.

      I am now officially a major geek. Why, you ask? Because I have discovered and implemented RSS.  RSS stands for  R eally  S imple  S yndication, and it’s basically a new means to become even more saturated with information. But in a really cool way that will make you the envy of all your tech-savvy friends.  So how does it work? Well, basically you install some sort of RSS newsreader like  urlLink SharpReader  (free) or  urlLink FeedDemon  (not free) and then add content (channels) to it. The RSS newsreader, which basically looks and acts like a combo of a classic newsgroup reader and an email client, automatically (poof!) posts updated content that you can pore over, peruse, or delete. It’s kinda like watching the ticker on CNN Headline News, but from your computer. Sorta.  You can have feeds from CNN, the BBC, your favorite porn sites, whatever, automatically send updated stories and news and such to your newsreader, to your cell phone, to your PDA, to your fridge... How way cool is that?  But what does this have to do with you, Dave? Well, I have RSSd my blog, that’s what, and after you install an RSS reader, you can go to  urlLink Dave's RSS Feed Home Page , and add my RSS feed so you automatically get sent all the latest things that are Dave. You don't have to do a goddamn thing. The feed does all the work.  Once that's done, then go forth and subscribe (gratis) to whatever interesting information that blows your skirt up. Most major web sites have RSS feed links posted on their sites, or you can search from within the newsreader. Check it out. Also see my RSS links on the right sidebar.  So other than the coolness factor, why is this important? Because this is going to be the new paradigm for sharing and obtaining information. In the near future, all information will be filtered and tailored to the individual. No more wasted time having to sit through the sports segment to get to the weather report. Only what you want gets piped into your brain. Now if someone could only come up with a blowjob feed...

      Weekend Update…  Short version: Cheryl arrived Friday afternoon, we had fun, we had lots of amazing porn star sex (the neighbors were surely jealous), and she left this morning to return to San Diego. Life is good. Tired, but good.  Non-sex details: Saturday Cheryl and I went to the  urlLink Chicago Botanic Garden . Disappointing. The CBG isn’t all that interesting as the displays aren’t particularly good or diverse, and the whole thing isn’t much more than a very nicely decorated golf course, not a renowned showcase for flora like  urlLink Longwood Gardens  in Chadd’s Ford, PA. I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised. This is what happens when you have an outdoor space designed by Midwesterners. Uninspiring is the operative word here.  The CBG, besides being a mediocre repository of all things green, seems to be a major wedding destination for those who live outside the bounds of civilization, i.e., outside of Cook County or Chicago. I was fortunate enough to witness the ultimate White Trash wedding, replete with bad tuxes, hideous bridesmaid dresses, poor manners, and buffoonish behavior.  The general rule is that most Chicagolandians get married by age 22. To not do so is to be regarded as a failure. Women attend college here primarily to earn their MRS Degree, and late female adolescence/college life is preoccupied with finding a good catch, settling down, and breeding future generations of Chicagolandians who will further increase suburban sprawl and design poorly constructed botanic gardens.  The CBG wedding I observed confirmed this observation, but also included one dimension heretofore unknown to me. Read on. The punch line awaits.  The Bride, who appeared to be about fourteen years old, was wearing a white polyester dress with a poly veil and plastic tiara that looked like it had just been swiped off the head of a Barbie Doll and enlarged via a Transmogrifier to fit the bride’s pre-adolescent head. Why she was wearing virgin white confused me as given her demeanor, she’s probably been bumping uglies since she was nine. “Like a Virgin” is not a song that will be played by the DJ at the reception.  The Groom, who also appeared to be about fourteen and was probably the bride’s first cousin, was wearing a smashing, poorly-fitting black poly tux with a white vest and white tie, an earring, and about a half a gallon of styling gel on his closely-shorn pate. The image that came to mind was John Travolta in  Saturday Night Fever  meets Al Pacino in  Scarface . Hideous, bordering on fugly.  While I missed the actual wedding, I got the chance to observe the reception— which was being held in the Chicago Botanic Garden’s CAFETERIA . Yes, you guessed it, it was a real CAFETERIA wedding. My first, and hopefully my last. I never expected in my wildest, most surreal dreams that any couple would willingly have their wedding reception in a fucking cafeteria. In Iraq, yes, but not in the U.S. of A above the Mason-Dixon line. We have COLLEGES, for Christ’s sake. We have MUSEUMS. This isn’t Arkansas.  The wedding party, all in their Sunday best—meaning that they were wearing their  dress  cowboy boots—queued up, hoisted aloft plastic cafeteria trays, and piled said plastic trays with potato chips, cole slaw, tuna salad sandwiches, and sodas. Yum. What a feast.  After loading up their trays (I did not see if the guests paid for their own food or not), the wedding guests proceeded to the dining area, plopped their trays on the tables with the rest of us who were simply there to eat our lunch, and dined. I will say that they were well behaved, but that’s probably because alcohol is in short supply at the CBG cafeteria and because they probably couldn’t afford to pay for it, anyway.  I’m still recovering from the horror. I’ve seen plenty of bad weddings, but nothing as lowbrow as this. The only thing missing was the bride having sex with the best man behind the soda dispenser. But maybe I left too early.  So what have I learned from all this? DO NOT leave Cook County. Ever.  And from now on, I won’t have to. Today I started commuting to my job in Suburban Hell by train. My Chicagoland driving days are now officially over. Should I wish, I can take my car and drive it into Lake Michigan. It is as useless as an appendix, as wanted as a case of crabs.  Since Chicago has such fantastic public transportation, driving (and having to deal with the accompanying traffic, impossible parking, rude ASSHOLES, and of course the exorbitant costs of maintaining a car) isn’t necessary . Now that I’ve figured a way to get to work on public transportation, I am completely immune to the tyranny of Suburban Life and I can now heartily enjoy a pure, unadulterated City Boy lifestyle. Huzzah!

      Why do I blog? I blog because I think the concept of recording my thoughts and ramblings for all to see is fascinating. And because it satisfies the exhibitionist in me.  But what is even more intriguing for me is reading the blogs of others. (Hey, I’m self-absorbed, but I still like people and find them really, really interesting.)  Reading others’ blogs isn’t so much an exercise in voyeurism as much as it’s the chance to see alternative points of view and to be exposed to new ideas, which one rarely finds in the corporate media.  One idea that has captured my attention of late is the concept of a “meme”, or mind-virus.  The theory is this: An idea is spread from person to person much like a virus. It seeks reinforcement by trying to control the behavior and thoughts of others, and it seeks replication in the minds of other humans in order to survive. The concept of “freedom” is such an idea. So, then, would be a religion like  urlLink Christianity .  While an individual idea may or may not be meme, the salient point here is that the serious study of the way that information is spread is now upon us. Research is ongoing, and rising stars in meme research are starting to emerge. Research at this point has been mostly conducted on blogs and web-sites as anything posted on the Internet can be tracked, meaning that it’s possible to quantify the data, dissect the data into tasty little bits, and then come to conclusions. Who knows? Maybe at some point, savants will be able to forecast how and where a meme will spread like a grove of tech-savvy Druids.  One intrepid researcher who has tackled investigating how memes spread is  urlLink San Arbesman . Sam created  urlLink The Memespread Project  and launched a meme into the blogosphere and tracked its progress. Check it out. Additional rigorous research into the spread of information via the web is being done by the  urlLink Hewlett Packard Information Dynamics Lab . The HP Information Dynamics Lab has papers online, and has even created a  urlLink Blog Epidemic Analyzer . Intriguing to say the least.  A short decade ago, Science Fiction author William Gibson forecast that in the future, information itself would be a form of currency, and those who controlled information access would have the real power. I think he was right, and with the study of Information Dynamics, ideas themselves will be studied, picked apart, re-written, and eventually controlled like any other commodity. How this will be done (not if) in a supposed free society will determine our future—and our freedom.
