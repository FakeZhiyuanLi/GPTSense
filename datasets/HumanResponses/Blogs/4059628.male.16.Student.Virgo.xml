      Just what I've already told you....I just have a simple life living in a complex social structure. I'm like this: Waking up at 5:30 in the morning to watch Magandang Umaga ng Bayan&nbsp;and&nbsp;read the&nbsp;flash reports and zysygy. After that I go to the bathroom to take a cold shower, then prepare my uniform and pick up my bag to start anohter episode of my life. Things change, but not for me. I already gave up everything just to find something unusual for me. I am already fed up with the usual things people doesn't even consider to look after. For me people with ordinary lives will not reach the maximum point of The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility or they already shut down their lives while making their way to the&nbsp;top. Many people are like this, but I'm not. People always looked at me beyond their usual perspective. I reckon them, just with a little thanks...after that, I'm ready to start my engine to drive myself where my feet wants to go.

      I'm just a simple, fun-loving type of person. I just go around the campus and sometimes look for a place which makes me comfortable. I also make myself busy with a lot of things....especially academics, which for me, places a high value in my agenda. But wait! I'm not the type of a nerdy=nerdy=geeky person as you may thought. Of course,there's a little bit of time to satisfy my hunger......Eating! and Debating with some other guys....especially Paulo, my worst enemy (in argumentation!) and another Paolo, our soon to be Summa Cum Laude.  My life, I should say, is nothing more a bit exciting. For me, life is just a state where you can experience the extremes in your life. Yeah, for sure it's a little bit mushy but let's accept the fact that life's like this. No one knows, I may become the future CEO of Globe Telecommunications Company or in another perspective, I may become just a little, scrawny boy you can see in the middle of the street waiting for jeepney drivers to buy my cigarettes and pungent menthol candies.(Haler!)  Okay, let me stop myself blubbering around here. I am making no sense at all! But anyway, just to make you a bit excited, I will get this end for the moment. Wait for further postings and announcements about myself and my interpersonal daily activities......Chiao!

      Well, another day has passed...And since it's our Preliminary Examination Period let me give you insights of what had happen.  Of course, a day began with a journey to school. And since Tuesday was the lucky day for our much awaited Examination, it was undeniably the easiest of all the test series.  It all started with History particularly Asian Civilization. You're right! History! as in H-I-S-T-O-R-Y which requires us to do a lot of mental works and tuning. And not just a simple tune-up. Imagine, lets say the coverage of exam is from Chapter 3 to Chapter 7, and that would result to roughly 100 ++ pages plus tons of photocopied handouts!We have to study it (memorize!) for just a couple of hours! Holy ****!Whatta! Anyway....pass is passed. I accept the fact that I will only get roughly half of the total score...Poor me!  Computer comes next. Although this one didn't require us to peruse our notes, yeah stock knowledge will do, our Professor somewhat made the exam a bit complicated.Think of this, there is a part in the exam which requires us to find errors in HTML tags. If the given tag is correct, we must put a smiley before the number, otherwise we must put an X mark. Okay, there's no problem there.But the funny thing would be the positioning of the syntax or codes of HTML. IT WAS ALL SCATTERED! and RUMBLED! Of course, you might think that majority of my answers are X,well...you're right!   Thank God! after all the pains and sufferings brought to me by the latter subjects which I suppose were the easiest ones, Mathematics seemed to be my savior. After I got a 94% grade, (that means I got 14 correct answers out of 16 questions) it made me feel that I should be proud of myself for having a grade higher than 90%!(the highest that I got prior to Prelims is 90). Hayyyy!  And the last part....   The Inferno......to be continued
