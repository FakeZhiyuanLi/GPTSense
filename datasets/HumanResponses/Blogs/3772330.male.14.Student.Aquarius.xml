           i slept really late last night, went to bed at like.. 2.30. then i woke up 5 hours later and heard two cars crash. i was like   lmao. i got up and looked out the window and looked around. i didn't see no cars crashin. i looked at my dad's car and it's alarm went off. and another car on another block's alarm went off too. that was freaky. and there wasn't anything wrong with them. no dents or anything and they were really far apart. really freaky. then i tried to go back to sleep. i slept from 8-10.30. my mom was screamin coz she was late to work.. that woke me up. probably on her period lol. then i went back to sleep..  again  till like 2. hehe..       i really didn't do anything much today since i'm on summer vacation. just the usual of everything i do after school. chattin on aim, listenin to music, and tryna fix the blog's skin >.  but now we can chat like b4...
