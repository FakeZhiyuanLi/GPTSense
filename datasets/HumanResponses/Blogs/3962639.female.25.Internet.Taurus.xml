      &nbsp;&nbsp; Oh...... Look,&nbsp; its Mid Fucking year evaluation time.&nbsp; that's right! ...The goddamned Monkey on your back is ready to give you the 411 on what he&nbsp;/ she ( I prefer Horses Ass) considers your net worth to the Company.&nbsp;  How pathetic!.... shiiiiiiiiit .... Let me just roll the clock back ... To 10:30 am&nbsp; July 21, 2004.&nbsp; Place: &nbsp;some where in the corporate world of Commercial Services . Who: a small fat&nbsp;MotherFucker ... (to&nbsp;those who dare speak of it ...aka my boss) sits adjacent to me watching&nbsp;Eight&nbsp;hours of&nbsp; damn golf&nbsp; while intercepting&nbsp;inbound sales calls and munching on MY&nbsp;DAMN PRETZELS&nbsp;( hope the spit tastes good to yah bro !)His Pastime: talking cash shit with his fucking home boy and BAP.&nbsp; How Great........Mrs ... BAP or as I like to call her ..Magoo( Bitch&nbsp; can't see without her coke bottle glasses or astigmatism contacts... Constantly whines his name about 30 or more times a day Daaaaaaaannnnny!.....Fucking Great ... What a goddamned circus. Now I am told I have a mid year revue ....I feel my temper rising as he gleefully takes magoo back and she emerges all smiles .... ( keep in mind all week this mother fucker quoted good things come to good people ... (do they have a saying for evil doers like me. I wonder?)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well now its my turn ... I fucking sitting there and he points a stubby crooked finger at my quota numbers ... Speaking very quickly and sharply .. Stating this is what counted the most.&nbsp; Then he stated some more bull shit as he flips over the page.&nbsp; I couldn't believe&nbsp; ME  fucking eyes...... !!!!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Truth be known I swear I sprouted horns and a goddamned tail .... As my words soared out now in reverse: kcuf eht tahw for those who are of a holy background that is what the fuck ... I Couldn't believe what I was reading .. Me .. A fucking training mogul, damn doormat for all,&nbsp;.. Was now reading that I wasn't capable of communicating with others ....... Yes ... Others ...(I guess those Account Execs...That I trained and Telesales Reps oh and don't let me forget the Managers referred to me for training ooooh ... And even my horses ass of a boss comes to me to answer questions don't count. My eyes ... Now slits .... Read feverishly on .... NOT A TEAM PLAYER, CAN'T GET ALONG WITH OTHERS,&nbsp;as this Son of A Bitch mockingly whispers ... Look at me not at that paper.&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;I know&nbsp;at that moment .. Fire flew from ass and propelled me forward in the hard uncomfortable piece of shit called a chair.....And I&nbsp;expressed my&nbsp;heated&nbsp;&nbsp;opinion and let me tell ya it was hot in there... I bet &nbsp;people&nbsp;walking by were&nbsp;scorched&nbsp;and could possilby&nbsp;still be rolling around trying to put out the flames. I stated I would not sign off on that piece of shit for all the fucking money in the world..( however I could be persuaded if it included a group of small spider monkeys shooting from his ass ).&nbsp;&nbsp;I was so fucking pissed I took the rest of the damn day off drank goddamned rum and ... Took a long goddamned shower ... (to wash the bull shit off ).....People the Workaholic is in and taking fucking names .... grrrrrrrrrr!
