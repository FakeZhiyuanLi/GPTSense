      By the way...What is this stuff we jokingly call health care anyway?  Get the irony in this.  I am a high-risk labor and delivery RN (love my job! Really!) and my insurance through my (LARGE) teaching hospital does not cover infertility treatments.  EVEN when they are due to a medical condition (like endometriosis).  If I went to work at the local potato/corn chip factory, it would be covered...Up to THREE cycles of IVF!  I can take care of people who can have these treatments and those who have mortgaged, second-mortgaged, sold the tractor, sold the house, sold the cars and bought one used car, but don't ask to have the treatments for yourself!  (now this will sound a bit bitter)  I can even take care of the moms who have used drugs, alcohol, never went to the doctor, smoked, ate fast food every meal of every day, took all the wrong over-the-counter medicines, and come to the hospital at three A.M. complaining of a backache they had last week so they can get an ultrasound and find out the sex of the baby (haha...jokes on you...we don't tell that!) driven by their drunk boyfriend (who is not the father of this baby-duh!)and STILL hope for the best for them and their baby.  (By the way, did you know they come at 3 AM because the bars stopped serving at 1 and the boyfriends finished their last drink in the comfort of the bar until 2, drove home, and then had to drive the girlfriend to the hospital. Cafeteria's open guys...I suggest coffee.)  What do you think?  Is a career change in order?

      This time I started bleeding a minimal amount (as I always do) yesterday.  The funny thing was that I didn't call  my doctor, didn't go in for ultrasound, didn't schedule my first OB appointment until after the date I miscarried last time, and I beat myself up for telling my Mom after my husband advised me to wait (?!?!).  Could this be denial?    Nah, couldn't be.  I know the score.  After all, I am on my fifth time pregnant (with no baby yet)  Yeah, yeah...I'm calling the doctor first thing in the AM.   Mom and Aunt Dayle are visiting the Vortex in Sedona tomorrow....maybe they could bottle some positive spiritual energy and bring it home to me.  Oh yeah...to tell you the amount of hope I am feeling....I scheduled an appointment with a therapist on the morning of my first OB appointment for this pregnancy.  Guess I'll need it for another reason now...  Best thing that happened today?  Found all these blog sites and laughed my butt off at all these incredibly witty, hurting, finding their own solutions, WOMEN!
