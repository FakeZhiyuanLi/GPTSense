						    From the movin' 'n' shakin' department...   I got the blog set up to publish over at  urlLink the CPS web server  instead of on blogspot. We don't have anything against blogspot, mind you -- it's just kind of nice to have our content sitting on our server.  Oooo, and if you've got a feed reader (until recently, I guess they were called RSS readers) you can subscribe to the dispatches here:  urlLink http://www.coprosperitysphere.com/dispatches/atom.xml   If you've got a Mac, try the beta of  urlLink NetNewsWire , which does support Atom format files.

						   Today we:       Did huge masses of laundry. Washed so much laundry, a veritable Kilimanjaro of laundry was done.  Made buckets, I say, buckets! of amazingly delicious red sauce and put it all in the freezer.  Met the neighbors across the back fence.  Squeezed a quart and a half of lemon juice.  Shopped for groceries.  Fixed bicycles.  Washed dishes.  Slacked.  Mocked opera. Why can't these people die, already?!  Played Fluxx with our kid.

						   I have a dream about keeping bees. I'd like to start out with five. A big one, two medium-sized ones, and a small one. That's five. And every day, when I wanted to put honey in my tea, I would take one of the bees from his little beepartment in the Sucrets box I keep them in, and I would sqeeze him into my cup. I don't like a whole lot of honey.   One day, I would open the box and there would be seven bees instead of five. And then I'd have to re-think things.   Bees are very particular about their space. Each bee needs his own little space. Some bees like to put posters of their favorite film stars up in their little beepartments. Some like to put up their sports heroes.   Some paint the insides of their beepartments black and sit inside even on nice spring days and listen to Morrissey. They are the depressed bees who think that nobody understands them. You've seen them. They're huge and fat and buzz around buildings. They're called mason bees, but that's usually only once they've hit middle age and someone's sponsored them into the lodge.  Some bees tell you how beautiful you are and entice you with drink and smooth talk and then don't call and then show up at the same club three months later hanging all over your best friend like stank on a ho. They are the drones and they are usually impotent. They're really not worth getting worked up over.  Some bees are queen bees. They have a lot of babies. Their babies are the princess bees, and their fuzz shows like gold against the rich brown of their sculpted little bodies, just like Princess Stephanie of Monaco.   I like bees.

						   I cook. Which is to say that I take one bunch of things and, through the magic of chemistry, make them into one big mass of something else and expect other people to destroy the evidence of said alchemy by eating it.   When I was a kid, even though it was the seventies and women were all busy smoking Virginia Slims and wearing "Little Prunes" (betcha forgot about them, didn't you?) and Looking for Mr. Goodbar, I was still expected to take home economics where I would learn how to cook and sew and do laundry and care for children. Even the ugly girls like me were expected  to know those things, even though it was also a foregone conclusion that we would be living with our parents for the rest of our lives and never need them.   Cooking at my house was a survival thing. There were four children and only one parent in our household - an unfavorable ratio at best, and a formula for "Lord of the Flies" at worst. We children were expected to cook the meals at dinner once we were old enough to reach the stove, and you could only make so much macaroni and cheese before mom blew her stack.   Something happened, though, over the years. I got good at cooking. It was passable at first, but I was encouraged by my successes. The first was my late high school/early college boyfriend who tasted my tempura and then went home to tell his mother about it, only to have her try to duplicate my rice flour/iced club soda recipe with buckwheat flour and lukewarm beer.   My second success was my first husband. This "success" was made easy by the fact that his mother was arguably the worst cook on the planet. Apparently his father had told her "one day, all food will come in pill form and it will taste  exactly like this ." How he could taste it is anyone's guess, as everyone in the entire household, including the the aged corgi, chain smoked unfiltered cigarettes. The furniture was covered in plastic that was amber and sticky with years of accumulated tar. In those days, all of my cooking skills were directed at just making something the poor man could taste.   My second husband was also impressed by my culinary abilities. Again, I have his mother to thank. The poor woman was allergic to wheat, and so he had to endure things like the cake she made out of rice flour that was so dry that he couldn't unpucker for days. He drank endless glasses of water, only to have them turn to glue in his mouth. I don't think he used the bathroom for more than a month. This is the same woman who found out that cucumbers are hard to pull off as a vegetable side dish when shredded and boiled. I don't think she had a recipe. This was entirely a brainwave on her part.  What really spurred my culinary creativity, though, was my third husband. This was a man who absolutely scorned vegetables of any sort, and who also inspired the sort of contempt that made the marriage the blessedly short-lived thing that it was. I created vegetarian masterpieces, purely out of spite. Every night at our house was a vegan dream, lived out by a carnivore in purgatory.   So, all those years of training have paid off. The ugly chick has made good, the years of cooking to overcome the handicaps of others are behind me, and I'm currently married to a vegan who eats like there's no tomorrow and who never met a vegetable he didn't like. No, I don't make spite chops or hot roast vengeance. I'd like to think that, as my cooking skills have evolved, so have my interpersonal skills.   Then again, I have so many bodies in my wake that argue against both of those things.

						   I have always wanted to like cats. Cool people like cats. Edward Gorey likes cats.  I can't think of anyone else that I admire offhand who likes cats.   People who like cats consider themselves cool. The collective species of cat-lovers has developed an entire mythos around cats that says that they are mysterious and noble and intelligent. They talk about themselves in relation to their cats the way that career servants talk about their bosses.   Cat fanciers like to think that cats are aloof and discerning in their choice of companions, so the fact that the cat that lives in their household chooses to show affection to them means that they are somehow special or accepted into that cat's tribe.   BARF. That entire notion just makes me want to barf.   In an effort to like cats, I have kept cats for the last eighteen years, and I don't like them any better now than I did when I started.   My first cat was given to me by a former boyfriend. This guy made me promise that I would always keep this cat safe and make sure he had a good home. True to my word, this cat is still alive and in relatively good health. He lives with my mother who called me up about six or seven years after I had received this cat and said "You still hate your cat, right? I was thinking about getting a cat and I figured if you still hated yours I could just take him and you'd give me all his stuff, too." I was over there in under half an hour with the cat and hundreds of dollars' worth of cat accessories in tow.  I was under the impression that perhaps in order to really enjoy cat ownership one had to possess the right accessories. Like, to really enjoy my computer I've bought speakers and a different mouse and a lot of cool software.   There are very few things that one can purchase at a pet store to make cats more entertaining. The best thing I've found to make cats more entertaining is a couple of gin & tonics, but those are for me, and after that, even the goldfish are good for a giggle.   I will never understand the sort of people who say that cats are intelligent. Granted, if you put a cat into a position where it has to get around, into, or behind something in order to get something else, it might actually do that. But it's just as likely that the cat will walk halfway across the room from its challenging puzzle and proceed to lick its own ass.   And for every stupid behavior cats display, cat fanciers have come up with some sort of anthropomorphic explanation that makes the cat sound really intelligent and cool.    Cat ignores you completely   cat fancier opinon:  he's aloof and doesn't feel obligated to show his affection if he doesn't feel like it  another possibility:  he's stupid and either hasn't noticed that you're in the room or has already forgotten   Cat turns up his nose at his food   cat fancier opinion:  he's finicky and knows the difference between "good" and "bad" food  another possibility:  he's not that hungry   Cat spends all day licking himself   cat fancier opinion:  he's fastidious and keeps himself clean and well-groomed  another possibility:  he's rolled all over the floor and thinks that floor crud tastes good - at least better than that dry kibble shit you've been feeding him   Cat spends all day laying in a sunny spot   cat fancier opinion:  he's luxuriating in his catness  another possibility:  he's the laziest sack of crap on the planet   Cat catches a lizard and brings you half   cat fancier opinion:  he's trying to curry favor with you by sharing his kill with you  another possibility:  he's full and you just happened to be around when he dropped the other half   I can't romanticize them. They smell gross, they're untrainable and some of them look as though they've been hit in the face with a cricket bat.   But I'm told they taste like chicken, so there might be a use for them yet.

						   Okay. I now have a new blog. I'm not yet sure what differentiates this from my other blog, except that only YOU know about it. Nobody else.   So...it's exclusive and stuff. I'm sure you feel really special.   When I have time, I'll tell you about myself. Or I'll tell you about the person I want you to think I am. Or about the person I think I am when I'm deluding myself that I'm someone people want to know about.   But for now, I'll be content with this small amount of verbage.

						   Pirate Guillermo and I had grand and glorious plans for this weekend. We were going to give our entire house a makeover, write the great American novel, tote that barge, lift that bale, etc.   That was shot to hell when we didn't get our sorry butts out of bed until 11 (8:45 if you adjust for the fact that we got up at five and spent until about 7:15 taking Peaches to the airport and getting her on a plane). And after a tiny breakfast, we realized that we could make the early showing of "Troy."   I felt cheated that I had actually read all of The Iliad for this. Granted, I had a good working knowledge of Achilles, Odysseus, Menelaus, Agammemnon, Hector, etc., which did help. On the minus side, it was an entirely different story that had nothing to do with the Iliad at all. The first line in the credits said it all: " Inspired by  Homer's The Iliad." Not even "based on." Only inspired by. Probably by the name, mostly.   The movie was amazing with my favorite being the battle scenes. Just as I anticipated, there were guys getting it in the neck with spears, instances where the spear went in under the jaw, through the tongue and out the eye (well, they didn't show it in  that  much detail), at least one guy got it in the nipple.   It made me realize that there was a time when men fought with honor and dignity. Back before they had invented pants. I think it's because they were all really, really self-conscious about the fact that they either looked like they were just out of the shower or like girls (the hair didn't help), and so they felt they had to fight even more fiercely.   Case in point: Petroklas, cousin of Achilles. Don't let it bother you that in the book he was older than Achilles - they were still best buddies. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out where I'd seen him before, and I finally realized that he was the drummer for the GoGos all during the '80s. Glad to see he stopped wearing all that eyeliner. He's so self-conscious about looking like an escapee from Hansen that he spends every scene that he's in begging "Put me in, coach! C'mon! I wanna play too," and like every wussy crybaby first-time player, he ends up getting killed his first time out.   It was informative to see the difference between the men's long lounging skirts and their short pleated battle skirts. I'm guessing that the idea is to frighten their enemies with the sight of their mighty, hairy, sweaty thighs. One sight of those thighs and anyone might have second thoughts about getting near that army.   The only difference between the kings and the warriors was girth. The smaller warriors are very stringy and tough-looking. The larger ones are like armored meat. Imagine an entire side of beef wearing leather armor and carrying a spear. That was the first guy that we saw Achilles face off with. Minus the leather armor.   Then there were the kings, who all looked as though they were less "dressed" than "encased." They were all big, rotund, giant men who were made to look even more "kingly" (read: gargantuan) by studding their leather armor with all manner of very butch-looking little studs and buttons. With the penchant for pigtails, the whole effect was...like watching a combination gay pride parade and war counsel. Only these guys took themselves WAAAAYYYYYY too seriously. I saw no chorus lines, no "pull my finger and watch my skirt flap," and nobody asked if this armor made him look fat. Although, for that last one, I guess you don't need to ask if you already know the answer.  At the end of the day, even the novel plot, the silly costumes, the even sillier acting, and the hairy thighs couldn't disguise the fact that it was really a good movie. I can hardly wait for the video!

						   Peaches is off to Tennessee starting on Saturday, and the BabyGoddess is going to be at her dad's for the next three weekends in a row. Whatever shall we do with ourselves with no babies in the house?  Usually, Aoibheall gets all misty and starts saying, "I miss the babies," about 5 minutes after they're gone. But how pathetic am I that I miss them already?  Well. Mom's gonna work on stuff, and I'm going to take care of all the junk and things. Like cleaning the fish tank and weeding in the garden. Oh, and we were going to clean out the garage, and take some stuff down from the attic...  Yep, that's right. When the kids disappear, Mom and Guys really live it up: they do chores.

						   Yesterday, I trimmed the grape vines back. They're still kinda wild and hairy looking, but they're not grabbing onto the hammock any more. There are also many more grape clusters on them this year than there've ever been on them before. I guess grapes must  like  being hacked back to sticks. Anyway, I harvested several leaves from the vines I trimmed and used them to make dolmas. The hardest part is the rolling. The filling comes together very quickly -- fry up some onions and rice, add in some spices and nuts and you're good to go -- but scooping a bit onto a leaf and then rolling it all up is time consuming. That's how come dolmas cost so much at the deli, in case you were wondering. It's a manual process all the way.  And, while this manual process was going on, we dithered about what to have for dinner. Ultimately, we decided to thaw out some of the amazing sauce Aoibheall made, cook up some pasta, and let the Babygoddess make garlic bread. She loves doing that, and chants, "Squunch! Squunch!" as she spreads the garlic butter around. All spatulas are now called squunchers.  It feels really good to make food out of ingredients we grew in the back yard. The grape leaves and the herbs were picked fresh right before I made the stuffing. Doing this helps me feel connected to the world. When the kids see dinner, they know that it grew in the dirt. They probably helped water it or pick it or  squoonch  it. They don't think that food comes from the store and it grows in cans. Food comes from the garden and it's made of ingredients. Which are my favorite.

						   This past weekend, a whole passel of folks came up to visit. In part it was just an opportunity to visit, and in part it was an opportunity to get my geologist uncle to look over the new house.  I spent Monday morning with the Realtor&reg; down at the  urlLink Santa Cruz County  offices, poring over old geological reports and building permits. We found out that the retaining walls above the house and the gabion wall along the creek were well-constructed and that it's a lot cheaper to get the permits first rather than just to start building stuff and get the permits after you've been fined.  We're excited about the house. We're working on getting all the bits and pieces squared away. Jeez, we still need to pack stuff up. At least PoppaPirate says he'll host the website at his place once we move (no really good broadband solution up in the mountains, I'm afraid). All we really need now is flood insurance.  And we need to be sure that the current tenant takes his deer with him.

						   We're going to be moving.  There are now a million things we'll need to take care of. Geologist's report, flood insurance, movers, packing, unpacking...but all that is in the future. Right now, this minute, we are just happy. No more uncertainty about the offer, no more waiting and wondering. We know. We're going to be paying rent to the bank, now, instead of to the landlord.  And we got the house!

						   I'm spending some vacation time in Hell and was wondering why all the newspapers down here are in Russian. What's  that  about?   So, I've gotten a crew together and started working on Hell's first English-language daily. The "Tarnation Picayune" will begin printing in August (just before the summer rush!) with a full complement of news.   The front page will have basically Earthly news. Really, there's no need for a change there. Everyone on the front page of an Earthly newspaper is either going to hell in a handbasket or has recently been delivered there. Our first day's headline will note that due to worldwide recession, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are being laid off and replaced with George W. Bush, who has been doing their job single-handedly for some time.   The local news section will let you know what's going on in Hell's many Circles. In addition to the endless coverage of local politics (since we seem to be a bit top-heavy, management-wise), we're devoting one page to each Circle, to give it more of a "neighborhood" feel. We're also including a new "Hot Spots" section with places to go on those Friday nights when you're tired of hanging around the tar pits.   Sports coverage here is going to be HUGE! We've got so many pro athletes that it's like every all-star team you've ever dreamed of! And the lovely thing is that it's always summer here. All of you ice-hockey fans had better hope for seats in the upper Circles. We've got a game pretty much every day, but since this is Hell, I can tell you right now that your team is going to lose at the very last minute on a bad call. Those are the breaks.  The Lifestyle section should be a big hit with newcomers. You'll be able to find out how to treat 3rd-degree burns with baking soda and what sort of ointment will heal those severed limbs. We'll also highlight some of Hell's various communities with columns like "Suicide Success Stories" and "The Priesthood Didn't Prepare Me For This." This being Hell, we've replaced the pages of comics with a full page of Daily Puns!   The Want Ads in Hell are a little different than you'd expect. It's mostly about time-share swapping. Things like "Wanted: trade a week in level three (pelted with rain and hail) for a week in level seven (showered with eternal fire), particulars negotiable."   I'm excited at the prospect of the biggest newspaper Hell's ever seen! There are delivery problems (the papers on level two tend to get blown off people's porches) and the matter of procuring materials and income, but I really think that we'll have a lot of popular support, after all, we have all the highlights of the press for the last millenium right here!

						      So, last night I canned seven pints of pickle relish. That's the way to take cucumbers with us! I've also been canning tomatoes as they come ripe. Sure, it's great to have them in salads and on sandwiches, but we've got some very enthusiastic tomato vines. Going back to store tomatoes after the homegrown ones run out is always rough.     The new house is out in the boonies. So far, I haven't gotten anyone to admit that DSL is available there. I don't know how we're going to get online from home. Downgrade to dialup? Revert to the days of UUCP?  shudder . This weekend, I'm driving the server down to the Mathemagician's, where it'll live and be happy. Depending on the broadband situation in the mountains, I may look into starting up a bandwidth co-op.     The new house has a septic tank; it's not on a municipal sewer system. This means that we're all going to have to adjust our water use. I think it's all going to be fine, but it will be an exercise in education.
