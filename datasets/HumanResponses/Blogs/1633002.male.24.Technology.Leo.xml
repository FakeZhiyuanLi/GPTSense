      I'm going to try to post a Master Shake Quote Generator I found.  I don't know if it's going to work, but i'll give it a try.     Eh, it looks a little crappy, but it's too big to fit in the column the other way, so DEAL WITH IT.    Oh yeah, if you want to see something else he says, reload the page.  Have fun....

      Hello to all of my loyal readers.  All 0 of you.  ;-)  This weekend was pretty eventful.  Friday I was exhausted from work and I didnt do much, and I had to get up early saturday because I was visiting Laura in the middle of the CAM (Cycle Across Maryland).  I'm very proud of her, during the weekend she rode her bike over 100 miles, about 115 I think.  Thats hella work.  So, i went to visit her in Emmitsburg, MD, right near the MD/PA state line.  It was a fun time, and I enjoyed my first ever trip to  urlLink Cracker Barrel .  The food was good, except for the green beans which were smelly like vomit.  HAHAHA that's a joke that only my friend Josh Schuman will get, and a few other people.  Sorry about that.  I won't do that again. (by "I won't do that again", i mean "I will probably do that again later, not the same quote, but something that not everybody will understand, so thank you for your patience").    Sunday I spent the day with my parents, and I had a nice time.  I got to grill some steaks and chicken and we ate outside because it was nice.   I also watched "Badder Santa" which was funny as H - E double hockeysticks.  I must part ways with this dumb computer, as it is time to leave.    Talk to you later,  With all the Dirtiest Love, Scott

      I've been working at  urlLink Information Management Services Inc.  for about a year now.   When I first started working here, I did a fairly simple project for a scholarly journal publication. I think it was for the national journal of cancer, or something, I'm not sure.  Yesterday, I get an e-mail that says I need to revise the map because one of the census tract figures arent correct.    If you don't know what a census tract is, it's how each county in the US is divided by the US census.  There are hundreds of divisions per county.  It is even smaller than zip code areas.  Anyway, I had to figure out what was wrong with the map and it has given me a major headache.  Its not just any headache either, its one of those headaches like if I woke up feeling' like this, I would just run toward the nearest living thing and kill it.  More later....

      That really sums up my day in a witty rhyming heading.  Here it is in detail.  Today was a coworker's presentation at  urlLink The NCI  today.  We are part of a group called  urlLink GISSIG , or GIS Special Interest Group.  Every month someone gives a GIS related presentation, and it was our job this time.  We had a few months to prepare.  On friday we tested the computers and made sure they could work with our demo software that we had written.  Today when we got to our presentation, the computer crashed of course, and we couldn't do our demo.  At least we still had the powerpoint presentation.  The second half of the headline refers to my lunch.     Yum!

      Hello everyone,     I know it's been a few days since i've been able to write, but that's because I was staying with my parents for the weekend to celebrate fathers day.  It was fun.  We went grocery shopping and my mom paid for all of my groceries.  It was very nice of her.  Also, Fla-vor-ice is  my new favorite food.   I think I had about 30 of them this weekend.      Something funny happened when we went grocery shopping.  My  mom got pissed at the cashier/bagger person at Magruders because she packed the eclairs that my mom bought sideways in the bag, and they got chocolate all over the box and they squished together.   She went back into the store and got them to replace the box, and we drove home.  As she was getting out of the car, she dropped the box.   HAHAH. It splattered worse then the ones that the bagger messed up.  I also was readying dork monthly, (my computer magazine), and found out about a real neat new software by the makers of kazaa, that is a VoIP program. It's called  urlLink Skype .  VoIP, for those of you who don't know is Voice over IP, or a way to make phone calls over the internet.  It is supposed to sound better than your regular telephone, and its free.  There's another product called a  urlLink SIPphone  and it does the same thing, but the neat thing is you can buy a telephone that connects directly to your router.  No computer required for it.    I am such a nerd.

      You really shouldn't, because it's not that shocking, I just wanted a line that would pull you in.  I did get startled this morning in my office by a loud noise.  Here's how it all went down....  So I'm just sitting here minding my own buisness, listening to my iPod, and programming an update to  urlLink Headbang!  (a statistics smoothing algorithm), and I hear a loud crashing or banging noise.    You see, I am on the 3rd floor of my office building, so if I hear a crash, I expect it to be  inside  the building, so I look to my right, towards the door.  I see nothing, and then as I am looking to the left (out the window), I see a tiny Mexican man floating out my window.  I jumped a little, and tried to play it off by waving to him.  Maybe I don't know how to wave in spanish, but he completely ignored me.  He was even looking right at me.   He just went on about his buisness cleaning my window.    I also have to mention that he did a shitty job of it, because i can still see bird crap on it.

      So I graduated from college over a year ago now, and I'm still living in the house that I was living in for my last year of college.    For reference, here it is (covered in snow):    This was a very bad idea.  "Why was that a bad idea Scott?", you might ask.  Well, living in a house with 6 other people is a chore in itself... some of the people in this house make my chore a little bit harder, but everyone living here has some sort of chore.  I'll have to explain some of the other people's chores for mine to make sense.      Some people in the house have the arduous task of protecting the other inhabitants of the house from sitting on the couches.   I know they work very hard to accomplish this.  It takes many many hours of covering the entire couche (3 of them), with their bodies, and sometimes blankets, for 23 hours a day.  When they are not protecting other house residents and guests, the couches still remain safe because during their daily shifts, they don't have time to shower to give the couches that extra protective coating, for when they are not on-duty.  The hour spent off-duty is not to sleep however, they do serve another purpose in the house.    Being the curtious folks that they are, they are always looking for different ways to help out everyone else.  On the one hour that they have off-duty from the couches, they are nice enough to (mind you, this is on their time off) put their own health on the line, and test everybody elses food for poison.  Their meticulous process to test for all types of harmful, cancer causing, particles on our food, is to eat most or all of it, and then see what happens.  We sure are lucky that they haven't found anything yet that could be harmful to us. I can't speak for the others in the house, but me personally, I am very thankful for their thoughtfullness.  Its also a nice feeling to wake up in the morning, and find strangers on the couches, taking over for the people who needed some time off.  It just shows that they care.    Don't get me wrong, it's only a select few that are this way.  Everyone else in the house has different chores.  My chores, are almost the oposite of the previously noted chores. My chore is to spend as much time in my room with the door closed, protecting the house from collapsing.  You see, the door to my room is a major part of the house's foundation.   In order to keep the house structurally sound, i need to keep the door closed.  Also, the air that I breathe in my room is the only thing keeping the second floor from colapsing down into the first floor.  In order to keep the room filled with breath-air, i have to keep my door closed and locked whenever i am not here, to prevent air leakage.  It's tough, but i'm committed.  If everything goes as planned, i'm moving out August 1, when my lease is up.  I'll miss this place......

      It definately goes without saying that  urlLink Aqua Teen Hunger Force  is the greatest show since sliced bread.  Well, maybe since  urlLink Family Guy  went off the air.  The show is about 3 food products, a milkshake, a pack of french fries, and a meatwad (not a meatball, he's not cooked).  They used to solve crimes in the earlier episodes, but now they pretty much stay at home (in New Jersey, because everybody knows New Jersey sucks).  Anyways, watch it on cartoon network weeknights at midnight.  There are 2 episodes back to back, but they are short (about 15 minutes) so watch both.

      Okay, i have to be a nerd for a minute....   urlLink Gmail  - Gmail is different. Here's what you need to know.  Haha, i was suprised this morning to recieve a Gmail.com invitation.  It's still only in beta testing.  It's a webmail program but you get 1gigabyte, or 1000megabytes of e-mail storage.  If you don't know how big that is, just look at  urlLink Hotmail , it only gives you 2mb storage....  Cheap Micro$oft bastards.  Also  urlLink Yahoo Mail , which used to give you 6mb, has upped their space to 100mb to try to appeal to make more competition for Gmail.... good luck.  Nobody will probably read this, but if you do, and you want a gmail address, i have another invitation to be a beta tester.

      Hello all you out there in internet land.    Here's a rap: (to the tune of ice ice baby)  Alright, STOP,  Deficate and Whistle, I'm back like a patriot missle, SHIFT,  I'm only screwed up slightly, flow like a piss stream daily and nightly, will I ever stop,  yo... probably will, turn out the lights, and I take a nasty spill, to the foot cream I rock a bike wearing sandals, ride up a bump and hurt myself on the handles.  Ok, that's enough rap.  On a different note, regretfully, I have some bad news.... according to an anonymous commenter, I'm  urlLink "smellier than a hobo's nutsack" .  That's pretty freakin' smelly.  I'm sorry.   I'll try to wash better.  If I have offended anyone, I am truly sorry.

      Well, my 24th came and went.  It was a great time.   I got some nifty new stuff.  Laura got me an AWESOME watch.  There's no picture online of it... I looked so I could show you all.  Trust me, its the hotness.  She also got in engraved with a nice message on the back.   I got a leather briefcase from my parents, and with the birthday money I got, I bought a  urlLink TiVo .  I havent gotten to play with it that much yet, but it seems pretty cool.  I also went to the podiatrist today to fix my ingrown toenail.  It hurt more than 8 bitches on a bitch boat.  (That's a lot)  I hope it heals soon.  It still hurts.  :(  AC/DC kicks ass.

      So I haven't been writing for a while.  I'm not sure if that just means I have less to complain about...  Don't get me wrong, I'm a happy guy, it's just that certain things/people make me mad.    I don't tolerate much with people.  I either like you or I don't.  There's no in-between.  And just as a heads up, I don't like most people.  If there's any doubt in your mind as to my feelings towards you, I DON'T LIKE YOU.  I'm sorry.  That's just me.  I'm also sorry for yelling.  I didn't really yell, I just typed in capital letters.  I'm thirsty, brb.   Ok I'm back.  Damn waterfountain...    Anyway, I finished reading "Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them" by Al Frankin, and it was pretty good for the most part.  Some of it was a little bit boring though.  I also finished reading "Big Fish" by Daniel Wallace (yes, it's the book the movie was based off of).  It was not as good as the movie.  It was kinda sucky actually.  Now I'm going to read the DaVinci Code.  I know i'm being on this, but WHATEVER DUDE, WHATEVER.  Oh yeah, my birthday is tomorrow.  I'll be 24.  That's freakin old.  Well, wish my a happy one. I'd do the same for you (if I like you that is)

      Market Research groups, you see, are the greatest invention EVER.  At least for people like myself.  You sign up with one of these companies, and they call you to participate in research studies, and pay you exorbitant amounts for a short amount of time.  They usually pay anywhere from $50-$100 an hour..... AN HOUR i said.  I figure, get a few of these a day, I'll be set for life.  I had one of these last thursday, and then one today, and I am making like $185 for 3 hours.  That's nuts.  And not just any nuts, they are pistaccios, the BEST nuts of all.  Also, I am taking sick leave from work to go and participate, so I'm also making my salary over-top of these rates.  mmmm... free money....

      Hello all you non-readers....  Anyway,  I'm getting ready to start moving my things home.  I'm not sure when i'll actually move out though.  I have started to move a few things, but most of my stuff is too big to move.  For those of you that don't know, I'm forced to move back in with my parents.  Although I don't mind doing that, I will have restricted freedoms.  On the other side, I will be living in a place much better than I could afford (at this moment), I will be able to save up a lot of money, and I will be able to pay off my  urlLink car  much quicker.  Once that's paid off, i'm going to have an extra $350 or $400 a month.  That'll be nice.  If anyone has a big van or truck I can use to move, please let me know... hahah  I'll probably have to rent something.  As for the cell phone, I recently switched carriers.  For a long time I was an advocate of  urlLink T-mobile  and I had been a member since the time that they were still called  urlLink VoiceStream Wireless .  The reason I was a fan was because they had very large rate plans for a relatively low price, and I liked their selection of phones.  Motorola phones have been my favorite for a few years now.  Two days ago, I decided to switch to  urlLink Verizon Wireless  because of their well known strong signal strength, and for their In-Network calling.  They also have good signal at the beach, which T-mobile did not.  I got a new LG Phone (see below) because it was pretty inexpensive, and didn't have a camera.  I HATE camera phones.  It makes the phone bulky and heavier, and takes crappy pictures.  If you want a digital camera, buy one, and get a cheaper phone.  And, people who take pictures with their phones are douchebags.  Yes, i'm talking to  you  douchebag.

      The one in church has  hope  in her  soul .    Get it?  Think about it a little longer....   SOAP  in her  HOLE !   That's funny right?  You might not think it is, but that is because you are dumb.  If you still don't get it, refer to Appenix A.  So I can't wait for the long weekend.   I'm going to relax tomorrow night, and then go to a 3rd of July BBBQ, the extra 'B' is for BYOBB.  What's  that  extra 'B' for?  It's a typo.  That should prove to be fun times for all.  Then I'm gonna go watch the fireworks in downtown, no not DC, but good ol' Rockville.  Sounds like a super weekend of fun.  We'll see though.... We'll see....  Today one of my curtious roomates was watching the television in the main room of the house (right next to my room) at FULL volume.  I'm not joking.  I went out and I said, "What the hell" and he said "What?" and i said "can you turn the freakin tv down", and he turned it down to  VERY LOUD .  He must be somewhat deaf.  It was rediculous.  I couldn't hear the tv in my own room.    Speaking of, I think i'm going to move all my stuff from that room out of the house.  Maybe the roomates won't be so annoying if they aren't using my stuff.    Have I ever mentioned that I can't wait to move out?    Until next time, This is me, Signing off.

      When will this damn move ever end?  I think never.  And i'd be right.  It seems like i have most of my stuff, but then when I look again, SO much stuff is left to move.  I may take a day off work to finish moving.  I just want it to be over with.  I have to go back to the hell-pit(house) today to move more stuff.  I'm going to try to get all of the things except the furniture.  I hope i can get them all.  NICE.  I had a presentation to give at work on monday, and I think I did pretty well for my first time.  The people over at the Rockville office didn't have much to say, because they really don't know all that we are doing with GIS here in Silver Spring.  I think I'm getting a raise soon too, which would rock like a hurricaine (not like one of those wussy storms).     [Listening to: 03 - Rollover DJ - Jet - Get Born (3:15)]

      As I am writing this, I'm sitting in my parents room in my parents house, watching my parents TV.  If you don't get the hints from the previous sentence,  I have moved most of my stuff home.  Yes, that's right, I'm moving back in with my parents for at least a little while.  We'll see how that works out...  haha.  If they start to bug me, i'm gonna sleep in my car until I find a place.   The wireless network SUCKS in the house, so I keep getting disconnected.  I have to move the router.  It's in the corner of the house upstairs.  It has to be there at least until Laura(sister) goes to college (Yes, I know she has the same name as Laura(girlfriend), and if you think it's the same person, you are a SICKO).    So anyway, I'm here and I'm glad to be able to start paying off my car quickly.  Then I can start saving an extra $475 a month, and that will kick a donkey's ass.  That's the best kind of ass to be kicked.  Um, I was gonna write something about politics, but I'm done with this for now.
