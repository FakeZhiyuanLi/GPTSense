        My birthday has passed. It was a fast day. I woke up at around 11am or so. Holly, Mary and Gavin had went out to the store to pick up a few things to make cake with. Mary also went to the chiropractor (I think). Meanwhile I did almost nothing. I turned on my computer to get some work done, and ended up checking my email, editing a few   urlLink  RSCDS    things, and drooling over online pictures of the   urlLink  unaffordable guitars    that I want. Mmmmm. One day. When the fam arrived, I headed downstairs. Gavin was passed out in his moms arms and went directly upstairs to finish his nap. We lounged for a little bit while eating Brie and Safeway French bread. Not a bad breakfast if you ask me. Then Mary started on the blissful cake. Since she was busy and concentrating so hard, Holly and I thought we would head upstairs and spend some quality birthday time together in our quality birthday suits. He he. It was a good afternoon. This now brings us to about 2:30ish PM. Holly and I eventually moseyed back downstairs. Shortly thereafter, Gavin woke up from his nap and starting immediately being cute. We decided on some filet mignon for dinner with potatoes and salad. While I got a little bit of work done upstairs, Holly brought me a small taste of wonderful icing from the cake. It was going to be awesome. It didn't take long before dinner was ready. I believe it was around 3:15ish PM. The meal was great. So yummy. Afterwards, I was sung the traditional "Happy Birthday" song while the cake was carried out with seven candles on it. Two on one side, five on the other. Thus 25. Directly after eating the yummy cake, I opened my small pile of presents. First was a little bottle of tequila with an Agave worm in it (actually I opened that one earlier in the day, but didn't want to go back and edit all this text). Next I opened the present from Gavin. A very beautiful journal with the cover designed after the "Book of Kells". Next was the present from my Grandma Mc. She sent me a package the previous week, which I held off on opening until "the day". It's a good thing I did because my father informed me that it had an auto self destruct mechanism on it if it were to be tampered with prior to the 29th. This gift turned out to be a very soft stuffed Snoopy (very soft) with a lovely card and a box of chocolates. Next opened turned out to be a pedometer. Cool. A good simple gift to help with my running. Lastly I opened the one they told me to open last. I sort of knew what it was, but didn't know. If that makes any sense. It was a Rio brand sport mp3 player. This I can clip on to my short and use it on my runs. As it turns out, it is also great for being at work alone at 3 am while switching commercials on films and adding and removing trailers. On the downside, I got a few strange looks from people as I was leaving totally forgetting that I should not sing out loud when other people are around. A great gift. Now that the gifts are all opened and it was 4:30 PM, I ran upstairs to prepare to be at work. At the same time downloading songs to my mp3 player to take to work. I was very late to work. I was supposed to be there at 5pm, but due to my excitement over the mp3 player and the fact that I had to stop at Koolau (theatre across the street) to get some change, I didn't arrive at work (half and hour away at Aikahi) until 5:35PM. From there I preceded to work until 3 AM or so. That was my day. I crashed as soon as I got home and had a good nights sleep. I'm 25 years old. 1/3 of my life down. Maybe less, maybe more.

       Here I am at work again. It is a slow day. 18 People so far. Oh well. It is an easy day. I have spent it doing email. I emailed Jeannie. I completely forgot her birthday was earlier this month. I am tired today. I went for another run this morning. I'm pretty sure it is a two mile run. It was super hot too. I didn't go running until 11:30am. Nice and hot. So I drank lots of fluid. A good run though. I have been working like crazy on the KarateDepot stuff. The new site is finally coming along. It won't be long now. I have also been working like crazy at the theatre. The other manager is on vacation so I am working like 5-6 days a week. Grrr. Plus I have to come in on my day off to do the movie schedule, 'cause the other manager does not know how. Grrr. Plus I have to work on my birthday.   Ok, so I don't know how much of this is repeat of my previous blogs, but too bad. There is not too much else exciting in my life. I suppose that is not really true. It is just hard to think about other things than work when you are at work. I'll try though.   Ok, (5 minute pause while I try to think about something other than work)... I have created a new web site for myself. You can see at the top of the page the links to the different sections. Unfortunately I have not added new work yet. Same old stuff. I will update it one of these days. But if you feel like checking out the design, just click  urlLink HERE , or on the "Home" link at the top of the page. I think it looks pretty cool. Something I did add though, are some writings I have recently done. And I don't mean blog. Some "poetry" if you want to call it that. Songs even some of them.   Ok, this is getting a bit long. I will stop for now. Unless I think of something else. But then I will just put it in another blog. If anyone reads this and wants to ask me questions, wants me to write about something in particular, or just want to say "Hi, I read this crap" leave me a comment. I will read it. Ok then, till next time...

       I started on Tues the 13th of July. I rounded up 15 of the best painters I could find (15 volunteers), purchased 11 gallons of paint, and started to rip apart our theatre. It is still not finished yet. I still have to touch up all the trim and put back some of the wall hangings, but it looks way better. Take a look at what the theatre used to look like before it's miraculous transformation (maybe miraculous is a bit dramatic).                   So that was the old Aikahi. In the near future I will take pictures of the new Aikahi and post them. Stay tuned...

        I have customized my blog a little bit. I hope you enjoy it. Yes, I am working again. Holly just showed me a picture of the gross maggot eaten&nbsp;roaches that we found in a wine bottle of our recycling. Yum Yum. I will be done with work soon, just in time for dinner. Then I must head off to the theatre to work some more. Yay. Thursday is my birthday. I have to work then too. Oh well. I look forward to Gordon Biersch on Saturday.   I have been running again. Scottish dancing let out for the summer so I thought I would take up some more exercising. What cheaper way to exercise than to run, right? So I bought some running shoes and off I go. It has been going good. I got caught up on home and work projects for a little bit and put off the running, but now that things are slowing down, I am getting back on track. The course I like to run is just over 2 miles. Not a bad workout. When my body gets more used to the running, I will run a longer course. But for now, this is enough.   I played music last night at Gabe's house. It seems that every week we sound better and better. At least I like to think so. I bought a new amp for my guitar a few weeks back and it has made a great difference. Yesterday I hooked my mic in through it as well as my guitar, and it sounds great. Better than I could have imagined. My voice is clear (is that really a good thing?) and sounds like I am in a concert hall. We have about 6 or so original songs that I actually like. It's cool. Monday nights at Gabe's is such bliss. I love music. One day I will get to go back to school for music. The theatre will actually pay for my classes if I were to attend full time. But when do I have time for that with the schedule they give me? Oh well. At least I have Monday nights. It has taught me so much about music and playing with others. It was definitely a step in the right direction for my music. We think that starting 2005 we will look for some gigs. We will be ready by then.   Time for me to continue my day in the real world. Which is just as well. Till next time...

        I decided after lots of thinking that I might as well create a blog for myself. I do tons of writing anyay. I think better in text form. As some people know, when it comes to verbally expressing myself, it is easier to get thoughts out of the head of those sea monkeys that come in the little capuses. You know. The ones that you put in water and watch them grow. They are basically little sea creature shaped sponges. Anyway. We will see how this works. Most of my posts will probably be typed at work. Since that is where I am 80% of the time. Because of this, I also miss all the fun stuff at home. If you have read   urlLink  Holly's blog   &nbsp;lately, you will know what I'm talking about.   Thursday is my birthday. I have to work that day (go figure). I will spend the day working for Karatedepot in the morning, opening presents and eating cake in the afternoon, then dreadfully drag my but to Aikahi theatre where I will spend the last&nbsp;10 hours of my day. Oh well. At least I might have some presents that I can take with me to play with. Who knows. I recieced a present in the mail today from my grandmother (Mc). I recieved a gift from my other grandmother a few days ago. We will see what they are on thursday. I think the highlight of my birthday will not be on Thursday though. On the following Saturday, since I do not have to work, we will be heading over to Honolulu to go to   urlLink  Gordon Biersch   . This is a brewery resaurant. This will be my first time there. Although it is certainly not the first time I will be drinking thier beer. Gordon Biersch is now my favorite beer. They make a few different kinds of beer, all varying in taste and flavor, Marzan being my favorite. Yum Yum.   I hope you enjoyed my first post. I am now going to deposit our money in the bank and head on home to get some sleep. I will wake up tomorrow refreshed and ready for my run. I will discuss this in another post. G'night.

        Good evening. It's Thursday night and naturally I'm at work. I am waiting for the Coca-Cola guy to come fix out Coke machine. I must also call the air-conditioning people tomorrow because it is like 85○ in here. So hot. By the way, for any sick o's out there. When I hoped that the movie yesterday wasn't dirty, I meant it literally. The movie is 2 years old and the film was all covered in dust and scratches. I needed to run it through a cleaner. Although it still is full of scratches. It was actually a very cute movie. The little 8 year old was such a cute little boy. Very serious and smart. Not a bad movie at all. It is a Spanish movie with English subtitles and is only 1 1/2 hours long. A good story though. A little sad, a little funny, a little emotional and a bit rustic. I think it is based on a true story. Not sure. Anyway, I think I would recommend it. Anyway, I must go. Coke guy will be here shortly. Bye bye.

        Yay! Our old decrepid theatre is finally breaking out of the world of 32K modems and into the world of DSL. I just received a package in the mail from Verizon containing a DSL modem and a DSL instalation kit. Finally. ???? That was strange. I just got a phone call. When I picked up I was chatting with a two year old. Lots of babble about mommy an daddy and another room. There were "Hi's" and "hello's" and something about tv. In the background I heard an adult. I think his mom. After a few minutes I heard, "what are you doing? Oh, you're on the phone". Scramble scramble. Then she picked up the phone. "Hello?" So I anwered. She told me that her two year old son apparently picked up the phone and dialed some number. I told her that it was ok and her son sounded really cute. How funny. At least he dialed within the state. I think. I should have asked. Oh well. It was funny. Gavin will be that age soon. This kid had a slightly larger vocabulary that Gavin. Not much though. I'm at work by-the-way. The last movie gets out in 15 minutes. Then I get to preview a movie called Valentin. It is a spanish movie. Came out in 2002. I don't know why we got it now. I hope it is good since I have to watch it. It seemed awfully dirty. I hope there is nothing wrong with it. Either way, it will be easier to enjoy it while sipping Minute Maid Yellow Lite Lemonade. Mmmm. We got rid of our Pink Lemonade for it. And soon we are tossing the Root Beer for Iced Tea. Speaking of which, I must get the list of available types of iced tea. Good night all.

        Sometimes I wonder. Mostly when I am really tired and bored. There are so many things to think about in life. I don't know how people do it. I try to take things on day at a time. Sometimes that does not work. Right now I am really tired. I have about 1/2 hour until the last movie gets out and all my paperwork is done for the night. There is probably more I could do, but I'm a little burnt out. I have been working abour 40 hours a week at the theatre and about 20 or so hours for KarateDepot. I am really glad for my blog, my monday night music and the new journal that Holly got me for my birthday. They have all been really great at helping me keep some sanity lately. I have been working so much and doing other things like organizing our Scottish dance weekend in February, that I feel that I don't get to see Holly and Gavin enough. And when I do get to see them, we end up spending the time cleaning or doing launery or finishing house projects. It is really frustrating. The past 2 or 3 days since my birthday were nice because I got to spend some time with them. Mostly just sitting around playing with Gavin and talking to Holly. Which is great. That is part of the reason Gordon Biersch was so great. It was the most worry free night that I have had and got to spend with Holly, Gavin and Mary. Such a relaxing evening. Totally stress free evening. Now I am back to work desperatly missing being at home. Sigh. Tomorrow is my day off from the theatre, so if I can get my KarateDepot done before 1:30PM we can all go to the pool. That will be good.

        I had a great night last night. I have been super exciting all week to go to Gordon Biersch. While relaxing all day yesterday, I received about 15 calls from my boss at the theatre. Apparently the person who was supposed to cover the shift that night while the other manager is away on vacation got sick. He was unable to com in to work. So naturally they wanted me to do it. NO WAY. I took an official paid vacation day off so I could celebrate my birthday. Their second option was to call in the manager who was on her 3 week vacation to work. Mind you she is on an unpaid vacation. She was on a neighboring island. I gave instructions to my boss, and made him go over to my theatre and run the shift. Serves him right. Anywho. Now that I had been all wound up over work it was time to drink good beer. So we went to Gordon Biersch. Gordon Biersch has become my favorite beer. Next to Guinness. It is a Brewery/Restaurant. We got there abouts 5:15 PM or so. We knew we wanted beer and their famous garlic fries, but didn't really know what to eat. After much agonizing, we decided to just get the pupu platter. It came with calamari, chicken wings and BBQ ribs. Then of course we ordered the garlic fries. Gavin ate a small plate of spaghetti with butter. Yummy. Holly was our DD for the night, so Mary and I ordered us some beer. Mary the Marzan and Dunkless for myself, while Holly ordered their home brewed, unlimited refills Root Beer. It was really good. Over the course of the evening I learned a few things. 1 - My new favorite beer is the Gordon Biersch Dunkless. 2 - Banana does not go well in a beer. 3 - Our waiter graduated from North Rockland High School and had an uncle who owned the deli that I ordered from everyday on the way to Rockland Lake. Among the beers I tried was their Seasonal Beer. It was a blend of a fresh brewed lighter beer and bananas. A very odd flavor for a beer. Not one I would recommend. Gavin was wonderful all night of course. He played with the crayons that they gave him and drew all over his placemat, which happened to also be his menu. Oops. Holly seemed to be very happy. She took Gavin around the area to see different shops, statues and boats. I think she really like how I became very loose and casual. Being a little more confident I think. Anywho, It was a really good night and I enjoyed it tremendously. Such a great experience. Plus, I talked to the waiter about my little two person band and told him what kind of music we play and so forth. He told me that if we were to get one more band member, either another guitarist or a bass player, that there was a darn good chance that Gordon Biersch would book us for a gig. How cool would that be. So my night was complete. Some really great beer, super good chicken wings, told that there is a good chance to get a gig, a wonderful night with Holly, Gavin and Mary and a fun night out on the town. I can't say how much of a good time I had. If anyone who reads this comes to visit me, you can bet your butt that I would bring you to Gordon Biersch. Oh yeah.

        If you haven't heard of it, there is a movie that came out July 6th called "Some Kind Of Monster". It is a limited release documentary about Metallica. It was first released in only California and NY. Now it is playing in 36 states across the country. Hawaii is not one of them. Being that I work at a movie theatre, I took it upon myself to find the correct emails and phone numbers needed to bring this movie to Hawaii so I can watch it. First I emailed our company film booker. He told me that we can't get the movie until the films distributor sets a Hawaii release date. So I went to the   urlLink  IFC Films    (film distributor for the movie) website. I found just a general email address that I sent an email to. They gave me the phone number for their film booker. Very cool. But I could not get a hold of him. No matter when I called, no answer. I left a few messages on his machine, but he did not call me back. Instead I received an email from a different person from IFC Films. I guess someone got my message. Anyway, I chatted with him a little and gave him some information about my theatre. He informed me that his is currently working with our company to get a Hawaii release date for "Some Kind of Monster". He said that when he finalized a date, he would call me and let me know. This was on Tuesday. He also told me that if I did not hear from him by Friday (today) to call him the following week. If they did not finalize a date by the time I called him, he said, him and I would pick one. How cool is that. I am the reason that this movie is going to play in Hawaii. I am so excited. Not only do I get to watch "Some Kind Of Monster" over and over and over and over again, I am responsible for it. Not to mention that it might even come to my theatre and not one of our other theatres. I am so excited. This alone has made it worth working here. By the way, I have not heard from him yet. I am going to call him Monday morning and find out what is up. Hopefully they settled on a date. We will see. Either way, when the movie gets here, I am going to get my picture taken under the marquee at the theatre and send it to Metallica with a letter.... What do you mean I'm obsessed?

        It was a short wait. This morning Holly got the sign. Not pregnant. Somewhat disappointed about that. But it is better this way. Holly can go to school, get her teeth done, and stay on her diet. All is well. Besides, Gavin is perfect. So there it is. We knew this is how it would end. We are just worry warts.

        So it is Tuesday. It has been a few days since my last post. A few things have happened since then. Holly has joined Weight Watchers Online. She is quite thrilled about it and spends time planning yummy dinners and setting out here food schedule for the day. It is a little game with her. "If I walk around the mall with my mom for 30 minutes, I earn an extra 2 points." That's good. She has lost 2 pounds so far. She went to the dentist today. This is the first of 4 visits which will result in a root canal. Poor thing. While getting ready for work the other day, she says to me, "I don't want to worry you or anything, but my thingy (period) hasn't started yet. Have a nice day at work". It wasn't quite like that, but close. I have to say, having another baby would be quite inconvenient right now. Holly would take an extra semester or two to finish her schooling. We would have to switch rooms with Mary to have extra space for another bed. One that Gavin can have. It's getting to be time for him to have his own bed. Expenses of course. New car seat and what not. Although not thinking about those things (after all, it is not like we couldn't handle it) I think it would be great to have another baby. Life really is good right now. I am enjoying it. But what would we call it? With our luck it will be another boy. I really want a girl. We'll see.

        I spent the day today with my son, Gavin. Holly and Mary went off to their orientation for school today. So Gavin and I hung around the house and enjoyed each others company. I was really fun spending a large block of time with him. It is not something I get to do often. But that is going to change. Holly received her schedule of classes at orientation. Classes start this Monday the 23rd. She has classes Monday afternoon, Tuesday night and Thursday night. So I get those nights with Gavin, not work. I'm excited about it, although the other manager at the theatre will not be. This means she will have to work the dreadful Thursday night shift. It is inventory night, payroll night, and also the night we set up everything for the new movie on Friday. This includes building a movie (or two), breaking down a movie (or two), changing the lens on the projectors, changing posters, and changing any old commercials or previews. It is a long night. Sometimes getting out at 4am. She doesn't like it. So my schedule will almost completely change. I don't mind. I might have to give up Wednesday night dancing though. It is going to be a busy semester for all of us. At the same time Holly is in school, so will Mary be. Mary has classes on different days than Holly, except Thursdays. They are the same. I don't know quite how it will all work out, but I look forward to all the results. Holly and Mary will have their degree, and I will get to spend plenty of time with my boy. Hooray.
