      WOW! I have never studied so much in my life. I'm writing in here because everyone has been telling me to relax and take a break, so I am doing just that. English down, Chemistry, Algebra, History, and Spanish to go! Only goin to school tomorrow for 2 hours, so I guess that's a plus. Oh, Gabby, you kinda disappeared when I was givin you that band list, so if you look at this, here it is: WARPED TOUR 1208 Alexisonfire Alkaline Trio Allister All Rights Reserved Amber Pacific Anatomy of A Ghost Another Damn Dissapointment Anti-Flag The Aquabats Arkham ASG Atmosphere Audio Karate Autopilot Off Avenged Sevenfold Bad Religion The Beautiful Mistake Big D and the Kids Billy Talent Blackfire Bleed the Dream Brazil Break Dance Vietnam Break the Silence The Briggs Bouncing Souls Boys Night Out The Casualties Chronic Future The Code Codie Coheed and Cambria The Commercials Crowned King Don't Look Down Die Hunns Dynamite Boy Early Man The Early November Eight Fingers Down The Erks The Eyeliners A Faith Called Chaos Fall Out Boy Fighting Jacks Flogging Molly From Autumn to Ashes From First to Last The F Ups Go Betty Go The God Awfuls Good Charlotte Guttermouth Happy Campers Hazen Street Hidden in Plain View H Is Orange The Hurt Process Hurry Up Offense IMA Robot In So Far The (International) Noise Conspiracy Jackson Jersey Jessy Moss Juliette & the Licks Keg The Kinison Lakeside Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards Left Alone Letter Kills Lennon Lillix Lordz of Brooklyn Lylah Madison Mae Matchbook Romance The Matches Melee Minority Montys Fan Club Motion City Soundtrack Much the Same My Chemical Romance New Found Glory Non Phixion NOFX Northstar Only Crime Opiate 4 the Masses Oreon O're The Ramparts Over It The Phenomenauts Piebald Pipedown Planet Smashers Plans for Revenge Potluck Pulley The Q The Red West Reeve Oliver The Revolution Smile Rise Against Rolling Blackouts Rose Hill Drive Rufio Saosin Senses Fail Shiner Massive Side 67 The Silence Silverstein Simple Plan Single Frame Slowdance The Snakes, The Cross, The Crown The Sounds Spell Toronto Split Sense Stars Hide Fire Straight Outta Junior High Stole Your Woman Story of the Year Suffocate Faster Sugarcult The Swear Taking Back Sunday Thicker Than Thieves A Thorn For Every Heart Thursday Thought Riot Tiger Army The Tossers Trophy Scars Truth in Fiction Underminded Unit F Van Stone The Vandals Victory Within Wanted Dead Washington Social Club Windsor The Working Title Yellowcard Yesterday's Rising ZOX  AIGHT, C YA LATER

      ...today I devoted my entire day to studying, mainly for chemistry. I also squeezed in a soccer game that really sucked. We lost. YES, this is true. I, justin, lost at something. I know you are truly devastated, but you will get over it. Anyway, I was so busy today that I didn't even edit any papers! It feels odd...My total revenue still stands at $4,876. Darn, I really wanted more. Oh, and just so you know, my little blog things are going to be very short. I'm only doing this because several people have said I must. So there you go. I am great and you are not. That is what happened today...
