          its less than 8 hours before i board the plane to cairo egypt. i'm having this mixture of feeling...sad, melancholic,excited and anxious. Its my first time..so i'm not sure what to expect..but one thing i'm sure of. those hairy egyptian man are as horny as an asshole can ever be..i mean..i've worked with a couple of them before but that's another story..  anyways...i feel pretty bad about leaving my better half here by himself. i mean, i know he's gonna be fine and stuff but i just feel bad cause he has never left me all alone...the most we've been without each other is about a week..so this two week trip without him pretty much sucks!!   i feel crummy cause it's his graduation which means a lot to both of us..and i can't even be there..instead i'm on a vacation..how bad a girlfren am i?    hang on..

              My girlfriend is on the way to Egypt as I write this...      For the next two weeks, I'll be in state of total lost and confusion. Every two months or so she would go somewhere for a vacation while i'm trying to bust my ass off to earn cash. Can't blame her though, the parents rich. And I'm just a very-late scholar phasing through mid life crisis... =P      Each time when she goes somewhere i would be like,   What am i supposed to do now??   Who am i supposed to go out with??      Then the whole idea struck,    If she's going somewhere for a vacation,  WHY DON'T I JUST GO SOMEPLACE ELSE TOO?!        I was lucky enough that my boss gave me RM300  (until today i still don't know why he gave me the money, i was in a hang over back then... thanks, dude!)  I made myself a passport and decided to go to Thailand the end of the month.      Hehe... Thailand, anyone?

           Midnight...    Sometimes you seem so lost   when you're 25   and you don't have a decent job   when you're earning   just enough till the end of the day...   when you're girlfriend's mom   think you're too late   when every job interview turned you down           Midnight...    sometimes you're lost   and you want to go back home   and pray to Him   it seemed like a long time...       Midnight    and then some..          You don't have to even understand   It's just midnight...    *wink
