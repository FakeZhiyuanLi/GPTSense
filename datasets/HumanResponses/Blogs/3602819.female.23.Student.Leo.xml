      Here I am found but completely lost. Those who know me know that I have a tendency to act like I have everything figured out all the while I am trying to figure things out. Before I had a boyfriend I thought to myself....why don't I have a boyfriend I know how to love afterall I have the greatest teacher of love in my life--Jesus. I would think to myself that I would be the best girlfriend. But then I get a boyfriend and I feel like an infant stumbling to walk. Many bruises, many scrapes. I am left with the discovery that this is one area that I just don't know crap about. I guess you don't really discover how totally selfish you can be unitl you are knee deep in trying to love someone and be loved by them. I just wish there was a button to push that would automatically assert God's ability to love unselfishly onto me. So what is something that you thought you had figured out but realized you didn't. Any thoughts on love?

						   Love? So many people talk about it today... I love my shoes. I love my dogs. I love that song. I love my dad and mom. I love my boyfriend (of 2 days... Not really me... More so everyone in high school and under). So what does it mean? I was pondering this (among many things) today. We are a culture that is bloated with love... Retaining all of the "love" we have, but we never have any place to get rid of it, because we don't know how, so we just remain bloated. In the Greek language, there are 3 words for love... THREE! We only have one. We have to emphasize what love really is... "No man, I   LOVE   you..." Okay... That's all for today. Just pondering on the vast greatness of God, wondering how He can LOVE us so much, while we don't even understand what true love really is... Questions? Comments? Good jokes? Bring it on... LOVE!!!!

						   So in my last post, there were so many things going in on in my head, at such a late hour, I don't know what I'm suppose to think now. As I was in church this morning, there was this overwhelming feeling that came over me, actually, two. The first would be the sermon, which was on fathers, and our Eternal Father... How He is perfect. It made me reflect on the kind of man my dad is... One of a kind. He truly is one of the greatest men to walk this earth, and I think that may be why I'm still single. When you have a dad that is as awesome as mine is, it's hard to settle for anything less that... Loving, kind, compassionate, generous... He really is the best dad in the whole world.  The other feeling that came over me was the love and acceptance I have with my church family. As much as I miss my Dadoo and Mom-o and brothers... Not to mention the rest of my family, the feelings I had about not staying in this area for much longer, slowly dwindled away into the abyss. It also had to do with "my kids" at the church. They are all so lovable, and I don't know what I would do if I didn't have those kids to teach, love on and spend time with. To anyone who reads this, and doesn't work with kids... Start now! They will teach you so much about unconditional love and acceptance, not to mention how to be honest and laugh at yourself (yes Sam, I'm talking about you beautiful!). So there is my speel tonight. I hope all are doing well. May the Lord bless you and keep you in His love for eternity, I'm out...

						   Okay, so these thoughts are not all too deep... At least not at the moment. It's late, I have laundry to fold, and I'm on here flogging because I'm addicted to the stupid computer. (wow... Where did that come from?) today I took one of my students to see the new Harry potter movie... I highly suggest those who have not seen it, should! It's a fun, fantasy movie that young and old can enjoy... Together even! Then, after the wonderful movie, I went to our church picnic (what was Rising Sun Christian Church is now Rockingham Christian Church). Words cannot express how blessed I am to have a church family like Rockingham. The people are so friendly, loving and fun to be around. There are times when I really don't know what I'm doing here in New England. I love this area, and I love my church family, but at times... I don't know if this is where God has me for the rest of my life. I wish that would be the case, but I have to be honest with myself. I think God will be changing my plans sooner than I think.... Maybe not for another year or so, but I don't know. I just get that feeling that God is working in ways I cannot imagine, and that is going to lead me down a road less traveled. although I love it here in new England, and would prefer to stay here for the rest of my life... God has been working. I can't explain what I really mean by thing, but it's something I know. The only unusual thing about it, is that when I've felt this before, I knew where God was taking me... That was New England! I don't know... Maybe I'm just getting antsy because I don't know what God has in store for me after school... My hope and prayer would be to work in Boston in a medical office where I can make the biggest impact. Boston is a city I love, and a place I can see myself in for a long time to come. But one of life's greatest questions for a Christian has always been "okay Lord... What are You going to have me do next?" For me... That question is what I'm posing to Him a lot lately. I just hope my prayers coincide with what the Lord wants me to do.... He is good, He is faithful, and He will never let me down! Love you all!

						   So today I took my 5th set of finals in the short (yet ever so long feeling) program that I am in (which, by the way, I wouldn't recommend to ANYONE because of the lack of organization, as well as administration). When I walked into class, it was tense as usual for the reasons of final exams. Then in came the teacher... With some papers that we had done as part of a group project (pairs of students actually). She tossed the papers on the desk and told the class how bad the projects were (my words, not hers... I'm making it nicer than it actually was). Now here is the reason for the big hoop-lah... She said we did not finish the assignment because we left blanks on the papers. (Hee Hee... This is where it gets funny). This is the clinical basis for medical assisting... So it's taking the medical history, family history, vitals and so on. When we were given the assignment, we were told not to write anything that were not in the guidelines for the project. Her reasons: we wouldn't make up any information or sign the patients name, so why do it in the assignment. Guess what?!?! (oh this is great!) the ENTIRE class who didn't write it, or forge the signature, got marked off because of it... Yup... I LOVE IT! so anyway... That's by beef for tonight. At times it makes me really want to yell, scream and carry on for people going back on their word. But then (once again) I'm reminded that I do that SO often. God is constantly teaching me about my flaws. The verse of the day that really hit home... It's the one about removing the log from my eye before I remove the speck of dust from another's...  well... I'm out. As my greatly missed roommate would say... Peace in the Middle-East~ MellieL

						   Today I was driving in the truck (my truck has a name... It's Joey) with my friend Shannon, who is out for the summer, spending time with her dad and step-mom. We started talking about great books we would like to read, and she brought up a book I haven't picked up in years... In fact, since my missions class in college (that would be freshman year). It's called "Rich Christians." We started chatting about what kind of society we live in today and the luxuries we have, when not two conversations before we were talking about the new clothes we wanted, or how we have so little money... (I actually don't have a lot of money, but I'm in school so I knew that was going to happen). But we got on the subject of being homeless... Which at times, I feel that is what I am. I don't have a permanent place to call my own, and because of the blessings of others, I am able to live and work and eat and worship where God wants me to be. But in this conversation, it brought to my attention of how selfish I am with the things I have, with the things I want, and with the things God has given me as a blessing.  Although the Son of Man had no where to rest His head at night, he did no worrying. God's Word tells us of the lilies of the field and the sparrow, and how God takes care of them... But there are so many times when I don't take my heavenly Father's blessing into account... I have it all... A family who loves me, friends who care about me, a church that is so wonderful that I don't want to leave, and opportunities to let my light shine for the world to see, but I don't because I'm scared someone may tell me what I don't want to hear.  So what's next? When will I stop repressing the blessings that God has given to me, and start sharing the blessing with others the wonderful gifts that have been given to me... Hopefully, I will wake each day to give and find new blessings that are poured out. Only time will tell what's next in my life... Hopefully God will let me see a glimmer of what is next to come... What is next that He is going to teach me about His ultimate love for me and His children.... Eyes up, Mel~

						   So I hear there is this thing called time. Supposedly we are suppose to manage it somehow... But it seems to me that no matter how much I try to manage it, it always gets away from me. I'm starting to think that this is like a teenager... The more you try to restrain and manage it, the more it will try and run away from the constraints that are put around it... Anyone agree? Or a better comparison would be that I am Willey coyote, and time is the Road Runner... No matter how many times I use my acme company gadgets, there is always the backfire of what is a fool-proof plan. I am gradually learning that no matter what we plan for, how we plan for it, or the intensity we place on our well timed plans, God always has a different plan in mind. Eventually, I start to see a pattern. I make a plan, God changes it. So I wonder if I make a plan that I would never think would happen.... Would God change that plan? Or would He allow me to go through the stupidity of trying to "get one-up on God" and then just laugh at me later... Yup... I think He would just laugh at me later... LATER~ Mellie L~

						   There are very few things in life that cause me not to be happy when I think about it. But one thing is for sure... An epiphany made me extremely happy this weekend. As I was going through my planner, I realized I only had 2 mods (2 sets of 18 day classes) left in my schooling... Which means I will be done with classes this upcoming September. So to all of you suckers who laughed at me because I was going to school all summer and would be miserable.... HA! To you! As everyone else is going back to school... I will be starting my new job, working in the medical field... THAT, my friends, is what has made me happy today. Peace, Melanie
