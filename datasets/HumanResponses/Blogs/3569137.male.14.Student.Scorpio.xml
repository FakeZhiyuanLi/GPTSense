      Well, the day today was spent taking a verbal beration from my mates about pulling Toni on Saturday. It's okay though. It was the kind of friendly attack which I totally expected, especially given it was my first time. I think I got off okay though, because as far as I know, none of the people who would really kill me about it, because they don't like me. :D Anyway, depressing day today: first batch of results. :'( I didn't do   terrible  though. That's about it.   Tatty Bye.

      Well, it's me. Again. Well, despite how much I was shitting myself on Thursday, apparently I did okay on my French oral. Which is good. Anyway, after that I went home, and sat, and ate. No skating, I really didn't have the energy. I know if Sandy ever sees this he won't be happy, but since unless I die suddenly none of my friends probably will see this, i can. I just sat there. I should have gone into town on Friday, but I really couldn't be bothered. Plus I had no money. So I sat in my boxers at home till about 5pm, when I decided to get dressed, cause I wanted some air. Anyway, I was offered a tenner to tidy, and seeing as I wanted to go into town with my gf, Toni, I leapt at the chance of actually having some money to go to town with. So I worked. Okay, I didn't do that much, but it was enough to get me money. However, when I was about to go, my mum had already gone, leaving my dad to cough up the money, which he had none of. So, after claiming his card, and running to the bus stop, I finally got a bus, about two minutes before I was meant to be in town. And of course it was a fucking slow bus. And two people couldn't find there tickets. I was so late that Toni, Joey and Lindsay had already gone into the film. Now, being a short arse, and only 14 anyway, I courageously attempted to buy a ticket. And failed. So Joey came to the rescue. Anyway, I got in, and while Joe and Lindsay were huddled up in the corner I watched the film. I know, and I had Joey and Ben, as well as a few other random people, on at me and Toni all fucking day. Eventually though, when she was about to get the bus home, I did it. The first thought afterwards was "Ha! Fuck You Joey!". Anyway. I'm bored, so here's a few random pictures.   This one's for Will! Lol:         :D  Anyway, I have to go now.   Tatty Bye.

       And my Rockin' New Name is Ronny Rock Destroy.   Well, I'm bored again. I've got about 10 minutes before my IT exam at 11.45. It should be easy. But then again, when has anything been easy for me? These exams are so annoying. They've been made like GCSE's which just pressurises everyone.   I'm also dying from hayfever.   Tatty Bye.

      Wow, my first blog. This is a combination of me being very bored and having nothing better to do. Wait, they're nearly the same thing....  Well, while I really should have been revising for my exams (History 2 and Biology tomorrow *begins crying*), I got bored and decided to do some online tests. Here are the results:  First Off:  urlLink     urlLink Which Colossal Death Robot Are You?    urlLink Brought to you by Rum and Monkey    Then the various percentage tests:      I AM 29% EVIL GENIUS!
