      Another week quickly coming to a close, the weekend is upon us yet again, not that I am complaining, I wish we had a week of weekends and a weekend of work days...Some chance. This week has been rather testing, car problems have been dominant most of the time and over Â£200 spent to keep my four wheels on the road...Hopefully the last problem will be solved tomorrow. Can't complain I have had 2yrs of trouble free motoring. Tyres are the next expense to endure. I am holding out for a new car, top of the range merc would be nice. WELL A GIRL CAN DREAM! My poor dog hurt her paw today, she was limping after being let out this morning, she had been jumping up at the fence and most probably knocked it. I had a look and it seemed to be ok. When I returned from work, she seemed a lot better and ran outside without a limp, but when she saw me watching, she came up to me limping again and the more fuss I made of her, the worse the limp got... And they say dumb animals, I don't think think so...Very clever. Not being a football fan, but have just seen England defeated by Portugal. It is always the same when England play international football, goals get disallowed and other teams seem to result to cheating as did Argentina in the 80's. Most international games England play, are played against actors who like to throw themselves flailing to the ground like a dying swan, when a challenge from an opposing player is imminent and getting the opposing player booked...it is so one sided. Enough of football never to be mentioned again that is enough for one season... Wimbledon is a wash out, should change it to a water sport. Well that is as far as i go with sport, not a sporty person. But do like rugby or is the RUGBY PLAYERS??.... COR!!! Well BOING!! time for bed said Zebedee.

      I was out for a meal with my daughter tonight for a treat as she is shortly going on summer holiday to her grandmothers.  We were sat at a table eating our meal when a couple sat at the next table.....Now the mind starts to work overtime, is she his daughter? He must have been in his late 40's or even early 50's and her in her very early 20's, he looked quite furtive kept looking round to see who was looking. The girl went to order the meal, he sat there looking around....Well before their meal had chance to arrive, they suddenly decide to change tables...Well he decided to change tables. To the OTHER SIDE of the restaurant and kept glancing back at the table or was it US?? Did he read my mind that I had sussed him out that he was an old lech...Or was it my daughter with a mouthful of hotdog chewing like a cow chewing the cud staring at him that freaked him out? He seemed to have a problem with the food aswell. Had the manager there with him for a while, kept nodding down to the table next to us or was it US? Well anyway he sat next to us not the other way round...  They didn't stay long, I wonder why??? WAS IT US? We enjoyed OUR meal, it made a nice change. Back to beans on toast tomorrow. Toodle pip.

      What to write, I really want to write something but nothing really comes to mind. Maybe its amnesia that is to blame, or the pressure of modern day living. When does modern day stop? I can remember as a kid everything was modern, but now everything is old fashioned, but still now everything is modern....eh? To me the word modern was a 70's word. I went to a secondary modern school. We had modern furniture like G plan. So when does modern become old fashioned? But then, old fashioned then becomes modern, like the 1940's & 1950's furniture, designs and patterns.....argh!!! Grannies china is now modern again, it may be old but it is now modern, even the guzunder (chamber pot) is a modern requirement, not really sure what for, possible a plant pot, not the first time is been used for manure... ummm... Sorry to say I do actually have one in my possession, but it is not used for anything, it is an original my grandad used to use (I know nice thought). Kept up in the loft at the moment in case of emergencies of course. In the 1970's we were given the impression that in the future we would be wearing silver suits and going around in space ships, just like in the series space 1999.....Well that year came and went without anyone clothing themselves in tin foil.... So the modern day goes on to infinity and beyond. so here ends another dribble of scripted diarrhoea Until next time cheerio.

      Don't you just hate it when someone sticks their nose in where it is not wanted, I seem to have come across a lot of people like that just recently. One of which I am sad to say I am related to. Like the saying goes you can choose your friends but you can't choose your family. An interfering crone thinking they know it all because they are an educator of young minds, any young minds they have educated I deeply hope have not become warped individuals as a result of a bible bashing educator, who has never lived life, but only cocooned in their own little inept world. Who told these educators that they are always right because they can read a book and write on a blackboard. They listen to half the story and then take action on what they think they have correctly perceived, then involving another party to take action with the totally wrong information and hence causing a lot of upset with something that is nothing to do with them. I apologize for any mistakes in grammar and spellings but frankly my dear I don't GIVE a damn.  It is obviously a lack of self satisfaction of life experience that lead narrow minded sado people to interfere in others lives to get some sort of excitement...Not yet an Olympic event, but if it was, some pathetic individuals could quite easily make it to gold. My leaving statement is LIVE AND LET LIVE and keep your nose out of affairs that don't concern you. Apart from a bad start to the weekend due to busy bodies. I had another fantastic weekend although the weather wasn't brilliant the weekend was great. Farewell until next time.

      What a great weekend it was... the sun was shining the birds were singing and all was right with the world... It was an absolutely brilliant weekend, spent the weekend in a caravan on a small quiet site on the Cumbria/Lancashire border, with very good company. The site was very clean, the best I have seen in a long time, no kids running about and using your caravan or car for target practice with the hardest football that was ever made. No parents shouting at the the top of their voices at their offspring. Peace and quiet prevailed.....Excellent. That good that we have plans to return this weekend. I have so much to do in the next few days, not quite sure how to deal with it. But I am a woman I can deal with more than one thing at a time, but trying to cut the grass and hoover the front room at the same time could cause a problem... But I never did like the deep shag pile carpet. We went to Blackpool on Saturday, certainly see some sights there, women on weekend long hen nights....What happened to the girlie night down the pub before getting hitched. Guys out on weekend long hen nights...A group of lads all wearing kilts?? Or just like wearing skirts???...Mmmmm....Say no more, but there was a handbag attached. The old grannies sitting on the pier, some dressed for winter in scorching hot temperatures, while others exposing nearly every wrinkle. You then have the Darby and Joan rally team out in training careering around the countryside upsetting other road users with their ridiculous speeds... Come Sunday they will be out there in force. I have come to the conclusion that the police allow Darby and Joan to use the roads for practice as a traffic calming measure, who needs a bump in the road when you have a Darby and Joan just around the next bend. Summer driving is such a fantastic experience, but you need nerves of steel and plenty of vallium.... That is all for my observations for one weekend, I will try to make some better ones next time. Farewell until later. Great weekend Ian thanks.

      Well I must be feeling quite ill, I have just set the ironing board up and actually DONE some ironing, with a hot iron after I remember to switch the plug on...I normally use the tumble drier... but the cable isn't long enough. Thought I had lost my handbag today, went clothes shopping, put my handbag in the hand holding the clothes and then couldn't find it....a mild panic ensued as I went back to where I have been looking at some nice jeans for my daughter...it WASN'T there, then just about to make a quick dash to where I had been stood before, and for some reason decided to look in my hand with the clothes in and the it WAS safe and sound swing amongst the clothes....Wow! What a relief... Then the shock started to set in and I was trembling after that, I decided I had everything I needed including my handbag and went and paid....PHEW! Could have been so much worse and hysterical.  Handbags can be such a liability, so much better to carry money, keys and phone in pockets...Especially when the phone is on vibrate and that tickles too when an obliging someone rings or messages you.... I said messages not massages, but much prefer the latter... Not much to chat about today, a pretty uneventful day, 'for a change' more relaxed and laid back. Looking forward to the coming weekend...Look forward to most weekends but this one especially doing something different than cutting the grass and doing the housework..The grass is long and must now be hiding some long lost tribe..I'm sure I can see their camp fires at night. Until next time farewell... Hello Ian...LOL

      I am absolutely shattered today, loads of heavy lifting, driving and sweating heavily...from 8am this morning until 5pm, no time for a break, must keep going to complete the work... but i did enjoy it today. Getting back to the yard and then a stroppy driver...i just ingnored it and went home and left it moaning...I feel i have done as much as this one person if not more...so who is moaning now i hear you say...well this is what blogging is all about.  An early night is called for i think to recharge my batteries. My mind is not tuned in this evening with quick wit and repartee... more brain dead than anything else, some folk may say no change then. My hassle from my first ramblings, is hopefully getting sorted, the idiot who does what he can, to disrupt everything, didn't turn in for work on monday, i was told before the event that he was going to pull a sicky...he announced it evidently. What a grade one tosser...Fallen into his own big gob...HEE! HEE! HEE! (EVIL CACKLING LAUGHTER). so with the hassle we are no further on with the situation at the moment as i predicted, still at square one, but the manager seems to be taking a grasp of the problem see what tomorrow brings. My personal life is taking a turn for the better tell more another time, watch this space.

      This is my first time of writing a blog and the ramblings of a mad woman, a woman on the edge. Its finding something to say, I suppose the thing that is bugging me right now in life is men and their incapability to face and deal with any issues that are put before them. I will not tar all men with the same brush as at the end of the day we are all individuals... and there are some really nice guys out there....Hi guys... Working with men can be like running a kindergarten, one individual I can mention( but mention no names). He is so arrogant and pigheaded, lets his work mates down as much as possible and tries to disrupt the company to the best of his ability. He thinks he is indispensable and we work for him and he calls the shots not him work for the company...he is a total arsehole he is not liked he is a liar and story teller...Another areshole is the manager he is in his mid 30's and can not take responsibility. He seems to have a problem with single parents, when I have mentioned about doing over time or work bank holidays it will be difficult for me as I don't always have someone to look after my daughter, his response is we can all use that excuse....He has a wife at home looking after his kids hope he is never in the position in which he has to rely on someone else to look after them. I am just the administrator but I do run the section,  when I don't get any support from the management after days of asking for him to deal with an issue, the shit then hits the fan because I have to go over his head to get things done... and even then he is told to deal with it, and we are just back to square one. I have never been so stressed as I have been the last couple of weeks.  I am just getting on and doing my job now and the twat of a manager can go and swivel...I have a lot of work to do so I am to busy to help him out... Plus a perusal of the local job paper may serve me better. Me bitter and twisted?.... Nah!  But just watch out for the broomstick flying low in the night sky and that shrill cackle ringing out in the blackness....

      Well where do I begin. Last weekend I suppose is a good place to start. Families who needs them? Like I said before, you can choose your friends but not your family. Bullying Brothers never seem to grow up just grow older. Jealousy and envy are ripe in families. A young man working hard to accomplish his dream and a jealous uncle wishing it was his son working his way to the top of pile... Instead of cadging a lift on his fathers shirt tails, a domineering wife stirring trouble for everyone, thinking she is correct at every turn and the only difference between her and Hitler is that she has a better moustache. Leaving families behind to dwell in their own putrid prejudice and depravity. I have had a different week. Not at work Monday and Tuesday it has been a nice change and I have had visitors.  Monday we went to Dumfries and saw where HRH the Queen goes shopping. It was Marks and Sparks and I know she was there because her corgi was tied up on the railings, she must have been having a good shop as the corgi was tied up for some time, we walked passed a few times hoping for a glimpse of Maj... But alas we were not fortunate. But my car was in to have new tyres fitted ( no not in marks and sparks). So had to get back to collect it. Tuesday was a bit of a late start, but we made it to Edinburgh, it was fantastic. We went to the castle, that was good, rather confused though, why would anyone take a golf club to a castle?? Could it have been his pet golf club called 'clubby'. Or was it for more sinister purposes like a smash and grab of the Scottish crown jewels... We will never know... The weather was back to its normal British summer self...RAINING. But that didn't dampen our enjoyment. Our meal was quite good in Garfunkels, i was full but wanted to have a pudding so I settled on something safe and light to eat like strawberries and ice cream/cream. I thought I could manage that...BOY was I wrong never seen such a big dish of strawberries and cream, hasten to add I didn't finish it, and I hate to waste food but on this occasion I was defeated. Edinburgh is a very interesting place and would like to spend a lot more quality time there investigating all the haunts and of course all places where the spirits hang around......On the optics. An annoying start, but which turned into a pearler of a week. Happy people all round.
