       Just to quell any stupid ideas you may have...   1. JS Forums was a group of forums. This is a blog. They're two entirely different things.   2. Since this is a blog (see above), I'll be on here much more often and longer than the forum. Plus, summer will give me a lot of extra time on my hands to do stuff with.  3. If 'Little Princess' annoys anyone (especially me, excluding himself), I can and will ban him.  4. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be misquoted and used against you in court. (OK I admit that had nothing to do with anything)   WS

      NEWSFLASH! Today, my computer crashed. I had to reinstall the entire operating system. Isn't that lovely? Took me a good 3 hours or so. Blaaaahhh...  NEWSFLASH ALSO! If my friend Matt reads the email I sent him and isn't too big of a lazy bum to stay here for more than 2 measly seconds, he'll surely be dropping some kind of comment in here. He'll pretty much be a regular I think.  NEWSFLASH ALSO ALSO!  urlLink HomestarRunner.com  was updated yesterday, with the addition of  urlLink Strong Bad email #106 . That was pretty good, but it didn't make me burst out laughing like it's supposed to. Oh well, they can't all be gems. At least not to me, anyway. By the way, that "we're gonna have to jump" part at the end was actually somehow mildly cool. Weird. What the heck, LONG LIVE H*R!!   WS

      As you see, I've already picked my topic for the first real post. I could explain its sudden-ness, but whenever I explain things, stuff gets messy. Plus, then I have to lay down all the tarps and stuff (by which I just mean tarps, which I don't have by the way), and get a smock (which I don't have either), and this ceased being funny 3 sentences ago anyway. So ON WITH THE SHOW!  OK, so... the topic is Time Cube. To get started, I want you to go read  urlLink this  and watch in amazement as your brains melt and slowly ooze out your ears. It's just lovely, isn't it? Just like that painting that shows the bug-eyed guy eating a baby. Don't look for it, because you already know you won't like it.   Anyway, thanks to Captain Amazing Greatest Wisest Human Ever, I no longer have to live as a stupid and evil academia-enslaved android.   I'll take this moment to point out (while dodging flaming garbage) that the above was sarcasm, and so is much of the below. Actually, screw that, I'm just going to say that I think Time Cube is 100% bogus. Anything in this post that says otherwise is sarcasm. OK, thank you, back to your regularly sheduled program, or whatever.   Obviously Time Cube has been painstakingly researched and tested. It must have taken the site's entire staff of Ivy League scientists to come up with such intelligent statements as "Word has not the substance of a fart" and "Talking dog could enslave humanity." Indeed, Time Cube does answer all.  Oh, wait, it's not a team of intelligent, mature, and cooperative minds; it's just a decrepit old man from Florida. Silly me.  Time Cube is a humongous, festering blob of insane babbling. And MAN, is it babbling. It goes on. For PAGES. And it's not as if he even UTILIZES the space he's taken; he just repeats the same garbage over and over and over and over and over and over and over and OVER AND OVER AND O-O-O-V-E-E-R-R-R A-A-A-N-N-D O-O-V-   *SLAP*   Oh, right. Yes. As I was saying.   The guy's crazy about hammering several "facts" into your skull. For example, every one of us is educated stupid and evil. Yes, every one of us, except for him, apparently. Also, he's infuriated by the fact that no teacher or professor will teach Time Cube to their students, which may be the reason why he thinks they're so stupid and evil.  You see, he classifies everyone who will not openly accept his "concepts" as evil. As any sane human would know, however, you can't teach the wisdom of Time Cube to students on the same grounds that you can't teach them the wisdom of drinking alcohol, or doing drugs, or shoving sharp objects (or pretty much anything for that matter) into your rectum. I would go into detail about what exactly he's written in there, but at the risk of having an aneurysm, I'd suggest that you go see it for yourself. That is, if you don't mind seeing someone totally destroy nearly every known form of logic and thought, but let's face it, if you're still reading this, you're pretty much past the point of thinking.  Here's a list of... um... 'interesting' quotes/ideas from the man himself.  > "Beliefs equate to pornography, because they coexist on the internet." > Gene Ray (the man behind all this craziness) is "the wisest human to ever live." He's even dedicated an entire domain name to it. I kid you not. See for yourself  urlLink here . > "Talking dog could enslave humanity." I know I repeated that, but it was worth repeating. > "It is imperative that you know what you don't know, but what you know will not allow you to know what you don't know." > "-1 x -1 = +1 is stupid and evil." > "Humans are educated stupid because they are really dumb and cannot even comprehend the Time Cube creation code when it is explained to them." >  urlLink Somehow, Einstein, Socrates, Jesus, and (I'm not kidding) Clinton are involved.  By the way, he says that little drawing is "confirmation" of this crap. > Schools are staffed and run by religious zealots. > "Academia builds word bomb, kinda like old Trojan Horse." The word bomb was funny enough, but juxtaposed with the word "kinda"... sheesh  >>  The basic (I think) concept behind Time Cube is that everything ever in all of all everything is somehow a four-cornered cube. Everything in the universe has four "corners" in some way. Of course, a cube has eight corners (NOT four) if you're actually LOOKING at the damn thing, but hell, what do I know, I'm educated stupid and evil.    There's a lot of other stuff in there that I haven't mentioned, including races and stuff. I might write about it at a later date, but for now I think I'll give it a rest. I can only take so much insanity in one night. Plus, I've got a new EGM to read. Happy cubelessness, stupidity and evil to all!   WS

      OK, we're all set and good to go with WingedSerpent's Random Stuff Blog! However, I still have no idea what to do with this space. When I think of a good topic to write some stuff about, that's, uh... what I'll write some stuff about. Right. So, forward we go, or... whatever.   I currently don't have any particular choices yet, but I've been thinking about discussing (for the time being) video games, Time Cube (and I thought I was crazy), and of course, ME. Yes, me. I know you're not impressed. Just shut up, OK?   WS
