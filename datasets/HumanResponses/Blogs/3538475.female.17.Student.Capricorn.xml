      This is my last blog, I have come to my senses and Matt was right all along  From now on I'm not gonna blog my emotions, I'm not gonna use this blog ever again, I'm even gonna stay away from msn for a while  Modern technology is to blame, I have a theory about it

      I'm fed up of crying now, I've cried too much recently....I can't stop crying...like I can't sotp now  I hurt...but I don't want to have to be doing counselling anymore, i'm fed up of talking about myself I just want to live my life now  But I can't live my life until i know what's going on....and I wont know for a long time, although i have a good idea of what will happen, and I don't want to think about it like that  deportation would make things so much easier, could deport people who get in the way and never let them come back

      So two more sessions of counselling and I'm done...whoopdedoop  trying to fix things but getting sarcasm in return so I'll leave it until mature and proper conversations can take place and also until other people who should be more sensitive to the situation keep their noses out and leave us alone.  I get the feeling even if I did try fix things again there would be no point in it anyway because it looks like minds have been made up and a get-out-clause is being searched for.  But then hey, I dunno.....could be getting the wrong end of the stick....I could actually be the one making everything worse by trying to be civil and adult and looking for a light at the end of the tunnel.  On a brighter note, Jemma gave me a lift home today, I deffinately want to start driving soon, I'm getting impatient.  Am home alone atm, dunno where everybody has gone...:S  I am also bored....  I think I should try untangle my necklace....but I dunno if there is any point...I don't even think either of us are wearing them atm  ah well more updates on my 'interesting' life later

      I have counselling today and I hope that it will be one of my last sessions because:  I have been spontanious recently and am learning to like spontanuity, I am also not trying to take control of certian situations and am leaving it to time, I can handle being in this grey area.  I also made other people do the work in drama instead of me taking hold of it and taking charge, I think I am achieving what I have set out to achieve and can continue achieveing it without my counsellors help.  I am also learning to relax and enjoy myself

      I have been having strange dreams recently...this was last nights  I dreamt that Mum could drive and she'd driven us to the park and we met Joanna there and Mum and her started arguing and I got in the middle of it and Joana and I started having a massive punch up and I really went hell for leather into her.  But then we ran out of energy and just started chatting...like normal

      Last night I went to my Amelia and Craig's and we sat around chatting all night, defining what a relatiosnhip is and what it means to the individual, what it means to me and what I'd hope it meant to my partner.  It seems what it means to me and what it means to him are two totally different things.....  flirt: if you flirt with someone, you behave as if you are sexually attracted to them but without serious intentions.....  why should u want to flirt with anyone else when u have somebody perfectly suitable already? why is it acceptable to be sexually attracted to anyone but the person u r with or a film star etc.  So they may not be serious intentions but they are still intentions.  No matter what status of a relationship, faithfullness is the whole reason it works, because the two individuals don't want anybody else but each other so feel no need to flirt with others...or so I thought.  My heart has been chipped away at so many times over the past few weeks that I'm starting to lose the pieces and am unsure if I can ever put it back together again.  In the car on the way home from a great day out with family (people I forgot I missed and loved) I was willing to try and forget it and put it behind me but it's all rubbed in my face again...so I will now be avoiding the forum as I can't escape it there....  I had a really good weekend...until I got home from work and until I got home from dubach.  To a heart formed for friendship and affection, the charms of solitude are very short lived...(Fanny Burney) :s

      Today was really good....I ended up going for a pic nic with Joe Amelia and Craig, we laughed a lot at Craig's clumsy expense and we ate lots too.  Who would ever have guessed that a field full of corn could be so much fun?  Many photos of C&A style poses and Craig and Amelia running in slow motion towards each other were taken and guess what??? you can make corn angels!!! winter fun all year round.  Now I must get to the bathroom to pick out all the bits of corn from my underwear and top.  So I had a really good day until about 4ish

      Frustration is a good word...I like the word frustration it has two t's.....as the wierd kid in our country's good might say.  On a serious note I don't know if frustration can get any more frustrating than this.  I can think of a few people I would gladly hit right now or even better I would cut off people's balls so they couldn't produce anymore tainted offspring.  For various reasons I am frustrated and upset....and completely confused.  Went to see a play last night with the school after a drama exam...think I may just about get a D in the exam...but we all thought that last night was going to be a wash out, but it wasn't it was actually lots of fun...Rach, Jill, Amy, Jo and I sat for the hour and a half before the play started on the decking of the bar area and had such a giggle remembering different stories from school.  It was actually lots of fun and I almost pissed myself and I think Rach did.  The play was called 'Our Country's Good' all about convicts who were sent to live in penal collonies in Australia.  It was actually quite interesting.  So today I have taken the day off school because I'm 'tired'.  Actually I just can't face it today.  So I'm going round my mate Joe's to make big fuck off sized sandwhiches and to watch films all day.  I'm gonna miss that kid, in about a month they will be moving :'(  Anyway I gotta go out soon so ttyl dudes  I would just like to add fuck off and rub it in my face a little bit more why don't u?

      I'm paralysed Stuck between the devil and your smile I've got my feet wet baby Just about to die And then you throw me back Against the wall What a nice surprise Watch me fall  And you won't see me crawling  You won't see me crawling No crawling ain't for me baby don't, baby don't see me Crawling  If sentiment Seems to be running dry And there's no relent I keep on trying And then I realise What I can do Picking up the pieces of my life I'll get over you  And you won't see me crawling  You won't see me crawling No crawling ain't for me baby don't, baby don't see me Crawling  (Crawling, Crawling, Crawling, Crawling, Crawling, Crawling)  I'm bigger know Despite of you And when it all turns round It'll all come back on you Make no mistake I learnt my lesson now The risks we take can break us down  Until we're crawling  Until we're crawling I say crawlings not for me baby don't, baby don't see me Crawling  Crawling  You won't see me crawling No crawling ain't for me baby don't, baby don't see me Crawling   kosheen - crawling   i think these lyrics are quite good, wasting my time are good lyrics too, relevant also I suppose  today i got up and went to school, then i got in a bad mood and it's stuck all day really....not helped by the burning of my wrist on the oven tray.  nice pink line now.  the kids are getting worried that it's forever that this little piece of love is at the end of it's tether  can't pretend I'm not worrying with them

      I have that song runnign through my head from Friday night still...GREAT PARTAAAY!! Was loadsa fun had a great time and still managed to get up in time for work despite Ian and Smart staying and chatting to my parents for ages after walking me home, bless you guys you deserve an award.  Have had a good weekend.  Went to my Aunt and Uncle's, stayed up til early hours playing cards for pennies and generally having lots of giggles at my father's expense.  Bless him, but he will drink too much and start sneezing and try laying clubs as spades etc.  Slept on the sofa, well i say slept, more like lightly dozed for the 4 hours between going to bed and getting up again for a shower and realising I left practically everything at home.  Then we all trundled off after waiting for Bev to get ready (as per fucking usual) to Dagenham market, home of the essex girls!! WOOHOO, got some fake tans and sovereigns going on there.  I only got a ring, which meine Mutti got for me due to her buying some ridiculously ugly some-strange-era inspired bag for said time waster (ie:BEV).  I have to say my ring is much better then her bowling ball sized bag.  So then we all went home, and I got a squished and bloody fly in my hair because I try pose too much in my cousin's car.  Ah well, if he wants to do 120 down the motorway with the windows open and the system up, I'm not gonna stop him.  I actually almost shat myself though when I watched the speedo creep up, I thought, oh god shall I get my pad of paper out and start writing my goodbye letters now?  ANYWAY so I'm home now and missed the last bits of the football match but n/m, I'm sure we lost, as we usually do.

      the strangest thing happened to me last night, my boyfriend decided he wanted a break and then got annoyed because I was upset and took my anger out on him, strange that because when he gets annoyed and swears at me I stand there and take it.  So he 'walked' away from me, I say 'walked' because it was all done over the internet.  I am going to avoid msn now because then people have to do things to me face to face.  I have explained so many times that I don't need time to cool off etc I have to talk about things there and then...but because he was thinking of 'us' he went anyway.  SO when I get sworn at and taken the piss out of I can think of 'us' and go away too.  I don't think I would be this upset still if I had been allowed to talk about it last night.

      today I revised...again.  I haven't done very well with revision today, it's going quite slowly.  I don't think I will get it all done as I haven't been able to concentrate today.  I thought I'd be clever and sit outside and revise to get some colour on myself..I got colour, just not the nice brown I hoped for...I could sit on the shelves in the shop and be sold as a beetroot, well my back could neway.  I think my legs are destined for milk bottle-dom forever.  I would have gone into town for an hour or so....but I couldn't meet people as I don't have credit and my only way of getting in had gone already.  So tonight I plan to revise in between watching bits of tv, having fags and eating and drinking.

      So today was biology day...I am confident in myself that I have failed, if I get an E it will be a miracle.  After the exams I went into town...then we sat in town...and sat in town some more...and then just for fun a little bit more, so I went home, wasn't particularly worth my while but wouldn't have seen someone until Saturday if I hadn't so kinda had no choice.  Have discovered a yummy sandwich in subway, all thanks to sarah, so I got myself one and pigged it before the bus came.  After town I went to aerobics...it was too hot so the instructor didn't work us very hard, although she did stop me to tell me i was fading away.  Why is it when somebody loses weight they can't look good for it, they have to be fading away or losing too much or getting scarily thin ? I say they're all just jealous, it's only when i lay down that you can see my hip bones so it's no where near too much.  So all in all, as per usual, today was pretty dull so I will relax now with some beer and a couple of fags

      Well today I am itchy and grumpy.  Spent about 4 hours revising and am nowhere near complete and the exam starts at 9am tomorrow.  I hate biology and I wish I hadn't taken it.  Counselling went strangely.  I realised a few things and worked out a few things.  I don't feel, I think and I still surprise her with my honesty and self-awareness.  She gets the impresison I have trouble expressing my emotions because I don't feel my emotions I think them.  I'm also turning more and more into my parents by the day and cannot make a tulip a daffodil no matter how hard I try despite what they've instilled in me.  And there I was thiking I was Hermione, so I either have to accept the tulip as the tulip and give up trying to change it into the daffodil or look for the daffodil.  I want to stick with the tulip because he's what I want, when he behaves.  If patience is a virtue I'm not a very virtuous person, I have to learn to be, as far as the tulip goes.  I also have to learn to not jump into the pit but to stand by it.  I think I'm gonna start playing with the toybox next week so I can learn to let the child appear again and so I can learn to relax.  So my task for this week is to think about things that I am doing and my decisions in them and decide am I being an adult/parent?  I need more of the child.  Well I suppose the rveision isn't gonna revise itself...but my tummy's rumbling...

      Well today was good, one of the best so far!!  Had a very progressive chat with my significant other and it seems that maybe things are looking up.  There's hope yet.  I feel good about this :D  I am getting frustrated by the secret ingredients game on www.Shrek2.com , the game is made for five year olds and, alas, a seventeen year old of such high intelect, cannot figure it out...ah maybe that's because I do not have intelect.  As prooven by my revision for biology, I see a big fat U coming my way!! WOOHOO!!  More re-sits = More fun ..... and pigs fly.  Another highlight to the day, other than having quality time, was getting a kfc twister, yes, you're right I lead a dull and boring life, you're amost asleep reading about it, well try living it!!  That is not the case for much longer, I hope.  Last night I renewed friendships with 'the girl down the road' & her amusing and sexually frustrated parents, this renewal was of course aided by alcohol and nibbles and a good old chat about the finer points of life, I promote un-planned get-togethers like this, they always turn out to be better then expected.  Well now, I guess I should get on with that revision, but not after some cancery goodness of the cigarrette kind.  Toodle pip young-uns'!

      today I worked, from 9-5:30 and earned £35....which i would liek to spend on someone....but I'm not feeling that generous anymore, I think I will spend it on myself.  It was a usual Saturday, waking up 10 minutes before work starts and crawling around the shop until lunchtime where I had a break for an hour then returned to crawling around like a dozy bee at the begining of summer.  However there was no dreaded mrs.p, I think with the welcome she recieved last week she wont be appearing for a while.  I love working in a shop, it's the customers that make it horrible (apart from the odd cute baby)  I hung around expecting a visit and a text at least but still I got none apart from the ever-loyal nat and louise...no chomp this time Nat, I'm dissappointed!  It's good to feel wanted...son't you agree?  Argh I'm getting into a state of self-pity now, stop it!  Well my Saturday night will be spent in front of the computer and tv instead of in front of a cinema screen, the way I would have liked it, with someone close to me, but alas it isn't meant to be.  Ah well boo fucking hoo...least I'm fully aware of the difference between wanted and taken for granted

      Was up for about 10 minutes today and got bored straight away, even smoking bores me now...can't wait to get back to school.  How sad am i?  I went into town today, but the bus driver gave me a child ticket and said take it and we'll not argue about it, I was impressed!! It's not often that a bus driver is so nice to their passengers.  I see we have a rebel in the ranks!  It inspired me because I thought, if he got caught doing something like that he could get serious punishment yet he still did it...doesn't take much to do a good deed.  So, until I'm back at school my entries will be as boring as an afternoon in a nursing home.
