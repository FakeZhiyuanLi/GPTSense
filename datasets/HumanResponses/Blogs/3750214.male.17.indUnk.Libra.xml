             I read the first two chapters of my book for a homework assignment. I will now summarize what I learned from my reading. People write certain kinds of papers. A specific way to write a paper was to problematize. Ask one's self questions about their paper and answer them while writing the paper. One should also create a sort of problem with their topic and come up with a solution that can conclude the paper.

       Brian Malone  English 1010  &nbsp;  Descriptive Narrative  Utah Firework Laws  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, little Jimmy Johnson found himself incredibly excited for the upcoming 4th of July. The thought of sparklers and spinners and showers being lit off in every direction drove him crazy. He wanted very badly to go to the nearest firework stand and buy the whole lot so he could ease his craving. He asked his mother if she would accompany him to the stand, but she replied that she did not have the money at the moment and also that he would not be allowed to light any of the fireworks anyways because of the law. Jimmy was furious! He charged into his room and slammed the door. Suddenly, a mischievous smile spread across his face. If his mother did not have the money to buy fireworks, than he would earn it himself. A triumphant cackling could be heard throughout the house as Jimmy’s plan was set into motion.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very next day, Jimmy got the lawn mower out of his garage and found four customers in as many hours. His total income for the day added up to be sixteen dollars. “Muhahahahahaha!” laughed Jimmy, as he locked his money into the play safe in his room. Over the next three days, Jimmy earned another twenty-two dollars for a grand total of thirty-eight dollars. Jimmy had enough money to throw a private celebration of his own. He bounded to his mother and boastfully commanded her to drive him to the fireworks stand. She replied that she would normally be happy to, but that Jimmy would not be able to light any fireworks that he would buy because of the law. Jimmy found himself defeated when he returned to his room and returned the money to his safe. Will Jimmy have the chance to buy fireworks? We’ll never know!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can understand the necessity of firework laws in Utah and in every state. But I do not agree entirely with our state’s laws on firework restrictions. The state of Utah allows a few varieties of fireworks to be sold without a license. However, they do not allow a few other kinds of fireworks to be sold without a license. Some of these fireworks would include: Bottle Rockets, Sky Rockets, Roman Candles, Firecrackers, Missiles, Sky Flyers, and Display Shells. There is also a law explaining when fireworks are allowed to be lit.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that if some states sell any kind of firework to any legal-aged customer, that our state should do the same. If our state is going to sell some kinds of fireworks, why not sell all the kinds? The profits made on fireworks would definitely increase. Many people travel to another state that does sell every kind of firework and then bring them back here to light off. If people are going to light off illegal fireworks anyway, then why not make them legal.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the story of Jimmy Johnson who couldn’t buy fireworks because he wouldn’t be able to light them, we also have restrictions as to when we are allowed to light fireworks. The fourth of July could be two weeks away, but the firework stands start popping up and selling to whoever wants them. However, the fireworks are not to be lit until the appointed time that the law says. In our case, that time was July 1st. I believe that if fireworks are sold, they can be lit whenever one wishes them lit. It is a waste of time to go and buy fireworks and then just have them sit at home. I think that fireworks should be allowed to be discharged throughout the entire month of July.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, our state has many drought conditions. Many accidents can happen when handling fireworks. It is very dangerous to light fireworks in a dry environment. If a fire were to start, it would easily spread. By restricting when people are allowed to light fireworks, it keeps them safer. Some fireworks are more dangerous than others. It may be necessary to make some fireworks illegal in order to keep people more safe. Some states do not allow any kind of firework to be lit. At least our state does allow some kinds of fireworks to be discharged. There can be fewer accidents caused by fireworks if an appointed time to light them is created.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Jimmy could end up buying fireworks when he is allowed to light them. Or his mother could decide that they will not buy any that year. Our state has restrictions saying what fireworks are allowed to be sold to someone who does not have a license to buy fireworks. Our state also restricts when fireworks are allowed to be lit. There can come many complaints to both of these restrictions. For example, if one can sell one kind of firework, why not be able to sell every kind. Also, people should be allowed a longer period of time when they can light fireworks. However, these restrictions help to keep people more safe. In writing this paper, I now believe in our state’s firework laws.

          I chose the, "It is a good idea to make children take music lessons" assertion.         Believing: I believe that it is a good idea to make children take music lessons for a few reasons. First, that particular child could easily become interested in music and appreciate being forced into taking lessons. Having taken music lessons for five years, I saw many cases where kids commmented frequently on how much they enjoyed playing an instrument or learning about music. In some cases, if kids applied themselves enough, they could become professionals in their course of music. That could lead to a career in something they enjoy, which is a very big bonus in these days. There is a theory that children who take any sort of music lessons end up more prepared, or understanding more the subjects they are taught in school. Mathematics is a good example of this. There is a huge amount of math involved in music, along with other things. The outcome of music lessons, when performing a piece of music, makes one use their brain to see the music, read it, and play it at the same moment. Music can really apply brain power to anyone who tries it. Next, some kids may be under the assumption that they have no skills in many subjects, and that is not a great thing for children to be thinking. If they were forced to take music lessons, a large percentage would find that, if they practiced and remained focused and determined, they would be very skilled in music. When one spends the time to become skilled in music, it can become a very entertaining hobby. In conclusion, making children take music lessons could be a very good thing in many cases.        Doubting: I doubt that forcing children to take music lessons would turn out very good. Would this be giving children a say in what they do in their lives? What if they don't want to take music lessons. In some cases, many children are not up to the challenge of learning music. If children were forced to take music lessons, their free will would deminish. This does not seem fair to me at all. Being associated with music for many years, I have seen dozens of kids who did not enjoy music in the slightest bit but only went on because they were being forced to. This seems to me like a huge waste of time. Why continue to learn music if you are not going to expand your knowlege and skill in it, ever. Forcing kids to do what they do not want to do does not make them feel that they have a say in their life, it also destroys their self-reliance. Music lessons do take up a large amount of time and many children do not have that. Children could find that music is too much for them to handle. Children could improve the skills they have rather than spending time on something else and losing what skills they already had. In conclusion, I doubt that making children take music lessons would improve their lives. I think that it could easily turn out to be a very negative experiencef for them.
