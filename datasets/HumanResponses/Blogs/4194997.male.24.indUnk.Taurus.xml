       "Vishvam vishnur vashathkaaro...."  MS Subhalakshmi's voice was filling the house "Aandava I really did the history test well..sari somewot well...first questionkku oru 5 marksu...third question oru 8 marksu...antha 15 marks questions renduthukkum sethu oru 20 marksu..2 mark questions ellam sethu oru 15 marksu...ayyayo kootina 48 thaana" ya this is Hari's prayer..."Aandava somehow make it 62..please..illati unakke theriyum appa kittenthu dharmadi vilumnu...by the way, I think amma and appa have really forgotten all about the history exam...why dont I just.."... "Hari-amma...Hari-amma"...ya this was Hari's mother's name according to AVaunty.."En payyan intha vaati class topper...Historyla thaan highest mark" went AVaunty..."wow God...did I just talk my prayers loud" thought Hari..."unga payyanukku ella exam papersum kuduthutaangala??" said AVaunty..."illanga innum history paperum, Art education marksum varanum" answered Hari's mom..."Good...kaalan kaarthala vanthu nyabaga paduthi vitta...Aandava unakku manasula eerame illaiya...inikki naan sethen" ..."Hari, antha Pillaiyar slogam sollitu poda...nalla mark varanumnu vendikko" went Hari's mom..."enna kavuthu vittala, inikku unakkku no slogams"... he came out of the swami room into the hall... "yenpa Hari, Historyla nalla mark vantha nee than class firsta?" said AVaunty sarcastically... Hari's mom was silent..somehow MS's voice was in the distance..."Mavane ivala oda oda verattanum da"...Hari smiled.."Illa aunty. enakku histroy avvalova pudikkathu" he said scratchin his head.."appo ethu than unakku pudikkum" shouted Hari's mom..she was a history teacher previously..her voice sounded like the whole family's esteem is at stake.."Art Educa..."Hari's words were lost..."pudikkutho pudikkaliyo nalla mark eduthu first varanumla. En payyan gopikku kooda sanskrit pudikkathu...." went on AVaunty's boasting..."engenthu varaanga da ivangalaam...cha...God pudicha subject ondi edukkara maathiri oru ulagam create pannirukka koodaatha" thought Hari slipping off into his dream world.

      Hello All, This is the first posting to my "Adutha Veetu Aunty" ( in tamil means Aunty Next Door)...This blog will mostly be in Tanglish(Tamil kalantha english)...lets move on All my life, I wanted to write about this...just to let out my heart and imagination....i chose this title, which is sexier like Malgova maami, but it isnt even near sex(sorry guys)...but it is about how the aunty next door can ruin ur life...everyone will have this experience i bet...for those who survived I envy u...here goes. He was quite intelligent and knew when to do things...for all he wanted was to lie down or play and enjoy life as it goes. His birth itself proves it...he was born at 10:30 pm in the nite just to make sure he can lie down and sleep once he is out. and he did. well, so his life must have been a happy one till this adutha veetu aunty arrived. He was born into a middle class family in India and the mentality was all ripe and fresh there. At the age of 10, his family moved into an apartment in the center of the city. Got into a good school to study. One morning, he opens his bag, checks his timetable, fills it with loads of books and tries to get to school early to meet his friends and play this new game they found out yesterday...but no escape.."enanga pulla saapadaama kalambuthu??" roared a distant voice...no not his mom...guessed it rite..Adutha veetu aunty coming down the steps.."Adiyei, un velaiya paathundu pogarthu"...he thought to himself...but thinking is all he can do...his mom came rushin out...."Hari, saapudu da"...there goes the new game...he gobbled up as fast as he can..."En pullaikku I give Complan daily. Thats y he is so healthy"...said AVAunty looking at him...He has a thin profile and didnt give a damn to it..but now he has to..his mom came out with a glass of complan..."aduthu neengal kekairukkum paadal Apoorva sagodharargal padathilirunthu..." cried out the morning FM radio..."aaga super da" he thought to himself..."Intha mel veetu ponnu panna kootha keteengala??" started AVaunty..."Enna?" his mom answered..."Hari, nee schoolkku kalambu and switch off the radio"...AVaunty sat down on the sofa with a satisfied look and started the gossip..."only if this aunty had a power switch" he thought to himself ..."annathe aadurar..."started the song when he switched off the power and started to school...."Intha naal oru iniya naal"..
