      It’s been a few days since I last updated this log. And at this moment, I have mixed feelings about a lot of things. I don’t know what to make of it! But,  I think it will boil down to the same thing I have always found myself liking, almost  to the point of convincing myself that there is a life after, a second chance , a pathway towards my journey back.   Michael and I finally came to an agreement with regards to the current living arrangement we have. No more freeloading, as well, it shouldn’t be. So, a little effort on my part, whether that means advertising, marketing, or something will need to be done so I can at least pay next months rent. Although some of the terms are a bit one sided, I will have to live with it for the meantime. It’s the price I have to pay. Right now, it sure doesn’t seem fair, but, I’ve been down this road before and hindsight tells me that, so what! Someone was there and extended a helping hand. No one said I had to like it or even be happy about it.   Went to an AA meeting on Wednesday with Stephanie. I must say, it was weird going there because I wasn’t able to relate to the subject matter. But,  what can I do. I find these meetings purpose is to make you feel better about yourself because you are hearing someone elses struggle and sob story, which, mind you,  I can relate to at times but,  some positive stories could help too! But if it was like that all the time, then there wouldn’t be any reason or rather the disease wouldn’t be a disease would it.   Addiction, in my opinion, can be brought about by ones feeling that something is lacking within their lives. They don’t realize it at the time they begin doing it. But, when it starts affecting daily happy life,  which, in my case, I didn’t realize until it was too late, then it was like, wow! How’d I allow this to get to this point!   I did it because I felt that if I did it, I could help someone get out of it! Kind of like in order to help someone from drowning you have to get in the water right. Except, you forget, hey,, I don’t know how to swim! Not professionally anyways.  I don’t know why it is that whenever I see Tyler, I always feel sad afterwards. It’s weird. I guess it’s because….I don’t know. I love him! Except I’ve lost sight of why I love him. Perhaps if I pinpoint it, someday, I will be able to move on and continue with my life. I think he will recover too. I hope he has someone in his lifethat can do that for him, aside from himself that is!  I don’t know why I always keep overlooking whatever he has done to me in the past. Last night really hurt though! Am I slowly realizing that he wouldn’t be there for me when I need it most. Duh! It’s not for me to figure out the inner workings of someones mind, but I sure wish I did. Or at least, understand that there is a valid reason. Who knows! I hope he’s ok though!  See that, right now, I don’t feel as bad! There is something to be said about thinking things through, and blogging it at the same time or afterwards.  Of course it always helps to be able to talk to someone about it.   I hope the rest of my day goes better. I am on my home right now.  Think happy pleasant thoughts and patience!

      Well, it's been 4 days since my last entry into this log. For those of you that have been following it may be aware, someone I know is on a rampage. Or, if you want it put the other way, I felt a fight brewing.   Without getting into the gory details of what happened this weekend, suffice it to say that the emotional drain it put on me was a lot. Not to mention all the people that got affected because of it. If I didn't know any better, I would say it could be the beginnings of a soap opera. One I would rather not be a part of, thank you.   A lot of hurtful things were said and done. From where I was at, a lot of it was done to me. Someone who is very dear to me went to a deep end that I would rather not see for a very long time. It's bad enough that I am going through my own rehabilitation, but to couple that with someone who is, I surmise, an alcoholic.   I know the signs, I've seen it all before I've seen it in my life, I know just what's in store But I refuse to be a part of your destruction Especially, shortly after my own eruption  I don't dare to say that I am well It's not a story I dare to even sell I have my own demons to conquer I've got my own ground to cover  But when someone tells you just for today I will stay off the bottle, because it doesn't pay A lot of hurt comes out in what you say To remember it all, I weep and pray  I hope to never see the eye of sadness And the drinks that drove it all to madness All I want is work towards gladness And concentrate on all the happiness  Give me space cause I can't bear to be with you Not in the way, not a love for two Mine is a friendship that will always last But not the way you are, cause that's hurting fast  So, anew we shall for this friendship will be One that both you and I will be happy to see Not necessarily as fast as you desire But one with hope and friendly dire  But for you and me live just for today To stay away from that which brought dismay Just for today work towards your journey back Where happiness will never lack  And that's all I have to say about that!  Thanks to all the Michaels in this world. Where would any of us be without them!

      I began this blog telling you that this will be a journey back to me. Also, I let you know how it all began. Or, at least, I started to. Please keep in mind that I intend to continue to allude to the beginning of my journey. At this stage in my recovery, I think that if I dwell on it too much that it may hinder me from moving on. So, I shall continue to give you piece by piece what made me who I am now. But, in the meantime, enjoy my present, for the past shall make itself known to you as a result of it.

      It's finally occurred to me,  that you refuse to see that my life is not what you want it to be because that would mean that I'm free  Free to be happy with who I am free to be sad when I choose Free to stay up and read a book free to sleep all day, without thinking there's a hook  You're way of thinking is evil and insane And to be honest, what is there to gain You continue to elude yourself from what's true Pretty soon, it'll only just be you  Don't continue with this lest you find yourself alone Find yourself weeping, and nobody on the phone Cause I won't respond to what you insist to be But I'll respond with the friendship, you and me  So sleep my friend and let your conscience be your guide Cause I've told you everything, the door is open wide Out there you'll see that our friendship will be good And perhaps find you in a hell of happy mood!

      It's finally dawned on me! Just tell Michael exactly where it's at and take no other options but that which works best for both. To me, what I told him is exactly what will work best from my standpoint.   1. I pay him $250.00 a month for rent. 2. With that in mind, the very little space underneath the bed should be a place where you can sleep and have your own privacy. 3. The friendship may remain a friendship as oppose to letting him think that he can have you as a boyfriend or lover, despite what you've already told him. 4. It may help you in coming to your own, and perhaps finally get into his head that friendship and having someone at your beckon call and always at your side as a bit too much.  And, lo and behold, I believe it is slowly sinking into his mind that perhaps there is some truth to what others are telling him.  I've noted that 3 other individuals feel the same way. They're names shall go unmentioned but suffice it to say that these people are friends of him. And far be it for friends, for which he tells me he is badly in need of and which is what I am to him, not to point that out to him. However, he refuses to see this. Michael, in your own words, "Beware Thine Foolish Pride". It's something you've always told me and now that someone is using that same lesson back to you, it seems to me that it doesn't work. Whatever happened to the old adage, practice what you preach. How can I respect someone who I hold with such high regard, when the very essence of what you try to teach me is not being practiced. You felt the same way when a friend expressed their feeling to you as to how they perceive you. Playing god, or as others people would put it, being controlling, trying to run some ones life hanging a carrot over someone and lead them to the path that is self serving only to you. All these are wrong and I think you are finally seeing it.   If you don't then there's not a whole lot I can do about that. I've made it known, others have as well. However, I shall walk away from it grateful. And, at this point I am ready to walk away from it so I can continue sorting out my own life. One which is a big deal to me, or rather, wants to move on. Whether that means my eventual passing or continuing my recovery, this journey shall not end here, because this is my journey, my journey back to me!

      You ever have those moments that no matter how you try, someone just gets on your nerves so much that no matter what they do or whatever it is they say, it still wrong. Ever have someone just get so bad as to not wanna take NO or PLEASE STOP as an answer and will just keep talking away regardless if they know or not that they are walking a thin line with your patience.   I had one of those fucked up days! Oddly enough, the thought of escaping from it didn't even occur in my mind. But, words such as shut the fuck up, was one of the things I wanted to say. My roommate has gotten to a point that he has decided that being 65 years old is ok and that no matter what happens, his problems are the most important and nothing else matters.   Never mind the fact that my current state of being, though it has improved quite well, is one of disgust. But, his problem will overshadow that to the point that my problems will go away. Except it won't. And, I am not willing to yield to anyone telling me that their problem is the worse of all and that I would have to give it more attention.   So, two choices present themselves to me. I can either pack up and leave, which is, unfortunately, an option that I can't take but will take if the need arises. Or, put up a good argument to the point that what I'm trying to say is actually understood and perhaps he could back off. I mean, this person has been driving himself to work for years, now all of a sudden it becomes my responsibility to drive him everywhere. Granted I have nothing else going on, but this has been every day!  I don't mind that so much, but all the insults he throws my way is fucked up! So much so that I will start giving it right back. He has become TOO NEEDY that he acts like a little girl with PMS! And, I won't stand for it. AT ALL!  I will take a deep breath now and calmly think that I have to be more understanding because he is old. Also, that he has been nothing but a friend to me. However, he wants more than friendship and I can't give him that. Sure, Sex is Sex, and even that, I don't want to do with him because he reads into it more than what it is.   Here's a guy who, when someone tells him 1 statement, like, "stop playing god" or "someone said this", he will talk to me about it and at great length try to overanalyze it to the point where he has made himself all kinds of things when he isn't even sure why the other person said it. He will go on and on and on about it and beat himself up over it. Yet, he has no basis for it other than the fact that it was said! And, when I try to point it out to him, he refuses to believe it or refuses to admit his shortcomings and continues to do it either way!  Double standards, hypocrisy, and all round full of shit. These are my pet peeves! So, if anyone ever reads this and pursues to get to know me, please keep in mind, other peoples opinion do count and when you realize that it makes sense and that you are in the wrong, be mature enough to admit it to yourself and see if you can come up with a happy medium so it doesn't become bad or makes you loose your cool.  I have, but I swear, if you had to listen to this all day, non stop, and then if you were followed all around the house with the same harping voice, you would know how I feel too.

      The songs been played many times before I've felt death, even, banging at my door I feel the emptiness, such a lonely state devoid of life, a life I've begun to hate  As tears fight overcoming my emotions no tears here,. where'd you get that notion but inside I am hurting. I can't even tell you how you'll Only know me, in what I will allow  I don't even recognize the person that you see even though I realize that that person is me I refuse to go there, afraid of what I'll find a remnant of a person, a life I'd rather leave behind  Gone are the words of solace, but the voices linger on Voices I would rather, if they'd just leave me on my own The noice begins to creep into the door Such is life, but I really don't want anymore  (what this poem means will come clearer to you, stay tuned for the story of my "Journey Back To Me")

      Hi! Blog has been something I have been reading up on for quite a long time. In fact, during one of my drug ridden paranoia, it was quite the center of my fixation! Wait till that story is told! You thought you were normal! I laugh out loud at that thought!  The name of this Blog is called Journey Back To Me. That pretty much explains the primary thread of what I will attempt to share within these pages. Except the journey is more of a symbolic one, so if you're reading this with no appreciation for the down trodden drama ridden recovering crystal meth user, then press the Close button on your browser and have a good life. However, if you should ever be a drug abuser, find your way back! This blog will show you how fucked up you become, or perhaps how someones recovery path can inspire you to get your own drama straigtened out.  My current situation, and I remember it well, began 2 years ago after a Phil Lesh concert at the Greek Theater. It was a good concert, I was high on some hallucinogenic! Boy, it was fun! May 12, 2002 was the date. Or was it 2001. Only time will tell! The concert got out fairly early and I was already 2 shits to the wind, so I decided to go to a friends house. This friend of mine, who I will call Lawrence, was my best friend. At the time I considered him my best friend. Anyways, he had some dope and we dope and hangout together at Spikes on the weekends to get some dancing out of our system. Now, perhaps it is my vanity, but I can dance and wiggle my thing and it seems to attract attention! Hey, I can't help it. I like dancing!  So, anyways, when I got to Lawrence house, there was this 22 year old youngster, whose name, I would come to find out later that evening as Tyler. Tyler looked just like the usual tweaker I've seen Lawrence bring home lately and I know myself enough to know that I can't cross the boundaries. If it is Lawrence's trick, I won't even give it the time of day. It seems that this was his trick and Lawrence was paying him or supporting him. So, I was introduced. And, being my usual self, I asked both of them if they would like to partake in having some of my dinner treats. I happened to have eaten mushroom for dinner and had some left overs. So I wanted to share. So, share I did, and accept they did! Then the dancing fever kicked in. So, we all went to Spikes. Lawrence, Tyler and I. I was still oblivious to Tyler's existence. I couldn't give 2 shits about him, at the time. As a matter of fact he dissapeared later on that evening, only to tell us later that he took a hit of Ecstasy and passed out at someones house. Now, mind you, I still didn't know who Tyler is.  When Lawrence and I got home, early that morning - and yes, Spikes is an afterhour and I love dancing during those hours, Tyler wasn't around. So I went ahead home. A few days later, Lawrence came by the house with Tyler. I suppose, to show him my condo. Tyler was going to be Lawrence assistant. Lawrence, you see, is an interior decorator and my Mom had hired him to do the decorating work at the house. So, of course, my Mom has no idea that Lawrence is a tweaker, who picked up this guy Tyler, I come to find out, from the streets. He was a prostitute. Yes, you're familiar with them. They walk the streets of Santa Monica Blvd. His corner, he would come to tell me later is the one after Highland. Don't ask me the exact name because I try to forget that now. Anyways, Tyler was also an ex-convict, HIV + etc. Come to think of it, I think Tyler uses the HIV + excuse, I don't really think he is but who am I to second guess someone. Also, Tyler is an IV drug user, and the drug of choice is dope!  To be continued...

      It's been a while since I have made an entry into this blog. However, that should be a plus. That isn't to say that I haven't been thinking about it. But, the thought of it becomes easier and easier as the days go on.  Let me clarify. I am not getting that feeling of having the need for it. Not having any money certainly curtails that. But...  I'll continue this later. Someone is looking over my shoulder and I'm not comfortable.  Let me just note what the stars tell me. And, I will begin to follow the stars! At least in all the good things it has to offer. Of course,  I wouldn't loose site of reality.   Hey! It's drug-free!  Oh, also, I thought I saw David Sandoval downtown today. I don't know what this means but it sure would be nice to see him and rekindle our friendship once again! I have missed him so and I think he would be good for my ego and perhaps give me a better perspective on things!            A wind of change will blow on you: you'll want to innovate in your work and your family life. In love, there will be jealousy in the air. You'll have the impression of not understanding your children's reactions at all; be patient, things will sort themselves out. Your fears concerning your material incomes will be renewed; however, it's not by engaging yourself in high-risk investments that you'll be able to save yourself from danger; don't think about the too far away future.

      I stop to think, try to come up with something to say I'll say anything, just to get  you to stay But we both know that ain't happening, ain't no way Cause love ain't here, love ain't  here to stay  Thinking back, trying to make sense of what I'm doing Cause everytime I see you, you're always going You're not even there, at times I need consoling But yet my love for you, damn it won't stop glowing  My heart has gotten use to it, it's become empty you can see it no longer feels to be hurt by you, i guess that means that i'm free free from all the hurt a love can with you can bring to me so now we're friends, let's see where that takes you and me  Tyler I'll never forget you!~

      There is only one proof of ability....results. Men with ability in action get results.  Each man has his own vocation; his talent is his call. There is one direction in which all space is open to him.   Every man was born with the ability to do something well. Every man is a born salesman, accountant, football player, farmer, politician or artist, or something. The individual who uses the ability he was given when he was put on this earth... who works to the very limit of that ability... is doing what the Lord intended him to do.  Don't ask me why I put this here! It's just another day!   And, just for today.....

      The day was Monday, the holiday was Memorial Day. Except, my day will give it a different meaning.   It started at 12:30 PM. I was woken up by the everlasting god of control dome. This one was to start in a culmination of pent up anger that was not going to be completed until it is resolved MY WAY!  Michael, in continuation of his usual bitchy self, woke me up. At 12:30 PM to be exact. I suppose it would not have been too bad, had it not been for him actually waking me up. It was bad enough that I have had to go through his antics the last 2 nights, but to keep it going without letting him know that I had had enough was not to be had.  I lost it! When he woke me up, I was already in a bad mood because I was being woken up despite the fact that I had been kept awake for the last 2 nights for real idiotic reasons. His need to control everything had just gotten to me. Without going into all the details of it, Michael got real violent with me to the point that I drew blood. In a nutshell, he went after me with the small ladder. After all was said and done, I had a bloody face and a fucked up outlook of things to become.   It's been a week since the incident. I am afraid to say that I have had to swallow it in order to stay on. I don't want to leave this place because I do realize that I have it good. However, I think it made strides in getting my point across.   After the bloody face incident, which involved a lot of people. Hey! I had to let everyone know how far it had gotten. And, I think that Michael is aware that everyone is aware of this drama and overly anxious to see how it turns out. Everyone expects me to leave, but I think Michael and I expect things different. I love him! But not in the way he wants it.   I am riding on his guilty feelings at the moment. But I know that it won't last long. I need to get a job.   Perhaps, then I won't feel so bad living here and perhaps I will get my freedom as well as maintain the friendship.  We shall see.  So this new week begins!
