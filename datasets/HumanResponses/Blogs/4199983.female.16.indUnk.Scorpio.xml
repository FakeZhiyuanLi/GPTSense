         Oh, Dio.   My sleeplessness kills me this morning. Don't know why a cup of black tea will work so strong on me. Just a little cup, I went over, rolled over on my bed from 2am to 4am this morning........ Gee, I thought I could have a fine sleep after seeing the fencing of the Olympic (I would say that the result of this sport was also one reason that kept me from having a well sleep.... Italia lose all the way, Cassara and Sanso, they all lose by pityful chances... I'm crying, Dio.) but the truth was totally the opposite from my expectation.   I LOST MY SLEEPNESS!!!   What happened to me last night (this morning) I felt hundreds of ant running over my body (I just had 2 bottles of Ice before I go to sleep, it had never happened to me before!! I was fine with dozons of Ice!!!) that I almost wnet crazy, I could have break the window if I was weak in keeping my temps......      And without thinking, I was like a zombie when in the band practice today. From 10h to 12h, though 2 shourt hours, but hell, it's like being in the fuken purgatory......... I lost all of my felling when singing, and I invisted Cherry to come over, she also felt that I lost something in my voice.... I dared no tell the truth.       Another cheerful news, to me, not for you, fella!! My brother, Curtis Gianluca, and his fella are coming back next week. I think I will be lucky enough to catch up the last fun week. I gotta have them stay up everyday telling me what happened during their vacation to Italia and Switzerland! I heard it crazy fun on the phone...... oops, and almost forgot, I gotta call Jarek up this evening, he is now somewhere in Spain..... I hope to catch the Caneval in Brazil the next Feb. I would try to make this, I promise with my soul!!!!!!      Thanks to this morning's lesson, I think one bottle of Ice before sleep would be pretty enough for me. Ok, I will have only one today (blackberry flavor!!!)  To see if it still act so!!! I will tell you what happen tomorrow. And see you also! Ciao

        [HEADLINE]    Adele-almighty found her music card accelerator today, thought it took her the whole afternoon, but thanks to her super-human intallengence, she concured all the difficulties and created her own solution, now she is happily living with her brand new computer with sound. People, we finally have the right to live without Adele's cries everyday at night. Do have a sweet dream.     [/HEADLINE]      Today is the first free day from summer school. You think I am happy now??? You are WRONG!!! I am bored to death now, even being with my computer for whole day..... I still feel that something is missed out in my life. I couldn't go to anywhere since those stupid boys are being abroad now.... without their car, I'm a piece of lumber... (a rotten one)  You think I didn't think of to do my homework? Then you are WRONG AGAIN!! I did 3 math quiz and 2 pages history reading, that's all. I would not like to study too much, that will hurt my super-human brain..... I will need this to work properlly for me until my 70s......    urlLink   urlLink http://http://www.rollingstone.com/videos/archive?pageid=rs.Videos&amp;pageregion=double1    Check out the link above. I found this band "Papa Rouch" today, with their new hit "Getting away with murder."   OH BABE, I NEED MORE~~~~~~~~~~    you will like this, people!!!

        B B B  Br Bra   Brav Bravo!!!!!   I got a new computer today. Will, not really a new one!! Just my loved friend, Brianna, came to my place for restore my poor little useless computer. And it worked, unbelievable!!!!! So, I'm now living well with my new-born computer, happily enjoying the ADSL speed and effecient process, and blah blah blah..... All the benefits you think sould be lived under a ADSL and Pentium IX user!!!! Ha ha ha!!!  And today, Sunday, Aug 15, an ordinary day to me. Nothing special happened, to be honest. Except the restoration made in my room, I spent all my evening in the in front of the screen and re-feel again the orgasm (i don't meant that!) when touching the keyboard!! Ohhhh Babe, that's how life should be! But, but, and but! My music card (don't laugh, I'm not spelling it wrong! It is how it called in English!!!!) couldn't be driven by the right program. Now I'm using a totally silence computer. Bad and good could be spoken, the good is that I can use it without turnning my speakers on, that would save me a little from the electricity spending (OK, I will try to persuad myself before I type it out next time......). But the opposite is, I will fail to listen to the latest vedio on the Internet.... Damn it, Fox it (from Ba-Boo!) I think I will get it right tomorrow!  And, how's everybody doing today? I hope you are alright, or feel free to be better than alright! That's also fine to me! And would definately be good to all of you! What am I talking about? I think I have a little brain-tied today!!!! So, would you leave me alone form now on!? I new a refresh!!!! Thanks for your sweet, undrstanding comprehensions!!!

      Finally, I was free from the cruel summer school days. What a thing to celebrate..... but due to my poor financial ability, I think I could only give a little ceremony by buying myself a pack of Poca and a bottle of mineral water witch will only cost me no more than NT30!!!!!!!!! Anybody wanna joy me???  Ok, where should I start??? I would like to talk a little about my Brother's vacation now in Italia. He is HAVING FUN now in somewhere in Benevento, the southern city neared Naloles. And he calls me up everyday at about 1am, telling how beautiful his trip is, and how pityful I ain't there having fun with him......... F*** (Ha, since I was the master of this blog, I could spit at whatever, whoever, whenever I wanna spit at!!! I'm kinda out of control now, look at me!!!) him 100 times for this. I will thorw out every his things from his house!!! And open his finest wine, give it to the old man next door!!!! I wish (I thought "wish" is much samiliar to "impossible", right?) I could be there the next year, and then I could be treated as a VIP there. Eatting pasta as every meals there, for breakfast, lunch, supper, hahaha!!!!  I went to the band dry-run today. And we underwent 2 songs, Addicted and Baby hit me one more time. All are fine but my poor voice today. I felt a little bit thorat-tied today, I sounded like a duck crying in the room somehow..... And despite the band's members, today went Vicky, Wai, and Winni. They came by to see how we go, poor me, I was caught vividly for the poor voice, they seemed to be quiet unsatisfied with my duck-liked voice!!! What could I do? Will drink gallons of water hlep? I don't fuckn' think so. Boo them , I will proove mywelf!!! Just you wait, peoople!!!  Here a news to exclaim!!!! I open a new blog today. By the name of "Adi's fella" the web site is:  urlLink www.adisfella.blogspot.com , all are welcome to give your views at anytime!!!!!! Spitting allowed!!! Make yourself!!!

      Salve, it's my first (un....) blog this year!!! BRAVO!!!!  Ok, first I would like to acknowledge that I lost my account for the first registration. I remember singing in with the account "adele*****" but the damn computer just won't work with it. F*** it, I would try to give a proposal to the official center and tell them "You're service is too pityful to find my profile, you should have found my account when I was tuping the first letter of my account......." Suck!!! Anyway, I am here now telling you how I get here. And since, I will try to be here everyday, if everything is fine with me.  I mean if I didn't sleep in, didn't be late to school, didn't be punished by the teachers for not doing my homework, didn't be hit by the blind texi, didn't die for heart attcke..........things like this.  Um..... I can't think of anything to tell you, my fella, now. So, I'm leaving you all now. Ciao, and take care!!!!
