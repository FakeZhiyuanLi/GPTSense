       I'm going to try my best to get an early night today. I didn't get up until gone 3:00pm today, and that's WAY too late to be getting up! I'm not much of a morning person, but staying up late all the time can be doing me any good, so I'm going to try and get some early nights again, and maybe waking up at 10:00am each morning. Wish me luck.  UPDATE: It didn't work! I tried to get to sleep, but could not drop off, so I got up, booted up the computer again and spent the night chatting with Natalie until about 4:00am when I finally felt tired, and managed to get to sleep.

       I've been spending a lot of time over at  urlLink StripCreator.com  since I found it yesterday. It's a fantastic site, one that gives you all the tools you need to make your own comic strip. You can visit my page using here:   urlLink http://www.stripcreator.com/comics/TheWorldofDan/   At some point, once I feel I've got enough funny strips, I'll be putting them up on their own page in the Ninth Dimension section, but until then, be sure to keep checking the site above for my latest work.

       I've not as of yet been to sleep, spent too much time playing with my new project (The Eerie Network) and chatting with Natalie and other friends. Before I knew it, it was 5 AM and I was still awake. As I've got to be available from 8 AM till midday (to give someone some keys), there is little point in me going to bed just yet (if I did, i'd not get up again in time).  Anyway, so I'm now sat here adding more pages to TWoD (you lucky people) and drinking lots of coffee (or as I like to call it, 'Morning Candy').

       My parents are away for the weekend, over to Swansea, I'm guessing to visit family friends Kay and Dave.  Now I'm not one to go planning wild parties (not any more anyway), and I'm definitely not the type of go bragging about it on a site that my parents could read... But it's been such a long time since I've done anything like that, so I'll see what I can arrange... Maybe an en-mass gaming session.

       I'm very happy to announce that I've finally launched  The World of Dan .  The current launch of the site has been in planning for around a year, and in development for 3 months or so, which was mainly due to laziness on my behalf. It even suffered a total of 3 redesigns (for various reasons), but now that it's open, I can say that I'm very happy with the results.  I've not totally finished with the site yet, so over the next few weeks you may notice some minor changes (such as more pages added to the Xepheus section) but over all, what you see now is what you get. I've even got a big idea planned that will effect the whole site, so keep your eyes open for that.  I hope you enjoy my site, and pop back from time to time to watch me on my web cam, or read my blog. Oh, and don't forget to sign my guest book so I know you've been to visit me. Thanx.

       You might think I'm mad... but it's only the 3rd weekend since I started the project of getting TWoD running, and I've changed the site design once again. I was never happy with the dark blue site... I thought it looked good, and might fit someone else, but it's not me. So I've designed a new template (yet again, all my own work, no templates or anything) and am currently in the process of transferring the content from the old site to the new. I quite like the new site design, I can see myself sticking with this one.  Since meeting Lisa via myvideochat.net I've learnt a lot about new web standards (such as XHTML and CSS design) and while I've not yet picked them all up - I've grabbed some - and am running like hell with them. It's good to learn something new. Especially as it's making my job easier. (Thank you Lisa).

       It's now the following weekend from my first entry, and while I have been working on my site, I don't feel I've done anywhere near enough work on it. I have been playing around with the colours: what was once a very dark grey site is now dark blue. I'm not 100% sure that it suits me, but I've used an external CSS style sheet, so if I want to change one of the colours, the whole site will automatically update (I love technology).  I've just got myself one of them IP forwarding sub-domains. It's a little application runs as a service in the background on my computer. Every 3 hours it checks my IP address, and updates the server to reflect this change. From now on, anyone that wants access to my machine can use the following URL (I'll have to keep my firewall updated):   urlLink http://theworldofdan.no-ip.com/   In addition to the IP thingy I've also installed two music tracking plug-ins for Windows Media Player. One of them offers a better website with music tracking features, while the other is better for content (i.e. a dynamic signature for the forum, XML of my recent tracks, JavaScript I can use on this site, etc..). Together they should draw quite an interesting picture of the music I listen to.  Anyway, I'd best get on with my work, I'm about to transfer some of the pages from the old site to the new, then add some new ones (namely: music, web cam, contact me, guest book, etc..). If I feel I've done enough, I'll launch tonight and finish off during the week *fingers crossed*.

       Hi. Welcome to my blog. I've never really kept a journal before, too much hassle I guess, but that's all going to change now - thanx to Blogger.  I was looking into ether building my own blog system from the ground up, or installing a PHP based blog script to my server, but after seeing how much Blogger gives - and how little it asks for in return, I could not say no.  My blog is going to have lots of posts about me, it might contain information on what's going on in my life, rants, links to cool websites, or even the results to them silly internet tests (although I might put them on their own page).  Anyway, my site is still in development at the moment, it's being a pain in the Arse because I can't get the colours right, but I'll keep at it, and with some luck, if I pull my finger out, it'll be done by next weekend... Wish me luck :)

       Yesterday I took my computer to a shop in Sidcup called NSM. They had been the guys that fixed a problem with my mum's computer some time last year, and so I was hoping that they could do the same for mine. I explained that there was a scratching sound coming from hard drive, and that it's been known to overheat, then left it with them.  This morning I got a phone call letting me know the machine was fixed, and I was welcome to go and collect it. One quick trip to Sidcup, and just under 130 pounds later (65 pounds for a new 40GB hard drive - can anyone say rip off, 10 pounds for a new heat sink and fan, and the rest on labor and VAT) I was back home and eagerly setting it up. As I connected all the cables, I visualized myself playing some Dark Age of Camelot and Unreal Tournament 2004, I could not wait.  Initially, Windows XP uploaded up, and looked like it was working. I even managed to get my DVD drive to play a music CD (the drive has been dead for over a year now), but the weird network problem that had ground my machine to a halt was still present (as I expected), so I started the process of reinstalling Windows.  This is where the problems started. It would start loading from the Windows XP CD, but then freeze once it got to the 'Starting Windows' screen. I rebooted and tried again, this time it actually got as far as formatting the drive and starting to install part of the program, and then froze again. Every time I tried to do something, it would get so far, and then stop.  I don't know what the problem is, but I'm fairly sure it's related to the strange network problem that started a few days ago. I'm taking it back to the shop tomorrow in the hope they can fix it, and I truly hope they can, or my plans to turn it into an external web-server, when I get my new computer, will have to be put on hold. That's if I can even get a new computer, if I can't complete the project that's going to pay for it due to this one being out of action, I might as well wave goodbye to all my future plans.  These past few days have not been much fun, but at least something good has come out of all this, the fact I've 'borrowed' and have been using my dad's mini Sony Vaio laptop while my PC has been out of action. It's a fantastic little unit, 6 hour battery, built in web cam and microphone, built in wireless connection, half the size of normal laptops, and fantastic for chatting to your mates while in bed. Although I'll be happy once my computer is fixed, I'll be sorry to have to give this back.  In other news, yesterday my first bank account in something like 2 years was opened. It's with the Co-op Bank, and while it's only a 'Cash Minder' account (an account that even bankrupt people can have), and its debit card is an Electron (the least accepted of all the debit cards), it's better than nothing, and should help me rebuild my credit. I just hope that when World of WarCraft is released, Blizzard accept Electron.

       I don't know much about baseball, but so far as I understand, it's three strikes, and you're out? If this is the case, my computer is currently on it's second strike.  I woke up just before 12:00 noon today (about normal for me) and found my computer was already turned on (this is weird, but I think I might have woken early, turned it on, then went back to sleep). I went to log into MSN Messenger, but found that before it even tried to connect, I got an error message ("Signing into .NET Messenger Service failed because the service could not be found. Please make sure that you are connected to the Internet. 0x81000302"). After a brief look around my system I soon discovered that, for whatever reason, my network adaptor was not working... but more so than that, ALL network features were down (including my ability to connect to 'localhost').  My parents are still away on holiday at the moment, not back till very late tonight, so the soonest I'm going to be able to take it into a shop, and have it looked at is tomorrow, meaning I probably won't have it back myself until at least Wednesday.  When I do take it in, I'm going to ask them about the possibility of a minor upgrade, maybe a new processor and some extra RAM (say a 2ghz processor and 512mb's RAM, depending on price), and a new hard drive, which is what I believe the root of all my problems is, although I've not had any scratching sounds today.  Anyway... wish me luck.

       Against all my better judgements, I've been tempted to return to the realm of Albion, and start playing Dark Age of Camelot again. I plan on playing a Necromancer called Xepheus, and exploring all the parts of Albion that I never got to explore the first time around. I'm also looking forward to some of the new features the game is meant to have added (such as player housing, something I'm very keen on trying out), and returning to RvR combat (which if I'm honest, I do miss a lot).  I guess that this should hold me until World of WarCraft is released... I just hope that god has mercy on my soul!   UPDATE:  Camelot was not as bad as I remembered. Many times, since we all first left the game (for reasons I can't even remember now), I've been back to Camelot, but as I've always been on my own, as a result of boredom, I've not lasted much longer than a couple of days (if that). This time I was with Nichol, and as we was grouping, and working together, it was not that bad because I had someone to talk to.  We started in Albion, and both created new characters (I had Xepheus my Necromancer). After a couple of hours we got them both got to level 5 (for anyone that has played the game, you know what it means to get to level 5), then logged out for dinner.  After dinner we then moved into Midgard and resurrected our old guild 'The Army of the 12 Monkeys' (starting to see a trend with our guild names yet?). Because all of my characters in this realm had been deleted, I started a new fighting class character called Cepheus (meaning 'The King', which is where I originally got the name Xepheus from), and with a little help from Nichol (and his level 45 'buff-bot' Shaman), I got Cepheus to level 8 (pausing for a moment to turn him into a berserker at level 5).  We're going to play again tomorrow, probably for the whole day, and with luck should get Cepheus to at least level 20 so we can enter the battlegrounds (along with one of Nichol's other characters, he's got tons, all of different levels in this realm). I'm looking forward to the RvR, although when I first played the game I was not a huge fan of it, over time I've grown to appreciate how much fun I actually had within the battlegrounds.  If we get into the game again, we'll start inviting new members into the guild, and have a proper go at it again (same as before, supporting the crafters with money, etc..), if not, we'll play the game till we get bored, then pack it up again. At least we gave it a try, and at any rate, playing DAoC should get us in the mood for World of WarCraft once it's release (at which point I'm going to drop everything I'm doing and dive in head first).

       Ain't it a bitch? You wait forever for a fantastic gaming offer, then two come along at once... First of all I should like to draw your attention to the  urlLink Tribes 2 site , and their latest news posting:    We're celebrating the upcoming release of Tribes: Vengeance by  giving away Starsiege&reg;: Tribes&reg; and Tribes 2 for free  on a special-edition DVD-ROM bundled with the newsstand edition of the June issue of Computer Gaming World magazine and online via FilePlanet.com. The giveaway is meant to celebrate the fourth-quarter release of Tribes: Vengeance, the next installment in the venerable Tribes franchise of PC action games.  That's right, you can now download and play the fantastic Tribes 2 game for nothing. Sierra have had this tradition of giving away old games when new ones are released, I just hope that this extends to things like Half-Life now that Half-Life 2 is near completion.  Now head over to  urlLink this page on Fileplanet.com :    Turbine Entertainment Software has partnered with GameSpy to offer the full version of  Asheron&rsquo;s Call 2: Fallen Kings for purchase of only $12.95  through FilePlanet! This purchase will give you your CD Key and a location to download the client will be given on your key page and by email.  Once again, a fantastic offer that I think people would be foolish not to take up. You want to know the only bad thing about it? I already own both these games, so I've missed out on some fantastic offers, but this does provide me with a fantastic excuse to play both these games again, so it's all good.

       My computer has calmed down a lot since yesterday, it will boot up after about 10 minutes of weird scratching sound, but once it's booted, it works fairly well. So far only crashed while playing a game (Neocron, I was driving someone across the wastelands, and it crashed while I was zoning.. I hope he got to his destination), so it should last me for at least the weekend.  I was going to take it into a computer shop today, but as my parents are away from tomorrow for the weekend (again, woo hoo), so I won't be able to collect it again until Tuesday, which is a bit too long for me to be without a computer, even with access to my mum's one.  Not only that, but I want to play City of Heroes again tonight, it's the last night of beta, and as a result they are staging a server event, an alien invasion for everyone to help fight off.. should be tons of fun :D  If all goes well tomorrow, I'll write my CoH review for TheICE.co.uk, and then start working on my two new Fight Club Monkey / League of Extraordinary Monkeys websites. Oh, and I'm meant to be getting the files I've been waiting for from Rail Gourmet, so I can start their project, and actuality get paid for it (watch out new computer, here I come) so I'm going to be a busy boy.  UPDATE: I missed out on the server event. My computer obviouly had other plans for me because it would not run the game. Oh well...

       My computer is truly on it's last legs... I can't even turn it on without it freezing every 5 minutes. And that horrible scratching sound that comes from the hard drive is driving me crazy. Luckily I'm able to use my mum's computer to do things like post this message and check my email.  I'm going to see if I can pull together £40 to buy myself a new hard drive from PC world later, then start the whole process of formatting the drive, and reinstalling everything... again!! Wish me luck.

       I got an email inviting me into the City of Heroes beta today. I would have posted this message earlier, but I was too busy being excited about actually getting a beta spot for once. I have to admit that it's a total shock that I got into beta, I was not expecting it at all. I only added my name to the site after I saw Justin on TheICE.co.uk posting about how he had got in, so I though "what the hell". I got the email just before 7:00 pm, started the download just before 8:00 pm, waited 3 hours for the client to download, then started playing at around 11:00 pm. And have been playing solid up until now (just before 3:00 am).  I'm not a huge super hero fan, never have been. There is one super hero comic series that I follow on an on/off basis called The Authority, but they are not like normal super heroes. I was not planning on getting the game due to my lack of interest in super heroes, but now that I've played it for a while, I might change my mind about that. Not because I've gained a sudden interest in the genre, but because this game shows that true promise.  I'm not someone to be won over easily when it comes to a games graphics, but I was highly impressed at the fact I've got an old (ish) computer, and yet the engine running the game run very well. I did get pockets to graphical lag, especially when in a busy location, but it was easily ignored. And the graphics actually looked good despite the age of my rig. Game play wise, so far it's a very standard MMORPG affair, but highly advanced from any MMORPG's I've ever played before.  Before you can do anything, you need to make your character, design their look, and give them a funky name. Similar to the 'race' and 'class' selections of a fantasy game, this lets you choose from 5 different 'origins' (such a mutant, magic, natural) and 5 'archetypes' (such as blaster, tank, scrapper). After this, based on your choices, you choose what initial abilities you want, then move onto designing what the character looks like. This is where the game shines, for once you can truly look unique to everyone else in the game.  According to the  urlLink City of Heroes website , "Our bank of supercomputers has calculated the number of distinct costume combinations available in the game at somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2.24 x 10 to the 24th. Give or take a few million." Which is a hell of a lot of customisation. Personally, due to my choosing of a magical origin, I went for something very mystical: a dark blue outfit with a hood and mask covering my face, and glowing magical symbols covering it's surface. (I'll get a screenshot soon). After choosing a name (Xepheus... what else would I be?). I entered the game.  You are initially greeted with a tutorial explaining the basics of combat, experience, and items, etc. After a few simple missions, you are let loose into paragon city, ready to wreak havoc with the gangs that make the streets unsafe.  I've not got very far into the game yet, and would not like to make too many comments in the way of game play, but I will soon. So be sure to keep an eye on the reviews forum over at  urlLink TheICE.co.uk  for my full review.

       Thanks to some of my very good friends, my chillout music collection has doubled in a matter of hours. I'm now the proud owner of most the albums by the following fantastic artists:  Air   Boards of Canada   DJ Shadow   Enigma   Groove Armada   Massive Attack   Zero 7  Be sure to keep an eye on my  urlLink My Audioscrobbler Page  to see how much I listen to all this new music (it's going to be a hell of a lot over the next few weeks).

       Another day in 'Blizzard land', and one of the World of WarCraft game developers comes up with a new and fantastic 'innovate' idea for WoW... and everyone complains (even though out of everyone that is complaining, none of them are in beta, so none of them truly know how it's going to effect the game).  This new idea is the concept of 'resting', here is what the WoW site says about it:   Rest State    The Rest state modifier only affects experience earned from killing monsters. It does not affect experience earned from quest rewards or other experience rewards in the game (such as future PvP experience rewards).  As players kill monsters and gain experience points, they become increasingly tired. Their rest level reflects this tiredness in five tiers: well rested, rested, normal, fatigued and exhausted.  Well-rested players receive bonus experience points for killing monsters. Rested players receive a smaller bonus. At the normal rest level, players receive no bonus experience points for killing monsters. Fatigued players receive half of the normal experience points from their kills, and when exhausted they will receive a quarter of normal experience from a kill.  To become well rested and start earning bonus experience from killing monsters again, players must either log out or rest online at an Inn (see below) for several hours.  Thanks to the comforts of a warm bed and a hearty meal, players who rest or log out at an Inn can regain energy up to the maximum level: well rested (it takes 8 hours to go from exhausted back to well rested). Players who log out anywhere else in the world will only regain energy up to the normal level.  Note that while your character is resting at an Inn, you can play other characters on your account. The rest state is per character only. Now this sounds like a great idea to me, it will give people an excuse to go off and do something else, something other than the classic level grind that so many other MMORPGs suffer from.  WoW is not designed to be a level grind game in the first place. It's designed around the idea of questing... some people will find this idea hard to get into, and might find themselves in a level grind situation, god knows why though, it's almost as if they enjoying repeating the same activity for hours on end: (pull, kill, pull, kill, pull, kill, pull, kill, pull, kill, rest, pull, kill)  This new rule will encourage them to start exploring the world, and doing something else instead with their time, something fun. They could participate in some quests. Maybe help defend their lands from the opposing faction in the PvP arenas. Learn to fish at a nearby lake. Or even take up crafting in a local village. You never know, but it might even make some people want to go have drinking contests in the local taverns, I know that I'm going to do this at least once.  I truly find it hard to swallow that people would prefer the 'same old same old' ideas rather than something truly ' innovate'. What's wrong with people today?

       I've been playing Lineage 2 for the last couple of days, and I'm highly  unimpressed ... It's lacking a hell of a lot of content, and is relying too much on it's graphics (which to me don't look all that because I've not got a top of the range computer anymore).  An example of how it's lacking content is the fact that the first quest for each race is the same: After a very quick tutorial on how to move, you go and visit the village elders. They will command you with a quest to go and retrieve four fox fangs. After doing this, you'll soon find yourself being sent to an NPC in a local village, and then being told to go away until you are level six, left on your own to level up (treadmill anyone). As a Dwarf, there was one quest available to me... I had to go and kill 40 black wolves, and take their pelts back to some mad old woman... Fun!  I realise that the game is still in beta (and it shows, word wrap doesn't even work), but so far as I understand, this is a direct (bad) translation of the Korean version, which is currently live, and supposedly the best game in Korea... Yeah right!! I'm going to uninstall this game now, I'm not in the mood for more treadmill game play, I got fed up with that while I was playing Dark Age of Camelot.

       Went to see Shaun of the Dead this morning... It's great, very funny, highly recommenced. It's what I would class as a 'funny horror' rather than a comedy, i.e. it's a horror film first and foremost, but with lots of funny moments in it. It's very well written, and takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions as the story unfolds.  If you liked Spaced: watch it! If you like comedy: watch it! If you like horror films: watch it! Best British film in a long time.

       I've spent some time today updating TWoD, not much had changed though, I've just smoothed off a few rough edges, etc.. The biggest change is that of the  Photo  Gallery becoming an  Image  Gallery. "What's the difference?" I hear you cry... The type of image it hosts:  Before, the gallery was just for photos of my friends and I, and the outings we went on, etc. Now it's also going to be used to host different images of me, i.e. cartoons, avatars, etc.. I'd like to say a big thank you to  urlLink Darwinian Theory  for the  urlLink two images  he done of me via my  urlLink web cam .  Expect to see more photos of me as I approve them for viewing in the near future... So keep checking back for updates.

       It turns out that there is a mouse loose in our house somewhere. So far as I understand, it spends most of it's time in the kitchen (I'm guessing under the floor boards), but I think that it explores the rest of the house at night.  Krystal (our cat) is on full alert, and determined to catch it...

       I got my ear re-pierced today. My mother, using a large and rusty kebab skewer, held me down, and jabbed it at my ear until she finally hit the spot I wanted. Lots of pain, lots of blood, lots of extra holes I didn't want.. but that's life.  LOL, na, it didn't really happen like that. It was a simple procedure, I had two holes in my ear already, they just needed to be reopened. So, using the thinnest earring she had, my mother just pushed the hole though, and it was done.. no pain, no fuss.  I used to wear earrings all the time, but had to take them out when I worked for FoneWank. I've not worked for them for a long time, but never really thought about wearing them again, until today. I'll have to go out and find some cool rings or studs over the weekend, I'm thinking something slightly gothic, blacked silver or something, but nothing over the top.

       I hate getting involved in flame wars on forums, in my opinion they are all totally pointless and can never be won by ether side, as illustrated by the following quote:   "There is no point arguing with idiots. All they do is drag you down to their level, then beat you with their experience" -  Unknown .   But on this occasion I could not help myself.. I had to get involved because I was standing up for what I believe in. This war was based around the correct usage for the word  urlLink "Gay" . Allow me to explain:  I've been making comics on the  urlLink Stripcreator.com  site for a few days now, and for the most part I've been very much enjoying my time on the site, even going as far as recommending the site to a number of my friends.  A few days ago I went into the sites forum and decided to post a selection of my work in their feedback forum (titled "Read My Damn Comic" or RMDC for short). I was posting the message in good faith that I would get some honest feedback from some of the regulars, and maybe some hints on improving my comics (which I admit myself could have been better).  All I got was insults.  One of the site's members, MickeyG, came along and posted in the largest font he could, that my comics were Gay. At first I told him to fuck off if he had nothing nice to say, waiting for more normal feedback from other members. This was my first mistake.  He came back with some lame arse excuse that he was not flaming because it was the RMDC forum, and as such all feedback was valid. He then went on to say that he did not mean the word Gay in a homosexual reference, but in a corny or cheesy way.  For a start I don't class calling something gay as being feedback. Feedback is when you take the time to look at something, and point out, in detail, it's faults as well as praises. If you think that something is bad, by all means say so, but also say why, back it up with some valid reasons. Secondly, anyone that knows me knows that I don't like people using the word gay as an insult. Not because I'm being insulted, but because they are insulting a whole way of life. It's as bad as people who use racist words to describe people of different colours (words which I will not repeat here).  I know that I should have stopped at this point, I know that I should have been the better person, and just ignore it, but this person was plainly trying to be offensive, and cause as much chaos as he could, so I decided to reply to this message with a comic I titled  urlLink English for Retards .  In reply he decided to quote  urlLink Dictionary.com , and put the following on the site:   Gay. Adj. 1. Of, relating to, or having a sexual orientation to persons of the same sex. 2. Showing or characterized by cheerfulness and lighthearted excitement; merry. 3. Bright or lively, especially in color: a gay, sunny room. 4. Given to social pleasures. 5. Dissolute; licentious.   He highlighted the 5th entry stating "That last definition is definitely a negative thing". I had no idea what Dissolute or Licentious meant, but after looking them up, it's obvious that he didn't ether. In an effort to backup my argument, I posted their meanings on the forum:   Dissolute. Adj. 1. Lacking moral restraint; indulging in sensual pleasures or vices.    Licentious. Adj. 1. Lacking moral discipline or ignoring legal restraint, especially in sexual conduct. 2. Having no regard for accepted rules or standards.   A few more insults were fired, and I felt like giving up, walking away in defeat, but my good friend Natalie came to my defence.. it felt good to have someone fighting in my corner, and let me tell you, she's far better at flaming than me. She puts it down to the fact that when she's given the opportunity to attack "immature 12 year olds who think they know it all", she takes it.  The rest is messy, and far too much to go into detail with. I shall highlight this one point however.  MickeyG, supported by his little group of friends, defended his usage of the word gay by saying "For the love of GOD. YOU are gay. Have you never seen an episode of South Park? I'm apparently not the only one who has used the word 'gay' this way. Shaddap". Personally I found this funny, he was basing his entire argument on a TV show.  When we tried to point out how retarded it was to do such a thing, he and his mates kept saying things like: "They obviously don't have the brainpower required to understand the satirical part of it". I admit that I've enjoyed it from time to time, and thought that the movie was was very well done, but people need to learn the difference between reality and fantasy, and not choose to base their lives on cartoons.  I called a ceasefire last night. I told them they could go on about it as much as they wanted, but I was not going to get involved anymore. I did however go back and post one last message, explaining my position because someone had the wrong end of the stick. They posted "maybe if you knew what gay meant before he told you, then this fight wouldn't have started". I knew what he meant when he call my strip gay, I was just trying to educate him on how it was wrong to use the word in this way.  Anyway, it's all over now, thank you to everyone that helped me in this little war, I doubt that we've made any difference to these peoples lives, but then that's up to them. If you want to read the thread and argument in full, go  urlLink here .

       Hi, sorry for the lack of updates but nothing much has been happening in my life, nothing all that interesting anyway.  My laptop is still being a bitch. I'm getting blue screens of death and the occasional freeze-up on average at least once a day, and no idea what's causing it. I phoned up Evesham tech support and asked for help, but all they could do is suggest that I format and reinstall everything... thanks guys, real help there! At least they let me know who the motherboard and chassis manufacturer is, now I can download the latest drivers for everything.  My PDA has 'broken' :). I've had to call it in to be collected and repaired, but the truth is I'm hoping they can't repair it, that way, they have to supply me with a brand new one... They were meant to come collect it yesterday, but so far no one has showed up. Oh well, I'll phone them tomorrow and complain (it's OK though, gives me more time to break it a little more – whoops, did I just drop that hammer).  My dad has taken two weeks off work to do some building in the garden, so for the next two weeks I'm going to hide in my bedroom, and hope to not get in his way. So far as I understand it, the green house we currently have is going to be moved further back the garden, and in it's place, a 'den' for my dad is going to be placed. I think he wants somewhere to store all the tools he has been buying, and I guess he's going to use it as a work shop when/if he retires (although I guess that's still a few years away yet).  Last thing, I've finally had some files for the Rail Gourmet project sent to me, for me to start learning how the developer has coded it... but these are still not the finished product, and as such I still can't start any actual coding... What's even more funny is that this project now has a deadline of the end of the month...  yeah, right!  Anyway, I guess that's all for now, I'll try to keep this thing updated more often, but unless something interesting starts to happen, I won't have anything to update it with. Oh, and keep your eyes on the 'Xepheus' section of the site, I'm going to start working on adding some content soon, you lucky people you :)

       I've just had a leaflet promoting the BNP posted though the letter box. I ripped it up as soon as I saw what it was, and I hope that everyone else does the same.  For anyone that does not know, the BNP (British National Party) are a political party akin to the Nazi party. They claim to have Brittan's best interests at heart, but the truth is, they are nothing but a collection of racist thugs.  I would much rather support the  urlLink Anti Nazi League .

       If I ever get my hands on one of the many virus authors that live in the world, I will make them wish they had never been born. In case you've not already figured it out, I managed to get myself infected with a virus today. The Win32:Netsky-P worm. As I talk, I'm franticly running as many virus checks as I can in a bit to fully remove it.  It was a virus you get in an email pretending to be a text document. I'm normally shit hot on seeing them for what they are, and deleting them, but this one slipped past me.  As I'd only just installed Outlook (and had not yet installed an anti-virus programs - naughty), I had around 50 emails to download. I was sorting them out, seeing what I had, and deleting all the junk (which was most of it).  As I'd just signed up for a PayPal account, I had a whole bunch of emails from them. One of them, the last one of the bunch, had a title of "attached is your bill". I should have heard warning bells, but before I knew what was going on, I had opened the zip attachment, and run the file enclosed. I knew within a second what I had done, but it was too late.  Anyway, as I say, I'm currently running a whole bunch AV programs to remove it, I just hope it's not caused too much damage.

       My laptop has been delivered. I can't believe it's here already, so quickly.  Yesterday I was going out of my mind, thinking about how it was going to be at least another week before I could use it. But today, just after 12 noon, there was a knock on the door, and a very nice man holding a box said "delivery from Evesham for you"... I was shocked.  I've been playing around with it for the last couple of hours. I've installed 3D Mark 2003 and run it's tests (got a score of 2575), and I've installed FarCry (which I purchased yesterday), it looks amazing.  I'm currently formatting the hard drive and installing XP Pro... I've got it, I might as well use it. As with every new computer, it's loaded up with a whole ton of crappy software that I'll never use, so I might as well start a fresh.  I have noticed two minor problems however... First of all, the volume is very quiet. Even with both the software volume, and the volume control on the case, turned up, it's whisper quiet. I'm hoping that installing XP Pro might fix this. Second of all, the USB ports are very tight, and at first did not want to recognize the USB mouse I had plugged in, but I swapped it for another that I've got, and it worked fine. Oh, and the free case I managed to wangle has not been delivered yet, but I phoned them about that, and it's being delivered tomorrow.  Anyway, I must dash, need to go look after my computer. I'll keep you updated though. :)

       For the past few days I've been waking up with a very sore throat. The pain and total lack of lubrication would prevent me from even being able to speak. It would take at least half an hour of sucking Halls Soothers, and drinking Lemsip, before feeling better. Luckily today, however, it was not so painful. Although my throat is still bad, and I've been coughing up flem all day (plus now my ears hurt every time I swallow for some strange unknown reason), it's obvious I'm on the mend (YAY!!).  I've had to swap laptops today. I've been using my dad's mini half-size Sony Vaio since my desktop computer stopped working almost 2 weeks ago, and although I've ordered myself a new laptop, it's still 8 days away. In the meantime however my dad needs his one back, so I've got permission to use my mum's laptop. It's a Dell Latitude, and although not as powerful as my dad's one (and very slow), it has a full-size keyboard and monitor, so it's all good (after all, I only need it for checking my email and chatting on MSN).  Talking of computers, I've started to feel some strange computer game withdrawal symptoms. Although I do have my GameCube and GameBoy Advance, I'm a PC gamer at heart, and it's games such as Unreal Tournament 2004, Painkiller, and Dark Age of Camelot that I'm longing for. All I can say is that 8 days delivery is about 8 days too many.  In other news, now that I'm starting to get myself into order, and have my bank account set-up, etc.. I've also signed up for a PayPal account. I'm able to take donations using it, and so I'm hoping that some of the regulars on  urlLink TheICE.co.uk  might be willing to help towards some of the site's running costs (click the link on the sites home page).  While we're on the subject of money, I've signed up for a sellers account at eBay, and listed my first auction ( urlLink Dark Age of Camelot & Shrouded Isles Collectors Edition ). If this item sells well, I've got a whole host of other games and items I can sell using eBay, I just need to see what happens (I'll keep you updated).

       I've kept fairly quiet about this in case for any reason it didn't happen, but since my computer went down I've been looking into buying a laptop. At first I was going to buy a very basic one just for work, one I could use to complete the Rail Gourmet project, and then fork out the cash for a nice and powerful desktop after I had been paid for it. But I soon realised that I could not afford to buy both a laptop and desktop, so I decided to spend a bit more on the laptop, and find a spec. that would last me a few years as a desktop replacement.  Anyway, I've been comparing prices, getting feedback from a laptop forum, even taking a trip up London to test drive some of the systems. And now, I've not only chosen the laptop of my dreams, but have indeed ordered it:   urlLink Evesham Voyager 6400 A30   AMD Althlon 64 3200+ Processor (upgraded from the 3000) 1024 MBs RAM (upgraded from 512) 60GB Hard Drive 15.1" SXGA+ TFT Screen (1400x1050) ATI Mobility Radeon 9600 128MB DVD/CD-RW Drive Internal Modem and Network 4 x USB, Firewire, Printer Port, etc.. I even managed to get a free case out of the deal. All of that for the fantastic price of just below 1250 pounds. According to the salesman, it will be delivered in 9 days time... I can't wait.

       I feel like shit at the moment, since Sunday evening I've had a sore throat. At first I thought it might have had something to do with the beer I was drinking (it started while I was drinking it), but it's now three days later, and it's getting worse, and spreading. My nose is stuffy, my throat is VERY sore, I find it hard to swallow and talk because of the pain, and when I am able to speak, I sound like Barry White.  It's annoying because I've had to cancel a meeting with a potential client, I didn't think I would have given the best impression. Anyway, as I'm sure you can tell, I'm not in the best mood at the moment, but with some luck, later today I'm going to make a purchase that should help cheer me up. I'll let you know what once I've brought it.

       I was going to cry for most of the weekend, then take the computer back to NSM on Tuesday, but one quick phone call to my friend Rob has changed all of that... my computer is now actually working again. Thank you Rob.  I phoned Rob and explained everything that has happened up until this point, he suggested that I pull out all non-essential hardware and try again. So after pulling out both the network card and sound card, and disconnecting my DVD drive, I started to install Windows 2003 Server. Don't ask me why I chose this over XP, I've no idea, all I do know is that I had tried to install this before, and it didn't work, so this was as good a test as any. As I'm sure you can tell, it worked. It installed perfectly, no errors, no freezing, nothing like that at all. I'm just so glad that it's working.  I've now got a good idea of what might be at fault: my network card. I don't know why, but it all seems to fit. back when I had my weird 'network' problem, I didn't believe it could be the network card, because the problem was not limited to just external network connections (i.e. connecting to my localhost Apache server didn't work), and back when it initially happened, I though it was related to the scratching sound hard drive problem, but now I've got a new hard drive, have had all these other problems, I it can't be that. It was just weird timing.  I need to start reconnecting all the hardware to see if I can prove it's the network card at fault. Because of this I'm leaving the network card till last. I highly doubt it's my sound card as I was able to listen to music even during my network problems, and I doubt it's the DVD drive because that's not been connected in months. I also believe it's the network card because of the points the install has frozen... points at which it could be looking for a network connection.  Anyway, I'm off to do that now, I just wanted to post an update while I was in a good mood. I'll update you more later.  UPDATE: It was the network card, this has been confirmed. When I plugged it in, the computer stopped working. As soon as I took it out and plugged it one my friend Nichol lent me.. it started working again. I'm just reinstalling everything now. Oh, and come Tuesday, I'm going to phone up NSM and let them know what I think of them, money grabbing bastards.  UPDATE 2: My computer is still not working. I went into the 'Windows Update' site and downloaded all the updates and drivers, such as I have done many times in the past, but after rebooting the machine froze again. I tried to reinstall Windows again from scratch, but once again didn't work.  I've decided to pull out the new network card, and unplug anything that's not totally needed. I'm going to try and get Windows installed with minimum options in an effort to just try and get it working, so I can do what I need to do for the Rail Gourmet site. If this does not work, then I truly don't know what to do next.

       My computer is still on the blink. I took it back to NSM yesterday and explained the problems I've been having. Within a few hours I was invited to go and collect it. When I asked what the problem was, he just shrugged me off saying something about the new hard drive being at fault, and that he has replaced it with another one. He would not give me a straight answer about future installs, or how he had installed Windows (looking back, I believe he may have bodged it, after all, he was doing this for free).  I got it home, turned it on, and Windows loaded. I checked for a network but had no joy. I tried to set-up the network, but similar to my initial problem of a few days ago, none could be found. I decided to reinstall Windows in the hope that with it being connected to our network on set-up, it would find the network it easier. In went the Windows CD, it loaded up, the install process started, and so far as I could tell, everything was going well. All the points at which the install had failed before had come and gone without error. It looked like I finally had a working computer. I was wrong.  I glanced over at the computer and saw it was at the '34 minute till completion' mark, and was currently 'installing devices'. I went away to find some coffee, and returning 5 minutes later, was expecting it to need some information from me (I've installed Windows so many times I almost know the process off by heart), but it was still at the 34 minute mark, not having budged at all. I waited, and waited, and then waited some more, but it would not shift from that point. In other words, my computer had frozen again, and was not in fact fixed at all.  I've tried to install Windows a few more times since, but it keeps freezing. At this point I don't know what's wrong with the computer, and can't even imagine what to do to try and fix it. I've known for a while that it was on the way out, but I was hoping it would last at least another month, until I was able to buy myself a new one. I need the computer now more than at any time in the past because without it, I can't complete the Rail Gourmet project, the one that's going to pay for my new computer.  On Tuesday (because Monday is a bank holiday) I'm going to phone NSM again, and ask them what they think the problem is, but if I’m honest, I don't expect to get much of a reply from them. After this I'm going to look though the phone book and see if I can find someone that will actually come out to visit me to fix it, this way I can show them the problem first hand, and watch them working, I fear this will be very expensive however, and am not looking forward to having to do this. In the mean time, I'm going to try installing some other operating systems on it, maybe Windows ME and/or Linux. Anything that will give me a work space to complete the rail gourmet project, which is very much my priority at the moment. Wish me luck.

       I went riding on my bike today for the first time in at least 2 years. Previous to this, the last time I had ridden was when I worked for FoneLink (evil evil evil), I would cycle to work and back each day. Anyway...  I was meeting a friend of mine (Chill) at a local pub for a swift pint and a friendly chat. I'm not sure what prompted me, but I had an urge to use my bike, I'd been looking for an excuse for the past 2 months or so, and this was perfect. The way I saw it, I had a choice, either walk it, which would take around 25 minutes, or cycle it, which would only take 10. So of course, being me, I took the easy option (or so I thought) and cycled it.  I had truly forgotten how hard riding a bike can be, especially for someone like me - a bit overweight - and whose job involves sitting down behind a computer all day. Before I set off, I had a quick once around the block to ensure that the bike was still working OK, but even that tiny trip left me out of breath.  Anyway, so off I set, got to the pub, spent around 10 minutes outside trying to get my breath back before going in. Met Chill, had a nice chat about computer games, the internet, money, jobs, and stuff, and then after around 2 hours or so, set off back home again.  Even now, as I sit at my desk typing this (tucking into a burger and chips - which I brought as a reward for being healthy - LOL), I've still not fully got my breath back, and indeed feel quite knackered, but it felt good to be active.  When I go out I'm fairly active anyway. Seeing that I can't drive, I need to walk everywhere, which I don't mind, but riding the bike was a step up the health ladder in my opinion. I'm looking forward to Wednesday evening, when I'm going to cycle to another pub (further away) for a pub quiz with my friends, which should be a  laugh. And next weekend hopefully, when Chill and I might go for a cycle in the countryside.  If I get into cycling again, I might even buy myself a new bike, we'll just have to wait and see what happens.

       Up and down Brittan today, and all over Europe over the next few days, millions of people are going to be voting in the European elections. I've done my bit, my duty to my country, and have been up to my local polling station to place my vote.  For the Mayor of London election I've voted Labour / Ken Livingstone as my main choice, with The Green Party / Darren Johnson as my second choice. Both the other two votes went to Labour.  Why have I voted Labour? Since Labour got into power back in 1997 (following the Conservative party rule of around 18 years), in my opinion they've not done anything wrong. I'd not say that that I was a Labour supporter, or even truly understand what they stand for, but they seem to be doing a good job, so why change?  Why have I voted for The Green Party? I think this has to do with my newly found interest in paganism and my love of nature. A lot of the progress in the western world has come about at the expensive of nature, and I feel this needs to stop. I'm not saying stop development, I'm just saying don't develop at the expense of nature. Another key reason I've voted green is because of their commitment to "putting an end to all forms of racism, sexism and homophobia", a big plus in my book.  Why am I voting at all? Back when I was younger, I once decided that I was going never going to vote. I didn't see the point in it as I didn't understand politics, or what any of the parties stood for. I still don't, the difference now is that I recognise if I don't vote, I've giving fascist parties the chance to get into power, and that's the last thing I want to happen. I hate the BNP and what they stand for, and would truly hate for them to get into power.  So I've done my bit, and placed my vote, now I've just got the wait and see what happens.

       I went to my first 'moot' today (a moot is just a cool pagan way of describing a gathering of people). It was in a Gay pub in London called The Kings Arms just around the corner from Oxford Street Tube.  I found out about the moot as a result of joining a Yahoo Group earlier this week - Gay Pagans UK. I was initially just looking for pagan groups, it just so happened that the only decent one I could find was a gay one (more on this later), so I joined up, said hello, and almost immediately got invited to the moot.  I was with my friend Caroline. At first we didn't know if we were going to attend the moot or not, we just knew we were going to enjoy a night up town. Starting in Greenwich, we walked down to the market and Cutty Sark via the park, stopped off for a quick beer, then decided what to do next...  As I'd been invited to the moot, and we didn't have anything better to do, we decided that it should be our next destination. Next stop, The Kings Arms (via an hour wasted waiting for a friend in the city, but never mind).  Now I've never been in a gay pub before, and let me tell you, it was an interesting experience. As I'm sure you can imagine, it was full of men. Lots of big men in fact, many with piercing and tattoos, some with shaven heads, some with bleached blond hair, etc...  As I walked in with Caroline I felt like every eye in the room was on us, but not in a threatening way (at least I hope not). Something else which I noticed about the pub was that it was full of safe sex literature, on the walls, in the form of leaflets, everywhere... Why can't other pubs help to promote safe sex this much?  The pagan group was upstairs, so up I went, over to a group of people in the corner, and proudly announced 'Hi, I'm Daniel' (which I'm very proud of, being the shy person I am). It was a bit awkward for the first minute or so, but the leader of the group introduced himself and a few of the others, and despite my shyness, I was talking with a few of them towards the end of the evening.  I don't know how long we were there for, maybe an hour and half (if that), but it was long enough to say hi, put some faces to names (even though I failed in that regard, thanks to my weird and forgetful brain), and get used to the idea of meeting other pagans (which is nice). After this we stopped off at a nice little cafe, had some dinner, then found our way home. A very good night all in all.  Now about the whole 'gay' thing. Like I said before, my primary reason for joining the group was that it was the only good pagan group available on Yahoo. All the others had a lack of members, or were just not local to me (what's the point in joining one based in Ireland after all?). However the fact it was gay is also a bit of a blessing... I've recently decided to formally change my status, relating to my sexuality, from straight to 'bi-curious'.  What does this mean? Well initially, maybe nothing. All it means is that I'm going to keep an open mind when it comes to relationships, and may very well end up dating guys as well as girls. This is something that I've been thinking about for a long time, so it's not by any means something new or something that I'm rushing into. It's also NOT a case of doing this because I've started to fancy men, the truth is - I don't.. not yet anyway, but I'm not opposed to dating a guy, and indeed, it is something that I would like to experience.  I don't quite know my next step from here, I'm just going to take it one day at a time and see what happens...  PS, thank you very much to each and everyone of my friends that I've told about my sexuality, that have been fine with it.. I'm still the same guy that I ever was, and I'm glad that you recognise this.. I've not yet told my parents.. not because I'm worried about their reaction (I know they will be cool with it), but just because it's none of their business&#8230; although they could easily find out just by realising this blog, so lets see what happens.

       I just wanted to post a quick message saying sorry for all the boring blogs I've been posting... all these posts about our crap internet connection, computer game law suits, and other technical and boring crap.  I know it's not much fun for you guys to read, but as well as an online journal, my blog is my ranting zone, and seeing as our internet connection (among other things mentioned above) is causing me hassle at the moment, it's more than a valid topic to be ranted about.  I promise to get back to more juicy posts soon, things like my latest homosexual adventures (or rather lack of them, as the case has sadly been), as well as other gossip. So please don't give up on me, and you'll get your fill of the more exciting soon enough.  Thank you.

       Well, this has not actually solved any our current NTL internet problems, but after our internet connection dropping again earlier today, I've phoned NTL to report it, and for the first time, they have admitted that our router could not have been at fault.  They've given us permission to set-up our network again (seeing that their 'experiment' had failed), and are currently 'monitoring' our connection (whatever that means).  Problem is, it's too little too late... we've started looking into ADSL alternatives. Anyone know anything about the ISP  urlLink Bulldog ?  PS, before I was able to post this message, our connection died again. The forth time in the past 2 days. We've since phoned NTL again, who now think it's something to do with our cable modem, so they are sending someone out to replace it. Lets hope this is the last of our problems.

       For anyone that's interested, I was meant to be going camping in Dover this weekend. But due to one of my friends making other plans at the last moment, I'm no longer going. It's a real shame, I was very much looking forward to going, but I guess I'll have to try and arrange it for another time.  In it's place, I've used some of my camping budget (or £40) to get a takeaway pizza (mmmmmmmmmmm), and will no doubt spend the rest when I go to Rochester on Monday. If you're good, I'll buy you something nice. :)

       To try and cut a long story short, NTL cable broadband is the worst connection to the internet I've ever had, my old dial-up modem used to be more reliable. With NTL cable broadband, you have no idea what your internet connection status will be from one moment to the next. We've had a problem with NTL for around two months now: our connection to the internet would drop out for no apparent reason many times a day, and despite many phone calls to NTL tech support, we're no closer to a solution.  The problem, when is occurs, is easy enough to fix: you just reset the modem by pulling the plug out for a few seconds, but seeing that the connection can drop anything up to 5 or 6 times a day, this can be frustrating, especially for someone who relies on the internet for work, such as me. The reason I'm posting about this now is because the latest event in the saga is just laughable.  We have four different computers in this house, three of which all need internet access. Due to this, we have the very good 'Netgear RP114 Router' to control each machines connection to the internet. For the past year and a half that we've had broadband from NTL (maybe longer, I've lost count), we've used this router, and it has worked fine every day since we got it. NTL know that we use a router, and so are trying to blame it for the crappy service we've been getting (in other words, they don't know what the problem is, and so are looking for a scapegoat – having worked in tech support myself, I know this trick well).  In an effort to try prove that our problems are related to the router, the NTL tech guy told me to leave the router out of the loop, and have my laptop connected directly to the modem, rather than via the router, and to leave it like that for the next three days. This was intended to show that the connection would be stable without the router, and that we would not have anymore faults.  This is the funny bit: within four hours of receiving this advice, the connection dropped.  With my head held high, I phoned them back and explain what had happened. I was ready for them to admit defeat, to admit that it's not possibly the router's fault, and ready for them start looking for the real cause of the problem, only to be told that the one disconnection we had today was not enough evidence that anything was wrong, and that we should just try and ignore it (just like they seemed to ignore the fact we've had this very same problem for the past 2 months).  As it stands at the moment, I don't quite know what's going on. The tech guy said that he would raise a fault ticket, and that someone would phone us back on Monday. As for the disruptive internet connection we're going to have over the weekend: we should just put up with it (Who taught these guys customer support skills? Saddam Hussein?)  At least one thing good is going to come out of this: my mum has asked me to look into ADSL providers to find a suitable alternative. So with some luck, soon I'll be able to say goodbye to NTL cable broadband, and hello to ADSL. If anyone out there can recommend a good ADSL provider, please let me know.  (So much for cutting a long story short eh? :))

       By now most of you should have heard of the sad case of 14 year old Stefan Pakeerah, who was stabbed to death by his friend, 17 year old friend Warren Leblanc. May poor Stefan Pakeerah rest in peace, and Warren Leblanc get what's coming to him.  This post is not about that case directly however, but rather it's supposed cause - video games. It has been claimed that this death was as a direct result of the game 'Manhunt' by Rockstar Games (creators of the fantastic 'Grand Theft Auto' series, another game that has been in the spotlight), because it "caused violence".  I'm sorry, but this is pathetic.   For a start, the game was rated 18 by the BBFC. No one under this age should have been playing in the first place. It's marketing is clearly aimed towards over 18 year olds, with the 18 badge clearly shown on all adverts and copies of the game. It's also illegal for shops to sell it to anyone under the age of 18. So how did this teenager get hold of this game?  More so than this, there is no evidence to prove that video games can in anyway cause violence. If anything, I would suggest they have the opposite effect: On many occasions I've been upset or annoyed at something, and have played video games to help calm me down. They were a good way for me to vent my frustration, and often allow for escapism (which can be a good thing).   Now I'm happy to admit that this video game could have given this teenager some inspiration in the way in which he killed his friend. Much in the same way as I was recently inspired by the film 'I, Robot' to start reading some of Isaac Asimov's robot stories (remember, films have been blamed for the same thing in the past, nothing came of it). And how the soon to be released game World of WarCraft is inspiring me to create comics set within the WarCraft universe. (surely both positive/creative things?) But the idea of killing must have been in his head to start with, otherwise why would he be looking for inspiration?  The problem here is not with video games. The problem is with a very sick teenager who obviously needs some help. You can't blame video games for this boys actions - you need to blame the boy himself, and the parents of the boy.  Who gave him a copy of the game? The parents no doubt. Who obviously did not condition him to living in the modern world, and teach him the difference between right and wrong? The parents! Who obviously have not been paying enough attention to him, for him to have to use an act such as killing another person, as a cry for help? The parents!  I do truly feel sorry for Mr & Mrs Pakeerah, and can totally understand that they should try and seek justice. But for them to try and place the blame on the game, and the games creators is wrong. They need to look at Warren Leblanc and his parents to answer for his actions. Not an innocent video game.

       I'm currently typing this message into blog using my laptop, but publishing it via my old desktop. That can mean only one thing: my desktop repair/upgrade was a success!  After receiving all the components on Friday, I quickly went to work, using my kitchen table as a workbench to put it all together. Apart from a hic-up with the processor speed, which was being shown by XP to be a 1800+ rather than a 2400+ (which was easily fixed by increasing the FSB speed in the bios - thank you Savastore tech support), the operation was a complete success, in fact it went a lot better than I expected it to. From now on, my desktop will be referred to as 'the server'.  Using some fantastic software called  urlLink Ultr@VNC  means I can access the server's windows desktop remotely from my laptop (like I'm doing to publish this blog), meaning I don't need to have a monitor plugged in to use it (thank you for the suggestion Rob). It's role will be to take over some of the more menial jobs my laptop used to do, things like run my web server software, store my MP3s and other media files (which I can play via the network), manage downloads and back-up important files if I plan on taking my laptop out with me (hardware can be replaced, data can't).  It also means that my very cool  urlLink web cam  is back online, so be sure to check it out.

       Although I officially finished working on the Rail Gourmet project on Friday, I've spent the last few days adding some finishing touches to the site to make it perfect. After many hours work, I have finally shipped all the files back to the company for testing (which should go nice and smooth, not accounting for human error on the behalf of the testers), and if I'm lucky, it's the last I will ever see of it.  Which is great because I already have a follow up project in the works.  Now before you go getting all excited, this is one of my own ideas, so I won't be making any money from it, not directly anyway (once it's complete, I might be able to make some money via banner ads or sponsorship – but I'm not holding my breath). I'm not doing it for the money however, I'm doing it to advance my skills, and to have a site in my portfolio I can be proud of (I've developed many sites in the past, but currently have almost nothing to show for it – that needs to change).  I'm not going to tell you what the project is just yet though (ner ner ner ner ner). It's an idea that I've been playing around with for a couple of years now, and have tried to get it off the ground on a number of occasions in the past, but have failed each time (mainly due to hitting a technical block I could not overcome). This time however, I have faith I can complete it: my knowledge of PHP is the best it's ever been, and I've got nothing better to do until World of WarCraft is released – but to stay on the safe side, just in case something goes wrong, I'm keeping it very close to my chest.  I will tell you this much however, if you enjoy reading or writing stories, then this site will be for you.

       Who says that money can't buy happiness? I've just placed an order for the  urlLink AMD Athlon XP2400 / 256Mb DDR / Motherboard Upgrade Kit , which I'm going to use to fix my old desktop. Seeing as I already have a perfectly good tower case, graphics card, network card and CD/CDRW drive, this kit contains everything else I need to get me up and running, a processor, heat sink & fan, motherboard, and RAM. The motherboard has onboard sound, and seeing as I'm only going to be using it as a server, I might sell my old sound card (Sound Blaster Live Platinum) on eBay.  Once I get it working (*fingers crossed*) I plan on using the desktop as a network server. I'm going to run Apache, PHP and mySQL for my web development needs, an FTP server for my friends (but seeing as I've only got 128 Kbit upstream, it's not going to be amazingly good), and maybe host the odd game server or two. The great thing about is will be the ability for me to remove some of the junk I've got on the laptop (such as listed above) onto the desktop, leaving the laptop free and easy, and running smooth.  Once I get the parts, and start trying to put it together, I'll let you know.

       It was a bit touch and go at the end, and I had my fair share of frantic last minute problems, but I'm happy to announce that I've finished the Rail Gourmet project - on time! I've got to go and visit them Monday afternoon to explain how it works, and then fight with them for the next 4 weeks about my payment (they are very good at being slow to pay), but I can now relax and enjoy my weekend.  Drinks are on me (once I've been paid).

       I hate it when this happens, I'm so bad at falling asleep.  As you should all know, I've got a very important project due in a few days time. Rather than repeating what I have been doing so far, i.e. working late into the night, I thought to myself "If I get some early nights this week, I can wake up early, and get the project cracked out nice and quick". Great in theory, but my body clock is working against my plan.  I managed to get to bed at a record time of 11:30pm on Sunday night, waking up initially at around 5:30am on Monday morning, but then waking again at 10:30am after falling back to sleep. This is no major victory however, seeing as it was mainly due to the fact I had been awake since 3:00pm Saturday (give or take a few hours kip on Sunday afternoon). I was hoping that an 'early to bed' last night, with an 'early to rise' today would help prompt an 'early to bed' tonight as well, but alas no. I was going to try and get to sleep at around 12:00 midnight, but got chatting with someone, so didn't actually go to bed until around 2:00am, but alas it's now close to two hours later, and I just can't drop off.  I guess it's my own fault to an extent, but only because I have a real problem sleeping. I.e. the real problem is that I find it hard to drop off anyway, and feel that I'm wasting my time by being in bed, but not sleeping. So I make it worse by staying up until I'm practically falling asleep in my chair, then going to bed. I've been doing that for a number of weeks now - heck, a number of months even, going to sleep at any time between 4:00am and 6:00am - sometimes not even going to bed until the following lunchtime (trying to pull an all-nighter, but not quite succeeding). I doubt this is doing my body any good, especially seeing as I'm not getting up until around 2:00pm on average - I'm missing so much of the day.  I don't know what to do about it, I guess I could seek some professional help, but I honestly don't know what they will be able to do to help. I have tried taking herbal sleeping pills, and they do tend to work in the short term, but I don't want to have to keep using them as I've no idea what damage they might be dong to my body. I guess something like being hypnotised could help, and I have to admit that being hypnotised is on my list of things I'd like to do, but I'm not sure I can afford it (especially if I can't get this project complete on time).  Anyway, I guess tonight I'm going to surf the web a bit, and then try going to bed again at around 4:00 - 4:30am. Wish me luck :)

       For any of you that know me well, you will know that for the past few (I say few, must be close to a year by now) months I've been waiting to get some freelance web development work that has been promised from my dad's company. This has become known as 'The Rail Gourmet Project', and is worth a lot of money to me.  Well, I've had it now for about a month now, and have been working hard on it, but have only just recently made a breakthrough, and I can finally see that the end is in sight – that I can complete it, which is important because I've only got until Friday to finish and ship it back to them.  The problem is not the coding itself. It's true I have not done anything quite like this before (adding a security system to a site), but you only learn by doing, and I'm a quick learner, so this is fantastic experience for me. The problem is the fact I'm continuing on from a developer who is VERY new to coding, and as such has not written the best code.  I'm trying to do two things at once: learn how to do new things in a professional way, while learning how to decode what someone has written in an unprofessional way. Not an easy task. I find it hard enough to read code from people that know what they are doing, so this is a nightmare.  In all fairness to the guy, he's very good considering the little time he has been coding for, and I'm sure that one day he could make a fine developer, but it's still not quite good enough for large project like this, He's making silly little mistakes, mistakes which I'm having to tidy up. I just hope that I'm able to decode what he's done well enough to make good on my end of the deal.  So, wish me luck, if I manage to do this on time (which has to happen, or I'm dead), drinks are on me.

       I'm a regular on the  urlLink battle.net World of WarCraft forums . I visit at least once a day and spend time reading up on the latest news and ideas for the game, as well as posting my own opinions and ideas, etc..  Now some idiot has taken it upon himself to  urlLink pretend to be me , and has started posting bullshit messages about making money from lag.  How is this possible? Anyone that uses battle.net knows that it hosts a number of different gateway, each placed in different locations around the world, each one allowing you to sign-up for an account. Because each of these gateways are separate, you are able to sign-up using the same username as someone else using a different gateway. Whoever is it has even copied my forum signature in an attempt to make it look authentic.  I (The original Xepheus) am using the Northrend gateway while this new impostor is using the Azeroth one (I used to use the Europe gateway, but had to change a couple of weeks ago). You should easily be able to tell the difference between us based on the listed gateway next to the posters username, and by searching for a posters previous posts (i.e. I've got more of them), but I'm worried that someone might mistake this idiot as me, which may lead to problems with our guild.  I've reported this poster, all I can hope is that Blizzard do something about it. Otherwise, I'm just going to ignore whoever it is. No point in getting upset about idiots like that after all.

       After close to two months of sloppy service, abuse & neglect, and an internet connection more unstable than a bull in a china shop, my mum has finally become so pissed off with NTL, she's given them the old heave-ho! (Or, in plain English, we've cancelled our NTL broadband internet connection).  We're sticking to NTL for our cable television and second telephone line (which we don't use very much, but with free line rental who's complaining?), but the broadband just has to go. (take a look at some of my past blog entries to see just how bad our connection was).  As a parting gift from the only decent NTL customer support employee we've had the luck to deal with, we've been awarded a years worth of compensation as their way of saying sorry. I don't know how much it's all worth in total, but part of the compensation includes £10 a month off the price of our cable television for the next year, plus no charge for our two additional television set-top boxes for the next three months (so at a rough guess, it's at least £150 over the coming year).  As I'm typing this, my mother is upstairs ordering a  urlLink 1 MB line from Bulldog .  With £1 connection, and unlimited download bandwidth each month for only £30 a month (£20 for the first three months), you can't go wrong (it's the cheapest I've found so far, and I've heard good things about Bulldog, so lets hope it does not turn out to be another red herring).  We've had to buy a new ADSL modem/router from Bulldog (we could have purchased our own, but it was cheaper and easier to buy from them), and seeing as we're going to be paying a lot less for NTL over the next 12 months, it's almost like NTL are paying it for us. The other benefit of buying hardware off the ISP is that they have to support it, so no longer can we be fobbed off with the excuse that we're "behind a network" as the network would have been supplied by them.   Anyway, as long as all goes well, we'll be connected within the next 10 to 12 days.

       I've decided to leave the 'Gay_Pagans_UK' Yahoo group that I was a member of. I've got nothing against the other members (oh the whole, the ones I spoke with were very nice people), but I feel that being a member of this group was making someone that I was not, someone I didn't like.  Read on and I'll do my best to explain.  I've got my own faith. The truth is, I don't feel it's even a 'faith', or even a 'belief', it's more of an 'idea'. It's my own personal view of how the world works, how it all fits together, and what my role in the world is. It is also basis for my own morals – and how I judge what I feel is right and wrong. I'm not however 'religious'. I never have been, and I hope that I never will be.  My own view on religion is that it's the only true source of evil in the world.  I've got no problem with faith. I'm happy for someone to have as much faith as they want, and to believe in whatever they want: in God, in Jesus, in Mother Earth, in Buddha, in whoever or whatever, believe what you want. That's 'faith' and in some cases can be good or you (some people draw power from their faith), that's not 'religion'.  Religion, for example, is where one culture decides that their faith is more important than someone else's, and as such seeks to convert people for their own needs. To "Convert the sinners" for example. It's where Christians might say that Hinduism is wrong because "there is only one god". Or for Islam to say that Paganism is wrong because of the freedom of sexuality that's allowed within pagan circles.  Religion is also people taking advantage of power that religion has given them (or who have even manipulated religion for their own purposes and to gain power), people like vicars and priests (for example) who abuse children or steal money (saying it's for god – yeah, right).  What is the number one cause of war, death and destruction in the world? Religion!  When religion raises it's ugly head, it causes nothing but trouble.  That is why I don't like religion (I hope that you understand what I mean, and see the difference between religion and faith?)  What does this have to do with the pagan group?  Well, once again, 'religion' has something to do with it. Each of the members, in their own little way, was religious. On a couple of occasions I heard at least one of them mummer some anti-Christian words (which I will admit were justified, but in this day and age of forgiveness, were out of place, and not needed), and even had one occasion where one of the members was forcible trying to push his own views upon me. Something which I myself find very immoral.  Anyway, since becoming a member of the group, I've found myself turning into someone that I'm not. I found that by joining the group, I was highlighting myself as being a 'pagan', and in turn, no longer being 'Daniel Hollands'. I found myself becoming (even if only a tiny bit) 'religious', and I really didn't like that. I found myself becoming very 'them' and 'us'... and that's just not who I am.  I'm more than happy to admit that this is my own fault, and is a result of my own thought process, and is not in anyway the fault of the other members, and if you're interested in meeting gay pagans, I can't think of a better group than 'Gay_Pagans_UK', but it was not my scene.  The reason I joined the group in the first place was because I was looking for more people like myself, and though that a joining a pagan group would be the best place to find other people like me (because of the pagan connection). It turns out that I was wrong.  What I really want, in a group of people like me, is a group that share my view that 'everyone is different, but equal'. I don't care from what background you come, or what your belief structure is based around (or even if you don't have one at all), as long as you're open minded to other people and their way of life.  That's what I'm looking for, with some luck, one day I might find it.  (PS, due to a close call, I've put my 'sexual exploration' on hold for the moment. Nothing bad actually happened to me (thankfully), but it was highly possible that something could have. All this means is that I'm still bi-curious, and I am still very keen on finding out what homosexual sex is like, it's just the timing is all wrong.)  (PPS, Although I gave two examples above of religions being used in bad ways, I just want to point out that I've not got a problem with any of the cultures mentioned above – or indeed any cultures in the world that I know anything about. I respect them all equally. Now I admit that I don't agree with some of their ideas and beliefs, but who am I to say they are wrong?)

       My good friend Caroline and I had a very nice trip to Rochester today. While it's not quite as good as the camping I would have liked to have done over the weekend, we had a good time regardless.  We spent a large proportion of our time browsing the shops in the local 'high street' - lots of smallish shops all set-up to catch the tourist trade (which we fit into more than happily on this occasion). I counted no less than three 'new age' shops, two 'used books' shops, and a whole host of other little shops that you would never even think of looking in, unless you were a tourist. Oh, and they had a 'tourist information centre', if that was not the icing on the cake, I don't know what is.  Two of the shops we went in sold swords, one of them had a fantastic 'for display purposes only' presentation sword. It would probably bend or break in two if anyone tried to use it (and the plastic handgrip was a bit of a turn off), but it came with a cool wooden wall mount, and all in all, just looked fantastic. When I get my own place, one of my first purchases is going to be a display sword for the wall.   After around an hour or so looking in the various other touristy shops, we decided to check out the Cathedral. I'd been there before, a few years ago with the school. I can't say I was highly impressed to be honest. It was majestic building, and I remember being quite impressed with it back when I visited it with the school.  But!  Since my discovery that I was a pagan at heart, I've not had a great thing for Christianity, or anything relating to it. Although if truth be told, I don't think I ever have. I respect Christianity, and respect the people who believe in it, it's just not me. I guess it's much like a dog lover being at a cat show, same idea, just different theme.  After dodging out a side entrance in an effort to avoid the people at the main entrance, who were collecting donations for the church, (who we didn't want to give money too, seeing as we both believe the church has had more than it's fair share of money over the years) we wandered over to the castle.  Such as with the Cathedral, I'd seen it before, so rather than go inside again (there was not much to see anyway, most of the inside had collapsed), we found a nice spot facing the river Medway, sat down, and chatted about 'this', 'that' and 'the other' until we got hungry.  A bit later, after finding some food (I have a wonderful jacket potato with a coronation chicken filling and salad), we found my mum (who had been kind enough to give us a lift down here, before going off to meet her friend), and after a bit more shopping (specifically in one of the two used book shops, and then in Matalan on the way home for some new XXL t-shirts – yeah I'm getting fat), we returned home and chilled out for the rest of the evening.  All in all, a very good day out.
