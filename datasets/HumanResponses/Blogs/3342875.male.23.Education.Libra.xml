       urlLink      Another picture from the "Last Chance Dance Dance" Party. The dude on the left has a broken ankle and was playing 7 and 8 foot heavies.  His words "If my leg wasn't messed up, I'd be getting AA's!!"  Sheesh!

      I recently purchased a gmail account from ebay, for $4.72.  My new email from here out (with 1GB, who needs anything else?) is joel.gibby@gmail.com.    Sweetness.

       urlLink    w00t!  The fellas pictured here were at my "end-of-the-school-year-dance-dance-revolution-party" Since school is over, the lost and found became a free for all, and these lucky punks happend to find something quite amazing.  Hidden amongst the coats, shoes, gym shorts and etc. was a working Atari 7800 console, and bag after ziploc &copy; bag of game cartridges, 47 in total.  Included in that total were three Star Wars &copy; games, just about every classic game you can think of (Asteroids, Donky Kong, Pitfall I and II, ...) and all in good, very good and working condition.  Hope they all can agree on who takes it home :)  Joel

      I posted a Bubble Tea search form that users can add to their website on  urlLink Bubble Tea Fans' Journal .  Hopefully it will be of use to users and in turn drive some more traffic my way .. :)

      (to the tune of Karma Chameleon)  I'm planning on adding a ratings feature to the  urlLink Bubble tea  webpage I've started (3 months ago).  Hopefully it will build more of a community, since the  urlLink bobafind forum  idea flopped like a shoe.  I think I have a total of 16 users and 12 posts. :...(  &lt;shameless plug&gt; If anyone is reading this ... go register and post on the  urlLink bubble tea forums  and I'll send you a personal email telling you how much I appreciate your contribution.  Like that would entice anyone.... &lt;/shameless plug&gt;  We'll see..

      After spending the weekend working on the Avaunt Heavy Equipment website, it feels like I'm running on fumes.  I seem to start new projects before I finsish the last ones, which ends up stressing me out a little bit.  Usually I can't say "no" if someone assigns more work to me, though I'm getting better. I'm realizing I'm not the only one who knows how to do something right, and sometimes you need to let go ;-)
