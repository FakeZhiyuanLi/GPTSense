Food was okay (mee, rice, fried chicken, red egg, sweet n sour fish, popia). Stayed with our own people. Richard, Kian Yung etc. all outside-drinking. We stayed inside, and chatted the whole 2 hours away. Various topics.. interesting ones. Went back around 10:15 pm.

      Didn't sleep well yesterday. But still had a great day today, a fun Saturday.  This morning, need to be at school by 8 am. Gotong-royong for my class. For our morale project, we need to take some pictures, of us cleaning the class. So it was kinda wierd, 'cause each time we're sweeping, or wiping, or just cleaning the class, we need to just STOP, to pose for pictures. After then continue with our chores again.. Haha.. so fake. But the class was really in a dreadful state, cleaning it was a benefit to all.  Later go Financial Park with Choon Wah, ask Hsei Di and Alvin to join us, too. Sigh, terrible place. Nowhere to loiter, most of the time hanging out at Blueberry. Kinda bored with that place. But no other choice. Labuan is really a small place, every teenager seems to be at Financial Park today. Everywhere we go, we're bound to me 1 or 2 people that we know.  Went to Layang-Layangan to eat satay and chicken wings with teacher Chou and Choon Wah. SO delicious.. ! ^_^ But i hate my tummy, eat little little bit also full already.. then awhile hungry back.. but by then, all the food also gone liao.. :( Go jogging in Botanical Garden, then go drink agian.. Hehe.. and after that, home.  First time get to do such thing, with my lau gong again.. So happy.. :P  At night, Alex's birthday party. Wasn't suppose to have beer, but some of his friends brought some. So stayed inside with Kian Boon, Gilda, Hsei Di, Kian Yung, Alvin Boy and Ah Seng. Think we're the only one that didn't drink beer.. And also play the 'game'. Were u need to kiss an opposite sex as 'punishment' if you lost. Went back at 10:15 pm.

       My first blog.  Wonder who will read my blog - Nobody, I guess. Suit me just fine.  Why I started blogging?  I need space. My own space, for me to speak my mind, to ponder on my confused life, and just to pour out my feelings and expressions, onto deaf ears. I've tried blogging once, but had been too busy to update it. It was long gone forgotten, until I saw jinn khing's blog. It suddenly changed the whole prespective of what blogging's for.  Reality, there's nobody I can turn to, when I'm facing problems.. Which one could not understand. They think they do, but they don't- I have no true friends, but at least i still have my true love. But sometimes, i feel that he, too, doesn't really understand what I'm trying to say. Thus, couldn't help me overcome my problems. I know he tries, but boys will be boys. Boys don't listen, they talk.. :( sigh..  On the other hand, it could be me. Maybe there's something wrong with me. Maybe I'm just a loner. My results are slipping. I need help, drastically. But i know the only person that can help me- is me. Wah tries his best to support me, motivates me to study, and he too, i hope, will do the same to study hard and get good results in his SPM. I really hope he does. It's his last year, and I think that he should give it all his best. Promises have been made between us and I hope each of us do our part by keeping it. He said, if i get good results this semester, he'll do anything i want! ^_^ Hm.. lemme see..  1) Bring me for a joyride 2) A massaging session    3) Send me roses 4) A wedding ring  HEHE..
