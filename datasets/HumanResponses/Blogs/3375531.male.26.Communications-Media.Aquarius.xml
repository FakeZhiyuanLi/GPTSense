       I just watched  Lilo & Stitch  for the 2nd time (weird since I live on Kauai, you'd think I would have seen it more than that) and I was struck by how easily the movie is funny and then emotional, and how well they did both.  But what really hit me was the sincerity in the voice acting for Stitch (when he starts speaking, of course).  Without a doubt the best line in the movie and the best delivered line are the same, Stitch describing his family:  It's little and broken, but still good.  Yes.  Still good.  As the proud owner of a Hawaiian hanai family myself, I can relate.  Mom died in '98, I don't talk to dad much or my brother.  My family here IS my family, even though we're not related and I've only known them a few years.  Psalm 68:6 says "God sets the lonely in families."  It's true.

       We had an  awesome  four hour session for worship leaders at the church with Mark Riley and some of his friends, a guitarist from Australia and a drummer from Ireland.  Great stuff.  We sang psalms, led and followed, prayed the Word, prayed with drums, and had a good time.  Then it was back to church for pastor's "surprise" birthday party.  He said he might have almost been surprised if people hadn't been asking him to go home earlier in the day and if there hadn't been a bunch of cars in front of the church when he came with his son to "pick something up."  Heh.  Good day overall, and now I'm tired.  Need to get up at 6:30 tomorrow.

         urlLink Right Wing News (Conservative News and Views) : Yesterday, the New York Times ran a puff piece on that murderous commie swine, Che Guevara. Just get a load of the opening to article...  'Che Guevara is widely remembered today as a revolutionary figure; to some a heroic, Christ-like martyr, to others the embodiment of a failed ideology. To still others, he is just a commercialized emblem on a T-shirt.'  '(T)o some a heroic, Christ-like martyr'? Che Guevara? Could they have at least added, 'but those people are either ignorant college kids who don't know any better or Noam Chomsky clones who can't go more than 5 minutes without talking about how much they hate America?'    Man, calling a mass-murdering communist thug "Christ-like" is now on the list of  Ways to Make Noah Mad .  As I  urlLink commented  on  RWN , the person who wrote that deserves to have really bad things happen to them.  Lucky for them (and me) it's not God's will for anyone to get what they deserve.  Those people need Jesus.  Fo' shua.

       Hmm.  It's difficult to live my life to please God.  Mostly because almost everything in me wants to live a very self-pleasing life.  And it's not like I actually have to give up anything I really want for my life, just that I have to give up my  stinkin thinkin , as Joyce Meyer puts it.  I guess this must be discipline and character I'm learning, doing what's right all the time even when I don't want to.  That makes it kinda cool, like being a spiritual samurai.  I still like samurai.   Off-Topic:   It appears I have an opportunity to work out my violent tendencies in Basketball instead of RTS war games.  Burns more calories, so I'm all for it.

       Well, I spent almost the entire day finishing out a proof-of-concept Flash site (this one's an image viewer for large image files), and kept getting one thing working and then something else wouldn't work.  Finally got the component itself working perfectly around 4:00 PM.  But then when I coupled it with a list so you could select different files to view, it stopped working right.  Spent another two hours at least narrowing the problem down.  The solution was two lines of code, resetting the horizontal and vertical scale attributes before loading a new pic.  Igh.  I'd been working on this stupid thing for over a week.  Longest single project ever for me.  Anyway, I got that working, but my free prohosting.com account won't work with video, audio, or filenames with spaces for that matter, so I can't actually show any of this off.  I am presently frustrated.  I might be able to squeeze the new stuff onto my ISP's free hosting, but their FTP server is down.  Again.  So I can't upload it, or even see how much storage I have left.  On top of this, the phone bill is due, the bank account is -$84, and I have $75 CoH and no prospect of income this week.  I was really praying a miracle would come through and I'd get a website contract this week, but now I can't show anything to the two potential clients I have right now... Sigh.  Must remember God is in charge.  If anyone is actually reading this stuff, you can see the proof-of-concept sites  urlLink here  (minus the photo viewer, since I can't update the site right now) and let me know what you think in the comments.

        Decision:   In the event John F. Kerry is elected president, I will actually support Hawaiian Soverignty.  Not because I buy into the "Hawaii was unjustly conquered and the U.N. Charter demands the return of lands to their indiginous people" stuff (not denying the conquest thing, though), but because I think living in small family communities in fertile river valleys with no electricity, fighting off attacks from Russian and Japanese invaders (drawing from history, here) with rocks and spears (us, the invaders would still have guns, of course, since they'd still belong to a civilized country) would actually be preferable to living in a Kerry-run America.  Not to mention our survivability would be higher.   Observation:   The west side of Kauai isn't a bad place to visit to work on a friend's house, and probably isn't even a bad place to live.  It's alot like Duncanville and south Garland, only without the gang shootings and drive-bys.

       Well, today I got to speak to a friend I left back in Texas when I moved to Hawaii.  She's a liberal.  I used to be.  Now I'm so conservative it would be a complete lie to claim I'm not partisan.  But, anyway, moving on.  I said I hate dumb liberals.  She said "I'm a liberal."  I said "True, but you're not dumb."  Then it turned out we both hate dumb liberals.  I think it's because we both hate dumb people.  I can respect an intelligent person with points of view so radically different from my own they could start wars.  I can respect and even  like  that person, and  agree to disagree .  When I get fed up is when an  unintelligent, uninformed liberal conspiracy-spouter  goes on and on about total crap.   Three things I can't stand: lies, crap, and manipulation.   Stupid liberals affect varying levels of all three.  Also of note is that she supports Bush for reelection.  More of note is why:  Although she disagrees with many of his policies, she believes he has the proven leadership to take us forward in these difficult times.  Bush is the man to handle the War on Terror.  Bush is the man who has proved he can handle issues here at home.  Now is not the time to bring in an unknown and try to "start over from scratch."

        Title 18, Part I, Chapter 115, Section 2381 of the United States Legal Code defines 'treason' in the following way: "Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason."   That's scary.  By legal definition, it seems many congressmen and much of the American media is guilty of treason.  But they do it arguing the enemies they help are the good guys.  Like Senator Kerry did with VVAW.  Where is the line on this?  When does free speech go to far and become treason?

         urlLink Yahoo! News - U.S. Soldier to Face Judgment on Iraq Prisoner Abuse : "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S. military policeman Specialist Jeremy Sivits faces a court martial on Wednesday on charges of abusing Iraqi prisoners"    Good.   One of the things we  must  do is show the world that we don't stand for this kind of behavior.  All those responsible should be punished to the full extent of military code applicable to their crimes.  Those who think the people in the highest level of authority should be punished have no understanding of chain of command, and are apparently participating in more  senseless election-year political engineering .

         urlLink Who Is Abu Zarqawi? : "Zarqawi has been associated with other groups besides Tawhid. Most notorious is Ansar al Islam, a largely Kurdish organization operating out of Northern Iraq, which U.S. officials have linked to al Qaeda. Before the war, Ansar al Islam ran chemical warfare camps in northern Iraq. Last year British counterterrorist investigators traced poisonous ricin found in Manchester to those camps."   Confirmed sarin and mustard gas attacks on US troops in Iraq, and now ricin confirmed as coming out of Iraq... how long will the media keep saying there isn't any WMD in Iraq?

       Okay, over the past few days I've been contemplating this fantasy world some liberals (especially here in Hawaii) seem to live in.  It's a place where the President knew in detail exactly what would happen on 9/11 and was too scared to stop it, a place where John Kerry is a strong leader, or for that matter, has any leadership qualities at all, and a place where Al Qaeda is a band of idealist revolutionaries fighting off American and Zionist imperialist oppression of the world.  Man, we even oppress places we've never heard of!  It's also a place where the only way to get rich is to exploit people, and therefore all rich people are evil and have no right to keep that money they made (funny... they still support Kerry...).  Anyway, I think I've narrowed down one of the thought process differences with this ficticious example:    A man commits a series of brutal murders, totaling 32 dead.     Liberal viewpoint:    Oh!  The poor man!  He didn't get a Gameboy Advance SP as a child, he didn't go to the "good school," he didn't fit in with the whites/blacks/Hispanics/Chinese/whatever ethnic/racial group was dominant where he grew up, he was mistreated by the establishment, and his neighbor/teacher/employer was rash and bigoted.  We can't hold him responsible for his actions, in the light of all the hardships he's endured.  We must respond by setting him free and instituting new, costly government programs to ensure all children have access to Gameboy Advance SPs, good schools, and tolerant people, and we must renounce the establishment that mistreated him and accuse it of more mistreating, since the only real way to solve the problem is to properly place blame.    Conservative viewpoint:    The deaths of 32 people must not go un-avenged.  We recognize that this man didn't get a Gameboy Advance SP as a child, didn't go to the "good school," didn't fit in with the whites/blacks/Hispanics/Chinese/whatever ethnic/racial group was dominant where he grew up, was mistreated by the establishment, and his neighbor/teacher/employer was rash and bigoted.  We will see to it that he has access to therapy so he can sort out these issues in prison, where he will spend the rest of his life until he dies of natural causes or is executed, depending on the policy of the state in which he committed these horrible crimes.  We must respond by holding him accountable for his actions in spite of whatever circumstances led him to his tragic choice, because we understand that if we do not, it spells the beginning of the end of civilization, law, and order.  We must review the circumstances that contributed to his state and determine how best to influence them for the better, since the only real way to solve the problem is to stick to and enforce our standards, morals, and values.   Just something I've been seeing lately.

       Read something on  urlLink RightWingNews  today about what was considered torture in Iraq under Saddam.  I will  not  repeat it here.  Some Iraqis were quoted as saying they think our "prison scandal" is positively comical in comparison.  I mean, I really, really can't understand how ANYONE could get to the place where they would organize and do something like  that .  I was a pretty sadistic evil wannabe murder before I got saved, and even then I would have stopped miles short of this, even on my worst enemy.  I guess when moral standards are absent or swept under the rug, humans get an opportunity to see just how much evil they can let out.  And invent.   There but for the grace of God go we.   And every day America inches a little closer.  It's time we go back to what we were founded on.

       Wow.  8 days no post.  Course, I've been gone since Wednesday morning at our youth camp.  Turns out the reason I didn't get my way at youth the other week was because our guest speaker at the camp ended up talking alot about the same subject.  Now I think they're ready to really jump into this one.  Learned a bunch of new games and got to know a bunch of people in the youth group better.  Good camp.  I'm fasting from news right now, and although I don't have as much to complain about (hehe) I've noticed I'm mad alot less!  I'm still just as opinionated.  On a side note, another thing I've learned is if you're playing Taboo with teenagers and you have two people playing with quasi-Shakespearian vocabularies, it's not fair for them to be on the same team!  We didn't realize that until we noticed we were always getting each other's clues and the kids were all going "huh?"  We kept using synonyms of the taboo words.

       Well, I'm not sure what happened with the youth group today.  Not what  I  had planned, that's for sure.  Just have to trust God that He's working out what He wants done.  On the other side of the coin, I have a domain now!   urlLink www.cskauai.com  is my site.  What's up now is my Flash demos page, and the main site is in development as we speak.  Hopefully this and the couple referals I got this week will help jump start this business finally!  Gotta trust God on that one, too.

       I mentioned that my DSL service is currently off and I'm using an AOL trial right now to get online? Well, one of the articles on the front page seemed interesting, something about this 18-year old woman who stole $5 worth of gas and her punishment was to stand in front of the gas station for three hours wearing a sign that said she had to do that because she was convicted of stealing gas... Anyway, I thought I'd make a post on it there. I ended up reading the titles of other people's posts....  OVER 100 POSTS, 50% WERE RACIST (she's black) AND 40% WERE "BLAME BUSH"  LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So, naturally, I  had  to post. I   wish   I could link to it. I posted my own topic and commented on one. I shouldn't have to explain to, well, anyone with an IQ over 40 why saying this is Bush's fault is completely idiotic. If anyone disagrees,  PLEASE comment! Please!  Oh, I would love to debate that! LOL!    UPDATE:   I sent AOL some feedback on their message boards... has to be the WORST system I've ever seen. The stuff we used on BBSs in the 80s was vastly superior. Also, they don't do much to enforce the TOS, I'd say half the posts were violently racist, actually threatening damage to property and/or life and limb, using extremely foul language, or advocating assassinating the president...

       Well, the deadline came and went and the money never materialized, so I have - officially - until the 24 th  to get out. They could change their minds, or God could have some other place for me to live. Not sure yet. The funny thing is, I felt relieved when 5:00 PM came around and the money wasn't there. Seems strange, but the certainty of eviction is easier to handle than the uncertainty of it. Now I'm free to keep working on my site and concepts, keep promoting the business, keep looking for a part time job, and most importantly,  keep living . The last three days all I've been able to think about was the impossibility of getting the money on my own. Now I'm free from that, if a little scared about the future. But overall, I'm feeling better now than I was at 4:30.

       Well, it's been one day with two to go for me to collect a chunk of cash to "redeem my tenantcy" (not sure how you spell that word, and at 3:16am I'm not going to look it up). Made $90 today. That's interesting, I was expecting to make $0. Pastor said to believe God for a miracle. I'm trying.   On a side note, my meeting with the business partner and Small Business Development is tomorrow afternoon. One of the reasons I'm still up is I can't sleep. LOL. The other is I'm been working on pictures, listening to the Pumpkins, and looking up tabs. Turns out two of my favorite songs by them are really easy to play.   On another side note, more ideas for how to use the web to change how churches do business keep popping into my head. I won't be satisfied until I lead a revolution on how churches and nonprofits think about web sites. There is just so much useful stuff you can do cheap. That, and I strongly believe the site design should reflect the personality of the organization. And for some reason I keep saying I'm not an artist... Maybe I just mean I can't draw.   On a   third   side note, has the entire Democratic Party gone insane? When did they slip from normal Americans with some occasional disgustingly liberal viewpoints into hate-America madness? You want KERRY for PRESIDENT?!?!? The only question he's given a straight answer on in the last year is whether or not he served in Vietnam! He links to democraticunderground.com on his site, which includes yoyos who cheer Americans being murdered abroad. He's been absent from 80% of his votes in the Senate this term, and 50% the previous term. He doesn't even do the job he has now, and you want to make him president? He's admittedly in support of infanticide. He said he believes life begins at conception but he's pro choice. You can't have it both ways. If life begins at birth, then abortion kills a living person. He better stop claiming to be a Christian or he will likely get in alot of trouble with God. Maybe he's the antichrist. No, he's not charismatic enough.     Here's a little democratic observation:   In 2002 I was helping the Republican candidate for mayor of Kaua'i campaign (he won, thankfully) and do you know what the single most common objection of Democrats was? I mean like 90% of them saying the same thing? "WHERE'S THE MONEY?" The same people who elect people who make this the most REGULATED FREAKING STATE where the government taxes us for everything to fund programs that help almost no one thinks their hard earned cash will disappear if a Republican gets in office? They kind of have it backwards. I remember Lileks' story I linked to awhile back about the liberal college girl pushing for Kerry who told him that he didn't do anything to deserve his tax return and that should have been the government's money (actually, that all his money should be the government's). I also remember a post to... I think it was rightwingnews.com where a liberal said "I cannot support anyone who perpetuates the belief that the rich are entitled to their money." So, how do these two Democrat mindsets reconcile with the "where's the money" opposition to the Republican party? I don't get it.

UPDATE: &nbsp;  Actually, I'm totally freaking out and panicing about this and if I didn't have God in my life I'd probably have a heart attack or something.&nbsp; I do not want to lose the place to live I have and the benefits I have with it.&nbsp; I am 40 feet from my church where I live, and I wouldn't want to give that up.&nbsp; This scares me.&nbsp; I need God to tell me what the deal is, and soon.

         &nbsp; urlLink Yahoo! News - Ex-G.I. Jenkins Asks to See U.S. Military Lawyer : "A former U.S. Army sergeant accused of deserting to North Korea (news - web sites) and now in Japan receiving medical treatment has asked to speak to a U.S. military lawyer, a spokesman for the U.S. military forces in Japan said on Monday."    Well, this makes for an interesting problem.&nbsp; On the one hand, he's old, and we don't like to put old people through stuff like court martials.&nbsp; On the other, it looks like this guy defected, joined the reds, and probably worked against the US, and maybe was even indirectly responsible for US losses because of his propoganda work.&nbsp; Man.   So, obviously, the left wing will soon be up in arms about this if he is court martialed.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because they don't - in truth&nbsp;- believe anything is wrong with Communism and supporting it.&nbsp; Don't believe me?&nbsp; Look at their nomination for president!   The right, on the other hand, will likely see this as serious, which it is.&nbsp; If he did defect, and I'm not sure I buy the "kidnapped and brainwashed" story, he should be punished appropriately.&nbsp; Especially now.&nbsp; We need to remind people that in the United States of America, aiding our enemies is still treason.&nbsp; I'm not saying he should be executed, but we can't excuse treason.   This seems unrelated but it's not:&nbsp; How far we've come from what this country was founded on is sickening to me.&nbsp; John Kerry, someone who provided aid to our enemies, is running for president.&nbsp; Then other democrats accuse Bush of treason (then deny they said that, of course).&nbsp; I think the problem with the left basically comes down to one thing.&nbsp; We - the right, and every sane person in the world - know that the enemy is anyone who wants to cause us harm without good cause.&nbsp; The left believes WE are the enemy.&nbsp; Responsibility to our country vs. a strange sense of responsibility to everyone else and damn America.&nbsp; A republic - a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, vs. the nice socialist oligarcy the dems are pushing us towards.   Look at Hawaii.&nbsp; We have state-funded medical insurance, but no one can get it.&nbsp; We have, quite literally, more laws protecting criminals than victims.&nbsp; When I lived in Texas, I drew some comfort from the fact that (at the time) if I ever had to shoot an intruder, I was shooting someone in the commission of a fealony and defending myself and my property.&nbsp; In Hawaii, breaking and entering is a misdemeanor, and if I shot a wild-eyed druggy who charged me with his baseball bat after swinging it around smashing things, I would be guilty of murder.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp; In rape prevention classes they teach if you end up killing your assailant put a knife in his hand.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Because in Hawaii rape isn't serious enough to use deadly force to defend yourself.&nbsp; I can't carry a handgun.&nbsp; That still blows my mind.&nbsp; This state is messed up.   Two great quotes about gun control:         If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.    An armed individual is a citizen.&nbsp; An unarmed individual is a subject.

        urlLink Right Wing News (Conservative News and Views) :  In any case, our problems with Europe are not going away anytime soon unless we neuter ourselves and become 'Canada South'. Undoubtedly, that idea would appeal to many people Europeans and liberal Americans who are tired of American 'cowboys' dispensing frontier justice...until something happened. When there's a global 'OK Corral,' somebody better be able to show up wielding six guns, not waving around a copy of 'Robert's Rules of Order'. Without the US, there's no one left capable of playing that role. I've said before that force is the fundamental backbone of law, justice, and borders.&nbsp; Without force, or the ability to use force, you cannot  en force any policy or standard.&nbsp; I know the idealist utopian mentality that would have us put down our weapons and live in a world based on rules alone.&nbsp; But eventually, someone will decide whatever it is they believe in is worth fighting for.&nbsp; When that cause is Communism, genocide, or conquest, someone must be prepared to respond with force in equal or exceeding measure.&nbsp; "Speak softly and carry a big stick" is still good governmental advice.&nbsp; Lay down the rules and expectations, then be prepared to enforce them.

       From a comment from the post  urlLink "Astute observations from my favorite lunatic proponent of the right..." :   urlLink "This is a very passionate issue for me, so take what I'm about to say for whatever you think its worth."   Read the whole thing.  I think these points are for the most part very good.  My original post had oversimplified the issues a bit, and the root of the Israel/Arab issue is Isaac and Ishmael.  We pray for the peace of Jerusalem, but there won't be a real peace there until the Millennial Reign of Christ.  My views on the World Court hold.  As far as I know we're not represented in it, the country shouldn't enter in without a vote, and I don't think we should have anything to do with it in the first place.  This country was founded to get away from being ruled by a distant, foreign power where we're not represented.  I don't see how having anything to do with a world court or anything else that doesn't treat us as a sovereign nation does anything but advance the one world government agenda of the Antichrist.  Not sure he's been born yet, but it definitely looks like we're in the groundwork stages of his world dominion already.

        urlLink Rush Limbaugh on Compensation of 9/11 Victims vs. Military Families - Netlore Archive :  I think the vast differences in compensation between the victims of the September 11th casualty and those who die serving the country in uniform are profound. No one is really talking about it either because you just don't criticize anything having to do with September 11th. Well, I just can't let the numbers pass by because it says something really disturbing about the entitlement mentality of this country.  Read the whole thing.  It's screwed up.  If I had lost a family member in there, I'd be pissed, but not at my own country, and I sure as heck wouldn't expect anyone to pay me for it.  If someone gets mauled by a bear in a national park, should the government pay their family?  Life is inherently risky, and often ends suddenly.  This is cruel reality, and the government should not be expected to compensate people for a fact of life.

         urlLink IMAO : "The Israeli wall, which has stopped 90% of suicide bombings, has been  urlLink declared illegal by the Hague . This raises the important question: What's 'F**k you!' in Hebrew?"   Language:  don't totally agree, but understand.  Sentiment:  completely agree.  I still have this question:  Who the heck gave them the right to just go set up a court to try other countries?  Don't they understand national boundaries, sovereignty, and big, big nukes?  As far as I'm concerned, not the would court, the UN,  or anyone else  can force any judgment or anything else on a sovereign nation.  Only if we a agree to it.  And if it comes to a vote I sure as spit don't agree with subjecting ourselves to any foreign control, especially not a super-liberal European world court, which sounds to me like it's only purpose is to complain more about America and try to force us to be European anyway.  Okay.  Breathing.  Rant over.  If I had ninja assassins (well, fully trained ones, anyway) you can bet I'd deal with these "world court" problems.   Let America be America or we will show you how we earned the right to be America in the first place.   Let Iraq be Iraq, too.  It's their first shot at having a representative government and these people want to return an evil, genocidal dictator to power because they decided our military intervention is illegal.  Well, guess what?  There are no laws on war.  And contrary popular belief, the USA is the only country that has ever even pretended to follow the Geneva Convention, so don't bring that up, either.  Okay, so I lied about the rant being over.  Sorry.  Anyway, visit  urlLink IMAO !  Frank J. rocks.  He is a genius.  He is brilliant.  I was not paid to say that.  Definitely not.

        urlLink Comments on Michelle Malkin's Blog   I have to listen to moonbats invade my blog and insist that I'm an 'unwitting tool' of conservatives (after, since I'm black, I couldn't ever have an ORIGINAL thought of my own!).  Wow.  That hits it right on the head.  Multiculturalism and Affirmative Action really are stooping to new levels of racism.  So's education and public services.  Did you know that, because my parents weren't immagrants and I'm white, I'm not qualified to be an entrepenrur?  That's what all the books and handouts say.  Funny.  I have my own business...

        A minor political note, if you're interested in such things. The other day a young girl came to the door to solicit my support for her presidential candidate. I asked her why I should vote for this man. She was very nice and earnest, but if you got her off the talking points she was utterly unprepared to argue anything...  Read the  urlLink whole thing .  Lileks ability to see the  astounding ,  incredible  irony in everyday humans inspires me.

         urlLink LILEKS (James) Matchbooks : "In the olden days there were no downloadable font packages, or Quark; you had to put this stuff together by hand. (As opposed to the psychokinetic processes artists use today, yes, yes, I know. Shut up.) " I probably shouldn't be reading Lileks again, he's bad for my delicate sensibilities, but I do appreciate someone who knows that  telekinetic  means something moving far away, and  psychokinetic  means moving something with your mind.  Big difference.  Lileks!  Your reference to Quark reveals you as the Mac user you are!  I scoff at your dock-clicking silver-cased non-Windows computing!  Awk!  Sorry... think my medication just wore off... that or I've been reading too much about Chomps on  urlLink imao.us .

       Well, last week someone wrote a letter to the editor here ( urlLink Garden Island Newspaper ) saying "anyone who saw Kerry's acceptance speech can see what a wonderful, intelligent, truthful, brave, etc, etc, man he is."  Like I said on  urlLink RWN , these people live in a fantasy world. Any brainwashed idiot would see the above delusion. Anyone else would wonder "why, after talking about his childhood, his college days, and reminding us  again  that he served in Vietnam, did Kerry fail to mention being a United States Senator for  19 years ?"  There are three answers to that question:   He can't run on his record in the Senate because he doesn't have one. As many have pointed out, this man has been a Senator for almost two decades and has no accomplishments. He hasn't proposed a single important bill, at least not one that passed.   If he mentioned serving as a Senator, people might just look into that, and discover he's missed nearly 80% of his votes this year, and nearly 50% last year. He doesn't even show up for work. Kerry doesn't do the job he already has and he wants a promotion. Go figure.   A simple glance at his voting record would reveal him as being  far  from the centrist he's trying to cast himself as. Kerry is so liberal....  how liberal is he?   He's so liberal, he can't decide if he'd rather kill babies or Jews.

       Okay, it's Sunday morning, I've had a headache and body aches since Thursday night.  Hurts to move my eyes.  Not liking this.  Won't even make it to church today, still have a fever.  Probably no posts until I'm better, except maybe whiny "I'm sick" posts like this one.

         urlLink Director joins anti-Bush forces with new film : "'I'm very nervous about this election, because we're all going to go to hell if George Bush wins,' (Spike) Lee says, pointing out recent job losses suffered by Whoopi Goldberg and Linda Ronstadt after they spoke up against Bush."   Wow. Hmm. What can I say? Anyone who reads this blog knows that I don't really swear, but, all I can think of is: WHAT A F$$%ING MORON. Brainwashed, biased, can't see truth in front of him liberalism at it's best. On what do you base that, Mr. Lee? What Michael Moore told you when you met with him and his bodyguards, who, despite his being a renowned gun control advocate, were carrying firearms? I'm not sure which pisses me off more, Spike Lee's idiocy or Michael Moore's duplicity.  I am really getting tired of the liberal elite spouting off tirades of falsehood that are immediately soaked up by the believing masses when those same elites can not give a single rational argument for what they just said. It's like, "well, so and so said it" or "everyone knows" or "anyone can see..."  You know why I hate that illogic with such passion that I could destroy it in a fit of rage were it a tangible entity? I'll tell you.  Because it's the illogic every fool racist I grew up with in Texas used to justify his slant.  "It's common knowledge that the black man's intelligence is inferior to the white man's" I was told time and time again. Or "everyone knows that Mexicans can't be trusted, turn your back on them and they'll steal..." I didn't buy it then and I don't buy it now. I know I have a high IQ. I know I read more than most people. But I really, honestly don't think I'm all that much smarter than the average person, and I don't understand for the life of me how anyone with a head on their shoulders could accept such an argument even for a second. It says to me that you don't question anything but believe whatever you're told. If you want me to believe you without any argument or fact-checking, you better be able to answer to YHWH.  Just realized the other reason I hate it. The "it's obvious" response to something you see that I don't, that's implying "what's wrong with you that you can't see it?" It's so full of  pride ,  arrogance ,   hautiness  . No wonder these people support John F. Kerry.

        Yesterday from  urlLink RWN :    I really, truly, mean no disrespect to our friends in the coalition, but everyone should be aware of what a military alliance actually entails these days. It's like a load being pulled by an American elephant, a British mule, and a horde of nations that have let their militaries atrophy down to the point that they're the equivalent of field mice. You may appreciate the help of the field mice, but do not forget how much of the load they are actually carrying...   Today from  urlLink Y! News :    ...the African Union plans to beef up its troops to some 3,000 soldiers...  Amazing to see the "field mice" analogy so vividly portrayed so soon. I did a little research on the African Union: 53 nations with a total population estimated at around  1.021   billion . Now, the US, with a population of around 275 million has a standing army of some 1.4 million. That's 0.5% of the population, or 1 in 200. By that ratio, the AU should have a force of some 5.1 million. But they have 3,000. 3k. Three-comma-zero-zero-zero. Wait, check that. They don't even have 3k yet, they want to  build up  to 3k. Go figure. And they think they can acomplish anything beyond small-region scale police activities? If America is really into conquest as the moorites insist, why don't we just conquer Africa? Plenty of land and it sounds like  they  sure wouldn't be able to stop us.

         My question is not "is this police presence an infringement on our rights... blah blah blah" like most liberals would ask. In the face of a credible threat of an al Qaida attack on this building, I would much rather have police than terrorists. My question is: "is the figure above the awning in the top right a police sniper, a citigroup spec ops sniper, or a hired ninja guard?"      Guess that answers that question! I would love to have his job.  Pictures are from Reuters from Yahoo! news.
