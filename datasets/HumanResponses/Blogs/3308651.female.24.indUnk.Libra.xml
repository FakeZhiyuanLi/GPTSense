      My dog is technically still a little baby puppy boy.  He's 5 months going on 23-year-old-drunk-college-male.  Mommy is not very proud of this.  No, no--not going to harp on the sexual exploits and conquests of some of the 23-year-old-drunk-college-males I know, as some of those conquests might have to include, ahem, me.  No, I'm pissed that he imitates the humping, ball-licking, all-around-ew habits of said 23-year-olds.   We were going for a walk the other day.  Pretty as you please...people pass us--Blonde in tight jeans:"Ooooh what a cute puppy!"...Annoying snotty five year old child in chocolate-stained t shirt:"Mommy I want one!!!"...Older woman whose feet pour over the top of her hushpuppies:"What breed of dog is that you have, young lady?" Jack pays no attention to the compliments heaped upon him.  He is above the adoring reactions of mere humans to his "awwww" cuteness and misleading miniature nature.  Jack wants to get laid.  This means now.  This means if you trust him for a second to bend over and tie your shoelaces, you shall be defiled.  After getting up (difficult) and looking around to be sure that all the people who saw your dog trying to hump you aren't people you know personally, you look at the dog.  He looks back up at you, cute little head cocked to the side.  His lagging tongue and open mouth seem to be smiling at you--mocking you.  "Hehehe...you moron.  Don't bend over in front of me!  I am Jackson The Jack Russell and I've been put on this earth to hump."  He cocks his head to the other side.  "Now, we've learned a lesson, haven't we?"  Barks.  "That's right.  There is a reason that God spelled backwards is Dog.  Now let's go dig ourselves a hole in your comforter cover, shall we?"   I will include a picture of Jack sometime soon when I figure out how to do it.  Please take a look and let me know if you have a potential girfriend for him.  We would be much obliged.  Have dick.  (And balls, although we need to discuss how long THAT is going to last for.) Will travel.

      One of my friends was visiting this past weekend... he's one of those people who say things that people repeat for years: "Listen, if you ever lose me in the woods, or something, don't stop looking for me after a few weeks, ok?  I might still be alive, living off river water and bark sandwiches."   Weirdo.

      Nothing to say right now.   Meekness has never, ever been a quality of mine.  So that's not (I don't think) what I am today.   Hungover, however, IS something that leaves one  veritably speechless.   So that must be what it is.   C'mon, Jiminny Cricket...where were you last night when I needed you?

      It's both very fun and extremely exhausting to go out the way we did both weekend nights.  We went to some gay college bar (previously stated) on Friday, drank a LOT!  And ended up at one of my friend's homes out in east butt fuck...like 15 minutes out of town.  Stayed up there until early in the morning.  I convinced everyone to make it back onto campus and to one of the boys' fraternity before that happened.  We were there until 11a.m.  whoa.  Slept all day once I got home.  Woke up at 7p.m.  Took a shower...called some people...donned a short, frilly, peach silk skirt from Abercrombie and went out.  Drank:  Bacardi.  Out of character for me once again.  Up until noon the next day...  Met some guy S out whom I haven't seen in months.  It's great to see someone who has changed a lot, physically and mentally, since the last time...he's seperated from his wifey (whom I never liked because she used to flirt incessantly with an ex of mine) and was attached to me all night on saturday.  He's called 2 times since...haven't called him back.  Not very interested.    On another note, the older man I've been seeing has really been surprising me.  His level of interest, paired with how sensitive and caring he is, makes him a joy to be around.  However, 22 years is a lot of distance, time, and baggage to cross and carry in a relationship.  These things are hard enough as it is.  We'll see what happens.

      Friday...I love fridays.  They are always so promising, thoughts of the weekend ahead, all the drunken debauchery that is to come--I often find myself thinking: "what shall we drink tonight, Katrina?"  I think apple martinis are on the wish list.  Mmmm.   My friend Misty and I went out together on Wednesday night.  Not a typical night for drinking and staying out until all hours...but I haven't really been out on the town here in almost a month, and neglected my usual tuesday night binge, so I was reaaaaaring to go.   Misty is gorgeous.  Killer body, thin as a rail with huge boobs that cost her a pretty penny, to say the least.  She had them done through her belly button, under the muscle...which leaves one without a scar to show for your voluntary, ahem, enhancements, and perfect, perky, head-turning tatas.  I love going out with her, as she is a ton of fun with this great English accent that comes out when she drinks.  Guys go nuts.  I don't mind the attention that I recieve as the "friend".  At all.  Misty says the same thing about me but I know she's just being nice.   So Wednesday...we met our friend Frank out at a small billiards place, which is packed on random weeknights with people who have nothing to do the next day.  Saw an old roommate there, he's a pool shark and goes home hundreds of dollars richer every time he goes out.  I've never known anyone that could do that, save one of my sorority sisters, May, who can go to a bar with no money and ends up coming home with like, $15.  And no, she isn't giving blow jobs in the bathroom, or letting strangers cop a feel on the dance floor.  She thinks that guys give her money to hand to the bartender and that she puts the change in her purse, not thinking, (drunk).  Sounds like a very crafty lady to me.   So we polish off a pitcher there...miller light, spank you very much...and I have to admit that as I drink more, I become increasingly better at pool.   Everyone decides to head off to the local gay bar afterwards.  I used to date one of the bartenders there...(not gay, mind you)...and know basically everyone that works there.  However, I haven't been in ages, and it was great to see everyone again!  Frank loves that place and is great friends with the owner...we have to wonder about Frank every now and then...the boy dresses like a model and has such a pretty/perfect face...always smells good and has his hair done...comments on your outfit and has been known to say: "Nu-uh giiirl!  You need to trot your little ass right back into that bedroom where you came from and change that so-last-year shirt!"  I know, I know.  Wonder???  But Frank always has a girlfriend, and never hits on guys...so we can only suppose.  He's the best.   Misty and I were taking shots at the bar...(blowjob shots, of course--for some reason gay men love watching women take those???) and I noticed the Greek friend I'd been on a few dates with a little while ago was there.  I finished my shot, patted Misty on the back, and gave her the brief DL...he's sweet, but a Marine and kinda crazy like that...which isn't a bad thing at all but I've already been there and done that...anyway, liked him, except for the fact that he has this posture problem...He's 6'4 but still manages to look meek and shy...shoulders slumped and almost, well, should I say fatty???  I can't tell...I just didn't like that demeanor.  He also had this habit of staring at me...which is cute for like, 4-5 seconds, but when you look away and look back and the boy is still entranced, you have to ask: "What????"  and it kind of ruins the moment.  Greeky didn't have much to say and I stopped calling him about two weeks ago.  So, I'd still like to say hello and see how he's been, and I can tell out of the corner of my eye that he's spotted me.   Misty and I walk over and I say hello, how've you been, yada yada...and Greeky is very nice and happy to see me.  All of a sudden his body is pulled sideways and I look down to see a minuscule individual literally pulling his arm out of his socket.  "We're leaving!" Mini-me states.  She's frizzy-blonde, kinda trashy...but hey--if he's here with her I'm happy for him.  I say goodbye, nice to see you...although it was hard not to laugh with the little chihuahua's eyes trying to bore a gunshot-wound sized hole through my face.   Misty and I go up to the DJ booth, fuck around with the guys a little...the DJ is (straight) and a good friend of mine from the bartender's-girlfriend days, so we take more shots and I drop Misty off at home, wasted.   Get back to my house, recall eating a can of tuna.   I was getting into bed at 2ish and took a look at my cell phone...and Greek boy had called a while after he left the bar.  I didn't know if it was important or not, no message, and figured, what the hell...and called back.  This is hilarious--I thought I'd been morphed back to high school for a moment.  The chihuahua answers Greeky's cell, and starts screaming, demanding why the fuck I was calling him, etc.  I informed her that she needed to direct any questionning toward Greeky, who had called me.  I was simply returning the call to see what he'd wanted.  (Which is pretty obvious).  She put him on the phone and I told him that I would talk to him at a later date, which would probably be in his best interest if he didn't want to ruin the rest of his night.  He conceded.   I got off the phone and laughed my ass off.  Honey, I don't want your man--if that's what you think he is.  He's obviously not quite ready to be that...but I won't be the one to take him from you.  I wasn't interested before and certainly am not brought to be by another woman.  I don't work like that.   He called again yesterday apologizing for the yapping girl.  I haven't called him back...I figure we'll run into another again sometime and I'll laugh at him a little...I don't really respect men without a backbone.  I'm not trying to be harsh here at all...I really am sincerely amused.   Ok...I suppose I ought to work for a bit.

      I don't like talking about myself very much.  You're like, "yeah, right..."  but it's true.  In most cases you are brought to talk about yourself--not your opinions, or your dreams, but just "YOU"--in situations where you barely know someone, and you're commanded, not asked, to "Tell me more about yourself."  Ugh.  I'll let you know in my own good time, asshole, and stop telling me what to do!  This usually occurs on a date or in a job interview, which for all intents and purposes is the same thing--at least you get paid for one of them.   However, I feel that since I don't know anyone reading this, or if anyone even will, I need to let you know the basics.  I'm a girl.  I'm 24.  Graduated with a dual degree in english and communications.  Single.  Direct a department in my company.  Love my job.  Am very good at it.  Hence the extra time I have to write this.  Boss is completely taken by me and thinks I'm God's gift.  I am an excellent actress.   I spend on average 2 days a week completely hungover.  I remember being able to drink a lot more than I do now (speaking of which: SE australian red wine, vodka, beer and champagne...favorites in that order) in college (shots, beer, and deathpunch) and wake up without a hangover.  Livers should not be allowed to deteriorate.  We need them more as we grow older.  I could have spent days cuddled up in bed with asprin, water, and ramen noodles by my side and never missed anything in college.  Now, I have to drag my sorry ass out of the house by 7:30 a.m. and look as though I got a hell of a lot more sleep than 3-4hours, sit through meetings all day being innovative, driven and intelligent, not eat ANYTHING that could disturb the sleeping lion which is my stomach, and do this all with a smile.  I could definitely use more liver now than I had then.  I didn't need it then.  I took it for granted. Now that it sucks and is broken I look back on those days with so much regret and longing.   Anyway...what else?  I speak another language.  I am very proud of this.  That is why I try to speak it to every person I ever meet that speaks it.  This usually occurs when I have had at LEAST three glasses of wine, and if my fellow countryman is lucky enough, a dirty martini or two.  Slurring a different language with an american accent.  Greeeeat.  So special.  I wonder why I am single sometimes and then I suddenly remind myself.   I am tall...5'10...and wish that I were a little, munchkin-sized 5'3 or 5'4 blondie.  I love how those little bitches are always getting picked up and carried off by guys.  I have always wanted to be picked up like that, and think it is the most romantic/sexy thing in the world.  But nooooo, beanpole over here just kept growing and growing and now I get the "are you a model" question all the time which would be great and grand if I WAS a model, but as I plainly inform the "do you model" people, that would require losing about 20 lbs, and it ain't gonna happen.   I think that's enough for now.  I'm even boring myself.

      I would hate to get all politi-co on this...so I'm not going to.  But that really sucks.  I wonder what kind of people could really physically cut someone's head off.  Ew.  People are sick in this world, and you have to wonder how human these people are--and then to say that they are doing what they do in the name of God.  Call me what you will, but I think we should just bomb the fuckers.

      A man that works in the commercial part of our company was diagnosed with throat cancer.  A radical surgery removed his voicebox, leaving him with a gaping hole in his neck that looked like a gunshot wound.  They replaced his scratchy voice with an artificial one that makes him sound like Gollum from Lord of the Rings.  He wears a bandana over the hole it so as not to shock anyone...I'm assuming that's why--although for all intents and purposes it might just be so that he doesn't inhale any dust or small insects.  He stands outside the shop countless times throughout the course of the day and moves the bandanna to the side to hold a cigarette up to the hole.  And they say nicotine isn't addictive???

      So...Two of my best girlfriends recently made the move to SouthBeach...to the sun, the surf...the frozen drinks and the beautiful bodies.  Sounds great, huh?  The last time I was there we had an absolute blast...partying every night, sunning ourselves by their resort-style pool...just great.  I left, however, feeling as though I was leaving something behind, again--as I always do when I leave any of the girls since college.  And there is always something slightly more glamorous, more sophisticated and cool about everyone else's lives lately.  I return to mine as one wakes to their warm bed after a great dream...comfortably, but still thinking about how different things could be.  Hoping, essentially, that there is some remnant of that dream lingering on you that could impermeate your life throughout the course of the day...that you could become it.   I can't figure out if I ought to do that to myself again...visit for the weekend, breathe in the lifestyle and the differences it has from mine...and return here to another week of work.  I don't know how appealing that sounds.   Fuck it.  I'm going.  Must I whine so much?   This is the itinerary:   Arrive Thursday:  Commence drinking immediately after catching up with girlfriends about the various unstable relationships(at least I have the balls to say it) you've been going through. Get dressed.  Look absolutely stunning. Go out.   Have a great time dancing, flirting, and being predominantly unavailable.  Go home at 4 or 5 with the girls and whatever straggling boys are still hoping to get a piece.  Pass out. Friday: Wake up next morning hardly remembering anything from the night before.  Note that head hurts enough to tell you that you had fun.  Think to self: "Self, we mustn't drink so much tonight."   Lay out, get tan, drink frozen drinks to cure hangover.  This works.   Repeat night before...although slightly more stunning with tan.   Saturday: Wake up with much worse hangover than day before.  Sleep until at least noon.  Complain about headache.  Wonder how many boys got the wrong number from you last night.  Laugh to self.   Get dressed.  Choose to wear the shortest skirt known to man.  Wonder if this may be a bad idea come the latter part of the evening.   Sunday: Wake up.  No idea what happened the night before.  Friends tell you about dancing on tables.  Try to laugh to self...at the same time as you think about how many people probably saw your underwear.  Smile knowing that you wore the cutest pair of lacy-boy-shorts on the market.  Pat self on back.   Spend time with friends, catching up with the boding feeling of having to leave very soon.  Say tearful goodbyes and wonder why you don't do this more often.   Drive home depressed and hungover.  Plan your move to SouthBeach which is probably never going to happen.    So, do I still think I should go?   Lemme think about that one for awhile.  I'll tell you about it tomorrow.    Sweet dreams...

      Ok, so...I've been bored long enough and on so many occasions that I think I'd be better off putting it down on the proverbial paper.  Not that anyone cares but myself...I'm sure.  So there'll be no one to offend but me--and I rarely find myself offensive.  Much to the contrary, actually, I usually tend to amuse myself.  Like right now.  So this is where I start.

      1.  MILKING IT: When stroking a guy's dick don't grab it like a bus rail and start jerking it like you were milking a cow. Don't use the love sword as if it's a piece of gym equipment to strengthen the forearms. The male organ is a thing of wonder and beauty, and should be awed, worshipped and held tenderly at all times. The sensitive part is at the top (where your face should be), not two-thirds of the way down.  2. ROBOTS: When sucking a guy's dick don't just get on the end of the thing and jam your head back and forward. It's a beautiful instrument; it should be caressed, inspected, kissed and licked from every possible angle.  3. SILENT FRIGHT: If you've come and cannot be coerced to scream to show your appreciation, at least make some sort of sign to inform the guy that he's done his duty and can blow his biscuits whenever he wants.  4. NO LAUGHING MATTER: Don't laugh if your creative male lover gets carried away and says things like, "I want to rinse your mouth with my fresh, white love potion." Laughter at any aspect of the male performance will not enhance it. Just be grateful you've got a guy who can speak in whole sentences.  5. CLOSING UP: If a man is willing to take the trouble to come on your face, don't close your eyes. He wants you to share this ecstatic moment of joyful union and love with him. Semen is not likely to cause permanent blindness in most cases - but this is a risk you should be prepared to take for his happiness.  6. POOR PRESENTATION: Presentation is all important. Don't wait to be asked to get it doggy-style. Roll over and present. You know you love it.  7. HANGING AROUND: When he is done, you should not kiss and cuddle, he does not want to touch you. You should leave the bed and leave him in peace. If you are a one-night stand you should leave the premises without thieving anything or asking for a phone number. His work is done.  8. BEING SHY: Always offer the Hershey Highway. You know you love It. If you don't like it that much, still offer it as you can quite easily play with yourself as he rams away.  9. BEING A DRIP: You always have tissues in your bag, use them to clean his sheets and any ball bag drippage if you have misbehaved and not swallowed everything.  10. CLOCK-WATCHING: Never, ever, ever, ever even think of saying: "Are you going to come soon." If you're doing a blowie, you'd have to take your mouth off to utter the question. If you're giving a hand-job, you should have gone to the gym to work your biceps. If he's shagging you and takes more than 10 minutes you should be grateful. This is not a time trial but a blissful act of union between two sexually aware and gifted human beings.  11. FISHING FOR COMPLIMENTS: Don't ask him if you're the best lover he's ever had most men have had so many sexual partners that it is unlikely that you are. Please don't ask a man to lie about such an important thing.  12. PLAYING DEAD: Don't just lie there, do something. Good sex is not a spectator sport and it helps if both parties move around a bit. I know you expect the men to do all the hard and skillful work. We don't mind that and we're blessed with the equipment and know-how to do it but at least put some effort into the act to show your appreciation.  13. BEING POSSESSIVE: If you are lucky to have an imaginative lover who can satisfy two women at a time don't sneer at or reject his exciting suggestion that one of your friends joins you to make up a threesome. If he's a real man he's probably shagging her anyway. Plus you might learn something from her to keep your man really happy.  14. NOT KEEPING YOUR HAIR ON: Don't shave all your pubic hair off. It makes your snatch look like a piece of poultry past its sell-by date. At best, it looks like the snatch of a ten-year-old. If you want to trim, go for a nice sexy racing stripe in the manner favored by the Playboy models that your man would rather be shagging.  15. SPITTING IT OUT: When a man has gone to so much trouble to ejaculate and get his aim right into your mouth, it is rude to spit it out without savoring taste and gluey texture. You should play with semen like a block of Hubba Bubba, blowing bubbles, chewing and throwing from side to side. A line like "I love it when you come in my mouth" makes for a happy finale to fun and games.  16. BEING UNGRATEFUL: Never forget to thank a man for all the effort and energy he has expended on making love to you - especially if a)sex has lasted more than five minutes and/or b)you managed to achieve an orgasm. A man's role in sex is far more demanding than a woman's so it is always nice when one's prowess is appreciated.  17. SEEKING FAVORS: Never contemplate taking advantage of your man's warm after-sex glow to seek favors or make requests. As he drops off into well-deserved slumber, resist the urge to ask, "Do you think I should buy that dress, skirt, sofa, Mercedes, country cottage?" There is a name for the practice of mixing sex with material gain - prostitution.

      I've been in Montana for a few days now...the weather has been beautiful and I'm more relaxed after 4 days here than I've been in months.  Work, boy troubles, financial concerns...all of that washes away with the dirt after a 5 mile hike.  I'm looking out a huge bay window to the mountain range a few miles away, and Big Mountain is right behind us.  It's a 1/4 mile walk to the chairlift that takes you right to the summit, and a few of us have been up there every night this week to get a few beers and watch the landscape change with the setting of the sun.  (Which doesn't set until around 10:30 at night..kinda confusing body-clock wise.)  Moose Drool is my new favorite beer: kinda like Guiness but better, it has a mild chocolate/coffee taste in the foam that is just mmmm.    We're going to do a "walk in the trees" today...some 60-100 feet up in the trees there's a boardwalk of sorts.  I have a very strange feeling that I'm going to be petrified of the height...scardycat.    I'll post more later tonight after a glass of wine or two.    It's nice to be so calm again!

      So I'm getting on the highway last night at about 6:30...just leaving work.  I want to get home, change for the gym, bust out a quick workout, and get home to EAT.  Lunch sucked, nasty chicken teriyaki that made my stomach turn.   The kind that makes you begin to wonder about what really does go into chinese food... Anyway, as soon as I reach the on ramp I see that my plans are not going to work out tonight.  There is standstill traffic from the onramp to the offramp for my exit...which is 5 miles away, over the next hill in the distance.   Fuck.   I get very irritable when I don't work out, and I didn't get a chance to do more than walk my dog on Tuesday, so the trip to the gym was going to be a good thing for me as well as for those who deal directly with me, or are within projectile distance the next day.   45 minutes and 5 miles later, I pass the accident that caused the traffic: two rednecks in one of those converted-into-living-space trucks with tinted windows and peeling paint.  They were fine, perhaps their mullets were slightly ruffled and their jeans a little more torn...and were picking up clothes, dishes, and other redneck odds and ends from the side of the road, throwing them back into their atrocity on wheels and actually climbed into the tow truck with the driver...who seemed to be of the same persuasion.   All of this waiting for, well, that.  Not that I would have rathered a train wreck, but c'mon, people! I don't know why I'm telling you this story, except for how it put what happened later in such a different light... I got off of my exit, and headed toward my side of town.  Passing under the overpass for the highway, I noticed a BMW pulled up into the grass on the median, and several cars slowing down to get around it.   Immidiate irritation on my part.  "What the fuck, not again!"   As I passed the hold up everything changed.  A businessman, extremely well dressed, very prestigious-looking, was opening his passenger side door.  He was in his undershirt and had wrapped in his crisp white dress shirt an injured eagle.  Blood was staining his chest and seeping through the shirt he held tightly to him.  He placed the eagle gently on the tan leather of his front seat.   That I was so concerned about getting home to be completely pissed about a car accident...and this person, who was probably stuck in the same traffic jam...probably had kids and a wife to get home to...would stop to pick up an animal from the road...was probably one of the more beautiful things I've seen in my life.   There's beauty everywhere around you--just gotta slow down to see it.    On another note, I was missing Boston and my friends a lot again the other day...and found  urlLink this guy .

      I had a choice between two movies last night...a comedy (the one with the siamese twin brothers...forget the name) and  urlLink Monster , the movie with Charlize Theron as a prostitute gone serial killer.   What a downer.  Shitty family life combined with rape and abuse at a young age--perennial homelessness...I bawled my eyes out twice during this flick--sobbed--and went to bed depressed.   It is so touching to me that people in the worst of life's circumstances still have the ability to love, and to love selflessly, even though the object of their affection may or may not be worthy of it, as well as the way that they demonstrate or feed that love might be skewed.   I really started thinking about myself, and the turns my life has taken since I was a little girl.  I wondered for the first time if things really always are as they should be...which makes it so much easier to accept things that you cannot change.   Wow...all of this introversion when I could have been laughing my ass off at Matt Damon.  Fuck me.   On another note, this is the mass email one of my friends just sent to all of us.    "S and J are having a Boy!!!!  They saw the weiner in the ultrasound today.....i'm going to have a nephew!"  Unbelievable.  She said weiner.  I replied with my congratulations and her company spammed the message.  Hahaha.   You can't say weiner.  What if I was inviting her to my barbeque and asked for some staples???  My 4th of July would be ruined because of her company's excessively sensitive spam protection.  What if I worked for Oscar Myer?  Would we ever be able to email one another?  I can see us all now...sitting around an empty grill with buns waiting for...nothing.

      I haven't written anything here lately, as I have been living vicariously through real bloggists and am totally immersed in their daily lives.  There's one here on blogger, actually--Kev--whose blog called  urlLink Life at TJ's Place  is hilarious.  It's funny, reading the work and taking a small glimpse, I guess, into the minds of others reassures me as to how absolutely boring I am.  Maybe it's time to do something drastic...(I just thought to myself "like cutting my hair" and realized that I am absolutely lame)...or like, hmmm...going skydiving.  SOMETHING!      I did make it to Boston this weekend.  I actually left wednesday of last week and returned on sunday.  Quite a trip.  Haven't seen some of those people since last may!  Including the little sis...so it was a somewhat emotional time.  Oh ya, and we went out a lot.  10 of us, all from college.    One of the girls thought it'd be a great idea to pull my skirt up in front of an entire army of hairy italian (no offense, I love italians) construction men at 1 in the morning.  That was wonderful.  I was not happy.  The construction men were, surprisingly.  I take it that they haven't seen a piece of ass in a while.  This one more than made up for that, I hope, in size, thickness, and length of viewing-time.    They stopped traffic, stopped what they were doing, and started following the group of us down the street, shouting "Do it again!!!"  Which my very obliging friend proceeded to do.  Again, I'm not happy.  I start running in the general direction of the bar we're heading to--trip and almost fall.  Luckily I'd made it around the corner by that time, and I was coherent enough later on that night to pull said friend's super-low-cut shirt to either side when she was talking to a group of guys.   Tit, I guess, for Tat. Or fat?     Thanks Kev...you inspired me to do something aside from work again.    I'm leaving for Montana next Friday--so excited!  Hiking, swimming, drinking...10 days of pure HELL.   Just kidding, although it will be if I don't get my ass on a treadmill sometime soon.    Actually, I went for a run yesterday with the puppy and it was the first time that I have ever worn him completely out.  I was exceedingly proud of myself.  We got back to the house (I was practically dragging him) and he lay right down on the cold tile floor, panting.  I gave him a bowl of water and he looked up tragically at me as if to say "I'm not going to make it!" and gave the bowl a few pathetic little licks while still spread-eagled on the floor.  There should be no reason for me to feel so accomplished, but I do.  I was gloating all night.  "Haaahaaaa, little doggie!  You suck!  I'm much better!  You need some 7-minute aabs...and I'll throw in the 8th one for free!"  Puppy doesn't quote movies with me, though, so that soon came to an end, especially after he ran into the mudhole (it's been raining a shitload) in the backyard and dug himself a nice little bathtub there.  Asshole.    Ok...I need to work again.  Curses to the inventor of a 5 day work week.

      10/02/03  N,  I respect what you said in your email, as well as your points from last night.  However, I cannot transcend the feeling of how absolutely wrong this is—that us being apart is not what is meant to be for either of us.  I can see past the cold N that your family was shocked by at the dinner table.  I can hear in your un-shaking voice the strains of denial.  I can tell in your unfeeling embrace that you, too, are trembling inside.  I understand and accept that the wrongful, hurtful things I’ve done and said over the past year and a half can seem like a mountain, an insurmountable wall between us.  But that is when you look at what has been wrong in our relationship without any recollection of the beautiful, soulful, strong and enduring moments that we have had...the nights of making dinner and holding each other, the simple way of being that we are able to enjoy with one another.  There are things that we believe in and downfalls in our character that separate us at times...things that can seem like they would keep us apart forever—if we let them.    Compromise is a part of every relationship we will ever have in life:  with our families, co-workers, lovers and friends.  It isn’t always easy, either...to let go of something that you want, something that you’ve believed...but more often than not, the opinion that you have had is not the only route, nor is it necessarily correct.  I have learned that about so many things in the past two years.     I haven’t been the best girlfriend, and you did not have to force me to recognize that. I know it, just as I haven’t been the best person at all times, either.  However, everything in my life has directed me toward the development of better character, the growth of my love for myself as well as for others.  It isn’t easy to be a good person, to give your all to everyone and everything in your life.  It is especially hard when that route has proven to hurt you in the past.  We’ve both felt that pain before.  But people have to keep trying.  You can’t give up on the ones that you love, as they should never give up on you.  When you stop loving you start to die inside, and there is that much less beauty in the world.  Please, N, give me a chance to right where I have wronged you.  The past two weeks haven’t been a true example of our relationship, as the cold, unfeeling N is not the person that I have known, and No...it is NOT who you are.  You are a sweet, caring, soft and loving person.  Please let me show you that side of myself a little more, and let me back in to the baby that I have known.  We may not be the same two people that met washing cars on that sunny day...but we are NOT different now because of disenchantment, bad times, or fights.  We are different now from those two distinctly single people, those two lives crossing paths, because our paths are one and the same now.  We are walking towards the same goals, the same developments, and we have one another to lean on in each and every hard time.   I will never be able to look on the wrong I have done to you without feeling a horrible pain...one that could never equate with how I am sure I have made you feel.  But I know that when I try to recall the times I was upset by you, the bad names that were called, anything that I might try to add to that wall...They keep falling off, like bricks sliding on one another, due to the tremendous strength of the love I have for you and the mortar of good things you have done for and with me.    N, I am dying inside today...not only because I am not with you but because I know that I have wronged you by not being there in the right ways at times, by not opening up for fear of rejection, by not telling you enough how much you mean to me.  There are no excuses for that.  No excuses...but that doesn’t change the power of my love for you.  I have been a crappy person at times, but that has never affected how much I love you.  You are everything to me, honey...the sun, the moon, the stars...We were meant to cross paths that beautiful day.  We have also, in a strange and inexplicable way, been meant to endure some hard times in our relationship.  My feelings for you have grown stronger with every compromise, with every step over a problem en route to the rest of our lives together.  Please give me the chance to be a better person for you.  Please give me the chance to love you without fear or inhibitions.  Please give me the chance to hold you once again, baby, to kiss your beautiful face.  I can’t do this without you, N, and I want to be there for you through everything, too.   Remember how good we are together...honey...please think about the love that we share.  It is stronger than anything that tries to get between us...whether that be someone else or even me!  I can’t beg you enough...I can’t cry hard enough...I am just hoping that you can remember, that you can sit back and close your eyes and remember our laughter, and that you will let me be the one for you once again.  I love you with all of the love I have to give, N, and I know that I can be the woman you’ve dreamt of. Please give me that chance.  Love, Kat  And the cold-hearted SOB still had the nerve to break up with me.  Fucker.

      I am   You are the Sun card. The light of the Sun reveals all. The Sun is joyful and bright, without fear or reservation. The childish nature of the Sun allows you to play and feel free. Exploration can truly take place in the light of day when nothing is hidden. The Sun's rays fill you with energy so that you may live life to its fullest, milking pleasure out of each day. Such joy and energy can bring wealth and physical pleasure. To shine in the light of day is to have confidence, to soak up its rays is to feel the freedom of a child.

      I just had a religious experience.  I swear.    Misty waxes everything...I mean, Ev-ery-thang...  And told me about it the other day in the car.    So out of curiosity, mostly, I went.   Wow. Assume the doggy style position...cause they definitely get all of it.    The lady that "did" my brazilian was like, "sweetie, you have the prettiest pussy I have ever seen!!!" (I kid you not) and gave me a mirror to look at myself.  I have to be totally candid about this, but, a shaved or waxed or whatever pussy is the cutest little thing in the world.    I am very full of myself now.    I let her "do" the rest of me just for that.    I have a picture of my arms (aggrgh..those hurt the  most, honest to god...) on my buzznet site.  No hair is def. the way to go.  Everywhere.  I might have to show you more pictures later, because I am so so so so happy about this.

      I was watching the news last night and saw a report on PETA's discovery of chicken abuse at the KFC slaughterhouses.  Initially, I thought; "Duh, you morons!  Of course they're 'abused', they're getting their friggin' heads chopped off for Christ's sake!" However, they had actual video footage of this poultry-flogging, and I was sincerely moved by the plight of these poor chickens.  The workers at the factory were having virtual chicken tossing sessions...one of these guys had an arm on him that should have landed him a spot as a pitcher for the Yankees.  He was tossing the things against a wall at a speed that I swear rivaled that of sound.   I'm looking down at the three or four scars on my heels and then I understand where he's coming from, suddenly.   I was around 10 when we lived in the islands for a while.  It was gorgeous there, hot, sunny, wildlife everywhere--so pristine and natural.  However, a hurricane in the 30's or sometime around then devastated most of the structures on the island, which included (go figure) the local chicken coops.    Chickens were since the stray dogs of Tahiti...running wild through the mountains and making plenty a smelly roadkill.  My little sister and I were enthralled.    Baby chicks are undeniably cute.  Yellow, fluffy, chirping little balls of feathers.  I wanted one more than anything in the world and endeavored to catch one using various different traps...a shoebox with a stick holding one end up, string on stick leading straight through to the bushes...a la Roadrunner (that one never worked.) At some point I had a trail of bread crumbs laid out from the backyard all the way into my bedroom... which led not a baby chick but a very upset mother into the room with a can of whoop-ass in tow.    Anyway, I got within 2 feet of one...once.  Hands cupped, treading lightly, I approached my prey.    "Sqwawhawwwwk!!!!"  Momma chicken was on me like a fly on shit.    Running for my life, I escaped with a few deep gashes (fucker pecked me) on my ankles and no (sigh) chick.    So when I think of the guy and his pecker-tossing, I really don't have any sympathy.  If it bothers them that much, they should go to work in the factory and see how "humanely" they can treat those fuckers.    By the way, I don't eat at KFC.

      Than sitting at home watching movies.  Sure, I've lost my voice and I think I'm getting sick now, but what the hell. If I die of over-exhaustion and over-a lot more things, at least I'll die happy.   We had a great drive down to Boca.  Our friend Bean was the lucky fellow behind the wheel, and Misty and Michelle were with me.  I picked up Michelle (we call her Meechimouse cause she's so blonde and a little cutie pie) first, and we immediately stopped to get some booze for the ride down.  I know it's illegal, but I had a pretty damn blinding headache from the night before, and the hair of the dog is definitely the way to go when you're going to be partying your ass off all night.    We went on to get Misty, who answered the door in her undies with a beer in hand...her third, mind you, at 10 a.m.  She had a headache, too.  She also had a thong on in the courtyard of her apartment complex.  Her neighbors love her.   We arrived at Beaner's and got   his   ass in gear, and off we went.    About 4 pit stops and 12 beers later, we were almost in Boca.  We had a bottle of wine in the trunk that Misty expertly acquired by opening the back seat and crawling amidst our luggage back there.  I've got a few pictures of her butt that I will post for your viewing pleasure tomorrow morning.  I hope you enjoy.   We arrived in Boca to pick up my friend D and her boyfriend, the gargantuan 6'8 basketball player.  He's a sweetie (and pretty damn cute) and she's a tennis player.  Their kids are going to have the bodies of Greek gods.    D's mom broke out some Tiramisu for dessert (my favorite!!!) for her birthday...it was so great to see  how happy her parents were that we were there for that.  It must bring so much joy to moms and dads to see how loved their children are by their friends.    After chitchatting for a while with the rents, we took off.  Another stop at the liquor store for a bottle of Crown and a bottle of Bacardi Melon (YUM!) and we were on our way to Southbeach.  The hour it took us to get there went by in minutes, especially considering that we were pounding Mich Ultra Lights the whole time and listening to some of the great house music stations they have down there.    We got to Washington Ave. and pulled up next to the Bestwestern there.  Totally ghetto, but the room was $85 and no one wanted to pay more for a place we would most likely not end up sleeping in.  The pool had a yellowish tint that I am sure was not the product of the lighting but rather some weird bacterial presence.  Yuk.    We got ready, and I have to admit, we looked damn good.    After hopping from bar to bar for an hour or so, Bed, Presence, and some more places I don't remember, we arrived at Mansion.  I'd link it but can't seem to find their website...it used to be called Level, and the place is enormous.  They have a main room that plays progressive house music and that's where we spent the majority of our night.    Dancing and drinking, we met a lot of people.  Here's one conversation:  Strange looking italian guy:  "Hey ladies, how you doin'?"  Cute ladies (us): "Good, great, awesome...you?"  SLIG: "I'm rolling my face off!!!!"  Us: "Ohkaaay???"  SLIG: "You want one?"  Misty and D: "YES!!!"  Me: "Eeeehhh, I think I'll pass."  See, I used to do that in college.  A lot.  We all did, and Boston was   the   place to do it.  However, spending one night with my eyes rolling back in my head thinking that I was being followed by a pink and purple spotted pulsating octopus was one night too many for me.  I don't go near that shit anymore.  It scares me.    So Misty and D are rolling after an hour or two, and it's approaching 3 in the morning.    Another dude, this time short and fat, approaches.  Short Fat Dude: "Do you lovely ladies want to meet George Clooney?"  Cloud Nine Misty: "Yes yes yes yes yes."  SFD: "He's over there by that bar.  He wants to meet you.  Follow me!"  CNM: "Okay okay okay okay!!!!"  Short Fat Dude brings her over to the bar to meet George, who says hello.    CNM: "You're not George Clooney!  You're not George Clooney! You're not George Clooney!"  (Misty repeats herself constantly when she's on that shit.)   Not George Clooney: "Yes I am!  Here, look at my license."  He shows her his license, which in fact, does list his name as a George Klooney.    Fucking asshole.    There were, however, a mightly fine bunch of men there.  Tall ones, stocky ones, built ones, blonde ones...It was a cornicopia of humpable material.  I didn't have it in me, though, unfortunately.    By the time 6 a.m. rolled around we'd ended up at an afterparty that I have no idea as to how we met the people throwing it.    We had some drinks, some guy tried to throw his girlfriend over the balcony, and we left.  Not much interesting there.  The girlfriend deserved it, anyway.  She threw a drink in his face for not paying her enough attention.  He proceeded to pick her up and lock her in the bathroom.  This made her slightly more angry with him and a little more beligerent.  Drunk girlfriend breaks bathroom door off the hinges.  Goes after boyfriend with nails.  He'd had enough at that point and had her halfway off the balcony before his friends grabbed him.  I kinda wish they'd let him go through with it.    It was a great weekend, and I'm still tired.  My back hurts.  My feet hurt.  I have a bruise on my left butt cheek from some guy (he was cute so I let it slide) grabbing it with all of his might.  I'm going to bed.  Goodnight and sweet dreams!

      He comes to me like this sometimes, a fog through the windows of a darkened room.  Quietly he steps over the low, rusty railing and onto the balcony, pushing the french doors open wider so as to allow himself in.  His hands are tan against the white curtains and I can see his skin glistening at the nape of his neck.  His linen shirt has two buttons undone, and the rest of it is messily untucked... careless, wrinkled.  His body moves slowly, quietly, and I can hear his nervous breath as I awake.    Frightened for a moment as his huge frame looms above me, I wonder if I'm still dreaming, as his shallow breathing becomes more audible.    "Jason?"  "Yes...It's me."  "Is something wrong?  What are you doing here?"  "I needed to see you."  He sits at the edge of the bed next to me and as the breeze sends his smell over my pillow.  Immediately the memories return and I am overwhelmed by their strength.    The first time I laid my eyes to rest on him across the room, in that navy T-shirt and baggy jeans, laughing with his friends.  His laughter stops and his eyes widen.  The open mouth eventually twists into a grin as I look.  Something in my head tightens and I hear a voice tell me  "You're going to marry this man."  Like a ton of bricks the realization falls onto my shoulders.    The fourth of July later that year, with his legs wrapped around me he sits behind me in the boat, rubbing my shoulders.  The embrace, the shivering, I was cold on the outside but so very warm inside and everywhere else.  As the finale is going off over the lake I vaguely recall our friends at the wheel, laughing and drinking their Bud Lights.  They didn't exist as he brushed my hair behind my ear and whispered   "I love you.  I love you more truly and deeply than I've ever loved anyone in my life."  His hand now moves toward my face in the night, and I begin to remember the other times...  The crying, the pain...the thought that dying would feel better than this.    And finally, the emptiness that he left when he was gone.    "What do you want?" I ask him.  He doesn't say a word, but with both hands takes my head and looks at me.  He can look into the very deepest part of my soul, as no one else can, and I feel my body tingle with the touch of his palm on my face.    He kisses me, deeply, and knows that I am his.  I always will be.    As he lifts the sheets slowly to gently enter them, I pull his body towards mine.  I can feel our hearts beating and his strong arms underneath my back, pressing me against him and him against me.  I can't believe that he is back...I want to show him with my body what I can't say to him with my mouth.  "I love you, I need you, I start and I end with you."  And then I wake up.

      Two of my girlfriends and I are driving down to Boca Raton first thing tomorrow morning...hopefully in time for some shopping and dinner out with a friend who is celebrating her birthday this weekend.   One of the girls going with me is Misty...she's described in a previous post...she's a hottie and I have a feeling we're going to have a very good time.  We'll go out in Southbeach Saturday night, drive back on Sunday.    Nothing exciting tonight...dinner and a few cocktails with the gentlemen, I suppose.    I've been thinking about Mint Juleps.  A lot.  Mmmmm.  You've got to love those things: all minty and sweet/sour with a little kick that'll catch up with you after three of them.  Waitress???  My man-toy is going hunting in Argentina for the entire week come Sunday.  I'm going to be all lonely without anyone to play with.  Sniff...sniff...  Nah-I doubt it.    I'm actually one of those people who doesn't mind having the house to herself...I love making dinner with a bottle of wine, painting my nails in front of sex and the city reruns and Seinfeld...I keep myself amused and busy.    I also like being able to walk around the house naked.  You can't do this when someone else is around, no matter how open you may be with your roommates.  Even if you're living with a significant other, I'm a firm believer in the "Good naked, Bad naked" differentiation...and I'd rather not be caught doing laundry in the nude by the person I'm sleeping with.  Just not all that sexually stimulating of a picture, if you know what I mean.  "Honey, should this go in with the colors?"  "Well, I don't know, honey, all I see is nipple, at the moment." Don't get me wrong...I'm not going to start scrubbing the tiles in the bathroom floor in my birthday suit...I just enjoy getting ready after my shower without having to choose an outfit, first.  The occasional scamper across the living room to grab a beer out of the fridge will be done in the nude, as well, if the coast is clear and the lights aren't on when it's dark outside the huge floor-to-ceiling windows.  Ha.  My neighbor will probably catch an eyeful, someday soon, if he hasn't already.

      I heard a song on the radio yesterday by Tim McGraw.  First of all, let me begin by saying that I had never been a big fan of country music...what with growing up where I did and going to college up North...(which is what Southerners say, I guess.)  Anyway, we used to make fun of our southern friends in school...making up fake country songs to sing to my poor sorority sister from Atlanta...they went something like,  Twang twang... I lost my last tooth today Twang twang... My wife left me and so did my dog Twang twang... My trailer done got broke in a hurricane Twang twang... And my girlfriend and I share DNA...  You get the drift.    Anyway, after resisting the Country music scene for more than 2 years, I started dating someone who was not country, per se, but listened to a good deal of the music.  The good stuff.  (This is where I change my tune.)  Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw, George Straight...  (I'm probably not spelling any of this right, but I try)  So I learn that a lot of this genre of music is really, well, just plain good.  Good like, good old american values and love of country...man/wife...instilling respect and love in children, etc.    I kinda like it now.    Back to my story...  This song "Live like you were dying" is on the radio yesterday, and it got me 'a thinkin'.  (That accent is a joke.)  What would you do if you knew you only had a short time to live?  I mean, the big stuff.  The things that you couldn't be on your deathbed without regretting?  I think I have some of mine decided:  -Go to Europe -Allow myself to fall in love -Buy a BMW -Talk to my father -Drop kick my stepmother (twice) -Party in Ibiza -Visit my relatives in Tahiti and go to the place where my mom is -Get in touch with some exes and thank them for the lessons they taught me -Ride a bucking bronco -Sex, sex, sex.  (The one above obviously reminded me.) -Skydive -Stop biting my nails -Quit working--for good -Call my credit card companies and tell them to go fuck themselves while laughing manically -Run for president -Run for Ms. America  Not all in that order, of course.  Duh.  The sex one would be first.    I might have to make a few addendums as they arise.

      The basketball player just called me.  He claims that he would never say anything defamitory about me or our short-lived relationship.  I believe him and am planning the bitches' beatdown.   People don't understand that they should NOT mess with me.  I am one mean bitch when I am wronged.    Now that that is over, this weekend was a blast!    I actually only went out on Friday night with my girlfriends, but we saw everyone I've missed seeing for so long, and had a really good time.  I'm at work right now, but will try to blog about it later on tonight.

      One of my many ex boyfriends plays basketball here. (He lied to me about his age--told me he was older than he really was so that he could date me...loser) I don't think he thought he'd get a piece if I knew that I'd be robbing the cradle.  Apparently he didn't know me too well at that point.   Anyway, I was seeing someone recently whose ex is the biggest, most jealous bitch I've ever heard of in my life.  She's the worst kind, too--she doesn't have any scruples or pride insofar as the jealousy thing is concerned, and has been digging for dirt about me for months trying to ruin the relationship.   Well, jealous ex bitch somehow finds out I used to date Cradle boy.  The two get together.  He tells her things about me that are so untrue they make me sound like a different person.   I ditched cradle boy two weeks into the relationship.  He's young.  He's immature.  And dammit, he has NO idea what he's doing in the bedroom.   He follows me around for a few weeks, we don't talk for a while, and a few months later are friends.    He tells her that I fell in love with him, wouldn't leave him alone, and stalked him for months.  Other things are said, too, that don't make me sound all too good.    Now my question is...why is it that when someone has something horrible to say about another person, it is never "innocent until proven guilty" but the other way around?    I am so angry with him, and even more pissed with this bizzo for spreading rumors.  I don't know if I should call loser boy and tell him that if he doesn't stop lying about me, I'll let everyone know what really happened as well as some additional juicy information about him that he would rather not go public (performance-enhancing drugs, living at the frat house--totally illegal) etc.   I don't know if I should talk to her and let her know about my mean one-two punch.    I don't know if I should just forget about it all and chalk it up to being perfect and having a lot of people jealous of me.    I am really PISSED.  I thought I graduated from High School a long time ago.

      How do I make a list of my links on the right over here>>>>>? I am technologically challenged.   (That is the only way, however, in which I am.) I rock at everything else.   Kidding.

      Ball...because that HAS been known to happen and it isn't pretty.   As with my pussy post this one needs a little sleep.  I am going to try my best not to use any--God forbid--offensive language.  If there's something you need clarification on, it can be done in private. (Wink).   Goodnight.  By the way, thanks, Jay, for the idea for a post.  You're great at sending me off into slumber thinking of something interesting.

      Actually, it's been the other way around for the past two weeks.  We leave Montana tomorrow a.m. and I'm really dreading getting back into the office.  The halogen lights in my office, the constant interruptions, the invariably moronic questions from some of the more indecisive staff...ugh.  Not looking forward to it.  If I trusted myself more to get everything done and have that extra "push" working from home, I'd do it in a heartbeat.  However, I need the subtle competition and the more fast-paced atmosphere to do everything to the best of my ability...so it is with a big sigh and some nostalgia that I end my two week vacation.  Tough life, huh?  I need to quit bitching.    We're doing a 10 mile hike today...I'm pretty psyched.  I think I've lost 5 pounds in a week here. Ha!  It's amazing how much a few hours of cardio a day change your body, as opposed to getting 45 minutes on the treadmill daily (if that) and sitting behind a desk staring at a computer screen the rest of the day.  I can see all of my abs, which kicks ass...but my thighs??? are bigger around then they have ever been.  I guess it's all that climbing...yuk.  Hopefully those will quietly go back to thighland where they came from and leave me the fuck alone.  I do not want to have to buy new pants to accommodate thunder thighs.    I had a very sexual dream last night about an ex of mine...weird.  It was good, too!  Now that's a first.  With him, anyway.  I woke up this morning and found myself trying to get back to sleep to find out what happens next.  Ha.  I told my girlfriends when I came out to the kitchen for coffee and they all laughed.  "I thought he sucked in bed?!" C asked.  "He did," I replied.  They found that funny.

      I don't respect pussies.  Now, please, bra-burning feminatzis...hear me out.  I've heard a lot said about the N word and the terminology in which it is used today...all good arguments, definitely, and none that I'd care to comment about.  It is true that using a word to mean something generalized still puts the word used (and the true meaning of the word) in the same light as what it connotes in this "new" context.  However, I don't like the word "pussy", personally, and never use it to describe or call to attention my, ahem, coochie, cooter, vajayjay, or whatnot.  So I do not think that the word "pussy" being used as a negative term demeans women.   That being said, I don't respect pussies.  A pussy can be one of very many genres of people.   Men are pussies when:  They don't stand for what they believe in and vehemently defend/uphold their beliefs. For example, hippie men that don't back our troops and the president the majority of our country elected.  Go over there and fight on their side, if you feel that way.    If they put women down using degrading terms such as slut, whore, etc.  considering the fact that they, themselves, are most likely the slut/whore that the woman in question was slut/whoring with.  If a man has such fear of a sexually liberated woman, you might as well bend over and take it like the unopinioned female you'd rather see in our society.   If they care more about their image, status, and basic reputation than who they actually are on the inside.  The truth will come out one way or another, guys, and when you walk around like a meathead threatening everyone and starting fights that one day you will be asked to finish, you shall be called a pussy when you end up beat down on the floor.    Women are pussies when: They don't say what they think or believe for fear that they will be shot down for it.  I cannot tell you how much it irks me when these pussies start their sentences with "I don't really know, but..." or "This might be wrong, so..."  Don't open your mouth, hun, if you don't know.  And don't precede your statements with a diminuitive, negating lead-in as it makes you look like an asshole and no one listens to you.   If they kiss men's asses in order to be liked.  Eyelashes batting, knees bent and fawning over the local meathead with hopes of being associated with the gentleman in question.  Not earning a reputation based on your own person as opposed to earning it by association is basis for being called a pussy.  Oh--and the pussy men described above will most likely call you a slut or a whore for it.    I think that's it for now.

      I'm musing a post about pussies tonight.  I'll write more about it tomorrow morning when I'm done thinking about it.  I mean figurative pussies, not literal ones.  Like, men who don't have balls.  Or girls who are gay and don't say what they think.  I'll expound at a later date.  (Sorry, the beirut table calls.)

      I have very realistic dreams.  They oftentimes leave me with a strange feeling all day long, depending on what I experienced in the dream  and the circumstances surrounding it.   Many mornings I awake and sit there, confused and sometimes really disoriented.  It's that feeling..."where the fuck did That come from?" which causes me to quesiton my sanity, and wonder what really goes on in my subconscious.   For example, I have dreams all of the time about my teeth falling out.  I know, that's disgusting--but it's so strange: there usually isn't any blood, and they don't all fall out, just a few.  But I can feel them crumbling in my head and usually get to a mirror in my dream--only to see how awful I look without those teeth.  Sometimes I'll make it for a little while in the dream without anyone noticing that I'm missing a bicusped.  Then, a close friend will look, and "Ugh!  Katrina!  What's going on with your face?" and all hell breaks loose.  I usually wake up around that point, and go on to have a really self-conscious day.  Whoo hoo.   Last night I dreamt about my friends and family.  I was getting on a plane, leaving them all, and I knew that I wasn't going to see them again.  I woke up with the song from Vanilla Sky in my head...the one from the moment before he takes the plunge to conquer his last fear and says goodbye to Sofia.   It makes me wonder where I'm going with this--what my purpose is.  I hadn't seen my sister in over a year when I visited last time, and my friends are slowly dispersing over the United States.  Family is basically nonexistant... Guess I get really philisophical about life's purpose and where I am in all of that when I dream that way.   Eh...might as well forget about it.  Torturing myself trying to figure out "why" is a waste of time.

      We lived in Tahiti for almost 3 years.  During that time, my little sister and I lived the way that my mother grew up: barefoot, topless, and running around loose like little pygmies.   My mom's father was a government official there and raised his entire family in the islands-technically he was the Austrian Consulate to Tahiti as it is part of the French Polynesia, and not it's own country-but no one cares about that.  Anyway...we had to learn french and eat weird food and wear lots and lots of sunscreen.  Some of the best memories from my childhood are of time spent in Tahiti.    Here's a funny one.    Mangoes grow on trees.  Did you know that?  I didn't, until we lived right under three or four of those trees.  What a discovery!  My little sister and I grew up in a yuppie little sheltered town in Connecticut (sorry Johnny) and mom only allowed us two cookies a day-other snacks were always fruit or something healthy.  (Thanks Mom, even though I stomped my feet and called you a meeannie snot-nose) Mango was always one of my favorite fruit, and now we had trees decorated with them as if they were Christmas ornaments.  Juicy, orange-and-red, dangly ornaments.   I was a little monkey.  All knees and elbows, but a quick little shit.  I could tree myself in minutes, and was always hanging out in the branches of cacao trees and coconut trees and picking starfruit from the vines at the tops.    My little sister was just as bad...exploring in the woods and collecting shells on the beaches.    To facilitate mango-picking, (or any other kind of fruit, I guess), Tahitians devised a pole/dog-catcher loopy thing... A noose, of sorts, at the end of a long bamboo pole that you could snag a mango with.  Once around the stem, a quick tug would send the mango careening through the branches to the awaiting hands below.    My sister and I would spend afternoons collecting fruit, and were a pretty deft team, if I do say so myself.  (I do! Ha!)    One day after school, we went into the back yard and were noosing green mangoes-the hardest kind and wonderful to eat with chinese candy.  Sis had the noose and I was awaiting the mangoes below.  Snap-catch, snap-catch.    Then I saw the one that I wanted...the biggest, juiciest, highest mango I'd ever laid eyes on, hidden amongst the branches and the leaves.    "Sissy...can you get that one over there?"  "That one way up high?"   "Yep.  That's the one."  Sissy noosed it, gave it a good tug, and snapped the stem with an audible "CRACK!"  And sent it careening downwards.    I was waiting like an outfielder at the other end...hands cupped expertly...when the mango bounced off of a branch.    BONK!  "Oh no!!!"  I heard my sister cry through a fog.  I took a mango in the eye.  Bad.    She helped me back to the house and all I could see was red.  Red chair, red walls, red Mother's face.    After a lot of ice and asprin, I had the biggest shiner you'll ever see.  It stopped hurting by the next morning, and I was pretty proud of it by the time we got to school.  Kids love showing off their boo-boo's, and the bigger the better, the more gore the more glory.    Teacher didn't think so.    The school called my mother and sent someone home with me that day to make sure I wasn't being abused.  The only thing that they found out was that my mom had an excellently crafted but seldom used vocabulary of swear words that she saved for people that had the balls to question her parenting abilities.  The guidance counselor left my house in tears, and I got a new set of rollerblades!  Ahhh...justice.

      I had a wonderful weekend at the beach with friends.  We were in Panama City, which I had the pleasure to discover has aptly earned it's reputation as the "armpit of America".   There are many reasons for this. Panama City was THE place to go for spring break back in the 80's.  Nothing has changed since then.  The buildings and the restaurants, the clubs and the people all seem to be stuck in a neon-light-induced mullet fest that never ends.  All the stores are decked out with mannequins sporting black ray-bans and short bathing suit shorts in festive fluorescent colors.  Shot glasses with all the names under the sun lazored on them are at the door of every gas station.  Budweiser is the drink of choice, and many people funnel it on the beach if they aren't drinking it straight from the 'ol bottle.   What has changed is the quality of beachgoers that frequent this location.   The fattest, poorest, most foul-mouthed and hairy-backed, cellulite-ridden rednecks are the people who populate Panama City's beaches.  I'm sure this breed was there during the 80's, as much as they are now, but there is a much smaller yuppie-to-hick ratio these days, so they are all the more apparent.   There are two major clubs to go to in Panama City...Spinnaker and La Vela.  Both are enormous, consisting of over 10 actual "clubs" in each, both places full to the brim of country boys and 80's chicks, in ages ranging from 16 to their late 40's.   We didn't go out at all.  The beach alone was horrifying enough.
