      Yeah, it started off all rainy and horrible. Looks like it might be brightening up... but the day is getting worse. Problems manifesting with the car, as probably predicted. More stress, money, and also makes the looming Road Tax expiry more, erm, exciting? Do I really need to declare it SORN for like 2 days?? Who knows.  At work at the moment, and still very bored. No-one's buying anything... so remind me of the point of having 4 consultants in store today (oh, and only 3 chairs - guess who's without...).  Roll on Sunday!

      Yup, Big Brother 5 is here!!! And ok, I know it seems to be more peoople hating it as opposed to loving it, but it should prove a lot more interesting this year!

      *sigh* I'm sat at work, there's roadworks going on outside - so the doors are closed, and there's no customers what-so-ever. I've got a headache from the digging and the generator continuously whirring, and I'm bored. Very very bored.  We all are. There's 3 of us in, and none of us are needed. One just need a robot to do friggin' E-topups.  Anyone fancy saving 30% on their BT phone bill? Drop in and wake me up if you do.... (",)

      Oh bloody hell, he's gone and moved his blog AGAIN. Sorry, I get bored easily so thought a change might be refreshing!  So, what to talk about... Dunno! Work is very quiet at the moment. Guess it might be the sunshine - people out enjoying it rather than buying phones. Lucky them!!  Living in Derby is working out well. Liz and I getting on great and the place is brill. I've settled in really easily and it feels like home already. Though it has been 2 1/2 months so should be like home by now!  I'll fill you in more on life in a bit when I've got more interesting things to say. (",)

      Well, the party's been and gone.  Not many came in the end, think it was 8 in the end, from 20+ confirmed!  Seems like everyone has an excuse, which now leaves us with a lot of leftovers. Oh well.... More beer and food for me! :)
