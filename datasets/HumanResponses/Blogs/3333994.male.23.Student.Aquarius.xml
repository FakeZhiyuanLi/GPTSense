      This blog post is to deal with a problem that has recently came to my attention.  My mother is a supervisor at an eye doctor's office.  They service a lot of elderly people and she told that some of them have been responding other patient's name to get ahead of the waiting list.  A typical incident will involve an elderly patient who seems in a hurry or just doesn't want to wait to see the doctor.  When the next patient's name is called they will jump up and beat them to nurse who is calling them.  If the nurse does not know the individual by face then they will assume that the person who is responding to Joe Smith is in fact Joe Smith.  These patients do not realize that they may receive treatment for someone else's ailments.  They think that by cutting in line they will see the doctor first and he will know who they are.  This is not always true.  There have been cases of patients receiving unnecessary surgery or surgery on the wrong sight because they refuse to admit who they really are.  Since this has come to light the facility where my mother works has changed its policy.  They now require individuals to show id when they are called to see the doctor.  They also have to go through three identification checks before surgery is administered.  This seems to be redundant but when people act dishonestly simply to save time it is necessary.  I am shocked that people would answer to another's name and go along with the shame the entire visit.  Strange things happen in the health field but this was something I had never even thought about.  Any comments???

      This blog entry is for posing an interesting question.  "How can a facility weigh the ethical considerations of upgrading technology and replacing human workers with mechanic workers?"  This topic is of great interest to me because I believe in facilities maximizing their technology to better serve the public's as well as their own needs.  Technology can effectively replace many of the functions of human workers.  The dilemma is whether reducing human workers is better in terms of quality and efficiency.  In some cases, yes, a computer can do a more thorough job with less mistakes than a person.  The computer doesn't get tired and doesn't make mistakes.  This, on the surface, sounds great.  However, computers cannot make decisions for themselves.  They are only as good as the people that programmed and use them.  I for one believe that computers should be used by companies not to replace whole departments, such as billing or medical records, but to enhance the abilities of a few more highly trained individuals.  The goal should be streamlining.  This cannot be done without human interaction.  Technology should allow facilities to cut back on the number of support staff that they need.  This will demand a more highly trained and flexible staff.  However, the technology will reduce the amount of repetition and reduce wasted materials.  The benefits of technology are endless, however, humans will always need to be an integral part of the process no matter what it is.  Technology should be used as a tool not a crutch.  Marrying the idea of a technologically advanced health delivery facility with skilled and properly trained staff will solve this dilemma once and for all.  Any other opinions would be appreciated.

      Being the first entry I will simply state my reason for wanting to pursue the health administration field.  My goal is to become a consult to private practices and small hospitals.  I feel that there are vast improvements that can be made to increase efficiency in the workplace.  I feel that these healthcare entities will be the most responsive and eager to change.  I believe in using technology to streamline business.  I also believe in having an educated staff who now their job and the role that it has in the overall mission of the facility.  I feel that simple changes in equipment and training can be the best investment a facility can make.  I will continue to post new ideas about improving the structure and procedures in the healthcare field as well as some interesting problems that come up along the way.  Changes bring about ethical questions that can not always be answered quickly and easily.  The goal is to continue learning.

      The issue being discussed in this week's blog is the new breakthroughs in handheld technology.  PDAs are quickly becoming a healthcare worker's best friend.  When handheld devices are linked with the central computer of a facility using wireless technology they can transmit information between the two at incredible speeds.  This can be very useful in two main areas: patients' electronic medical records and disease information.  The technology has finally advanced enough to allow preloaded paperwork to be filled out through the handheld device.  This means that nurses will no longer have to write anything out when caring for the patient.  All of the information will be transferred automatically to the main database and added to the patient's record immediately.  These updated records will be useful in case of an emergency where another physician may need past injury or current medication information.  A simple request and the file could be encrypted and sent to the physician.  This could potentially save lives.  The second use for handhelds could be the identification of rare conditions or providing detailed information about medical issues to the patient.  Through the use of online databases such as Harvard College's, a facility can have access to almost the entire western knowledge about medicine.  If a patient is exhibiting strange symptoms, a simple query can help to isolate possible causes.  This could also help to eliminate excess diagnostics or procedures and help to lower misdiagnoses. This technology is not affordable for every facility however.  This can be a problem if two facilities wish to exchange information.  Another issue that needs to be addressed is the privacy issues concerned with the transmitting electronic medical records between networks.  I believe that the technology is ready and available and should be used.  Hopefully, in the near future, more facilities will see the need for improving their infrastructures and the community should benefit.  The potential is too great to ignore.

      This blog is dedicated to the issue of employee motivation.  Being that staffing is the number one cost healthcare facilities face, motivating employees to get the most out of their services is crucial.  A current trend in healthcare is the unmotivated worker.  Whether the worker is located in medical records or collections, the pattern is the same.  Workers are less motivated than in previous years.  What could be causing this? Laziness or a lack of incentives to work hard may be causing such occurrences.  A good way to slow such behaviors is to first look at the hiring and interview process.  I believe that many times, employers are looking only at experience or level of education as the deciding factors.  This is incomplete because it does not reflect how hard a person is willing to work.  More emphasis should be placed on a person's ability to address issues on their own and the ability to find work when no tasks are mandated.  Workers in a healthcare facility need to understand that just because business may be slow or all the assigned tasks for the day are completed, work does not stop.  They are still being paid and as such should find something useful to be doing.  This could include getting ahead on the next day's workload or assisting other workers with their tasks.  It is unacceptable for workers to simply waste time or to do nothing of value.  They expect to be paid for being at work and as such should expect to work for the entire allotted time.  More emphasis should also be placed on supervisors to ensure that employees know that they are to be working when they are on the clock.  No personal phone calls or entertainment should be tolerated.  Even if the employee cannot find anything useful they should at least look like they are working.  This can have a positive effect on the other employees around them.  Also, incentives or recognition for service should be given every week/month as a motivator for hard work.  Maybe this would be a gift certificate for dinner or a movie, anything to show appreciation for hard work.  Facilities need to maximize their workers outputs to lower costs.  This can only be accomplished with a team effort.  To continue ignoring this trend will mean more wasted time and less actual improvements made to the facility.  This cannot continue.  Any responses?

      A new piece of technology has recently come to my attention, automatic callers.  More and more patients are receiving a phone call reminding them of their appointment with a certain health facility a week before the scheduled time.  Although this seems like a small innovation the benefits can be tremendous.  These telephone systems are able to link patients with an operator if necessary.  This is important because if a patient has to reschedule their appointment they can connect with the operator and proceed with the change.  This should make appointment scheduling and confirming a much simpler task.  Also, only one operator is needed to at any one time.  A computerized voice will inform patients that their appointment is drawing near and if they have no concerns then they are free to hang up and the call is ended.  In the event they can't make the appointment or they have a question about something they can talk to a live person and get the service they need.  This should make patients feel better-served and the reminder should help to lower the number of no-shows that a facility has.  I am all for any technology that can make a facility a better or more efficient place.  This technology certainly has the ability to do both.  I expect a lot more facilities to adopt these type of automated callers in the near future.

      This blog is dedicated to the ethical dilemma that new technology brings with it.  My future as a consultant will depend on how well I can grasp the current technology as well as foresee new areas still to come.  I am a firm believer in using technology as an aid.  Advancements in the area of electronic medical records and the use of the internet to proscribe healthcare have ushered us into a new era of medicine.  This is a dangerous time as facilities scramble to compete with each other for having the newest and fastest technology possible.  Unfortunately, rules and regulations concerning new technologies cannot keep up with the pace of discovery.  This leaves voids that can potentially lead to breaches of confidentiality.  Electronic medical records promise a paperless and fully transferable form of medical record.  No more waiting to be faxed information from another facility or having to look for the record in an endless library of patients.  A few keystrokes and any pertinent information will be at the user's fingertips.  This has the potential to save lives and make healthcare more efficient.  However, protecting the records from unauthorized use has yet to be mastered.  In the case of using the internet to facilitate medical care, the same benefits are possible but the same concerns for security are present.  As technology continues to expand and new ways of storing, transferring, and retrieving patient information are invented, it is extremely important that healthcare entities think about their patients' rights rather than only focusing on the monetary benefits.  Any thoughts?

      The purpose of the preceding blogs have been to explore some of the issues that healthcare entities have to deal with everyday.  Some are challenges and some are human behaviors all, however, need attention to help promote a more efficient and better healthcare facility.  I have learned as I have written and have tried to explore the current mindset of this industry's workers to see which issues they feel are going to be important in the future.  Medical technology, electronic medical records, automatic dialers and staff motivation are the areas that I feel must be addressed in order to ensure that a company can meet the demands of its patients as well as move forward in terms of ability.  Through the use of better infrastructure systems, companies can be on the cutting edge of what medicine and healthcare has to offer.  This is important if a company wants to set itself apart from the competition and stay ahead of the curve.  In this time of shrinking reimbursements and talk of universal healthcare, the suggestions I have made do not always work financially for every entity.  However, the blueprint provided in these blogs is the ideal that companies should strive for.  I plan on consulting after I have enough experience in the field and will attempt to get the point across about the benefits of updating a facilities infrastructure to handle more complex tasks.  Once these improvements are made companies will begin to see the promise of new medical technology: A better and more healthy tomorrow.
