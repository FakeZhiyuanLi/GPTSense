						   In my family there are alot of cool people but the coolest family member for me is my cousin Clemente. He is the coolest because he is my age and I get to hang out with him since we both go to the same school. He is really cool with me because we treat each other like brothers. We even kind of look alike in some ways. I really trust him with everything and when we get together we go crazy.

						   Right now in my life everything is going good. I really don't want anything because I'm happy the way my life is right now. Although I'm happy as it is now I wouldn't mind having some things. One thing that could happen to me is to get a car. I really need a car because I'm always taking the bus to school and I'm tired of it. Another good thing is that I pass the AP World History test that I took like 3 weeks ago. If I pass it I won't have to take world history in college and that would save me time and money.

						   Right now there is a lot of confusion of what I want in my future. I'm still not sure on what I want to do. I have many things I want to do but right now but I haven't decided. My aspiration is to get a very good job and get a family and win good money to support them. Whatever I do chose to do I hope that I have great success.   Theoretically I see my self in the future as any type of engineer and hope fully for construction. Since I was little I was interested in construction because my dad would take me to his work sometimes. I liked the machines and it looked like a cool job. I have back up plans in case I don't become an engineer. One is to be a professional baseball player. That is my favorite sport and I enjoy playing it.   I am also kind of interested in joining the marines or navy. I want to fly airplanes because that's another thing I liked when I was little. Well right now I still have alot of options but Hopefully as time goes by I narrow down my choices and pick a good career.

						   Something I regret not doing is getting close to my dad. I regret not getting close to him at a young a age. Now is kind of hard getting close to him because I'm older and is harder for me to play around with him. I should of got close to him as a little kid. That's when I should of played around with him and go places with him too. Well I did play around with him when I was young but as I go older I kind of drifted away from him. As I got older I stopped playing with him as much and I also stopped going places with him.  Another reason why I'm not that close to him is because I mostly hanged around my mom. I was really close to my mom because she was the one that took care of me the most. Also my dad worked and my mom didn't, so that gave me a bigger chance to get close to my mom. Now I talk to him more but not the same way that I talk to my mom. I could talk to my mom about anything but not to my dad and I wish it wasn't that way.  If I could go back to my childhood I would talk to him more and let him more about my life. Now, I try my best to get close to him but I wish I had done it since I was young. This is one thing that I really regret not doing.

						    I'm going to talk about Mexico because I really like going over there. I go to Mexico only during the summer and on our Christmas break. Its cool going over there because I get to get away form everything that's going on here in Houston. For me is like a separate life over there. What ever I do in Mexico doesn't affect my life here, well at least that's what I think.   It gets cool because all my cousins go too. Man we get together and we go crazy. We hang out a lot and we go to a lot of parties and dances. Every time I go over there it helps me forget about my problems. When I'm over there I just worry of what's going on there. There are alot of thing to do over there. Sometimes we go hunting or we go to the waterfalls.   Well that's about it about going to Mexico. I don't do that many things because I'm over there for two weeks at the most. I'm only there for a while but I make it fun.

						   Hi my name is Abel. I was born on November 9, 1987 and right now I'm sixteen. I am 5" 8" have black hair and brown eyes. I am a very sweet guy with girls and I like to have fun. The things I like to do to have fun are to go out a lot. I really like going out to places with my homeboys because we have a lot of fun. We do a lot of crazy stuff and just have a great time. We like to go to the movies because we get to chill there. Sometimes we go to baseball games or other places like the mall. I hang out with my best friend, Hugo, and my cousin, Clemente. I met Hugo in 7th grade and since then we've been homeboys. Clemente, my cousin, used to live in the valley over there by Brownsville but his family moved over here two years ago and that made us very close.   Right now I do have a girl friend. Well actually we're kind of on a little break because we've been having problems. I met her on my freshman year and I really started liking her. She is very important to me because I really love her and because of all the things we have been through. We share a lot of good memories together. As for school I am doing pretty good. Last week we had and award ceremony and I got four certificates and two medals.   There a lot of things I like to do when I have free time. One thing that I really like doing is play video games. I'm not all into them, I just play when there's nothing to do or when I'm bored. I also enjoy hearing and burning music on my computer. I like sports a lot, so sometimes I play basketball with my friends. Over all I'm a very cool person and I like to have fun.
