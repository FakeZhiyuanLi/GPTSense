      Ok so today I went to the government center to get a county sticker for my 'New' old car. I took with me the county sticker from my  urlLink VW Beetle  that was stolen then totalled. So I get there and the lady behind the counter tells me that my county sticker is linked to a Chrysler not a VW.  Turns out I some how had a 2004 county sticker to my mom's Chrysler LeBaron (which was totalled in March of 2003) on my VW.  So, as she proceeded to tell me, I would have to pay the $25 fee for a new sticker instead of trading in my old one, unless I could supply her with the VIN # from the beetle.  Ofcourse I had none of the VW paperwork with me so I called my insurance company and got my VIN# and gave it to her.  Then she proceeded to tell me that I would still have to pay because the VW was out of the county.  When I questioned that she informed me that the computer showed I paid county taxes in 2002 and 2003, but that I was still not in county so I had to pay.  Andy questioned this further and she went back to talk to someone else. Finally she came back, told us she had no answer and no one knows what happened, but I would still have to pay because they decided they would just go ahead and give me the 2005 sticker and that is what I would be paying for.  Thinking this was finally settled and that I would not have to deal with them until 2006, I handed her my Visa.  The government center does not take Visa. . . I mean really who does not take Visa? Ofcourse I did not have my checkbook.  So I attemped to pay by cash. . . I only had $21 in my wallet. . .So Andy opened his.  $3. . . That brought us to $24. . .So I politely asked if there was an ATM on site. . There was, right around the corner.  So I went around the corner and the ATM was temp. out of service.  Fighting back tears of frustration, I headed back to the counter and informed Andy and the lady of my recent development. . . With the lady laughing at me Andy offered his checkbook, so after a quick run out to the car and $ 25 of my boyfriend's money I am now legal and have a county sticker.

      No not menopause. . . I am leaving the workforce to return to school full time.  This coming Tuesday I will be attending  urlLink Northern Virginia Community College  to become a respiratory therapist. Not sure what that is check this out  urlLink click here  or  urlLink click here . The only local community college with a theme song on the radio. . . It makes me so proud!  So between full time work and 2 partime jobs not to mention family, boyfriend, and friends, my life will be uber crazy, but hopefully in five semesters (two fall, two spring and the summer in between) I will be graduated and working as a respiratory therapist in New Mexico, or Hawaii, or somewhere different and fun like that.
