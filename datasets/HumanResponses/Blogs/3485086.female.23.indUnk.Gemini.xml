						   Maybe I just forget what it's like to vulnerable. Maybe I might wanna try again and see where it gets me.

						   So. yeah. I am fucking confused. I wanna go to chicago. now. not tomorrow. now. and you know what. I want to be a waitress for a while. Yes, someday I would like a graphic design job, but not anytime real soon. My self worth is not reliant on whether or not I have a career. Maybe I just want to have fun for awhile, I mean really. Waiting tables, I go, I pour coffee or beer or whatever liquid people really need to make it through their day. Maybe I just don't want to be stressed out for a day. Maybe I just want to live and be happy and not start my trip up to the glass ceiling, though I've heard the view is great. Maybe I don't think I have any talent. Maybe college was just a fluke. Maybe I knew how to kiss ass to the right professors and skated by with a good GPA. maybe I'm just meant to be a waitress. Who defines failure. If I keep listening to what my parents want I am going to fail. I am going to do nothing. I will be safe. Life will be easy and unfulfilling. I LIKE struggle. I like the just getting by aspect of life. It makes me appreciate things, sunny days. Maybe I think underneath it all, I am a supremist bitch. maybe I am selfish, elitist, proud. Maybe I like being mad. Maybe being just a waitress keeps all of those horrible personality traits at bay and if I am actually successful in a traditional way, I might wake up a soccer mom and not know how I got there. maybe I just like being an underdog. I like being weird and fun. Is there room for me in corporate America. I don't fuckin know. I don't want to find out right now. I don't know D. Maybe this is why people go to Europe after college, not to find themselves, but to figure out if they want to sell their souls to materialism and ambition or join the legions of college educated minimum wage workers out there and keep their dignity. That live life for life, not for work.  Fuck it all. fuck it.

						   So. I am deciding after 2 and one half weeks of smoking that it sucks. So I have smoked 8 cigarettes in the past 2 days. I stink. My throat hurts. And I am really not all that much happier. But. I have also decided that my life is much more dramatic with a cigarette in one hand. So from now on, I will only smoke when it is dramatic and not just when it is convenient. I know that my life will never be"figured out" if there really is such a thing, but in the mean time between moving and job hunting and being pissed at my dad, I need to have a cigarette every once in awhile. So I am weak.   At least I am not a crackhead.
