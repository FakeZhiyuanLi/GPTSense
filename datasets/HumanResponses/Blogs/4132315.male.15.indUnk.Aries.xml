      As I sat there in English class, I stared atthe girl next to me. She was my so called "bestfriend". I stared at her long, silky hair, andwished she was mine. But she didn't notice melike that, and I knew it. After class, shewalked up to me and asked me for the notes shehad missed the day before and handed them toher. She said "thanks" and gave me a kiss on thecheek. I wanted to tell her, I want her to knowthat I don't want to be just friends, I  love  herbut I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.11th gradeThe phone rang. On the other end, it was her.She was in tears, mumbling on and on about howher  love  had broke her heart. She asked me tocome over because she didn't want to be alone,so I did. As I sat next to her on the sofa, Istared at her soft eyes, wishing she was mine.After 2 hours, one Drew Barrymore movie, andthree bags of chips, she decided to go to sleep.She looked at me, said "thanks" and gave me akiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I wanther to know that I don't want to be justfriends, I  love  her but I'm just too shy, and Idon't know why.Senior yearThe day before prom she walked to my locker. "Mydate is sick" she said; he's not going to gowell, I didn't have a date, and in 7th grade, wemade a promise that if neither of us had dates,we would go together just as "best friends". Sowe did. Prom night, after everything was over, Iwas standing at her front door step! I stared ather as she smiled at me and stared at me withher crystal eyes. I want her to be mine, but sheisn't think of me like that, and I know it. Thenshe said "I had the best time, thanks!" and gaveme a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, Iwant her to know that I don't want to be justfriends, I  love  her but I'm just too shy, and Idon't know why.Graduation DayA day passed, then a week, then a month. BeforeI could blink, it was graduation day. I watchedas her perfect body floated like an angel up onstage to get her diploma. I wanted her to bemine, but she didn't noticeme like that, and I knew it. Before everyonewent home, she came to me in her smock and hat,and cried as I hugged her.Then she lifted her head from my shoulder andsaid, "you're my best friend, thanks" and gaveme a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, Iwant her to know that I don't want to be justfriends, I  love  her but I'm just too shy, and Idon't know why.A Few Years LaterNow I sit in the pews of the church. That girlis getting married now. I watched her say "I do"and drive off to her new life, married toanother man. I wanted her to be mine, but shedidn`t see me like that, and I knewit. But before she drove away, she came to meand said "you came!". Shesaid "thanks" and kissed me on the cheek. I wantto tell her, I wanther to know that I don't want to be justfriends, I  love  her but I'm just tooshy, and I don't know why.FuneralYears passed, I looked down at the coffin of agirl who used to be my "best friend".At the service, they read a diary entry she hadwrote in her high school years. This is what itread:"I stare at him wishing he was mine, but hedoesn't notice me like that,and I know it.I want to tell him,I want him to know that I don't want to be justfriends,I  love  himbut I'm just too shy,and I don't know why.I wish he would tell me he loved me!I wish I did too...I thought to my self, and I cried.I  Love  UI  Love  UI  Love  U..."

      When you are together with that special someone, you pretend to ignore that person. But when that special someone is not around, you might look around to find them. At that moment, you are inlove. Although there is someone else who always makes you laugh, your eyes and attention might go only to that special someone. Then, you are in love. Although that special someone was supposed to have called you long back, to let you know of their safe arrival, your phone is quiet. You are desperately waiting for the call! At that moment, you are in love. If you are much more excited for one short e-mail from that special someone than other many long e-mails, you are in love. When you find yourself as one who cannot erase all the messages in your answering machine because of one message from that special someone,you are in love. When you get a couple of  free  movie tickets, you would not hesitate to think of that special someone. Then, you are in love.You keep telling yourself, "that special someoneis just a friend", but you realize that you cannot avoid that person's special attraction. At that moment, you are in love. While you are reading this page, if someone appears inyour mind, then u are in  love  with that person... -nD-
