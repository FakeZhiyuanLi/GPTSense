      I'm not going to be here for a while. Things in my life are going...haywire for the most part. I determined that I don't stand so much of a chance with Casey for one thing...
  And for another my family life has just taken a tailspin. My parents have been fighting more and more lately(the reason I've not been staying home and been so eager to get out)...and yesterday my father(or in the words of Des 'sperm donor') threw our printer for my computer(the old one that I was supposed to get for the computer I've been saving for months to get)out the door and into the garden because my mom asked him to take it off the table after they'd been fighting. Things like this have been going on very frequently lately and I want to get away from it because I know why they're fighting; it's my fault. I failed algebra and my dad is so blindly furious for it. But he's taking it out on my mom instead of me. He yelled at her because I asked him if I could go to the movies with Casey on Saturday and when he said 'ask your mother' I told him I already had and she said it was OK with her but I had to ask him. He told her she had no right to give me permission to do things and shit like that. I thought I was going to kill him because he raised his fist against her. I swear to God if he'd hit her...I'd kill him. I've knocked him down before; and damn straight I'll do it again if need be. 

He can't scare me...nothing can anymore. I've naught to lose but my life and he wouldn't go to prison over me....

I'll post more when I can. I love you all so much.

      All right, well, I'm back. Technically I've been back since Sunday, I've just been kind of wandering around aimlessly between my house and my sister's place. I've seen Pirates of the Caribbean 4 times in the last 48 hours and I've got Jack Sparrow's odd phrases stuck stuck in my head, so if I randomly insert them in places in this post I'm sorry...no I'm not.~_^  

So yeah...I haven't really  done  anything of importance at all lately. I'm utterly bored. I was really looking forward to skating tomorrow night, but everyone pulled out, once again. Why is it my friends can only do stuff together when I can't? That's my luck though I spose. I think Casey's still going with me; if he isn't going my little sister and I will go. I'm so tired of staying home it's ridiculous.  

I miss my friends so much. It's crazy. I wanter summer to come so bad, just couldn't wait, and now a week in I'm ready to go back. I'm so...empty..and lonely..I constantly feel like I'm either on the edge of losing my mind or throwing up. No one wants to do everything; they're all too lazy or too busy to hang out with me. I mean, I understand in some cases..but not in others. Like, I can understand Lisa and Des wanting to hang out as much as possible and all, but not Casey. He didn't want to go skating at first because he said he'd rather sit at home and be lazy. That made me feel fantastic(heavy sarcasm)...and Laci got mad at me because I wasn't home this weekend and didn't go to her party because I was in Barnwell. Wtf? I'm sorry; my parents didn't want to take a three hour drive back here just so I could go over to her house for a couple hours. Then when I offered to hang out this weekend it wasn't good enough and she was all..*hiss*...*sigh*  

 ...looks like I'll be spending another summer the way I always do...  

...alone.

      Wahoo. It's lunchtime again and I'm still hanging out in the ROTC room wasting time as always....

We're watching Daddy Day Care, which is easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen ^_^ "excuse me, I need to see two little girls...because now I'm a big girl!"

Hmm. Our Bio exam was today. Pretty easy. I think I might try to stay here through third block today. *shrug* Who knows.

All right, that's it for now. I think. *shrug*

      Yeah well...my week hasn't been going quite that fantastically. I can't seem to get sleep at  all  for some reason. Hmm..

Tim asked me to 'reconsider my feelings'. *rolls eyes* It kind of pissed me off. Even though I know I told him I probably wouldn't come back..I dunno. I just...really don't want a relationship..at all. For some reason he refuses to accept that.

I mean, I just don't want to start something  this  close to summer. I  know  what I'll be doing this summer, I know my plans..and he's not in them, anywhere. (if you must know, it involves Lisa, Des, the state of Georgia, a backseat, whipped cream, strawberries, cake batter, handcuffs, and a whip ^_~)

The truth is, I  do  want a relationship..but not with him. Not right now. I want a relationship with Casey, but we don't always get what we want. Hell, I never do :-p But that's not the point. I mean...he was basically a rebound. That's it. I never meant for him to love me, and I never meant to love him either. But it happened...but my feelings faded inexplicably. His didn't. Unfortunately I can't change his feelings...but I also can't change mine. I guess I'm going to have to just deal with this in time..

 because that's all we have, really...time to occupy before we die.

      OK, yeah. It's lunchtime and I'm in the ROTC room (which is where I spend about 90% of my life O.o). Anyway...

I've had a lot of time to think lately..and that's not a good thing. I don't like thinking because it's a waste of time and usually ends up causing pain in one form or another. Whenever I start  thinking  I usually end up remembering things (i.e yesterday's blog). *sigh*...

I got like no sleep last night, it was kind of funny. I went to ed at 9:30 ish after reading parts of 'The Witching Hour' by Anne Rice. I woke up at around midnight and couldn't get back to sleep because I kept feeling like someone was watching me or there was someone/thing in my room (never a cool feeling). So I just kind of got up and went to my computer, otherwise known as BoB(or Beast of Burden) and stayed there for a couple hours before getting up and going wandering around the house(which is when I found the hand lotion stuff O.O long story)...then got to bed at 2:30 and woke up again at 3:11(yes, 3:11 O.o)...then stayed there till 6:00 when my mom came in and yelled at me. Go figure.

But yeah..the few times I did get sleep I had nightmares, which seems to be happening a lot lately. Not since I dated Stephen have I had nightmares like this, and I thought they were gone with him. Wtf. Oh well.

I'm gonna go...do something. I dunno what. Ooh, I get to go to ALGEBRA next block. I think I'm gonna throw up.

      I cleaned my room this morning, as in totally revamped it. It's...clean. Something I'm not used to. o.O

While I was cleaning I found some old letters from Stephen that I hadn't read in...wow, forever. It made me cry. Even though I'm over him and whatnot it still hurts sometimes. I guess you can't spend that much time with somebody and have it not hurt after they leave. It's kind of funny really...I dialed his number yesterday by accident. It's only two digits off from my sister's numer and I was calling her. I used to do that all the time, but he answered the phone..and I just froze completely. Hearing his voice brought back an omega flood of memories that I've kept locked away for months...it was so weird. Eventually I managed to apologize and say 'wrong number'...but i know he knows it was me 'cause he has caller id.

Kinda strange. I was going through the poems and stories I wrote a long time ago on my first xanga site and I found this thing I wrote...over a year ago. But it describes what I felt almost perfectly..and I wrote it as fiction then. O.o

  "Sometimes at night, when shadows seem darkest, and minutes pass like hours.....
when not a soul stirs and their minds are all occupied with dreams of possessions and physical desires...
long after all the lights have grown dim......
that's when you visit.
Not physically, you've been gone for too long for that. 
But i feel you....feel your arms around me...feel your breath on my skin, 
and your warm tender kisses....
i miss those feelings. 
You are my everything, long after you departed. 
why did you leave me? 
did i do something wrong? 
all those beautiful country nights...did they not affect you the way they did me? 
you probably do not think about me, i'm sure you're happy with her.
i certainly hope so. 
i just want you to know i am  not  over you, no matter how i act to your face, no matter what i say. 
you are in my soul. you are in my core. 
you are my heart. 
no matter where you go, no matter what happens, you will always have a place in my heart. 
nothing will take your place. 
until we meet again, my love, know that whether you want it or not, you will always have all of me..."  

Weird, right? Hmm...that's all I really have to say for now.

      Hmm. I kinda really like this Blogger thing. Maybe I can get on it in ROTC too. lol...

Today is still a day. I went to my sister's house and played the Xbox for four hours, then came home and watched Queen of the Damned...again. Lestat is a sexy beast.

I don't think I'm going to update my xanga all that much anymore...people are just too damn critical. After all, it's  my  journal, I can say what I want in it...right?

Well, only 4 more days of school. I'm really looking forward to summer, because it will be a welcome break from the ongoing, actionless, mindnumbing drama that is high school...but it also means two months with almost no contact with my friends. *shrug*

I feel like I'm losing my sanity. I don't want to hold on, I want to let go and slide into the abyss...but I can't. Grr.

That's it for now. I don't feel like typing anymore for now....OK, well, just one more thing. 

  beautiful oblivion
-eve 6

 I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rines
But the lack thereof
Would leave me empty inside 
Swallow my doubt
Turn it inside out
 Find nothin' but faith in nothing 
Wanna put my tender
Heart in a blender
Watch it spin round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendevous, then I'm through with you

 I've been burned like a wicker cabinet
Chalk white and oh so frail 
I see our time has gotten stale
 The tick tock of the clock is painful
All sane and logical 
I want to tear it off the wall
 I hear words in clips and phrases 
I think sick like ginger ale
My stomach turns and I exhale

I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rines
But the lack thereof
Would leave me empty inside
 I would swallow my doubt
Turn it inside out 
Find nothin' but faith in nothing
Wanna putmy tender
Heart in a blender
Watch it spin round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendevous, then I'm through with you

SoCal is where my mind states
But it's not my state of mind
I'm not as ugly sad as you
 Or am I origami?
Fold it up and just pretend
Demented as the motives in your head 

I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rines
But the lack thereof
Would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt
Turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothing
 Wanna put my tender
Heart in a blender
Watch it spin round to a beautiful oblivion 
Rendevous, then I'm through with you

 But I alone am the one you don't know
You need to keep for your ego 
Make me blind when your eyes close
Sink when you get close
Tie me to the bed post

I alone am the one you don't know
You need you don't you need me
 Make me blind when your eyes close
Tie me to the bedpost...

      So it's been a day. O.o I got online and Lisa sent me a link to this, knowing the addiction I have to webjournals(like about 90% of the world's population it seems o.O) and I started one myself. 

I think this one will be my 'private' journal for a while, unless I like this more than Xanga...which I already do ^_^

Gotta go for now, I'll post more later.

      Last night was pretty cool. I spent the night at Lisa's, had an awesome time...we went bowling with Heather, Rebecca, Des'ola, Rick and Bryan....Bryan is really awesome. ^_^ Anyway...at the bowling alley I kinda started feeling a little off, like...I didn't really  belong  there. I started sort of feeling like I was just crashing someone else's party. I spent most of the night hanging out with Rebecca and  Bryan...so I really can't complain *insert big cheesy grin here* I got to sit on his lap in Rhonda so woo....but that's a diff story.
 
I don't feel too wonderful so I'll leave you with some pretty song lyrics.

 standing on the edge of morning  
scent of sex and new found glory  
playing as she's pulling back her hair  
she drives away 
 she's feeling worthless 
used again but nothing's different  
she stayed the night  
but knows he doesn't care  

home by three  
deafening quiet  
the porch light's off  
yes they forgot it  
 she'd cry herself to sleep  
but she don't dare   
then she wants to be a model  
 she wants to hear she's beautiful   
she's beautiful   

i want to save you  
 i want to save you  
i need you  
save me too  
i want to save you   

dressed by dawn and out the door  
no light  
she memorized the floor  
so she could leave without being detected  
she works till three  
it's uniform  
she dreams that he'll come by the store  
she prays for days  
the boys mean she's protected  
 and she wants someone to see her   
she needs to hear she's beautiful  
she's beautiful   

 i want to save you   
i want to save you  
i need you  
save me too  
i want to save you  

and she won't sleep  
she won't sleep  
and she won't sleep  
at all  

 i want to save you  
i want to save you  
i need you  
save me too  
i want to save you  
(let me save you)  
i want to save you  
(let me save you)  
i want to save you  
(let me save you)  
i want to save you...    

jim made me listen to this song....*raises eyebrow* but it's really good

      Everyone knows about Danny..I won't repeat what happened. It has sent a shockwave through me...I feel so vulnerable for some reason. I mean...Danny was such a cool person. I care for him very much still. And knowing that he won't be back next year..that he did something like this..is just crazy. I know you all probably feel basically the same way...I've been crying on and off all day. I think it just really sank in this morning...because yesterday I kept myself busy with menial tasks and submerged myself in rpgs....I didn't have to face reality until this morning at the flea market when Calvin (a friend of my mother's) asked if I 'knew that pothead kid that killed his father'. I was...shocked, to say the least. It brought my little oasis in the midst of all this drama crashing to the ground. I mean....Danny may have been a 'pothead', and I may not have agreed to most of what he did...but I will stand by him; I will defend him from the ignorant people who didn't know him or anything about him. He was a good person, damn it...  

God, look at that. Talking in the past tense like he's..dead or something. *shakes head* I hate that....he  is  still....not was.  

Anyway, these recent happenings have drawn me inexplicably closer to God. I am still studying religions in my free time(Christianity, Wicca, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism,..etc) but...it's quite strange. When I found out about Danny from my mama...I got off the phone with her, dropped on my knees, and prayed. That's...very out-of-character for me as ya'll know. I prayed for probably about an hour..and I don't remember what I was saying or anything. I think the general gist of it was 'God forgive him'...It was quite strange...but Thursday I was so..calm, so at peace for some reason. I figured I was just in shock...but I wonder if maybe it was because of God.  

Lately I've been having a strange dream. In it...I have been on a journey of sorts and I come to a crossroads. I look down one path and it's bright and it's beautiful and it's radiant...the very sight of it makes my heart feel like it's about to burst inside me and I want so much to go that way but at the same time I know it isn't right because I've done nothing to be worthy of such beauty. The other path is dark and forbidding, dirty, and just...ugh. Words cannot describe. But I choose this path anyway because it's easier to accept and I feel more comfortable here than I did standing before the beauty and wonder of the other path.... 

I wonder if it's a spiritual dream or just the result of too much thinking....

opinions?

      I'm not very consistent with this journal thing, am I?   I just wanted to say hi and let you guys know I'm still breathing...sort of. I've been at my sister's house playing mindless video games for long periods of time. And I'm home for the next few days or so...because I don't want to go back right now. I've been running from myself for too long, I can't keep running. It's finally time to square off with these 'demons' from my past so to speak...   I haven't done anything important lately. I went to see Spiderman 2 opening night, it was one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Um...Last night I went to go see HP:POA for the 2nd time..and Josh let us in free ^_^ he's officially great.  That's about it. See ya'll soon hopefully...
