      Bar Review consists of a video taped lecture every day from 9am-12:30pm on one of the subjects covered on the NY Bar Exam. There are approximately 27 subjects that must be covered over 6 weeks of class and of course, with the bigger subjects, they often run into 2 or 3 days worth of lectures. And then it consists of going to the library and studying for 7 hours. Every day. All summer.   Ahhh, now we see the need for this blog. Creative outlet.  Uh oh, I forgot what it was I wanted to write about. Hmmm, maybe that was it. Maybe today's entry was meant to be short and sweet and I said what I wish I could yell at everyone who has either called me, visited me, emailed me, or text messaged me in the last 3 weeks wondering why it appears I have disappeared from the planet. For it seems, no one (at least no one not studying for the Bar Exam, which seems to be everyone) understands this time commitment.  Oh, also, I know this is in no way going to make up for how rude I was today, but SubwayGirl who was getting off the subway at Eglinton, I apologize for inadvertently hitting you with my umbrella as I tried to make the train. And here is a bit of advice: When you see someone running down the stairs at break neck speed saying "excuse me" loudly, and you hear the subway you just exited starting to close its doors, it might be a good idea to move out of the way so that people can make their train. Much obliged. and again, I apologize. Hitting your arm with my umbrella as I pushed you aside was a complete mistake.  "It's not about happiness or unhappiness. It is about doing what needs to be done"  --George Bernard Shaw  (that may be the exact quote, but it may not be. you get the gist of it though)

      If you're reading this, then you either somehow stumbled onto this entirely by accident, or I foolishly told you of its existence. I say "foolishly" because I am going positively batty studying for the New York Bar Exam this summer (all caps, so you know it's super important) and I think I am all studied out, it is humid as hell today AND I am currently listening to a song I liked last month and haven't heard in a while even though it is getting to be overplayed on the radio ("Float On" by Modest Mouse), and so, I am in some kind of a mood and felt the need to write it all down.   Oh yeah, and no one is online on msn or aol, so there is no one to talk to and nothing on TV. Ok, so, anyways, back to justifying the creation of this blog and my foolishly telling you about it -- so, yeah, I say "foolishly" cause I mean, this is nothing but random ramblings about nothing. Nothing of interest and really, a damn good way to waste some time, if you got the time to kill, and I clearly do not. So don't be sending me links to your blogs all of a sudden cause you all just want to be like me and start rambling and making you friends think you're crazy by letting them read about all of your stress-induced nonsense.   Are you STILL reading this? I just insulted you, and you're still reading this? Anyways, Welcome to my Blog. More to come, that is, if I don't forget I even did this. And don't look so shocked, I'm stressed out, remember? I am perfectly capable of thinking I dreamed this whole thing up...
