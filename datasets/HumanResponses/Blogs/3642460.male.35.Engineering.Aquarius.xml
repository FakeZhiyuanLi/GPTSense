       We get the new flooring this weekend... 1100sqft to cover with tile and laminate flooring. Now, I just have to learn how to tile...  I haven't figured out how to get the 40 boxes of laminate home yet.   I had a really good night at the Buddhist center on Wed. It was my first foundation class and was a but difficult because of the language used. I did manage to keep an open mind and was able to speak with the head Nun afterward who was very generous with her time and helped give me come clarification on the intent of specific words.   My wife helped me make a cheesecake-like desert last night for a potluck at work today. We have has some enjoyable time together lately and I'm looking forward to doing the flooring together. Lets see how I feel after the first room is done.  Worked out again yesterday. Its very handy having the new gym at work.  Meditated and stretched this morning after I wore up at 5:30am. It seems like I do really need less sleep when I mediatate.

       Father's day was very nice. My wife made me a delicious egg scramble with refried beans, black beans, and hashbrowns. I got some nice cards from the kids and a veryu nice card from my wife.   Finished selecting the flooring  Spent some time with my wife by the chiminea on Sun evening, had some time to talk which was nice.  Battled a huge headache all day yesterday and finally went to be when I got home. Felt better when by the time the kids were going to bed.   Dentist appt this morning... Dr. appt this afternoon... and a tonne of stuff to do at work.

       I still have not had a chance to get to the DMV which I would like to do to get my motorcycle on the road! I have a very nice VStar 1100 that I want to get back on the road.   We just got back from a party that was a little too stressful! I find it difficult to enjoy a party when people come and abandon their small children for everyone else to look after. Then, keeping your own small kids out of everything that they can break, or swallow while people expect you to carry on a conversation is especially enjoyable.  Prior to that several hours of that blissful relaxation I went shopping with my wife for new carpets, tile and laminate! I did however get to go to the gym prior to that which is why I am still sane enough to write this instead of drinking heavily.  I'm planning to attend a foundation class at the Buddhist Center with the intent to go regularly if the class is good.  Off to read for a while before giving in to the fatigue of the day. Maybe will try to mediatate to regain a happy mind. Right now it just feels like a tired mind.

       Today was a happy day. I woke up happy and had good patience with my son (2) who can be trying first thing in the morning. I helped my wife get ready for the gym and we managed to circumnavigate a disagreement before it blew up into something more than it was. All in all, a good start to the day.  Work went well, was productive and I even managed to fit in a workout at the end of the day. My chilli cheese fries at lunch were spectacular!   The kids were good when I came home and gave them a bath and got them ready for bed and I managed to make my evening meditation class on time. The class was good: a recap of the last month or so and some thoughts on emptiness and impermanence.  I had a few minutes to chat with my wife before she went to bed, and before writing this and heading off to bed myself. Its been a very enjoyable day.

       Some interesting thoughts from tonight's presentation.  1. All you need to be happy is to have a happy mind.  2. Three things if practiced sincerely will bring you happiness: giving, discipline, and patience. 3. All unhappiness arises from a feeling within.. we mistakenly look outward to attribute these feelings to external things. The feeling arises from our own attachments. 4. Patience is the acceptance of things as they are without expectation and the acceptance of their karmic nature.  I plan to check out the foundation classes next week. Its nice to finally be studying as part of a community (sangha) instead of solely from books by myself.

       I've been running Gentoo linux for about a year now and have finally settled on a workable workstation setup:  - openbox window manager - pypanel - openoffice - thunderbird - firefox - gaim - courier-imap  I also managed to get udev and xorg-x11 working.  I meant to put several important notes I discovered for setting up Gentoo to work nicely but I have forgotten most of them.  I did solve a problem with ssh after a recent upgrade. If run as non-root it would always call ssh-askpass which I do not have on my system. It turns out that you need to set /dev/tty to have 666 permissions instead of 660.  I compiled alsa into the kernel and it seems to work well that way.  If I remember the other tweaks I had to make I'll revise the post... likely bad blog faux-pas.

       Ben woke up in a miserable funk today. He seems to have a cold coming on. Jordan has been doing a great job entertaining him this morning and is being very helpful.  Monica is still sick with her mysterious Bronchitis-like wheeze but she is up today and tired, but feeling somewhat better.  I got a chance to meditate this morning which has hopefully helped my outlook for the day. Let's see how long I can keep the positive outlook.  Work has slowed over the last couple weeks and its been a nice break. I think it will start to pick up for the end of month deadline.  Henry and Heather went in to have their 2nd child this morning. I'll find out later today how it went and what they had.  All for now... time to go to work.

       The tile has won.  We will have to get someone else to finish the tile as it is just too time consuming to do with small children. It took about 12 hours to do the laundry room and about 5 hours to do the upstairs bathroom. I have gotten a cold though which I think started from my lungs and sinuses being aggravated by the grout powder.   The tile that we did finish came out very well. There is a slight eneven issue for the toilet but I think I can shim up one side.  We still have about 900sqft to do in laminate and we have to clear out the upstairs for carpet.    I am finally getting a much needed vacation so I may not post much over the next couple weeks.  Thursday I was feeing rather down. In buddhist terms I would say I had a negative mind. I was just tired Friday and had to push myself to finish my work.   Today I was able to sleep in a bit but we have so much cleanup to do I am getting worn down again.  I just want some down time to rest...

       After my wife's two hour estimation (yeah right!) for tiling the room... it took us 12 hours to complete and we haven't applied the grout to it yet!  Our experience tiling has been much like the saga of The three bears... the first mortar was too thin, the second mortar was much too thick, and finally the last mortar was just right!  The thick mortar was really hard to set the tiles in.  I did the room measurements, and laid out the tiles and cut the tile's using a wet saw (I couldn't imagine not having this saw!!) and my wife spread the mortar and set the tiles. The drain area was a real PITA.   Only 4 more area's to tile! Then we can start the laminate!  I need to find out how to prepare the floor in upstairs bathroom areas. Apparently we need some sort of water barrier on top of the backer board.  Hopefully we can get all the bathrooms ready for tiling tomorrow and start grouting the laundry room so we can have clean clothes again!

       I've been offline for a while due to a remodelling project.   My wife and I are redoing all the flooring in the house. Actually, we are having the carpet done but we are doing the laminate and the tile. We've removed the old carpet and vinyl, demolished the old tile and finished the backer-board in one bathroom.   That leaves:  - Backer-board in kids bathroom - Repair concrete from old tile removal - Remove vanity downstairs and put in pedastal sink - Tile in master bath, kids bath, entranceway, downstairs bath and laundry room - Grout all the tiled rooms - About 950sqft of laminate  I injured my knee in soccer about a month ago so I haven't been going to play, and my Buddhism classes are stopped for a while so I have a little more time than usual.  I could use the classes to de-stress a little right now... even time to go to the gym would be nice but its just too hectic right now.  I need a vacation! Luckily I have 2 weeks coming up.... whew!
