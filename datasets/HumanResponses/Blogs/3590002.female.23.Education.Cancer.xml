       Blogitis?  I started this blog partially because the Mississippi Teacher Corps thought they might decide to require it (but then they changed their mind and made it optional), but mostly because my college roommate M who lives in DC (www.MindCity.blogspot.com) started one and was starting to apply peer pressure. A few days after spelling my blog address for my mother she told me that she and my father both had started one each (www.AliSign.blogspot.com and www.mikeschuchs.blogspot.com). Who is next? Gran McLean? Shona? Granny Schuchs? Marianne?  Mrs. Ann? Ruth? Emma? Iain? Jared? Kati? Granpa McLean? Aunt Ruthie? James? Only time will tell where this dreaded disease strikes next. I am not sure who I would place my money on. I would be surprised if James does it. As much as likes reading mine (to see what I say about him) and looking at the Coffee House website (to see if Mum has posted any new pictures of him) he is pretty good at resisting peer pressure (if it involves writing).   Queen of Procrastination for Life  Tonight they are crowning the new Miss. Mississippi. She (who probably also went to Ole Miss and either majored in Education or Journalism) will get to keep her title and crown for one year, my title lasts for life and can never be revoked, even if my roots start to show! I am staring a 15-page paper (a reflective journal on my experience this summer as a student teacher) in the face. I know if doesn’t sound that bad since it is supposed to be based on my experiences, but since it is for a grade, that means there are right and wrong answers. So as self-appointed Queen of Procrastination for Life, I am sitting here writing a blog (that is no longer required for my program), drinking a sugar free mocha frappuccino, and listening to music (so I don’t feel like I am by myself). It is funny how even something as simple as a cup of coffee can make me miss Carrie so much. James is wiring up a pool for one of his bosses today. Today is the 2-year anniversary of our first date and so he is taking me out to eat tonight. It is amazing how much can change in just two years.  Withdrawal symptoms  This is the first weekend James and I have not made the trek to the Coffee House in almost a month (since Kati’s graduation). It feels funny not rushing off to anywhere. I sort of feel like I am on vacation (but then this 15 page paper bites me on the leg and reminds me I am not). I hope the jet ski, the fat cat, Bosco and the fish don’t miss us too much this weekend. I am looking forward to spending the 4th of July on the lake! I just hope the rain stops by then, I am starting to get paler than Mum! I can’t wait to see what the food nazi is going to cook! I like going home. It is one of the few places you can go where people cook for you and clean up after you, well besides a hotel, but you have to pay for that! Just kidding, I also miss seeing my parents, pets and collection of stuff ever so lovingly stacked in about 10 huge plastic boxes sitting in my bedroom.   Places to go, people to meet  Well as much fun as this has been I now have to go e-mail y’all the link so you can’t complain about how bad I am at keeping in touch! Then I have a list of other things I need to do (before starting on my homework). The coffee has finally kicked in so I might actually get it all done before my date tonight.

       Run Forest Run!  Okay! This is a new low for me—today I chased a kid down the hall to give him his rough copy, which I spent well over half an hour practically rewriting for him. The paper is the same one that I proofread for everyone else (the three-fourths that turned theirs in) yesterday, the one that is worth a test grade. He turned it in during first period, but after a quick glance at it I told him to come back after second period (he was only next door) on his way to the buses because it was obvious that his paper was going to take a lot of time to edit. I even told his second period teacher to please remind him to come see me after they dismissed class.  My class got out a few seconds earlier than the class next door, so I waited near their door. I heard the teacher remind the kid to come see me as the class was dismissed. I called the kids’ name as he walked past me, but he either ignored me or didn’t hear me. As I followed him down the hall occasionally calling his name, I heard other students turn to him and say, “Hey Richard, Mrs. Carr is talking to you.” I finally caught up to him when he stopped to wait for the buses (I was wearing heels—he wasn’t) and he acted embarrassed that I had stopped him. This kid asked me three or four times during first period if I was through editing his paper yet. Now, when I chase after him to give him something that I spent more than half and hour of my life on, he acts like I am putting him out.  I am not really sure what I am supposed to do when I give a kid every chance in the world and he doesn’t seem to want to take advantage of any of them!

      Should they stay or should they go... I am torn over the kids we are teaching in summer school. I want to help them all, but that is impossible, especially since some of them don't want help. Around a fourth of the kids seem to have real difficulty mastering the concepts we discuss. The other three-fourths are just lazy--they failed during the school year because they had too many absences or they did not do any of their homework assignments. The lazy kids I have little sympathy for, but the kids that try very hard but just can't seem to get it are the ones that really tug at my heartstrings. It is hard for me to identify with them, so I am not really sure how to relate to them. It has become obvious that repeating the material over and over does not work. I have tried explaining the objectives from as many different angles as I can but I am still not reaching everyone. When asked to identify the verb in a given sentence the kids will guess every single word (if you let them) rather than thinking about the question and analyzing the sentence. Today I had to grade their persuasive writing papers. It was possibly the most frustrating experience of my life. It actually gave me a headache. You know it's bad when you have more writing on a student's paper than they do! The kids knew this assignment, which they have been working on for two class periods (and are supposed to be working on at home) is worth the same as a test grade, yet only a little over half of them turned in the assignment today. It just seems like they don’t care! It will be interesting to see how many of them end up passing. I am pretty sure the teacher I am working with will pass more of them than she should. Apparently, a lot of their previous teachers passed them on when they really shouldn’t have. However, if a kid fails does that not mean that I have failed that kid in some way? I do not want to fail any of my kids (both meanings of fail as used in the previous sentence) but what do I do when they just don’t care. How can I make them care? Or even worse how can I tell when they are just pretending to care but then they don’t put any thought into their assignments or don’t do their homework.

       Never ever have I...  (all you Ole Miss grads know what I am talking about) I have never lived in an apartment before. Then again, I have never lived in the Delta before either. One of my biggest fears since finding out I was going to be placed in Cleveland was where James and I were going to live. James has a few more classes to take at Ole Miss in Oxford and he has a good job in Batesville, but Cleveland is about two hours away from Oxford and about an hour and a half away from Cleveland. It was hard to find a town that was appropriate distances and times away from work and school for both of us. I thought (for a nanosecond) about rooming with some of the other teacher corps members that will be teaching in Cleveland, and seeing James on weekends. However, I like seeing James everyday (duh! I married him!). So anyway, I have looked at rental property in four different towns, measured distances, timed times, and worried about where we could continue to live together (hence marriage-legal license to live together) but still not have to drive over and hour to work or school.   And the winner is....  Clarksdale is only about a 45-minute drive away from Cleveland and Batesville. It is around an hour and 15 minutes away from Oxford, but we don't have to go to classes as often (or as early) as we have to go to work. Everyone recommended to Country Club Apartments in Clarksdale. James and I settled on a two-bedroom townhouse type apartment. The complex has a decent pool and they are going to completely redo the inside of our apartment before we move in the last week of July. For those of you familiar with Oxford the townhouse is similar to One Anderson Place (the two floor townhouse things off of West Jackson Ave). So anyway, that is one less thing to worry about.  The self-proclaimed Queen (for life) of Procrastination has returned!  Tons of things to do and too tired to think. Teach class. Go to class. Do homework. Grade class work. Dream about being in class. Teach class. Go to class... you get the picture. I have to be at Oxford Middle School by 7:30 am, which means I have to leave my house (Water Valley, MS) at 7 am. We generally get done there by noon. I eat in my car on my way across town to my graduate school class that starts at one. We get out of class sometime between 3:30 and 5:00 pm. After class I try and workout if I am not exhausted, do any necessary grocery-shopping, bill paying, etc. Then I go home try and figure out what to eat (and what to feed James), attempt some cleaning, and then try to focus on my homework and reading assignments for class the next day while grading or preparing stuff for my mornings at Oxford Middle School. Here lately I have also been driving to my parents' every weekend to try and help out with the coffee house they started in memory of my sister (www.cchouse.us). This weekend James and I are planning on staying in Oxford so that we can relax a little bit (driving so much is very draining). I am really enjoying all of my classes, but I am definitely looking forward to a weekend off.

       It's my Mississippi!  I was born July, 12 1981 at Jefferson Davis Memorial Hospital in Natchez, Mississippi. My mother is originaly from Scotland (hence my unusual first name) and my father was born and raised in Mississippi (some of his ancestors founded Mississippi). When I was in 8th grade my family moved to Fulton, MS in the northeast part of the state. Four and half years later I started my first semester as a freshman at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. I met my husband James in June of 2002 in Oxford, MS (he is from Water Valley, MS) and we were married in Natchez on March 8th, 2003. This summer I will move to the infamous Mississippi Delta to teach at a critical need school through the Mississippi Teacher Corps program. I have been placed at Eastwood Junior High in Cleveland, Mississippi. This summer I am student teaching at Oxford Middle School with Ms. Barnes's 7th and 8th grade summer school class. I am also taking classes towards my masters degree.   me An englandish taechr?  So, Friday I went and visited the school I will teach at this Fall. It is open plan! The school recently had short partition type walls put up to give a little bit more of a distinction between classrooms, and to give the teachers a little more privacy. However, the principal warned me that noise is still an issue. Yeah! I am not only supposed to keep control of my students, but I am also supposed to conduct my classes using my "library voice". Speaking of libraries, the principal would not let me see theirs, but told me it is very small. On a happier note, the principal was pleased to hear I had journalism experience. It seems she is interested in starting a school newspaper (it is a junior high school: 7th and 8th grades). No one knows whether I will teach 7th grade English or 8th grade English. Not that is matters right now because I can't pick my books up until July--they are otherwise in use right now. I am a little bit scared about teaching 7th or 8th grade English. I would feel more competent teaching Social Studies at any grade level or higher level English. I like literature a lot more than I like grammar. After so many years of trying to fine tune my journalistic English skills (English according to the Associated Press handbook) I have purposely erased all my understanding of traditional English grammar. Now, I am working on relearning it so that I can teach it correctly... ...lets hope I don't ruin their lives (and their understanding of basic English grammar).  James and Isla sitting in a tree...  Don't worry their is no baby carriage announcement coming anytime soon. No, we are just moving--once again! I still haven't unpacked everything from when we moved last June. It looks like we might be moving to Clarksdale or Marks or someplace like that. I am now an employee of the Cleveland School District, but my husband is employeed in Batesville, Mississippi. We both are students at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. I am a graduate student working on a Masters in Arts and Education through the Mississippi Teacher Corps program. My husband, James, has a few hours left toward his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. He will graduate May 2005, I will graduate May 2006, and then what? Who knows? Only time will tell.

      Today was the last day I had to teach in front of the TEAM. The TEAM is comprised of five master teachers. My whole class was broken up into five groups of five or six students. For six days we taught lessons (from a six day lesson plan that we wrote) in front of our mock class (the four or five peers in our group) while one of the TEAM teachers evaluates us. Since there are five TEAM teachers and six days each group teaches in front of one TEAM teachers twice (on the first day and the last day--she is supposed to measure our improvement). I was lucky because my group only had five students so we got done a little earlier than most. I was really nervous about teaching American English Grammar because two of the five TC (Teacher Corps) people in my group have taught English before and my degree is journalism not English. I have practically been relearning American English Grammar to make sure that I can teach it properly. All in all I am pleased with my performance over the six days. It was sort of a strange set up because it was like being in high school or junior high all over again, except that I had to be a teacher for one of the five periods. We rotated teaching positions so I taught first, second, fourth-twice, and last-twice. Every day I had a 9th grade Biology I class, a 7th grade Pre-Algebra class, a German I class, and a senior English class. Then somewhere in the mix I would teach a 7th grade Language Arts lesson. It was strange playing a junior high or high school student one minute and then playing a college educated teacher the next. I was very nervous teaching in front of my peers and the TEAM teacher on the first day, but the fear gradually disappeared and today I wasn't nervous at all. However, all of the preparation was very time consuming and every afternoon I came home exhausted. Now that I have settled into a sort of routine and I am not getting worn out by the schedule we are through with this segment of the TC program. That seems to be the way things go this summer--just when I get used to something it is over and it is time for another change. Luckily, I only have one more assignment to turn in and I am not even going to worry about it anymore until tomorrow night. I am going to take a night and enjoy not having anything to work on for tomorrow. Even though I prepared all weekend for this week (so I wouldn't have to do anything on my birthday but enjoy it) my lesson on Monday (my birthday) went worse (not bad but just not as good as the others) than the three lessons before them. This really scared me because I expected that my lessons would always just get better. So I spent the rest of my birthday fine-tuning my last two lessons so that the same thing wouldn't happen again. So I am going to just revel in the moment of having nothing to worry about for one whole night. Tomorrow I have to go meet with the TEAM and learn my overall grade thus far (in their class). But that is tomorrow and tomorrow is another day, for now I will enjoy tonight!

      Jameses don't come with instruction booklets, but I still don't know how I didn't think of it sooner. Going to the grocery store every three days is not only time consuming and expensive but also tiring.  However, so far I have not been able to figure out another way to keep enough food in the house to feed my James. SAMS!(sort of like Costco for you Brits) Why am I just now thinking of this? James and I joined Sams' Club on Sunday, and went grocery shopping. I bought huge boxes of James food (frozen corn dogs, frozen sausage egg and cheese biscuits, and lots of ketchup). It all fit nicely in our freezer and it was a lot cheaper than buying the same amount of food over a one or two week period. Thanks to Mum for offering to get me a Sam's Club Membership Card. I know it may sound sort of silly, but one serious concern I have about having children is that they might all have their father's metabolism (APPETITE). I have a hard enough time planning and preparing James' meals (when I cook there are usually no left overs) I don't know how I could possibly plan and/or prepare for two, three or four Jameses (especially when they are growing). Now, that I have rediscovered Sam's I am not so worried about it. Anyway I only have one James to worry about feeding now, so I have plenty of time to build that industrial sized kitchen.

      Today is my birthday, but don’t worry you’re off the hook because I celebrated it yesterday. For the record, I am now 23. Some of you have suggested that I am older or younger so I am setting the record straight. I had a lot of gun yesterday. James and I met my parents in Tupelo and ate at Vanelli’s. We then went to the Tupelo Flea Market to see all the stuff (I mainly like looking at all the animals) and kill time before the Buffalo Park opened. They had a lion, a tiger and a bear at the Buffalo Park (plus a lot of monkeys, snakes, goats, deer, a pair of giraffes, a pair of ostriches, some emus, some camels, two alligators, a skunk, birds, lizards, a ferret, donkeys, horses, etc… Oh! and lots of Buffalo (a white one named Dakota).  We went on a tour of the park on a “bus” pulled by a tractor. Our guide seemed neither knowledgeable of the American English language and how we use it or the animals he was showing us. He kept talking about how bad his knees were and his last knee surgery, etc. It was kind of funny, I am still not sure if he was one of the attractions or not. One of the monkeys was watching Nascar in its cage (it had a little black and white TV/Radio). I think they both probably have a lot in common, except maybe the monkey had a better command of the American English language. Why bother going to the Delta to teach English, perhaps I will just go to the Buffalo Park, at least there you get free drink refills!  Where credit is due.  Thanks to Mum and Daddy for taking us to lunch, the flea market and the Buffalo Park. We had a lot of fun and I am already enjoying my new printer/scanner/copier! Thanks to Gran and Granpa for the lovely card and the call right after midnight (their time, a little after 6 pm our time) to be the first to wish me a happy birthday (it was July 12th over there). Thanks to Meredith for the funny (ha ha) card and the phone call on my birthday! Last but definitely not least—James picked out a wonderful card and a really cool vanity table and mirror and he put a lot of thought into what style of furniture I like, what would match my decorating style, etc. I am still picking myself off the floor. All in all I feel very special, so thanks to the people who remembered my birthday this year and made it special for me.

       A week in review.  It was the shortest of weeks and the longest of weeks. Although James and I had Monday off, James had to be at work at 6 AM instead of 7 AM (those silly engineers, they decided to give the rest of the plant the week off so they could go in early and fix things all by themselves). That meant that Isla and James had to get up at 4:15 AM instead of 5:15 AM all four days this week. Since I didn’t have to be anywhere until 9 AM I wussed out on Friday and slept in while James made his own breakfast (half a box of fruity pebbles).   The Battle of Lake Itawamba Or Redneck Adventures Or DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME  We all had a lot of fun over the Fourth of July Holiday weekend. Last Fourth of July, Daddy and James got in trouble for making their own fireworks—acetylene and plastic bottles. This year they just shot bottle rockets at Scotty (Nichols), Zach (Rhyne) and Jamie (Graham) as they rode by on jet skis. To make it fair Daddy later rode over to the Nichols’ end of the lake to let them shoot at him with bottle rockets (Mama told him it was only fair). Scotty, Zach and Jamie didn’t do nearly as good of a job shooting bottle rockets as Daddy and James. Daddy and James had their bottle rockets loaded into pieces of pipe and were using torches to like them (for maximum turn around and reloading time). And yet Daddy wonders why the national security people always pick on him at airports? The next day we all went swimming in front of the house. Mama requested waves and so Daddy got on the jet ski and made some really nice, big waves for us. Then James and Daddy decided to try to pull the canoe behind the jet ski to see what would happen. James decided that his kneeboard is not only more fun, but definitely safer (I am inclined to agree). We had a lot of fun at the coffee house as usual. Galvin is planning on attending Delta State this Fall (he is transferring from ICC) so he will be in Cleveland with me! We also rescued another Blue Jay. As those of you who have known me for a length of time may remember, Carrie and I rescued a Blue Jay from the road in front of our house the summer after I graduated IAHS (Itawamba Agricultural High School). Because I am taking classes and teaching this summer I don’t really have time to feed the baby bird every two hours, so Mama and Daddy are taking care of it. It should be flying soon; it is a lot older and healthier than the one I raised. This one already has all of its feathers except for its tail and crest feathers (they hatch naked). They took him to the Coffee House and from the pictures it looked like he enjoyed it!  The third time’s the charm!  I made my second visit to my school last Friday and made a third visit yesterday. They are pretty sure that I most likely will be teaching 7th grade Language Arts. They showed me my room, which does not have a door, and informed me that they don’t use books to teach 7th grade Language Arts. It turns out that I will only have 70 kids (at the most). However, I will teach all 70 of them every day for 90 minutes! Their school day is divided into 8 periods. At 7:50 every morning every body participates in Reading Renaissance, which lasts until 8:35. Then there are eight-45-minute periods. Language Arts and Math are what they call blocked classes, which means the Math and Language Arts teachers get to teach for two periods straight through. This means I could have my first period class for 135 minutes (45 minute Reading Renaissance plus 90 minute class)! I have one 45-minute individual planning period and one 45-minute team planning period. I am on a team with a math teacher, a science teacher and a social studies teacher. We all teach the same 70 students. The team-planning period occurs when the children are either at PE/Band or Career Discovery and is when we meet with parents or plan interdisciplinary units for our 70 students. If any of this sounds confusing it is because it is!

      I don’t like being alone. I guess I have never really been alone before. When I was little Mum was always around and Carrie was only 18 months younger than me—so I don’t remember her not being there. When we moved to Fulton, I felt lonely at first, but Carrie and I just became closer and then eventually I made new friends—but Carrie was always my best friend. When I left for college that was the hardest part—leaving Carrie. I wasn’t scared of leaving Fulton, I had already moved once; I knew I could find more friends. Enter Meredith, Kelley, Marshall, Corey, Zach, Anna, Gordon, and a host of others. In college I was rarely lonely! There was always someone new to meet. Then Carrie came to college with me and I thought life couldn’t possible get better. Most of my friends all lived in the same house with me—officially just Miranda, Meredith and Carrie (plus an unofficial Kelley). People were always dropping in to visit us (Marshall and friends). We baked cookies and drank tea (just ask Meredith). Then just when I thought life couldn’t get any better, I met James. James and I have been best friends even before Carrie died, but he never would and never will replace her. In the past year I have been alone a lot. When you loose someone I think you need a lot of time to yourself and perhaps other people where just afraid to approach me. Now, I am constantly around people again and it is really comforting. I have missed being around people. I am not reclusive by nature. Sometimes I think the only times I am by myself now are when I am driving. I guess that is why I just burst into tears every other time I am alone in my car. I don’t like crying in front of people but there is a sense of anonymity about high way driving and crying. You probably don’t know the other drivers and they probably don’t know you. When I am by myself for more than 20-30 minutes I start feeling lonely. The loneliness reminds me that Carrie is gone and she is never coming back. I miss her so much all the time. But at those moments it seems unbearable and I just start crying. I was in the teachers’ lounge at Lafayette HS on Thursday making copies during lunch and this other teacher who was there for some Technology Discovery seminar asks me about my degrees—did I go to Ole Miss and who did I have as professors. It turned out that she and I had a professor in common. She then just randomly starts talking about how she lost her father during her last semester of college and she went on to say that she actually lost him fathers’ day weekend (the same weekend we lost Carrie). She then volunteered that she had decided to write about it and get it published. She said that it really helped her. It was strange because even though I hadn’t told her anything about my loss she was sitting there giving me suggestions about how to deal with my loss. We didn’t even exchange names! I thanked her, briefly explained my difficulties in dealing with loosing Carrie and she was very helpful and empathetic. All in all it was a very strange conversation, but it is probably why I am writing about driving and crying…

      So far so good. Evy and I were both surprised that at the end of the second day (Friday) we both felt remarkably unscathed. It is not that I have not had problems--Friday I was shoved by a 16 year old seventh grader that challenged me and then came in my class after me. I was surprised how well I handled it. Their behavior doesn't bother me. In fact it just makes me more determined not to let them get the upper hand. I have seen bad kids, these kids are not bad (yet), but they want me to believe they are bad. I know they aren't bad so I have the upper hand. My students are sufficiently scared of me and that doesn't bother me either. A few of the girls (the smart ones) seem to respect the way I handle the other students and a few of the (little) boys keep trying to come to my class even when they are not scheduled to. It is nice to know that even though I am feared I am not hated by everyone (yet). I was telling James how surprised I was at my ability to be mean (but fair) and feel no remorse. He laughed and said that I shouldn't take it the wrong way but I can be really mean when I want to. At first I wasn't really sure how to take that, but he assures me that it was a compliment. I have actually left both days of school so far with a huge smile on my face. I like all of my students even the bad ones and everything seems to be going great. Everybody talked about how horrible the first day would be and it wasn't bad at all. The fact that everything has gone so well is scary. Now I find myself looking over my shoulder and waiting for the proverbial other shoe to drop. The most frustrating thing about teaching so far is the administration not the students. To be continued I am sure! My family. Because James and I are a family we went to family day for his company on Saturday. They held it at Liberty Land in Memphis. It was a lot of fun. James is perhaps the luckiest person that I know so I knew he would win a door prize. Since I tend to have bad luck I promised not to touch his ticket and he won as I predicted. After we left Liberty Land we went shopping. That was probably a lot more fun for me than for James but he didn't seem to mind to badly. I made sure we alternated stores of interest so he wouldn't get bored. Today we went swimming. We had the whole pool to ourselves which was nice. Then we grilled hamburgers. All day we have relaxed, worked on unpacking and I have been working on stuff for my classes. It has been a great week and I am actually looking forward to my classes this week!

      Well so much has happened since I last blogged (that sounds disgusting doesn’t it). Today was the first day of school for my students and…  …I am still alive. I started moving stuff from our house in Water Valley to our town house in Clarksdale last Thursday (July 29) and we moved our last box into the house this past Monday (Aug. 2). I had to report to my school district on July 29th for new teacher orientation and in service (I even had to go on Saturday). My last day of Teacher Corps (TC) summer classes was July 23 where I found out that the TC person I had grown closest to during the summer had quit the program. I also discovered that another person I did not so well was going to be teaching the same class as I am at the same school as I am (She was previously assigned to one of the high schools in the same town as me—Cleveland—and I was the only TC person that was going to be at my school). Since then she and I have bonded and it has definitely turned out to be a good thing as Martha Stuart would say. I also painted almost every single piece of furniture James and I own. So as you can see I have been really busy over the last two weeks, but in order to paint an accurate picture of what I have been going through I am going to write about each event as if it is the day that it actually happened.   The First Day of School  Despite all of my fears and frustration today went a million times better than I could have ever hoped for. While I still have 32 students in the period right after lunch (and it is a learning strategies class which means they are slow learners or have failed for behavior problems), I did not kill them and I think everything went okay. I left the school at four thirty feeling a lot more confident in my ability as a teacher and with lots of ideas of what to do different tomorrow. I know that the students tend to behave better during those first few days, sort of a honeymoon period before they show their true colors. I have been laying down the law, but it is hard because my school has so many stupid (contradictory and misspelled) rules. Despite my many requests the school saw fit not to give us a copy of the student handbook until the day before school started and we did not receive our class rolls until 3:30 the day before school started. Not that that really matters because the schedules are all messed up and will be changed over the weekend. Until then I have been ordered to teach rule and nothing but rules. I was told that our school was trying to reduce its student teacher ratio and so I should expect between 12 and 20 students per class. In fact twenty-five desks were crammed in my tiny little room and I had discussed the possibility of removing some of them to give me more room. So at 3:30 pm the day before school they decide to tell me that I will have one class that has 32 students in it (that is the legal limit and I am the only one that has that many at a time during any period in my school). Not only to I have to find seven desks but find a way to cram them in my room. As a result Evy and I stayed well after the other teachers trying to get things ready. I was not issued a teacher handbook or a bell schedule (we don’t have bells so I have to know what time to dismiss them) until today during the middle of the morning! Out of everyone at our school I feel that only about 4 people have tried to help me in any way shape or form—that is a little frustrating. But tomorrow is another day!   A cheesy poem I wrote in my head while driving home after spending around 12 hours at school preparing for the next day…   'Twas the Night Before School Starts And all through the school Only two teachers were present Busy writing our rules  We belong to the Teacher Corps Because we believe Delta students deserve more Than they currently receive  You want to teach where? Our friends and family implore Do you know what you’re getting into? Are you really sure?  Where are all the others The state pays to teach? At home in their beds? Or still at the beach?  Do they not care about the students? Do they not like their career? Why are they all so bitter, Negative and without cheer?  Our principal doesn’t like us But not ‘cause she’s a snob Last year her TC math teacher Quit just two days into the job  So right from the start We have a lot to prove To our principal and students And ourselves too   It is all for the children We constantly say And hope that will help us Survive the first day!    The Frustration Mounts  All summer I have wondered why teachers have such a high drop out rate, now I know. Although my students have not arrived in my room yet I do not think that any of them could possibly be as frustrating as other teachers. A few observations: 1. Teachers/Administrators talk a lot of talk but don’t do a lot of walking if you know what I mean. 2. If the education system was run like a business than most of those involved would be fired. 3. We don’t just have teacher shortage problem, we have a severe good teacher shortage. I am surprised by the amount of teachers at my school who can’t speak proper English and show signs of a poor/mislead education. 4. Teachers like to complain (what am I doing now?). 5. Don’t ask your administrators questions. 6. As a first year teacher you are supposed to know everything but you will not be told any of it even if you ask multiple people multiple times. 7. Anything and everything you are told by anyone is subject to change at anytime! 8. Don’t trust anyone! 9. If I were to run my classroom and/or treat my students the way that I have been treated by my administration they would fire me in a heartbeat. 10. It is impossible for teachers to get along. Most teachers are women. This actually adds fuel to my theory about weddings—when you involve more than one female in anything you are asking for trouble. Men get along with other men. Women get along pretty well with just men (even if it is a love to hate relationship) but women do not like, will not help, and do not work well with other women. 11. In staff development meetings all they do is tell you what not to do (in negative ‘do not’ form) then they send you to your classroom where you have to be sure to post your class rules in the positive---Remain in your seat vs. Do not get out of your seat. “Oh, the irony!”, as Evy said during one of our countless staff development meetings which never start on time, in which you learn absolutely nothing useful and get chewed out for asking questions such as “can we have a hand book” or “when do we receive class rolls” if we were lucky enough that they actually attempted to answer our questions nine out of ten times their answer would be wrong (and we would later be scolded for acting on the wrong information).   BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH  I am sick of new teacher orientations, school district orientations, school specific orientations—I could live a very long and happy life without ever attending another orientation (or moving again for that matter). All of the orientations just sort of morph together in my mind after awhile and no matter how interesting they try and make it I have already heard it at some point and time earlier this summer. I had never heard of Harry Wong or Madeline Hunter before this summer but I have been so submerged in the almost cult like attachment that administrators seem to have for them that I think I could write their next books for them.   Our Welcome Party has Arrived  James heard that mosquitoes in Clarksdale were bad but when I got in my car this morning to go to work there were a swarm of mosquitoes waiting on me in my car. I think they must have gotten in while we unpacked. Also when I woke up this morning I had mosquito bites on my neck, arms, foot and even one on my nose (pretty much anything that was not under the covers) so I am guessing some got in the house as well.   Paint it Black  Where are the Rolling Stones when you need them? Probably on some farewell tour somewhere for the fifth or sixth hundredth time. James and I spent four straight days painting most of our furniture black. One day I painted for 11 hours with only about two 25-minute breaks all day. All the hard work was definitely worth it as it really tied in the rest of furniture and looks really good. It was all inspired by my birthday present from James and I will be sure to take pictures once we get everything set up at our new house.   Decisions  Perhaps the only person I feel that I have really connected with this whole summer just quit the program. I am being selfish in missing her because I know that she did what was best for her. I am not mad at her for quitting and I do not really understand the people who are. In the infamous words of Forest Gump, “That’s all I have to say about that.”   Teacher Corps in Review  I am leaving my summer school program and my classmates and embarking into the unknown. I feel scared and all alone. I am not sure how adequate my training has been this summer. For this to be a graduate program so far the classes have been a piece of cake. I have a 4.0 on my first 9 hours in grad school. I didn’t do that good my first semester in college (of course I was taking 21 hours and in an honor program but still I somehow imagined a masters program would be a lot harder than any of that). I think the most helpful experience will probably be the student teaching experience at Oxford Middle School. The least helpful experience will probably be the TEAM experience although the workshop week rivals as a close second. My favorite thing all summer was when Reggie Barnes came and talked to us.  A few months from now I might feel differently but for now, that is where I stand!   I Fought the TEAM and the TEAM won.  I feel like I deserve a t-shirt or something. I hate hypocrisy (although I realize we all do it from time to time). If you are going to tell all of us to speak correct English at all times, you should too (this summer we were taught this is called modeling behavior for your students). If you take off points you should explain why and/or if a student makes a mistake you should correct it as soon as possible instead of allowing them to continually make the same mistake and then failing them for it (at least in theory). You should always be consistent especially when grading (I guess unless you are grading other teachers—then apparently it is okay). I think teachers should stop and listen to themselves once and awhile and make sure they practice what they preach!
