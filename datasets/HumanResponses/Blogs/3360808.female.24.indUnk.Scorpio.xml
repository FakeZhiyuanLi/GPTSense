      Well, if Ellie had time to update, I should as well.  I want her to tell me when we are going to DC.  I miss everyone so much, and I want to go, but I can’t afford to go more than once, if I am going to pull off what I want to do this fall.  I need to make some money, like pronto!  The only thing is, if I am traveling, it is hard to waitress, because they want someone steady.  I am going to go to Texas with my mom and my brother this week, and then I will try to figure out what I am going to do.  Another option I came up with is SAT tutoring for high-schoolers in the area.  My car is out of the shop.  I didn’t realize how much chauffeuring I did with my friends till my car was out of commission and we had to try to do things with Daniel’s two-seater hot rod.  It was impossible sometimes.  I had to do a diagnostic to figure out what was wrong ($75), replace some bullshit coil ($300), realign the tires ($89), and get new break pads for the back ($89).  I swear, I am going to convince my parents to sell this VW lemon and get a nice, cheap, good gas mileage, never-breaks-down Japanese-mobile.    So, last night we saw The Day After Tomorrow, the movie where an ice age starts.  It was cool.  Barely any plot, but the effects were awesome.    Okay, I am going to go outside and enjoy the Iowa weather (62 degrees! where is summer?) and get some walking and running in.  Ellie’s blog motivated me to drink some more water, although I really have no concept what 3 liters is.  Well, actually, as I am on the net, I can always look it up, right?  Okay, 3 liters = 12.7 cups, .8 gallons, .65 British gallons (there is a difference??), 102 oz, and most importantly, 202.9 tablespoons.  See, you all learned something today!!  Actually (Actually . . . I’m English), this idea of British gallons intrigues me, so I am going to give you all another lesson. 1 US gallon = .8 British Gallons 1 US fluid ounce = 1.1 British fluid ounces 1 US liquid pint = .8 British liquid pint  This is very strange to me.  I never knew this until right now.  I think I am going to think about this while I walk.

      My mother and I had a talk yesterday about my loosing jewelry.  I told her that since I lost things, I would never want an expensive engagement ring.  Loosing an engagement ring is devastating enough, without the added weight of me loosing Daniel's savings.  Just to prove my point:  Last night we went to The Vine in Coralville. It was really really crowded, with a line of about 20 people at the door. Daniel and I scanned the restaurant looking for Luong and Mike, whom we were meeting.  As we made eye contact, they waved at us, and me, being the ever-friendly Dana, waved back enthusiastically. I was wearing about four rings, and I felt one shoot off my finger and I heard it "ping" somewhere on the restaurant floor, which is huge. I look down, and I realize the missing ring is Daniel's promise ring that he gave to me before I left to Portugal.  Crap, figures.  So I start looking, pacing the floor.  Soon, there are 20 people including the waitstaff, customers, hostesses, and managers, looking for this little tiny gold ring that could be ANYWHERE.  The rest of the restaurant is watching us, all amused as 20 people pace around slowly like autistic zombies, mesmerized by the patterns on the floor.    We searched for about 15 minutes, and finally someone near the entrance found it (it had rolled backwards like 10 feet).  I usually find the things I loose (we all know my wallet story and the trucker from Missouri), but I hate the fact that this kind of stuff always happens to me.  Imagine had it been an engagement ring, and I had been at a beach??  Never would have gotten it back....  The one good thing about my ring coming off my finger means that I lost weight.  I am exercising like crazy.  Well, actually, yesterday was my first real day . . . BUT I AM going to keep it up!  So I can gain it all back on Chinese food this fall!  I think I am going to take cooking classes in China too . .  maybe I can get to be as good a cook as the Sungmiester.

      Ricardo left today.  I didn't cry (thank you Lexapro), but I felt sooo sad.  He was probably my best friend here, the only person I knew here that wasn't going to judge me no matter what stupid crap came out of my mouth.  This sucks. . . . .    And our two cardinal babies left the nest.  I have now been thoroughly abandoned.  Just so you can see what happens in two weeks.  Maybe you can get as excited as I was.   urlLink    eggs&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Newborns&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The day before they left&nbsp; urlLink     Luckily, we still have four or five creepy featherless sparrow babies, but these were my first birdies, and I really feel a sense of loss.   So, we are slowly getting back into the old rhythm.  Bourbon Teriyaki wings tonight at the Vine with the med school group tonight.  Soon we are going to be drinking Smirnoff Blacks at the cliffs, gaping at Mark the bartender at Martinis, and smoking sheesha outside because it is daylight until 9, but nothing will stop me from missing Andres, David, and Ricardo.

      We had the last sheesha/wine night last night.  Full house as well, neighbors complained twice, even the landlord called.  Rubia and Ricardo's parents couldn't go back to Brazil yesterday due to mechanical problems, so she came along as well, and it was great to see her.   The night was so much fun, but sad as well.  Ricardo leaves tomorrow to Brazil. David is going with him, but plans to go to Missouri today, and then is going back to his new job immediately after.  Andres isn't leaving immediately, but he is going to Cincinnati to crunch numbers at AC Nielson by the end of June.  So, the rest of the group, Daniel, Sherif, Carolina, and me have THREE members to replace.  How do we find three worthy people?  These guys have been our friends for two years!    Anyway, I am slightly depressed.  I just can't believe it is all over, although I have to be thankful that it lasted this long into the summer.  Guess we are going to be taking some trips next year to Cincinnati, Saint Louis, and Brazil.  Man, Brazil is cool, but I sure wish they got jobs in New York and LA.  Cincinnati and Saint Louis aren't exactly top list tourist destinations.  But that isn't what I am going for is it?  Those cities are going to be Friends Destinations . . .

      Okay, if you are considering a new car, do NOT CONSIDER VOLKSWAGONS!! They suck.  Every two months mine breaks down (and dude, I drive around Iowa City, it isn't as though I get into wrecks all the time (in fact, I have NEVER EVER hit another car)) and I spend $1000 bucks each time, which totally eats up my savings.  My car, once again, is all screwed up and I am going to have to take it in first thing tomorrow.  And then the auto guy is going to try to screw me because I don't have a Y chromosome and charge $800 me for putting halogen into my lights or some bullshit like that.  Well, once again we are having sheesha night at our house (if we can find some coals).  We have had the "last" sheesha night at our house probably 4 times now, but this is the REAL one, as Ricky Martin is going back to Brazil in two days, and Mr. Brotherton got his job in Missouri.  Andres is also ditching town in one month.    Oh, and we are once again proud parents of five NEW baby sparrows.  That brings the tally up to seven birds with no feathers on our porch.  Crazy huh!!   I got some advice that I shouldn't use blogs to preach sermons, although I felt pissed off and I wanted it to be public.  So, next time, I will make it much more personal and do it in an email.  I have also self-censored my previous blog.

         I have a friend, a very dear dear friend of mine, one of the closest friends I have ever had.  He has known me for years, over five at least.  He has seen me in all states, happy, sad, frustrated, fat, skinny, drunk, sober, and stuck with me throughout.  He is a true friend, too generous, even when HE HAS NOTHING he gives you everything.   I want to make sure he knows this, that I love him, but his weakness his is generosity, and I don't want him to get hurt.  Dana

      This is especially of interest to all my MBA buds, who of course are corrupt and only care about the bottom line.  Willem, my bro, sent this to me:   I just saw a cool new word -- "astroturfing".  It refers to the practice of having your employees log onto various message boards and blogs, and anonymously posting in favor of your product while slamming your competitors'.  You're creating a fake "grass-roots" movement in favor of your product.  Cool, eh?  I thought you might get a kick out of that.

      I am really sore.  I went out for a run yesterday on all these back country roads that wind over really steep hills, and I am hurtin'.  I am going to take a day off, but I hope to actually stick to exercising.  I have a goal to run a half marathon by the end of the summer.  There.  I said it. Now that it is there for everyone to see, I have to do it.  So, these are my plans for summer.  As soon as I get back to Iowa, I am going to find work as a waitress.  I know it is going to suck, but I am going to kiss customer ass and make a ton of money.  This is so that I have appropriate funds when Elster comes back and we go to DC.  We all have to DC right if we are going to do DC, don't ya think?    The rest of the time, I am going to study Chinese. I had actually planned to take summer courses at the University, but they were canceled because they only had five students interested.  So, I am taking an online course . . . lets see how that works out, and getting tutored in the meantime.  In all the spare time I am going to have, I have a shitload of books to read by my new favorite author named  Louis de Bernieres.  He is fudging fabulous.  In fact, I am going to meet him one day because he is so absolutely great at what he does.  I am also going to get up our website ( I know I have been saying that for so long).     The latest nerdy endeavor I have is online essay contests.  I decided that I want some practice writing. I am entering one, a travel essay contest, on a place Habibi and I visited in the north of India.  Once it is ready, I will throw it up on the site.  The second one that is going to be a lot more time consuming is an essay on outsourcing American jobs.  it will run about 1500 words, and I basically have to come up with  a solution.  I am spending today (Friday) doing research on the whole subject.  I know it is soooooooo SFS of me to do this, but I really miss thinking and researching problems like this.  Anyway, if I win the $5000 dollars, DRINKS ARE ON ME!!!    Big kiss you guys, don't forget to keep up your blogs!

      I have always been jinxed when it comes to small creatures.  The cockroaches would always be in my shoes in Hawaii.  The caterpillars would always be in my broccoli from our garden.  The centipedes would always be in my room.     Now, put me in the Ozarks.  In an unexterminated house.  I wake up this morning, and I realize that something was in my bed.  Like crumbled triscuits.  I jump out, pull back the sheets, and realized that I had slept on a pile of acorn pieces and mouse shit.  It is all in my bed!  Figures.  Of all the beds in the house, the mice chose mine.  It wasn't as bad as our first trip to New Zealand.  My parents rented a house for a month, only to find that there was a slight ant problem.  They were everywhere!!!  Climbing the walls of the shower, on the plates, in the glasses.  Every night before I crawled in to bed I would pull back the sheets, sweep all the ants off of the bed, and climb in.   Luckily, they didn't bite.  That experience has made me a lot less squeamish about dead creatures, or their feces, in my bed.   However, the Ozarks also have a great upside.  We have hummingbirds at the feeders, deer prancing through the lawn everyday, rabbits skittering outside the house.  You cannot see one house from ours, only miles of gorgeous forested hills and lakes.  It almost makes me want to go out to the lawn and enjoy the nature when . .  oh wait, we haven't sprayed for the chiggers yet.  Silly me!  Oh, what?  You don't know what chiggers are?  Don't you want to come to Missouri and find out?  Or you could just check out this site: http://www.conservation.state.mo.us/nathis/arthopo/chiggers/  .  Well enough about me.  Here are some movie recommendations: BUS 174: Documentary about a bus high jacking in Rio de Janeiro in 2000 that ended in riots. City of God:  Tale of a favela in Rio de Janeiro shown through the eyes of a youth who lives there.  Birthday Messages:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO PANCRACIA!!

      I feel completely thrashed from this weekend.  I haven't partied this hard since I was a senior, and the weekend was ridiculous.  I embarrassed myself with impromptu speeches at crowded parties, but luckily everyone else was smashed and hopefully won't remember what an idiot I am.  Willem and Ellie both came up for my graduation, which was amazing.  Ellie's visit was fantastic, and she is still attracting Latin guys (better watch out Eichi!!)  It is good to know she hasn't lost her skills completely in Nippon land. I still think she needs to move back here and get an MBA and a hot guy and have little half-Asian kids, but she seems to like torturing herself at her job at Docomo.  Daniel kept up with me this weekend, which is uncharacteristic, but wasn't feeling too good this morning as he went in to operate on someone.  On a Sunday!! He also had to work Saturday! I can already tell, I hate OB-GYN.  Slave drivers.  On a happy note, our babies were born this weekend. We are now the proud parents of two new baby cardinals that were born on our porch in a little tree from Wal-Mart. They were born today after 14 days of the mother sitting on three eggs.  The last one hasn't hatched, not sure if it will as it seems smaller than the others . . .    Well, that is it for now. I am going to clean our house, as the numerous parties have piled dishes and glasses so high I think I am going to have to run the dishwasher twice just to make a dent . .  Some quick thank yous for the weekend: Ellie - For flying a total 28 hours from Japan for three days in the exciting metropolis of Iowa City. Willem - For driving a total of 16 hours to help me get inebriated. Dwight- For making sure I didn't wrap my car around a telephone pole after Ricardo's shebang. Caro and Mr. Brotherton - For giving me a great reason to buy you both drinks

      For those who know me well, this might be repetitive, but my Hawaiian name is Kilohana.  For those interested, I have posted a defintion of my name.  1. nvs. Name of the outside, decorated sheet of tapa in the ku'inakapa, bed coverings; the four inner layers were white, contrasting with the decorated kilohana. Hence extended meanings: best, superior, excellent. "He ali'i ke aloha, he kilohana e pa'a ai (saying)," love is like a chief, the best prize to hold fast to.

      My island is an active volcano, so earthquakes are common.  We have one or two large ones a year, and maybe a couple light ones every month or so.  They never get any larger than 6 on the Richter Scale, except for a 7.1 in the late 1800s.  For example, this chart is updated as of today:   urlLink    Earthquakes in the last two weeks&nbsp; urlLink     So, this shows that in the last two weeks, there were a couple of earthquakes, so you can imagine over the course of a year, how many there are.  We don’t even get under our desks or anything at school.  The teacher usually stops class until everything stops shaking, the kids giggle, and the lesson continues.  We do have some larger ones as well however. Here is a chart depicting recent earthquakes near the Big Island from 1962-89.  You can see that there are several that are over 5.5.    urlLink    Total Earthquakes from 1962-89&nbsp; urlLink     Here is a house destroyed in 89 by an earthquake that was a 6.1.   urlLink    House&nbsp; urlLink     The point is that living on a volcano for most of my life, I am familiar with earthquakes and what they feel like.  Which is why I was slightly confused that last night, while I was watching the movie, Along Came Polly, I felt my sofa start to shake.  I muted the television, and listened to my glasses rattling in the cupboards, and in about 10 seconds, all was quiet again.  No alarm mind you, the earthquake probably was light enough that had I been asleep, I don’t even think I would have woken up.  The Epicenter was 150 miles East of Iowa city, and registered at a 4.5.   urlLink    Earthquake Last Night&nbsp; urlLink     I know California and Alaska are the site of many quakes, but the Midwest?  So, using the Google, I started to do some research on earthquakes in the Midwest.  Apparently, we live in a large seismic zone called the Lincoln Anticline.  What is an anticline?  It looks like this.    urlLink    An Anticline&nbsp; urlLink     I hope that I have been informative in your quest for knowledge about Midwest earthquakes.

      I was supposed to run today, and didn’t. Work thrashed me so hard.  I was so sore when I got up this morning from running around delivering drinks at 808.  I guess I haven’t developed those bartending muscles yet.  I made another 50 bucks, so 150 total for the weekend.  Carolina and I met for lunch at Mondo's, where I got totally ripped off because I had scrambled eggs and toast and they charged me $8.99.  That would cost $2.00 at a diner or IHOP.    Then Caro tells me that she wants to go shoe shopping. I am way too lazy, but I agree.  So of course, I look for a pair of shoes that I can work in.  I want something close-toed, because people drop glasses and the break all the time, but I want shoes that I can wear with a skirt.  That is a hard combo for summer.  I find a pair, so I buy them in white and black.  The black they had to order from another mall, so I haven’t got those yet, but here is a picture of the white ones.   urlLink    White Flats&nbsp; urlLink     I also got a red pair of sandals.  As it is my favorite color, I thought I ought to have a pair of shoes that went with all my red clothes:   urlLink    Red Shoes&nbsp; urlLink     So of course I blew all my tips on shoes.  Not a bad thing to blow it on though! My greatest find for the day, however, was  a Missouri T-Shirt.     urlLink    missouri shirt&nbsp; urlLink    You know how ever state has a motto?  Hawaii is the Aloha State.  Iowa is the Hawkeye State.  Well, Missouri is the Show Me State.  This doesn’t make any sense at all, so I looked it up on the internet, and Missouri's nickname is usually traced to a speech by Missouri Congressman Willard Duncan Vandiver in 1899. Speaking in Philadelphia, he said: "...frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I am from Missouri. You have got to show me."  The T-shirt makes fun of this.  It says, “Missouri: The Show-Me State.  I’ll show you yours if you show me mine!

      It is 2:45 in the morning, and I am pumped.  I worked my frist night at 808 and it was so crowded, I had like three beers spilt on me.  You can't imagine.  I made $100 bucks tax free, and I could have made more if we had more people at the bar serving drinks faster.  I kind of like this!!  Gonna go to bed, cause I gotta do it all over again tomorrow night!!  Lots of kudos to Veronika's party.  If it wasn't for her birthday, my tips would have been sooo MUCH lower!!  Dana

      Everyone knows how obsessed I am with Colin Farrell.  I mean, I think he is fabulous.  I don't like his blond look for Alexander, however.  The only blond I like is Brand Pitt.  Well, I thought I would share this story on him that I found on The Fark.  I’VE always said there was something special about COLIN FARRELL – and now I have the proof.  It’s official — the Irish badboy is very, very well hung.   The bad news is his manhood is so big it had to be axed from nude scenes in new movie A Home At The End Of The World.   Boo hiss — I feel a petition coming on.   I can reveal Colin’s considerable chopper caused such a stir among audiences at test screenings that scenes showing his privates ended up on the cutting-room floor.   A source says: “All you could hear were gasps when Colin appeared in his full-frontal pose.   “The women were over-excited and the men looked really uncomfortable.   “It was such a sight it made it difficult to concentrate on the plot, so the decision was made to get rid of it.”   Michael Mayer, who directed the movie, in which Colin plays a bisexual in a love triangle, admits: “It was distracting.”   But don’t worry girls, all is not lost.   Colin is so incensed he won’t be shown in his full glory in cinemas (you’re not the only one, Col), he is demanding the scenes be included when the film comes out on DVD.   My insider tells me: “Producers have agreed, so his female fans have a treat in store.” Hurray  http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,4-2004290270,00.html  I AM SO GETTING THIS DVD!!!!

      No, SFSers, I did not just mispell FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), but I meant to say Fark.  I am a news freak.  I listen to the The World (http://www.theworld.org/) and The NYT audible versions every day.  I constanly refresh CNN and BBC and have started to read the leftist The Nation.  There is another news site that I look at (thanks to Willem Van der Oord), and Ihave wanted to give this site a plug for a while, but I kept forgetting.   It is Drew Curtis' Fark, found at www.fark.com.  It is offbeat news that is submitted by members all over the country and the world.  If you are sick of reading about the 9/11 commission, this is a great alternative.  These are all real stories, and they are rated as scary, intersting, spiffy, obvious, etc.  They have the link to the real newspaper in which they appeared, if you doubt the authenticity.  For example, today, some of the top stories were:  Nearly three million dollars worth of drugs -- including 559 pounds of marijuana -- are missing from the Memphis Police Department's evidence room. In other news, donut shops in Memphis report brisk business. (Scary)  482 more toddlers and elderly persons sued by RIAA for file swapping (Follow Up)  14 year old already held for murder charges kills again (Asinine)  Henry Doorly Zoo's gorillas get a new outside exhibit where kids can crawl through tunnels and pop-up in glass bubbles next to them. Nothing could possibly go wrong with that (interesting)  Okay, let me know how you enjoy!

      So, I just spent Father's Day in Theodosia, Missouri.  Our whole family was there, minus Emma.  Even Willem made the nine-hour journey from Lexington, KY.    For those of you who don't have a good idea where Missouri is, other than that it is in the "middle somewhere,"  I have provided you with a map.   urlLink    Somewhere in the middle&nbsp; urlLink     Theodosia is located right near the Missouri/Arkansas border.  Here is a closer map.  Do you see where that lake pokes up from Arkansas into Missouri way down south?  That is where Theodosia is.   urlLink    Another Missouri Map&nbsp; urlLink     For those of you who are map freaks, here is a map that is even more detailed.  We are located right by the star.   urlLink    Specifics&nbsp; urlLink     It is beautiful there, but remote.  Here is a picture of the mountains in fog.    urlLink    Foggy Ozarks&nbsp; urlLink     On Father’s Day, we went to Cookies, one of the only two restaurants in town serving a population of 250.  Afterwards we went to a mill and a trout farm.  Awww, isn’t that cute?  NO!  It wasn’t!  Do you want to know why?  Because we got bit by chiggers!!!  Longtime readers will know all about chiggers from my site, but I will give you all a refresher course.  The chigger is so SMALL it can’t be seen as it scurries along the skin surface seeking an attachment site. When it finds a suitable location, such as a skin pore or hair follicle, it attaches its mouthparts to the spot. On people, the chigger prefers places where clothing fits closely over the skin or where the flesh in thin or wrinkled.  These are areas that are warm like armpits, bikini lines, and balls.  Yes, I said balls.  My brother can attest to the veracity of my statement.

      I was running the other day.  It was still fairly early, so people had not picked up their newspapers yet.  As I jogged by a driveway, the headlines caught my eye.  “New Club Says Aloha.”  Well, of course I stopped and read the article, and this is basically what it said:  Malone’s had been bought by several managers from the Sports Column, another bar, and one of them was from Hawaii.  The new bar is going to be called 808, which is our area code for our state (Hawaii, not Iowa).  So after having lunch with Stephanie from the SOM, I stopped in and asked for a job serving.  They interviewed me and gave me a job right there.  When he saw that I was from Hawaii, he said, are you really?  I told him that I was, and he said, I am going to introduce you to the owner, you better not be lying (wink)/  I was introduced to Robby, the owner, and I don’t think he believed me at first.  He said, what part?  And I replied, “Big Island.”  Then he paused and said, “I went to Hilo High,” which is a town that is an hour and a half away from mine.  I think we both thought this is strange.  You rarely ever meet people from the Big Island on the mainland.  Most people come from O’ahu.    I replied, “I went to HPA (my high school).”  Then he asked me if I knew the Brysons, I said, “Of course! Mr. Bryson was my advisor!”  He then said he wrestled against, Richard, Mr. Bryson’s son.  I told him I had a crush on Richard, but was better friends with Nathanial, Bryson’s youngest son.  Small world, huh?  So I am actually going to be cocktail waitressing at a bar.  This is going to help me so I can own my own bar!  And Sungi is going to come help me!  If he ever manages to save enough money to come out and visit me . . .

      I challenged Sungi (aka Pleasure Man) a couple of days ago to write a post describing what his favorite job would be.  This is a job that would allow family time, if that is important.  The job must also be realistic.  Unless he has a fabulous voice, he shouldn’t pick being a rock star.  I would have a travel empire.  I would have my own travel show.  I would write guidebooks and have a monthly travel magazine.  After my fame reaches substantial levels, I would create a travel company that would do all sorts of cool trips.  Things for young adults with similar interests to get to know each other, like hiking and traveling.  It would be like Club Med in that most people would go as singles or small groups looking to meet people to travel with and have an adventure. I would have other trips too, like political travel, where you get to go to Afghanistan and Iran and Iraq, and take part in political debates (I know, I know, it is so SFS).*  I would also sponsor cultural exchange, like getting a running club in Kenya to host a running club in the states, and vice-versa.  So my company would have a for-profit and non-profit component.  That is my dream job!!

      So, I took this quiz, and had the same result as Sungi.  Maybe that is why we are such good friends.  Cause we feed off each other . .    You are glucose. People feed off of you. You are sweet, caring, and a source of energy for everyone around you. You can inspire others with your creativity and depth, and you can keep people alive when in times of famine.

      STAY AWAY FROM VWs!!  After spending 700 dollars because my car got wet (yes, that is why my whole electical system got messed up! Cuase it rained!), I am thinking, well, that was my major car hassel for the year.  But NOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Could I be that lucky!!! Of course not!!! I drive a VW peice of crap!!    The stereo doesn't work anymore.  If it is on, it turns off randomly, and if it is off, it just decided itself that it wants to listen to some music.  It is fucking possessed.  I am so pissed.  Of course I call the VW service department and the VW specialist recognizes MY VOICE!!! Do you how many times I had to have gone there for them to recognize my voice on the telephone!! Jesus H Christ!  I am so ticked off!  Anyways, I will repeat for all of you contemplating a VW purchase.  THEY LOOK COOL, THEY PRETEND TO BE GERMAN, BUT THEY ARE MADE IN MEXICO AND DON'T WORK AT ALL!!!!!

      I have to agree with Sungi (guisun.blogspot.com), the chat with Sodo, Habibi, and him was awesome. It was a little hectic with four people, because two of us would have conversations with each other.    Habibi told me something that was hard to believe.    Everyone who knows me knows I loose IDs like crazy.  I just lost my Virginia one at the airport (they make you take it out so many times, I think I accidentally tossed it), and so I finally got an Iowa license.  I had two Hawaii ones, a NJ fake, a Texas one, a Virginia one, and now an Iowa one.  This isn’t cause I move so much, but because I loose them.  Marco’s (Juanita’s brother) girlfriend, got a bunch of stuff from Juanita when she cleaned out her apartment in Boston two years ago, in which said stuff was my Hawaii drivers license.  So without asking or telling me, she uses my ID for two years until she turns 21 in DC.  Can you imagine what would have happened if she got caught!!  I could get fined.  What an idiot.   But, I get my ID back.  So I am stoked. It expired, I know, but it is nice having a little piece of home to carry around with me in my wallet. . .

      Last night we went to Dani’s (the Spanish one, not mine) house for a party for Cristian (the Mexican, not the Costa Rican), who just turned 24.  I think I downed a whole bottle of wine, so I had fun.  These guys actually cook really well, so when we got there at 10:00, there was this awesome spread.  Cristian (Costa Rica), made chicken legs and Caribbean rice.  I had it once before in Colombia, but not since then.  It is made with black beans and coconut milk, it is amazing!!  Cristian (Mexico) made chilequinos or something like that, which is fried tortilla with green salsa and cheese.  Spanish Dani made Spanish tortilla, and each guest brought something.  I wish I had more room, but I had gone to the gym so I came home and ate a ton cause I was hungry.    It is 90 degrees here in Iowa, so his apartment, that is the size of my bedroom, was unbelievably hot with the cooking and the room being full of people.  Dani found an air conditioner that didn’t work and had two fans going, but all the guys still took off their shirts cause it was so hot (too bad Ricardo isn’t around anymore).  Next party, I am going in a tank top and shorts.  Screw this looking good shit, I had white slacks on and nearly died from heat stroke.  It was cooler OUTSIDE, if you can believe it.  Before we went to Dani’s house Caro and I met up with Jesse, Veronika, and Vivi, who was on a blind date with some American guy that was really hot (I forget his name).  It was funny, because he counted on a blind date with one girl, but he got five of us! I started complaining about how CNN still has NOTHING but Regan’s casket on its news program and hasn’t shown anything else for the last five days.  It is as if the world stopped having coups and genocide and technological breakthroughs and NO NEWS occurred after Regan died.    Then Caro broke in and said she was pissed because in Nicaragua there was a mass for him.  Can you believe this!!  For a guy who sponsored a counterrevolutionary war that left some 50,000 dead and countless injured or maimed, destroyed much of Nicaragua’s infrastructure, strangled fledgling health and literacy campaigns and sunk the country deeper into the abyss of poverty and underdevelopment!!  The had a mass!!    CAN YOU BELIEVE NO ONE MENTIONS THIS AT ALL ON CNN??  Well, before I start ranting and raving, I think we made the guy a little uncomfortable.  Hopefully he and Vivi hit him off.  I wish he came to the party.  I would have liked to have seen him with his shirt off.

      Okay, well hearing Sungi (guisun.blogspot.com) talk so much about exercise, I decided I should put my two cents in as well.    When I ran my marathon last year, I really hurt my knee badly.  It started hurting at mile 13, but since I had put in 7 months of training, and had already run in the rain in 33 degree weather for 13 miles, I got stubborn and ignored it.  At around mile 21 however, I was limping so badly I could no longer run.  I walked the last 5 miles.  In the rain.  In what had warmed to 37 degrees.  Now, looking back, it was sort of stupid, but at the time it made sense.  As a result, I had to rest my leg for a couple of months, and then do NO exercise where my leg bent past 45 degrees.  That really rules out a lot, including running, some weight machines, hard swimming, and the bike.  I was left with walking (outside or on the treadmill) and the elliptical machine at the gym.    This was probably a good thing. People don’t realize how BAD running is for you.  Running stresses your joints, your organs, and your bones.  People are not made to run.  Animals like gazelles, horses, and cheetahs are made to run.  If you look at humans, our bodies don’t resemble theirs in the slightest.  It is much better to walk.   Now, most people don’t know this, but if you put the treadmill at a slight incline, you burn the same amount of calories running 2 miles as you do walking 2 miles.  The only problem is, it takes twice as long to walk to miles.  So here you have to start factoring in boredom.  So my trick is audible.com.  They have all these books and newspapers available for download online.  So, while I walk, I get to have someone read me the NY Times, or I get to “read” the latest novel that comes out.  Think about Barnes and Noble on MP3. It is fairly inexpensive, especially the newspapers, magazines, and radio programs.  So, if you are bored walking on the treadmill, it is just a suggestion to expand your mind instead of destroying your eardrums with deafening music.

So, I will soon be sending you all a change of address soon, as my university of Iowa account will expire in the next couple of days.  Another great gift I got was a CD mailed all the way from Japan with graduation pictures on it!  I will show you all what a real Iowa greeting is like:   urlLink    d&nbsp; urlLink     And here is a shot of the Elster, me donned in my graduation garb, Carolina, and Wakako.   urlLink    d&nbsp; urlLink     And Willem, Carolina has the picture of you with the hot girls sitting on your lap, so I will get a copy of that one!  My trip to Texas was filled with family and uneventful, although it was so much fun being in a major city again.  I think my next trip is going to have to be to DC, so get ready Sungi and Habibi!!

      Okay, I am dipping as low as you can go. Tomorrow, I am auditioning for a reality show.  It is crazy, but here is the description:  Kathy Hilton is the mother of Simple Life star Paris Hilton. Mother has decided to try on daughters shoes. Kathy Hilton will star in NBC's The Good Life, an eight-episode RTV series in which Mom will teach ten young women how to fit into high society. After all she did such a good job raising Paris. Mommy Dearest will fire/execute/exile and otherwise ruin one woman each week who does not meet her standards. The last remaining young, rich, brat gets a year's stay at the Waldorf-Astoria, a new car, clothing, jewelry and a starring role in an Internet porn scandal. Endemol is producing for NBC.   Here is the real description!  Kathy Hilton, matriarch of one of the most celebrated and successful families in America, is conducting a search for candidates to be taken under her wing in a new American fairytale where candidates will encounter the New York high-life and be introduced to culture, style, business and life's virtues.   Hilton, whose family created the famed Hilton Hotel empire, is looking for deserving men and women to take part in an uplifting unscripted drama for NBC. Hilton will play "Henry Higgins" to these candidates and help transform their lives by exposing them to a glamorous new life. Hilton will gather renowned cultural experts who will guide and enlighten the candidates along the way. After a series of competitions, Hilton will choose a winner who will receive an extravagant prize package including a residence at one of New York City's most exclusive addresses, and a wealth of experience.  Wish me luck!!!

      Hey y'all!  Yep, I have been in Texas for only a couple of days now, and the y'all creeped into my vocab.  I am in Abilene, which is famous cause there is a song about it, visiting my grandparents and aunt who live here.  It is sooo nice being around my "normal" cousins.  Nicholas is 5 and 1/2 and a big boy for his age.  He isn't fat, but he has a linebacker's build, and plays every sport imaginable.  He likes jumping into pools, is catholic and reminds everyone about "Christ our Savior," and has great blue eyes and blond hair.  His little sister, Avery, is 2 and a bit shy of people, but at least she doesn't seem the type to be doing drugs or bottlecapping cars like some other relatives of mine. .   Brandy (age 20), daughter of the infamous Kelly, is pregnant again.  Such and idiot.  Her first baby is only 6 months old, and she insists on popping more trailer trash into the world.  I mean, can she afford another kid?  Probably going to go on welfare and be another burden to society.    Her mother (if you can even call her a mother cause she doesn't act like it), also got pregnant last year and had a baby.  Aww, she and her 19 year old were pregnant at the same time!! How cute!!  She insisted on smoking throughout the pregnancy because she didn't want her baby to be "big."  My uncle thinks the baby is mildly retarded.  At three months it couldn't even hold its head up or something.      I guess I complain about my family, but they do provide entertainment .. . anyways, I have a sore throat and a fever, so I am going to go to bed.  I will share any family gossip as it occurs.

      Okay, this is an entry to a travel contest.  Here are the guidlines: "Select any city, town or village worldwide and convince the reader to visit this location by discussing any or all of the following themes - People, Natural Landscape, Architecture, Culture and History." Your essay SHOULD NOT be presented in guidebook format. Regions or specific attractions are excluded.   So let me know what you think! (Especially if I have any major mistakes, or something doesn't flow well)  I am exactly at 500 words, so if I add something, I have to take something out, so make suggestions.  Dharamsala    As the bus bumps across the blistering Punjabi plains, I glance at my watch.  Six hours remain of the 13-hour bus ride north to the state of Himachal Pradesh.  I try to observe the countryside, but the sticky heat makes me drowsy.  Somehow, with my head continually colliding against the window with the topography of the road and the driver’s incessant blaring of the horn, I fall asleep as darkness blankets India.   My destination is Upper Dharamsala, aka McLeod Ganj, and home to the Tibetan Government-in-Exile and His Holiness the Dalai Lama.  While Lower Dharamsala’s inhabitants are primarily Indian, the 8,000 Tibetans-in-exile have commuted the sleepy hill station of McLeod Ganj into a quasi-modern Tibet.    In a fog of weariness, I stumble off the bus and survey the architecture, more reminiscent of a medieval village than an old British hill station.  As I amble along the dirt road, I am ogled by two skeletal cows munching on garbage in an open sewer.  A maroon-robed monk with a backpack saunters past me trailed by two miniature monks, no older than twelve.  Soft-featured women clad in simple robes of muted purples bustle about, and the lingering aroma of the momos on outdoor stoves elicits a growl from my empty stomach.    After locking the windows of my room to prevent monkeys from filching my meager possessions, I climb to the roof of the inn.  The freshness of the air cuts my lungs after the dusty swelter of Delhi.  As the sun frees itself from the mountains, a breathtaking panorama of the Kangra Valley spreads below me.  To my left, nestled among the pine and oak, stands the bright red Central Cathedral of the Dalai Lama.  I chat with Ahmed, the innkeeper, who came from Kashmir ten years ago to escape the violence.  He speaks nostalgically about the beauty of his home state. After serving me some chai, he tells me that as soon as I am rested I must hike to Triund, nine kilometers from Dharamsala.    The next day, I follow his advice.  The path leads me through a wonderland of ancient forests filled newborn monkeys, rocky pastures, and desolate switchbacks.  I finally reach the Triund meadow and am astounded by a jolting view.  Almost completely occulted by the foothills surrounding Dharamsala, the majestic snowcapped Himalayas rise above me in full splendor. I sit down on a boulder to relieve the vertigo and contemplate my transience in the midst of the immutable peaks.   As dusk falls, I return to town and join the stream of devotees turning creaky red prayer wheels that encircle a Tibetan memorial, a symbol of the fight against Chinese oppression.  To me, the memorial is not necessary.  A memorial can be felt in the air, heard in the voices, and seen in the knowing eyes of those who make it their home. Dharamsala is island in the sea of India, and the town a beautiful and intriguing symbol of the brave adaptation to conflict of the people of Tibet.

      I am tired.  I am sitting in the Cedar Rapids airport terminal.  It is 8:45 am, and my flight to Dallas should have left two hours ago at 6:50 am.  For those of you trying to do the math, it means, I had to be here at 5:50 am, which means I had to leave Iowa City at 5:20 am.  Which means I was up at 5 am.  And I went to bed at midnight.  My plane had mechanical problems and is delayed “indefinitely.”  The only reason I was taking this early flight was because I didn’t want to waste a day, and I wanted to make a direct flight from Cedar Rapids to Dallas rather than pass through a hub at Chicago, Minneapolis, or Saint Louis.    It is ironic that my flight to Dallas through Saint Louis doesn’t leave until 11:00 am.  For those of you doing the math, that is over 5 hours in Cedar Rapids airport, which I am sure makes the top-ten list of crappiest airports in the US to be stuck at.  My breakfast consisted of Lays potato chips and a Starbucks Frappuchino.  A three hour trip has ballooned to a ten hour trip.   Thank you American Airlines.

      The Midwest experience includes many rituals, tailgating at six, worshiping college football teams, and learning to avoid any sort of conflict. However, you have not had the full Midwest experience until you have heard your town’s tornado siren go off.  There I was with Carolina, gossiping in my house, getting ready to pick up Sherif to go see Shrek 2, when a droning shriek filled the air.  Carolina and I looked at each other for a second, confused, when it dawned on us what that meant.    “Is that . . .” I started.  “A tornado siren?” Carolina finished.  We turned on channel nine for an update, and saw STORM WARNING flashing across the screen, and hyper-colored maps of Iowa depicting the cell concentrations over our county.  However, when we looked out the window ourselves, the sky wasn’t menacing, the wind was hardly mentionable, and the rain was slowly drizzling down.  “Ha!” Carolina exclaimed.  “The Midwest is so overly dramatic.  When we have a storm in Nicaragua, it is a real storm!  The rain comes down in buckets, and the streets are flooded, and I mean absolutely impassible, for hours!  Iowa City plans on getting an inch of rain, and it is the biggest news of the week.”  I agreed with her that a tornado siren was a little extreme for a storm.  I mean, in the movie Twister, when you heard the siren, you only had 30 seconds to get into your storm shelter or you were going to be sucked up into the stratosphere, right?  Wasn’t that the whole premise of the movie?  So we decided to continue with our plans and go downtown to pick up the sheriff and hit the movie.  Caro and I head off in separate cars because we both have errands to run.  As I am driving, it begins to rain a little harder, and I can see the tops of the trees starting to swoosh about.  I peered up out of the front window to survey the sky, and I saw black gray clouds that seemed close enough to touch.  Ah, its nothing, I say to myself.  I would see a tornado coming, right?    Soon the rain becomes a pounding sheet of water that my windshield wipers can’t clear.  The trees are whipping back and forth, and all of the sudden, I think, “Well, maybe looking for shelter wouldn’t be such a bad idea.”  While I am trying to see the lines on the road as there are no other cars about, my cell phone rang.  It was Carolina.  “Okay, uh, there is a tornado warning on the radio for Iowa City.  I think we should go back home.”  “My place or yours?” I ask her.  “Well. my place is a basement apartment . . “  “Done.  I’ll meet you there.”  So, Carolina and I poured ourselves a sangria, watched the Doppler radar on channel 9, and waited for the Mach 5 (or whatever the rating system is) tornado to hit Iowa City and tear apart her apartment building while we cowered in her bathroom.    The twister never came.  All we heard were two guys describing what the pretty colors meant on the radar screen and apologize over and over again for having to interrupt the race in Indianapolis to deal with the tornado threat across Eastern Iowa.  An hour and four glasses of sangria later, the warning was over and the skies had cleared.  I think, in truth, we were secretly hoping that it would hit Iowa City.  A tornado is a story that is still good a month, a year, or even 50 years after it happened.  My grandkids would have pleaded, “Grandma, Grandma, tell us the tornado story, pleeeeaase!”  Well, I guess I could always get some pointers from Twister and the Wizard of Oz and make it up.  Like they would ever know.  You know what was funny, the only thing I took with me when I heard the tornado siren was my computer.  No expensive jewelry, no photo albums, no books.  My computer is the only thing I would save.  It is strange, but the computer isn’t just a machine, it is my past.  My assignments, my to-do-lists, my budgets for the past two years, my letters, my job hunts.  Loosing my computer in a tornado would be like loosing a part of myself.  The jewelry, photos, and other keepsakes are replaceable in my mind, but the computer (or better, the information it stores) isn’t.  Kind of pathetic, but I think that nowadays, wouldn’t the majority of us do the exact same thing?

      Well, this is my second day in Missouri with my father, and we are having a load of fun.  All we do all day is sit on our computers, eat, and watch movies.  I should get my booty out the door and exercise, but I am just too lazy!    There is a mother deer and two fawns that live in out backyard.  When they are hungry, they come up to the house and just stand their and look at us through the window until my dad comes out.  When my dad brings out the grain, the kids and the mom skit away about 25 yards, and then as soon as my dad starts walking back to the house, they charge the food.  It is so funny, I have a video of it, but as I still don’t know how to put video clips up on my blog, I will have to just give you pictures.   urlLink    Bambis!!!&nbsp; urlLink     I am not sure where the bambis brother is . . . there are usually two of them . . .  So, great news!  I had no scary crazy dreams last night!  Just dreams about going on vacation with my family to Scandinavia and rivers filled with trout that ate ice cubes and popcorn.  The reason that I can actually even remember is that I started a dream diary.     Doso, I would still really like a prayer, that is really sweet .  I was born in the year of the goat baby!  FYI, “except for the knack of always getting off on the wrong foot with people, the Goat can be charming company. You are elegant and artistic but the first to complain about things. Put aside your pessimism and worry and try to be less dependent on material comforts. You would be best as an actor, gardener, or beachcomber. Some Goats: Rachel Carson, Michelangelo, Mark Twain, Rudolph Valentino, Barbara Walters, Orville Wright.”  On a grosser note, I ate two heads of garlic yesterday.  My mom cooks them in an oven so they are all soft, and then you spread them on bread with goat cheese.  So now, I reek of garlic, I have showered twice and brushed my teeth four times, but I just smell like garlic.  Of all people, my dad pointed this out to me.  He has broken his nose four times, once in a car accident and the rest in basketball, so he can’t smell anything.  But he can smell me.  So I am going to try to go for a run and drink a lot of water so I don’t smell so bad anymore.  If anyone has had this problem before with eating two heads of garlic, let me know what they did to get rid of it . .   I really really really want to go on a trip, but I am trying to be frugal and not spend my money.   On the other hand, this is my last long time off, and I feel like doing something crazy.  India was last summer, but I want to do something similarly nuts.  Too bad habibi is slaving away as an investment banker to do it with me!

      Recently, and more often, I have been having horribly violent dreams.&nbsp; I don't like sharing these with people because some are horrible.&nbsp; After Ellie visited me, I had a dream that she was again in Iowa, but spending the night in someone else's house because we had no room in ours.&nbsp; Their car was coming home after partying and she died when they crashed into the river.  &nbsp;I have recently been beaten, murdered, raped, all in my head at night.&nbsp; Today, when I was driving home I stopped at a rest stop to take a nap.&nbsp; I had a dream that I was bludgeoned over the head with a large rock, and people that I couldn't recognize because of my head trauma took advantage of my state to hurt me further.  Last night, I was shaking so badly and so obviously agitated that it woke Daniel up and he in turn shook me until I woke up so I would stop having such horrible pesadelos, pesadillas, moehewas, incubos, akumu (aka  naitomea  (Ellie, that one was for you!)).   I looked up violent dreams on the internet, and some jerk actually said that occasional violent dreams are gift, an opportunity to enhance our life in an unexpected way.&nbsp; I don’t think he has been repeatedly raped in his dreams and bashed over the head with large heavy objects.  The best thing I read was that dreams in where you are being attacked put you in a vulnerable role, meaning that in your every day life, you are feeling vulnerable.&nbsp; Intense violence in dreams  urlLink usually  suggests a need for  urlLink control  and a fear of  urlLink losing  power in a real life  urlLink situation. &nbsp; I find that interesting, and I suppose I will pay more attention.  I used to keep a dream diary as a child, so I think I will start that up again.&nbsp; I remember having or gaining much more control over my dreams as I wrote them down, so maybe I can exercise the same power now after I being to record them.&nbsp; I will let you know how I fare.   urlLink    Violence Painting&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Violence Painting&nbsp; urlLink

      Okay, as most of you know, my life is so hectic right now.&nbsp; New job, big move, trips all over . .&nbsp; I promise, as soon as I get settled in Theodosia, I will update you all with what is going on.&nbsp; I am actually using someone elses wireless&nbsp;internet connection in this building, as my apartment is completely vacent right now.&nbsp; Anyways, I promise I will be in contact tomorrow and write a book.&nbsp; Sungi, I will call you but I didn't have my cell phone this weekend.&nbsp; Bulchi-good job on the blog.&nbsp; I am proud.&nbsp; 1- Fantastic job!

      Okay, on a scale from 1 to 10, I am going to rate everyone's blog.  Sungi: 10 He writes almost everyday, sometimes twice a day, his anecdotes are always funny, and is willing to write embarassing events and about his emotional state.  Dana: 7 I write at least twice a week, and give everyone updates.  Sodo: 5 Pretty crappy, but&nbsp;recent efforts have been great, which accounts for the high score.  Ellie: 3 Uh, I appreciate the last blog, but I sure wish we would here from her more often.  Bulchi: 0 You just suck.&nbsp;   Wakako: 0 You don't even read my blog.

      I PASSED THE FOREIGN SERVICE EXAM!!!!&nbsp; WOOHOOO!!!!  Well,&nbsp;what I passed&nbsp;is the written part.&nbsp; The exam is split into two sections.&nbsp; The first, the written exam, takes all day and is includes world knowledge, US goverment knowledge, English comprehension, a personality exam, and an essay portion.&nbsp; This whittles the 18,000 candidates that took the exam down to 6,000.&nbsp; The 6,000 then take an oral exam that lasts all day.&nbsp; Of the 6,000 there are five hundred places in the Foreign Service&nbsp;available.  The chances of passing the first part are 33%, or 1 in 3.&nbsp; The chances of me passing the orals are 8%, or 1 in 12.&nbsp; Soooo, it is a bit harder, but I am stoked I got this far.&nbsp; It is kind of an SFS dream, I just can't believe I did it!!&nbsp; Not sure I am going to actually do it, but I am going to see how far I can get!&nbsp;

      Last night, Wakako, Tico, Caro, and I went out to wine night.&nbsp; We played a really fun game, in fact, I find it to be more fun than Never Have I Ever.&nbsp; It is called F*CK DATE KILL.&nbsp; Here are the rules.&nbsp; The player that starts names three people.&nbsp; The names can be actors, historical figures, people you know.&nbsp; Then each player has to say which of three people they would F*ck, which they would date, and which they would kill and why.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; We sometimes had the same responses, but most of the type we differed.  &nbsp;  At one point, Wakako named Eleanor Roosevelt, Martha Stewart, and someone else, like Barbara Bush.&nbsp; Tico said he would fuck Martha Stewart.&nbsp; We all roared with laughter and screamed, really? &nbsp;When Tico yelled back, “Yes, Yes, I would f*ck the shit out of Martha Stewart!” EVERYONE at the bar turned around and looked at our table.  &nbsp;  That of course made us laugh even harder.&nbsp; It was a great night.&nbsp; I was really really impressed.  &nbsp;   urlLink     Pancho Villa, con sus dos mujeres a la orilla&nbsp; urlLink

      Dear blog readers  &nbsp;  I am sorry to report, that I am allergic to peanuts.&nbsp; I ate some of the boiled peanuts that I made for a party yesterday, and I broke out in hives all over again.&nbsp; I polished of the rest of the potato salad that I had made for the Copa America party to which I dragged Sungi right before I left to wine night.&nbsp; I had put peanuts in the potato salad.&nbsp; Anyways, I am ticked off.&nbsp; I love peanuts.&nbsp; I don’t know much about allergies, but apparently it is a cumulative reaction, where one day it just gets severe enough. So my reactions will get worse and worse until I die.&nbsp; Crazy huh?&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Okay.&nbsp; I am totally pissed off.&nbsp; I remember being fairly itchy last night, and when I got up today, I had a rash that was covering my body.&nbsp; I think it is even on my scalp, but I can’t really check because of my hair.&nbsp; I am so irritated, because I know I can’t scratch, but satisfying this itch by raking my fingernails over it until I draw blood is the only thing that is going through my head right now!  &nbsp;  Now, I have never had a rash in my life.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; I have no allergies, can take seafood, peanuts, MSG, anything.&nbsp; So I freaked out and called Daniel because I have no health insurance and he asked me if I had a headache or nausea or anything. I told him no, and then he said was most likely a reaction to food, to take a cool shower, take some benedryl (or however you spell it), and try not to scratch.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Easy for him to say.&nbsp; All I want to do is drink right now so I can forget this HORRIBLE ITHCHINESS!!!! God!&nbsp; But it is still early in the morning, so best not to polish off the wine we have at home.&nbsp; I guess I will just have to suffer . . .

      God, it has been so long since I have updated.&nbsp; This trip to DC and having Sungi here plus work didn’t give me a lot of time . . .  &nbsp;  So I will recap quickly.  &nbsp;  When I go back to Hawaii, I am so nostalgic, and I want everything to be the same, but for some reason, I feel out of place.&nbsp; It isn’t as though much of the Big Island is different, but maybe I am too different, so my visits are always spent having fun, but trying to figure out how I fit in.&nbsp; I am only telling you this so you know that I was expecting DC to have the same feeling.&nbsp; Fun, great memories, but, well, things just not fitting together right. &nbsp;&nbsp;I was wrong! It was great, it made me want to be back there sooo badly!  &nbsp;  So Sungi, slightly inebriated on Wednesday night, purchased a ticket to visit me in Iowa.&nbsp; I thought it was a great idea at the time, but then I realized what a waste it was.&nbsp; Priceline gave him a ticket that got him here at 9:30 on Friday morning, and had him leave at 6:00 am on Sunday.&nbsp; For the record, that is a total of 44.5 hours here in Iowa and Sungi slept through much of it.&nbsp; Friday, Sungi crashed out at 2 and slept until 9 pm.&nbsp; He then went to bed at 3:30 am and got up at 9:00 am.&nbsp; Amazingly, we kept him up until 9 pm Saturday, where he went to bed until he had to get up for his flight leaving in the morning.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So, the only time we went out to party was when I was working on Friday night.&nbsp; As many of you know, Friday night is Dollar-You-Call-It at 808.&nbsp; Which is the shittiest night to work because the bar is packed.&nbsp; I got so much alcohol dumped on me from these huge foot ball-type guys crashing into me as they fake wrestled their friends, or couples attempting to dance but basically just grinding against each other all over the bar.&nbsp; I was so sticky that napkins would defy gravity and act like post it notes when they came in contact with my clothes.&nbsp; Sick.  &nbsp;  I had a good night money-wise, but I get really stressed out when all my friends show up.&nbsp; I want to serve them, but I am in a bad mood and they get the brunt of it.&nbsp; They don’t tip that good because they know me and they have never worked in a bar, and truthfully, they order stupid drinks that are a pain in the ass to make and make me wait a long time at the bar while tequila sunrises and stuff get prepared.&nbsp; Beers are fast, drinks with one mixer like soda or tonic are fast, but long islands, kamikazes, all these girl drinks just suck to make.&nbsp; Just a heads up, so when you ask for a drink to a busy bartender, if you keep ordering pain-in-the-ass drinks he is a lot less likely to respond to you the next time (amazingly, they do remember what you ordered).&nbsp; I would much rather serve my section of people that I don’t know, that tip well, and order beers.  &nbsp;  So, Sungi and I spent all of Friday (day) with Wakako, and of course, she cast him under her spell.&nbsp; The thing is, she is pretty, but her personality and uniqueness just make guys drool.&nbsp; She listens when you talk, which sometimes I don’t do, is witty, funny, and makes guys feel like they are the only person in the room.&nbsp; When she does that, they fall hard.&nbsp; Mithra is a very lucky lucky guy.  &nbsp;  Saturday I worked for lunch at 808 and  NO ONE CAME IN .&nbsp; Well, that isn’t true, I made Sungi and Daniel come in, but of course they didn’t tip me cause they  KNEW ME!!  So I made $3.09 and hour.&nbsp; Do you guys know that??&nbsp; That is how much waitresses make.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Three dollars and nine fricking cents an hour .&nbsp; Just remember that.&nbsp; Two dollars under minimum wage.&nbsp; Just so you have an idea: If you work 40 hours a week, that is $123.6 dollars a week.&nbsp; If you work 50 weeks a year, that is  a salary of $6,180 a year .&nbsp; So, be nice to us.&nbsp; Even if your waitress is in a bad mood, it is probably cause she makes $3.09 an hour.  &nbsp;  Okay, so I dropped Sungi off yesterday morning, and the days are already getting shorter.&nbsp; When I went to DC, it was light (barely) at 4:30 in the morning.&nbsp; We drove to the airport in total darkness.&nbsp; Sad . . . Summer is ending, slowly.  &nbsp;  As an end note, I just heard about The Talking Fish.&nbsp; I had no idea this happened, and it puts me in a great mood.&nbsp; For those of you in my boat and have no idea about the fish that could speak Hebrew (before they butchered it at the fish market), here are some links:  &nbsp;  http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,915125,00.html  &nbsp;  Pakistani newspapers even got it!  http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_17-3-2003_pg9_6

        This is very antichronological, but I wanted to put this up with the pictures so I had to wait until I got back from DC. &nbsp;   Okay, so the family reunion wasn’t as exciting as I thought it was going to be.&nbsp; Well, I take that back.&nbsp; It was fun, but there a lack of gossip.&nbsp; Here are some snippits.  &nbsp;  My Aunt Elaine (orange shirt) is my mother’s sister-in-law.&nbsp; She hates everyone.&nbsp; Especially my mom.&nbsp; She tells all my cousins that my mom is evil.&nbsp; We know this, because they come up to my mom, ask her if she is the devil, and when my mom laughs and says, “No,” they say, “but Aunt Elaine said you were!”&nbsp; She is anorxic, and my brother thinks she is a vampire.&nbsp; But we don’t tell our cousins this.  &nbsp;   urlLink     Elaine&amp;nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  Here is a picture of my cousin Laurel winning the limbo contest.&nbsp; Look how low that poll is to the ground.&nbsp; She got under 13 inches!!  &nbsp;   urlLink     Limbo Laurel&amp;nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  And here are my younger cousins, Jesse, Sarah, and Mary.  &nbsp;   urlLink     Cousins&amp;nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  At every family reunion we do the limbo, the hokey pokey, and the chicken dance.&nbsp; It is just really Italian American to do all of them.&nbsp; If I can figure out how to put in a video link in of the chicken dance cause it is just TOO hard to explain, I will do it.  &nbsp;  Here is a picture of the Bed and Breakfast that we stayed at.&nbsp; It was a really pretty Victorian Mansion called The Abbott House (Abbott is my middle name, from Abate (Italian).&nbsp; My mom and brother are on the porch swing.  &nbsp;   urlLink     The Abbott House&amp;nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  And here is a final picture of the immediate family reunion.&nbsp; All the cousins couldn’t make it, but all of my uncles and aunts are in the picture, along with my grandparents.&nbsp; I am down at the bottom, holding Avery.  &nbsp;   urlLink     All of Us&amp;nbsp; urlLink

      Sungi and Habibi and I are having a great time.  We are drinking a little too much, but that is to be expected.  So, I got in at 11:30 and Sungi and I IMMEDIATELY went to Peacock.  Then we went to have a Sam Adams and I got my hair done at Molecule near downtown.  I tried to go see Stephen, my old boss, but Hank (Dr. Kissinger) was in town at the office so no one called me back.  Jerks.  So I went shopping instead and Sungi made me buy the dress that you can see on his blog (guisun.blogspot.com).  Then we went to Cafe Citron and had capirinhas and mango mojitos and then onto Japan Inn where I ate a ridiculous amount of Sushi and drank a large sake.  Then we went back to Sungihno's place and watched Stuck on You.  It is horrible watching Matt Damon go down the tubes and do stupid movies.  Yesterday we met with Zeca who flew down from NY where he was visiting with his sister Marina (who is still with Jason after 8 years) and we went to The Tombs!  Ala the old tradition we had a pitcher of Yuengling, baked brie, Clyde's Chili, and a Spinach Salad.  I went to go visit the crew at KMA and left Sungi and Starbucks, and later we all got together at Cactus Cantina and we had a pitcher of swirl margarita and daiquiri.  Mmmm, just like the old times.    I remember once when we didn't finish off a pitcher, so Ellie and I (slightly inebriated) poured the margarita slush in a tall red plastic glass, stuck it in my purse, and walked out with it and drank it on the way to The Tombs.  God, we were such lushes!!  I will fill you all in on events for today later!

      Before we went to New Jersey on Friday, we went to stay at my mother’s cousin’s house outside of Philadelphia on Thursday.  My mother’s cousin, Kathy, went to Georgetown.  After G-Town, she worked for six months, and then  traveled for six months for a couple of years.  She met her husband, Ivan the Australian, while backpacking through Tahiti.  She has for amazingly pretty girls.  They have the signature Yeager look (that is my grandmother’s maiden name (Jewish-German)) with light eyes and dark hair.  Here is a picture of Tristan (on MY right) and Steph (my left).  Her other two older daughters are touring Europe and Brazil.   urlLink    Tristan, me, and Steph&nbsp; urlLink     Kathy’s parents are my grandmother’s brother George and his wife Gail.  So they are my mother’s aunt and uncle and my great aunt and uncle.   Here is a picture of them:   urlLink    Me and Uncle George and Aunt Gail&nbsp; urlLink     They have a pretty cool house.  Paul and I played with the girls in the pool and taught them how to play bumper butts (if you don’t know how to play that, you had a poor childhood).   urlLink    House&nbsp; urlLink     And on Friday, it was off to New Jersey!

      Okay, so my brother, who used to have curly unruly hair has decided to straighten it.  Here is a picture of him in Saint Louis.   urlLink    Straight Hair&nbsp; urlLink     My mother has made a request to my father that he grow a mustache.

He had a seen a special on it on the Discovery Channel.  The hold a bunch of quirky medical oddities, for instance:  The skeleton of a giant that was 7’9”, pictures of people with syphilis, fetuses in formaldehyde with spina bifida, skeletons twisted by malformations, and cast of the first documented pair of Siamese twins:  I took some pictures of not the weirdest things, but some cool things that would come out okay with the flash.  Here is a spine of someone who had tuberculosis of the spine which caused several vertebrae to fuse.   urlLink    Spine with TB&nbsp; urlLink     Any guesses as to what this is?

Some of them had no brains, just a flat plane above their eyes.  Others didn’t have legs, just this tail coming to point where their legs have fused together.  It was sick.  Then we went to go eat, but I seriously didn’t have much of an appetite.

      So, I am still in Missouri.  It is 5:15 on Thursday and I am sitting in an airport lounge at Lambert Internationla Aiport in Saint Louis.  There was a major storm in Philly, so no flights went in at all last night from here.  We went to the airport at 5 and finally at 8:00 we went to a hotel.  My dad, of course, hates traveling and anything, and I mean ANYTHING (changes in plans, late planes, long rides, mean flight attendents, whatever) stresses him out horribly.  He got into an awful mood!  I tried to get him drunk on Foster's beer at a bar at the airport, but all attempts were in vein.  He stayed in a really bad mood.    He and my mother and brother drove 4 hours from Theodosia to Saint Louis.  Because of all the delays adn the fact taht we were going to have to stay in a hotel, he complained and complained and finally decided to drive back to Theodosia (four hours!) last night rather than go to the family reunion in New Jersey.    I tried to convince him to come with us, or at least spend the night in Saint Louis so that he cuold decide in the morning to drive back to southern Missouri or not, but he was looking for any excuse to go back.  He hates family gatherings anyway, especially with my mom's side.  I guess he just can't take the drama.  My whole family tried, but he didn't really want to go at all, so he ended up leaving.  I called David Brotherton (our friend my MBA program) because he is wokring in Saint Louis.  We had a couple of beers, and we caught up about what had been goign on in our lives for the last month since graduation.  He went to visit Ricardo in Brazil for a month, so he had lots of gossip, especially about a Brazilian girl named Fernanda who just finished law school and is really smart and pretty that he hung out with a lot.  10:30, and we had a wake up call at four, so I am going to get some coffee.  I will keep you all updated!!  Kisses!

      So, I am starting week two in my new life as a cocktail waitress.  My projections for my Friday night were way off.  I only made $70, but there were several factors that contributed to my lower tips.  The weather:  Iowa City is having a jazz fest this weekend, so we expected tons of people, especially for happy hour.  But alas, Chac (the Mayan god of rain and lightening) was feeling feisty today, and opened up the heavens on Iowa City.  Everyone ran and ducked for cover at 8 when the downpour started, so not many people were walking around.  Staff:  Rather than two cocktail waitresses for the whole bar, there were three of us, cutting down on orders and the number of tips.  Dana:  I got lazy.  Rather than going to four or five tables, collecting orders, and then running to the bar, I would get orders from two tables then go.  This cut down on my confusion and stress level as I didn’t have to remember which drink was the Jack & Coke, and which was the Rum & Coke when they all look the same, but it also meant that I only got to half the tables in the same amount of time.  Whatever, I had a great night.  Daniel pointed out that technically, I am only making 10 dollars an hour (when you factor all the time in and everything). However, I am getting  10 hours an hour to party with an awesome staff and free alcohol any time I want it, and all I have to do is deliver a couple of drinks to people.  How many people can say that about their job?  There is a downside.  The vomit.  I watched two people vomit.  The first guy was so drunk, he vomited red goo all over the floor, asked me for a bar towel, and then tried to clean up his own vomit, and proceeded to vomit all over the towel and then floor.  It was great.  Then there was the guy who vomited into a pint of beer.  Then he set the beer on a table.  Nasty huh?  I mean, if you have the accuracy about you to vomit into a cup, shouldn’t you be able to get to a trashcan?  So, I am also learning about so many kinds of shots and liquors.  My favorite so far (shot) is called a bloody brain.  It is incredible and tastes really sweet.  You take peach schnapps, slowly poor in Bailey’s which slowly curdles, and then add some Grenadine, it looks like this:   urlLink    Yummy!!&nbsp; urlLink     I have also tried a Klondike bar shot, liquid cocaine, snake bites, Kansas City Waters, Three Wise Men.  There are so many!!  If I find any other interesting ones, I will let you know!

      Well, of course I started wondering what kind of kiss I was too . . .     You have a dominant kiss- you take charge and make sure your partner can feel it! Done artfully, it can be very satisfactory if he/she is into you playing the dominant role MEORW!    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Yesterday I served food for the first time.  It was really fun!  It was our first day open for lunch, there was massive construction right next door that created a dust storm, and we had a very limited simple menu, so we didn't get a lot of people in.  About five groups came in, and I got two tables.  I made $10 in tip, which on two meals totaling $25.20, that is 39%.  Considering lunch is 10%, dinner is 15%, and great service is 20%, I don't think I made out too bad.  I am cocktailing tonight, so I have got to really work it.  Friday is going to be nuts, because I serve lunch (I have to get there at 10:00), and then I get to go home for a couple of hours and hten I come back and work all night.  It is dollar-you-call it again, which means it is going to be fricking insane.  But, I am going to make bank!    This time, the problem of the bartenders being too slow in serving me is going to be solved.  Apparently, they hired a barback.  What is a "bar back" you ask?  This is the dude that relives the bartenders of the hassel the encounter while working.  As the servers bring back glasses, instead of the bartenders washing them while they try to serve drinks, that is the bar back's job.  The bar back is usually a bar tender in training, and he does the grunt work.  Basically, the bar back will help us serve drinks and give the bar tenders more time to serve rather than clean.  My goal is to get over $125.  Lets see how it goes!  Dana

      Hey you all.  Sorry I have been MIA.  God, I just can’t live at home anymore. I am so sick of my mom and dad giving me advice.  I am taking off to Texas tomorrow to go hang out with my relatives.  I would go to Iowa, but I think I just need a break and rather than answer questions I just want to be talked at.  I want to go see a bunch of foreign films at all the indie theaters and just shop and go to nice restaurants and not be in bumblef***   Missouri.    I mean, this is how my exciting day went.  I got up, hiked an hour, and drove an hour to Wal-Mart, drove back, ate, watched the Sopranos, got unwanted advice from my mom, ironed, and played on the internet.  Very exciting.  Now I am going to be forced to watch Basic for the third time.  I am just going to drink a lot of wine and hopefully finish the book I am reading, The Janson Direction.  It is by Robert Ludlum, who does the Bourne Supremacy Series.  Let me just tell you, that movie was an embarrassment to the story line.  The Bourne Supremacy is one of the most amazing books I have read, and the movie was STUPID.  Anyways, when I am in Texas I will have cell phone contact as I will be out of the boonies, so I will talk to you all soon!  Mua!   Ellie-please write at least two lines on your blog to let us know that you are all right and your mom is okay.

His name was Heirama, and he was half-Tahitian and half-American.   urlLink    Prom 1995&nbsp; urlLink     This is prom from my sophomore year.  I was 16. My boyfriend’s name was Devon.  He was half Japanese and half Chinese, but home grown in Hawaii.   urlLink    HPA Prom 1996&nbsp; urlLink     And this is a group of pictures from my trip to Tahiti before I went to the cold gray world of Switzerland.

      My brother and father bought a lot of DVDs on Ebay.  They spent a fairly inexpensive amount of money for 25 DVDs, random collections such as Spy Kids and Silence of the Lambs.  On of the DVDs was called The Worst Faces of Death.    It is horrible.  It has caught tens of people dying on video, with this sad depressing music in the background, people are decapitated, shot, murdered, hit by cars, blown up all up close and personal.  I watched one man get decapitated, but only half way.  His entire throat was opened up, and his head hung onto his body by a flap of skin.  I couldn’t watch anymore.  It was horrible.  I am so thankful that I live where I live, because so many people live lives where they know they might not be alive tomorrow.

      What kind of blood type to you have?   My father is B + and my mother is A -.  Both my brother an I have very rare blood, AB -, but that means we can recieve A or B, as long as it is negative.        TYPES      DISTRIBUTION  RATIOS         O + :1 person in 3 38.4%        O - :1 person in 15 7.7%        A + :1 person in 3 32.3%        A - :1 person in 16 6.5%        B + :1 person in 12 9.4%        B - :1 person in 67 1.7%       AB + :1 person in 29 3.2%       AB - :1 person in 167 0.7%   So if there are 6.38 billion people on this planet, I only share blood type with 44.6 million of them.  A person with O + would share blood type with 2.45 billion.    Just another random statistic about me . ..   Dana

      Another tale in Dana's World of Stupid.  I am bidding on somethign on ebay.  I mean to type in $.99 for something.  Instead, I type in $99.00  Which isn't that bad, because you have a second change to change it before you submit.  Of course I didn't change it.  I just clicked submit and didn't look closely.  So know I am spending a lot of money on something I don't really need, I was just going to buy if it stayed around a dollar.  And I know that some jack ass is going to bid me up high. Shit!

      I did get back from the Caribbean and had a fabulous time.  I could go on and on, but there are other trips I am looking forward to, like the trip to Alaska.  I know this seems random and all of the sudden, but basically Willem was bitching about my lack of time if I get a job, and well, we decided spontaneously to do this cruise.  This cruise is listed on the website for 1,500 and we got it for 525.  I was stoked. I have never been on a cruise before, so I am sure I will either come back raving or bitching.  There is a really expensive land excursion to go dog sledding, but Jesus, how often do you get to go dog sledding?  Tonight is party night in the Ozarks.  Are you ready for the grand slamming time we are going to have?  are you ready to get jealous that you are not in Theodosia, population 238?  Okay, well, let me tell you. Tonight are the results for the County Council elections.  My mother, whom you all know as a famous campaign director under Daddy Bush (not), donated her time to Gloria Noah’s challenge to the incumbency.  And tonight, our efforts will bear fruition or be proved to be all in vain.  We are going to the Winner/Looser party (depending on the results). I will fill you in on the mad partying when we get back!

      Okay, you don't have to text to send a message to me anymore on my cel. you can do it from the internet.  Teleflip™ started when the founder became increasingly frustrated at his inability to send text messages to friends' cell phones from his PC. It was of course possible, but you had to know the cell phone provider, the correct domain name and the correct syntax for the email address. There had to be an easier way....Teleflip™ was born.   The next time you need someone to email you directions, a recipe, sales information, or maybe just a few sweet nothings... tell them to TELEFLIP™ it, at:   (yourcellphonenumber)@teleflip.com.   So, if you ever want me to recieve a text, mynewcellphonenumber@teleflip.com, and I will recieve the message right away.  I am going to do all my texting like this from now on. Please pass the message on, I think this is a great business.  Dana
