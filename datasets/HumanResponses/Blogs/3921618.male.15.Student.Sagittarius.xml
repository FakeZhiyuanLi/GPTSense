						    urlLink    Hey kids! I'm back again to talk about skillet. This is just another great band that I like a lot. They are awesome, and not only in "heavy" songs like "Savior", but also in songs like "Jesus, name above all names". Just Check it out....

						   Boys and Girls; tonight I learn something very important: How&nbsp;is dangerous to work with your web...thing's template. Thank God that&nbsp;I&nbsp;didn't made&nbsp;any stupid thing, and now you can enjoy at your left, 3 beautiful GIFs that almost cost this web...thing. So when working on your template it is better to have a notebook on your desktop tray!

						    urlLink    Alright Folks! I am back after my dinner, (pizza of course) to talk about one of my favorites bands: Relient K!!!! These 4 boys from Ohio just know how to play a perfect punk rawk! Check them out in their last cd, two lefts don't make a right...but three do, and of course songs like: "Marilyn Manson Ate my Girlfriend" and "Chapstick, Chapped Lips, and things like Chemestry". By the way, this is a desktop background, you can get it by pressing the buttons in your mouse and all that other stuff...     This picture was taken by someone with a camera...
