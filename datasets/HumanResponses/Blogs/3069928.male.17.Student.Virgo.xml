      I've been watching all the news today concerning Saddam and the charges brought against him by the Iraqis courts. I've been watching all the news today concerning his attitude toward the judge. I've been watching all the news today concerning what Saddam's future holds. I've been watching all the news today concerning the outcry for his immediate execution.  I've been watching all the news today concerning the people who sympathize with him. Primarily, the socialist loons in Europe.  I know this is a cliché argument, but how could a sane mind of any man sympathize with such a ruthless, autocratic barbarian such as Saddam? Tens of thousands of people died by his political tallons, yet not one socialist in Europe is calling for the death penalty. Why? Of that's right--they never were in the first place. These were the same people who wanted Saddam to be tried at The Hague in the The Netherlands, but the US rightfully shunned that request away, so the Iraqis, the prime victims of this tyrannical monster, could try him accordingly.  But the French and Germans see it otherwise.  Claudia Roth, the German government's top human rights official told the AP earlier today, "To start out this way does not send a good signal. I think it would have been a signal of democratic strength had they not reinstated the death penalty in Iraq."  What does she mean by "good signal?" Iraq is now a free and sovereign nation--and by that logic, the Iraqis have the ability to do  whatever  they want with him... it is their freedom to do so. Oh wait, that's right, now I remember, this is coming from the same country who is instituting regional unionization in Europe, hoping to sap power away from the individual citizens of that continent. Now that I think about it, I'm really not surprised--these are also the same folk who wanted to rule the world at one time.  France wouldn't hold their tongue either--earlier today they asked the Iraqis to hold a trial which would conform with international laws.  Yes, yes. The same international laws which prohibit death to the world's most hardened and ruthless dictators. The same international laws which have kept Solobadan Milosevich awaiting trial for well over two years now. The same international laws which seek to undermine every element of sovereignty and individualism across the world. I'm sure the story with France would be different if they were prosecuting Nazi war criminals who uncontrollably ravaged and raped the French countryside during WWII. Ah, yes, "death" isn't so bad after all, is it Mr. Chirac?  But what about the bigger picture? What about the European Union?  Don't worry, they're just as diluted as well.  Emma Udwin, the external relations spokeswoman for the European Commission declared that the EU intended to let Iraq know about its opposition to the death penalty.  Seriously, who cares? Last time I checked, Iraq is not part of the European Union. Oh, silly me, I forgot! Europe  always  knows best... even when it comes to new Middle Eastern democracies which have lived under the hand of a barbaric dictator for almost 4 decades. Yes, Europe always knows best... wasn't Nazism a fantastic idea?  Also, has anyone noticed the split in the European Union? The western part of Europe which has enjoyed freedom since the end of WWII is becoming increasingly socialist--while the eastern side of Europe, which was oppressed for the better part of the 20th century, is becoming increasingly more and more individualistic. Just today, Poland's Foreign Ministry Spokesman, Boguslaw Majewski, said this about the Iraqi trial of Saddam:  "Our reaction is obvious. This is a sovereign decision of an independent court and of the Iraqis themselves."  And rightfully so. Anyone who understands freedom understands the right to capital punishment... unless of course you're from France or Germany. Let's just hope they don't try and influence the Iraqis to make their constitution 100,000 pages like they did with the EU's.

      You know every once in a while, some celebrity comes out and talks inconceivable amounts of trash concerning President Bush, his administration, the war effort, or just republicans in general.  Well, last night at Radio City Music Hall in New York, the Kerry/Edwards campaign held a fundraiser where many celebrities came together with several music artists to push the Kerry-Kool-Aid-Drinking rhetoric down the throats of hundreds of partisan Kerry supporters. Obviously, no liberal would object to this. When celebrity leftist elites like Chevy Chase, Meryl Streep, and Whoopie Goldberg unite to raise money for a democrat like Kerry, you can be sure more than air is going to be hitting the fans...  As the fundraiser opened, Senator Kerry remarked that "every performer here represents the heart and soul of the American people."  Oh really?  Shortly after the introduction, Whoopie Goldberg came on stage and went on a tirade using President Bush's name as a sexually explicit reference to the female genitalia. Her X-rated comedic repitoire was followed by a slew of Bush-bashing comments from other high-profile figures. Actress Jessica Lange called Bush "a self-serving regime of deceit, hypocrisy and belligerence." Paul Newman said Bush's tax cuts were "borderline criminal." Chevy Chase made a remark saying the latest book Bush had read was "Leader of the Free World for Dummies." Among these comments, the ever so cliché arguments of "No blood for oil!" and "How many lives per gallon?" and "Bush lied; people died!" were in full swing. Of course, no democratic fundraiser would be complete without some sort of music figure like John Cougar Mellencamp working "Bush is a thug" into one of his songs.  Now in all honesty, which sane moderate or right wing American isn't surprised about this type of rhetoric from our pals from Beverley Hills? Anyone who knows anything of the political world knows Hollywood is dominated by the left wing and their extremist utopian ideals. Heck, it all started back during the Vietnam War when a young "Hanoi" Jane Fonda went on her pro-communist, anti-American campaign in order to undermine the efforts of our troops.  Unfortunately, this type of Hollywood leftist bomb-throwing is all but the standard these days. The real problem is that John Kerry, who could very well one day be President, did not condemn these comments--even when they were going on  at his very fundraiser.   How does "Bush is a liar" express "the heart and soul" of every American out there? Last I checked, the majority of this country approves of Bush, and he is still leading in the polls against Kerry. So wouldn't saying that such radical comments represent the opinions of so many American citizens be a serious misjudgement, if not a downright lie? Kerry was reported as gleefully laughing and accepting the X-rated jokes being made by Goldberg while in the crowd.  But it doesn't end there.  Kerry hopped on a plane this morning, with John Edwards, to continue his campaign into West Virginia... only to talk about America's values.  America's values? This guy has the gall to go to a fundraiser, condone bombastic rhetoric from Hollywood's leftist elite, then goes on to a swing state in the election to talk about values? This is the most blatant hypocritical act Kerry has engaged in yet. This entire situation is just as comparable to his claims that he is a devout catholic, yet he has no problems condoning and supporting the heresy of abortion and the pro-choice stance.  John Kerry has no "values." The only values this man has is bastardizing what is good and holy in this country.  I know people have said this before, but this is just another example of John Kerry being an opportunist. He never really has a concrete stance on anything anymore--even when it comes to the extreme rhetoric spouted by Hollywood nuts. He's always catering to both sides, and always tries to act as if he's everyone's friend.  It's all about politics. It's ok if some high profile pop-star or actor calls Bush a Nazi, or something along those lines, but when Republicans use the F-word with a Democratic senator, EVERYONE gets in a tizzy. Aren't these liberals the same ones who want freedom of expression?  Oh, now I remember. Freedom of expression is only needed when the "expressions" conform to their agendas.

      Well as usual, I was toiling through WorldNetDaily today to find a certain article concerning a book that talks about the rhetoric (see: "Hollywood: It's all that's Left!") the left wing uses day-in and day-out.   urlLink Liberwocky: What Liberals Say And What They Really Mean   Why didn't I think of this stuff? Finally a complete way to understanding, and putting those kool-aid drinkers in their place!

      Well, it certaintly has seemed that way, no? At least until, it's been relatively speculative of how Clinton is campaigning for Bush so Hilary can run in '08... on that note, here's another incident supporting that theory.   urlLink Clinton Says Cultural Liberalism Loses Elections   And I quote...    Bill Clinton warned Senator John Kerry, presumptive Democrat presidential nominee, to counter Republican efforts to turn this year's election into a debate on gay marriage and other "cultural issues" such as gun control and abortion.   In an interview with the Financial Times, the former US president urged Senator Kerry to fight a values-based campaign focused on health, education and crime.   If he stayed on that ground, Mr. Kerry could win by "quite a nice margin".      Sheesh, ol' Slick Willy is making his secret I'm-Supporting-Bush agenda rather obvious, no? Obviously, even Clinton knows that it is on cultural issues such as abortion, gun control, and gay marriage where Democrats lose most of their support (which is probably why the Republicans have both the House and Senate under their control). Kerry would be good to heed Billy's advice, at this point...  What's next? Clinton wearing a Bush/Cheney '04 shirt? If only...

      Last Friday, the Senate began to deliberate on the need for an amendment defining marriage. The issue, which has incited heavy debate for the past year and half, was a touchy one between Democrats and Republicans within the Senate chamber. The Republicans, the ones pushing for the amendment, made it clear that this was no longer a state-oriented issue--that the specefics of the DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act--passed in the Senate in '96 with an 85-15 vote, and signed by President Clinton) were being challenged all around the nation because of lawsuits filed by gay couples who received marriage licenses outside of their home states. DOMA has been adopted by 40 states, which means those 40 states have the right to turn down and not recognize gay marriage licenses. Of course, activist judges say otherwise, declaring DOMA unconstitutional, in which states have to recognize those marriage licenses whether they want to or not.  Up step the Democrats to this fiery issue. While Republicans in the Senate chamber took their time to explain why such an amendment was neccessary, the Dems took their usual approach to the issue: avoid it, brush it aside, and change the subject. Throughout the entire three and half days of deliberation, only two Democratic senators actually addressed the issue: Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who made it clear he would only support an amendment if courts continue in their activist manners, and everyone's favorite liberal, Teddy Kennedy, who said he is outrightly against traditional marriage. All of the Democratic senators, most notably Dianne Feinstein (CA), Chris Dodd (CT), Barbara Boxer (CA), Frank Lautenberg (NJ), and Harry Reid (VT), among others, avoided the issue by saying the Republicans either a.) are full of hate and are trying to legislate their Nazi-esque agenda, or b.) are making this a national issue so they don't have to debate the economy or the current situation in Iraq.  I wrote a letter to one of my senators, Bill Nelson, a Democrat, who I thought would express the views of my state (predominantly Republican) rather well. I explained to him that his party needs to start addressing the issue, or they will simply lose trust among the 3/4 of Americans who are against gay marriage. Well, apparently he didn't listen to me--he voted against the amendment. And that's a problem when we have gays filing lawsuit in the Florida supreme court who want to be recognized as a married couple, even though this state has adopted DOMA unanimously through the state legislatures.  Well, to be honest, I find the performance of the Senate in their vote of 48-50 against the amendment rather disgusting. Here we are in the top level body of congress, debating whether or not we should protect an institution which has been the building block of this great society since day one--and we have Democrats saying we need to discuss a free-trade policy with the Australians? I'm sorry, but this issue isn't JUST about gays... it's about the American family. It's about the welfare of our culture and our children.  Gays are not bad people. I myself have an aunt who is a lesbian, and that has never at any time altered my opinion about her. I accept her as a person, however, that does not mean I condone her lifestyle. I am a Catholic, and I believe in accepting all--but I am not obligated to accept the way she lives... though make no mistake about it: she and every other gay person in America have the right to live their lives in absolutely any form or fashion they want. They have the right to pursue life, liberty, and happiness, as dictated by our Declaration. However, they DO NOT have the right to redefine a cultural, social and/or religious element as they see so fit to their needs.  It's like playing a board game and making the rules up as you go along. See, the gay community in this country has absolutely no qualms about bending, twisting, or altering laws and/or legal defintions  so long as it caters to their very own personal needs.  It would be like me as a Catholic going into a public school, and asking for the teacher to insert prayer time into the agenda so I could have my spiritual needs met--regardless of whether or not the class wanted to be subjected to it. Sorry, but no one should be able to do that. This is America, if the majority doesn't like it, then it's not going to fly.  I guarentee that if you go out and ask anyone between the ages of 13 and 30 what marriage means, they'll say something to the effect of "To affirm the love between two people." Well, I've got one word for that definition...  "Wrong."  Since when did marriage become some sort of social luxury for people who love eachother? It's not based all around pleasure... it's based around providing a safe, harmonious, and stable environment for a potential family. If two people get married, chances are, they're going to move into together if they haven't already... and what motivates them to do that? The marriage, of course. And studies have shown that to successfully raise a family with the highest potential, both a mother and father must be present, because each parent brings something different to the realm of rasing kids. I for one can vouch for this: I've learned things from my mother that I would have never learned from my father, and viceversa. My mother helped me out a lot with my schooling and social skills, while my father helped educate me on fixing things around the house--how to take care of things, so to speak. If I hadn't had both of them around, I have absolutely no clue what I would be like today. But I can assure you one thing--I would not nearly be as confident in myself if my father hadn't been around, and I wouldn't have been as academically determined if it weren't for my mother.  That's what makes me cringe when I hear "Marriage is all about love." Yes, I acknowledge, a component of marriage is love, but it is not the reason, nor the goal of it. If marriage were a car, "love" would be the fuel of that car, and the more love there is, the more efficiently a marriage functions. Marriage is about the 2 people who engage in it? How could anyone say that? Marriage is about  selflessness  not  selfishness.  Both parties are supposed to give as much as they can to one another, or the rest of the family, and the last priority should be themselves. A marriage is a lot like the concept of America: what you put into it is inevitably what you get out of it.  This is the prime reason this issue has sparked so much debate in the first place. We cannot allow, in any way, such a culturally concrete institution be jeopardized by dumbing down it's social significance. By allowing gays to marry, we simply shrug off marriage as another "thing." Well, according to Americans all around the country, marriage is not just a "thing," it's a serious issue which needs to be dealt with in an efficient manner, and according to the majority, must be protected, be it by local, state, or federal law.  I despise the notion that marriage is unimportant. It has been the most basic building block of society since ancient times, and to simply disregard and disrespect the impact it has made on civilizations, past and present, is what I call "social ignorance."  So until the federal legislatures decide they have time to concentrate on protecting the welfare of the American family, the lawsuits will continue, the activist judges will be free to legislate their agenda from the bench, and the Supreme Court will obtain many more steps towards declaring DOMA unconstitutional. And when they decide to confront the issue as they should have done yesterday, they will be forced to recognize that the majority of Americans  do not, and will not recognize marriage for gays.  And the only way to protect the people is with a constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman... and nothing else.

      After Martha Stewart's sentencing which took place yesterday,&nbsp;I have to say, I hate her even more than I did 72 hours ago. Why?&nbsp;   &nbsp;  This admittedly successful business woman gets sentenced to five months in jail after she knowingly lied to federal officials on as to why she dumped her ImClone stock... and what does she do afterwards? She has the audacity to come out and make a sales pitch in place of her "I'm Sorry" speech. Hmph.

      Before I begin, I'd just like to applaud Arnold for a job well done in socking it to those Democratic legislators out in Sacremento. First they try to bastardize your name, Arnold, then you poke fun at them by calling them "girlie men," and they want  you  to appologize? If you ask me, I think they need to be "Terminated."    But anyways... moving on...    In wars, we have heros, villains, neutrals, civilians, good guys, bad guys, etc... but also remember, every war has its fair share of selfish cowards.    The war we are fighting today is no exception to that.    So far, during the Iraq war, the list of "Hi! I'm a cowardly nation who gives into the feeble threats of barbaric terrorists!" has grown to three nations strong: Spain, El Salvador, and now most recently, the Philippines.      So why did they pull out? Let's see, I'll narrow it down to 3 possibilities for everyone (including the liberals who are reading this.):    a.) They love cheese.  b.) Allowing gays and lesbians to marry is more important.  c.) They are scared of faceless cowards who love to kill innocents.    If you answered "c" give yourself a pat on the back! If you answered either "a" or "b" please leave this blog immediately and go sky diving.  DO NOT  use a parachute. Thank you.    Moving on. The Philippines withdrew their entire 51-man force from Iraq over the weekend, and completed the withdrawl on Monday. Why did they do this? Because a Philippino truck driver was captured by some rag-tag band of terrorist thugs (most likely affiliated with our friend Abu Musab al-Zarqawi), who threatened to end his life (probably by decapitation--that seems to be a serious fad out in Iraq as of late) if the Philippino government didn't withdrawl its troops from Iraq. Of course, being the backstabbers they are, they high-tailed it out of Iraq like a bunch of Frenchmen... or as Arnold woul put it: "Girlie men."    So why should the US be angry about this? It's very simple. Whenever you give into a demand of someone or something, you feed that which demands it--you give it hope, you give it more resolve, and it boosts morale. In this case, the boosting of morale is taking place on the other side of the fence: apparently, it's a great time to be an Islamic Fundamentalist fighting jihad against the millions of Christian "infidels" and Jewish "invaders" (aka "Zionist Pigs") spread all across the world. For people who don't understand what I'm getting at, let me map out a more "American" scenario...     Billy the Bully: Hey there 4-eyes! Where are you going!      Hapless Harold: Uhh... I uhhh... am going to lunch.      Billy the Bully: Oh really? Want to do a favor for me?      Hapless Harold: Ummm      Billy the Bully: Of course you do! If you don't I'll bust your skull!      Hapless Harold: P-p-please Billy, I'll do whatever you want me to!!!      Billy the Bully: Go and buy me lunch.      Hapless Harold: But....      Billy the Bully: JUST DO IT!      Hapless Harold: Oh... oh ok... just don't hurt me!     Now see, if you were Billy in that instance, wouldn't you feel empowered with some sort of overwhelming control of your environment after you made poor Harold give into your demands? Yes, of course you would--it's human nature. And that's exactly what's going on in Iraq these days. The terrorists are winning the political war because we have a bunch of French-like allies backing out on us. What do we do? Simple. We boycott and cut off economic benefits with Spain, El Salvador, and the Philippines. The US is the most economically influential nation in the entire world... we can make or break the backs of ANYONE (with maybe the exception of China) just by changing our trade policies with any given country.    And I think that's what the US government should do. This is a war where there is no middle ground--an epic stuggle of good vs. evil. A massive battle to the death. You're either with us--or you're against us. Either way, it is the choice of those countries to decide that, but if they are against us, then they will parish just as swiftly at the tips of our blades as the fanatics of radical Islam do.    And we really can't have cheese-eating surrender monkeys like the Philippines compromising our mission because it's an inconvenience to them. Don't like the way we do things? Go and play a game of diplomatic grab-ass with the bloodsucking European Union--I'm sure they'll LOVE to have another pinch-hitter in their baseball game of collectivist multi-latteralism.    Oh and one last word to the Philippines... you're a bunch of girlie men.
