      Primo: numero uno.    This evening I watched  urlLink 'Pane e Tulipani'  , an Italian film.  There was an ad for it as part of a festival on  urlLink Radio One  in maybe 2001 or so, and it was voiced by a woman with a strong accent - it's on a tape I have of a show I did, so I heard it  over and over  again.  And now finally I see it!   It was a great film.  Even before I saw it I knew it was one of those 'self-discovery' type films, but really well done - lots of unexpected detail.  Afterwards I had to go to a friends to drop something off.  It was cold and rainy outside, I figured I'd just be there and back, as I knew she wasn't going to be there.  Upon arriving, I found a group of half a dozen strangers in the lounge (I don't visit very often).  I said hi, and they invited me to join them for a beer.    It became one of those situations that I feel like used to happen all the time when I was at high school, and I'd go to parties where everyone was friendly and curious, and instant friendships would spring up.  I guess I still get it nowadays at parties; but it's so much rarer.  On the walk I listened to (what I affectionately call) my 'flying nun +' md.  It features     - the  urlLink Topless Women Talk About Their Lives  soundtrack - the  urlLink Scarfies  soundtrack -  urlLink Age Pryor - City Chorus  -  urlLink JPS Experience - Bleeding Star  -  urlLink the Phoenix Foundation - Horsepower  -  urlLink Volume  - a Wellington compilation  The JPSE songs were the best this evening.  I'm so glad that it's Friday.  Can't relax too much this weekend though: got to write up my interview with the  urlLink Accelerants ,  urlLink deadline  is next Tuesday.

         I got a backyard  with nothing in it  except a stick  a dog and  a box with something in it       Totally dig that line.    I had an intense crush on the White Stripes; and I imagine it'll re-establish itself once they release another album. That's okay. The best thing about the White Stripes (and the Flaming Lips) is that their songs are so easy to play.   It's not really May 29; it's actually July 30. But it only just occurred to me that that line, which I have reproduced on my wall in block letters, is really the way I should have begun.

       urlLink   Finally, a  urlLink Hot Swiss Mistress  gig.  They haven't played since a gig at the Cross on the 21st of May, the same night as the  urlLink Paselode  album launch.   Quite  a fun night.  Anyway, to make up for the long absence, there's two gigs this week: this one at Indigo on Tuesday and one on Friday at the Cross with Marineville.  I hate to say it but there'll probably be another long absence... Rhys is pretty busy right now with Paselode gigs every other weekend.    The good news is that any minute now  urlLink Hot Swiss Mistress  will be recording, and we hope, releasing at least one track to the general populace.  (Goes into extreme wishful thinking mode...) We hope to sort out a bit of a tour down south later in the year and for sure sort out some more gigs in Auckland.

      Last night I went to the 48 hour film contest finals.  It was sold out, packed to the last seat with crew and supporters.  My favourite and the eventual winner was  Heinous Crime  by Taika Cohen and (I think it's) Loren Horsley.  Taika is so funny.  Next best and even better in some ways was  How To Deal with the Situation  - absolute classic featuring Richard Falkner with a rather distinguished face of hair.  Third place was  Nice n' Easy  with a detective theme.  Might go check out the Auckland finalists this afternoon.  I see on the  urlLink 48 hours site  that Aucklanders can view the Welli finals on July 4 at the Classic Comedy Club.  If you're even mildly interested you should definitely check it out.  Disturbingly quiet weekend in terms of movie entertainment rather than live and electric.  Did manage to get reasonably drunk at the  urlLink Paramount  though.  Listening to  urlLink Elastica   urlLink Elastica ,  urlLink JPS Experience   urlLink Bleeding Star  (JPSE are  so  great) and  urlLink A Low Hum CD 2  (now available on  urlLink smoke cds) .

      Wednesday night, Happy, an expectant crowd gathers. I discover that it  is  true - without any smoking inside, you can smell people's farts! Haha. First act Golden Axe were way cool, setting up just in front of the stage. One operated a modified pram (complete with revolving mini disco ball, reminded me of a lollipop) the other was on a souped-up zimmer frame. Fantastic. The lights were the best! They had crazy outfits too, ridiculous convoluted headgear which added to the overall effect. I liked it when they appeared to talk to each other between songs and it sounded like a de-tuned radio. I've just been checking out their track 'No Food' on the  urlLink A Low Hum CD 3 , and it's great.   urlLink Disasteradio  was fantastic as always, distributing cd-rs of 'Dance Self Instruction Record' and 'The System That Never Fails'. Cher Luke! He's such a happy fellow.   urlLink The Fanatics  played last. Finally I got to see them after two false starts (I missed them at Indigo and at Bodega earlier this year). Singer David seemed kind of angsty, strutting jerkily about the stage a bit like some other Auckland band's singer. It was a little strange how the bar man confiscated the mic stand that was being kicked around the stage, but I have to admit to feeling a little nervous when he was waving the stool around. Although again it seemed unnecessary for the barman to remove it! Surely David wasn't all that unpredictable. I talked to him afterwards, and he was lovely.  All in all a good gig. In other news I met  urlLink Noizyboy  at last! Hurrah! Samflux too. And tclak. Fun times.  This Saturday is Designated Dump Day. Not just us - the boys up the road are doing it too, so it must be cool!! Next weekend the hunt for a new flat begins.

       urlLink   This took me ages.  Not the picture just getting the sizing right and the alignment.  I gotta credit  urlLink Supergood  for helping me and also  urlLink Noizyboy  for helping me figure out text wrap.  You're all very nice people whom I've never met.  My hair isn't really all that stringy, but there's no option for my sleek do and I'm too lazy to figure out how to recreate it with Paint or something.  Yeah, okay, it's really nothing like me apart from I own a red shirt, black pants and glasses.  Ah well.  Just wanted to show it off I guess...    Hooray -  urlLink Disasteradio  and  urlLink the Fanatics  tonight at Happy!

      I've got good intentions of seeing  Voodoo Savage and His Savages  tonight at Indigo, but knowing me and my habits of late I may not be able to hang in there.  I didn't manage it last week for All the Pretty Horses... but I  will  be there next week to catch  urlLink Hot Swiss Mistress .  They've got three new songs!!  (Dunno if they'll play 'em all though. I'll post the flyer a bit closer to the day.)  Anyway, I hear it's the Savages' second-to-last gig before their bass player Dain moves to Japan.  Awww...  Makes my resolve to avoid an early night a little stronger.  Last night I found myself in front of the tv during American Idol.  (I was ironing.  Ugh.  I hardly ever do ironing, but it doubles my work wardrobe when I do.)  To my shock I saw Quentin Tarantino is one of the judges!!  It transpired that a discussion had already gone down earlier in my flat as to whether Mr T has "sold out" or not.  I dunno... but I'm not terribly impressed.

      I'm feeling kind of sick, so I can't possibly spend my lunch break reading important newsletters as planned.  Instead idle exploration of links on  urlLink noizyblog  took me  urlLink here .  The 'Which archangel are you?' quiz seemed like good lunchtime entertainment - here's the result:   Gabriel.  You're most like the ArchAngel of Communication, in charge of things like telephones, libraries, internet, and the 411 phone menu.  You're organised and are not shy about inflicting that organisation on others.     urlLink   Which ArchAngel are you most like?    Seems accurate enough, although I'm not sure what '411 phone menus' are.  The organisation part is true... Gabriel's pretty hot, huh.  Thanks  urlLink David , now I have soft porn images to keep my visitors amused.  Mondays are such a drag.  I think that a strict regime of peppermint lip balm and cups of green tea will get me through it.

      Last night I went to a cocktail party.  Flash huh.  A table covered in bottles of this and that, bowls of cherries, strawberries toothpicks and little paper umbrellas, right beside a table of music.  And weren't we well-behaved!    Jolene made afghans.  They were great.  People should do baking more often.  Cher Jo!  I have just been looking at  urlLink this  site, referred by jet @  urlLink nzmusic .  It's a bit spooky.  I'd never really thought about 'relevant ads' before, although I had wondered about the ads at the top of this page seeming to reflect keywords of earlier topics.  I dunno though; I usually ignore ads as far as I can tell.  Wonder what'll be deduced from my flatmate's baking.  What's more spooky, of course, is the storage capacity of the mail system in question, and the potential for horrible abuse by the creators.  I guess I could start being (even more) cryptic and not really state what it is that I'm talking about... I'm pretty good at that.  May lessen readability.  Here's my first attempt:  Spent some time up the road.  Hung out, did some stuff, same as the other day.  Talked to some people.  Got some food, and picked up some stuff from a place in town.  Stuff looked good.  Some people went to get something to look at, brought back some titles not to my liking so I moved on.  Am pretty tired. All pretty vague and noncommittal, yes?  Perfect.  Give me a relevant ad for that, I challenge you!  But I do want to make the occasional owning statement.  Last night and today I spent some time playing guitar, and I'm pleased that my wrist is feeling heaps better which helps with the barre chords.  I made up a song, but I'm not sure if I didn't just transpose someone else's...

      Apparently the sore wrist I've had on and off for the last five years now has a name.  It's a ganglion.  Pronounced "gang-glee-on", not "gang-lion" which could be cooler.  I've got anti-inflammatories to try out for now.  The sooner it gets better the less excuse I'll have for not practising guitar ever.  Last night I had dinner at Geoff's - fantastic curry, cher bo!  Then we braved the chill and found our way down the hillside without assing over to go to Indigo.  The Timeless Sounds!  They were cool.  Special mention to the accordion player, is it Kristen from Dress?  I think so.  Anyway, they wove a glorious cloth of bluesy rhythmic kinda gypsy Tom Waits folk sound.  (Thanks Warner for the adjectives).  The Shallows were visiting from Auckland, and they played well too.  Two guitars, a stripped back drumkit and a keyboard supplying a bassy organ sound.  Pretty loose, pretty tight, sounded good to me.  The Users played next but didn't catch much of their set.

      I thought I could do it, but it would seem that I can't.  In hindsight, the fact that I couldn't bring myself to do it in person, and instead had to do it by mailorder - that should have indicated that I'm just not ready.  I tried, but I've failed.  Maybe they'll suit  urlLink you ?  Last night I went to Indigo to see  urlLink All the Pretty Horses , but Indigo being Indigo there was no sign of the band starting at 10:45, so I bailed.  I am disappointed, as they  urlLink sound  like an interesting act and not one that I will see again.  I was impressed by the amount of merchandise on sale - a range of cds, badges, patches, t-shirts, dvds, even fridge magnets!  One other thing.  This morning on National Radio I heard Don Brash stating in relation to the prohibition on nuclear ships entering our waters that if elected, National "will not make any change in policy without a referendum".  The  urlLink angle  is that they'll change the  law , but not the  policy .  How flakey is that?!  And as for not making it an election issue - what a surprise.

      Last night I attended something of a reunion with five friends from high school - Letitia, Evania, Jane, Ange and Little Lis'.  In spite of my initial trepidation, the evening was most enjoyable.  Not surprisingly, we talked about school, but we also talked about now, and it was interesting to hear what people do and make the connections.  I don't think I completely recognised the friends I used to have.  I am unable to feel sentimental about this.  Lisa brought out a book we had all written in aged 13 and 14 - now  that  was weird - a chronicle of the excitements and concerns of our fourth form lives.  I did not recognise myself either.  It was a time of such innocence but we were all in such a rush to lose it.  And lose it we did.  There are some things in my life that I have no desire to recall, but at the same time they define me and the reality of my past has bearing on every aspect of my now.  But on what level?  If I am not aware of it, does it make a difference?  One thing that was reinforced yet again is the black hole nature of my memory.  I was disappointed that I often had no recollection of stories and incidents that were discussed.  That's obviously what years of substance abuse does to one.  I've been told that once you stop, your memory returns.  I guess it will take a while, but I hope it's true - ultimately I choose to remember the good with the bad.  [Disclaimer: I do not abuse substances.]  Today in a shop window I caught sight of a magazine cover with Ronald Reagan smiling out.  I know next to nothing about this late ex president.  I wondered what untold impact his government's policies had and continue to have on my life.  I draw a blank.

        "Memory always obeys the commands of the heart." Antoine Rivarol  This evening I  urlLink saw  'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.  It was  urlLink great .  Jim Carrey has totally won me over.  Seeing him in  urlLink 'The Truman Show'  did a lot to redeem such appearances as 'Liar Liar', 'Ace Ventura' and 'Dumb and Dumber', and recently I saw  urlLink 'Man on the Moon'  which I really liked.  But the role of Joel Barish in 'Eternal Sunshine' is the best so far.  Kate Winslet does superbly too.  Charlie Kaufman has outdone himself with this screenplay, and I didn't think that  urlLink 'Being John Malkovich'  could be topped!  Going by the cool factor of his music videos (eg.  urlLink the White Stripes  - my fave song), director  urlLink Michel Gondry  (interview  urlLink here  also features Charlie Kaufman) is an excellent collaborator.  It looks at the idea of  urlLink memory erasure , and whether it's better to keep hold of memories that cause us pain but ultimately enrich our experience.  It's named after a poem by  urlLink Alexander Pope :   'How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.' What a line.  It's beautiful and inspiring.  I'm not going to talk about the movie any more because it's one that should be viewed without preconceptions.  Also, it's late and I'm not up to intelligent analysis.  But I do want to say that the film really appealed to me as a romantic.  All I can do is say 'Awwww'.  I took a  urlLink quiz  to see if I would benefit from memory erasure.  Apparently I'm a prime candidate.  I gotta say though how can you have  urlLink testimonials  to a procedure that by definition erases memory of its occurrence?  On the movie's official site, I made it though the memory match game, and it played a weird trailer/music video... I guess there had to be some kind of reward - but it was pretty strange, all cgi-ed mouths.  Check it out.  My flatmate Nick is entering the  urlLink 48 hours  movie contest.  He's the editor.  The creative minds are busy writing the story and script tonight, they'll film tomorrow, and he will do the editing tomorrow night.  We talked this evening about what makes a good movie.  "A beginning, a middle and an end," said Nick.  "Conflict and resolution," said Amelia.  Off on a tangent, I contributed, "It's got to end with a hug and a lecture."  Gah, to think that 'Full House' has me brainwashed to this day.  *Marcus Tullius Cicero

      At work today my boss gave me another 'Sometimes you really scare me Jessie' speech.  Just because I couldn't pronounce interlocutory, as in  urlLink interlocutory application .  (For the record, it's inter-lock-utory, with the stress on 'lock').  I told him he just has to have faith in me.    He's a cool boss.

      Hanging washing. Such a mundane task.  Having to stand out in the cold dark yard straining up to a crowded clothesline is out of the question.  Instead I take my milk-box of clothes from the washing machine, which is conveniently located in the kitchen, doubling the available bench space in fact.  I toil up the stairs, pull the drying rack out from against the wall under the window, put the stereo on (revisiting  urlLink Superette 's Rosepig, a fantastic EP - dark and moody but still guitar pop) and yeah, the computer too - look at that, the washing's forgotten already, just like the sheets that will have to sit in a damp pile because a freak rainshower has just hit and there's no way I'm going outside again tonight... Although I did have intentions to go see  urlLink Die!Die!Die!  at the Cross.  They're playing with three other bands, which further increases the likelihood that I wouldn't see DDD cos it's the Cross and nothing will start until probably 11pm.  And wasn't I going to the dairy to buy lollies?  Yeah.  Ah, pixie caramel and giant pebbles.    I've been reading a few other blogs lately, and a few people have been blogging about blogging.  ( urlLink Here  and  urlLink here .)  And here I am writing posts on how I feel about hanging my washing.  It's The Backyard!  I make no claims of greatness, this is unlikely to ever be a blog where high-minded ideas are analysed.  Oh, I'll attempt it - but the real pearls are in the everyday observations.  I'm convinced of it.    Have had a text from my flatmate Nick.   urlLink Disasteradio  is playing at the Cross right now.  It's stopped raining - I'm outta here.

      Cher to Mary McNaught for the cake.    I was itching to get back to Welli so I had just one quick stop off at Waikawa Beach to visit Jane who was getting some long weekend r'n'r with some friends.  Soundtrack: Paselode's new album The Taming of the Wasps (would link to my review in the Package but they've moved it.. ah well),  urlLink the Hill is Alive , the Video Kid and Green Room:  urlLink Eco-Nation  which includes a current favourite: Bag of Money by Barnaby Weir (mp3 sample  urlLink here ).  Back in Welli now.  Spent the afternoon relocating Van and catching up on  urlLink Paselode 's recent antics.

      On Sunday we set off south via 'Surf Highway' (SH45), around the coast instead of cutting down through Stratford.  Really windy - poor Van nearly got blown off the road.  Stopoffs in Opunake and Waverley where we found our old schoolfriend Letitia pumping petrol (she's studying midwifery in Palmerston North).  On to Wanganui, where not-so-cher Dad had locked me out of the house.  Luckily we found Denford and Ben doing some glass-blowing at the polytech, and luckier still managed to locate a television (thanks Damon!) to watch  urlLink Squeeze : first Booga Beazley interview in a million years or something.  It was superb.  Big ups  urlLink Jane .    We realise that Libby knows Brad Pitt by only two degrees of separation, cos she used to make coffee for Eric Bana (who plays  urlLink Hector  prince of Troy) at a cafe in Hampton, Melbourne.  That means that  I know him by three degrees!!   We drive back to Ohingaiti for the night.  I watched the Sunday Lexus Theatre 'Sunday (Bloody Sunday)', quite frustrating viewing with the English soldiers depicted as brutal and shooting at anything that moves.

      I spent the night in Ohingaiti courtesy of Bridget, Nathan, Felicity and Freddy.  Libby and I set off on Saturday morning for  urlLink New Plymouth .  The weather was pretty bad but from inside the Van I didn't mind.  Soundtrack: the  urlLink Black Seeds - On the Sun ,  urlLink Whopper Chopper , and Green Room:  urlLink Wahine .  We stopped by Wanganui to say hi to my dad, who hooked us up with some NP info.  Cher Dad.  Continued on up  urlLink map 5  of the AA Road Atlas.  Got into NP about 1:30 and found ourselves a backpackers (Central City Lodge on Leach St, no complaints).  Then we went to the  urlLink Govett-Brewster .  The  urlLink Mediarena  exhibition was fantastic.  We loved the 'karaoke room' - designed to give the everyday person an insight into the experience of a rock star.  Perfect.  Also liked the paintings commenting on woman's role in society (girl on leash with severed limbs juxtaposed with traditional backgrounds of snow, cherry blossoms and full moon) and the paintings commenting on genetic engineering.  Altogether the exhibition was completely worth the journey.  Afterwards we attempted the Puke Ariki museum but only got as far as the cafe - we had reached cultural saturation point.  Curry for dinner then we indulged ourselves:  urlLink 'Troy' .  I'm not usually a big fan but you'd have to be inhuman not to find Brad Pitt waaay hot!  During dinner I had explained the  urlLink story of the Trojan war  to Libby, but we found that much of my version was omitted, I suppose understandably, since I like to start the story at the wedding where goddess of discord,  urlLink Eris , throws a golden apple inscribed 'for the fairest' amongst the guests.  This sparks off the beauty contest, where Paris is chosen as judge, and the goddess entrants offer him bribes - with the offer of the love of the fairest woman (Helen) winning.  Made me want to read the  urlLink Aeneid  again... unlikely though.  The urge lasted as long as wanting to re-read the Lord of the Rings after seeing each movie of the trilogy.

      I managed to leave Wellington by about 6:30.  No traffic issues, made it to Otaki in good time to visit my brother Guy.  The Van has a strong safety first attitude - unlike other vehicles with pleasant 'dingdong' tones once you hit 110, the instant you drift up to 105 the Van emits the most hideous squawk.  Imagine the most obnoxious alarm clock crossed with a very angry duck.  A very effective speed-deterrent.  In spite of lacking somewhat in the physics of hugging, Guy earns the best brother ever medal for supplying me with a car converter for my md player, allowing me to leave my Portishead tape in the glovebox for the remainder of the trip.  Soundtrack for the journey north: 'alt rock plus' (another not-terribly-accurate title): featuring  urlLink Calexico ,  urlLink the Phoenix Foundation - Horsepower ( urlLink these words  as true now as they were when I wrote them last year),  urlLink Cassette ,  urlLink the Flaming Lips - Yoshimi/Ego Tripping ,  urlLink Grandaddy - Sumday ,  urlLink Age Pryor , the  urlLink Video Kid - Prototype , and a few other favourites from  urlLink Flash Harry ,  urlLink Dinosaur Jr , and even a rare live recording of  urlLink Hot Swiss Mistress  (my favourite, if I had to choose one: the Method of Being a Happy Man).

      More additions... a sitemeter!  Essential for sure.  Especially now that James  urlLink Noizyboy  has kindly given me a link on his blog!    I had to catch a bus this morning: there was one of those annoying  smiling  people on it.  You know when you see strangers just smiling for no apparent reason?  Sometimes they have the kind of smile that makes me smile too (at least I hope when I'm in a smiling-at-the-world mood it tends to increase the average happiness on earth).  But other times (I grudgingly admit this could be dependent on my oh-so-stable moods) a stranger's smile - especially at nothing in particular - can really irritate me.    Hell is other people, huh.  A cursory google brought up this  urlLink quiz .  Apparently this is me:    "You're the cheerful smile,the one that's truly happy with almost everything you do and would never change your life."  Ah, whatever.

      It's Queen's Birthday weekend.  Do I care?  Not really - not beyond the fact that I get an extra day off work.  Hooray!  A friend who's  urlLink band  is performing in Australia at the moment has lent me his van (all I had to do was collect it from its park in Holloway Rd - we both live in Mt Vic -  and renew the registration) so tonight I'm hitting the road and heading for Hunterville to collect my friend Libby.  Tomorrow we'll drive to New Plymouth via Wanganui to have a look at the  urlLink Mediarena  exhibition at the Govett-Brewster gallery.  Have been spending hours of fun figuring out how this blog thing works and checking out other people's blogs, mostly using the  urlLink 'kiwi blogs'  link that you'll see on the right of this post.  I am trying out the 'babelfish' translator (seemed like a good idea) and one or two other things.   It's really windy and rainy today and I don't want to go outside but I have to retrieve my hairdrier from my neighbour's house...

      Back to the land of the living.  You know when you wake up at 3:30am, if you look at your clock to check the time, and it's 3:30am, it's like the kiss of death?  Once I know that it's  that  time, it's like there's no way I can get back to sleep inside of about two hours.    To make matters worse, I had been reading an anthology of  urlLink American Splendour .  I saw the movie a few weeks ago (there's a good review of it  urlLink here ).  It produced crazed dreams where every detail of every thought had to be translated into comic form... not very relaxing.  But then, Harvey Pekar wasn't a very relaxed guy.    I had planned to make my return to work on time, but when I 'woke' up at 8am with a sharp pointy headache I knew it wasn't going to happen.  A couple of extra-strength painkillers later, without managing to get back to sleep - I eventually floated into work about 11am.  It took hours for my brain to get earthed!!  Tonight I finished my Accelerants  urlLink article .  Excellent.

      Where did time go?  I've been laid up in bed with a nasty flu the last few days, and time is warping on me.  Spent about five minutes trying to figure out what day it is, before I realised that the date was set wrong on my cellphone.  Two days off work... I better go in tomorrow, pretty sure I don't get sick pay yet since I've only been there two and a half months.  Besides coming down with this flu on Sunday, the weekend was pretty cool.  I spent Saturday sifting Cuba St, bought the new  urlLink Staple  magazine.  I was surprised to see my brother's band Hawaiian Death Club mentioned in a story on  urlLink www.nzmusic.com .    On Saturday night I went to the Law Revue.  It was at Memorial Theatre at Victoria University.  The humour of it was not really my scene - it being largely aimed at a) lawyers who b) work for big corporates.  Particular moment of discomfort: "I Let a Law Clerk Go Down on Me" to the tune of "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me".  Eee...  That said, it was an impressive production and it was great to see people I know (especially my friend Jane) doing their thing on stage.  Highlight was the pisstake on 'I'm an Asshole' rendered by an apoplectic and potty-mouthed judge ('I'm an Activist').  Caught a bit of TV2's  urlLink National Anthem , good to see.  Then I went to  urlLink Bodega  for 'Trashed' - 13 acts on two stages.  I got there just in time to see the Accelerants, who were great.  As were Mr Slackjaw (the infamous Andrew Tolley) and Voodoo Savage and His Savages.

      If I had time to write a post, there are some things I would like to talk about. I'd like to write about how great the Brunettes gig was on Saturday at Bodega (Hot Swiss were excellent). I'd like to say how I enjoyed meeting  urlLink Joanna,  and how Matthew far exceeded my expectations. If I had time, I'd say how I dashed between bars and managed to catch part of Paselode's set, which was  rockin'  - the boys were in fine form!! I'd say a  big thank you  to Nato for getting Rhys back to Wellington with loads of time to spare, and for being so gracious about it. New friend Michael from Kentucky would get a mention; so would Silas. Sunday would rate as far as being a stunning day goes, although yet again my head was hanging out far above the surface of the earth where my body lagged a little. Who could blame me for rash behaviour?    I might write about how I went to my first film festival movie:  urlLink Animation Now!  which to be honest does not deserve the exclamation mark. I thought it fell short of the last few years' collections. It may have been my hangover, but there were too many abstract jumpy weird-ass animations for my liking. I could say how I was supposed to go to the Kotahitanga gig at Indigo, but I was too tired so I only went  home  to Georgie's where I was fed (thanks Ness!) and finally saw 'Whale Rider'. (It was okay.)   I might even go on and write about how Monday was such a drag; how I bought tickets for the  urlLink Spike Jonze Rarities  film, and tried to cope with the choices before me at Subway. I miss Sandwich King. (Anyone from Dunedin? SK is far superior: they have whole grain mustard!! It used to get all stuck in my braces but I ate it anyway...)   And today:  urlLink Hot Swiss Mistress  were fantastic on Good Morning! If anyone wants to see it, and I actually know you and won't be weirded out, e-mail me (there's a link on the sidebar) and we'll arrange a Viewing.   Finally, if I had a spare moment I'd direct your attention to the link in the sidebar called  urlLink Rådhuspladsen,  which takes you to a webcam view over the Town Hall Square in København. This view was a deciding factor in my choice to spend six months in wonderful Copenhagen a few years back. Today when I looked at it the sun was just beginning to rise, and it took me back to those short short summer nights when the sun would never really go down, and the true darkness of night lasted only an hour or so, with a band of light always to the east. (Feel free to rain on my parade and tell me the sun would have been in the west.) Going to bed around 2am the birds would already be singing... and I always wondered, when do they sleep?

      I really struggle to think of post titles.   Things that I dislike:   1. The vibration that shocks through the house when the front door gets slammed 2. Ordering CDs online and being told that one isn't available ever anymore and I  used to own it  but I had to return it to the publication I reviewed it for 3. Having to return review CDs to the publication I review them for 4. Getting up in the middle of the night to get a glass of water and weaving all over my room before finding the door   Things I like:   1. The weekend  2. Experiencing stadium atmosphere at Indigo without feeling compelled to be crushed and sweated on at the front 3. Trumpet stabs, saxophone and trombone, synchronicity 4. Waking up and not being hungover 5. Looking forward to having a gig tonight!    Last night began with sitting in the lounge, sated by chicken masala, alternately sipping beer and tea and eating copious amounts of chocolate given to me by an excessively generous work colleague.  Listening to metal.  Nick insists that it isn't metal; but what else could you label those insane riffs and searing vocals??  It was called Alexis Redhead or something...  Again I pressed him to check out  urlLink Dragonforce .  I'm sure he'd love them, he just doesn't like to admit to it.  We buzzed out on  urlLink Franz Ferdinand's  'Shopping For Blood' and again I wished there was a Wellington concert.  Reminds me of Iggy Pop, Joy Division, QOTSA... I'm a little behind the times, living in my wee nzmusic-orientated world - must buy the album.  I have been on a roll with new music, buying up large.  It's great... this week's purchase is the Shocking Pinks 'Dance the Dance Electric'.  It's one I turned down for review months ago, thinking I lacked the context to be objective.  And now I get to listen in leisure.  The best way.  I also tried to get  urlLink the Coolies , since I only have it on dirty realplayer (which won't translate to iTunes) after having to give it back, post- urlLink review , but it's proving difficult to locate.  God forbid that I should actually have to go to a record store...  The Scribes of Ra were cool last night!  I love seeing the way they communicate on stage.   urlLink The Black Seeds  were on form, nice lengthy encore set too. Sell out crowd.  They're off to Singapore next week!  Nice one boys.  Andy Flyboy was dropping the funky beats at Good Luck too, excellent to catch up.  According to Nick the Mint Chicks gig was all good: he said Pussy Glitch were great too, with out-of-tune guitar and everything wired through a synth.  The other night on the Simpsons Lisa made the comment to the effect that popular music serves to distract people from taking an interest in politics.  My consciousness is chiefly filled by interests, cares and concerns all entrenched in the music industry, whether it be the band I manage, friends' bands, popular music (by which I mean what is commonly referred to as 'alternative'), what's being played, who's playing it, how it affects me and how I access it.  It's easy to get caught up.  I put a huge amount of my productivity into achieving goals within the music industry, productivity that potentially could be used towards political ends.  But it's where my heart is.    That said, I appreciate the perspective that Lisa's comment gives.  This week's work-induced revelation: I need to learn how to  think .

      Pro Drag were wicked last night.  Boss Christ is the coolest drummer ever!!  Ace Hurt thought there wasn't enough distortion, but it sounded pretty grunted up to me.    I'd like to see them supporting MC5 on August 3, but I hear the tickets are circa $50 and seeing as I've got my Auckland adventure that weekend, it probably won't happen.   Speaking of which, the lineups are  finally  almost finalised.   We're   urlLink They're  playing with Chris Knox!! at the Ambassador on Friday 6 August.  On Saturday 7 August at Eden's the bill includes the Shallows!  We're so spoiled...  Besides potentially missing MC5, I'll almost definitely have to miss  urlLink Fly My Pretties , which runs from Aug 4-8 at  urlLink Bats.   It sounds really interesting so I'm disappointed.  Lucky for me it's being recorded  and  filmed.

      A winning weekend.  Friday night's party was cool, although I didn't get there until after the Savages had played.  Somehow spent my evening at the 'ho: that never happens so it was great fun in its novelty.  Met some lovely people too, thanks o facilitator Tara.   Saturday was exhausting so my night began with a nap.  Normally I have misgivings about day time sleeping as it seems particularly difficult to pick up one's game in the aftermath.  It still took me four tracks of  urlLink SJD  to wake up.  The evening, like the day, was cold, rainy and generally uninviting.  That's why it was such an achievement for me to get dressed, sort my shit out and catch a bus  on my own  out to Island Bay.  I knew it would be an adventure.  It so was.  There was much fun to be had, many friends to meet and much stimulating conversation to be made.  The Inkling were excellent, as was 50Hz.  G and M had the dancefloor APPLAUDING at their tracks; now that's impressive!  (Especially that Sal Dub track, and Fat Freddy's  Midnight Marauders,  mmmm.)  We stopped by the dress-up party at the factory on the way into town and then hit the boards at Indigo where Knixx was dropping the killer tracks and everyone was happy.   Ohhh, late night.  Sunday was fairly non-existent as far as my head being out of the clouds goes. I managed to leave the house while the sun was still shining, with vague ideas of being in it, but I only got as far as Georgie's for a post-evening debrief.  The sun was still up when I left, and I had further vague ideas of ascending Mt Victoria if only to bask in its dying rays, but common sense prevailed and instead I went and had a coffee.  Cher Stacey.  Thanks for listening to my ranting of good times without your eyes visibly glazing over.  I think an expos&#233 on the Politics of Attraction is in order...  I had my biggest test still ahead of me.  Supermarket shopping.  My flat operates on a five week turnaround of duties, some of which are better observed than others, with easily measurable tasks like putting out the rubbish and doing the flat shopping ahead of the list.  When I arrived at the Wakefield St New World I was still coping with concepts of being alive and upright.  In fact, at first, it felt like a party.  Unfortunately as I got to aisle number two the picture began to fade. Sepia tones were creeping into my reality and black and white threatened to switch to black.  I hit the wall.  Knuckles whitening as I gripped the trolley, I grimly endured the circuit, inwardly groaning at the congestion down the canned-food-and-pasta aisle, stunned at the crowd gathered beside the pre-sliced deli meats.  The worst came when I was safely ensconced beside the magazines, a pocket of calm where usually I would while away a good half hour browsing the stand.  Not today; reading was beyond my capability.  Instead I took the opportunity to check the list.  Now, some people refer to their shopping lists as they shop.  I'm not a believer.  Instead I prefer to go by my instinct and then check how I've done after the fact. The news was not good; I had forgotten bananas.  It was like having to go back to the first row in a game of snakes and ladders.  I weighed it up: the wrath of my flatmates over my legitmate excuse of being close to death - death in a supermarket, reminds me of  urlLink Noah's Toilet  by Coldcut - better just to get the bananas and make it out alive.  The taxi took ages, when I finally got home it was all I could do to climb the stairs. I crashed out as soon as I had located some panadol (only took two calls to flatmates). Cher guys.  urlLink Supermarkets,  huh. Which brings me to  urlLink this.  So true.   Like  urlLink Tam,  I'm unsure about the  urlLink new blogger editor.    No doubt having the text colour chart will lead to some oh so pretty! entries though...  s  t  a  n  d   b  y .

      Wait for it - just about... Ah! Friday Euphoria! Oh, how I love thee Friday. What a hellish week. Band projects have been spiralling and cumulating into enormous tangled knots, work has thrown up all manner of seemingly impregnable problems, and my health is suffering.... ah, did I mention my fondness for melodrama? At least as far as the  urlLink band  goes, I have only to remind myself that  I am having fun: this is fun!  And it  is  coming together.   But work is another story. Last night I had a Rejection-themed dream in which I lost my job, amongst other forms of rejection which need not be explored here. You see, yesterday I Broke an Ethical Rule. Ah, that sinking feeling of having screwed up and yet again given my boss reason to doubt not only my intelligence but also my understanding of basic ethical principles... Lucky for me it was but a minor transgression and easily resolved.    But it's Friday so I need not think of such things. Tonight I'm going to a party to witness Voodoo Savage and his Savages play their actual last ever gig. Should be good times. And tomorrow there's a mid winter party at Island Bay Studios. Destination Moon!   The title of this post refers to a book called  urlLink 'Creating Heat: Tumata Kia Whita!'  which I received in the mail today. It outlines 'a strategy to ignite the economic and cultural potential of the New Zealand music industry'. Now I have two copies. Great ... how much do they spend on these things anyway? Why did I get one?? Although it does make me feel slightly special, as if my thoughts are valued on this topic... must try and get beyond the amusing first page story about Moana Maniapoto in Detroit being blown away by "an all black congretation [singing] gospel songs with great passion and in voices from heaven itself" and then freaking out about having to perform for the said congregation. The punchline is that her waiata caused one onlooker to comment:  "I didn't know what she was saying but it made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck." Apparently,  "This is what our music does." (Read more about the strategy  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .)   It's stuff like this that makes me determined to survive the next two years plus of my job. I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel and I'm lucky to be firmly walking the path I set myself. After weeks like this one - and I know there are many more tests ahead - I need the encouragement.   PS Ahahaa just heard an ad on Active for  Rapture Gold!!  (Exclamation marks compulsory). Tempting nonetheless...   PPS Fuckin' fantastic Friday playlist... aka  friday euphoria on friday :  Mazurra:&nbsp;Calexico (Spoke)  Summer Babe (Winter Version): Pavement (Slanted &amp; Enchanted)  I Love Lo Fi: Flash Harry (Flash Harry)  Models: The Fanatics (A Low Hum 8)  Octagon, Octagon, Octagon: Mint Chicks (Octagon, Octagon, Octagon)  Sputnik: Dappled Cities Fly (A Low Hum 8)  Nothing To Do: Cassette (Emo)  All The Pretty Horses: Calexico (Aerocalexico)  Bag Of Money: Barnaby (Eco Nation)  Helpless: Faith No More (Album Of The Year)  Crack Dub: Hallelujah Picassos (Hateman In Love)  The Place is Surrounded: SJD (Southern Lights)  Light: Cornerstone Roots (Soul Revolution)  Soy La Candela: Sabor (Jambalaya 2004))  Slowpoke: Phelps &amp; Munro (Slowpoke)  Knives Out: The Flaming Lips (Fight Test EP)  Lazy Calm: Cocteau Twins (Sunday Best 3)  Preachin' To My Baby: The Artistry (Grey Lynn Park Festival Compilation)  Broken Bricks: The White Stripes The White Stripes)  Senegal Champions of Africa: The Black Seeds On the Sun)

      "Seven deep breaths will solve any problem."  She told me it was a Samurai saying.  I can't even remember what it was that I was stressed about; I was sitting in the  urlLink Moonfisher Cafe  at  urlLink Christiania  at the time, so it was probably to do with my lost credit card and subsequent six weeks without money.  ...   I am trying to take seven deep breaths, but I keep losing count as the enormity of the petty tasks before me closes in.  It's twenty to six and I want to go home; but I have stacks of paperwork to get through and freaking out about it isn't helping any!  (Nor is spending time blogging - but taking the time out helps.)  Aside from that, if anyone can tell me how to make characters like the 'o' with a line through it, or the 'a' with a circle above it, I would find it easier to write Danish words.

      On Saturday, Warner, Rhys, Ben and I hit the road with a vanload of gear.  After a couple of stops (faffing quotient fulfilled) to pick up Richard and a reverb unit we took off up state highway 2 on a flawless winter's day, destination: someplace rural north-west of Masterton - Keeping It Reel studios.     urlLink    Such a beautiful day! ...   urlLink    Keeping It Reel: 8 track is where it's at   urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       urlLink      urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       urlLink     The recording progresses quickly.  Live takes; then acoustic overdubs, tambourine and shakers, then vocals.  About six hours after we arrive, we have the three tracks down.  Stand by for radio release...

      As luck would have it, not long after having declared my good health to a friend, I got sick.  But by some twist of fate I only had to take one day off work.  Fate?  Yeah - it's a drag to have days off in the middle of the week (particularly to be sick), it throws me out, it's hard to get back into the swing.  Of course it was unavoidable.  I called my boss to explain and he said, "You just get better."  Phew.  So I spent my day at home sleeping and reading  urlLink  the Rules of Attraction   by Bret Easton Ellis.  I really enjoyed it, it's far more complex than the movie but still so stark.  And I got better, enough to go back to work today.    Work was a drag - yesterday I got hooked up on this  urlLink wee thing  and as these things can tend to do it got a bit addictive.  It's calmed down now... yeah nah it has...  I've been experimenting with using  urlLink post summaries  after reading about them  urlLink here .  I wanted to be able to only use them occasionally, such as today when I'm anticipating whacking this huge list in a post (see below) but it seems the little  and...  which links you to the full post will appear at the bottom of every post.  So just to assist with that when I use the summary mode I'll end the first part with an ellipsis, for non word geeks that's a "...".  That way readers will know there's more.  I have a tendency to use them all the time anyway but I'll try not to end a post with them without need.  I got this list of books from  urlLink Supergood  (he got it from  urlLink Bizgirl ); apparently the idea is to bold those you've read; italicise started-but-never-finished; underline those you own but haven't gotten to yet; and add three of your own...

      First: that title was blatantly stolen from  urlLink Onanon's  album; it's in my head because I was up late last night editing for  urlLink Blink .    Second: Finally added a few new links,  urlLink Bizgirl  cos I was flabbergasted to find she'd linked to here (how nice!) and  urlLink Supergood  cos I visit quite often  and  he's linked to here, and  urlLink Crap Shag  cos it's hilarious and I think I have one or two stories to share.  Third: Am considering implementing  urlLink Haloscan  for comments cos the existing regime has its faults.  My question is: what will happen to existing comments?  Will they disappear?  I know someone out there can help me... Noizy?  p.s. I think I'm getting sick... damn

      Speaking of stuck song lyrics, some songs are just so apt.  Bad hair day?   urlLink Nine Inch Nails'   urlLink Piggy :  "Nothing's turning out the way I planned..."  Trent Reznor is quite the master at repressed angst.    Whereas I pride myself more on melodrama.  And not saying what I mean.

      What a weekend.  I was so hungover.   urlLink Hot Swiss Mistress  gig at the Cross on Friday - fantastic - everyone was so happy that we just had to get trashed!  (Or was it just me?)  Vaguely recall stumbling - no, weaving - home via BK and attempting to drink tea and passing out with the light on and waking up at 11am and it was  not  a good scene and didn't become one until some point last night when Marilyn made me a wonderful dinner and let me at her music collection.  Now I'm fully hooked up with every Calexico release imaginable, not to mention Miles Davis, Belle & Sebastian, Sigur Ros, Beck, Cinematic Orchestra, Mr Scruff (if you read this Marilyn, I accidentally stole 'Keep It Unreal'), Amon Tobin... the shit, in other words.  Even the new Prince!  (Haven't listened to it yet).  (In contrast?) I had such a cultured evening on Saturday.  Fell out of bed about 7pm (just a wee nap) and managed to grab a tim-tam* on the way out of the house to meet Guy and Sacha.  We got lost but eventually found the Adam Concert Room at Vic and saw 'Ghost in the Machine', a performance practice music thingy with weird ass shit going down.  It was cool.  Ryan 'Experimental Turntablist' Cockburn was up first and his broken-and-reattached vinyl made for some interesting listening... luckily my hangover was subsiding a little.  (Thanks for the shirt Ryan!)  Then I hightailed across town to see 'King of Stains' at  urlLink Bats,  where Gibby played the most unlikeable character ever, and so well!    *My Weekend of Cake.  All I ate on Saturday was one tim-tam, then Sunday was a steady diet of coffee cake for lunch and chocolate cake for afternoon tea... credits to Jolene's mum and Stacey and Tara... oh and that other cake...  thanks  Tara!

       In days gone by, I read a lot of books.  Nowadays it's all I can do to read half a page before my I lose consciousness.  Lifestyle?  Trade-off.  I get so jealous of my flatmates who charge through a book a week, swapping them, talking about them.  Getting through an entire book while I can still remember how it started is a rarity nowadays; half finished and discarded, with increasingly random bookmarks, they litter the floor beside my bed.    But this time I  did  finish a book.  It's one I found in a $1 bin at my favourite second hand store, Arty Bees on Courtenay Place.  (Bizy Bees is cool too, but Arty Bees is much closer to my house).  What was it?   F. Scott Fitzgerald: "Tender is the Night."    Now ever since I did a 400 level philosophy paper called 'The Fragility of Goodness' (now called  urlLink 'Why Be Moral?')  I've been in the habit of noting passages in novels that I read.  I finished varsity a way back but I still like to do it, even though I hardly ever actually refer back.  But now I have this new public forum where I get to say whatever I want!  It's perfect.  So here goes - just a handful of lines that resonated for me..  For a synopsis of the story, go  urlLink  here  (but it will  spoil  the story a bit)...  From when they first get together: "They were both in the grey gentle world of a mild hangover of fatigue when the nerves relax in bunches like piano strings, and crackle suddenly like wicker chairs." p64  Aww... I'm such a romantic.  Then there's bits I wanted to translate from French.   "'Tu as vu le revolver? Il etait tres petit, vrai perle - un joule.''Mais assez puissant!' said the other porter sagely.  'Tu as vu sa chemise?  Assez de sang pour se croire a la guerre.'" p74    "'You saw the revolver? It was very small, and beaded - a jewel.' 'But rather powerful!' said the other porter sagely.  'You saw his shirt?  Enough blood as if it was a war.'"  "He knew, though, that the price of his intactness was incompleteness.  'The best I can wish you, my child,' so said the Fairy Blackstick in Thackeray's  The Rose and the Ring , 'is a little misfortune.'" p101  "'Wouldn't it be fun if -' it had been; and then 'Won't it be fun when -'  It was not so much fun." p149  "She felt the nameless fear which precedes all emotions, joyous or sorrowful, inevitably as a hum of thunder precedes a storm." p256  "Nicole was glad he had known so many women, so that the word inself meant nothing to him; she would be able to hold him so long as the person in her transcended the universals of her body." p257  Also, I like the way they say "tight" when they mean drunk.

       urlLink    Phone call.  The hold music was from Wuthering Heights.  "Heathcliff, it's me I'm Kathy I've come home... let me in your window," stuck in my head.  When I was 17 I used the window more often than the door.    I wanted to find out how many seconds I've been alive for.  I found a counter somewhere on  urlLink www.christiania.org  but that was last year and I've lost it now.  I think I've counted every one, but I didn't write it down.  Ah.  Not the one I was after but it'll do -  urlLink here : 60680889947 and counting.  Spiderman 1, Spiderman 2.  These late nights do nothing for my 'get smarter' campaign.  ... so are the days of our lives.

      It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.   A Tale of Two Cities,  by Charles Dickens   Considering what didn't kill me on the weekend, I must certainly be a lot stronger. And check out the build of my character!    Things I lost during my weekend in Auckland:      My camera. Stolen from my bag at Eden's. Including an entire film of photos from gigs, and since I can't remember past last week, who knows what else?  A demo CD. Stolen from my bag at Eden's. What may come of this?!  A piece of paper containing email addresses of people who liked Hot Swiss Mistress. If you read this, do email...   My illusions, and quite possibly the respect of my friends. Thanks Ben, you are a great Driver. Can  anyone  remember what actually happened?   I ought really to balance this out with a list of the good things that happened. There are quite a few.    Scored an interview on Flipside (will be on sometime this week). Thanks Damian.  Scored an interview on bFM. Thanks Jason and thanks Mikhal.  Got to play a gig with Chris Knox. Chris Knox is cool, inspiring, an entertainer, and a nice bloke.  Got to play gigs with the Demi-Whores and the Shallows. Auckland is lucky to have you.  Experienced the kindness of Edward Gains. Thanks Ed, you're great.  After losing Rhys' bass guitar, we found it again.  Bought three really cheap slave-laboured tops (same style, different colours) from a shop in Newmarket. Thanks Ru for the tip-off.  Met some cool people. Got re-acquainted with others.  Due to my Extreme Hangover, the boys let me have shotgun from Auckland  all the way to Bulls!!  How kind.   It's hard not to say that Auckland is weird. It's just not Wellington, that's all... Stuff is all miles away, and there's this motorway buzz that tantalises because you just  know  it could be so much quicker to get from A to B if only you knew how to use it. Anyway, thanks heaps to Hayden, Kyle and Damon for putting us up - and to Rowan and Mazzy for putting up with us. Thanks to Kyle for the PA, to Edward Gains for helping with our tech issues, and thanks Damian, Jason, Oliver, Mikhal, Reuben, Andrew and everyone else - forgive my addled brain!  I'm learning that people are strange. And when I try to fit my image of a person onto the reality of that person from an objective perspective there are parts that don't fit and parts that I could never have imagined. That's about all I've got from today. It's been a day of Catatonic Low Productivity. I seem to have spent more time pissing around on  urlLink friendster  (try  urlLink this  for a laugh) and  urlLink KoL  than on work... I will pay for it tomorrow but at least my brain may be in attendance by then.  Are you out there? Do you read this?? How could I know?!

      Apparently they're just standard up here. You know, the climate. In associated news I'm a bit fragile and I'm supposed to be having a nap before the boys pick me up at 4 (assuming they can find me in this far flung suburb) so we can go to TVNZ where the nice people at Flipside are going to interview Hot Swiss Mistress. It's a media-themed day; we have an interview with Jason on  urlLink 95 bfm  around 6 this evening. Then we're off to Pt Chevalier for a gig with Chris Knox and the Demi-Whores. I'm looking forward to hanging at the Ambassador. It's nice and laid back.   Last night's gig was great fun. I was kind of expecting the Kiss and Makeup Club thing to be like Indigo's Rock Cradle, but it was more like Audio Roulette with Knixx... playing all the old hits and lots of people dancing. Hot Swiss made a strong start and had a good set. I had a lovely time and was pleased to meet Heather and Paul. It was also cool to get a taste of the Boxcar Guitars playing at the Misery exhibition opening at Illicit on K'Rd. Missed the Shallows... lucky I'll get to see them tomorrow night. Today has been a little strained: I woke up after spending the night completely cocooned in a blanket to find my eyes all itchy and red - I suspect it was the dog's blanket... but I have managed to fit in a good bit of shopping which is always nice to do while on holiday.  There goes the rain again. Good night.

      I am utterly useless at packing. Not so much at figuring out what to take and putting it in a bag, but just getting the job done. There keeps being distractions... I've got t-shirts covered, at least.  Since I'm off to Auckland tomorrow to do some gigz, I figured I'd do a wee roundup on gigz I've been to lately. [For an explanation of the plural 'z' phenomenon that's gripped me lately see the  urlLink Video Kid  interview in  urlLink A Low Hum 11 .] Last Thursday I saw Gramsci and Tommy at Happy. I got there a little into Gramsci's set but nonetheless was quickly mesmerised by his powerful delivery and lovely melodies. Nice. New album out I think? Tommy played for bloody ages, got the crowds moving though. On reflection that's the only gig I've been to lately. Stayed home Friday, and Saturday I attended my own virtual gig with the help of Singstar at Jane's birthday. We got pretty competitive - I think Jane and I got the top scores, both of us ranking 'Hit Artist' for Blondie's 'Heart of Glass'. So, I lied when I said 'Take On Me' by Aha was the only good track.  Clearly I'm not at MC5 (or Jurassic 5) tonight... yeah I know, rock n roll legacy and all that, but I've got weekend expenditure to think of. I considered attempting to sneak up the back stairs at Indigo but considering I've been hassling Brendan for a ticket it wouldn't be seemly.  However earlier today I did have the privilege of sitting in on the final rehearsal for  urlLink Fly My Pretties , which opens at  urlLink Bats  tomorrow. If you don't have a ticket, sorry, it's sold out. Even the just-added extra late Friday show! Wow. The creativity was palpable, all those accomplished musicians in the same space - there's so many they even have to share instruments. I was rather upset to have missed 'Bag of Money', being my fave Barnaby song, unless of course I had to choose from  urlLink Flash Harry  as well... anyway what I did see was pretty cher, the set looked cool, but most of all it was exhilarating to witness the collaboration of such a crew of Wellington's finest.  Tomorrow morning I get to go to work for just as long as it takes to sort out one file then I get to leave to drive to Auckland with three nice boys!! Cool. I've been looking forward to this for a long time. For gig details see the sidebar.  Stand by for exciting on tour news! Updated hourly!*   *Neither of the two preceding statements are true

      So yeah life is fast right now, it's fast times all round and there's not much time to sit and watch it go by. There will be on Wednesday, since I'll be on my ass most of the day watching the North Island go by as we cruise up state highway one Auckland-bound. No speeding, since the Van has that dratted safety device I mentioned  urlLink here.    I had a guitar lesson last week and learned how to play Lou Reed's 'Perfect Day'. Yesterday, in exchange, Rhys showed me 'Golden Age' by Beck. It's so lovely... just need to remember the words now. I have to admit I prefer the Flaming Lips version, being such a Wayne-freak.  Ooh and I went to 'Frodo is Great... Who is That!!?' on the weekend. It was really well done, lots of laughs and nice to see familiar faces. Well done Hannah, Stan and Nick. Oh and Bret.   This morning I spilled a glass of water onto an electric lamp. My flatmate said I should pull it apart and dry it out but I tend not to agree... probably just ignore it until I forget then turn it on anyway. An electricity-themed morning, really, or lack of it - I was stopped in my tracks by the lack of light in the bathroom. Shower in the dark? Just didn't seem right... Shower with the door open? Hmm... no... I settled for candlelight. Nice.  Last but not least:   HAPPY BIRTHDAY JANE!!   Thanks for the party on Saturday - Playstation Singstar is gonna be all good once they get some decent songs on it. There's only so much A-ha one can deal with... and that was the best track on it.  In exciting work news, I have an Important Research job that has to be done by midday. Gah, the pressure!  PS Finished Steinbeck's 'Cannery Row' a few weeks ago; comments to come one of these days. Have again passed by the unfinished 'the Prince' by Machiavelli and a few others and started Elizabeth Knox's 'The Vintner's Luck' again.
