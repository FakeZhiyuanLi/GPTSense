      They say that if you listen closely you can hear eight million stories in a new york minute, as you lumber around the CITY.I too have a story about the city, it's not about love or violence,hate or friendship,not even about everything or nothing,it's rather a simple example of our asexual carnal incontinences!!!  They call it the biggest party in the world,more than million people attend this once a year party on the new years eve, to see a 1060 pound crystal ball drop from a pole on one times square.I think it's not the ball,or the celebrities who press the button,or music shows,not even the confetti or pyrotechnics that makes it such a wonderful moment.The ball drop is a spectacular event because you celebrate it with thousands of people around you,whom you have never met,or will ever meet again.People surpass their differences to celebrate as one,the passage of time or time itself.Have you ever wondered,what exactly you are celebrating on the new year's eve, I think we are celebrating time,the time that we had,the time that we will have.After all passage of time is how our future attacks our present and it's only apt that the drop happpens at time square.It was my first year in the United States,and Syracuse University not being very far from the city,it was only natural,that me and my friends  decided to celebrate the 2002/03 new year at times square.  Me,PV,DV,Sanjay and Hari drove down to manhattan,parking our car somewhere in New Jersey,we caught the path to manhattan and reached there by the morning of dec 31st.We did a lot of walking around,meeting friends in the city,a bit of shopping and stuff like that.For starters the event is not exactly a walk in the park,security is immense,you see more cops than parking spaces.Traffic will be closed between Broadway and Seventh Ave as far south as 42nd St and as far north as 59th, by 6pm , or earlier, depending on crowds.So you have to come take your spot atleast by noon,thats is to get a good spot I mean.and once you are in the broadway cordon there is no going back,coz you can't come back,and the cops close down the streets by the 5 or 6PM,and guys booze isnt allowed,unless you know the cops or something.We took a spot close to the 44th street,which is not much of a spot anyway,but we were new to the city,and we were thrilled.  We stood there chatting with each other and people around us,calling home and friends and announcing that we were at times square.After two or three hours you get a little tired,and your legs begin to ache.Then it strikes you that you have atleast another six hours of standing still to do,and you desperately try to keep up your spirits,which actually is not very difficult with so many people around.After another hour I began cursing myself for having that large soda,It feels as though you are subjecting your bladder to heavy weight training.I kept myself distracted by chatting,lot of yelling,and by nightfall everyone is hysteric anyway.I waited and waited, and I literally began counting down seconds when there was still couple of hours to go.When finally the one minute count down began,I was ecstatic,not out of joy,but out of hopefulness that I would be able to do justice to my bladder.  After the confetti and pyrotechnics,and customary hugging and dancing and handhsakes,my friends and me started the mad scurry to find a restroom.Now I think most people had the same issue and most of the open shops and restuarants closed down their restrooms,we finally found a run down chinese take-out,which even that night was not crowded.I bought some old lo-mein and spring rolls and won myself a ticket to use the restroom.When I got to the restroom,one of it was occupied and there were a few people waiting outside the other one,as I stood wiggling in the line,a cop came around asked us,who was in the other restroom,no one seemed to know,as he knocked,two teenagers came scurrying out,people in the queue were filled with rage,and I am surprised that the two got out unscathed.The cop was my hero that day,and when I finally releived my bladder,I felt as though I was having the best time of my life.

      Like every other engineering college, GCE was a sombre campus with only  occasional zoom of transport vehicles on the highway 7 that reminded the inhabitants of civilization closeby. I had been a student for a year by now and loved to hate the place, coming from the overcrowded city of Madras,GCE was for me the vapid place filled with unintersting wannabe engineers. I was never gregarious which in addition to my inherent laziness in manner made people think that I was haughty. So when I entered the department of electrical engineering after dallying with a host of unnecessary courses for a year, I was without a friend.Yes, I knew a couple of andamanese guys and their cronies, but they were a divertissement at best. Thats when I met her,Sujatha was everything that I was not, she was always surrounded by people,she was immensely popular among guys,when I was almost infamous,'the haughty outsider.' She was all talk where I was reticent,well to put it in perspective I have to concede that, she was 'cool' and I was 'who does he think he is.'   She was in my batch of seven people who are forced to do some trite electronic experiment, not that it promotes team spirit or anything but due to lack of enough working zener diodes(man who cares?), And one good think about my team(oh yeah!!) was that we had a geek among us,she would do evrything and ask us to copy the readings, so I had enough room, time actually,to make my moves.Well as usual I started bragging about how boring the place is, and she was like "oh yeah", so thats how it began, a love story that started out of hate, how profound?  The story of our first date is an interesting one.After a few weeks of all those 'hate talk' and college gibberish, I suggested that we should hang out more,may be catch a movie or something ,she agreed that we could do it sometime. As soon as the class got over I ran to her and said may be we should do it tommorow, my reasons being weekends are boring and I am not going to my hometown.Out of great reluctance and great deal of 'lets not break his heart attitude' ,she said 'ok.' I was thrilled, but my happiness was short lived coz I came to know later that night that one of her friends had had an accident, and that she was in the hospital overnight, I thought, oops!! there it goes man, she wouldnt come. I didnt have her number or anything so I couldnt call her up too, so I turned up pretty late at our rendevouz point to check just in case if the gods have smiled on my smiten soul, but there she was standing in the sun,a bit flustered,she was wearing a grey cotton salwar which was sassy without being classy,it had an air of 'I didnt make an effort to dress' but she was beautiful nevertheless.After a round of apologies she told me that she had spent the night in the hospital with her friend and it wouldnt be appropriate  for her to be on a date.I offered to accompany her to the hospital, and yes that was my first date,in a hospital caffeteria. Well we went on a lot of dates thereafter we talked about movies, family,love,college,future.....everything but us.BY this time I had a few friends, thanks mainly to her, I was now sociable, and everyone had accorded us the status "in love", except that we hadnt spoken about it.Dates kept happening and suddenly we had exams and we had semester holidays and we went to our homes.Thats when I started to miss her awfully, that when i realised I cudnt do without her, not now,not ever. When we came back to school she was very different, she was very cold, she was normal when we were amongst friends but she tried not being alone with me.I just couldnt stand it, so I asked her to come out with me on sat(feb 12th), I told her that we needed to talk about something evry important.We met at our usual place, I took her to chinese restaurant and we started talking, first it was mostly the usual stuff, then she started telling me about her parents and her family and how strict they were.We talked a lot that day, after sometime we ended up in an ice cream parlour, thats when I asked her may be we should go out on the valentines day, she gave me avery cold stare and said "no." I thought ok! Wrong move.When we were just about to go back to her hostel,she said, "wait may be we should talk." We walked and walked, there was not much talking, then she suddenly looked up at me and said those wonderful words, "Is it possible?",not the usual picayune dialogues like, "do u love me" or "i love you".Thats what I liked about her, she guaged that there was no point in going on if the relationship is not going anywhere,read as marriage.And she knew that it was going to be difficult with all the parental pressures, so she she just put it very succinctly,if it was possible to go the distance,ofcourse hoping that I would get it.Thankfully I was wearing my thinking cap and I said "yes,it is." Only later did she confess that she was not responding to me after the holidays, coz she she was helplessly trying not to fall in love with me.Is it Possible?

      I was sitting in my office, lab, rather,thinking of ingenious ways to set up a protected page on a server that supports nothing more than Jscript.Thats when it hit me,I was hungry, I again began to ponder on the historically indecesive question of,"where, what?" Eat I mean, not that I had too much of a choice near the campus, but coz people think too much about the choices they have.Having resolved to eat only low-carb, high protein diet....since morning,I settled on SUBWAY.   I was ushered in with a wide glee and the widely accepted way of saying, "What the heck do u want?","How may I help you,Sir?" Like always I said,"I will have a chicken teriyaki,please", spat came a response,"why does everyone have Chicken Teriyaki," which set me thinking,why? Is it because of the chicken that tastes like everything or the teriyaki sauce which I have never liked anyway, or is it because of the veggies that u stuff in there, yeah right, who am I kidding.May be its the South West dressing,but thats just me, why do lots of people like it.I concluded that the answer should lie between the chicken and the teriyaki. All this time I did'nt even notice that I had gobbled down the foot of bread. When I got back to my lab, I asked one of the consultants in my lab,"Hey Phil,do you like the chicken teriyaki at the SUBWAY",he smiled,coz he is a kind of a smiler and said, "sure as hell man,who doesnt?" "But Why,why do people like it," the reply sent me back to thinking about password protecting a page in that goddamn server,it was, "Who is John Galt."
