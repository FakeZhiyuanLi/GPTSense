      Danny was back. He has been off ill for the last two days. He said he has been thinking about me, and we talked all through lunchtime sitting on fag bank (a grass verge where all the smokers go because the teachers can't see it from the school). He was smoking when I got there, but he knows I don't like it so he stopped.  It was sunny and so chilled out.   Then after school, he ran down to my bus queue and pulled me round the corner, gave me a quick kiss, then ran off to get his lift home.

      ... Sucked.  Danny was not at school and when I asked Muds about us, he didn't seem to know what Danny thought of me. Do guys really not talk to each other?

      I watched Kill Bill 2 round at Clint’s. I thought it was really good. Uma is a wonderful actress, so pretty.  Danny didn’t make it. It was just Ru, Muds, Clint, Andrew, Jo (Clint’s sister) and I.   I don’t know why Danny wasn’t there. Does that mean he regrets yesterday?

      Yesterday was fantastic. We hung out in Camden all day in the sun. The lads did a bit of boarding, but mostly we just hung out. Muds persuaded this guy, with amazing purple hair, to buy booze for us.   Muds and Danny had plenty of money and we got bottles all different alco-pops, mostly Bacardi breezers. Clint came and Ru got off with him. Then Danny and I went for a walk and we go off with each other. It was really cool; he is an excellent kisser.  I hope he’ll ask me to be his girlfriend now. We didn’t talk about it, but we’re always hanging out and he doesn’t seem to be interested in any other girls at the moment. He used to see this girl called Jenny, but they have been over for a while.  I was thinking this morning about what I would do if we did get serious. My Doctor told me that I could have sex if both of us are really careful, but that would mean telling Danny about the HIV. I could not risk it otherwise. He is really cool, but I am scared that he won’t want me if I tell him. I guess I don’t have to worry about this for a while.    We’re all going round to Clint’s house this afternoon. He has Kill Bill II on pirate DVD.

      I went to the hospital after school. What a waste of time. I had to wait for an hour, and then all they did was take a blood test and send me home. I don’t see the point of these new tests.

      Yesterday Ru and I almost fell out. We almost never argue. Mum and I always used to argue. Once we got into this really stupid argument about school, and we started saying really mean things to each other. Then I said that I hated her for giving me this disease. I thought she would say something nasty back, but she just went quiet. I said sorry later, and she said it was ok, but it wasn’t. We never argued after that. She just said what she thought and then said I should make up my own mind. I wish I had never said it.

      I just watched Battle Royale. My mate taped it for me last night. It is my new favourite film. I wish they would send my class to the island and send Danny and Muds too. I reckon Danny, Muds, Ru and I would win.

      We were supposed to do cross-country today, so I said I was not feeling well and they let me time the other girls instead. I saw Danny at lunch, and he asked if, on Saturday, I wanted to go with him and the other boys to the skate park in Camden. Should be a laugh. I hope Muds is there. He is really funny (but not as sexy as Danny).  Ru seemed upset with me, because she had to do cross-country and I didn’t. The games teachers always let me off, but sometimes make her do it even when she says she is ill or on her period. I think they must know about my HIV cause they never argue when I want to get out of it. My mother told the head master, when I started the first year, in case I cut myself or got sick. I hope all the teachers don’t know. It shouldn’t matter that I have HIV; I don’t have AIDS, so there is no reason I should get off and Ru not.   Ru was ok by the end of the day and she’s coming to the skate park too. She can actually board a bit, but we’ll probably just watch. She fancies one of the lads called Clint. He was off school sick today, but hopefully he will be ok by Saturday.

      Hi, My name is Lucy. I thought it would be fun to write a blog. One of the guys in the year above has one. His is really cool, about all the things he does with his skateboarding mates. Mine won’t be as cool as I can’t board to save my life. He tried to show me once, but I fell off and hurt my arm. I don’t think I’ll try that again.  I guess I should tell you something about me. Well, I am 14 and I live with my Grandma in London. My best mate is called Ru. We don't get on with most of the girls in our year cause they are all really full of themselves. We usually hang out with a group of boys from the year above and some girls from another school. They are goths. We’re not, but we sometimes dress up a bit, when we go out them.  Ru is really cool. We’ve known each other for years. She’s the only one that knows about my HIV. I don’t want to tell anyone else in case they treat me differently or think I am a slag. I didn’t catch it sleeping around. In fact, I am a virgin (they do still exist). My mother caught it before I was born, but she didn’t know. I caught it from her when I was born. My younger brother didn’t catch it. I don’t know why, just one of those things.  My brother doesn’t live with us. When my mother died we both went into care for a bit. Then Grandma came back to the UK and now I live with her. He has autism and they said he would be too much for Grandma to cope with, so he lives with another family now. He comes and stays sometimes, but I haven’t seen him for ages. I miss him.  Anyway, I better go now. I have homework to do. Well actually the Simpson’s just started, so I am going to watch that, but then I have homework to do. I wonder if anyone will ever read this.
