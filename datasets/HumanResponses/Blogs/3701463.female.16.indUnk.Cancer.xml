      9 more days til I'm finally 16! Yea! Not... I'm not having a party or anything. Of course that is my choice, but who would I invite? There is Jayla, Duane, Phillip, Robert, and Ricardo, but that's about it, and Duane has to work so he couldn't come.... OH well. I'm getting sick of my life. I finally got rid of my dad and I guess I expected my mom to be nice ot me.  She bitches all the time because she says I don't do enough around the house... Well, I think I do a lot considering that I am her daughter and I have nearly raised my brother... It's nice to feel appreciated.And now she won't even let me tay home on the weekends becasue she doesn't trust me. Don't get me wrong I love Gramma and Grampa to death, but I hate being over there every weekend and then being there every day during the week to go swimming... I've been thinking a lot since Kent State Competition about Model U.N. That was my second comp. and I pushed my self really hard for it. I worked so hard researching and everything and then BOOM! It's over and Val and I had NADA! I blame her.... She always contrdicted me in everything we said, She went so far off policy it wasn't even funny, and yet everyone is blaming me.. I think I want to quit. I love debating and I actually do think some of our topics are pretty cool, and I wish I could be a good delegate, but I don't think I can ever do that now. I knew me and Sanchez didn't have a chance walking in to Jefferson. There was no doubt of that one in my mind, And when he meowed in council it only solidified my fears... I'm getting that awful feeling that I came into the downfall of what had once been such a great organization... Mr. White did say it was a "rebuilding year" but i feel like I let everyone down... I think if me and Val could have pulled a Superior jor even an excellent we would have won Kent... OH well. And then there is this whole "duane thing" I love him soo much and I don't want him to leave this fall... I wish I could keep him here with me, becasue I know that I am going to need him more than ever this coming year. I wanna try out for Volleyball and I'm hoping I'll make the team... Even if it's not varsity I just want something to do, If not then I'm going to play soccer. I don't care... I don't know about M.U.N. though, Iwant to quit but I have all these people saying give it another chance... So I think I will give it one more year... If I lose all of those competitions then I will quit and tell myself I tried. Band is getting boring. I use to love playing the flute. Everyone use to tell me I was excellent, but I quit playing during concert badn so I could sit next to Duane and play trumpet... Ahhh, how stupid of me. I'll probably play trumpet during marching band and flute during concerts again... And Key Club, well, that isn't really that big of a deal... Well, I have to go, The mommy monster is screaming....

      I feel sooo lazy.... I want to lay around the house, but NO!!! my mom get to go back to sleep and I have to clean... It is sooo unfair. But anyways, Mom saw my wrists she threatend that if she saw anymore "Artwork" on them, she would take me to the Nord Center... HOW SILLY!!! WHY DOES NOBODY UNDERSTAND ME????? The only time I can get Duane to listen or care is when he thinks he's getting laid. Not that I mind all the sex but I mean sometimes I feel like thats the only way I can talk to him.... maybe I;m just stupid and am being used but I don't care becasue I'M NOTHING COMPARED TO HIM. HE IS SOOO AMAZING...

      Well, the only major thing that happened todya was GROUP. Basically, every Wednesday from 1 to 2:30 I have to sit through a SUPPORT GROUUP for SEXUALLY ABUSED teenage girls. It's a load of B.S. I mean I like the girls and we all get a long but the purpose I thought was to help us move on and lead better lives and all  but the group leades just want to dwell on every thing... I  don't want to keep going over what happened I just want to start living my life normally again....Maybe I just was in too much pain from soccer to care much...

      Well, today went ok considering everything I did. First the appointment with Dr. Kovach, as I already mentioned, I'm not very receptive to the idea of some chick that I DON'T KNOW!!!!!! staring between my legs. But honestly, there's nothing wrong with my thoughts on this. Well, we got to the Doctor's and had to wait 2 HOURS!!!! I just wanted to hurry up and get this shit over with.... she "examined" me and said that I am the "picture of health" Scary, huh? Well, at least out of all this I got my perscription for Ortho-Tricyclin Lo. It's a birth-control pill. Duane will be happy because it is supposed to "LEVEL OUT" my MOOD SWINGS. I  don't think I have bad mood swings but Mom and Duane think I do. Mom said that if this doesn't work then I earned myself a "happy pill." Later, on I went to Southview with Duane to play soccer. I had SOOO much fun.I'm giong to try out for the school team. Wish me luck! We went to my house afterwards, and Grampa was there WITH MARILYN!!!!! My mom (and I) hate her!!!! I could not believe he had the balls to bring hre to home!!! Well, my body hurts sooo bad..... so i'm going to bed....

      Sorry, I haven't been able to post in a while... lack of time management you could say... Today is Bubbi's first day of Safety Town (How Cute???) He LOVES it! Frisay is when he graduates. After he got home from Safety Town I made us lunch and we played outside in the sprinkler... Duane came over after work just like always.. When he got here he told me that Soccer Practice is Tuesday and Thrusday at 7:00 P.M. WooHoo. I can't wait. But after all of my excitement passed I realized that I have NO Soccer Gear, so Duane took me out and bought me a whole bunch of stuff. I got a pink Adidas soccer bag, a pink, red, and white soccer ball, pink shorts, blue and red reversible shorts, 2 pairs of soccer socks (the kind that are extra big so your shin uards fit under them) blue SHINY shin guards, and a pair of Adidas cleats. I felt sooo bad though because he spent over a hundred dollars on me. Well, after we got home we ate and stuff and  Corey Meadows, Chris Crago, and Jade Stevens all showed up.It's been a while but we all talked. It was fun. I'm kind of glad that Corey broke up with me (or rather Chris broke up with me for Corey) becaasue if he haadn't I wouldn't be with Duane, Well, Chris, Corey, Duane, and me are all going to soccer tomorrow. I can't wait. Unfortunately, I have my first "Woman's Doctor" appointment.... Mom is forcing me to go... Yeah!! NOT!!!! I don't really like the idea of some random chick that I don't know staring between my legs. But then after that I get to play soccer so... I guess I could sit through it...

      No one ever told me that if you drink with some friends and have a kick ass time that it would make the next couple days after that be the most wonderful days of yor life. I can't wait to drink again.... Sean and Ricky, get ready for a year of drinking, smoking, and hilarious times. Duane, I promise I will behave myself and I will only smoke and drink when Sean is there to keep an eye on me. Amazing times.... Ah well, I think next time I get drunk I will post something just to see what I wrote.... lol. It was Ricaro's idea. He is smart.....  Til next time,    Jessie

      Last night was the greatest, craziest night I have ever had. When you mix some crazy people and some alcohol, It is bound to be fun. And it was. We had all the necessities; 1.75 Liters of "Southern Comfort", Black and Milds, Cigars, Swisher Sweets, Marlboro Reds, and of course 4 hilarious people all crammed in my little bedroom.  Duane is the coolest guy I know, hands down. I think he is awesome and he is even more amazing as you get more alcohol into his system. He never got drunk last night, in fact he was the soberest out of all of us. But I must say that the more alcohol he had the better the sex got. But I'll get to that in a minute!  Ricardo is my best friend. He is hilarious. I didn't think he would actually drink as much as he did..... Sean drank less than him but in a shorter amount of time. Whereas, Ricardo had about 15 shots over the course of about 6 hours. He was kind enough though to give me and Duane our space though.  As I said earlier the more alcohol we consumed the better the sex got. Ricardo said that if we wanted he could leave and play on the internet while we did "whatever" so we gladly took him up on the offer, twice. Ricardo later confided in me that hile we were in there and he was sitting here drunk off his ass he kept thinking "Damn, she's quiet!" lmfao. I will never forget how Duane after the second time we had sex said "Wow, I need something to smok after that." I will never forget how calm and peaceful he looked while we sat around smoking. He took a long drag on his cigar and said "The sex was amazing. The sex was fucking amazing!" and Ricardo responding "Yeah, I heard that..." lmao. That is what friends are for.  Sean turned out to be pretty cool. I didn't really know him, but it turned out alright in the end. I would definetly drink with him again. He is hilarious when intoxicated. His most memorable moment was when he drank a shot, looked at the glass started to do nother but changed his mind at the last minute and drank propel instead, which he immediately chased with 4 more shots. It was his idea to order pizza... So we ordered from Marco's and an hour he was like "Dude, it's been an hour... you should call." All turned out well though. We paid the pizza guy and gave him an 80 cent tip which he seemed really pissed about. Oh well, fuck him. Sean unfortunately had to leave early, I felt bad that he couldn't stay longer but oh well.  The whole night was amazing and I can't wait to do it again. Only next time we need more alcohol, more women (for Ricardo), some weed and we should be set. As Ricardo, Duane, and I sat down to drink our last shot each, Duane proposed a toast which I think summd the night up perfectly. "Here's to the end of our summer, great friendships, and wonderful events like this. Oh yeah, and more women for Ricardo! Cheers"  The End
