						   Well, nothing is official yet, but it looks as though Jeremy and I may be grandparents... at 26! "How might this be possible?" you ask. Well, when it's poker night at the house and you put a horny little boy named Alpine in a pin with a sweet little girl named Lily who happens to be in heat, well, stuff happens. We honestly thought it was too soon, but apparently, we were wrong. Alpine had had the motions right for a while now, but his timing was off and the equipment wasn't working when it should... until last night.  So there we are playing Texas Hold'em, and I had just won a nice little hand with pocket queens and another queen on the flop. I bet high and we didn't even see the river because I scared everyone off, but not before I had gotten a few red pieces before the flop. Anyway, so here I am counting out my earnings (cause poker is hard work, damn it), and the guys head out for a smoke break. Jeremy comes back to the door and said, "Kristin, come here right now. NOW!" So I walk outside and there are Lily and Alpine... stuck together butt to butt. Now, after seeing this, I'm am firmly convinced that God has a sense of humor.  I mean really people. What is the purpose of that? Human don't stick together after sex. Lord knows we'd probably think about it a little harder next time we're out at a bar and thinking about taking home some random person because hey, after 6 beers, everyone starts to look pretty good. But what if after you'd had your fun and were ready to go your seperate ways, you couldn't... under no circumstances because you were stuck together for a good 30 minutes. Now for married couples, this would be fine. They could cuddle or lay there together and talk about it, or if they're like a lot of married couples I know, they'd probably just cuddle up close and fall asleep.  But single people would have a harder time. You're with a total stranger, and you do whatever you need to do and then you have to lay there with someone you might have no intention on seeing again and talk for 30 minutes. You know, I think there'd be a lot less casual sex in the world if this were the case. I can think of a lot of people I've dated who I wouldn't want to be stuck to for 30 minutes... stuck to while naked. Pleasant thought isn't it? (That was sarcasm for those of you would didn't pick that up in my written words.)  I must give credit to my dogs though. They handled it very well. These are dogs who freakout when seeing their reflection or when I rip tin foil or when we empty the trash or when about 100 other things happen. But then the dogs get stuck together butt to butt and they are just as calm as can be. They were dragging each other around a bit, but for the most part they just stood there and looked around. The other two dogs, Annie and Mattie, were confused as hell. All of a sudden their two siblings had morphed into one long multi-colored dog with two heads. Wasn't there a two headed dog in mythology? I think there was, but I can't recall it at the moment.  Anyway, I'm over the shock of it all now... mostly. If I didn't say so already, we wanted them to have puppies, just not yet. However, I'm sure these will be the cutest, smartest dogs ever! Lily and Alpine are both smart, beautiful, sweet, loving and pure dog! What could be better? And as I told my husband regarding this unexpected pregnancy, "Better her than me."  I'll keep you posted on the pups.  Oceans...  Gissy

						   Ok, so I started a new diet/exercise program... Again. But I've done this one before, and I believe it really can work. Let's put it this way, it better work. I'm not terribly overweight, but I am somewhat big. My clothes are too tight, but I refuse to buy new ones. I ache in my knees... Is that because they're carrying too much weight? Probably.  So I learned what didn't work for me. Curbing my eating. I love to cook and I love to eat. Diets where I have to cut back to nil don't work for me. I've come to terms with that. Exercising isn't fun, but hey, it's easier than not eating.  So it's day 3 for me on the Body for Life program. I'm still trying to get my eating habits in order. I'm supposed to be eating 6 times a day which seems like a crazy lot, but I've done it before. I can do it again.   I'm taking a whole new approach to the program this time. Last time I did it with a boyfriend and well, it was cool to go to the gym to scope out other guys. I guess I should have known that relationship was going nowhere. But this time, I'm doing it on my own because I want to be the one scoped out at the gym. I want them to want me, knowing they can't have me. Still a long way to go on that, but at least it's a goal. This time I'm taking the program one day at a time. I don't need to try to plan my workouts for the next 6 weeks. I just need to plan mine for today and maybe do a little pre-planning for tomorrow, but that's it. All of a sudden everything seems less of an ordeal.  I almost had a headache yesterday and didn't work out, but you know what? It wasn't a headache at all, it was doubt. Self-doubt, self-pity... It was denial that I'll ever be in any kind of shape but chunky. It was laziness. So I kicked it's butt and said, "Move over! I have plans at the gym." And I went, and I worked out and know what? I didn't ever get that headache, and I felt great afterwards. I was sore and tired as hell, but I felt alive and great and full of energy!  I guess it helps too that I'm doing this as part of their competitions on their website and there's money involved. Actually, now that I think about it, that's probably not much incentive considering my plan to win the lottery (but that's another post altogether). I tried another program where you could win a chance to be on TV! I lasted 2 days. Woohoo.  So it's about 30 minutes until I can leave work and head to the gym and I'm so antsy. I'm ready to go go go!!! Maybe I should go at 4:20 and get my little workout high...  Anyway, wish me luck. I've never finished a workout/diet program in my life, but this time will be different. I have some secret goals that I'm inching toward that I'll have to share at another time.   Oceans....  Gissy
