        Music is an amazing thing. I love all types and I try to listen to it all the time. I find that when I am at work I tend to get more done if I have the radio on in the background. It's funny how music can affect your mood. I can't speak for anyone else, but I find that my mood can sometimes change with the music. I attribute this to possible old memories resurfacing whether they may be good or bad. I find even when I am listening to the radio and a dance song happens to come on and I feel like dancing and I really start to perk up. Whereas a slow song can make me more relaxed and mellow. Sometimes I feel like I am going from one extreme to the other..LOL I must say that I do love to go dancing cause when I am dancing I get really into it. I am not stiff in the least. The music seems to just intoxicate my body and makes me wanna move and never stop. It's almost like someone is taking over me, but I really must say I enjoy it so much. I love dancing and if I could have a career in it I would. It may look easy, but I can attest that it's not. I took a hip hop class earlier this year and man it was quite the workout. I am thinking about taking another one as there is a class starting in Sept. I really did enjoy it and it certainly makes you sweat. Plus it just makes you better at what you love to do. I probably will end up taking it again. Music is a very powerful thing. I listen to it on my way to work, at work, on my way home from work and anytime that I have access to music it's playing. I really should have been in the music biz. Oh well maybe in my next life... This Kool Chick is out.......

       I started my new job this week and I have to say I love it. I work for the government which is REALLY great. I feel like I earned it with all the crap I had to put up with at my old workplace. I get to go to a job everyday that when I leave it stays there. There is no more stress. Life is grand. I am sure at some point I will become stressed, but right now I am enjoying the easy life. Don't get me wrong I have been working my butt off. I have the soar feet to prove it. :) I just felt like saying how great my worklife is. I put up with a lot to get to where I am and I am going to enjoy it.

       I need a place that I can vent right now. I am so upset it's unreal. I feel like I have just had my heart ripped out and shredded into tiny pieces. I found out today that my ex is getting married. He has only been with the girl for about a year and four months. I was with him 3 and a half years and I couldn't even get a proposal. Well I guess when someone gets pregnant only after knowing them for 1 week and you move them into the house within a month when you were suppose to have with your long term girlfriend. I had only been broken up with him for 2 weeks and he had slept with her and got her pregnant. No he did not cheat on me he just got drunk and horny. Your self -esteem really takes a kicking. I guess it's my fault for finding out because my curiosity got the better of me. If I hadn't looked up in the Bay registry I would have never known. I think in some weird twisted way it's better that I did find out because now I can be absolutely sure there is no going back. There was always a question in my mind. It hurts more than I can say. I have to keep wondering if I will ever find someone to spend the rest of my life with. I have heard all the sayings that there is a better one out there for you and it's wasn't meant to be. I am not saying that it's wrong, but at this point it's too hard to take. I just had a bond with him that I know for a fact that I will never find again. It's the one that I always wanted. He even admitted to me awhile back that there will never be someone that shared the bond with him that I did. Yes I may meet someone new and develop one with them, but it won't be the same. It will be certainly different, but definitely not the same. I am just sick of the hurting and the waiting to find the right one. For me I think it will be forever and if that's the case then I will die alone. I will never get to experience the wonderful things about marriage. I know I may be sounding negative, but give me a break my heart was just shattered for a second time.

       Time can either be your friend or your enemy. If you ask me I feel that I am always running out of time to do things as I am sure everyone feels that way. Time is your friend when everything is going well, but it always seems to go by too fast right? Time is your enemy when you are either waiting for something or you are going through something and it just feels like it goes on forever. You just wish it would end, but it never seems to. Then there is If I could turn back time as Cher's song says. I am sure there is at least one time in everyone's life they would want to go back to whether it's good or bad. We all have something we want to relive or change a mistake we made. The thing is if we were able to do that then maybe we would never have had the opportunity of meeting some of the great people in our lives. Reason being is they would be somewhere else in their life. As you know you can't be 2 places at once. :) I know there are quite a few things I would like to redo over, but as we all know it's not possible, so you accept and move on. It's these experiences that make us a smarter and stronger person. I just wish that when things are going so well and your happy that time wouldn't go by so fast. It seems like you don't get enough time to enjoy whatever it is at that time making you feel so happy. I will say that time does go by too fast in general. I hate when I realize that I am not as young as I use to be. Then I am somewhat scared of the future cause you never know when it's your "time" to go. Everyday you are one step closer. All I have to say is live in the moment and cherish every minute because you don't know when your last will be. It could be today , tomorrow or the next day. Just be happy with what you have accomplished. Show and tell your family &amp; friends how much you appreciate them being a part of your life.

        I was reading someone's horrible tragic true experience on a website and it made me realize that no matter who we are we are never going to get away from adversities in our lifetime. I guess they are put there to make us a stronger person. What I don't understand is why is it some people have more horrifying experiences than others. What is it that defines them from the other people in the world? Is it because they are more weak, so they are given a greater obstacle to overcome? Then there are some people that are pretty lucky in the sense that they get everything they want. You might think they are happy, but there is something that can always be a little better. I personally hate doing these tests or whatever you wanna call them. I mean really what is the point? Why should people suffer so much? I know that my experiences to some people could seem like nothing and to some other ones a huge deal. I guess as they say it's just a roll of the dice. All I know is that for the next while I would like some luck when rolling those dice cause I am sick of losing in this big game. Please comment and let me know your thoughts. :)

       Honestly I don't get why people just can't be honest and tell the truth. If someone asks you a question then give an honest answer. I will say this is one of my biggest pet peeves. I just don't understand what the point of it is. They will either get a clue or figure it out in the end and be more hurt, so why wouldn't you just save them the trouble later and do it sooner? If anyone actually does end up reading this then I ask of you if someone asks you a question then please give them an honest answer. There is too much lying going on.

        Do you work out? Well if you don't then you are truly missing out. Yesterday I had the best work out I have ever had. I had so much adrenaline pumping through me it was amazing. I just didn't want to stop and why would I? I was working towards my goal and feeling good about it. I can't even put into words how I felt. I wish I could because then maybe I could inspire you to take this challenge. Really that's what it is. It's not easy to work out. The reason being is you are always having to push your limits, so you can obtain that goal level to move on to the next. I felt so alive yesterday and I felt better than I ever have in a long time. I will be going again today and it should be a lot of fun. I am sore, but as they say.... no pain no gain! :)
