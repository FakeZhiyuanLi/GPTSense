          I'm so sad right now.  It's sad that I feel the way I do.  I shouldn't be this upset over a person.  Letting this feeling ruin my mood and my evening.  But it's happening.  I don't know if this is real or my mind and my heart are distorting my actual feelings to make it seem like I should be feeling this bad or that I actual love him this much.  I just wish he would just take me back so we can be happy.  I know I can make him happy.  If only he knew.  I feel like such a loser, it doesn't even make sense.  Someone should get a gun and put me out of my misery because I am making a fucking mockery out of my self not to mention embarrassing my self.  God.  Love Sucks!  It just grabs a hold of you and jerks you all around and then throws you on the ground and leaves you there all bruised and bloody.  Not to mention hurting and confused.  But its so wonderful while it lasts right!?  Sure whatever. Yakima

            I am so in love.  It is ridiculous.  I'm sure that he loves me too, but I don't know if he loves me with the intensity that I love him.  Shit I'm thinking of him throughout the day.  Talking about him constantly.  It seems to come from out of no where.  Natay this, Natay that.  I know people get tired of it.  I do too.  It only makes my fall harder and stay deeper in the feelings I cannot seem to control.  I just want to be with him forever.  It sucks, because when it doesn't happen I am going to be sooooo hurt.  Man, I can almost feel it just thinking about it.  Why can't I just have him.  I don't know if I can't, but I don't know if I can either.  This not knowing sure sucks.  I don't like it.  What did he do to make me fall for him so.  He is just wonderful.  He's beautiful.  He has a beautiful person.  He's so true and so honest.  How many guys out there are this good.  There probably are  a lot, but how much rubbish do you have to crawl through to find them.  Too much.  I just want to keep him.  It makes me feel so dreamy and so longing and the same time thinking about it.  I think I'd be so happy if I could be with him forever.  We have so much fun together.  Laughing, talking playing, smiling.  We just genuinely have a great time in each other's company.  Love, it is something funny isn't it.  The emotions it takes you through.  But it can feel so good.  Just being in love.  Man I want to see him right now.  I can wait until I see him this weekend.  I'm like a kid getting ready to go to Disney land for the first time.  May the lord bless me with sweet dreams tonight.

        God I miss my ex so much.  We broke up about a month ago.  He broke up with me.  He says he has a lot on his mind and he doesn't know what direction his life is taking and he doesn't want to hold me back.  Hold me back from what?  From who?  He's who I want to be with.  Does he really mean he doesn't want to hold himself back?  He says that he's not even sure he wants to settle down for good.  He doesn't know if I'm the last girl he wants to date.  Oh.  Okay.  Now I'm sitting here missing him.  The wierd thing is at first it didn't even seem like we had broken up because we still did all the same things.  But now that I've moved out, we're not together all the time anymore.  So now the reality of it is setting in.  We're not together.  I love him so much.  All I can do is shake my head, sigh and hope for the best.
