       urlLink    Look at these two handsome devils. No really thumbs up to Edgar and I for turning 23 eight days apart. (July 17th the Matthew and Eddy on July 24th) Who would have thought hat we would make to 23. (Which coincidently is the number that belonged to the greatest New York Yankee to ever grace this Earth, Don Mattingly) (Side note pay close attention to Donnies last name, Im in it)     &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    If you want to do your ears a favor go out right now and either buy this CD or steal it off the internet. The album is called Good News For People Who Love Bad News by Modest Mouse. Simply brilliant!  &nbsp; urlLink

      As we all know our dear friend Roger has recently become a Somerset County Sheriff. This has ULTIMITLY lead to his discovery of the doughnut. In Rogers mind the doughnut is the perfect food, fast, easy, delicious, and extremely portable. The doughnut can go wherever Roger goes, essentially making it the most prized food in his eating arsenal, next to White Castle of course.(See below picture for further reassurance of this White Castle phenomenon)If his unhealthy love affair with donuts continues we will soon be able to roll him down the street. Congrats Roger, your now officially a cop!

      Colossal props to big G.W. on this day, for showing those bloody red coats (say this part in your head with a British accent) just how badass we Americans can be.

       urlLink    So every one knows that Soccer is the number one sport in the world. (If you dont then you do now) Soccer is so popular that fans go ballistic, creating riots, destroying stadiums; even announcers are known for going insane at a game screaming goal for twenty town minutes straight after one is made. Now are dear friend Edgar here decided to pick on the innocent little children behind us at the Manchester United game last week causing them to become little blood sucking cannibals that came after us and almost gutted us in the parking lot. If you look close at the kid in red who is screaming at Eddy his eyes have turn completely red, which means he is ready to attack.          &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    There is nothing like making your friends do something so stupid during a game of vicious kings (like Adrienne here crewing ten pieces of gum at once, and Edgar drinking a bottle of the finest Arbor Mist money can buy for thirty seconds) when they are all hoped up on the booze, and having a camera handy to capture it and display it for all who subscribe to internet.             &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Ahhh, camp Dodge Ball. Nothing feeds the ego more then taking down fifteen, thirteen years old kids in a brutal game of Camp Dodge Ball with you best friends/co-workers. Yes if you were wondering I have the greatest job in the world especially when you get to spend it with your buddies all day. (Side note, I would be in this picture except a little basted who I will now refer to as the Jet nailed me while I was suffering from a serious ADD attack and was not paying attention)   &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    A few fun facts about Bourbon. If a liquor is to be called Bourbon it has to be made in Kentucky, be at least 50% corn, and guaranteed to give you the dry heaves upon waking after a long night of belligerence.  Thanks Kentucky! Im sure the devil lives there.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Nigeria, what a fantastic little realm. Interesting side note about this extraordinary little country, it has no laws. Yes thats right no laws. This basically translates into people doing what ever they want. So if you feel like getting all loaded up on booze, steeling a Suzuki Samurai, and declaring yourself mayor, go for it because you can. Youve got to love Nigeria. (In case any of you were wondering where Nigeria was, I have provided a detailed map which should suffice your curiosity)   &nbsp; urlLink
