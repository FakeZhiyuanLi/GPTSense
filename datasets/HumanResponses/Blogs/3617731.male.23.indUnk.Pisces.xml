            That's right, Joey Harrington. I'm talking to you, you piece of garbage.  I don't know why people like you, but I can't stand you. You look stupid when you grin. You look stupid everytime I hear you say, "I just know I can succeed in the NFL! I just know it!" And you look especially stupid when you try to play football.  Remember how you played in all 16 games last year and passed for only 2,880 yards? That was crappy. And remember how you threw just 17 touchdown passes but 22 interceptions? That was also crappy. And hey, remember that game against Minnesota where you threw four interceptions? Your quarterback rating that week was only 30.3 Were you even trying?  I know you had a good preseason opener last night. Weren't you 5-of-7? I hope you had fun, because that's probably the most passes you'll complete in a game this season. You're dog meat, Joey Harrington. If you were a birthday present, I would send you back.

       Republicans are getting stranger by the day.  A group calling itself "People of Color United" has started running anti-John Kerry spots on radio stations with largely black audiences. The ads slam Kerry as "rich, white, and wishy-washy," presumably to draw a contrast between George W. Bush's famous appreciation for ethnic diversity.  Anyway, here's the kicker.  The group is funded by an insurance salesman from Indianapolis named J. Patrick Rooney  -- a white guy. Rooney, who slams Kerry for being rich, has a pretty nice savings account himself. Using money from his personal savings and his insurance firm, Rooney has donated more than half a million dollars to Republicans over the past four years.  Keep trying, guys.

            Warning: boring numbers ahead.  The nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office  released a report Friday evaluating the changes of tax laws upon real-world incomes. John Kerry said the report shows that the middle class now shoulders the largest tax burden in this country, while George W. Bush said the report shows everybody got a tax cut.  What Bush didn't say is that the richest Americans got a much larger tax cut. Not just in terms of actual dollars, though, but also in percentage. The top 1 percent of Americans paid 6.8 percent less in taxes than they would have in 2000. Yet someone making about $15,000 only had their taxes lowered by 1.5 percent. What good is that?  John Kerry's tax plan, as you may know, is to erase the tax cuts for Americans making $200,000 or more. According to this report, that would apply to about 22 million households. By rolling back those tax cuts, Kerry would immediately inject nearly $180 billion back into the budget.

            The tagline for this movie was "Whoever wins...we lose." It should've been something like "Whoever wins...moviegoers lose." This was the dumbest movie I've ever seen. I don't care how much you like the "Alien" or "Predator" franchises. Do not go see this movie.  AVP is the most magnificently stupid movie I've ever seen. Ever seen a "Predator" movie? Then let's go ahead and make ourselves a checklist so we can make sure the necessary elements are included in this plot.   Predators come to Earth? Check.  A human earns Predator's respect? Check.  Predator takes off his mask for human in a show of respect? Check.  Lots of Predators show up at the end? Check.  Edge-of-your-seat suspense? Uh...who forgot the suspense? Aw, heck. Let's just make these Predators really clumsy to make up for that.

       Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife attacked John Kerry on Thursday for suggesting that America should wage a "more sensitive" war on terror.  "America has been in too many wars for any of our wishes, but not a one of them was won by being sensitive," Cheney told a group of veterans.  Cheney's wife, Lynne, echoed her husband's sentiments: "This is the kind of left-wing foolishness that certainly isn't appropriate for someone who would seek to be commander-in-chief."  The fact is, though, that we must fight a more sensitive war on terror. Waging traditional campaigns will help us complete a few operations, but unless we are more sensitive to the unique situations, cultures, etc., we will not win the war on terror.   Look at Iraq. I'm no military historian, but from reading Bob Woodward's "Plan of Attack," I would guess that more planning went into the invasion of Iraq than any other military campaign in American history. So what? Our troops are dying every day. Very little progress has been made toward withdrawing our troops. And we certainly haven't quelled terrorism in the region -- the conflict in Najaf is evidence of that. That's due, in large part, to the fact that we terribly misjudged the manner in which we'd be received. Dick Cheney told government officials that the Iraqis would greet our troops with flowers and candy. Wrong.  We must accept the fact that traditional military operations in the Middle East will not quell the hatred of America that leads to terrorism. To believe otherwise is the kind of right-wing foolishness that certainly isn't appropriate for someone who would seek to be commander-in-chief.

            After his abysmal opening round of 75 on Thursday at the PGA Championship, Tiger Woods is tied for 104th and already out of contention at yet another major. At 28 years old, Woods should be in the prime of his career, but he hasn't won a major since the 2002 U.S. Open. That's a drought of 10 majors, assuming he doesn't come back to win the PGA.  Is Woods at risk of becoming the Ken Griffey Jr. of his sport? Sure, Griffey's decline is due in large part to his annual season-ending injuries -- he hasn't played 160 games in a season since 1999, and he hasn't hit 40 home runs since 2000. But Griffey once held the promise of being the greatest player in baseball history, much as Woods once seemed to be destined to break every record in golf.  Both have time to reverse their fortunes, but I'm not sure either will.

            Throughout the mid 1980s, Stallone made a string of terrible movies that will forever live in infamy. Come to think of it, the same could be said of the late 1980s, the 1990s, etc. But I digress. One such movie is the police drama "Cobra," which usually comes on TBS around 2 a.m. on Wednesdays. Sly plays a maverick cop out to stop a serial killer, yadda yadda.  My favorite part of the movie is when Sly shows up at a supermarket to deal with (kill) a guy who's gone crazy and taken hostages. The crazy guy tells Sly, "Get back! I got a bomb here! I'll blow this whole place up!" Sly calmly replies, "Go ahead. I don't shop here."

       Today is the 10-year anniversary of the 1994 baseball strike, the longest work stoppage in pro sports history. In my weekly column in  The Meridian Star  (doesn't that sound pompous?),  I reflect on a much younger Will Bardwell's impressions of the strike .

            Roy Moore, former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court,  spoke to a crowd of several hundred at the Evangel Temple in Meridian on Wednesday night .  As you may recall, Moore was responsible for a two-ton monument of the Ten Commandments that was erected in the state courthouse a couple of years back. When a federal court ruled that the monument's presence violated the First and 14th Amendments, Moore was ordered to remove it. He did not, and eventually was removed from the state Supreme Court.  Predictably, Moore spoke of a tyrannical government hell-bent (no pun intended) on driving religion (Christianity in particular) out of the country. With the fire and charm of a Southern Baptist preacher, Moore constantly said that he was persecuted for "acknowledging God." That's not entirely true, because as he noted, God has been acknowledged countless times in the Constitution, by Congress, and in Supreme Court rulings.  To that end, it was also predictable that Moore did not mention the Lemon Test, the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, nor did he fully explain the establishment clause of the First Amendment.  Though he seemingly contradicted himself on a couple of occasions, Moore was undeniably an energetic speaker.

            The inaugural award for "Song of the Week That You Never Hear on the Radio" goes to one of my favorite Randy Newman songs, "Political Science." Newman, who is best known for his albums "Little Criminals" and "Rednecks," is one of my favorite songwriters of the last 40 years. His music is complex but easy to listen to, and while his voice isn't the most melodious I've ever heard, it perfectly fits his often-goofy lyrics.  "Political Science" is a hysterically satirical look at America's quasi-fascination with warfare. Some folks in the White House could stand to listen to this song. The lyrics are below.     No one likes us. I don't know why. We may not be perfect, but Heaven knows we try. But all around, even our old friends put us down. Let's drop the big one and see what happens.  We give them money, but are they grateful? No, they're spiteful, and they're hateful. They don't respect us, so let's surprise 'em. We'll drop the big one and pulverize 'em.  Asia's crowded. Europe's too old. Africa's far too hot, and Canada's too cold. South America stole our name. We'll drop the big one, there'll be no one left to blame us.  We'll save Australia. Don't want to hurt no kangaroo. We'll build an all-American amusement park there. They got surfing too.  BOOM goes London, BOOM Paris! More room for you and more room for me. And every city the whole world 'round Will just be another American town. Oh, how peaceful it'll be, we'll set everybody free. You wear a Japanese kimono, baby, Italian shoes for me. They all hate us anyhow, so let's drop the big one now. Let's drop the big one now.

            You know that lady on Court TV? Nancy Grace? I can't stand her. At all. And that's a bad thing these days, because she's everywhere.  I rarely sit down and watch Court TV, but with all the channel surfing I do, I'm probably watching Court TV a total of 60 seconds per day. I swear, Nancy Grace is on at least 59 of those seconds. And now my boy Larry King has her on CNN every single night! WHAT GIVES?! She really bugs the crap out of me!  Her voice is incredibly annoying. Her hair is incredibly annoying. Her complaining is incredibly annoying. Her name is incredibly annoying. Even her nose is incredibly annoying! She really bugs the crap out of me!  Surely I'm not the only one who has noticed how obsessed she is with the Scott Peterson trial. I have no doubt that Scott Peterson is a piece of garbage and likely murdered his wife, but this lady acts like he ran over her dog on the way home from the crime scene. What's she going to do when the Peterson trial is over? She'll have nothing left to live for. I hope she retires and lives the rest of her life in a cave in the Ural Mountains, far away from television cameras, but I could never be so lucky.

            I have a lot of conservative friends. While I disagree with them most of the time, I realize that they love their country and want to see it succeed. The only difference between us is our differing preferences on the way to achieve that success.  And then you've got psychos like Alan Keyes.  Keyes, a staunch conservative and loyal Republican, announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in Illinois on Sunday. Keyes has said some amazingly ridiculous things in the past. For example...when Roy Moore, former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, was ordered to remove a Ten Commandments monument from his courthouse, Keyes said, "What we are faced with now is an effort to set the stage for religious persecution." Look out, Alan! The Spanish Inquisition! They're right behind you!  Idiot.  Keyes  upheld his proud tradition of stupidity on Monday  when he compared his challenger, Democratic superstar Barack Obama, to a slaveholder because of his views on abortion. Obama, like Keyes, is black.  "I would still be picking cotton if the country's moral principles had not been shaped by the Declaration of Independence," said Keyes, who then added that Obama "has broken and rejected those principles -- he has taken the slaveholder's position."  The bad news for Republicans is that Alan Keyes doesn't stand a chance. The good news for all of us is that this probably isn't the last time we'll hear from him.

            I understand that politics is a dirty game, but attacks by conservatives against John Kerry's service in Vietnam are detestable.  Republicans can't argue against Kerry's solution for the George Bush's failed economy. Or his common-sense ideas for the federal budget. Or his level-headed approach to the war in Iraq. Or his commitment to a cleaner environment. So instead, they attack Kerry's heroic service in Vietnam.  Make no mistake -- John Kerry is a hero. The man volunteered to go to Vietnam, volunteered for one of the most dangerous jobs in the war, was wounded three times and saved a man's life -- while wounded, by the way.  So what if Kerry's tour lasted only four months? After being wounded three times, you automatically get to go home. How many more tours were shortened by fatal wounds? Does that dishonor the memories of those soldiers? Of course not.  The argument that Kerry manufactured his military awards by exaggerating his wounds is a farce. None of Kerry's wounds required hospitalization -- thank God! Would Republicans be happier today if Kerry hadn't suffered any wounds at all?  Many Bush loyalists drag Kerry's name through the mud because of his opposition to the war after his return to America. Uh, I don't know if you guys have been reading newspapers for the last 30 years, but the war was wrong. That certainly doesn't belittle the heroism displayed by American troops in Vietnam. They bravely fulfilled their duties. But in the face of mounting evidence, what's so wrong about deciding a military campaign is fundamentally misguided, as Kerry did in the early 1970s? Hell, if anything, his participation in that campaign gave him more credibility!  I've read all the arguments made by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, or whatever it is these anti-Kerry vets call themselves. They are certainly entitled to their opinions. Interestingly, though, most of its members are long-time Republican donors. Also interestingly, none of them served with Kerry.  Most telling of all, though, is the fact that the men who did serve with Kerry have stood by his side through it all, just as he stood by theirs 30 years ago.

            Each Monday (or sometime near Monday), I'll recommend the top episode of "Iron Chef" for the upcoming week. This week's selection is the Spinach Battle, which will air on Saturday at 9 p.m. central time on the Food Network. Katsuaki Mori, a long-awaited challenger from France who specializes in Italian cuisine, will challenge Chen Kenichi.  Who will take it? Whose cuisine reigns supreme?

       "Seinfeld," my favorite sitcom ever, has been out of production for the better part of a decade. In my mind, it's still the best show on TV. I'd rather watch re-runs of that show than any other sitcom on the air today.  Therefore, I was excited to learn that  the first three seasons are coming out on DVD this November . The best two seasons were No. 4 and No. 5, but the early days are nothing to scoff at either. "The Pony Remark," "The Pez Dispenser" and the Keith Hernandez episodes were all in the first three seasons.  I'll still be anxiously awaiting the releases of "The Contest" from Season 4 and "The Marine Biologist" from Season 5, but this will be a wildly entertaining start.

          Barry Sanders and John Elway, two of the greats of their generation, and Carl Eller and Bob Brown, two players whose induction was long overdue, were welcomed into the Pro Football Hall of Fame today in Canton, Ohio.  Brown, a six-time Pro Bowler, was perhaps the most dominant offensive lineman of his day. John Madden once called him "the most devastating football player I've ever seen." Eller, one of the game's all-time great defensive ends, compiled 44 sacks during one three-year span.  Sanders, the NFL's third-leading rusher, quit years ahead of his time and should own every rushing record in the books. He is still the greatest running back of my lifetime. And Elway may not be the greatest quarterback I ever watched, but he was the gutsiest. His punishing first-down scramble against the Packers in Super Bowl XXXII remains one of the most impressive plays I've ever seen.

          To commemorate the 30th anniversary of Richard Nixon's resignation, the University of Virginia released a transcript of a taped conversation that shows  the 37th president kept forces in Vietnam to gain re-election .  The conversation was taped three months ahead of the 1972 election by Nixon's voice-activated recording system.  "We also have to realize, Henry, that winning an election is terribly important," Nixon told Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. "It's terribly important this year, but can we have a viable foreign policy if a year from now or two years from now, North Vietnam gobbles up South Vietnam? That's the real question."  In the same conversation, Nixon admitted, "South Vietnam probably can never even survive anyway," but feared a timely exit by American forces would cause South Vietnam to fall before the November election. To avoid that, Nixon waited until he was re-elected to announce a full withdrawal in January 1973. Two years later, Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese.

       In a setback for democracy in Iraq,  the interim government closed down the Baghdad office of Al-Jazeera , the leading news network in the Arab world. Al-Jazeera has been the frequent recipient of audio tapes from Saddam Hussein (pre-capture), Osama bin Laden, and video tapes of hostages, and then turned around and aired them free of any apparent safety concerns. The network's office was closed for one month for "being the mouthpiece of terrorist and criminal groups."  As a journalist, any form of government censorship over the media is cause for concern in my mind. The only justifiable cause for censorship, in my mind, is when human lives are at stake. And you can certainly make a compelling argument for that in this case. I don't get to see Al-Jazeera's broadcasts, so I have to go on what little I know about this situation from American news reports.  The closure may very well be necessary, but it is a dangerous precedent to set in a fledgling democracy. This is exactly the way the democratic Russian government began to take its now-strangling grip upon media after the fall of the Soviet Union.

       Two of my favorite people in the world, Rebecca Herrington and John Thompson, finally got married today after dating for more than four years.    Clockwise from top left are Mr. Thompson, Mr. Herrington, Mrs. Herrington, Rebecca, and John at the rehearsal dinner at Reservoir Pointe on Friday night.    Me, Lauren Dunagin, and Christina Nesbitt, also at the rehearsal dinner.    Omp meeting and greeting in front of First Presbyterian Church in Brandon on his way to pose for pre-wedding pictures.    Backstage just moments before the wedding begins. Clockwise from bottom left are Omp, Rich Sutton, groomsman Daniel Moore, groomsman Justin Sutton, groomsman Eric Bramlett, groomsman Brad Sharp, and groomsman Adam Gammons.     Omp and Rebecca surrounded by groomsmen and bridesmaids just after the wedding ended.    Omp feeding Rebecca at the wedding reception at the Mississippi Realtors Institute in Flowood.    Brandon High School class of 1999 five-year reunion -- basically, at least. I won't even try to name all the people here.    Me and Omp after I snatched the garter (pictured around my head) with flashes of athleticism not seen since Tommy Bennett's wedding in 2000. After Omp fired the garter, it landed two feet in front of the bachelors gathering. No one moved. And when it became apparent no one was going to move, I dived full-length and snared the garter like Ray Lewis on a loose football.    Mr. and Mrs. John H. Thompson riding off into the sunset -- err, early-afternoon sun. Whatever.

       I hope you're not looking for a job. The Labor Department released statistics this morning that reveal  the nation created only 32,000 new jobs in July . That's 87 percent below analysts' expectations.  More than a year ago, it was the job market that turned me solidly against George W. Bush. I was a cum laude graduate from a Southeastern Conference institution with a resume a mile long, and for the life of me, I couldn't find a job. There were just none available, least of all for entry-level stiffs. The final blow came that summer when Bush announced his second round of tax cuts.  How are tax cuts going to help someone looking for a job? They didn't help me back then, and they don't help people now. I din't have a job, so I didn't pay taxes, so I didn't get a tax break. If I'd had a job, I would've been happy to pay all my taxes.  This president has clearly demonstrated he has no regard for middle-class, blue-collar workers. The sluggish job market is just another example of his failed economic policy.

          The inaugural Sylvester Stallone's Gift to Humanity of the Week -- a weekly spotlight upon one of Sly's innumberable masterpieces -- is the 1976 classic  Rocky . If a better movie has ever been made, I want to see it. This is the story of a common club fighter who get a shot at the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed. Through sheer determination alone, Rocky brings out the very best in himself.  Rocky woke up at 4 a.m. every day to eat raw eggs, run across Philadelphia, do one-armed push-ups, and take medicine balls to the gut. The southpaw slugger went 15 brutal rounds with Creed before suffering a split decision. Creed narrowly avoided an upset and kept his title, even though the final round clearly lasted just 57 seconds. Watch the movie if you don't believe me. Rocky was robbed.  In later years, Rocky married Talia Shire, won the world championship in a rematch against Creed, guest starred on "The Muppet Show," and ended the Cold War. But these are all stories for future installments of Sylvester Stallone's Gift to Humanity of the Week.
