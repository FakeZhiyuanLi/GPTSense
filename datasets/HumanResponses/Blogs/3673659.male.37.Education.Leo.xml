      I hate writing these negative posts. I hate always having my health being the only thing I got to talk about. But BAH! there it is.  You can read details about my trip to the ER yesterday at  urlLink  Playing Doctor: My medical log . Simply put, I was hurling a lot so I went to the ER so I could get fluids, medicine for pain, and medicine to stop the quasiness. And of course, to make sure nothing more serious was going on. All is ok. I feel better today.  Otherwise, I have started doing much work on my domain. Most of the work at this point is behind the scenes, like researching services, installing packages, and getting them running. I have thrown up a really basic index page that links to the stuff I have up and running now. So check it out  urlLink The roar of the L10N . You will find links to this blog, my medical blog, and my forums. I intend to do almost all of my content through my foums, and blogs. I want it all to be interactive. I like discussing things so I hope people will check it out and speak up. With the forums the reader can take the initiative and be the author by starting a new thread. And to encourage dialog I will do a lot of reviewing of things like web pages, music, movies, and so on.  So like what is up???

      I just wanted to warn you that I am actively working on this blog,  urlLink my domain  (where I will be adding my web forums, guest book, gallery, so on) and on  urlLink my partial mirror . It ought to be fun. But if things change from moment to moment or some things are occassional inaccessible, that is why.  =D Never Thirst!

      I purchased a Wacom Graphire 3 Pen Tablet a couple of months back and it just kind of sat in a corner of my room but I finally hooked it up and started playing with it. Its very nice. Its a USB pointing device with a Tablet drawing/mousing surface, a three button scrolling mouse, and the tablet Pen. The tablet Pen has the pen part that you draw with and it has an eraser. Additionally it has a slender button that can do left and right mouse clicks. With tablet aware software (it comes with Adobe Photoshop Elements, some Photoshop plugins, and two other graphic applications) you can draw, write, and so on. Office 2000 and up can use its OCR functionality so that you can actually jot your notes down, or hoenstly write a letter. Here is a  urlLink review  that I found useful.  I doodled some with it last night and in about 5 minutes I did this 5-year old level picture of my sweet cat Shadow (see below). Hey! I never claimed to be a Picasso! Once I learn better how to map out the tablet to the monitor my drawings should start to resemble actual objects.

      a brief Internet chat conversation merged the mundane with the magickal:  mu ShiehS (9:48:48 AM): oops time for more tea Deadevil Frog (9:49:06 AM): caffeine, elixir of the truly evil mu ShiehS (9:53:38 AM): hehe... mu ShiehS (9:53:39 AM): perhaps mu ShiehS (9:53:43 AM): but i like tea better Deadevil Frog (9:53:48 AM): um Deadevil Frog (9:54:06 AM): caffeine is the stimulant which is present in tea, coffee, and of course JOLT Deadevil Frog (9:54:11 AM): silly human mu ShiehS (9:54:18 AM): very little inside this particular tea Deadevil Frog (9:54:35 AM): weakling Deadevil Frog (9:54:37 AM): =D mu ShiehS (9:55:09 AM): i'd rather not get addicted to anything thanks Deadevil Frog (9:59:15 AM): "In the province of the mind, what is believed to be true is true, or becomes true within certain limits to be learned by experience and experiment." mu ShiehS (9:59:23 AM): that is true as well mu ShiehS (9:59:29 AM): but i prefer not to risk it in this case Deadevil Frog (9:59:53 AM): "Everything I like is illegal, immoral, or fattening."

      I, like most Gen Xers, Geeks, Pagans, and Gamers, have seriously hardcore insomnia. This usually means I get about 5 hours of sleep a night because I have a hard time falling asleep and wake up easily. But the past couple of weeks I have reached new levels of insomnia. Insomnia has become a narcotic. I have been unable to fall asleep in my bed lately. So, I have been camping out in front of my computer and tv falling asleep sitting up. I fall asleep at like noon and wake back up around 5pm. Its just freaking crazy! I do this for several days in a row until I finally crash hard and sleep for like 12 hours straight. Then I will go like 2 days without any sleep at all, then I start passing out in front of the computer but can't sleep in the bed, and finally I crash hard and the cycle starts all over again! This is madness!!!  On an entertaining note, on of my favorite cartoon-comedy web sites is  urlLink Weebl and Bob . Its a twisted toon about Weebl (weebl's wobble but they don't fall down) and his friend Bob, and a host of other personalities. Weebl's main pursuit in life is the pursuit of pie. Its a British site so of course its meat pie. But anyway, its some funny stuff. Here is one of my favorite episodes:  urlLink Space Mushrooms . This episode was made by a friend of Weebl who has a nicely twisted sense of adventure! Go! View it! Its funny as hell! And trippy too!  May you sleep well and have pleasant dreams =D
