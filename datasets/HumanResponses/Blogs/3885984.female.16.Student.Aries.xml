      Well guys, I didn't get eaten by a shark, and I have definately returned to reality! VACATION WAS AWESOME! But I must say that I am very happy to be back home. We actually&nbsp;came back a day earlier than we had expected to because well,   one   that stupid little light on the car came&nbsp;on again,   two   I wasn't feeling that well and   three  , I actually kind of wanted to come home! I did have an amazing time though, so that's all that really matters.   Once I arrived in Panama City, I decided to write down some notes so then I'd know what to type on here once I got back home. Yes, I am a dork, but I'm okay with that! LOL Here ya go ...     Day One    We got lost a lot, and I did get a little car sick, (I never knew that I was the type to get car sick!)&nbsp;but Panama City was beautiful and our hotel was right on the bay. Plus, the air conditioning was like heaven by the time that we got there, and there was cable TV! Yeah, life was good. We even found an O'Charley's which is like my  FAVORTIE  restaurant!     Day Two    We went to this place in Panama City called Gulf World, (it's a marine park) and it was so much fun! They had shows with dolphins, sea lions and parrots that were hilarious! They also had other shows and ALL of them were amazing! If you ever go to Panama City, you  must  go there!&nbsp;We also found the Salty Dog Surf Shop, and I got one of their famous T-Shirts. We checked out the bay at the hotel, and believe me, the view was breathtaking! I've never seen so many palm trees in my life! haha And oh yeah, we eventually figured out that we were in the central time zone and not the eastern anymore. I changed my watch, but Grams wouldn't do it so it kind of got a little confusing! LOL Oh yeah, whether it was a road sign, a store or even a person, I was reminded of all of my friends from back home. ::tear:: I missed you guys!     Day Three    Grams wouldn't let me sleep! It was 7:30 in the morning, and she was doing everything possilbe to wake me up! We ate breakfast at the hotel's restaurant, and believe me, if no one has ever told you to not eat at hotel restaurants, DON'T! The food was horrible, and totally not worth the $16.02 that we had to pay for it! Oh well. We also went crusin' around town, and we ate at the Golden Corral, which was really yummy, and cheaper than the hotel's breakfast! LOL We then went to some stores and looked around. The housekeeper read my notes and wrote me a letter!!! It really freaked me out! We came back to the hotel and there was this nicely written note on the table, and so I was like, "Grams, did you like write a poem or something?" And she was like, "no" so I started to read the letter, and I felt a little bad because I had written on my notes how much I didn't like the breakfast at the hotel! But the housekeeper's name was Jane, and by the note, she seemed really nice. She said that she was from Europe, and she asked me what my name was and where I was from. So, I wrote her a letter back and left it on the table. That was pretty cool actually.     Day Four    I'll really miss the view around there. There was this guy watching us as we were backing out and so I waved at him! LOL He nodded back, it was funny. I saw a sign that said, "Gator Heads" and I'm not sure waht they mean by that, but I don't like the sound of it! And please don't tell me that people actually eat Gator Jerky!!! I must say that having cable for a few days was awesome. I watched music videos, some movies, and Boy Meets World! LOL I really liked like one movie but I can't remember the name of it. The whole plot was totally predictable, but I do, as Grams says, have that writer's instinct. Hey, just because something is predictable doesn't mean that it's not good! Okay, now I'm really starting to hope that  Ashden  isn't predictable!   I went to bed at like 8 o'clock the day that we got home. I was soooo tired! Yesterday I got my  urlLink pictures  developed, and I worked on getting them on the internet from one until nine, so you guys better be happy about seeing these pictures!!! I was going to link more things on this entry, but I just don't feel&nbsp;like doing all of that right now, LOL, so&nbsp;if this is boring, which hopefully it isn't, then oh well!   Being back in reality is good, but well, it has its bad points as well. Yesterday I got a message on&nbsp;our answering machine from the yearbook teacher about a meeting on Monday. I had this&nbsp;whole&nbsp;big problem with my schedule last year because they put&nbsp;people who are supposed to be in newspaper in&nbsp;yearbook. So,&nbsp;today I have to call the school and see if they are still having a newspaper class, and&nbsp;if not, then I guess I will be taking yearbook and going to a meeting on Monday from nine until four. Yes, I said&nbsp;nine until four! That's longer than a normal school day! I really woudln't mind being in yearbook, but it's  A LOT &nbsp;of work! I really want to be on the newspaper staff, but I do have this little feeling that they just simply aren't going to have the class this year. A lot of stuff happened last year with newspaper and yearbook ... but that's a  LONG  story.&nbsp;Anyway, I also have my interview at JCPenny today,&nbsp;and I'm really hoping that I get the job! I really think that today is my final test of the summer. I really wanted to work on being more outgoing (which I am, just not at school) and well, today I have to do two things (calling the school and going to an interview) that I would normally freak out about. I think I'll be fine though. LOL This summer I've had trouble with talking to people and them being mean to me!!! I'm serious, at the DMV and at the eye doctor - I always try to be really sweet, but these people were just flat out mean to me! Oh well, I'll deal.   Well, I'll write later. Check out my vacation pictures okay! JKM - OUT!&nbsp;

      Thinking: TOMORROW I'LL BE IN PANAMA CITY! WHOO-HOO!  Listening to: What else? The radio ( urlLink Star94 )  Dreaming of: The beach!  Weather: Heavenly   Hey guys! I can't believe that my vacation is almost here! I've been waiting all summer for this, and I really think it's going to&nbsp;be AWESOME! I've never been to Panama City before, but I LOVE Florida.   Well, I guess I should update you on the happenings in my life. Don't start yawning yet - I've been pretty busy lately, and&nbsp;I LOVE being busy!&nbsp;Last weekend on Saturday, I went to Chili's and to see  The Terminal  with Casey,&nbsp;and for all of you who haven't seen that movie yet - go see it! On Sunday I went to the movies again with my friend Megan, and we saw  King Arthur  - not the type of movie that you would picture me wanting to see - but I really did like it. LOL We got a lil' confused at some points, but since we were like the only people in the theater we kinda helped each other figure out what was going on. On Tuesday I celebrated my best friend Cindy's birthday by going to the Mall of GA. HAPPY BIRTHDAY GIRL! I LUV YA! We had a lot of fun hanging out - that was like the first time that I've gotten to see her this summer!&nbsp;Then, on Wed. I went to the outlet mall with my friend Bekah who is the ultimate boy hunter - I swear, the girl has like a hot guy radar or something! hahaha And that pretty much sums up my week. Now, I'm just sitting here blogging, and then I've gotta go finish packing!    Note to my friends:   You guyz really need to get blogs so that I can link you!!! &nbsp;   GUESS WHAT?  hahaha I know that so many people hate it when you say 'guess what?' I've had plenty of debates about that, but trust me, if I say it, I'm gonna tell you whatever I have to say right after so, don't worry - I won't really make you guess - well, unless you want to or something. I got a call yesterday from  JcPenny , and they want me to come in for an interview next Friday at two o'clock! Yay! For those of you who don't know, I have applied at 12 different places this summer, and no one has called me back until now. I'm really hoping to get the job, but I'm a little scared that I'm going to say or do something stupid at&nbsp;the interview. Be praying for me!   Do you ever wonder where you are meant to live? I mean, you might know where you WANT to live, but what about the place that is exactly right for you? Check out this  urlLink web site&nbsp; I&nbsp;spotted - I found it to be pretty interesting.   Today we decided to go and check out this new store that just opened here called  Ross . Well, when we were riding down the road this lil' light came on in the car, and I looked it up in the Toyota book and it said that you should go to your dealer's. My grams had just gone to get the car checked three days ago so that we wouldn't have any problems while on vacation. Well, we had to wait there for like 45 minutes, and finally, they told us that something was loose and it had probably happened the other day. I was about to get mad if something was REALLY wrong, because man, no one is getting in the way&nbsp;of me and my long awaited vacation! LOL But there was this cute guy who worked there! (Bekah, I really am hanging out with you too much! hahaha) And the&nbsp;problem was fixed and for free too,&nbsp;so ... vacation ... here I come!   For those of you who are shopaholics out there, you really need to check out Ross and TJ Max. I'm a real bargin shopper - one day I could totally write an amazing fashion section for a magazine - and no matter what your style is, you can find something at either of these stores. And guess what??? THEY'RE CHEAP! Most shirts cost $5 and jeans only cost up to like $15! They also have things from really expensive stores! I saw a shirt there that I must have paid like $20 for, and it was only like 5 bucks!!! Grrrrr ... Anyway, God has answered my prayers - he has given me new stores with great bargins. THANKS GOD!   Well, that's about it ... by this time tomorrow (well, maybe by this time)&nbsp;I will be in beautiful&nbsp;Florida! hehehe I can't wait! I'll be back on&nbsp;Thursday for those of you who need to know, (I told you that everyone&nbsp;should have a web site so that we can figure out where people have run off to!)&nbsp;and I'm sure that I'll miss all of you guys while I'm gone. But this girl really needs to have a little fun before school starts back - trust me, I REALLY need it!   So guys, don't forget to relax a little before the summer's over. Sure, teenage years can be stressful no matter what time of the year it is, but you can't forget to just have some full blown out fun every now and then! Partay! LOL I'm such a dork ...  I'll blog all about my vacation probably Friday, and I'll even post some pictures! Until then my friends ... JKM - OUT!

      Thinking: I've got good news!  Listening to: The radio again ( urlLink Star94 )  Dreaming of: Where I'll be in five years ...  Weather: Pretty good, nice and sunny!  &nbsp;  Hey guys! Well, first off, I've enabled comments on here, so if you want, comment away! I'm a little&nbsp;scared though -&nbsp;I mean, please don't tell me that my life is boring or something like that because believe me, I already&nbsp;know that, and I really don't need to hear it from other people!  &nbsp;  Okay, so here's my good news ... I finally got everything organized into my  Ashden  folder today, and I really had no idea how much I've worked on just&nbsp;planning this novel out! I'm pretty proud of it, but anyway, that's not my good news. I went onto the  urlLink Nicholas Sparks  web site today because he has this page that tells you how to write a query letter, and it even gives you a sample of one, and so I thought that it would be something interesting to keep in my file. After I printed that out, I started looking at some of the other things on his site while thinking, " This must be so easy and normal for him... " But then I stumpled upon a page where he has notes about writing all of his novels, and I was reading the one about  The Guardian , and it started talking about how hard it was for him to keep writing when he felt like the book was never going to come to an end and how that this was one of the hardest points in his life because he started to&nbsp;loathe writing! I know that probably sounds really sad to all of you, and believe me, it does to me too, but it's also awesome for me to read&nbsp;at the same time because I've felt exactly that way! It's good to know that even famous authors have trouble writing and even hate it sometimes. After writing  Out of the Ordinary , I started to question myself and then I started to question my writing, which then eventually lead to me questioning whether or whether not I even liked to write anymore. By that point I felt horrible because I knew that writing was my passion, and I knew that it was one of the things that I am meant to do with my life, and so feeling like I just flat out didn't like to do it anymore scared me. I didn't think that was normal, but now that I see that even authors like Nicholas Sparks have felt that way,&nbsp;I feel a lot better.  &nbsp; It's a lot of pressure being a writer, more than some people know. For me it's hard because (well, for one thing, I am only 16) many people that I know around here seem to expect me to be famous&nbsp;some day. At first I, of course, took this as a complement, but it quickly changed to pressure. Someone was saying to me once that they thought that by the time we have our high school reunion I'd have like 100 books published, and well, that just freaked me out! Believe me, I'd much rather go to my high school reunion and have people say, "Hi Jennifer, I've read your BOOK and I loved it!" than "Hi Jennifer, how many books have you written since I last saw you?" That's why I'm working so hard on  Ashden . I've even had a friend at school just nonchalantly come up to me and ask, "Have you written anymore books lately?" I, of course, almost started to laugh, but once I realized that she was actually serious, I kind of didn't know what do say. I guess I said something like, "Well, um, you see, writing novels takes time, you can't just write a novel in a day or a month, and for some people, even a year isn't long enough..." I was just flabbergasted when she asked me that! Do people really think it's that easy - because it's  NOT ! I really don't even think about being famous&nbsp;someday - okay, well, maybe I do ...&nbsp;just a little. I mean, oh yeah, that would be nice, but all I really want to do is write the type of unique book that people want to read over and over again. I think that I can do that with Ashden just because of the fact that the more I plan it out, the more I fall in love with it myself. lol You know you're a pretty damn good author when you can make yourself cry by something you write!  &nbsp;  Well, that's all for now. lol I had to rave - hope I didn't bore you too much! I'll type later! JKM - OUT!

      Hey guys! Well, I wasn't going to write again until I was about to leave for vacation, but I just wrote another poem and so I thought I'd share it with you. This is actually kind of weird for me because my poetry days were way back in 7th grade, and so I wasn't sure if I still had it in me! Here ya go ...   .:.Who I Wanna Be.:.  Here I am, this is me. I'm only mortal, only what you see.  I'm not a super hero, I can't save you. I'm not an angel from above, I can't make miracles come true.  I'm not a model for perfection, I've had many regrets. I'm hardly ever actually right, I've never won a bet.  I've always been optimistic, I won't give up on what I believe in. I've always been a fighter, I won't back down until I win.  So, here I am, this is me. I might just be one in a crowd, but yeah, this is who I wanna be. ***  Do you like it? I'm not the best poet in the world, and whenever I do try to write a poem it always takes me forever! Well, I'll type again before I leave for vacation. I'm kind of hoping I'll have things to do before then - I hate it when summer gets boring! LOL JKM - OUT!

      Hey Guys! Well, as you all know I really like to write stories (::cough:: don't forget to check out my  urlLink two   urlLink books !) But I also like to write poetry. Now, I'm not as good with poetry as I am with stories, but I do love this poem, so I thought I'd share it with you. It might seem silly or even stupid to some of you, but oh well!   .:.Acceptance.:.  She's too short, He's too tall, Her eye-brows are too thick, And his nose is too small. She acts too sad, He looks to weird, Her freckles are too big, And no one likes his beard. Her mouth is filled with metal, He has four eyes instead of two, Her hair is way too dark,  And his eyes are way too blue. She paints her nails black, He always wears a tie, She'll never smile,  And he'll never cry. She won't be noticed, He won't make the team, Her name will never be in lights, And he'll never achieve his dream. Why must we all be judged? Why is being accepted so rough? Why do people try so hard? And why are teenage years so tough? No one should be judged,  No one should hurt from something you say, No one should be excluded, And most of all, no one should be treated this way. ***  Well, that's all for now. JKM OUT!

      Thinking: I should really organize  Ashden  Listening to: The radio ( urlLink Star94 ) Dreaming of: Vacation!!! July 25 ~ Panama City, FL Whoo-hoo! Weather: VERY sunny (I should probably be outside)   I can't find my Mandy Moore CD! I've been trying to find all of the CDs that I want to take with me on vacation, and I can't find it! I'm not the best with actually putting CDs back in their correct cases, but I've looked everywhere. I've got my  urlLink Gavin DeGraw  and  urlLink Five For Fighting  CDs ready though. I never thought that I would like so many different kinds of music. I used to just listen to country, then I changed to christian, and I then moved on to pretty much anything. My friend Casey made me a copy of the Evanescence CD, and now it seems like whenever my other friend Bekah calls, I'm either listening to it or the one song is on the radio. Bekah HATES their song. She thinks that someone's dying or something! lol Anyway, I also like Liz Phair, The Calling, Marroon Five, Ashlee Simpson and Yellowcard. With christian music, I like pretty much anyone.   I strongly believe that everyone should have their own web site. People go out of town all of the time and unless they have a cell phone, there is no way to figure out where they are. lol I'm the one always planning the get togethers here, and I need to know if people are in town!! Plus, it's good to know what's going on in your friend's lives.   I'm really working on two things this summer - well, maybe three. It feels like I've been spending my summer at the DMV! I FINALLY got my license last Thursday, and it was my 3rd try at it. The people at the DMV here are really mean!!! And I am a good driver - just so you know. I've also been working on being more outgoing, which probably sounds geeky and really stupid, but I don't care. I'm really tired of high school because of the judgement and all that crap. Plus, I hate it when people assume that they know you or that they 'get you' and they really don't. Also, half of the people who signed my yearbook this year put something along the lines of, "hey, you're quiet but sweet, have a great summer!" I'm tired of being the quiet girl! lol I'm also trying to become a better reader. I love to write, and I have all of my life - check out my books  urlLink BLEND  and  urlLink Out of the Ordinary  - but I've never liked to read too much. I remember the first books that I ever got hooked on were the Nancy Drew series. hahaha For me, if I'm not interested in a book, I probably won't get past the first chapter. hehehe I should be a publisher or something - I'd be strict! Anyone know of any good books that I should read? I'm going to finish this one by  urlLink Meg Cabot  that I started reading a while ago called, "Haunted." It's the fifth book in her, "The Mediator Series." (which by the way is awesome, you should totally check it out!) After I finish that I'll probably read, "How To Deal" by  urlLink Sarah Dessen . The book I have is two stories in one so it's forever thick, and yes that is the book that was made into the movie How to Deal. I've also been reading a lot of  urlLink Nicholas Sparks's  books lately ( winks at Kevin ) and all of his books so far are great! He's one of my idols! I've even been to his site and looked up his advice on getting published.   Taking about getting published brings me to  Ashden . It's my prospective 3rd novel. I really want it to make it somewhere, and I think that it could if I try my best on it because it's really unique. I'm not going to tell you any more about it (hehehe all you get to know is the title) I'm sorry, but it's top secret! I've been planning it out for about a year now, and I've just recently started to write my thoughts down on paper. I need to start working things into chapters now, but I'm kinda putting it off, and believe me, if you saw my desk you would too. I'm the type of person who will come up with a great idea at a totally random moment, and so I always just jot things down here and there on some computer or notebook paper. Of course, when I actually have to attempt to read my handwriting later - that's a challenge! lol j/k   I get these catalogs from a store called  urlLink Alloy , and I really don't know why they keep sending them to me because I never buy anything, but I thought that this  urlLink sweatshirt  was pretty cool, and it kind of made me laugh because my friends and I are always joking around about being po and not poor. I think it would be cool to find a shirt that says, "I'm not poor..." on the front and, "I'm po!" on the back. lol For those of you who don't know ... when you're po, you're poorer than poor! I think I have like ten bucks right now, but that'll be gone soon because I'm going to see King Authur with a friend next Friday.  Oh yeah -  everyone  must send one of  urlLink these  to their friends! They are so funny!!! Go check it out!  Well, that's enough for now. I'll type later.

      Hey! I have to say that I've gotten pretty tired over the past couple of years of feeling pressured to make my web sites perfect, and I'm a little scared that if I were to start back up with that again, I wouldn't update enough. So, here I am back to the famous blog! I'm not sure if my thoughts are interesting, and it makes me laugh to think of my life as 'intriguing', but hey, maybe you'll learn something from this - who knows, maybe I'll learn something from this!  As I sit here trying to think of a way to sum up my life for you in one sentence, I'm reminded of a quote that a friend of mine and I made up a while back - " I have no life, but I'm a VERY busy person! " That's a good way to put it! I've done some cool things here and there so far, and I hope to add to the list in the future. I love all of my friends more than anything, and I hope to make a difference somehow, someday.  Well, that's enough for now. I'll type again later.

      Thinking: What's my name again? Listening To: What else? ( urlLink Star94 ) Dreaming of: Everything working out perfectly... Weather: So-so  Hey guys! Well, I feel like I'm officially living the life of a junior in high school. I've only been back in school for one week, and I'm already stressing out. Well, first things first - I'm an editor for the yearbook! I'm the ' writing queen ' - or at least that's what my teacher called me. I'm in charge of creative writing and the clubs/organizations, and I'm so excited about it.  Dude, my grams just came in my room, and was like, "Are you done with your homework?" I'D BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A FREAKIN' HOUR! (I'm not done though ... I'm taking a little break!) But no she doesn't come in then ... she waits until I'm done and then comes in and acts like I'm a horrible teenage who never does what she's supposed to being doing. Grrrr ... I'm the type of person that likes to do my homework from one subject and then take a little break before I move on to the next one. My brain will hurt if I keep going non-stop.  Anyway, I GOT A JOB! I had two interviews for Old Navy this past week, and well, I got it! Friday night I was really freaked out about it too because it kind of hit me that  I actually got the job . I don't know why, but for some reason, I didn't expect to get it. I mean, I had the whole interview with JCPenny, and the guy acted like I definately had the job, and well, he never called back so I guess I didn't want to get my hopes up again. I have to go to this orientation thing on the 28th, and that's in like two weeks so I have some time to just be free! LOL And plus, the store doesn't actually open until September 9th, so I don't really have to worry about anything just yet.  I actually really like my classes this year. None of my teachers are like ... well ... those of you who know me pretty well will know who I'm thinking of   :)   I just finished working on two layouts for journalism, and man, those things are hard! I mean, I'm a pretty creative person ... but only with certain things. I also have this project that I have to do for SAT Prep. I have to research a college, and yeah, I picked Brenau. Now ... this brings me to the whole living the life of a junior thing. I really want to figure out - for sure - where I want to go to college and what I want to do with my life! It's hard though! And if I go to Brenau, it's going to cost me an arm, a leg and my right eye to pay for it! I'm po! ( Which brings me to the other day in school ... a girl actually asked, "hey Jen, what kind of care do you have?" I was like hahaha! ) I do think that I'm leaning towards being a journalist more than anything else, but I do worry about whether or whether not it's the right choice for me. I also like the ideas of being a psychologist or even working in a vet's office, (I went to the vet's office here in town, and all of the people in there were soooo nice! I was like awe, wow, I want to work here!) but I really have no idea yet what my final choice will be. I'll keep ya'll posted! And yeah, isn't it funny how the three things that I would like to do with my life have ABSOLUTELY nothing in common? LOL  Well, now I must go and do my chem homework ...  yippie!  j/k JKM - OUT!

      Thinking: Where in the world did the summer go? Dreaming of: An EZ life! Wondering: If I'm going to fail Chemistry Weather: So-so  Hey guys! Yes, today was my first day of my Junior year, and I don't really have too much to complain about. School, is well ... school - nothing more and nothing less. We all have to go through it; we all have to learn to deal with it. My friend even asked called me today after school and asked me if I was nervous about going back Monday, and I was like, "Nervous? No ... But do I want to? No way!" I really want this year to be awesome because well, for starters, last semester of Sophomore year really really sucked! And plus, I'm a Junior now, I've only got 2 more years of high school left, and I don't want to look back on these days and be all bitter about being a teenager. I mean, yeah sometimes it totally sucks, but I'm really working on being more outgoing and being content with who I am and all of that. Yeah, I'm a nerd, I know ... but I'm okay with that! LOL See, I'm making progress already! haha  I actually like my schedule a lot this semester which is awesome! I have Chemistry first period, and although it seems like it's going to be really hard; I think I'll live through it. I mean, if I can live through Mrs. Crain's biology class, I can live through anything! Plus, I have a few friends in there like Megan and the two Nansi's so that's cool. 2nd period I have SAT Prep with Bekah and Nansi (the one who's supposed to be in my homeroom, but ::cries:: they moved her) ... it seems like it won't be too bad, but half of the football team is in the class! 3rd period I have American Lit with the same teacher that I had last year, and I love her! I mean, when I was in her class, I didn't like her too much, but once I was out of it, I just loved her! LOL Bekah's in there too and so are a few other people that I'm friends with so I'm happy. I have "D" lunch! Last year we only had 3 lunches, but they added one this year, and of course, I get the very last one. It sucks too because I don't go to lunch until 1:30, and the class that I have for 3rd period is right across the hall from my 4th period class so I was all like yay, that's awesome, but NO! I have to go from the lunchroom to 4th period which is on the other end of the school! That's just my luck! But 4th period seems like it's going to be fun. I have yearbook that period with people like Juan, Nansi, Heather ... and well, the list of names could go on and on. I don't have any classes with Casey or Cindy, and that's really sad because they are like my two BESTEST friends (don't worry, I love all of the rest of you too).  Anyway, I'm gonna go now. It's been a long day. Hopefully this school year will be fun, awesome and amazing! JKM - OUT!
