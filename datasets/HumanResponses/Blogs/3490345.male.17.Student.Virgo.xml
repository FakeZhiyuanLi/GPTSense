      Millionaire say Got a big shot deal And thrown it all away but But I'm not too sure How I'm supposed to feel Or what I'm supposed to say But I'm not, not sure, Not too sure how it feels To handle every day And I miss you love  Make room for the prey 'Cause I'm coming in With what I wanna say but It's gonna hurt And I love the pain A breeding ground for hate but...  I'm not, not sure, Not too sure how it feels To handle everyday Like the one that just past In the crowds of all the people  Remember today I've no respect for you And I miss you love And I miss use love  I love the way you love But I hate the way I'm supposed to love you back  It's just a fad Part of the teenage angst brigade and I'm not, not sure, Not too sure how it feels To handle everyday Like the one that just past In the crowds of all the people  Remember today I've no respect for you And I miss you love And I miss use love  Remember two days I've no respect for you And I miss you love And I miss use love  I love the way you love But I hate the way I'm supposed to love you back

      I'm not a perfect person As many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you..... And the reason is you..... And the reason is you..... And the reason is you.....  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you   sayangilah orang yang menyayangi diri kamu, kerana orang yang kamu sayangi itu,  belum tentu dapat meyayangi diri kamu!  menerima orang yang mencintai diri kita,  lebih baik daripada memilih orang yang kita cintai.
