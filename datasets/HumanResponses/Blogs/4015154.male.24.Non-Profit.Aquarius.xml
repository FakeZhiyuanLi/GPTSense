      Zach’s Journal  (and some email excerpts from Fairbanks)  5/5/03  Hello all!&nbsp; Here is the first installment of our email/journal to keep everyone who is interested on our time here in Alaska or The Last Frontier.&nbsp; We will take turns writing to keep you on your toes.&nbsp; Please feel free to forward this on to anyone we have forgotten.&nbsp;  Everything is fine and we are doing well.&nbsp; I (zach) started work…that is service, today.&nbsp; My office is downtown in a fine building.&nbsp; We have 8 youth working with us who have just recently earned their GED’s.&nbsp; They are all very excited to be working on the Veteran’s History Project.&nbsp; They are learning valuable job skills and getting paid for it...which is definitely cool.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelly starts work tomorrow at the Presbyterian Hospitality House, or at least is going in.&nbsp; She had a nice tour of the facilities on Sat. and they offered her some choices in her work.&nbsp; She has some exciting opportunities as well.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't say enough about Rebecca and Georjean, our hosts.&nbsp; They are two of the sweetest and most giving people I have ever met.&nbsp; They have welcomed Kelly and I into their home and community.&nbsp; We feel so comfortable because of their efforts.&nbsp; They have introduced us to so many of their friends and colleagues who have in turn extended us the very same hospitality.&nbsp; Everyone is looking out for us from inviting us to church to calling up friends on the spot to find us a place.&nbsp; We are in good hands and feel very loved.&nbsp; I am getting the feeling that Alaskans are very giving and caring folk.&nbsp; They certainly know how to make people feel welcome!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fairbanks is an interesting place.&nbsp; It is a city, but there are no recognizable suburbs.&nbsp; People just come out of the hills or bush.&nbsp; There is a downtown, but there are houses and apartments mixed in.&nbsp; Right now it is a very dirty place.&nbsp; Kel and I have nicknamed it Dirtbanks because all the sand and trash left behind by the receding snow.&nbsp; The locals all assure us that after the leaves come out and trash pick up day comes it will be a lot nicer.&nbsp; Let's hope so!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flight up here was breathtaking.&nbsp; We flew right over Denali!&nbsp; It was amazing!&nbsp; Since being here we have seen 4 moose.&nbsp; It was 10pm and still plenty light to watch them for a while.&nbsp; Also, I am on a quest to nail some red squirrels that have been harassing the house.&nbsp; Georjean got out her slingshot for me.&nbsp; I almost nailed one critter this a.m. after I studied him while eating my breakfast.&nbsp; Just wait.&nbsp; I'll get me one and make you proud, Pop.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  5/9/03  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is Friday the 9th of May and we have to say how quickly this week has flown by.&nbsp; It has been amazing.&nbsp; We have learned so much this week and our senses are on overload.&nbsp; Where to begin, where to begin?&nbsp; By the way, this is zach, so don’t blame any writing mistakes or poor grammar on Kelly.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spent this week getting orientated.&nbsp; There is the whole aspect of learning to get around town and then there is the whole aspect of learning my way around the office here.&nbsp; I must say both are equally adventurous.&nbsp; Oh, and before I go on, for those wondering about my adventures with the squirrel, read on.&nbsp; You will not be disappointed.&nbsp; So, the office…my office is located downtown in a five-story office building.&nbsp; I work for a non-profit called ALPA, which is an acronym for Adult Learning Programs of Alaska.&nbsp; They run a variety of education programs and are responsible for covering over 200,000 square miles.&nbsp; We have staff that go way out into the bush.&nbsp; I hope I can catch a flight with them some time.&nbsp; Anyway, I digress.&nbsp; I am working as the first ever development coordinator of the Veteran’s History Project.&nbsp;&nbsp; ALPA applied for a grant through AmeriCorps to fund my program and here I am, courtesy of AmeriCorps.&nbsp; I am responsible for making the VHP sustainable for the community and ALPA.&nbsp; Right now I am in the middle of helping to train 8 youth in the finer art of interviewing and transcribing.&nbsp; These youth are all high school dropouts who are working towards their GED’s.&nbsp; They actually are getting paid through another grant to work on the VHP to learn valuable job skills.&nbsp; This is an important aspect to this community.&nbsp; Of the eight participants I have 5 teenage mothers.&nbsp; I have to say, volunteering here is one of the best decisions I have ever made.&nbsp; What an honor!&nbsp; These participants are great and their stories would blow you away.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, enough about work.&nbsp; Since we have been here we have seen six moose.&nbsp; They say you never get tired of seeing them and I would have to agree.&nbsp; As far as the squirrels go, I have them on the run.&nbsp; Wednesday morning I was eating breakfast at the window.&nbsp; I watched a red squirrel dance around the yard taunting me.&nbsp; I let him have his fun…then I had mine.&nbsp; I took three shots at him with the wrist rocket.&nbsp; He was about 100ft away in the tree.&nbsp; After the second shot he jumped trees and landed in a spruce.&nbsp; I could barely see him beneath the bows.&nbsp; I aimed for where I thought I saw his fur and let one rip.&nbsp; I nailed him!!&nbsp; I heard that distinct thud and then saw him tumble from the tree.&nbsp; I was in shock, I couldn’t believe that I actually got the sucker!&nbsp; I ran inside to put my shoes on and when I made it to the spot he was, he was gone.&nbsp; Either he crawled off and died, or he is wishing he had.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope he is spreading the word to stay away from Becky and Georjean’s, then again, I hope he isn’t. (I wouldn’t want to run out of targets.)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also at night we have been burning some brush from around the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to stop that though, because it is so dry up here.&nbsp; Becky has an awesome chain saw.&nbsp; Too much fun!&nbsp; (I must be a hick)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I will have to get Kelly to include her side of things next time.&nbsp; God bless until next time!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -zach   5/13/03  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello all.&nbsp; Hope you all had a nice weekend, of course when most of you read this it will be Wednesday, so it goes.&nbsp; Our weekend was nice.&nbsp; We accomplished a lot.&nbsp; This is Zach again, hopefully we will have our internet at our new apartment up and running soon.&nbsp; Until then, I am the only one that has everyday access to the net.&nbsp; So, you won’t have to rely on just my take on things here.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s see…where to begin.&nbsp; It’s always a struggle.&nbsp; Friday night we saw more moose and by Monday night we had seen many more.&nbsp; We have decided to stop counting.&nbsp; I do have an update on the squirrel situation for all those who are interested.&nbsp; We were over playing with our friendly neighbors pet baby geese and I informed them of my little varmint friends.&nbsp; They left the room and returned with a beautiful CO2 fired, semi-automatic, 15 shot pellet gun.&nbsp; It would seem that our little squirrel friends don’t understand the concept of boundaries and have been visiting our neighbors as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; They also have had to pelt some nasty dogs that have attacked their chicks.&nbsp; Anyway, I was thinking that with the use of this new toy these buggers had no chance.&nbsp; Well, to make a long story short, I haven’t seen a squirrel since last Friday.&nbsp; Its like they know that I have a secret weapon.&nbsp; And the worst part is, I am returning the gun today, and I just know that they will be back tonight.&nbsp; Man!&nbsp; I just can’t win.&nbsp; Maybe its all for the best. Right Raluca?  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday night Becky and Georjean took us out to their favorite truck stop for dinner.&nbsp; It is called the Hilltop. It was about 10 miles north of town on the Prudhoe Bay run.&nbsp; Its on top of a beautiful ridge and is the last stop for 160 miles!&nbsp; Better gas up, in more ways than one.&nbsp; I had a delicious chicken dinner followed by the most delicious pie!&nbsp; Great treat.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday Kel and I went to church.&nbsp; Nice place, great people, but not for us.&nbsp; There are some issues we would have about the structure of the church.&nbsp; No need to go into detail unless you really want me too.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday, we came across a baby and mama moose on our road.&nbsp; I went up the hill to get my camera for the perfect shot and when I returned, had the shot lined up, I pushed the shutter and my battery died!&nbsp;&nbsp; My luck…not so hot.&nbsp; Oh, well, its not like I won’t see any more.&nbsp; Ok, got to run.&nbsp; If you want to hear from Kelly let her know at  urlLink kellyst15@hotmail.com .&nbsp; Peace to you all.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -zach   457-2938   5/18/03  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi all.&nbsp; We have come across plenty more moose.&nbsp; I was able to sneak up on a mama moose and get some real close up shots.&nbsp; Once I figure out a way to share the pictures with everybody, you can view them at your leisure.&nbsp; I was thinking about creating a group on msn.&nbsp; What do people think?&nbsp; Any other ideas?&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I last wrote, a lot has happened.&nbsp; I will tell you about the darn squirrels, but let me first update you on our life stuff.&nbsp; We have moved into a great new apartment.&nbsp; Our physical address is 1725 University Ave.&nbsp; #D-66&nbsp; Fairbanks, AK 99709, but we are keeping our P.O. Box&nbsp; which is #72364 Fairbanks, AK 99707.&nbsp; Our new phone number is (907)457-2938.&nbsp; Please feel free to call us and leave a message, but remember we are 4 hours behind EST.&nbsp; Our new place is a one bedroom, but it is considerably larger than our beloved apartment in Quincy.&nbsp; We have ample space to accommodate guests…so c’mon up!&nbsp; We are in a great spot only 5 minutes from the airport and right next to University of Alaska-Fairbanks, which has a beautiful campus.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also purchase a used car.&nbsp; It is a 2001 Suburu Forrester with only31k miles on it.&nbsp; Everyone we have spoken with says it is a car built for Fairbanks and I think they are right.&nbsp; We see so many Forrester and other Suburus up here.&nbsp; It is all-wheel drive and will be a great car for Kelly to commute to work in.&nbsp; I will be taking the bus, which runs a block away from our apartment.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work for us both is going great.&nbsp; Kelly has been working at the youth shelter and getting to know the ropes of how her organization runs.&nbsp; I have met her fellow staff and they are kind people.&nbsp; She seems to be very happy, but is tired out all ready.&nbsp; We went to their prom Friday night, Saturday was trash pick up day around town, and today she is supervising a fun road race!&nbsp; Busy, busy, busy.  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love my work…well should I say service.&nbsp; We conducted our first interview for the Veteran’s History Project (VHP) on Friday.&nbsp; What a blast!&nbsp;&nbsp; The student technicians were all in to it and they can’t wait to transcribe and move on to the next interview.&nbsp; It is so cool to see a spark in someone turn into a flame.&nbsp; Monday I have a meeting in town in regards to fund raising for non-profits.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, so about the squirrels.&nbsp; I had to return the pellet gun so there was no opportunity for a kill there.&nbsp; Wouldn’t you know it, they returned shortly after!&nbsp; So, Becky and I went to the store and bought two “Have-a-Heart” traps.&nbsp; We set them at night with peanut butter and seeds.&nbsp; By the morning we had one…Sucker!&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, as you can imagine, I had a few words with the fellow.&nbsp; I needed to make sure he understood who was responsible for his new steel home.&nbsp; After a good 10 minutes of re-education, you know, stuff like “don’t come back here, there is more where this came from, and next time it will be the sling shot”,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we packed the squirrel into the car and headed out.&nbsp; We drove about 3 miles to a steep hill and we let the guy go.&nbsp; I had never seen a red-squirrel fly until that day.&nbsp; He just zipped right out of the cage and down the embankment and never looked back.&nbsp; Well, since that day we have captured 2 more.&nbsp; I think that this is the best way to go about it.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, not much more to write about.&nbsp; Kelly and I are celebrating a year of marriage coming up on the 26th.&nbsp; I can’t believe it has been a year, but what a year it has been!&nbsp; Thank you to all of you for your love and support we really feel it and appreciate it.&nbsp; We are so blessed to have such wonderful family and friends.&nbsp; God bless you!&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would love to hear from you.&nbsp; Let us know how you are doing.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peace,  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-zach   5/28/03  Greetings from Fairbanks!,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is Wednesday afternoon and I thought that I should write…it’s been awhile.&nbsp; I’m thinking that I won’t send along my entries as frequently as I get settled into a routine.&nbsp; I will be sure to pass along the funny and interesting tid-bits of Alaskan life as I stumble across them, but I won’t bore you all with the details of my work.&nbsp; By the way, we received word that our internet will be hooked up at home by this Friday.&nbsp; Hopefully then, I can get to work on making all of our pictures available to you over the net…and I can get Kelly to write as well…although I shouldn’t be giving here a hard time because she has been sending out “real” letters.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a nice holiday weekend.&nbsp; We had two of my friends that I met in Utah at my training visit us from Anchorage.&nbsp; We went hiking about 45 miles from here.&nbsp; It was a nice hike up to these rock cliffs that you could climb up, or around.&nbsp; Great views!&nbsp; There had recently been a forest fire there and we hiked through half charred forest…very weird, but the way I look at it, there weren’t any squirrels…ha, ha.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We finished the hike by some hot springs, but didn’t jump in because we had make it back home to meet up with some other friends.&nbsp; We’re told that they are better in the winter when you can enjoy their warmth when it is –40 ° out and the Northern Lights are dancing across the sky.&nbsp; We’ll have to wait and see.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So after the hike I went with some fellow AmeriCorps to this bar where a local folk singer was performing.&nbsp; She was awesome and sang about such Alaskan things as dumpster hopping, house sitting, and hauling water.&nbsp; Funny, after she was done, the bar was cleared out and they brought in these cages for people to dance in.&nbsp; I guess there was a big techno crowd that came in after midnight.&nbsp; “Check please.”&nbsp; …not my scene.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday we got up and went to a local organic farm that one of my AmeriCorps buddies works at.&nbsp; What a place!&nbsp; We helped prepare the soil to plant and that meant that I got barefoot and raked the soil.&nbsp; It was sooooo amazing, hear me out.&nbsp; There we were on a hillside, barefoot, raking rich soil in the warm sun while we had the most amazing view of the snow topped peaks of the Alaskan Range.&nbsp; The farm has partnered with the women’s shelter here to help teach people how to grow their own food and give them jobs as well.&nbsp; Very cool.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier last week Kelly and I got up early to help out at the local soup kitchen entitled “Stone Soup Café”… great place that has the idea of providing nice meals to people and trying to get away from the “handout” mentality.&nbsp; They really want to serve people while preserving their dignity.&nbsp; I hope that we can go back…it was a lot of fun and we met some nice people.&nbsp; I can get carried away in the kitchen though…too much fun.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday, Kelly and I played some tennis and saw the Matrix II.&nbsp; It was a great day and a nice way to celebrate our anniversary.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, enough for now.&nbsp; We love you all.&nbsp; Be well.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -zach   6.13.03   Buenos Dias!,  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow, it has been a while since I have last written!&nbsp; I apologize for not keeping a regular schedule, but I saw this coming.&nbsp; Life is marching onward, and I can’t keep my writing up.&nbsp; I will fill you all in on my project as well as life in Alaska stuff.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I must write that it is absolutely beautiful here!&nbsp; Fairbanks has really impressed us with how nicely it has blossomed.&nbsp; It is a far cry from the “Dirtbanks” that I wrote about when we first arrived.&nbsp; It is difficult to understand how one place can have such a dramatic turn around in such a short period of time.&nbsp; I have enjoyed watching all the landscapers out and about.&nbsp; Some days I miss working with the soil.&nbsp; Grass grows so quickly up here.&nbsp; A lawn that you mow today will need to be cut again in just a few days.&nbsp; You could get a nice stripe going up here Uncle Charley!&nbsp; With all the green grass, the wildflowers, and the snow-capped mountains of the Alaskan range, this place has really cleaned up nicely.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My one project this weekend is to make my photos available to you all via the Internet.&nbsp; I am going to use snapfish.com, I think.&nbsp; I will pass along the info. when I decide.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My project is coming along.&nbsp; We completed our 13th interview today.&nbsp; I always make sure to listen to each of the interviews because I don’t want to miss out on anyone’s stories.&nbsp; Let me tell you, there are some characters up here!&nbsp;&nbsp; Each person has such a unique story to tell.&nbsp; We all have stories.&nbsp; Some of the Vets are telling me stuff that just blows me away.&nbsp; Each interview reminds me of what a great country we live in, how far we have come, and how far we have to go.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are looking forward to a visit from Rachel for the summer solstice.&nbsp; We are going to meet her in Anchorage where she is running in a marathon.&nbsp; The drive down from Fairbanks will be awesome, as we will go right through Denali National Park.&nbsp; Hopefully I will have some great pictures to share.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also looking forward to seeing Jeremy, a great friend who I haven’t seen much since high school.&nbsp; He will be traveling from San Diego to run the marathon in Anchorage.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t have any squirrel stories for you.&nbsp; I think that chapter is written and I won’t have anything else to add until we have a place of our own for them to terrorize.&nbsp; I did have an incident with a yellow finch though.&nbsp; I had dropped Kelly off at work and on the way back saw a bird in the middle of the road, lying there, barely moving.&nbsp; I stopped, grabbed my tennis racket, and scooped the poor fellow up.&nbsp; I drove him (or her for all I know) back to Kelly’s.&nbsp; By the time I got there he had expired.&nbsp; But, he was so nice to look at with his brilliant yellow feathers on the wings.&nbsp; It’s little moments like these that cause me pause and to marvel at God’s handiwork.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, its time to sign off.&nbsp; I would love to hear from you, and to listen to your stories.&nbsp; Until then, infinite blessings!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -zach  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;6.24.03   Hello everyone!,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are recovering from our trip, correction…journey, to Anchorage this past weekend.&nbsp; We put 805 miles on the car this weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had an absolute blast in Anchorage!&nbsp; It is such an incredible place set beneath the mountains right on the ocean.&nbsp; You can look across the bay and see these glaciers slipping into the sea.&nbsp; It is quite a site.&nbsp; (I know, I know, at this point you are wondering where the pictures are.&nbsp; Well, I am still fussing with my equipment.&nbsp; I am having difficulties creating the correct format to download my pictures to.&nbsp; I will prevail and there will be plenty of pictures soon!)&nbsp;  We arrived Friday around noontime and we met up with Rachel at the hostel.&nbsp; We also met up with my friend Jeremy and his buddy Jim.&nbsp; Saturday morning we cheered Rachel, Jim, and Jeremy on as they ran the marathon.&nbsp; Kelly and I actually ran different legs of the race with Rachel to keep her company.&nbsp; That night we all went out and enjoyed the city life of Anchorage.&nbsp; The flowers, the music, the sun, the mountains, the food…everything was perfect for our visit.&nbsp; We enjoyed all the festivities for solstice.  Sunday morning we went down to the bay where there is a creek that empties into the sea.&nbsp; There were plenty of fisherman on the muddy river banks trying to catch themselves some salmon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We watched as salmon after salmon were reeled in.&nbsp;&nbsp; These were monster fish, easily 36 inches each!&nbsp; It was the oddest thing to see these fish get clubbed to death after they were landed.&nbsp; I guess this is the way that it is done, because each fisherman had their own special club handy.&nbsp;&nbsp;  On the drive home we enjoyed the view!&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday, it was overcast most of the way and we weren’t able to see the Alaskan range.&nbsp; We drove along side Denali national park.&nbsp; Words cannot describe the beauty of this place.&nbsp; Simply amazing!&nbsp;  Well, that brings us up to date.&nbsp; I really need to get these darn pictures figured out.&nbsp; We miss you all&nbsp; and hope you are all happy and healthy.&nbsp; God bless!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -zach and Kelly   &nbsp;  7/7/03   Hello Everyone,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know, I know, it has been a while since an update and even the last one was a bit weak. &nbsp;I don’t mind the writing; it isn’t a chore. In fact, it is quite enjoyable once I sit down and begin to write.&nbsp; It’s just the whole sitting down and beginning to write thing that I have troubles with.&nbsp; So, here is the latest news from the Last Frontier.&nbsp;  The weather has cooled a bit today.&nbsp; We have been enjoying sunny days in the 80’s, but today the clouds rolled in.&nbsp; It has been overcast and a bit cooler holding in the low 60’s. We have had some breezy days as well, which is a good thing because it keeps the mosquitoes from organizing blood sucking raids on your exposed skin.&nbsp; They can really make your life miserable here.&nbsp; You would not believe the size of some of them.&nbsp; Size is kind of an Alaskan theme.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything is bigger, not necessarily better, but certainly bigger.&nbsp;  Jed and cousin Mary are here visiting.&nbsp; They arrived the 3rd and Kel and I treated them to their first meal at the Hilltop truck stop.&nbsp; I will emphasize truck stop at this point. We wanted to break them in, Alaskan style.&nbsp; You’ve got to love a place where you can order a fine meal, shower, and fuel up in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp;  For the 4th we drove south 60 miles to the village/town of Nenana.&nbsp; It a one paved road town famous for it’s “Ice Classic” and a golden spike that President Garfield (I think) drove in the tracks to celebrate the completion of the Alaskan railroad.&nbsp; The “Ice Classic” is a 70+-year-old tradition where people bet as to when the ice will go out on the Tanana.&nbsp; Its quite a big deal.&nbsp; Last year’s winners split over $300,000.&nbsp; Considering it costs only $2.50 a guess and the town has a population of a couple hundred, this is quite the event!&nbsp; People from all over place their bets with the Nenana Chamber of Commerce.&nbsp; So talk to me next spring when the ice goes out.&nbsp; We guessed May 2nd at 5:26 in the evening.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe we will be the next winners!  While in Nenana we went to the local bar to check things out.&nbsp; All I can say is the only reason we didn’t turn right around is that there was a Red Sox/Yankee game on the tube.&nbsp; (Red Sox pounded the Yanks 10-2, Go Sox!)&nbsp; A fellow VISTA told us that we had to check this bar out.&nbsp; Not much worth writing about, pretty sad really, but one notable was the sign over the bathrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp; “Herpees and Hepees” for each respective door.  Saturday Jed and Mary treated us to a riverboat cruise down the Chena river.&nbsp; Great time with good food.&nbsp; Sunday I took everyone back to the glacier I was at last weekend.&nbsp; Hopefully the pictures of this place that I emailed got you all.&nbsp; On the trip we saw 4 moose, a bald eagle, a naked hiker, and a fox, but no bears.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow the 8th, we are heading down the road to Denali to go white water rafting.&nbsp; I will have to fill you all in later.&nbsp; I know it will be wet and cold though.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Ok, this is all for now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am on the verge of a digital picture breakthrough.&nbsp; There should be a flood of pictures available soon for your viewing pleasure at snapfish.com.&nbsp; I will let you all know.&nbsp; We love you all very much and think about all the people we miss back home (that’s you).&nbsp; Peace and sweet dreams.&nbsp; God bless!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -zach   &nbsp;  7.23.2003  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Dear Family and Friends,  Hello from Fairbanks. Weather is still great although we have been experiencing a bit of a haze. I read in the paper yesterday that there are some major wildfires burning in Siberia. The result here is that our sky has an ever-so-slight haze to it. It really makes for a beautiful sunset/sunrise at around midnight. The smoke and ash particles reflect the brilliant colors of the sun and atmosphere. It is really quite enchanting.  Jed and Mary left us last week after a nice visit. They did some cool stuff in Anchorage, but you will have to ask them about it. It was great to have them experience bits of Alaska. Kelly and I laugh; they have seen more of Alaska now than we have. So the other night on PBS there was this special on Wrangel St. Elias National Park here in Alaska. I learned that there is a glacier here that is bigger in area than all of Rhode Island. How is that for perspective?  The last email I sent out, I tried to pass along some pictures. For whatever reason some people received them and others didn't. If you did not get the pictures be sure to let me know and I will send them out again.  Peace to you all.   3 September 2003  Greetings from Fairbanks,  Gosh, I don't even know how to begin this email. I feel that I have neglected the updates so long that I need to reinvent the process. I regret that it has been so long since I have put some of our thoughts and experiences down.  I'm sure that by now you have all realized that these updates are an exercise that is mostly selfish in nature. It is our feeble attempt to hold onto the familiarity and comfort that is found through family and friendship, both necessities for our sanity as we continue on in our Alaskan adventure. We do appreciate the fact that you enjoy reading these and keep us filled in with your lives.  Some news...The Miller family is growing! My cousins Karl and Amy, or Amy I should say, gave birth last week to healthy twin boys; Riley Benjamin, and Jordan Lucas. Congratulations to them and new grandparents Charlie and Dale. Look out world...the Millers are up by 2! Kel and I can't wait to love up on them.  Here in Fairbanks the summer is making a quick exit. We have had a full week of rain, which, I am told is right on time and typical. It is the watering that lets everyone know it is time to put away the water toys and get out the snow toys. Winter is fast approaching. There have been other signs too. The geese are loudly honking their ways south. The birch trees are turning various shades of yellow...it's the kind of yellow that appears to be uniform in color at a glance, but when you look closer the different shades provide a rich, diverse backdrop. And with all this rain the leaves are falling to their final resting places where they will be covered in snow before long. I find it humbling and yet strange how much beauty there can be in one shade.  We have enjoyed having some dear friends up to visit. Brent visited for 2 weeks at the beginning of August and his visit overlapped with Amy's and Frank's. We all had a marvelous time catching up with each other. We managed to escape from work to do some hiking and camping with them. We helped collect native grass seed a couple hours down the road in Denali Park. The park needed new seed to re-grass their new visitor center. While in the park we hiked around and were able to see some wildlife. We came across a lynx which was about the size of a German Shepherd. It was the biggest wild cat I have ever seen...simply stunning. We saw some caribou, dall sheep, ptarmagin(grouse), marmot(giant squirrel type animals), and a moose. It was an Alaskan Safari.  Later in the week we went hiking and camping on the Denali highway near our favorite glacier. It rained, but we had a blast. Brent's blazing fire and the good company kept us all warm. We were paranoid about coming across grizzly bears all night, but made it through the night without any incidents. I was skeptical about there being any bear around until we came across a hiker with a 30/30 slung over his shoulder. I asked him if he often hiked with a rifle and he looked at me like I was the crazy one for not having one. I said, "There aren't any bear around hear." He said, "Where there are dall sheep there are grizzlies." I said, "There aren't any sheep around here." He said, "Look up." I realized that the rocky slopes above were the perfect habitat for dall sheep. Needless to say, I wasn't too thrilled to have to think about having my face rearranged by a grizzly smack. (Dad, anytime you want to gift me with the 30/30 or 32, I would find a nice home for it...hint....hint) Anyway, we are fine and had a grand time.  Kelly has been out at the farm all week. She is the primary care person, or teaching parent, while the usual teaching parents are on vacation. She has been staying in their apartment so she can get the boys up at 5:30 am and drive them to school 25 miles away. I stayed with them this past holiday weekend and Kelly and I were teaching parents together. We took them to the local pool for swimming and diving and then to Pizza Hut...a real treat. Sunday we took them to our church for the second time. They ask to go back and especially enjoy the fellowship time at the end with the donuts and hot chocolate. Monday we spent at the farm paper macheing and playing football. We are really enjoying working with these boys and being a part of their lives. It is very challenging and very rewarding. It is fun to watch Kelly with them. She is very good and has an uncanny ability to stay a step in front of them.  I don't have much more to write for now. We pray that each of you have your health and happiness. God bless. We love you.  -zach and Kelly  ps&nbsp; A shout out to Zach and Amy.&nbsp; They sent us some cupcakes from our favorite bakery down the the street from our old apartment in Quincy.&nbsp; You guys rock!&nbsp; We love you.&nbsp; Your place or ours next Wednesday?   &nbsp;  9.19.03  Hola,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is this old Sourdough, who happened to also be a poet, named Robert Service who has been celebrated by us Millers for some time.&nbsp; I’m not quite sure how we ever discovered his writings, but whatever the case may be, we enjoy his work.&nbsp; We have, somewhere, one of his collections of poetry in an old book.&nbsp; It’s kind of funny how his stories of Alaska and the Yukon mesmerized me, or at least made my mind race, and I am here.&nbsp; I once tried to memorize “The Cremation of Sam McGee” but only got to the 3rd stanza.&nbsp; I think that this winter I will try it again.&nbsp; Here’s the first stanza…&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are strange things done in the midnight sun&nbsp; By the men who moil for gold;The arctic trails have their secret tales&nbsp; That would make your blood run cold;The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,&nbsp; But the queerest they ever did seeWas that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge&nbsp; I cremated Sam McGee.  If you are interested in the rest of the poem it can be found, among other places, at  urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/poetry/camy13/thecremationofSamMagee.html .&nbsp; He even has a website dedicated to his memory and works at  urlLink http://www.robertwservice.com/index.php .&nbsp; Isn’t the Internet amazing?&nbsp; There is something for everybody.&nbsp; Anyway, enjoy!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelly and I are doing quite well.&nbsp; We have been house sitting for the past couple weeks.&nbsp; We are looking forward to sleeping in our own bed again.&nbsp; I have observed that house sitting is more prevalent of an activity here in the land of the midnight sun.&nbsp; I think that the harsh weather allows for more things to go wrong while homeowners are away…&nbsp; hence the house sitters.&nbsp; It has flurried a few times this week.&nbsp; We went for a hike in the White Mountains here last week and made tracks in fresh snow.&nbsp; Another irony, we left the White Mountains of New Hampshire to come to the White Mountains of Alaska.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the hike…our dear friend Jodi was with us visiting from Minnesota.&nbsp; We wanted to get out of town so we drove the 30 miles north to the Whites. &nbsp;We were on this great hike that took us along a ridgeline.&nbsp; We stopped every so often to admire the views and to eat the blueberries that were clinging to their bushes in their last hurrah before winter set in.&nbsp; Man, were there a lot of berries!&nbsp; So, we go along for a while and even run into the naked hiker.&nbsp; As we are hiking back we run into 2 moose hunters who each are driving 8 wheeled amphibious all-terrain vehicles.&nbsp; We stop to chat, as most do in the bush, and these guys can’t believe we are out hiking without a weapon or in the very least, bear spray.&nbsp; Oh man!&nbsp; They got us freaked out.&nbsp; I mean, here we were having the best of time and then they have to go and give us a conscious.&nbsp; I told them, all know it allishly, that my Pop was sending up a .32 Winchester Special and that on future hikes we would be well protected.&nbsp; Silence.&nbsp; More silence.&nbsp; Then one of the hunters broke it to me kindly.&nbsp; He said that a .32 was a great gun, but for back East.&nbsp; He said here it would only piss a grizzly off and that they would have to dig my sorry ass out from the dead bear after it died devouring me.&nbsp; So then they instructed me on what the proper caliber weapon would be and all the finer details of where to aim at and hopefully hit a charging bear.&nbsp; Before long we parted ways with the hunters and pretty much sprinted back the last mile to our car while all the way singing songs at the tops of our lungs to warn any bears that we were outta there!&nbsp; So, needless to say, for real this time, we are through hiking until we get the proper protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enough about the bears.&nbsp; We have been treated this week to spectacular auroras.&nbsp; As Robert Service wrote, the northern lights have indeed scene queer sites.&nbsp; The first night Kelly noticed them she woke me up and made me come out on the deck with her.&nbsp; I was half asleep as the lights danced above us across the sky.&nbsp; Last night was absolutely stunning and spectacular.&nbsp; Imagine the sky from horizon to horizon over you, dancing with brilliant greens and oranges.&nbsp; At one point the giant type rainbow split and seemingly swirled down around us.&nbsp; I haven’t done hallucinogenic drugs, but I don’t think they could come close to the show we were treated to.&nbsp; I hope to capture these on photos in the future.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not much else to report on.&nbsp; I hope that this note finds you well and in a good place.&nbsp; Peace to you all.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -zach and Kelly&nbsp;   9.28.03  This past Thursday morning we awoke to a ground dusted with snow. Most of it had melted by the time I left work, but there were pockets that remained; in the shadowy places the snow seemed to congregate as if each flake knew that just across the sun line its demise awaited. In addition to the snow, we have been scraping our windshield pretty regularly. Throughout town standing water has iced over. Its that white ice that forms as the water underneath recedes leaving great crinkling targets for people like us to jump on. That never gets old.  This first taste of snow has Kelly scheming. She took me with her to pick out a set of cross-country skis, boots, and poles at the used sporting goods store. She is looking forward to getting out and trying this new sport. I'm pretty skeptical. After 21 years of downhill skiing, I think I will stick to hard boot bindings and steel edges. I do have my eyes on a pair of aluminum snowshoes. We shall see. Kelly is nuts though. On Saturday she skied into the living room in full gear. She said she couldn't wait for the snow. I nearly split my gut watching her try to turn around in our small apartment.  We have suffered our first cracked windshield since having our car here. We knew it was only a matter of time before it happened. It is not rare that at any given red light you can do a quick count of vehicles with cracked windshields and they will outnumber the ones without. There is so much loose gravel around that there is really nothing you can do about it. We'll get the windshield replaced, but it will surely happen again.  I am hoping to go out next weekend for the final camping trip of the season. I know that I said after our last outing that we were done for fear of the bears, but I have tracked down some protection. My hiking friend has loaned me some bear spray. I don't know if this would be of any help, supposedly is works, and at least I have something. Kelly will be out at the farm this weekend with the boys so she will not be able to join us.&nbsp;  Last night Kelly and I went to see the Moscow Chamber Orchestra play.&nbsp; It was a nice treat to be able to see such a famous ensemble here in Fairbanks.&nbsp; They were very talented and we were surprised at how much we enjoyed ourselves.&nbsp; The last encore was a great rendition of Yankee Doodle Dandy.&nbsp; The first chair violinist did things with his violin that I didn’t know were possible.&nbsp; He was a true virtuoso.&nbsp; Good times.  Well, we hope you are well.&nbsp; That’s all for now.&nbsp; May there be peace on earth!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -zach and Kelly   10.16.03  It really does hurt...  So, allow me to try to make sense of this pain in this latest update from Alaska. You see, when Kelly and I moved we knew that no matter how far from home we would be, we would always have the Red Sox.  We left Quincy at the end of April. One of the last things that Kelly and I carved time out for was for one last trip to Fenway to catch a game. It was a perfect spring evening, jeans and T-shirt weather. As we walked down the block to the Wally T stop we talked about how this was probably going to be the last time for a while that we would make the trip into the city, onto the Green Line to Kenmore Square, and up the street to Fenway.  It was bittersweet evening. We arrived at the park early to watch batting practice and for Kelly to get a picture with her other lover, Jason Varitek. The Sox handily beat the visiting Devil Rays and we had a grand time. I couldn't help thinking about what a great thing the Sox had going and that I was going to be pissed if they made it deep into the playoffs the year that we decided to leave New England. And of course, this is just what they went ahead and did.  And I am glad. I am so glad. These guys mean a lot to Kelly and I. They were our constant reminder that, although we were not near, that life in New England, the life that we have so loved, was moving on even without us. To displaced New Englanders all over the world, these boys of summer were and are a piece of home. It didn't take me long to realize that Red Sox nation was alive and well even in the Last Frontier. And I couldn't help but be comforted by this, knowing that Kelly and I would be alive and well too.  So here was our team, on the doorstep of the World Series. It was game 7, and I had a dilemma. Now there will be those who will question my loyalty to the Sox, but I have to tell it as it happened. Kelly and I joined a focus group at church a few weeks back. How was I supposed to know that they would schedule their first meeting during game 7? Kelly was at the farm, so I was on my own. So there I was at the end of the 7th inning leaving Pedro on the mound with the lead to go to a church group meeting. I rationalized with myself that my boys were going to win or lose without me and if I wasn't going to be able to sweat it out with them, at least I could petition the Lord on their behalf.  As I raced home after the meeting to my VCR, I frantically tuned the radio to the sports station. What's the first thing I hear? "Not only is there champagne flowing in the Yankees club house, but also pitching coach Nel Stoudelmeyer has taken some out to monument park to share with Babe Ruth." No need to go on. I couldn't believe it! As I reached to turn off the radio I was not even shocked.&nbsp; How could I be?&nbsp;&nbsp; Pain, yes, oh that is&nbsp;very real&nbsp; But, shock, not really.&nbsp; I know, strange right...not to Red Sox fans...we know better.&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead,&nbsp;along with the pain,&nbsp;I was filled with thanksgiving for the unbelievable season that we were treated to. It was a thrill to be a part of the ride.&nbsp; No hard feelings Grady, even if you should have pulled Pedro sooner.&nbsp;  When I got home there were 4 new messages waiting for me and I thought I would share them with you because they are priceless. Each of the messages is translated verbatim.  Message #1: (Drew from Fairbanks) "Hey it's Drew, it's the top of the 8th, I'm just thinking of you guys. It looks like they are going to pull it out, I think they are going to win. I'm just trying to be positive. Anyway, just thought I would give you a call. Talk to you later. Bye."  Message #2: (Brent from Brooklyn) "Ridiculous! Absolutely fu#&ing ridiculous! Absolutely Fu#&amp;ing ridiculous!!! (laughter of some Yankee fans in the background) I love you man."  Message #3: (Cousin Mary-Yankees fan from NJ) "Zachary, it's Mary, my condolences. What were they thinking leaving Pedro in past the 7th inning? Anyway, figured you would be home but I guess not. Talk to you soon. Bye."  Message #4: (Kelly calling from the Farm) "Hey Honey, I've been trying to get a hold of you. I'm just wondering if you are OK and to see what bar you are drowning your sorrows away at. Just kidding. Give me a call when you get in. Hope you are OK. I love you."  And so I must say that it is an honor being a Red Sox fan and to carry the burden of 86 years without a World Championship. Congratulations to the Yankees, good luck with the Marlins, you'll need it. And to my fellow faithful Red Sox fans. Just wait. Wait until next year.  Love to all from Fairbanks.  -zach and Kelly   10/30/03  Happy Halloween and All Saints Day!,  To all of the living saints who have meant so much to us in our life, we love you!  As we sat in front of the fire and carved pumpkins this past week, I was reminded once again of life’s simple pleasures.&nbsp; As we enjoyed the warmth from the crackling fire, snow fell gently and covered the already hoarfrost trees with a light dusting of white.&nbsp; We have been out at the farm with the boys and carving pumpkins with them offered a welcomed change of pace.&nbsp; Kelly is in the middle of week 3 of flying solo with the boys and so I have been staying out there to help out.&nbsp; Although we consider ourselves blessed to have this time with the boys, we will be happy when the regular teaching parents come back from vacation.  With the Yankees going down in defeat this past week, my mourning period for my beloved Red Sox is officially over.&nbsp; Many thanks to those of you who reached out to me in this difficult time.&nbsp; I would like to especially thank a highly respected professor of mine who wrote to me with these wise words on the matter.&nbsp; “We [Red Sox fans] must be stoic about such things.&nbsp; The earth is still on course.&nbsp; God is still in control.&nbsp; And the Yankees still suck!”&nbsp; I couldn’t agree more.&nbsp;  We have been experiencing some weird weather, at least to Fairbanks standards.&nbsp; We finally got our first significant accumulation of snow this past week with 4 inches of snow that I referred to earlier.&nbsp; The temperature has danced around the freezing mark.&nbsp; The freeze/thaw cycle coupled with the fact that they haven’t plowed has made for some interesting driving.&nbsp; Apparently snow removal is a foreign concept in these parts.&nbsp; I’m told that there isn’t much funding for plowing.&nbsp; Instead they spread tons of gravel over the roads.&nbsp; This would explain all the cracked windshields.&nbsp; I am thinking that the state of Alaska or the city of Fairbanks should monopolize the windshield repair industry.&nbsp; This way they could fund plowing.&nbsp; They could still spread the gravel to ensure business, but at least we would have our roads cleared of snow.  A funny sight that we see quite a bit is that of a dog team pulling 4-wheelers.&nbsp; Because there hasn’t been much snow, dog teams train by pulling around their mushers on their ATVs.&nbsp; It looks like a good time.&nbsp; The neighbors to the farm have a few dog teams.&nbsp; I’m going to make my way over some time to see if I can try my luck at mushing.&nbsp; I once heard a caller on NPR’s “Car Talk” call in and ask Click and Clack if it was better to have a dog team pull an ATV in gear or in neutral.&nbsp; I remember saying, “You don’t hear that everyday.”&nbsp; Now I say, “You don’t see that everyday.”  Well, Kelly and I hope that you all have a great Halloween.&nbsp; Don’t eat too much candy.&nbsp; And take time to remember and thank those saints in your life, past and present.&nbsp; Love to you.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -zach and Kelly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   11/14/03  Well Hello There,  Winter has finally arrived in Fairbanks.&nbsp; As I write it is currently 10 degrees F below.&nbsp; We have had over a foot of snow accumulation, so at least we have the snow.&nbsp; Here is today’s forecast for Fairbanks, “Very cold today with a little bit of sunshine.&nbsp; High minus 6.&nbsp; Partly cloudy and frigid tonight.&nbsp; Low minus 24.&nbsp; Tomorrow will be bitterly cold.&nbsp; High only minus 16.”&nbsp; And it is only November.&nbsp; This weekend they are calling for 50 below!&nbsp; If you ever want to see a live picture of Fairbanks and get the weather report for yourself, log onto  urlLink http://www.news-miner.com/  and click on “ArctiCam”.&nbsp; The camera is only a few blocks away from where I work (which is behind the church and over the river).&nbsp; Every time I go by it I wave in case Big Brother is watching.&nbsp; The fog you see is ice fog that is a common occurrence here in the winter.&nbsp; It is caused by a temperature inversion, which keeps the cold air, along with all the pollution, trapped in the city’s valley.&nbsp; Good thing we live in the hills.  Oh yeah, Kelly and I have moved to a new apartment. &nbsp;We have the same mailing address-PO Box 72364 Fairbanks, AK 99707 and same phone number- (907) 457-2938.&nbsp; We are in a basement apartment of a new home that Becky and Georgean have bought.&nbsp; We love having a big yard and sharing their dog, Shea.&nbsp; My latest project is putting together a toboggan run that starts from our deck and hooks up with a trail next to the house.&nbsp; It would make my Godparents, Garth and Shirley, proud.&nbsp; They would build sled runs in Lake Placid that probably could have been used as Olympic training runs.&nbsp; Great fun!&nbsp;  This past Tuesday we celebrated Veterans’ Day.&nbsp; Because of the work I do collecting veteran’s stories and documents, I was asked to speak at the city’s ceremony.&nbsp; Here is an excerpt I read from an interview I conducted while I will still back East, in Quincy.&nbsp; Veteran Joe Goulart served as a radio operator and gunner on a bomber in World War II.&nbsp; In an interview earlier this year he spoke about how his service affected his life.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what he said, “I guess the simplest way to put it is that I grew up fast.&nbsp; I matured in hours.&nbsp; There’s not a heck of a lot in this life that has fazed me since.&nbsp; I can take just about anything because it puts things in perspective. And still this day I am probably one of the most patriotic people you will ever meet.&nbsp; I cry at parades then I just thank God I had the opportunity to live in the time I lived and make the contribution I made.&nbsp; I am not a hero.”&nbsp; Joe went on to talk about the experience of sitting down with us from the Veterans History Project for an interview.&nbsp; He said, “What you are doing I think is very important because the guys in my generation aren’t talking about it and if you can make them talk like this and get a real picture here, I think we are going to find out a lot more about this generation of mine.”&nbsp; If Joe were here today I would tell him we have learned much from his generation and that we have so much more to learn.&nbsp; Each generation of service men and women have a lot to teach us.&nbsp; They teach us to be thankful for each day we enjoy in freedom.&nbsp; So, I stand here today, this Veterans Day, and offer my gratitude to each Veteran past and present.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; If you didn’t this past Veterans’ Day, be sure to seek out someone who has served and thank them.  Let’s see, what else?&nbsp; Kelly is doing well.&nbsp; She finally did get out and use her skis outside.&nbsp; She informed me that the skiing was better outside than it was in our living room.&nbsp; I’m glad she got that figured out.&nbsp; She will be at the farm this weekend.&nbsp; I will make it out there at some point.&nbsp; A few weeks back, when the snow was still wet, I challenged the boys to see who could roll the biggest snowball.&nbsp; They set right to work and before long they each had massive mounds of snow that they could no longer push without help.&nbsp; We brought each of them together and stacked them as high as we could.&nbsp; Although it was the sorriest looking snowman I had ever seen, it sure was the tallest.&nbsp;  Well, that’s about it for now.&nbsp; We sure do miss you all.  -zach and Kelly&nbsp;   12/1/03  Goeie More,  This is “hello” in Afrikaans, a language spoken in South Africa.&nbsp; I only mention this because today is World AIDS Day.&nbsp; This deadly pandemic has cut the life expectancy of a South African by 32 years, from 68.5 to 36.5 years.&nbsp; This is just the country of S. Africa.&nbsp; The UN has recently highlighted Asia as the continent poised to pass Africa’s already absurd HIV infection rates.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please consider what you can do, large or small, to help ease the pain of a world under the chokehold of this virus.  OK, now that we are all smiling, happy people…how’s it going?&nbsp; For all two of you who have been counting, it has been 17 days since my last email.&nbsp; My buddies Garrett and Brent have assured me that these updates have not worn out their welcome despite my insecurity that they have.&nbsp; In case they have there is always the “block sender” feature found on most email providers.&nbsp; Silencing Zach is only a click away.&nbsp; I’m sure some of my family members and former professors would have loved a live version of this feature.  As I write it is negative 25 degrees F outside. The cold temps are good for the toboggan run; the sides get nice and solid.&nbsp; I was in the yard yesterday working on it.&nbsp; A moose had walked right through turn number 3 and it needed some repair.&nbsp; We have moose in the yard quite a bit, they come right up to the windows to check in on us.&nbsp; It comforting to know they care.&nbsp; The ice fog is getting to be a nuisance as the temperatures drop.&nbsp; At a red light it only takes a few exhaust pipes to limit visibility to a few yards.&nbsp; It is pretty absurd and I find myself chuckling quite a bit because of it.&nbsp; A friend visiting from Anchorage this past weekend was shocked at how quickly exposed skin goes numb in this cold.&nbsp; It doesn't take long, but one learns how to bundle up.&nbsp; We aren't about to let the cold ruin the few hours of daylight we have to play in.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was nice Thanksgiving here at the AK Millers.&nbsp; We had 11 for dinner.&nbsp; We invited a potpourri of our friends over for a big feast.&nbsp; We all gave thanks for each other and our families.&nbsp; Following the meal we all headed out the back door to the toboggan run.&nbsp; The track was slick and folks&nbsp; kept busting out of the turns and making their own runs.&nbsp; There is a certain joyous feeling that came over me that can only be replicated when the conditions are right.&nbsp; I experienced it often on late winter nights outside in NH and now again here in AK.&nbsp; It's when your surrounded by crunching snow, shining stars above, crisp air, cheeks burning red, and your breathing which alternates between frozen nostrils and warm puffs of exhale.&nbsp;Today we received a package from the Miller Thanksgiving in RI.&nbsp; After we made our way through the cookies, sweets, a beautiful watercolor from my cousin Corinne and Dan's Isabel, a kite (more on that), a note from cousin Corinne, pie crusts, there was a home video.&nbsp; My cousin's Karl and Amy's twin boys, Jordan and Riley with Isabel's dancing warmed our hearts.&nbsp; Thanks family for the thoughtfulness!&nbsp;Ok, that's about it for now. Oh yeah, the kite...Corinne, I don't think there will&nbsp; be any pictures of the kite flying high in Alaska.&nbsp; There hasn't been much wind lately.&nbsp; Perhaps I will take it up when I catch a flight into the bush.&nbsp; I will hold it out the window and get a shot of it then.&nbsp; That will do.&nbsp; Until then, the kite is still broken.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, and my Sox signed Schilling!&nbsp; We are bringing home the bacon next year baby!&nbsp;Peace to you.&nbsp;zach and Kel&nbsp;   12/9/03  Hi All,  We are experiencing a bit of a heat wave. The mercury was hanging out around 15 degrees above this morning. I didn't bother with my coat when I put Shea out on his run. Not bundling up threw me off. Over the past couple of months I have developed my own thermometer of sorts. It is based on how many steps away from getting the dog or putting the dog on the run before I begin to trot, or even run, to get back inside to the warmth. This morning was a stroll the whole way back, even without a coat. Last week was a world record sprint. It was 35 below, 45 below in town.  Our neighbor came by for a visit the other day. He asked us if we had seen one of the twins. He was concerned because it had been a few days since he saw both of the offspring of the moma moose that hang out in the neighborhood. We told him that we have not seen any of them lately, although the yard is filled with their tracks. Hope he/she is doing ok. It is the time of the year when last year's young go off on their own. I have a sneaky suspicion that at least one of them feels the need for speed because the tracks go right down a section of the toboggan run. Hope they didn't scare themselves off.  Speaking of the toboggan run, it is just plain sick. It is nearing its full-length completion. In all it is about 250-300 yards in length from top to bottom. I will do my best to describe it, but it will sadly note what thrills wait for those who climb aboard and ride the 7 slats of red oak down the shoot. The start begins at the top of the steps down to our apartment on our driveway. Kel and I piled up snow and you begin about 5 ft. above the driveway. Immediately out of the start you rush down Dead Man's Drop, which is really the 15 steps leading down the deck into the front yard. This drop is necessary to carry you the 100 ft. or so across Preparation H, a flat section of the yard. The name was coined for the pain in the bumb you experience after Dead Man's Drop and to remind the rider to prepare for what's to come. The end of Preparation H sends you into turn #1 dropping you into the heavily wooded section of the run named The Grove. Awaiting are 3 quick succession turns created to avoid the trees as you drop down a small hill. This is where the moose like to hang out, so it's best to walk through the course before the first run. At the narrowest point it is 30 inches between twin 10 inch birch trees, but the walls of snow safely guide you through. As you emerge from the grove you are sent into a 100 ft. turn that aligns you with the power line that runs the edge of the property. We have yet to name this turn or the remainder of the course. We will wait for a friend to make a fool of themselves and appropriately name that section. After this turn it is a strait shot for about 125 yards. You pick up speed the entire way. At the bottom of the hill you are whipped around the final turns, up a small hill, and into the brush I have failed to cut thus far. When I do you will be able to coast down another little hill onto a public turn out with killer views of Fairbanks and Denali looming large behind. My buddy Neil thinks that we can fix it so that a pick up truck can be waiting with the tailgate down and the toboggan can slide right in. Then we could be hauled up the road and back up to the house for another run. There are plans for a half way hut/igloo that we could run power down to for tunes and hot cocoa. I know, rough life, huh...now if you could all be here to enjoy...  Ok, there is other life here, but I thought that the toboggan run would be a bit more entertaining. I am going to try and take a video camera down the run, but I have yet to find someone willing to lend theirs out. I don't get it. I guess I will have to settle for taking stills. That's all for now. We love you.  -zach and Kelly  ps. I have some photos of December in Fairbanks that I would love to share with curious folks. Please drop me a line. I'm not begging for email, although it is great to hear from you, it's just easier to send out pictures to individuals than it is to a whole group. My computer gets angry with group picture mailings.

We saw the glory with our own eyes, the one-of-a-kind glory, like Father, like Son, generous inside and out, true from start to finish." -excerpts from the Book of John (The Message)  Merry Christmas,  Hope it was a good one, whatever that may mean to you. We enjoyed ourselves here. Jed arrived on Monday and will be here through the weekend. It has been so nice to have him here. He brought with him 101 hugs from home and they were well received. We will send him back with 101 more. It will be a hug-a-thon via Jed. It will be great. Call to inquire where Jed will be near you next...sounds like a commercial.  Jed also brought with him more light, which follows the Christmas spirit. He arrived on Monday the 22nd, the day after winter solstice. That day the sun blessed us with its presence for a whopping 3 hours and 42 minutes, not very much light. However, around town and in this household there was much rejoicing. With the passing of the solstice we are now riding this rock we call earth on an orbit that brings our hemisphere more light with each day. On Monday we gained 2 whole seconds of light from Sunday. As we approach the vernal equinox we will gain light in larger increments each day. Past the equinox we will still gain light until summer solstice, but it will be incrementally less of a gain each day. Thus concludes today's science lesson.  Our plight with the light could be worse. In Barrow, the northernmost village in Alaska some 500+ miles north of us, the sun set on November 19th and won't rise again until January 23rd. For a cool time-lapse picture of the sun's path on the winter solstice in Fairbanks, check out this link  urlLink http://www.hprcc.unl.edu/nebraska/fairbankswintersun.html . I think these images were taken from the building I work in.  Let's see, what else? The children from our church put on their Christmas program last Sunday night. Kelly and I had plans to go, but you know, the best-laid plans of Kel and Zach often go astray. Although, we did deliver the cookies we promised for the post production fellowship time. The reason I mention all of this is because in front of the church we were introduced to one of the wonders that emerge in Fairbanks in the winter. We watched in awe as artists used chain saws, chisels, and irons to put the final touches on a beautiful nativity scene...all in ice. Mary and Joseph stood, or knelt, 7 ft high. The spotlight behind the sculptures illuminated the scene in a magical way. They were beautiful! Other sculptures with different themes have been popping up around town. They are even putting the finishing touches on an ice hotel. The fire marshal halted construction on the hotel a few weeks ago. Apparently there were some fire concerns...go figure. But now construction is up and going again and they hope to rent out the first room early in the New Year  The toboggan run has benefited from Jed's engineer's eye. He suggested that we break down a couple of walls that were fun ride, but sapped speed from the sled. After some shovel work we were treated to the fastest runs yet.  Nice "chatting" with you. We love you all dearly. Until next time...  -zach and Kelly  "Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius.&nbsp; Love, love, love, that is the sole of genius."&nbsp;&nbsp; - W.A.&nbsp;Mozart&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   1/15/04  I don't know where to begin. This is what I get for neglecting to write. I have a logjam, make that an icejam, of thoughts in my head. A wise teacher I knew often elicited conversation by saying, "Come on folks, jump in, the water is warm!" These updates from Alaska are all about connecting and feeling connected to distant friends and family. This is my therapy so thanks for the couch. Miles may separate us, but the communion found in writing this update warms my soul. See, I knew I just had to jump. The water is warm.  Speaking of warm water...we have spent some time in the Chena Hot Springs, some hot springs about 60 miles east of Fairbanks. "The Farm", where Kelly works, is half way there. We took the boys with us and headed further up the road. At the end of the road are Chena Hot Springs Resort and Ice Palace. Beyond are endless miles of Alaskan wilderness. If you continued East it would be a good 300 miles before you crossed the Yukon river on into Canada and who knows how many miles more before any sign of civilization. Yeah, it's the sticks.  The Ice Palace just opened up. I think I wrote last time about how the fire marshal had halted construction for a time. I still can't get over that. Anyway, the palace has 8 rooms and everything in those rooms is made out of ice. People pay crazy money to stay there...no thanks...I'll stick to my comfy bed.  We rang in the New Year out at the farm. We hosted a party and all of the other homes from Kelly's organization were in attendance. We made a huge bonfire, only one person caught on fire. He was a spouse of an employee, so it was all good, no harm done. Thankfully clothing doesn't burn too well at 20 below. Otherwise the evening was incident free and we all had a great time.  This morning on the way to work I creamed a full bag of trash that I watched fly out the back of the back of the pick up truck I was following. I watched the whole thing happen. It seemed to be in slow motion. When you get behind a pickup in Alaska you learn quickly to watch out for loose loads. I quickly spotted the loose trash bags, but once this one went airborne, I guessed wrong as to which direction it would slide once it hit the pavement. I had to straddle it at the last moment. Since the bag went airborne, more than likely it was only light trash goods. I don't think it was pretty for the driver behind me, having to drive through the debris that exploded out of the bag once I hit it. It made for an interesting commute.  The sun is up for just under 5 hours now. We are definitely on the upswing. I won't lie; I'm pretty pumped that we are gaining light with each day. It's been so dark. It is a daily battle to get off my bum and get out to play. I have managed to do some work on the toboggan run. I have lengthened the starting area so that it is now possible to give riders a running push start. We have yet to test it and the effects the new speed will have on the first couple turns. I foresee some spectacular bailouts in the very near future.  Today, while I was out and about with my headlamp on, I was encouraged to find a fresh set of moose tracks down below Kelly's Grove on the toboggan run. We haven't seen the moose lately and it is nice to know that there is at least one still in the neighborhood.  And then there are the squirrels. Yes, those squirrels, from this past summer. Remember I wrote about how we finally trapped a few and relocated them? Well, this was before we knew that we would be living in the apartment we have now. This new place is right up the hill from where we set those critters free in June. I just know they are sitting out there planning their revenge. And so it continues...  Happiest of New Years to you. Much love. God bless.  -zach and Kelly  "Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius.&nbsp; Love, love, love, that is the sole of genius."&nbsp;&nbsp; - W.A.&nbsp;Mozart&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  1.29.03  Howdy,  Last week, while I was making improvements on the toboggan run, I had a startling encounter. I could probably write about it in a paragraph or so, but what fun would that be?  The toboggan run is a funny thing. It calls to me; I hear it whispering and inviting me to groom it some more. Sick, I know. It's my masterpiece, albeit a masterpiece in progress. It can always be improved upon, but its pretty darn good. It has a personality, an identity of its own. How do I know this? Because I think about it when I am away. I miss it when life's other matters keep us apart.  The changing conditions keep me on my toes, or at least busy. Each new day brings new challenges. Somehow the course fosters a bit of an obsessive behavior in me. Every time I bundle up to go play, I must improve upon what I walked away from the day before.  Each day the run carries me down differently. Changes in temperature, humidity, and snowfall all contribute to how the ride is going to be. For instance, I have found that the fastest, slickest runs occur when it is cold (-20 or below) and the run is packed down and hardened. New snow is a real drag, literally. It takes a lot of shoveling and many runs to get the course up to speed.  Last week, after a couple of runs, I had come to the conclusion that I could make the run faster if I moved Preparation H over to the left by about 4 feet or so. I set out on the arduous task of moving the walls over. Before I began, I took one last run down the track to solidify my plans and to have a fresh idea of where I wanted the new section of track to go. At the bottom of the run I was startled by what sounded like the napping of a twig. I looked around and had to consider that my time might have come...I may have heard the precursor to a massive squirrel assault. I quickly scanned the tree line. With no squirrels in sight, I shrugged the sound off as perhaps a tree creaking in the cold Alaskan air.  I hiked my way back up the course. Snap! Another sound startled me. I was just below Chrissy's Corner or about halfway back up the course. At this point, not only was I thinking about a mob of angry squirrels, but I was also worried about a ticked off moose. I scanned the tree line...no squirrels. I scanned the woods...no moose. Humph! What's the deal? Decision time. I could either stand in the cold, contemplate what made the sound and get really worked up about it, or move on and dismiss the sound as my jacket and snow pants rubbing together. I chose the latter.  For the next 20 minutes I worked hard on rearranging Preparation H. My adjustments to the course lined the toboggan up for a quick smooth run through Kelly's Grove. Before, there were 3 quick turns that snapped a lot of the speed from the sled before it glided into Chrissy's Corner. I was pretty consumed by the task at hand. Despite the cold, I broke a sweat. I worked at a feverish pace with my back to Kelly's Grove. Then, I heard it... It was an unmistakable "snap" of a breaking tree branch and it was right behind me. I froze. My "fight or flight" mechanism was in full force. I prayed that when I turned around I wouldn't be confronted with an army of teeth glaring squirrels, bent on revenging me for displacing them earlier this summer. Well, it wasn't an army of squirrels that had crept up to me. No, it was the moose! Not more than 25 feet away stood Momma moose and Junior right beside her. I caught her eye, and she had mine. I was frozen, I didn't want to scare her, or worse, Junior. Moose, particularly mother moose, can be very dangerous, especially with their young around. There are many stories of folks being charged, kicked and trampled by worked up mommas. I didn't want to be a story.  It was easy to see, as they continued to chew on their branches, that these two were not as freaked out as I was. As I stood frozen they circled the dogwood and munched on their afternoon snack. All of this right in front of me! I was confounded why these two were not on alert like I was. As I thought about it, why should they be? They were the ones who snuck up on me while I was in my own little world, making a racket while shoveling away at the toboggan run. They were the ones who alerted me to their presence by snapping some of the low branches right behind me. Its as if they were saying, "You-hoo...hey you with the shovel...just wanted to let you know we're here. We're just going to help ourselves to these yummy trees you have here. Thanks." Apparently they had been trying to get my attention for a while.  I relaxed a bit. I just stood there and found myself talking to them. I was so excited to have moose back in the yard. It had been a while since we had last seen a mother with her 2 young. Perhaps this was the same mother minus 1 calf. We occasionally say their tracks in the yard, but we hadn't caugt sight of them. Anyway, they were back and I wanted to let them know I was happy about it. I told them not to be such strangers and that they were welcome to come by anytime. For a moment I was Dr. Doolittle.  After I had a good visit, I ran inside and grabbed my camera. I rushed back and followed Momma and Junior around the yard as they munched away. I got some decent shots, but most of them are pretty lousy because of the low light and my unsteady hand. National Geographic won't be calling soon. At times, I was much closer to Junior than Momma was. Junior has to be almost 2 years old. He/she was most likely born in the spring of 2002. After reviewing the pictures I was clued in as to why Momma let me get so close. She was clearly pregnant! This is the time of year that a mother moose begins to detach from her 2 year old, sometimes twins, in preparation of leaving it to give birth and to care for her newborn. This explains why she could have cared less if I was so close to Junior.  I will not soon forget my run-in with Momma and Junior. It was exhilarating to be so close with such large and wild animals. I'm thrilled that they allowed me to share a bit of the their afternoon with them.  Kelly says I need to cut this one off. So, I will wish you and yours peace and be on my way. Love to you from Alaska.&nbsp; Go Pats!  -zach and Kelly&nbsp;   2.12.04   Yeahhhh Patriots!&nbsp; Boob, I mean booo Janet.&nbsp; Now if the Red Sox could just …   Strange weather we have been having here in Fairbanks.&nbsp; It feels like it is sugaring time.&nbsp; If there were maples around, I would be tapping them.&nbsp; A new record high was set yesterday.&nbsp; It reached 41° F at the airport, 46° F was the unofficial high.&nbsp; Here at the homestead we enjoyed a few runs on the toboggan in our long sleeved shirts. &nbsp;People around town were driving around with their arms hanging out the window.&nbsp; Its mind boggling to think that last week it was 86 degrees colder!&nbsp; I just love the feel and smell of the air as it moves across the snow.&nbsp; As it moves past your face your skin senses the different temperatures.&nbsp; Add the sound of the wind in the trees and the bright stars above and that’s about all I can handle.&nbsp;&nbsp;   There is still plenty of white stuff and the town is getting ready for a big weekend.&nbsp; Saturday is the start of the Yukon Quest, considered to be the “Last Great Sled Dog Race”.&nbsp; This is the year it will start in Fairbanks and end in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory.&nbsp; The race’s starting and end points alternate between FBKS and Whitehorse each year.&nbsp; The trail is over 1000 miles long and follows sections of the Yukon.&nbsp; I have sighted teams preparing their food drops to be flown out to various parts of the course.&nbsp; The race will start on the river downtown, about 3 blocks up the river from my office, but Kelly and I will miss this start.&nbsp; We will be enjoying a weekend away in Anchorage visiting friends and getting out of town for a change.&nbsp; I will have to wait until later this spring for other races to get some good pictures.   Our igloo/ice cave is now complete.&nbsp; Last weekend my buddy Neil came over to test his winter camping skills.&nbsp; He pitched his tent in the back yard next to the massive mound of snow I had piled up the previous weekend.&nbsp; After he was set up, we set to work on hollowing out our shelter.&nbsp; Five hours later we were inside our snow creation admiring our handiwork while listening to Dylan coming through the radio we wired in.&nbsp; The shelter is set to sleep five comfortably and host many more for hanging out.&nbsp; The interior temperature stays right around 32°, weather it is -10° or +45°.&nbsp; In the next few weeks we will be interior decorating with more Christmas lights, Styrofoam padding (for the bum), and whatever else we deem worthy.&nbsp; Each of our guests have exhibited the same reaction when they enter our snowy shelter, something like this… “whoh, this is too cool!”, followed by lots of laughter and a big smile.&nbsp; Heck, I’m smiling just writing about it, hope you are too!&nbsp; There are plans for a sleep over in the near future.&nbsp; I’ll keep you posted. (Neil informed me he was nice and toasty when I checked in on him in his tent the following morning.)&nbsp;&nbsp;   Things are starting to get busy for us.&nbsp; We have really enjoyed coaching our 5-8th grade girls’ basketball team.&nbsp; Kelly has enjoyed her social work course and keeping a step ahead of the boys at the farm.&nbsp; I have started teaching a new group of students all the finer points of oral history.&nbsp; I love hearing new stories each day.&nbsp; They remind me how alike we all are, even if we try our darnedest to convince ourselves otherwise.&nbsp;   We would like to send a shout out to cousins Jerry, Margaret and family as they welcome Katherine Virginia into the family.&nbsp; Congratulations!&nbsp;   Also a shout out to Petra Oprean.&nbsp; It was a pure joy to speak with you on the phone.&nbsp; May the rest of your visit to America be blessed!&nbsp;   Much love!   -zach and Kelly   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Now on an entirely different note, allow me to share with you an experience I had tonight.&nbsp; Dr. Petra Oprean had called and left a message on our machine.&nbsp; Kelly stayed with Dr. Oprean, his wife Dr. Anca, and his daugher Raluca while she studied in Romania.&nbsp; During my very short visit and stay with the Opreans, Petra and I experienced a close bond.&nbsp; Kelly tells me she will never forget watching Petra and I pass an entire evening bonding, laughing and gesturing, while neither one of us spoke a lick of the other’s language.&nbsp; It was an incredible experience and one that I will not soon forget.&nbsp; Dr. Oprean was   &nbsp;   3.25.04   It’s been a long time.&nbsp; I have so many words and thoughts waiting to bubble up out of me.&nbsp; I don’t know why I wait so long to write them down.&nbsp; This is therapy and I have been skipping out on my sessions.&nbsp; But I’m here now, and here it comes.&nbsp; I’m comforted to know that you will be reading this soon after I click “send”.&nbsp; So, hello again friends!   The past weeks have been full of sadness and yet, renewal for us.&nbsp; Kelly and I each lost a grandmother.&nbsp; Their passing reminds us that we cannot escape this world with the bodies we occupy.&nbsp; They will inevitably fail us.&nbsp; But, we can leave everlasting impressions on each other’s souls.&nbsp; We give thanks for our grandmother’s lives and how they helped shaped who we are today.&nbsp;   Renewal is evident everywhere.&nbsp; Spring is busting out all over.&nbsp; We have experienced some days above freezing and there are some bare spots coming through, but the truth is in the sunlight.&nbsp; Today we are enjoying 12 hours 43 minutes 57 seconds of it!&nbsp; We gain about 7 minutes each day.&nbsp;   I have been taking my cross-country skis into work.&nbsp; The frozen Chena River and its sloughs are ideal for getting some mid-day gliding exercise.&nbsp; On Monday I forgot my poles, so I had to improvise.&nbsp; Some young saplings left as markers from the weekend’s dog sled races worked nicely.&nbsp; I’m sure I looked silly, but I have never been one to fret about that.&nbsp; I got some chuckles and jeers from the regulars that hang out down in the slough, my buddies, the homeless drunks.&nbsp; (When I arrived I had no clue what a slough was.&nbsp; It’s a natural wandering of the river, sort of like a canal.)&nbsp;&nbsp;   Their plight is pretty sad, really.&nbsp; Rarely do I hear an original story from them.&nbsp; Most are Native Athabascans who have made the trip in from their villages in search of work or anything different that Fairbanks might have to offer.&nbsp; They find that the same problems they had in the villages follow them to the city.&nbsp; What I find most disturbing is that these people rarely have been given any opportunity to make decisions in their life that will bring about positive change.&nbsp; Successful education and support systems for these people are grossly inadequate and I’m pretty sure that even if they were adequate it wouldn’t make much difference.&nbsp; For these people it’s not a matter of working harder.&nbsp; It’s not a matter of trying harder.&nbsp; They are up against greater things.&nbsp;&nbsp; Racism, for one, but the more dominant force is the clash between two totally different cultures.&nbsp; The challenge facing these Natives is to hold onto the best their ancient heritage has to offer while at the same time learning to participate in and contribute to the dominant Western society.&nbsp; Not an easy task considering their culture is based on a subsistence community life, a stark contrast to modern Western ways.&nbsp; I like these people and their kind and gentle ways.&nbsp; It’s hard not to.&nbsp; They know and I know that we aren’t very different.&nbsp; I can’t help to think that a slight change in my heritage and it could be me in a nursing a Bud Light down in the slough.&nbsp; Ok, I’ll just step off my box now.&nbsp;   Earlier I mentioned the dog sled race trail that I ski on.&nbsp; This past weekend Fairbanks hosted the annual open sprint races.&nbsp; It’s a 3 day combined time race.&nbsp; The course is about 25 miles long and weaves through the city following the Chena and it’s maze of sloughs along the way.&nbsp; The races started each day right downtown on 2nd Avenue, just behind my office.&nbsp; Some of the sleds had 22 dogs out in front!&nbsp; Because it was an open race there was no limit to the size of the dog teams.&nbsp; It’s quite a site!   A few weeks back I was introduced to what it is like to soak in a hot tub, Alaskan style.&nbsp; Some friends have a homemade hot tub heated by a wood stove in the tub.&nbsp; It’s a clever snorkel type design.&nbsp; To believe it you have to see it.&nbsp; We got that thing fired up a few hours before we wanted to go in.&nbsp; When the temp reached 101 we hoped in.&nbsp; Every few minutes or so we had to get out and dump snow in to cool the water down.&nbsp; We gave up when the thermometer was topping 105!&nbsp; Temperature control in this tub is a rough science, but it sure is fun to be sitting out in the cold with a wood fired hot tub.   Kelly and I got our first brew on.&nbsp; Last Thursday we bottled our first batch of root beer.&nbsp; It has exceeded our expectations.&nbsp; Tonight we will brew ginger ale.&nbsp; Hopefully it will come out as good as the root beer.&nbsp; When we are confident with our procedures we’ll graduate to some other beers.&nbsp; Until then, we’ll work at quenching my sweet tooth.   Well, I better wrap this sucker up.&nbsp; Our moose are doing fine.&nbsp; The toboggan run is in good shape.&nbsp; We’re hanging in there.&nbsp; Things are peachy.&nbsp;   We think of you all often.&nbsp; God bless you and the Red Sox.&nbsp;   -zach and Kelly   5/16/04  Where to begin? Where to begin? I thought it was about time I jotted down some thoughts and checked in with you. The more time that goes by, the harder it is to write. As I experience life here in Fairbanks, I often make a mental note of events or things that I think would be good to include in my emails. When I wait so long, there is a bit of a back up and it is challenging to organize my thoughts in a suitable fashion. Here goes nothing...  One year ago, on May 1st, Kelly and I arrived in Fairbanks. It is hard to believe that it has been a full year. It has been quite an adventure and I hope that in some way you have felt like you were a part of it.  Since I last wrote, the snow has vanished from the yard, replaced by a beautiful green carpet of grass. It will need to be cut before the week is through. Pretty soon it will need to be cut a few times a week, thanks to the relentless sunlight it gets. You can just about hear the grass grow...nahhhh...but it does grow pretty fast.  Our root beer operation has ceased for the time being. The spring up the road where we get our brewing water has been temporarily closed because of some unfriendly bacteria levels. Seems that some nearby road construction coupled with a fast ice break-up has channeled some animal waste towards the spring. Now I don't feel so bad when some of our friends said that our root beer tasted like...  Just kidding. The water is tested very regularly and we are certain the only thing tainting our brews was my bad jokes as we bottled.  I'm sad to report that Kelly and I did not win the Nenana Ice-Classic. I wrote last year about the local lottery we bought a ticket for where each ticket purchased allowed you a guess as to the exact time the ice would go out on the Tanana River in Nenana. Well, we guessed April 26, at 5:26 pm. The ice went out the next day, early in the afternoon. The winners split a jackpot of over $300,000. Some years the ice hasn't gone out until the end of May!  I have officially completed my year of service as an AmeriCorps*VISTA. It has been an incredible learning experience for me. I have had the opportunity to meet, work with, and interview some unforgettable people and in the process learn much more about our great nation and myself. I can't say that there was ever a moment I regretted and I feel proud of the project I am leaving behind for the next VISTA to build upon. My transition to the paid working world has been fairly seamless. My agency has hired me temporarily. I have been supervising the technicians who were hired to work on the Veterans History Project with me. I will find out tomorrow if funding comes through to make my position permanent. I am looking forward to a real paycheck. We both are.  Kelly is doing quite well. She has had some ups and down with the Boys at the farm, but continues to find her work to be rewarding. She aced her class up at the University and is glad to have more free time now that it is through. Now that the weather is amicable, we have both been pounding the pavement and running quite a bit. We both ran a 5K last weekend and had a blast. There will be more races to come. After a long cold winter, we have a new appreciation for running.  Yesterday, we took the Boys to Denali National Park. The park is over 2 million square acres, but only has 1 road, and it dead-ends 120 miles or so into the park. It is impassable until the beginning of May. They allow vehicles to drive in 30 miles until June, when they only allow park busses on the road. We took advantage of a gorgeous day, packed up the van, and headed down the road. The entrance to the park is 120 miles or so south of Fairbanks. The ride itself is a bit of a safari. You never now what you may encounter. In the park we spotted moose (1 bull, 2 cows, and a calf), caribou (too many to count), dall sheep (too many to count), a porcupine, marmot-type critters, a fox, strange ground squirrels, an eagle, and a hawk. Despite our eagerness, we did not see any grizzlies or wolves. The boys saw both last time they were there with the other teaching parents. I've seen the pictures. The wolves came right up to the van...too cool. Maybe next time. We hiked around a bit. The park has very few trails. They encourage people to hike wherever they please, and to leave no trace behind. We had fun in some snowfields that remained on some slopes. All the while, Denali's 20,000+ ft. peak was looming large in the distance. What a place!  We are looking forward to a busy summer. Joy and Rachel will join us for a visit in June. At the end of June we are excited to travel to Judy and Richard's wedding in Maryland. In early July we my folks as well as our dear family friend, Ian will join us. C'mon up!  Much love,  Zach and Kelly   June 27, 2004  Summer is upon us. Jed put it best when on his visit last summer he cursed the midnight sun and said, "The sun is relentless!" What a glorious time, a crazy time! I started this email a couple weeks back but never got around to finishing it. All the while time marches on. We have had some fun this past month, some unique Alaskan experiences that you may find entertaining to read about, at least, this is my hope.  The frequencies of these emails have waned quite a bit in the past months. I feel I must offer an explanation. From the beginning these emails have been a great way for us to keep connected. More than once I have referred to them as my therapy. As we have settled into the new chapter of our life here in Fairbanks, it has been a great comfort to share some of our adventures with you, our loved ones. It has been cathartic and I must confess a mostly selfish exercise. I have especially appreciated the responses and rounds of discourse that follows an email. Lately I have been feeling a bit guilty about this. More than once when I have sat down to write I have been cut short by the voices in my head that say, "Ok, Zach, I think they get it. You are in Alaska. Big freekin’ deal. Get on with your life." Well, I have thought a lot about this and I’m certain the conflict inside of me exists and will continue to exist because I desire to get on with my life, but to do so while sharing it with you. And so here I am writing again to say, "Hey. I hope all is well in your neck of the woods." Please accept my ramblings not as bravado detailing how much better life is on the other side of the fence, but rather as a sincere and humble attempt to keep you informed as to joys and trials of our life in the Last Frontier.  Today, I am writing from the East Coast. We are at Joy and Rachel’s place in Virginia. We are here briefly for Kelly’s Dad’s wedding. Richard and Judy have planned a weekend wedding in Maryland on the Chesapeake. We are looking forward to a great time. Tomorrow morning we are going to check out the new WWII memorial before we head to the beach.  I have the house to myself, well, mostly to myself. Mr. Big, the cat, is hovering over the keyboard as I type away. Shay does this back home. What is it with pets that they put themselves right in the middle of what you are trying to do? I swear Mr. Big’s "meow" is really his attempt to say, "Me now!" Anyway, despite my feline friend sprawling across my hands making typing a bit of a challenge, it’s a great opportunity to reflect on the past weeks.  Rachel and Joy were up last week for a visit. They flew into Anchorage and we drove the 360 miles south to meet them. We wanted them to see this part of AK before heading north to the Interior and Fairbanks. From Anchorage we made a day trip south to Whittier. Whittier is a small fishing village on Prince William Sound only accessible by ferry or a 1 lane, 2 mile tunnel carved beneath the Chugach mountains. We took the tunnel. It was raining and we decided that we weren’t up for getting soaked on a glacial cruise. Instead we grabbed a quick lunch and headed back out via the tunnel. The whole area is glaciated and we stopped off at Portage glacier on the way back to Anchorage. We had a crystal clear day for our drive back to Fairbanks. Denali and Foraker were out in all their glory. These peaks never cease to take my breath away. I’m glad Rachel and Joy got to see them when they were out of the clouds. We stopped and did a small hike in Denali National Park before driving the last couple hours back to Fairbanks. They left last Thursday and we are reunited again today.  This past weekend we joined thousands of other Fairbankskans in celebrating the Summer Solstice. Each year folks get excited about the festivities around town, but nothing generates as much excitement as the annual Summer Solstice 10K Fun Run. On Saturday night Kelly joined over 4,000 runners and lined up at the University for the start. Among the crowd were hundreds who sported their latest costumes. There are great prizes for those who are the most creative, but they have to complete the race in costume. We saw folks dressed up as the Flinstones (with foot powered car), the Northern Lights, a Phoenix, and the Osbornes. There were men in diapers, plenty of men in drag, some of AK’s finest (sarcasm) women with way too little clothing, and many other sights. When the gun went off at 10pm, the sun was still blazing. The racecourse winds its way through some of Fairbanks’ oldest neighborhoods. Folks line along the route have barbecues and set up their sprinklers. Runners are offered anything from beer to BBQ to ice cream along the way. Kelly said that there were a lot of sprinklers to run through. Each year, this year included, some cruel folks set up an elaborate finish line a half-mile before the real finish. I was waiting at the real finish. It was a wonderful festivity. I watched as folks of all ages, shapes, and appearances triumphantly crossed the finish line. I think for many, it was a celebration of making it through another cold Alaskan winter. I will never forget the crowd cheering on Mr. Hackney, an 85 year old WWII veteran I met, crossing the finish line. His smile was priceless. I wish him many more happy finishes. It was a night to remember. Kelly said it was the most fun she has had in Fairbanks. However, we both agree the most fun we have has since being in AK was our trip to Chitina.  A few weekends back Kelly and I loaded up the Subaru and headed out for Chitina, a small village about 300 miles southeast of Fairbanks, towards Valdez. Kelly didn’t get off work until 11pm Friday night and by the time we packed the car it was a bit after midnight. It made no difference when we left, it was going to be light and we were on a mission. We were on our way to get some fish, namely red salmon. We left our fishing rods behind. No fooling around for us, only dipnets would do!  We drove a couple hours south and pulled off in Delta Junction for some sleep. We drove right out onto the Delta. I was half expecting to wake with a wild bison licking our windshield. There is a heard that can frequently be seen there. No such encounter happened. After a few hours of sleep we were on the road again. Along the way we encountered some moose, but more exciting to us were the three baby caribou that were wondering in the middle of the road, just north of Paxson. They were cute little suckers! Further south the drive took us parallel to Mt. Wrengal St. Elias National Park. This is the park I wrote earlier about, the one with a glacier lager than Rhode Island! It’s a beautiful place, one I hope we can spend more time in soon. Anyway, we arrived in Chitina early Saturday afternoon. After scoping the scene out we were ready to catch some fish!  The AK Department of Fish and Game supervises the fishery in Chitina. The fishery is unique in that it is a 5 mile stretch of the Copper River that is set aside specifically for AK residents to dipnet, no out-of-staters and no fishing poles allowed. The Copper River is considered to be the siltiest river in AK, an ideal river for salmon. At the fishery, the Copper river narrows from a very wide, braided river into a roaring, turbulent and narrow canyon. The canyon is an ideal place to dipnet because all the fish are channeled through this spot. It is also a very dangerous place. I had never experienced a river like this before. Most people climb down the steep banks and tie themselves before they get their nets wet. Some hang off the sides of the rocks. It wouldn’t be pretty if you were to fall in. We took the safe route and shelled out some money to be dropped off by boat at a safe spot. We spent the night on the river and when we were picked up in the morning we had 21 beautiful red salmon to haul back.  Unlike fly fishing, there really isn’t much skill to dipnetting. In fact, 5 minutes after we were dropped off, we had our nets in the water. Not 5 minutes later, Kelly was yelping, she had a big ol’ salmon in her net. She dragged it to shore where I was waiting with an aluminum bat. A couple whacks over the head ended the jerks of the fish. It sounds cruel, but it the was the quickest way to end the fish’s life. We fished on and off through the night. Probably a total of 8 hours. In that time we caught 21 good size salmon. After cleaning the fish we headed out for the trek home. When we were back in Fairbanks Georgean helped us prepare the fish for the freezer. It was wonderful experience. Its hard to describe the thrill of feeling the salmon swim into your net. I even caught 2 at once! It was amazing.  Well, this is way too long. Love to you. God bless!  -zach and Kelly  "Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius.&nbsp; Love, love, love, that is the sole of genius."&nbsp;&nbsp; - W.A.&nbsp;Mozart&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;
