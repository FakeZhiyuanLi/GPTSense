      So I'm still crazy busy trying to get everything at work ready for my vacation next week, but I decided instead to write a blog entry. If you would call me a procrastinator, you would be right.   At times I've felt that my procrastination has helped me, especially when it comes to work-related things.  I guess I just like the adrenaline rush.  Am I going to make it in time?  Especially as Editor of my college newspaper, Monday mornings were crazy.  I never knew from week to week if we'd make our deadline to the printer or not, and we usually cut it pretty close.  I usually missed my noon Anthropology class because I was driving to Batavia to drop off the files for our paper to get printed at the Clermont Sun (this was before the days of FTP-ing, which is what they do now... lucky bastards).  Anyway, because I missed at least 1/3 of my anthropology classes, I ended up getting a C in that course.  I usually tell people that it was the only C I ever got in college, but to confess, I also got a C in Journalism Ethics.  The anthropology C doesn't reflect badly on me, but the Journalism Ethics grade kind of looks bad I think.  In my defense, it wasn't that I wasn't journalistically ethical per se, it was more that I really didn't try too hard in that class. The advisor to the newspaper was the professor, and I thought of it as sort of a "free ride" class.  Unfortunately, the professor didn't see it that way... he was actually going to grade me based on my performance in class.  How rude.    Since I've been out of college (and grad school), I have had a lot of the typical "forgot my homework" dreams.  I also have a recurring dream where I somehow forgot to show up for class all semester, and didn't know what to do.  I also tend to have a lot of dreams about bugs.  They are usually attacking me in some way, and usually involves me trying to squish them.  I think I need some sort of dream analysis, because it's obvious that at a subconscious level, I am seriously disturbed.  I really should get back to work now... hey, it's almost lunchtime.  I'm thinking I'll go to Arby's today.  Everytime I go there it reminds me of the time my brother Nick spilled the Au-jou sauce for his French dip all over his car.  His car smelled like Arby's for two years.  I really should get back to work now... really.  Until next time, Gabrielle

      I'm scrambling around attempting to get everything at work all set before I leave for vacation next week.  It's alarming to me that no one seems to realize the implications of my taking a vacation.  Ummm, what are you people going to do?  Anyone?  Bueller?  Taking a week's vacation shouldn't be this difficult.  Really. I luckily have one co-worker who I feel confident will keep things running smoothly while I'm gone, but, sheesh, what if he gets sick or something?  Anyone think of that?  So alas, I am trrying to to get most everything possible done, so that I can spend next week in relative peace.   I haven't planned anything for next week... my boyfriend may or may not be out of town for work, so if he's home maybe we'll go camping for a few days, and if he's not, I was planning on sitting at my pool and drinking some beers all week.  I got it in my head today though that I might find a last-minute cruise deal and take my mom someplace tropical.  I don't care where, just someplace with palm trees, sunshine, a beach and pina coladas, lots of pina coladas.  Just keep the pina coladas coming, sir.  Well, that's all for now.  Short post, I know, but I'm not feeling particularly creative today.  Until next time, Gabrielle

      It looks like I might have to take off weekends for blogging.  I wanted to do some entries over the weekend but I just had too much going on. I spent Saturday playing flag football, drinking beer and playing cornhole at the pool, then attending a Reds game.  Due to the fact that I drank all day and didn't wear any sunblock, I've earned the dubious distinction from my boyfriend Jason as "treating my body like a rental car."  In my estimation, I have at least another 10 years before the skin cancer and liver disease set in, and by then science will have discovered much better treatments for those things, so I'm not worried.  Treating my body like a rental car is a good segue into today's post.  One Thursday night last August, I was excited about my friend Chuck coming into town from Boston to meet up with me to attend our good friend Kevin's wedding in the Dominican Republic (he was marrying Shel, the same Shel from my first post). Chuck arrived at about 8 p.m. at my place.  We were to leave at 4 a.m. to catch the chartered plane at 5:30 a.m. with Kevin, Shel and their families and other friends.  About 9 p.m., we decided to head out to York St., one of our old favorite hangouts from when Chuck lived in Cincinnati.  We ran into our friend Aaron down there, and had just learned that another friend, Justin, had beome a manager at York St., so he was tending bar that night.  Two bands were playing that night, Chasing Zen and Chaselounge.  We missed Chasing Zen's set, but were really digging Chaselounge.  It was nice night for having some drinks (Justin made some sort of specialty drink that was quite tasty), catching up with Chuck and Aaron, and listening to some good local music.    Knowing I was single and knowing my type of guy, I pointed out someone to Chuck across the room who caught my eye, and also happened to be the bass player from Chasing Zen. (Bass players had been my "thing" for a while.) At around 12 a.m, it came to my attention that we should be leaving soon, seeing as we would have leave in a few hours to catch our plane.  But that's also about the time that I met Scott (the aforementioned bass player).  We started talking, and he seemed too good to be true.  We had a lot in common. He also had a master's degree in public administration, was a pretty good swing dancer, was in a fraternity in college... generally speaking, he seeemed like the perfect guy.  I was reeling with excitement, but nature called.  I walked downstairs to the restaurant area to pee (the bathroom in the bar area is unisex, which has always creeped me out), and that's when it happened.  On the bottom step, I lost my footing and fell to the floor.  When I stood up, I noticed my left ankle hurt like hell.  I thought I could shake it off.  After using the bathroom, I went back upstairs and pretended nothing was wrong, although my ankle was really, really hurting now and I couldn't apply too much pressure on it, so I had to limp a bit.  After Chuck and Scott inquired as to why I was limping, they took a look at the ankle--as did the crowd that seemed to form around me.  Chuck did what any non-medically trained 30-something single guy would do in that situation... made sure I got completely wasted (as did my new friend Scott and several other random people).  Chuck got drunk too; I think it was sort of a sympathy drunk or something.    When we showed up at the airport reeking of bourbon and me limping, Kevin and Shel knew it would be a long trip.  The plane flight down to the Dominican Republic was quite possibly the worst experience of my life.  Not only did my ankle blow up to twice the size of my other ankle, it turned an appalling shade of black and blue.  About a half hour after we took off was when the nausea set in.  Now, I normally get motion sickness on planes anyway, but this was definitely hangover nausea coupled with the motion sickness, coupled with the fact that I was in so much pain it was unbearable.  Many of my fellow travelers--those with the wedding party as well as complete strangers--felt it necessary to become my personal pharmacist, offering me pretty much every over-the-counter medication known to man.  I took a few of their offerings--nothing worked.  We got to the Dominican Republic finally after what seemed like my whole life on that airplane, we got to the hotel, and as I had become pretty adept at limping by that point, I was able to enjoy the three days there.  I was up and around and salsa dancing by the last night we were there... until I fell again on some wet tile shortly after we got back to the hotel.    Addendums: I never saw Scott again, not sure why.  My left ankle is still a tad bit fatter than the right one, although it's healed.  It was a beautiful wedding, and despite the fact that we almost didn't make it, I'm certainly glad I was able to hobble down there to attend.   Until next time, Gabrielle

      So I'm feeling very calm and peaceful on this Friday morning.  Got into work, no fires to put out, everyone's internet and email are working fine, not much in my inboxes (yes, there are several), and my boss ("the prez") is to be out for most of the day.  The prez has indicated yesterday that I might get a raise next month, which is fantastic--not because I need the money, but it's the principle that I know I'm worth it.  Not only did I take over like 10 new responsibilities, but I just saved the company about $700/month on cell phones and about $300/month on uneccessary banking charges...and I think I deserve a little extra for that. *snaps finger and shakes head like black chick on Jenny Jones*    Right now I'm sipping my coffee and thinking about surfing the net a little to see if I can find a cheap trip to Belize in November.  I would like to make it my goal to try to take a trip out of the country at least once a year.  I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to do it this year, since I just bought a new laptop and a sectional sofa. (Which were very sensible purchases, seeing as I spend most of my free time on the sofa--which is wicked comfy--whilst pinging away at my laptop.)  Although technically, yes, I can afford all those things plus a trip to Belize, I'm trying to be more financially responsible as I get older.  I always wondered how my parents, with their huge bank account, could stand there in Kroger and haggle over whether the corn in the husk or the corn that was pre-shucked in the plastic package was cheaper per cob.  I mean, I figure they have well over a million dollars in cash and assets, and they are arguing over 20-some cents?  But the lesson that I've learned is that situations like that are how they got to where they are today.  So, taking their cue, the first things I bought when I moved into my expensive luxury apartment last year was a case of Ramen noodles.   But alas, Belize calls to me. Last year I went to the Dominican Republic for my out-of-country trip.  And what a trip it was.  That's a good story for my next post.    Before I sign off though, an addendum to the Chipotle addiction post from yesterday.  I almost had to lie to my brother Nick last night.  After work, I purchased the burritos for me and Nick to enjoy, for he was to come over to my apartment for lunch (I always find it funny that he calls it lunch, since he works second shift and his lunch occurs at like 6 p.m.).  Anyway, in the meantime, Jason left me a voice mail telling me HE was coming over around 6.  So I had a conundrum--only 1 extra burrito and two burrito-loving guests.  However, I wasn't sure if Jason necesarilly wanted the specific burrito that was hand-crafted for Nick, so he needed to be asked. I considered my options.  I decided that if Jason called first and laid claim to the burrito, that I would call Nick and tell him that Chipotle burned down so I didn't have a burrito for him.  However, Nick called first, and I think he smelled burrito through the phone wire, and I confessed that his burrito was there awaiting his arrival.  Jason called a few minutes later, and I told him that he would have to provide his own meal, since I was to be dining on Chipotle with Nick.  He said it was no problem, that he was going to get take-out from the chinese restaurant next to the gas station and bring that over, but he wasn't going to be there until after 7 p.m. due to a fuel shortage in his gas tank that left him temporarily stranded in his driveway. Nick came over at 6, we enjoyed our burritos and he went back to work, and Jason came over at 7 and I drank a beer while he ate his General Tso's chicken and an eggroll.  So, despite my panic, the situation was resolved without incident...might I say, peacefully.  Until tomorrow, Gabrielle

      Today's post is dedicated to Chipotle, the restaurant that serves burrritos made with crack in them. They must have crack (or some other addictive carcinogen) in them because they are so freakin' good.  So freakin' good in fact that at lunch yesterday I stood in line for a goddamn half hour with 30-40 other burrito lovers just to receive my delicious treat.  I'm serious, the line was well out the door, and this is apparently a common occurence--it wasn't like National Burrito Day or anything. A lot of people, LOVE--and I mean really, really LOVE--Chipotle, hence my theory that their burritos contains some kind of addictive substance which causes the constant Chipotle craving.  Oh!  It's getting to me right now, I'm having withdrawal symptoms; I'm starting to shake and twitch... Need......meat...wrapped...in...warm...soft...tortilla...now.  Anyway, I think the best thing about Chipotle is its simplicity.  I mean they really only sell one item, but they make it however you want it.  I personally like mine with light rice, chicken, black beans, a little sour cream, corn salsa and cheese.  Sometimes I like to change it up a bit by adding guacamole or subbing the chicken for steak.  It's all good at Chipotle; I bet if you brought in your own ingredients--say mushrooms or roadkill or shards of broken glass or whatever--they'd wrap that shit into a burrito for you.   Did you know that they are owned by McDonald's?  How insane is that? It must have just come to some crazy-ass McDonald's VP one day, like, "Hey, you know how we sell these cheap crappy hamburgers?  Maybe we should add a line of restaurants that sells $6 burritos."  I mean, where's the logical leap there?  I just can't find it.  All I know is, I love those damn burritos.  Mmmmm.  Until later, Gabrielle

      One of the more annoying parts of my job, as many technicians in IT and similar fields will agree, is the daily problem of having a user who has a problem and wants it fixed, but has absolutely no details in order for you to troubleshoot the problem.  Basically, it's broken and I need you to fix it.  Ummm, how is it broken?  What's broken about it?  When did it stop working?  What the hell did you do to break it?  DETAILS, I NEED DETAILS!  Really, the common "user" just doesn't understand that "it's broken--fix it" isn't nearly enough to start troubleshooting.  Plus, sometimes I'm on the flipside, as I was this morning, having to find enough details about the particular problem for my outsource tech (the geek guru who I go to when it's REALLY fucked up) so that I didn't have to call him and say, "It's broken, I couldn't fix it. You try."  So, that's been a big part of my morning, and I think I'm going to need to take a long lunch and a handful of valium to get through the afternoon.    Another thing that seriously irks me is when something isn't working correctly company-wide (i.e. email, the internet, the server files, etc.), everyone wants to tell you what's not working, even though it is clearly obvious that I already know.  I'm sitting at the server, on the phone with tech support and you're telling me your email isn't working.  Ummm, yeah.     Okay, so I like to bitch about the little things at work that bother me--who doesn't?  I think it's a universal thing.  I bet there are some workers in Mongolia right now bitching about their 15-hour/day sweatshop job and how Habib does shit and gets 40 cents per day, when they are only getting 25 cents per day.  Anyway, the point is, I guess it could be worse.  That's all for now, gotta get to lunch--I think I'll have Chipotle, which will be the topic of my next post. Until then, Gabrielle

      As promised during yesterday's post, today's post is dedicated to the love of my life, the wondiferous Jason.    Jason and I met online last year, I was seeing someone else at the time who was fantastickly wonderful himself, but just wasn't making the kind of time it takes for a relationship, so I started poking around to see what was out there.  When I found Jason online, I fell crazy in love with him, and we've been together ever since. After all the bad relationships he's been in, he calls it "Girlfriend Karma" to have found me.  He also says I'm the coolest girlfriend ever, which I must say, is true, but I might be biased.  One of my favorite things about Jason is his fishing hat which he sometimes wears with his "Happy Camper" t-shirt.  An outdoorsy kind of guy, he works for an EPA contractor and spends his summers wading through streams and swamps collecting samples of god-knows-what, and then he spends the winter picking at the creepy, crawly things they collected.  I don't know much about science, but apparently somehow his job eventually ends up improving water quality.  Actually, though, sometimes I wonder if really works for the CIA and this whole EPA thing is just a cover-up.  Hmmm.  Well, I guess that's all about Jason for now, I'm sure he will come into play in later posts. But, it's quittin' time, so I am signing off for now, Gabrielle

      So here goes.  Like many other things in my life, I have taken the cue to start a blog from my friend, Shel, who tends to have great ideas five minutes before I steal them and then claim them as my own.  Just like the blogging thing, I started my own company a few months after Shel did.  Although I have yet to have a paying client, I am keeping busy.  One of my current non-paying clients has inspired me to learn Flash, so that I can use it on her website.  I also figure it's a good idea, since I've had Flash on my resume for years without ever having used it.  I figured it wouldn't be too hard to learn given my graphic design background, and alas, it wasn't.   Unlike my pal Shel, I did not have the luxury of quitting my current job for my budding new business, so I still juggle them both.  I work for a Japanese company, which keeps me crazy and sane at the same time.  Crazy because Japanese people are crazy, our company is crazy, and my job is crazy.  I am currently in charge of marketing, IT, office managment, sales support and accounting.  Yeah.  Not too easy, but it keeps me sane because they pay me so well (like, um, double what I was making at my last job) and they generally leave me alone as long as I am keeping things running smoothly.    It wasn't always that way though.  I am coming up on two years with my company, and it reminds me how *completely* freaked out I was when I first started.  Different people (all men), different culture (mostly Japanese) and entirely different field than I had ever even imagined.  For the first two weeks, I was completely in the dark as to what the company even did, or made, or sold... But, as the weeks, months, and now years, have gone on, I've learned way more than any woman should know about stamping press equipment.    My personal business, with it's ultra-creative title, Gabrielle Dion Communications, is starting to actually pick up pretty quickly.  I think one day I may be able to run GDC as a sole, or at least primary, source of income.    Well, that's enough about me for right now.  Next time I will write about the wonderfullness that is the love of my life, Jason.  Until then, Gabrielle

      As I mentioned in the last post, Jason is definitely one of the best things to happen to me in my life.&nbsp; I was thinking on the drive home from his house last week about why that is.&nbsp; It got me to thinking about past relationships, etc. and I decided it's about time I properly chronicled the significant boys who've come and gone over the years.  &nbsp;  The Ed Years  My first boyfriend was an incredibly smart, witty, kinda nerdy&nbsp;guy who I had been attending school with since freshman year, but didn't notice until junior year of high school when we were paired up to share a copy of The Crucible which we were reading aloud in Mr. Sinninger's Honors English class.&nbsp; It was also about that time that we realized our lockers were right next to each other.&nbsp; Crushes are always so sweet at that age.&nbsp; I would look forward to seeing him every morning at the lockers and later&nbsp;during English class.&nbsp; I was confused when he didn't ask me to the Christmas Formal, but to my delight he called to ask me out on a date the following week.&nbsp; We were virtually inseparable for the next month and a half.&nbsp; Ed weirded out after a trip to Virginia for a funeral and broke up with me.&nbsp; I think he was dealing with some pretty heavy emotional problems, having to do with his family, with being&nbsp;in his first "real" relationship with me, with a lot of things that he was trying to run away from... He later&nbsp;started dating my best friend Veronica, who turned out to be a lesbian who was dating him as a cover for her relationship with a girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;Veronica and I are still good friends to this day, but somewhere along the way, we both lost Ed, and often wonder where he is and whatever happened to him.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Mad Max  The next significant relationship was with Max.&nbsp; I was never really physically attracted to him, but he was so intellegent and so funny, that he made for great company.&nbsp; My parents and friends felt that we were definitely not a good match, and I spent a lot of time defending him.&nbsp; Once I started getting more involved in college, sorority and other boys, I&nbsp;dumped him.&nbsp; I wish that&nbsp;I had handled things better in the way that I broke off our relationship, and later our friendship, but I was in college&nbsp;and&nbsp;extremely immature.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The X Men  Many of the most significant guys in my life attended all-boys catholic high schools (St. X or Covington Latin).&nbsp; I met Matt Brokaw through a friend of mine from high school who he was dating at Miami University.&nbsp; I adored Matt Brokaw, but his two best friends from St. X high school, Otto Baum and Matt Behrman, made an immediate impression on me because of their crazy antics.&nbsp; I&nbsp;had&nbsp;such a great time hanging out with those guys; they always kept me laughing.&nbsp; After Matt and Alisa had broken up, Otto called me one night to tell me that I was "voted into the group" and that I should come over, and I spent the next few years as one of the guys, as well as occasional potential love interest to Otto &amp; the Matts. The best times were the unplanned--&nbsp;a pillow fight in Matt's basement, driving with Otto to Burger King at midnight on Friday during Lent to&nbsp;consume meat without sin, almost puking in Matt's mom's Lexus during a particularly nasty hangover, and Otto teaching me to drive a stick shift in the parking lot at Sam's Club.&nbsp; Those were some really good times, and really great guys to spend them with.  &nbsp;  Boy Wonders  On my first day at NKU, I spotted a really tall, scary guy with long hair and a goatee, who was in my speech class.&nbsp; He was intriguing, but seeing as I had never seen someone that "urban" looking, he was mostly just scary.&nbsp; We ended up having to choose a partner, learn as much as possible about that person, and then give a speech on them during the next class session.&nbsp; And that's how I met Chuck, who is still one of my closest friends, and who introduced me to several other important guys who are still in my life and who also happened to be Covington Latin graduates... most notably, Kevin, Travis, Jim, and Mike.&nbsp; The greatest quality of Covington Latin boys (and similarly St. X boys) is their ability to make you feel like the most important, beautiful, intellegent women they ever met, even with their girlfriend or wife sitting right there next to them.&nbsp; I don't know if it's something that they teach in all-boys catholic school, or some product of that environment, but whatever it is, I've always felt it with my St. X and Covington Latin boys, and it's why they are so important to me today--they taught me how I should be treated.&nbsp;  **Cute sidenote: Chuck and Otto are cousins, which I didn't find out until long after I knew both of them.  &nbsp;  Bad Jeff/Good Jeff  In stark contrast to my X and Cov Latin boys was "Bad Jeff."&nbsp; Strangely enough, Chuck set me up with Jeff, which he regrets to this day and swears never to set me up with anyone again.&nbsp; I was at such a rough time in my life when I was dating Jeff and he was completely not supportive.&nbsp; He tore down my confidence in myself, cheated on me, and then led me on for several months after breaking up with me.&nbsp; I think he actually enjoyed seeing my anguish.&nbsp;It took me at least two years before I was fully over the pain that I incurred during that time in my life.&nbsp; Good Jeff, on the other hand, was someone I dated both before and a few times after Bad Jeff, and he was such a super guy, but just needed a little growing up to do.&nbsp; I like to think of my Jason as the evolved, mature version of Good Jeff.&nbsp; They actually look&nbsp;a lot a like too.  &nbsp;  Saunders  Chris Saunders was president of&nbsp;NKU's Student Goverment&nbsp;Association at the&nbsp;same time that I was&nbsp;Editor-in-Cheif of the school newspaper (in other words,&nbsp;bitter rivals).&nbsp; We formed a pretty strong friendship the previous year and throughout the summer, so we&nbsp;had no idea what we were in for once school started that semester.&nbsp; We both took a lot of risks for one another that year, and always looked out for each other even when it reflected poorly upon ourselves.&nbsp; When I look back on the decisions I made that year, no matter what others thought of them at the time, I'm glad that I chose the road that kept Chris as a friend, because he has since seen me through some hard times and is someone I can still count on to this day.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Jason  Not much to say here that hasn't already been said, except that as a St. X boy, he definitely embodies my favorite characteristics of the St. X prototype... but much more than that.&nbsp; I don't think words can describe it even.  &nbsp;  I've learned important lessons from each of these boys in my life.&nbsp; I've learned how to be treated with respect and chivalry, how to not put up with being treated with disrespect, how to fall in and out of love, how to flirt and get the attention I deserve,&nbsp;how to break a heart and mend a broken one, how to&nbsp;be the kind of woman&nbsp;a man desires,&nbsp;and above all else, I've learned what makes a boy a man.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Alice from my apartment complex is *the* social director... having lived at the complex a few years and basically knowing everyone, she decided to jazz things up in our community (which is mostly young professionals) by having a progressive drinking party.  Calling it Nine Holes of Drinking, Alice threw *the* party of the summer. Nine residents were to share their apartment and a specialty alcoholic beverage for about a half hour before moving on to the next hole. Among those I most clearly remember were yeager bombs, margaritas and our "Par 5" drink--Brian and JB's vodka tonics served in pint glasses. I hosted hole #7, and not knowing how many people to expect, I made two pitchers of my drink (white russians) in advance, but needed to whip up two more batches during my hole, because we had picked up a ton of people along the way. After Nine Holes was over, few were clear on what they did next that night.  I heard there was a party at the Germans' apartment, which I believe my brother Nick attended before passing out in the parking lot.    Anyway, it was such a hit that several residents had wanted to do it again.  Not having the time to plan it again this year, Alice elected me as vice social director, and I had a great Nine Holes in June.  Of course, I made postcards for the event for each apartment building, specialty flags for each hole, a scorecard complete with golf pencils and a gift for each host.  I can't help it, I'm in marketing!  It's what I do for a living!  So, I've already been asked to plan "The Back Nine" for August.  Should be another good time, assuming that no one ends up in the hospital or in jail.  I've got to get some sleep now.  I've been over at Jason's helping him pack for his trip tomorrow (work stuff involving fish).  I was thinking on the way home how he really is the best boyfriend ever, but more than that, he is definitely one of few men in my life who have truly treated me exceptionally well.  More on that topic in my next post.  Until then, Gabrielle

      As I mentioned in the last post, yesterday was the championships for our co-ed flag football team.  Flag football has become somewhat of a new passion for me. I love the rule that every third play must involve a female, and 5 men and 3 women are on each team. My brother Nick and I played in this league (sponsored by Cincinnati Sports Leagues) about 10 years ago with a team formed by a friend of ours that worked for Fifth Third Bank.  It was pretty fun then, and we've been talking about putting together a team for years now.  So I finally got motivated to do it, and I assembled a team through the apartment complex I live in, Wright's Point, and we thus became the Wright's Wraiders (a name for which I take credit and blame).    The Wraiders had a so-so season, but did well in the playoffs by defeating the team No Talent Ass Clowns and then having the fortunate incident of a forfeit by our second-round team, taking us to the finals and earning us an extra beer ticket (the winning team of each game gets a ticket for a free pitcher of beer at the sponsor bar, MLT'S).  In yesterday's finals, we easily beat R.P. McMurphy's at 10 a.m. led by our "ringer" quarterback, Ali.  Ali plays in the competitive division, but we were able to draft him for our rec division team, so when he doesn't have a game at the same time as us, he plays QB for us. We've never won a game without him.  Our 11 a.m. game--the chapionship finals--was to be against team Got the "W" and we were without Ali as his finals were at the same time.  We got spanked royally by Got the "W" and we came out of the game with the "L" and our heads hung low.  Really, though, for an expansion team to make it to the final game is kind of a big deal, so I'm quite proud.  I'm putting together another team for the fall season and look forward to many victories and beer tickets.  I'm going to see if I can draft a good quarterback for the fall (Ali's wife just had twins last week, so he will not be playing football for awhile).  I'm also going to come up with a better color for our team jerseys, as black was definitely not comfortable in 80+ degree heat.  Go Wraiders!  In the meantime, as vice social director of Wright's Point, my next project will be "The Back Nine," an end-of-summer party to complement the summer's kickoff party, "Nine Holes of Drinking," which will be the topic of my next post.  Until later, Gabrielle

      So I haven't posted in a while because I just returned home last night from my vacation to Montreal.  Montreal is a beautiful, very metropolitan city, a bit reminiscent of Paris in its architecture, but not much else.  The people there are all bilingual, and they recognize right away when you are trying to speak French to them that you are an American and they generally give you a little smile and then proceed into speaking English.  I generally can only say a few basic things in French anyway, so it was very nice for the Montrealites to be so accommodating.  Although my trip cohort (my father) is fluent in French, they still were able to detect that it was not his native language, and proceeded to give him the same knowing smile and then switch to English.  The trip was fun, we had great weather and my dad did not have any anxiety attacks (which is rare) nor did he embarrass me publicly by singing, dancing or loudly spouting his politcal views.  He also bought me a nice pair of addidas sneakers since we were doing a lot of walking and all I brought were uncomfortable but way-cute "girl" shoes (which is typical of me).  We spent some time walking through Old Town, which is quite beautiful and reminds me a bit of the Mayfair district in London.  Lots of little shops and sidewalk cafes, along with some street performers and a mime who gives out free hugs.  Later we found the International Jazz Festival which was going on in the center of town. We spent a lot of time there, since I am crazy about seeing live jazz.  As for local fare, I drank plenty of Labatt's and Molson's beer and had a crepe which was not half bad, and then there was the fries with gravy.  My brother Nick, while on business in Toronto, also experienced this unusual dish, and explained this Canadian phenomenon to me.  They seriously put gravy on their french fries.  And I'm not talking like a little dipping cup on the side, either--the gravy engulfs the fries entirely.  It wasn't technically "bad" per se, but if I'm going to put anything else except ketchup on my fries, I think I'd prefer mayonnaise or ranch dressing to gravy.  So, that's about it for now; tomorrow is the big co-ed flag football tournament, so I should probably rest up, study the play book, look at last week's films, etc. Actually, I think I'll just go out and get piss drunk instead, since you shouldn't change what's working for you.  Cheers! Gabrielle

      At about 2:00 this afternoon, I acheived an absolute state of zen.  The reason for this was that I fixed my wireless network, which had been causing me such stress last week that it was actually beginning to effect my mental and physical health.  I was staying up all night, coming home for lunch, basically spending all of my free time consumed with fixing this network.  And, alas, it is done.  Jason and I ate lunch today at Scalea's, a delicious gourmet deli in Covington, and while eating we were discussing some of his issues at work.  After listening to his problems, I told him that I felt he was over-analyzing the situation, and causing his situation to make him stress out even while away from the "office" (seeing as his office this summer consists of a boat, it's funny to call it that).  I told him not to worry, that it'll all work out. I erred in trying to use myself as an example of someone who adheres to the worry-free philosophy.  He mention the wireless network situation mentioned above, and it was at that point I realized I was being hypocritical.    However, I have long been on a mission to become less of a worry-wart.  I stressed myself out so bad in my junior year of high school that I got a bleeding ulcer.  At 16!  Since then, I've definitely spent a lot of time stressing over things, but luckily I haven't gotten the ulcers again.  I try to stay focused of the reality that worrying isn't going to change your situation, so why bother?  I love the Jason Mraz song, "I Won't Worry My Life Away."  It speaks to me... I think so many people spend so much time fretting over things that they can't change overnight anyway-- weight, jobs, money, what others think of them, etc.  Not to say that one should live like some sort of primitive bohemian, but I've never been so happy since I've stopped worrying so much.  The extra pounds will come off in time, as long as I stay active and try to eat right, jobs and money and significant others "happen" for the most part--you can't really make your situation in those areas, you just have to do what feels right and hope for the best, and what other people think of you doesn't matter nearly as much as what you think of yourself.  So, once I came to these conclusions, I really started to worry much less.  The wireless network thing really still ate at me though... but I'm still young so there's plenty of time to get my philosophy down pat.  Once I do, that will really be zen, I think.  Until next time, Gabrielle
