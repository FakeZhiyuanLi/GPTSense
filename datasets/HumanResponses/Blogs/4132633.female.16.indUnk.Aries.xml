						   Quite a lot of things happen lately.. some happy.. some sad.. but i tink overall.. it's sad... my best frend finally got herself someone who can realli take care of her... I'm happie 4 her too.. but i tink she has done things overboard...  Maybe is i'm being possessive? selfish? petty? i'm not so sure.. but i noe tat she couldn't find e balance between frends and her bf.. if tat's so.. i pity her.. she jux brush her frend aside when her man appear.. mentally... e man stick to her 24hrs everyday.. if she wants to tok, she'll tok abt her new relationship.. I'm realli gettin sick of tat.. tired of tat.. she have changed.. getting more spoilt.. tot everything she do is gonna be rite.. and nvr let ppl comment.. erm.. maybe she did but she reject negative comments u see... b4 she got her man.. i'm v close wit her.. she oso rather sensitive to my feelings.. but now.. she wil nvr do tat again.. she's probably too involved in e relationship.. i dun realli blame her.. as i tink she dun noe tat she's tat bad rite now.. i hope she'll spare a tot to frends ard her.. wish her gd luck..  today.. i need someone to tok to and share my woes.. but in fact.. i'm alone.. i'm disappointed.. dar is busy... real busy.. especially when i need him.. frend? busy wit her man.. wat shld i do? i feel like dyin.. dyin in a pool of loneliness.. i'm so sick.. i need e someone.. suddenly realised life is realli FULL of ups and downs.. y mux we need to conquer every one of them? why can't they jux solved by themselves?  maybe i'm stressed now.. a major exam is cumin up.. i'm not used to study everyday but now i'm forced to by my future.. i've been cryin for a few days now.. i juz can't solve my daily problems.. they juz existed.. create troubles after troubles... sadness after sadness... wat will i be when i'm writin a new entry again? i dunno... hopefully i'm still alive....
