      Applied for www.2nje.com today. The name selection process has been going on for 3 days now. www.2nje.com had some fierce competition there for a while, but this name is short and easy so I went with it. Hope I don't change my mind in the near future...  The background for 2nje is the simple fact that my name is Tonje.  Another big happening today was getting my first digital camera. I got a Sony DSC-P32. Got one just like it for my brother last xmas and figured its about time I bought one for myself. Can't wait till tomorrow to test it out in daylight.

      Starting on a different web page design today. Hopefully the site will be up by the end of this month. Today I've been wondering about what to do this summer. I have a few options in mind but need to get going if I want to do any of it. Summer is coming soon.   Work life thoughts: I wonder how come people seem to have an builtin ability to find something to nag about went it comes to their employer. As soon as you get higher up in the system you nag about the ones one step above you. At the same time the ones below you in the hierarchy keep on nagging about you and you all of a sudden think this should no longer take place since you are not one of "them" anymore. Funny how no one seems to see the fact that this is an evil circle and that nothing good will come out of it. I am not claiming to be without blame for the continuum of this circle, but I definitely think it all should stop. This circle is probably the number one cause of bad teamwork.Wonder who invented the whole thought :)

      Got back home today after a couple of days of helping my brother. Went to the movies and caught Cold Mountain. It was pretty good, I would say a 4+. Need to get going with some excel sheets now...

      I'm going to pick up my brother in a few hours. He's coming home from a two week trip to Baltimore. 3 or 4 times a year his friends go there to buy back seats for vans. They fill up a container or two and ship them back home. Why would u do that? Well, we have a lot of "funny" laws in this country. One of these laws goes like this: it costs less to register a new van without back seats, than one with. Totally crazy if u ask me... But after a year or so (I'm not sure how long) when the van is no longer new you can put in seats for little or no cost. Strange!  Of course a lot of people do this. So this is where these guys come in. They get orders for seats of this and that type/make and go over to Pennsylvania and neighboring states to get them. So even with the cost of traveling, buying the seats, shipping + getting them into the counrty(toll) they make a decent amount of money on it( and they get a nice trip).Of course they have a large customer group who preorder the stuff before they take the trip. So they know they have made the money when they go. So my brother go with them every now and then. He helps out with the business and gets a few favors like free shipment for his own stuff. He also likes to go over to the states every possibility that comes around. I wish I could go on trips like that a few times a year. It's a great way to get the best out of the two countries. But as a small consolation I'm going to take a USA shopping trip sometime during this next year..

      A little boy goes to his dada and asks "whats politics?". The dads like alright let me try to explain it like this: I'm the breadwinner of the family, so lets call me capitalism. Your mom is the administrator of the money, so lets call her the government. Were here to take care of your needs, so lets call you the people. Well call the nanny the working class. Your baby brother, well call him the future. Okay now think about that and see if it makes sense. So the boy goes off to bed and thinks about what his dad said. Later that night he hears his baby brother crying so he gets up to check on him. He found that the baby soiled his diaper. So the boy goes to his parents room and finds his mom sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked he peeks into the keyhole and sees his dad in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning the little boy says to his father "dad, I think i understand the concept of politics now." The dad says "good son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is about." The boy replies "Well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored. and the future is in deep shit."...........

      Cleaned out my closet today. I must say I found some interesting stuff. T-shirts dating back to early last decade, pants I would NOT be caught dead in, and other stuff from fashion past. I am basically doing all kinds of stuff that have been put off for years these days. I'll tell you more about these escapades another day.  Last night I spent 2 hours getting some software for my brothers scanner. All because MY internet connection was down due to a thunderstorm. Oh well it got connected again today so life can start again :)
