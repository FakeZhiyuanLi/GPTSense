      So, on Saturday, after&nbsp;losing all hope in satellite television, I left&nbsp;the house to go run errands.&nbsp; I got back a little before 5 and there was a voice mail from&nbsp;Audrey atBaker Pool &amp; Satellite and she wanted&nbsp;me to know that it was 2:20 p.m. and if I could call her back in the next five minutes she could get the owner out to my house today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Today I called and spoke to Tara who said she would have the owner call me.&nbsp;&nbsp; But he never did.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I&nbsp; did  make progress on one point, however, and that is to find the website for the FCC that gives instructions on how to make a complaint:&nbsp;  urlLink www.fcc.gov  &nbsp; Next time&nbsp;I'll tell you why this is called bullfog.&nbsp;&nbsp; Either that or I'll rant some more about those&nbsp;incompetent, lying bastards.&nbsp;

       Wednesday 6/9  - I called DirecTV to order satellite service. Chad, the sales guy, told me the way it works: DirecTV ships the equipment via UPS, and an installer calls within two business days of delivery to arrange installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Monday 6/14  - UPS received my equipment and began&nbsp;its shipping process.   Tuesday 6/15  - The UPS driver left voice mail at 10:18 a.m., reporting that he could not find the address and asking me to call and give directions.   Tuesday 6/15  - I called UPS that evening and gave detailed instructions on finding the house. UPS said they would reschedule the delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Thurday 6/17  - Volunteer Satellite called and left voice mail asking when they could come to install my dish.   Friday 6/18  - I received a postcard from UPS saying that the address they had was incorrect and they could not find my house so I needed to go pick up the package.   Friday 6/18  - I called UPS to ask why I now had to go get the package instead of rescheduling the delivery as we had discussed previously. The operator said I was talking to a national call center and they would forward my question to the local UPS office.   Friday 6/18  - I got a call from the local UPS office at 3:58 p.m. and she said they had not received my original instructions from the call center. I repeated them and she arranged to reschedule delivery for Monday 6/21.   Monday 6/21  - I stayed home from work to accept delivery from UPS. The UPS driver called at 1:32 p.m. to verify the address information. He told me he expected to arrive in the late afternoon and said I did not actually need to be present to accept delivery. At 5:15 p.m., I left the house. At approximately 6:30 p.m. he left a note on the door saying that he was sorry, but that I needed to sign for the package and I should call to reschedule delivery. I called his cell phone and asked him what he was thinking when he told me I did not need to be here. He recognized that it was largely a rhetorical question and he arranged to reschedule the delivery for my office in Lexington.   Tuesday 6/22  - I received a call at 6:59 a.m. from a guy who said he wanted to come by to install the satellite dish. I told him I had actually not received the equipment yet, but I expected to receive it that day so could we schedule a time? He said he wasn’t allowed to schedule service calls.   Tuesday 6/22  - The box was delivered to my office. It looked like they had kicked it here from Tennessee.   Tuesday 6/22  - I called Volunteer Satellite and scheduled the installation for 6/24.   Thursday 6/24  - I stayed home from the office and at about&nbsp;2:00 p.m. a shirtless guy showed up in my driveway in a beat up blue pickup. He was quite sullen, but not actively hostile,&nbsp;so I showed him the sorry state of the equipment and showed him where the wires came out of the house. He installed the satellite dish on a pole in the ground at the additional expense of $30, paid in cash. He asked me to sign some comically inaccurate customer service surveys and assurances about what services I had received during his visit and then put me on the phone with Pegasus and left before I knew he was gone.   Tuesday 7/6  - I arrived home from a weekend out of town and the satellite was out. The last thing Tivo had recorded was on Saturday, July 3. I ran through the troubleshooting steps, but could not restore service.   Wednesday 7/7  - I called Pegasus from work to report the problem and schedule a service call. The guy said that he could not schedule a service call since I was not at home, but not to worry because they were open 24 hours a day and I could call later. I asked why we could not schedule it now and he said there were troubleshooting things they needed to run through with me. I told him I had already done the troubleshooting recommended, that the manual said, if you have tested all these things, time to call a professional. He said, yes, but it could be a problem with the receiver. I asked him if he seriously believed that both receivers had gone out at exactly the same time and he admitted that was probably not the case here. Nevertheless, the service department would reject the call if I was not at home.   Wednesday 7/7  - I called Pegasus from home that evening and spoke with somebody in their technical service department. He put me through a hilarious troubleshooting exercise and then admitted I probably needed a service call. Unfortunately, they cannot schedule the service calls at night. He’d put it in a queue and the service person would contact me.   Thursday 7/8  - I called Pegasus from home and told them I still had not heard from the service tech. She said, that was funny because they were going to schedule it with the same organization I had used previously and so they should have called by now. I told her I did not want that and told her why: The shirtless guy was incompetent and charged me $30 in cash on top of it. She transferred me to a supervisor who said, well, you’re not supposed to pay them, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. We have rules, can’t switch service providers, blah, blah, blah, they hooked me up with a new service provider that would call me.   Friday 7/9  - I called Pegasus and reported I still had not heard from the new service company. I asked her to give me their number so I could call them.&nbsp; She identified&nbsp;Baker Service Co. as the new source of all my problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;I called the number and a woman answered the phone, "Baker Pools" - I expressed my confusion and she said, well, yes, it’s Baker Pool and Satellite. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, guy is out of town, she can't schedule service calls, blah, blah, blah, he’ll call me&nbsp;next Tuesday.   Tuesday 7/13  - At 3:00 p.m. I still had not heard from Baker Pool &amp; Satellite.&nbsp; For reasons I cannot articulate other than having a confidence right down to my bones that I was not going to receive a call, I called Pegasus and spoke to Michael. Michael was, of course, very apologetic (just like every other person I've talked to), and he set up a&nbsp;3- way conference call with me, Baker Pool &amp; Satellite and himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Baker Pool and Satellite was represented&nbsp;by the same woman I had spoken to on 7/9 and Michael asked her if she had gotten the service order yet. She said she didn’t know, she’d have to check. She left the phone and returned saying, yes, they had received the service order. I asked if we could schedule a service call and she spoke to someone there with her, a male voice, asking when would be the best time. I did not hear his response. She said he could come&nbsp;out on Saturday. I said that I lived in Boone’s Trace, could she give me some idea of when he might appear. She told me he said 10 or 11 am.   Saturday 7/17  - I called at 12:10 pm and told Tara at Baker Pool &amp; Satellite that I had not seen the service guy yet and maybe he was having a problem finding the place. Tara admitted she didn’t know because all the servicemen were in the field. I asked if she had a list of the scheduled service calls and she said no, but she’d call around and see if she could find out. Tara called back about 10 minutes later and said she’d spoken to the owner and he didn’t know anything about it so he probably wouldn’t be out today. She did assure me, however, that he’ll call me.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Bwa ha ha ha ha!!!!

      I moved into my new house about a month ago. June 4, actually, so that's a little more than. And since then I have been struggling under the weight of the collective ineptitude of DirecTV (I don't know if that's spelled right and I don't care), UPS, Pegasus Satellite (I don't know if that's their name and I don't care) and some hippi installation guy who showed up at my house without a shirt. I'm so bored with&nbsp;people telling me how sorry they are.   It's an awful and scary story, one that I may share in all its glorious detail - but not now. Certainly you'll have heard it long before I ever expect to have satellite television. For now, let's just say, I'm completely television free.   * * *   Today is a&nbsp;weird anniversary. Every year this date rolls around and I look up at the calendar and there's this, huh,  oh, shit  moment.   20 years. Jeez.   Sometimes, too - and I wouldn't say this if it wasn't the 20th anniversary - I think, gosh, that was  huge  then and now, well, it's not huge.

      A few minutes ago, I decided that today's the day to make some changes in my life. So I made these decisions:   * Golf is a welcome new obsession  * No more beer in the house (all wine all the time from here on out)  * I'm doing my toes tomorrow   I never said they were momentous decisions.

      Tomorrow, my friend Christie and I are going to record our video interview for The Amazing Race 7.   It's destiny!!!  Either that or a bit of underdone beef.

      I bought my place in June.   It's pretty nice -- much nicer than my old place -- and it sits on the fairway of one of the holes at a golf course called The Bull.  I have a view, from most of the rooms in my house, of the fairway and the fields across it.  There is a stand of trees just north of me in the middle of the fairway, and a line of trees on the other side of the fairway that gets its share of golfers beating the bushes, looking for balls.  There is a likely apocryphal story that the course got its name because this particular little piece of land used to be a farm. That farmer had a bull that used to get out and he (the farmer) was quite famous in Madison County as a guy always out looking for his bull.  Well , apparently, one time he was out looking for it and he got so angry that he chased the bull off a cliff into the river. The next time someone asked him about his bull he said, "That bull's gone to hell."  They say that happened right around here and thus, this area was called The Bull's Hell. The course is just called The Bull.  They tell the story at  urlLink www.thebullgolf.com .  I think that story tells all sorts of details about that guy's character, but, maybe I'm wrong.  * * *  Because of the way that the river wraps itself around The Bull's Hell, we have river on three sides. I don't mean to say that I have a river view, but that the river surrounds me the way that the ocean surrounds Florida.  That makes me Tampa, and the fog is amazing here in Tampa.  When I drive home late at night, I sometimes turn on my fog lights because brights simply reflect back at me. There are deer and possums and I ran over somebody's house cat once. All I could see was the fog and some flashing eyes before that cat just dove for my tires. I drove by it again the next day and it lay exactly where it had been when I hit it. It wasn't mangled or crushed and if I didn't know better, it would have looked like it was out for some morning sun in the middle of a busy highway.  But, it died there.   Honestly, that just happened or I wouldn't have mentioned it.  When I open my eyes in the morning, the fog is usually so thick that I cannot see the trees on the fairway. If I step out on the deck, the fog just lays heavy and wet and distorts sound. On days when it's thickest, when I'm driving, I have to periodically look at my hands on the steering wheel to reassure myself that the eyes still work, that I can still see.  It is like living in a bank of clouds.  A bank of clouds that has a very cool golf course.
