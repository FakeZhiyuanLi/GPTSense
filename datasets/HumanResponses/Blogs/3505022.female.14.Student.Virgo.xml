      I have stalker named David. Why he likes me, I couldn't really tell you. I don't even know if he still likes me, I hope not. He scares me shitless. He's butt ugly which makes it really bad. I mean if he was cute, that be a different story. Then I wouldn't cared if he waited for me outside the girls bathroom (yes he has done this). But the fact that he's ugly, very strange, and his lisp is always cause to make fun of him. As Tim and I did, it was so funny. He just stood there next to me and we were making fun of him and he didn't do anything. I wonder, was he stupid enough that he didn't even know? Yes, so it shall be interesting the next he see's me to see if he still likes me.

      I sit and stair at the wall Watching the world spin round’ me Feeling your arms near by I close my eyes and begin to cry  I don’t know how to say this Or even where to begin But today as you left the house I knew you would not be returning  Trust me I tried to stop you I called out your name But the noise of the truck over took me And I saw the whole thing  Your body lay dead on the drive way Your clothes were all torn I knew by the time I got out there That it was too late, you were gone  That driver was too stupid to look When he hit the side of your car He tried saying he was sorry But all that came out was a sob  I know the pain was brief And that you died before you could suffer To which I am happy God took you quickly  And I know you’re in a better place But why did you have to leave? I didn’t even get to say goodbye Please come back to me  I sit and stair at the wall Watching the world spin round’ me Feeling your arms near by I close my eyes and begin to cry

        For those who know me they know I like John. But for those you don't know, I like John Shultz (or however you spell his last name). I don't know why I like him but I just do. And John if you happen to read this, you already know that I like you, but do you know how much (hint: a lot!)?   So I just have one question, why does he like Lisa so much? Hasn't she told him that she just isn't interested in him? But that's ok because I realized something yesterday. If he is so in love with Lisa, let him because if he can't see someone who likes him who's right in front of him than I have no need for him. Why should I chase after someone who doesn't even feel the same?

         I never actually figured any of my friends would wonder their way onto this site. So to all who know me, HI! And to Sara, this is kind of like an online diary but cooler in a strange sorta way. Ok this is a short post but I wanna write about something else just not on here.

         Memorial Day, another holiday to add to the rest. Another day we have off of work or school. This holiday like so many other's have lost all meaning. What is Memorial Day? Why does our country celebrate those who fought in war when the war itself could have been avoided all together? Could it be that man kind has a thing for killing? Is that why God put us on this planet, to hate one another? To fight over stupid things such a land? We worry about being rich and making up in the world, but does it really matter? Will it matter when we die? All the riches of this world could not save our soul from damnation.    So what is Memorial Day anyway?

      Some days I ask myself why I even speak. Someone asks me for my personal thought and I get yelled at for it. So why do I speak? Because I keep getting this hope that maybe the world does care about what I have to say. Guess not.

      Summer vacation has barley started and already I'm bored. I should be studing my music for band, but I'm not in the mood. (Which means I'll never get memorized.) Not much to say because not much has happened. No one to talk to,and there's no where to go. Well there is but no where I can get to. I wish I was old enough to drive, o wouldn't that be nice! Well I think I'll go read, good bye!

      His name is Tim.It's kind a nice name isn't it? I could say it over and over again and each time it has a new meaning. Tim. If only I could make him mine and forever we would be happy. And together we would do great things in the name of love. His name is Tim.

      I've always dreamed about meeting my brother. But after once failed phone call and letter my dream of meeting him seemed to fade with each day. So today when I needed to look up an address on Map Quest the idea came into my mind. What if I tryed his address to get directions. And sure enough it gave them to me and I couldn't believe it. I had passed his street a houndred times in the past year or so. I couldn't believe my luck. But then reality set in and I realized that my dad will never take me to go see him. But who knows, maybe I can find someone else to take me. Friends maybe considering non of my family members would take me. So maybe I could bribe some people tonight to go for a little road trip. It could happen (only in my dreams)!

        So it's been a while. Sorry. Got lost up in so many things. So much has happened and yet it's been so boring. Haha! Well I know I've talked about 2 different guyz on here and how much I've like them but I've been over them for such a long time. And yes sadly I like someone else.... But this time he's an ex-boyfriend. How sad! What's worse is that we've broken up and gotten back togeth so many times that I'm afriad of people might say IF we got back together. But I doubt that we well, I've told him that I still feel for him but he hasn't responded. And I know he's gotten it because he's like a computer freak (but a good freak!). Well before I bore you all into dream land. Goodnight!
