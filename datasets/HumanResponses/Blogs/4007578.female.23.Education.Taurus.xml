      As a future public school teacher, I am happy to hear John Edwards talk about school funding and equal opportunities for all of our children, and I'm even happier to note that the rhetoric of NCLB was conspicuously absent from the speech.&nbsp; (Yeah!)&nbsp; I'll wait to hear GWB speak next month before I trash him though. =)

      I've become addicted to audio books - it's such a bad habit!&nbsp; This summer I've only read one or two books, but I've listened to four times that many books on CD.&nbsp; Currently I'm "reading" Mitch Albom's  The Five People you Meet in Heaven .&nbsp; I'm only on disc two of five (who knows what chapter that could be!), and though I&nbsp;like it, it's not as if I can't tear myself away.&nbsp; My first delve into the foray of audio books was the abridged version of  The DaVinci Code .&nbsp; It was great to have all the French pronunciations correct and the great French accents, and I couldn't get out of my car when I pulled into the driveway.&nbsp;   I have those sort of driveway moments when I'm listening to NPR too, but the beauty of the audio books is that I can eject the CD and bring it inside to my CD player and continue to listen while I wash the dishes or take a shower.&nbsp; The only down side to the two habits, NPR and audio books, is that they are both quite uncomfortable for any car passengers.&nbsp; I can't bring myself to listen to either when I'm not alone in the car.

      We spent the day at Yankee Springs hiking.&nbsp; It was beautiful, and it couldn't have been a nicer day.&nbsp; We hiked down and back up Devil's Soup Bowl - that'll take your breath away...Literally.&nbsp; Just when I thought that I wouldn't make it any further we sat down for&nbsp; lesson about Elijah.&nbsp; That brought to mind the verse in James (5:17, I think) where it says "Elijah was a man JUST LIKE US....."&nbsp; Hard to believe, isn't it?&nbsp; Somehow I've made all the OT saints into some kind of mythological creatures.&nbsp; I'm like, sure Moses led an entire people group out of oppression, but Spider Man saved New York, and he's got a better stylist!&nbsp; But these guys were REAL!&nbsp; It's amazing, really.&nbsp; Elijah must have had more faith in his toenails than I have in my entire body.&nbsp; I'm ashamed.&nbsp; Here I am, a middle class American with a comfortable home, a decent car, a great education, access to my church family, God's word, and incredible resources, and I'm the one who sometimes doubts God's abilities.   You know why I don't have more faith?&nbsp; Because I don't need it!&nbsp; I don't attempt to live a life that requires more than my own strength.&nbsp; I don't do great things, but I do them alone!&nbsp; That's no life though, God created us with a need for community and a need for Him.&nbsp; I'm going to start praying for a life that goes beyond self-sufficiency.

      Good freak I'm tired!&nbsp; This startin' the day at the crack of dawn thing is for the birds.&nbsp; It's like 9 at night, but I'm ready for bed.   Regardless, it was a productive day.&nbsp; I helped move Ben and Larissa into their new house today, and we got so much done.&nbsp; There is something so wonderful about having a tidy, organized home where you're happy to invite your family and friends.&nbsp; (Not that I would know!)&nbsp; My house is a disaster area 99% of the time.&nbsp; It is seriously a major, long-term goal to be disciplined enough to keep it clean.&nbsp; I always intent to keep up with it, but then I get so busy and the laundry starts piling up and I start to make piles of my junk everywhere.&nbsp; Soon I look around and realize that my&nbsp; house might appear tidier if it was hit by a tornado.   I wish I didn't have to be paranoid about a friend stopping by for a surprise visit or (worse yet) my mom coming over when I'm not home to borrow my iron or something crazy like that.&nbsp; I'm ashamed of the mess!   At this very moment I know I should be cleaning up my kitchen, but alas, I'm exhausted!&nbsp;

      I've been home from South Africa for three months, and I'm ready to get movin' again.&nbsp; The prospect of another year in this, the smallest of small towns, makes me itch.&nbsp; I think I'm getting a rash; it rubs the wrong way.&nbsp; Delton, despite its occasional charm, is more beautiful from the outside looking in.&nbsp; While I was away I did miss some of the quirky comforts of home, but that doesn't diminish my desire to see the world.&nbsp;   TWENTY places I want to see (or see again) before I'm FORTY:    London  Greece  The Philippines  New York City  The Rocky mountains  San Diego  New Zealand  Maine  North Carolina  South Africa  Victoria Falls  Turkey  Israel  Munich  Bolivia  Egypt  India  The Upper peninsula  Djibouti  Tsitsikamma

       I've found that the summer drains from me all sense of urgency.&nbsp; This is a problem, of course, because it is the summer, of all seasons, which must be seized, exploited, and lived to the hilt.&nbsp; (Un)fortunately, it is the nature of my summer schedule that I am not expected out of bed until after 9 in the morning, and I do try to live up to the expectations held of me.&nbsp;   I just finished listening to an audio-book by James Patterson titled  Sam's Letters to Jennifer .&nbsp; It's a light-weight, fluff novel, perfect for summer "reading", and although it's not worth a re-read or an in-depth study, I did find one particular quote to be quite charming:&nbsp; "I'm going to live every day from the crack of dawn until I can't keep my eyes open any longer."   Sounds like a good idea and all, but if I'm supposed to be up with the sunset, I'm going to have to stop with all these late nights!
