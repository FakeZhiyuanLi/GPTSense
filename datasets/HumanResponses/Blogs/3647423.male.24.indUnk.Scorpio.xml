      I want to take this time to wish my dad a great father's day.  He's a few states away, so I won't be able to celebrate with him.  We had a kind of distant relationship most of my life.  It wasn't a bad relationship, but I was kind of intimidated by him.  He's the type of person who seems serious most of the time.  I don't think I ever recall him having a really great time.  There's smile here and there, but that was about it.  He had a problem managing his anger, and this is a problem I have, but I don't think it is as bad as how he was.  When I was little, I recalled many times when he would absolutely go off and have a temper tantrum.  There would be lots of yelling, and things would break.  It was kind of scary, so I would keep my distance.  Nowadays, things are way better.  Ever since I moved away, it was easier for me to talk to him and learn more about his past.  He's getting up there at 74, and I've always wondered about his life.  When he was in his early teen years, he moved to Colombia in South America.  I'm not sure the reason, yet, but I think it had something to do with World War 2.  He was child in China when the second Sino-Japanese War started.  He told me that the Japanese soldiers did many terrible things.  They lived out in the country, and the Japanese gassed a lot of the areas near his home.  He went to some of the homes shortly after, and saw a lot of families dead in their houses from the poisoning.  There were many other times when my dad and his family had to run from their house because the Japanese were shooting at all the civilians.  One time, he even heard bullets whizzing right by him.  There were many close calls, and he almost lost his mother when soldiers were starting to break into his house.  My grandmother was still in the house when they finally broke in, but she was able to escape without them seeing her.  When they came back one time, their home was completely ransacked, and they were left with no food.  I don't know the chronological order these events happened, but these were some of the few things he told me.  He then moved to Colombia to his uncle's home, and lived many years there.  He became very fluent in Spanish as a result.  I think he eventually moved to Hong Kong, because I think that's how he met my mom.  I would definitely like to hear more about it, but there is somewhat of a language barrier between us.  I'm not that strong at Chinese anymore, and he never taught me Spanish.  I speak mostly English, which is what he's weak at.  Do you ever hear of people using the term "Spanglish"?  It's where people mix Spanish and English when they talk.  I guess you can say that my dad speaks to me in "Spanese".  To this day, he still feels a lot of bitterness towards Japan.  I think that it has a lot to do with the Japanese government's refusal to officially acknowledge the crimes they committed throughout all of Asia.  All of this fascinated me, and it compelled me to go out and purchase a book called The Rape of Nanking by Iris Chang.  It's a very good read, and it's one of my favorite books on history.  I still need to call him tonight.  I try hard to call him every Sunday and talk.  I get really worried about him because his health is turning for the worse and he feels he's not going to be around much longer.  I feel such a huge need to move into my parents house and help take care of him.  He spends most of his days at home, while my mother works full-time.  I'm out here in Oklahoma and it's constantly on my mind.  It would be nice to take him to a couple of NBA and MLB games, like the old days.

      One of my favorite hobbies is to mix it up and scratch on my turntables.  I've been constantly doing this for a while.  I haven't done any gigs.  I've been invited once to help do one in Houston, and I've had several people ask me to be in their band.  You can call me a "bedroom dj".  It's something that I'm happy to be, and it's something I'd rather be then to try to go out and rock a party.  It takes so much stress away when I'm on them.  It definitely is relaxing.  I think I'm pretty good at it.  I think it kind of started when my brother and I used to play with my grandma's old belt-drive turntable.  We used to take her records and start scratching.  Boy, did we get in trouble!  We were huge fans of rap back in the 80's, my brother used to breakdance all the time.  The whole time, I was still trying to learn the robot dances, which I'm still terrible at.  Those were the days, when all the great beats came out.  Old school rap was the best.  My brother used to rap along with the song Paul Revere.  That is still one of my favorite songs, and it always reminded me of my brother.  One of my friends from back home called me and told me that he and a friend of his are trying to set up a hip-hop class at my old college.  He called and asked if I would like to help.  Of course, I agreed to it.  He's just wondering when I'll be back there.  It would definitely be great!  It seems there are more and more schools offering classes on dj'ing.  It's kind of odd, but I'm all for it.

      Have you ever gotten an e-mail from someone asking you to help them transfer millions of dollars into your accounts?  They say that in return, they will give you a large percentage of it.  Of course, this is a scam.  I've read many stories about how people get duped out of thousands of dollars.  I never really thought about these scams much, until I heard a couple of cases where peoples' lives were destroyed.  There was a single mother who sold everything she had, and even sent her baby's food money.  She was left with nothing, and she even told the scammer, but he kept pressing.  He kept telling her that it will be okay when she gets evicted, or when her baby's starving, because she will never have to worry about money soon.  There was another victim who was already in debt, and when he saw the message from someone claiming to be royalty, he jumped at the chance to help.  He thought it was his way out, but when he realized it was a scam, he later lit himself on fire and burned to death.  There are people out there that are fighting back.  They are called scam baiters.  Their whole purpose is to get these scammers to correspond with them, so they can waste there resources and time.  That way, less time will be spent with potential victims.  Many times, these scam baiters will get the scammers to take humiliating pictures of themselves.  They could have them hold up signs that says something funny, do stupid things, or even have them get photographed naked.  I thought I would try a bit a of scam baiting myself.  I set up an email account, a voicemail number, and a fax number strictly for this.  They don't have any of my personal information.  I use a fake name, my voicemail number is in Seattle, and my fax number is somewhere in Illinois.  I have some correspondence going on with 3 or 4 of those guys, so maybe I'll post a voicemail message or something soon.   urlLink Check out this NY Times article   You can get a username and password at  urlLink http://www.bugmenot.com/

      Okay, I'm a bit late, but I wanted to talk about the NBA Finals.  I've always felt that the Pistons were the only team in the Eastern Conference to even have a chance at winning the Finals.  Shoot, I never thought that they would actually WIN it, let alone destroy the Lakers doing it.  It should've been a sweep if Kobe didn't hit that miracle tre in Game 2.  Congrats to the Pistons, they've definitely earned it.  As for Chauncey Billups, it's cool that he is the Finals MVP, and he isn't even an All-Star, yet.  It goes to show that you don't need to be an All-Star to bring it.  So what's in store for the Lakers?  I don't think Malone or Payton will be back.  I think Malone already said he will opt out of his contract.  There are lots of rumors Kobe will leave the Lakers to go play for the Clippers or the Suns.  I really doubt that will happen.  I think he will stay a Laker.  As for Shaq, there are already trade rumors swirling around him.  I highly doubt he will be traded, even if he or Lakers want it.  He's going to make $30 million next season, and I just don't see any team out there that would afford that.  I can see that at the end of his contract, he will try to go back to Orlando.  I think he has a year or two in his current contract.  He'll go to Orlando, where he'll retire, and then purchase the Magic.  Phil Jackson won't be back.  He already said there was a slim chance he would be back.

      I wrote this to my brother on October 17, 1999, shortly after I found out he died.  I guess you can say it was therapeutic.   Subject: Hey Bro  I was hoping to see you around Christmas, but I guess it's going to be sooner than I thought.  I want you to understand that this is not a goodbye from me.  This is just what I have wanted to tell you for the longest time.  It's still hard for me to accept the fact that my big bro, my only brother, is no longer going to beat me up, get mad at me, allow me to annoy you, or play basketball and video games with me.  I don't even know where to start.  You mean so much to me.  You gave me so much advice and opened up a whole new world for me.  I used to think that music was only rap and as far as theatre, it would be just the movies.  You helped me realize that there was country music, jazz, opera, and just about anything out there that exists.  I know you were a big fan of Yanni, too.  I don't know if I like his music, yet, though.  Hehe!!  Maybe if I get a chance to listen some more, I will hear what you heard.  You were the person that got me hooked on Les Miserables, Jeckyll and Hyde, Phantom of the Opera, and a lot of Shakespeare stuff.  You used to go to the library all the time and check out those videos of plays and had me watch them too.  I didn't realize how much was out in this world until you opened my eyes.  Out of all the people that I have met, you have changed my life the most.  I became more involved in theatre and music in high school.  You helped me decide to go to school in (college) without even telling me what to do.  You just guided me to what I wanted to do.  You had me so determined when I got to (college).  I thought that maybe in the future, we would've been working side by side.  I would be the electronics and aviation expert and you would be the software, computer engineer, and networking expert.  I guess this plan won't happen the way I imagined, but you are still in my plans.  That's for sure.  I have so much to thank you for!  You probably know by now that you made me appreciate all aspects of art a lot more.  That was the biggest change in my life and it was because of you.  Thank you for being the one to go out of your way to come and see me in my plays and other performances.  I knew how busy your schedule was and it meant so much for you to still come.  You knew that I always did the same for you in your choir performances.  Maybe sometimes I was late, but I seem to always make it for your parts.  The thing I remember most about your choir is when you all did an Old MacDonald's song.  That was so funny!  Thank you on all the advice you gave me.  I remember how I would go crying to you about relationships and things like that.  You had that sixth sense of somehow being able to read one's mind and I'm sure many people will agree with me on that.  It even came to a point when my friends would even ask to speak to you about anything.  You had this reputation of being an advisor to all of us.  Again, thank you for everything.  No matter how old I get, you will always be my big brother.  I love you.  (signed)

      Today is my brother's birthday.  He would be turning 30 today.  He died on October 16, 1999, which was 10 days before my birthday.  I was away for college, so I wasn't there when he died.  It was very unexpecting news when I received a phone call from my mother the morning after he died.  I was asleep, but my friend was there because she was doing laundry at my apartment.  She woke me up and gave me the phone.   Mom: "Were you asleep?" Me: "Yeah..." Mom: "Did your friend spend the night there?" Me: "Yeah, she was up all night doing her laundry." Mom: "Can you come home?" Me: "Why?" Mom: "Your brother's not here."    At this point, I thought maybe my brother moved away for a job, or went to another college.  I just stayed quiet.    Mom: "Your brother died last night."    I'm in shock. After, a few seconds it finally hits me.  Were both crying.    Mom: "He was really sick these past couple of months.  I need to call your uncle.  Go find out about some plane tickets for this coming weekend.  I'll call you back."   That was the end of it.  I'm just balling my eyes out and my friend is trying to comfort me the whole time.  I remember only talking to him a few days before.  He seemed fine, and we were both talking about how the Mets recently eliminated the Diamondbacks in the NL semi-finals.  I was even getting e-mails from him.  I really miss him.  I turned to him a lot when I needed advice, so to this day, I still feel like a lost dog.  Well, I wrote him a letter after I found out that day.  I guess I'll post that soon, when I find it.

      Five freakin' years in freakin' Oklahoma.  I need to leave!  The whole state is boring, the weather is terrible, and there are huge bloodsucking bugs everywhere.  The drivers are crazy, and a lot of the teenagers here think they are hardcore gangsters.  After a couple of years, I did settle down a bit, and I did accept that I was here.  Then all of a sudden, it hits me!  This place still blows.

      I hope everyone is enjoying the holiday weekend.  I'm not doing much.  I'm just going to stay home.  Last year for the fourth, I went to Oklahoma City, which was okay.  It definitely is a lot better than the other times I went there.  There is a tiny bit more to do there than in Tulsa.  We saw fireworks from the hotel.  There were a few shows all over the city.  We also went to the zoo, the Titanic Exhibit, and the bombing memorial.  They also have this little place in downtown that is very similar to that river place in San Antonio.  It was nice there.  There were a lot of places to eat in the area and a lot of live music.  Well, have fun!  I'm really freaking bored, so I'll probably just skratch it up a bit.

      Well, it looks like Kobe will stay in LA.  I was hoping my Suns would sign him, but I knew that it would not happen.  Instead, the Suns will bring back Steve Nash.  I like Nash a lot, and I think he's a better fit for the Suns than Marbury, even though Marbs is the best point guard in the league.  The only thing is that the contract Nash verbally agreed to is too large.  I think it would average out to $13 million per year.  Oh, well.  It will make the team better, and the next step is to sign a big man, most likely Mehmet Okur.
