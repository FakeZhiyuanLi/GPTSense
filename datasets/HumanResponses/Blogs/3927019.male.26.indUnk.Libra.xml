      I was trying to start revamping my website when my alarm went off. Hmmm... i wonder why ...   Whne I rushed to my phone, the alarm came with a message "Channel 73." It was then I remembered that I needed to watch a show on the National Geographic Channel called "Taboo" which showcased "Extreme Cuisine" that night.  The show was everything I expected it to be. Gross but extremely fascinating. It even featured the Filipino delicacy "Balut" (steamed duck embryo).  That ruined my appetite that night but I can't wait and show it to my coworkers later for lunch. lol!

      The heat was terrible yesterday. The minute I got home, I turned the AC on and was just too damn lazy to go to the gym or return some stuff I bought at Target the other day.  I decided to play around with my new P900. To all the "techies" out there, I highly recommend the phone. I just love it! (Of course I know one person who would beg to differ ... right David? - who by the way is an O2 XDAII owner)  I started to test the speakerphone feature by calling some of my friends/family. Here is a list of people I called and a gist of what we talked about:  1. My family in PA. - My grandmother's doing great. For the past few weeks, my aunt told me that she had no appetite and was feeling very weak. I'm glad she's feeling better now. I can't wait to see them on September. Also, they were telling me that it was raining hard in the east coast.  2. Cherry - Cherry is my cousin who's getting married in Reno this August. She said that she is doing great and she can't wait to see me next month. I'm not sure yet if I'll go there by plane or by renting a car.  3. Erica - Erica's my former coworker who now works for the city of San Bernardino. Her last day at our workplace was last Friday. She said she was fine but was very busy with orientation. She said that she missed us so much and promised she'll call or email us soon.  4. Ian - Ian's one of my dear college friends who is based in San Francisco. He was telling me that his deck caught on fire and now he has to demolish the whole thing this weekend and replace it with a new one.  So after making those calls, I setup my powerbook to record "Last Comic Standing" and "The Amazing Race 5" with my EyeTV (which I think is a Godsend). I also bought some songs at iTunes. Most of them were old songs.  Maybe this weekend I would be able to start on my new website. My website really needs an update.

      It was no surprise for me that John won the contest.  He is such a funny and natural guy plus he reminds me so much of Ray Romano.  I think this second season is much better than the first one. :)  The Amazing Race 5 is my current favorite show. I also heard that the contestants are going to the Philippines pretty soon so I'm looking forward to seeing that. Hope they eat BALUT or something. he he he  The Summer Olympics opening is later this evening so of course I have set my EyeTV to record it. I'm sure it'll be a blast. :)
