      Hey George the lesser, reading is fundamental:   In his memoirs, "A World Transformed," written five years ago, George Bush Sr. wrote the following to explain why he didn't go after Saddam Hussein at the end of the Gulf War.   "Trying to eliminate Saddam...would have incurred incalculable human and political costs. Apprehending him was probably impossible. We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq. There was no viable "exit strategy" we could see, violating another of our principles. Furthermore, we had been consciously trying to set a pattern for handling aggression in the post-Cold War world. Going in and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally exceeding the United Nations' mandate, would have destroyed the precedent of international response to aggression that we hoped to establish. Had we gone the invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land."

      Well, a great time was had by all. I just got back from a 7 day Mexico cruise and it was great. It was so nice to relax and not worry about a thing. It was also nice to wear a swimsuit by the pool and not be totally mortified!   We are in convention season now, and I was really amazed at Bill Clinton last night. He is such an amazing speaker. I am certain that if he ran today he would get elected. Jimmy Carter was great too. It was fun to see such a mild mannered guy go after the Reps. like he did.   As I get back into the swing of things I am going to have to get caught up on the political comings and goings. It was nice to have an a-political week however.   Adios for now.  J

      I was talking to someone yesterday and it reminded me of two of the funniest things that people have said to me when they find out I had WLS:  &nbsp;  1. Why on earth did you get that? You don't need that!  &nbsp;  Must I remind them that when I had the surgery I weighed more, what they are looking at are the results!  &nbsp;  2.&nbsp; By looking at you I would never have known you had been heavy!  &nbsp;  What does a formerly heavy person look like? Do we hold some visible scars from our weight that are apparent to all we see?  &nbsp;  Anyway, they are not offensive at all, just kind of cute, and really they are compliments if you look beyond the "confusion".

      Nuff on the politicking for a moment. Let's talk about my gastric bypass.  As seen at  urlLink wls.theprincesses.net , I have lost a heck of a lot of weight in the last year. My 1 year WLS anniversary is coming on July 29. I have gone from 286.5 to 150ish. I am pleased as can be buying my size 2-8 clothing and I feel great.   I went to a plastic surgeon on Tuesday.  urlLink Dr. Shamoun  seems to be a great guy, and very qualified. Of course this is not a medically necessary procedure so it is going to cost me about 28k if I go with him.  He was very reassuring however. A tummy tuck, a lift of the old bootie and a medial thigh lift will get rid of the skin. This could be done in two operations. The thigh lift is to be done alone, I guess it is trickier. He showed me by a lot of yanking and pulling at the skin that I don't really have much fat on me at all. He even said, look at that, do you see any fat on you? I don't.  That was nice to hear.  I do have a hernia, which is something to consider as I visit other surgeons. I am going to try and get a referral so another doctor that is in my health insurance and might be able to do the tummy and hernia together and get insurance to cover it. I don't want to choose a doctor just because it will cost me less. I want the right doctor for the job.  I will keep you posted.  Julianna

       urlLink House GOP Leaders Kill Effort to Limit Patriot Act   Well this one has me a bit stumped. The McCarthy like Patriot Act is steaming forward threatening the civil liberties of all of us. Be careful what you check out from the library or buy from your local book seller... You might be monitored for your selections.  I am trying to picture a scenario... One that I am making up for the sake of argument and not out of paranoia... Let's say I write a letter to President Cheney or the meat stick with a head that talks for him, George Bush. If on the odd chance someone gets that letter and reads it and does not like it, perhaps considers it a threat to the ideology the administration holds near and dear. If my letter rubs someone the wrong way, it is possible that a small investigation could be launched... Small because I really am not important to anyone outside a small group of friends and family in the western US. So let's take this pretend investigation to it's potential end... Satan Ashcroft gets a call to find out what books this highly subversive single mom customer service manager may have read in the past couple of years. Well I am busted aren't I? First there are the dozens of Buddhism books I have purchased... What? She is not a Christian? Strike One. Holy Crap, she bought some books by the self described eco terrorist Edward Abby... The Monkey Wrench Gang? Is she saying by this purchase that it would be okay to go to Alaska and mess with the equipment there to halt any efforts in oil exploration? Would she really put carpet tacks in the roads in front of logging equipment to disable them?  Well, had I the energy and resources... No seriously, this strike two on my reading habits would simply show that at some point I bought my then husband Kent a gift by one of his favorite authors. Wow, check this out, not only is she not a Christian, but she bought some Harry Potter books, yikes she is a Satanist. (Ashcroft would know LOL). Then there are the Al Franken books, the House of Bush House of Saud, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton books. I am so screwed.  Now I get a knock at my door, it is some scary dude in a dark suit and one of those ear things that allow him to listen to some dark figure somewhere. I am under arrest... But not really arrest, as I am not read my rights. I am hauled off to some cell somewhere unable to make a call, see a lawyer.   America, what a country.   Of course this is not going to happen to me. I am no one really.  I am so no one I am even off my own radar. I write this thing that only I read, but it makes me feel better.

      There are two sites of note found today on a very special quest:   urlLink http://www3.sympatico.ca/jenoff/obit.htm  and  urlLink http://lifeinlegacy.com   Steve and I were trying to figure out if Marlon Brando was the third in the threesomes of famous deaths we are always trying to pull together. We found these two sites that track the deaths of famous people.  It is weird to see what some people are known for once they pass. I always thought of Gordon Jump as the guy in WKRP, but no he is known more for being the Maytag Repair Man. Go figure.  So we are figuring that we are beginning a new threesome. We had Reagan, Ray Charles and Marlon Brando. Who will be next and why do we want to know? I actually have this funny little saying for Saturday mornings.  I get up, get my coffee and whatever breakfast I am going to have, I grab the remote and say, usually out loud, "Let's see who died last night".  Then I click on CNN Headline News.  Seems like a weird thing but frequently I will turn that on and find out some famous person died the night before or that morning. Do they wait for Friday night/Saturday morning to give the weekend news more to talk about than a week in review?  I am just as fascinated with the famous as a lot of people are. I know some people who are a bit overboard on it however. I don't find People Magazine to be any more reliable than the National Enquirer. People is the National Enquirer for those who can read. I will catch an episode of Inside The Actors Studio or Biography, even Headliners and Legends if it is someone interesting. I will even sit still for an E True Hollywood Story now and again. I don't know why.  It is theorized that we enjoy the lives of celebs because the seem so much better than ours. I don't think so. I have rarely had a problem that throwing some paparazzi, a disguise or a bad review at could have made it better. Is it the money? If you make a lot of money just to spend it on putting a fence around your house, hiring a body guard and renting out a restaurant just so you can have a peaceful meal then it is not worth it in my book.  Don't get me wrong. If I were famous and actually felt like I contributed either great art or great works to society than great, whoopeeeee. But I don't want to be famous for making a movie about fart jokes. (I will watch it, believe me I will watch it and laugh my ass off).  When you are an Audrey Hepburn and you die, your obituary says wonderful things. What will Courtney Love's obit say? There it is, the great art vs. the fart joke.

      It's a short week, the independence Day Holiday saw fit to land in a way that gave me an extra day off. How nice. It's funny how time is different when you are a grown up. I used to count the hours until 3pm when school was off and I could dash home, do a half assed job at whatever it was I was required to do so that I had MY TIME. What did I do with my time? Oh whatever I wanted and sometimes nothing. There was playing with the neighbor kids, roller skating, barbies, TV or just a good old fashion fight with my little brother.  Later it became work. I would leave school to go to work, and leave work to go to MY TIME. Now my time was boys, driving around town aimlessly looking for something to do, talking on the phone, hassling my parents, TV or just a good old fashion fight with my little brother.  I am still a clock watcher but I watch for smaller increments. I watch for lunch time. On days like today when I roll into the office around 6am, I start wondering when lunch will get here at about 9am. Lunch used to be at 12:00 noon, but it somehow turned into 11:30 about a year or so ago. We still finish up around 1, don't ask me how that happened.  Mind you I am not waiting for the food. I could care less about the food, I just want MY TIME. (30 minutes of which I am apparently stealing from my boss). At lunch I glance at the paper, eat a bit and play cards. We have been playing rummy 500 for the better part of 2 years. We stop a few days and then get bored and start up again. Before the 2 year stint we had a break for about a year. All told this game has been going on for about 6 years.  So, back at the desk at 1pm to start watching the clock again. I get more work done than it may seem, but the clock sits there on the bottom right corner of my screen, another to the left of my monitor, the watch on my wrist and the other clock to my right. Since I was in at 6am today, I am off at 3. At 3 starts MY TIME again. I will dash off to therapy where I will try to sort out the stories of my week to determine how badly I have been treating those I love and those who love the ones I love. I will try to deal with an ailing self esteem that has no clue that it is okay to be 5'9" and 150 lbs., and even if it wasn't just perfect, who cares. Who cares if the world thinks I am attractive. After all, this is MY TIME and I can look like I want.  (See, short attention span, I am wandering off again, let's look at the clock just to check in).  What do I do when I get home? Do you really care? Perhaps you do because perhaps you think you are not making the most of your time, and seeing what I do with MY TIME will make you feel better. Yesterday I drove the 40 miles home while listening to a book on CD. This is my new thing. I am obsessed with it. The current "read" is Al Franken's diatribe on lies and the liars that tell them. I am really enjoying this one. It makes me laugh out loud while driving... that is fun. Since I drive about 1 hour and 30 minutes a day, this book should be done by the end of my short week, and I may move on to one of my Lama Surya Das books on Buddhism.  So I got home, started some spaghetti sauce, made a cup of vanilla coffee and took the California section of the la times out on the patio. I tried to get Kelsey to do her math while I sat out there. That turned into a battle. Once you become a mom, your time is their time too. That is just something you accept. The trick is trying to do this all together. If she could have sat there without whining and complaining while I read, we would both have had the time to do the stuff we needed or wanted to do.  Two bites into dinner and I was sick. I don't handle my own sauce too well. It was really tasty but my gastric bypass little pouch just hates it. I think it is the acidity. So I got stretched out on the couch until the pain passed, then cleaned up the kitchen.  I spend a lot of MY TIME kicking it on the bed. Either reading, talking to Larry, watching TV, whatever. It is comfortable and is probably just a substitute for the couch, but it does make me feel guilty and lazy.  While Kelsey and Larry went to the pool, I set up this blog and listened to Surya Das on tape. I watched Larry pack for our cruise. He has to start packing 10 days in advance... LOL. Al Roker's food nation was on, then off to snore a few hours away until the work thing started again.  So I am watching the clock, and paging through my two calendars. I have one for personal and one for work, but most of the events get cross logged so I always know what is going on. I have to know what I am doing for the next 3 or so weeks, and I will plan my days like Larry plans his cruise wardrobe.  Day off my time last weekend consisted of some gardening, Ferris Bueller on the tube, evenings in the spa, shopping for clothes because I have to rebuild the wardrobe I threw out. It takes a long time to replentish 10 years of fat clothes that get pitched in the course of a few months.  So, 45 minutes or so until lunch. Not sure which project I should work on now. I am emailing customers that have not paid us in a long time, I could work on a training program I am writing. I could look online for the wine cooler fridge thing I am getting Larry for his birthday... hey I know:  I think I will call my brother. I have not talked to him in a year or so and I could use a brawl!  Peace, J

      Here we go. I have been keeping an onine journal for over a year now. You can see it at  urlLink my WLS site . This blog promises to cover more topics but will keep my old friends up to date on my progress.  For my new friends: I am Julianna. On July 29, 2003 I had gastric bypass surgery. I have lost 150 lbs since then, and I am a happier, stronger person for it.  In the last year I have found so many new ways to enjoy my life, and so many things I want to express. This should make it easier than it has been. I have been posting to my website and ftp'ing my life away.  And we're off...
