      Now I don't think I have ever called him Chewy to his face. In fact I am not sure I remember how he got that name....something about back hair?  My friend Brian Jeanseau is the monthly Blog Star. I will be highlighting a new person in my life each month that inspires me, encourages me, or makes me laugh. This month's BS does all three.      Let's start with why Brian inspires me...  Brian is one of the most real people I have ever met. He is honest, forthright, and nice when doing it. Brian cares for his family. I think that is fantastic. He provides for his family, financially and I know he takes his wife on dates. I have observed him being an excellent husband and father.  Brian is encouraging. He recently took over as worship leader for our church and is doing a phenomenal job. I felt SO cared about the first week after worship he sent all of us an email informing us of how proud he was....so neat. He is always pushing me a little further than I want to go, and I truly feel he believes in me...I cannot say that about very many people.  Brian makes me laugh...mallard duck. Enough said.  I think Brian is one of the best people that I know and all of you should be lucky enough to have a friend like Brian.  Kat

      I have become a member of the "Check Fraudulence Club." No I have not started conterfeiting checks in the McVicker's basement(next to the Meth Lab...AKA "Brew Kitchen"). Yours truly had some checks that got into the hands of the devil's handy men(or women for that matter). Okay so I am kidding about the DH men...just need a little humor. I came home on Wednesday from a relaxing evening in the suburbs to find a letter from Winco Foods notifying me of a dishonored check. I thought that was weird since I have not shopped there in forever and I certainly did not spend $129. I mean come on...I don't think I have EVER spent that much on groceries..I am single...well maybe when I was a youth leader and all of those teenagers eating me out of house and home. Anyways I called the store and found out there was another check for $98...called the bank the next day to find out it is 6 checks thus far. Did I mention that this is on my closed account from WA? Yeah so I had to file a police report, they are sending me some stuff to sign, then as far as I know now I will have to take a police report to each place that this person wrote a check..needless to say I was hacked. I was more stressed than anything.  Tommorow I am teaching on Phil. 4:6-7  Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  Kinda funny the scripture that I have been studying for the last week and a half is perfectly applicable to my present life circumstances.  I have spent the last couple of days realizing how truly blessed I am, which leads me to being thankful. I have had a really shitty last year, but despite the ebb and flow of life I realize I always come out of it fine. I survive.   The God that is my very breathe, my very reason for living, is my strength. Father I thank thee.   I am thankful for relationships, love, truth. Father I thank thee.   Take time this week to be thankful for your existence, purpose, and His divine beauty shining on you.  Kat

        I watched the movie Grand Canyon last Sunday. I had not seen that movie in several years and was surprise by the poignant theme. I came away from that movie thinking/rethinking a lot of stuff in my own life as to how I am living and how that may/may not affect my world, my community.   Fast forward to Friday I am driving to work and I take a different route one that included me stopping by the yuppie Safeway(have you seen the ones with track lighting in the cheese/wine section?) for an energy bar before work. I decided to go up Cornell to 158th and drove by the large building I drive by on the 26 occasionally. I always looked closely at this building wondering what it was. They were obviously doing some sort of additions and thought it was perhaps a new college building or perhaps a high school, or a home for corporate offices of some sort. To my amazement it was a church. I saw the sign for a presbyterian church and was speechless. Now what I am about to write may seem judgemental...but I need to pose the question...why? I don't get it. I don't. Multi-million dollar(guessing...not really sure of the exact numbers) building projects when there are people with no food or clothes for people in the community. I just don't get the world today. I don't understand how we have a society in which the rich become richer and the poor become poorer. I was angry when I saw that it was a church. I am not trying to be a bleeding heart liberal but I feel something is severely wrong with this picture.   I was reading Blue like Jazz by Donald Miller again this week and he writes about problems. He states that the problem does not lie in the politics of the world, the church, but essentially the problem lies within us. He states that the only true change, true life-giving, God-honoring change would have to start with the individual. I whole-heartedly agree. It does begin with me.  When I have these moments of enlightenment I am jacked up and ready to make a change. I harbor these utopian ideas of evolving into a better person. I need to give more, consume less, live a life of simplicity. Give to the poor, I don't really need to buy make-up or shoes, I can give it away. I don't need to drive or buy products that are not good for the environment. I make list after list of all of the things I want to change about myself, my habits, only to be disappointed at my lack of discipline and follow-through. So I ask myself, how do I make changes in my life? Miller says that the path to joy winds through a dark valley of our own depravity.   I know that are times in my life when I have looked at my own crap and been so completely discouraged at my progress. I see who I am and all that I aspire to be and it makes me sad that I fall SO short of my expectations. The only thing redeemable thing about my life is the fact that as I may be overly critical of myself,God is not that way. In fact he is just proud of me that I get up and make the effort to live my life and want him to be apart of that. I think that things will really start to change not only in my own heart, but in the hearts of men and women in this world is when we see that we are a really screwed up people in need of someone to save us. Yes the problem is in me, but there is someone who wants to hold me, love me, and show me who I was intended to be without all of my self-absorption. In the light of that knowledge we CAN as Eugene Peterson says be made into our true selves, our child-of-God selves.  Peace   Kat

        Each year as my birthday comes and goes, I take a significant amount of time reflecting on the past, present, and what is to come. Periodically a sense of nostalgia comes over me as I smell a familiar scent or hear a song that takes me to another place. These moments lead me to recall old memories, some joyous, others despairing. Recently I has one of these occasions as I began to read past journal entries.   Journaling for me has become one of my most treasured activities. It is a place that I bear my soul, process through emotions, and pray. Most of it is prayer. I write these letters to God of my pain, fraility, and my lack of understanding the mystery. I pour out my love, gratitude, and desire...passionate letter after passionate letter.  In these letters I record not only my own voice but the voice of the One who weeps with me, laughs with me, and renews hope within my feeble heart.   When I was in middle school I had a diary. I was good about writing in it. It always felt funny to write my thoughts, activities, and emotions to "Diary". It was pointless to me. I remember at slumber parties we used to read each others diaries if we were "best friends"....only your BF could know the intimate details about you. I remember some of the things I used to read, " We went to the mall today," or "I really want a new phone,"...mine were always something about a boy. "I really wish Josh McDonald would be my boyfriend." Josh McDonald was my sixth grade crush who did not have a clue as to who I was until 7th grade when I became popular. Look back at those times, now at 26, I wish I would have kept those old pages. To be able to see the reality of middle school dating rearing it's ugly head again almost 15 years later would be humbling. Girls, I don't think we ever grow out of our girly middle school phase. We still ask each other info about what the boy said, we still get all stupid and googly, and we still think that the world would be complete if we just had "the boy." I'll try not to continue with this tangent and save it for the book. There is still something very sacred about the contents of a diary/journal that even only your closest friends are able to know your thoughts. Even with that said I only read exerpts from my journals to my most intimate friends...which consists of 2-3 people. And with that there is only one person who I would let hold the treasured contents and read it for themselves(you know who you are). It is a very very intimate thing.  Over almost 9 years I have written in everything from notebooks, cutesy journals from Old Navy, to napkins from coffee shops. I am somewhat of a minimalist so everything that is not being used is in the trash or on the way to the Goodwill...but never my old papers. There are moments, emotions, and journeys recorded in these books that would make an excellent made for T.V. movie. I read my earliest prayers and note that everything is flowery and pretty using big words like majesty, king of kings, and holy of holies. Over the years this was toned down as I grew in my relationship with God to words like my friend, my father, with the occasional king thrown in. Then there were the crying out for God years...that is where my pain began to seep into my view of God. My self-inflicted wounds causing me to to question whether or not he was there. My faith diminishing under the weight of disbelief, so I yelled, screamed, and cursed at God. He became at that point a comforter, lover, and a savior in a way I had not understood and still am trying to comprehend today.  Now I look back at my life over the last 10 years and I see that it is good. I struggle with my desire to be all that I aspire to be , yet all that He has created me to be...eventually I will grasp that these coincide. I see the person that I am becoming and it excites me. Not because of anything that I have achieved, but because I can see the miracle within me. I see the person I was, I am, and who I am becoming and I am awed by the work of his hand. Who ever thought he would take a snobby materialistic girl and change me into who I am being molded into?  I look over my relationships and am awed. I think back to years past and all of my friendships were somewhat superficial. This year brought some relationships to a close, but by the closing it brought a depth of love and understanding to some that lacked. It also brought the emotional availability to invest in new friendships. My friend Matt, who I would say is my best friend, has taught me new things that I never thought I could learn. We have fought over everything there is to fight over, disagreed on everything, and for a period of time could not stand each other. I have a greater understanding of fighting for people in relationships because he fought for me. He did not give up and now he is reaping the fruit of his hard labor...I am no longer a bitch(most of the time). I guess that is a miracle...he would say so. My friends Trissa, Julie, and Curtis have all had a hand in shaping me into the person that I am becoming. Entry after entry usually includes something that one of them has said to encourage, stimulate, or piss me off. It is so good.         These are pictures that were taken from my 26th birthday party. The picture with Trissa, Alicia, Matt and I, is my favorite. Allisha and Matt both helped out tons to get the party ready. They both know how stressed out I get at events that I am planning and so they were right there keeping me together. About an hour before the party Matt took over and finished getting things ready while I got dressed. Trissa and Jon arrived about a 1/2 hour later and Jon(who is not familiar with my pre-party stress) said, "Someone get this girl a drink." Trissa replied, "This is just how she is before the party. As soon as people begin to arrive she will be a completely different person...laughing, enjoying herself." She was right. It is so nice to have people in your life that know you so well. These relationships continue to go through trials and tribulations and each time we all learn a new meaning for words like love, forgiveness, understanding, and compassion. I am the person I am because of the people that play the part they are supposed to play in the symphony of life. Each instrument, each note being played, sometimes not harmonically, but after much practice and devotion...the music is played and flows into the beautiful melodies that are intimate relationships.   Peace  Kat
