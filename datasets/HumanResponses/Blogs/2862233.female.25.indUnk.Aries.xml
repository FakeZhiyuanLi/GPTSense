      "so, i went to this party last night, suppose to be fancy dress up and it wasn't. now i'm a little pissy. because rob lowe  wasn't there ." this bit of a ramble was brought to you by jay jay. but seriously folks. no fancy dress up at this cocktail party. oh, except for me.   i'm going on lockdown though, banned from booze and boys.  the combination of the two just doesn't make for a pretty annie.  actually, i was doing alright till i switched to beer towards the end of the night.  really, i probably shouldn't have had anything after the first three drinks.   so today is calming loungey oldies and no sudden movements.   i really can't believe that its so fricken' gorgeous out and i have to be in here again.  i can make it through though, just one more day and i have two, count them, two days off in a row!

       urlLink strangers with candy  was a brilliant tv series, i want amy sedaris to come over and bunny proof my house. of course, i don't have a bunny.   the new  urlLink liars  album comes on white vinyl... its very pretty, but i think i have to give it a few more spins before i know how i feel about it.  i'm on my way to the cocktail party, but i'm tired.   i really wanted to get a nap in before hand. doesn't it always seem that when you want to nap  you can't and when you're not trying to you fall right asleep? atleast thats how i am.   i'm on day 7 out of 9 in this continuous work week that is otherwise known as hell. not that i should really complain, it still doesn't add up to 40 hours. but just being there drains me.  today was extremely busy since it was the first nice day of the year, everyone and their mother wanted their hair done.  i've slacked on reading since i got igby in the mail.  milio wants me to read hemingways short stories,  i just wish that it wasn't hard back and as thick as a dictionary.  makes the task seem daunting and  school like.  okay, i guess i'm stalling.  i have mixed feelings about this night. it could go either really well, or completely south i think. i guess i won't know until i go over there though, huh?

      insanity seems to be the theme of today...  first on the train some random man with ice skates around his neck starts and an odd look on his face starts creeping towards me.  as we pull into the wellington stop, he runs up to my seat, grabs a newspaper that was under it and runs out the doors.  do i have to say that it freaked me out?! i jumped about a foot thinking, oh god he's going to  kill with ice skates!  the guy infront of me and asks if that was wierd...yeah it was wierd, it completely freaked me out!  besides that theres a women that keeps calling her for a free haircut and she is driving me nuts.  and to top the cake off, our extremely medicated ex-coworker is here babbling about how much she needs her hair done and going to pittsburg...  but thats a whole other story.  is it a full moon tonight? are these people drawn to me? what is going on here?

      "you say alot of funny things my little bunny,and i almost always laugh"  i highly recommend going to see a taping of  urlLink wait, wait... don't tell me !carl kassel is the cutest old man around. i laughed almost the entire taping. get your tickets now, because two of the three shows are sold out.   but now my eyes are blurring. i've been loading cds into my computer for atleast an hour,   so i can put them in my new IPOD! yes, igby is here and he has put a light in my heart that i could not dare dream of!   oh, excuse me. i guess i'm over doing it again. the software, itunes, isn't thrilling me so much though.  i think i need to read up more on it, but who has the patience for that? i almost didn't get the delivery today, because ups came to work before we opened. one the stylists had me call them and tell them to redeliver it since they know we're not there  until noon.  while i was on the phone he was completely obnoxious yelling stuff at them while i was trying to talk. kind of mortifying when you're more mature than someone whose twice your age.  alright, we've knocked out five straight days of working, only four more to go and i have a day off.  thats fine though, sara said we could go get drunk monday and tuesday is the yeah yeah yeahs...  oh, also, anyone want to go to a super fancy dress-up birthday cocktail party this weekend? there'll be cake!

      "how's annie? how's annie? how's annie? insert evil laugh"  alright, the insanity is almost over people. we watched the final episodes of twin peaks last night. just  urlLink fire walk with me  to contend with and you'll be  in the clear.  but, "in the meanwhile"  agent cooper falls in love with a girl named  urlLink annie ! how much do we like that? alot, until the end.  where it gets all fu*ked up ala david lynch!  its kind of a pattern with his stuff, you're completely wrapped up in it until the end where you end up scratching your head and thinking that's it?   i still recommend watching the  entire  series if you haven't already done so.  the whole household is going to get together and watch  fire walk with me  with a huge vat of coffee, donuts, and perhaps some pie!  you, of course are welcomed to join us.  just don't ask any questions, there's too much to explain!

      i think i dreamt of hedgehogs last night?  there are amazing people in this world. people with talent, creativity, modesty, completely unselfconscious and with genuine charisma. i'm always in awe of these people and feel privileged when i'm able to call them my friends. for this reason, i'll help promote any type of project that they are doing at the moment.   my friend steve is one of these people. i went to a play he's doing at  urlLink live bait theater  last night and  i must say that he was the best wigger that i have ever seen! so please go see it, the play is called i love the spirit world. it was written by  urlLink prof joe meno .  an all around good guy i must say. if you don't want to take my word for it, there was a review in the  urlLink reader .  speaking of amazing people,  urlLink david sedaris  has a short story in the march issue of gq.  yeah, it was magazine day at milios today!  and now i just have two more hours to get through before i get to go home.

      yeah, i'm bored, what of it?  life is mocking me, or maybe just one of my co-workers. i came into today to find little cardboard cut outs of the most coveted i-pod...  so as a testament to my devotion, i taped the green one to my sweater with the name igby written across it.  i will make it! i'm strong enough to get through this!  i switched belts with libby... i'm on the last hole on mine and it doesn't keep my pants up!  hers is awfully stiff though and i've had some good  times with mine so i don't think the trade is for keeps. hers does keep my pants up so thats a good quality in a belt.  speaking of prized possessions! i got my watch back, yeah! never in my life have so many people asked me what time it is than in the past few weeks that i've been watchless.   i've kind of been wondering if paul newman has a grandson about my age out there somewhere.  some research has only brought up a daughter who i'm pretty sure is gay. a couple other daughters are mentioned, they could have married and procreated, right?    okay, so maybe i've gone off the deep end with this one...

      lets hear it for sleepless nights...  except for when they're not sleepless in a good way.  i almost did it again last.  where you sleep for an hour or so and then wake up for the rest of the night.  its when i go and just have a few drinks, not drunk but not completely sober either.  then my mind starts to race... but i made myself stop somehow. i just kept thinking, nobodys losing sleep over me tonight so why should i lose sleep over them?

      i've found my soldier girl...she's so far away.   urlLink audrey horne  rocks my world!  more twin peaks for you!  so, she was completely hung up on agent cooper (as she should be, because, well there's just something about him), but a new man has come onto the  scene! john justin wheeler or jack played by mr billy zane! and is he smitten with her!   he's only been back in twin peaks for a couple of days and he's taken her on a  picnic, caught her from falling off a stage, and planted a big wet one on her!  if i was to be anyone in that show, it would be her. yes, i know the irony of  me complaining about boys living through the oc and me wanting to be audrey. but really, there is no comparison between the two situations because twin peaks is  the better show.  thats logic, and you can't argue with logic.   in i-pod news, the release date has been pushed back yet another week. i have my tax refund and its burning a hole in my bank account! guess i have to be strong and know  that it will worth it the end.  maybe the twin peaks is making me alittle over dramatic.

      it seems to be the trend that the people in my life are breaking up, or are very much  urlLink single . where as most of the people in sara's life, are getting MARRIED!  i'm trying to think of why that is and here is what i've come up with:  alot of her friends are from oregon... land of the hippies! not that there's anything wrong with that, but i think that by  nature, hippies want to settle down and make soap and care for their young and go to yoga classes and make their own baby food and clothes or something.  as a young urbanite, the idea of marriage at the same time intrigues me and sends me into convulsions.  when i hear that someone is getting married, i want to know all the stupid little details. what flowers are you having?, what kind of cake? where's it going to be?, what does your dress look like? blah blah blah.  when i think of myself getting married, i'm like a deer in  headlights. its not that i don't want to get married, or  haven't considered marrying someone in the past (briefly considered), its just that its FOREVER.  how do you know that this is the one person for you to spend the rest of your life with?   especially since a lot of people i know can't decide if they want to spend more than a few weeks with someone?

      i am finally seeing, i was the one worth leaving.  i know its annoying and quite loserish when pet owners discuss their "kids"...  but i haven't mentioned my cats yet so you'll have to grin and bear it! or scroll past it.  my cat (phooey) likes to hide behind the door that separates the front half of the apartment from the back half! then when sara's cat (ralphie) comes by, phooey attacks! hilarious! everytime i see phooey hiding back there it cracks me up!  that being said, we can move on.  i have episodes 20-24 of twin peaks on the premise as i am writing this. the problem is that nobody's home... i have no problem watching them by myself (we've already established that i have many a loser tendancies) but i think the other household members might be upset if i do so.  you can see my dilema here, right?  the last time this happened, i tried to sneak just one in... but you can't really stop at just one and then sara caught me!  i guess i should just go busy myself and wait, really whats the fun  in that though?

      the only thing wrong with you is that you're perfect....  the sun yesterday melted the snow from my heart.  no, i mean, from the streets.  people shouldn't discount that silly groundhog fellow, i think he may be right. atleast i hope so, i look forward to spring.   i'm very close to finishing the paint by numbers that i'm working on.  trying to complete  it quickly because the guy i work with who asked me to paint it has been cross tempered  with me lately.    today was my first visit to  urlLink trader joe's .  i must say that i was expecting more.  its on the small side and the deals that i was told so much about really weren't all that great.  the dangerous thing is that its right next door to  urlLink cb2 ... which calls to me with pretty red things in the windows!  did anyone else notice all the bands coming to chicago in march?  they all seem to be the week  before my birthday... hint: tickets make a great gift! plus then you get to come along, everyone wins!

      i can't get this out of my head...  a gym for the indie crowd.   i was at my ghetto womens gym today and the batteries ran out on my cd player about 3/4ths  through the pixies so i couldn't drown out the bad dance remixes.  the main qualms i have with my gym is that it plays horrible music, its far away, and that unless i go with someone i know there isn't anyone there i would want to talk to.  so a gym in the vacinity of east village/ukranian village/wicker park, that plays good music,(djs? live bands?) movies, has good yoga and dietary classes and such.  i know that there is punk rock aerobics on the east coast that is doing well. i think that this would be an awesome idea! as long as the membership was low cost, who  wouldn't want to join?   if only i had some investor!

      "the giant said that path is made by laying one stone at a time."  oh that  urlLink agent cooper ...  wait, in case you don't know what i'm talking about, the insanity has continued!  urlLink twin peaks  was on hiatus for abit but we've gained momentum again and theres no turning back now!  finished episodes 15-19 last night and it keeps getting better and better! david duchovny plays a cross dressing fbi agent!   which brings me to my next topic: running themes in my life as of late.  1.)  people who drink alot of coffee. even in twin peaks, coffee is like life blood to them. i drank a cup of expresso before work yesterday and felt really good till about 3pm when i suddenly needed to run to the deli and get some food or pass out. i know i should have started with something less strong than expresso, but it smelled so good  and sara was so proud of me when i said yes to a cup! the thing is that i enjoyed the act of drinking coffee, but i don't want to become addicted. which leads into...  2.) the idea of being addicted to something.  urlLink coffee ,  urlLink tv shows , buying  urlLink shoes (these are examples of others addictions, not my own. notice  urlLink paul newman  is not up there)... whatever the case maybe. there are certain things that people have weaknesses for and tend to categorize as addictions.   i know that it is plausible for people to become addicted to just about anything. but i think that  the word addiction may not always be the correct term in some situations.  i myself am exceptionally guilty of saying that i am addicted to things when in all reality i could stop whenever i want (no really i could!)  a friend of mine asked another friend of mine to share whatever it was that she was "addicted" to disaude me from egging her on about her "addiction". did you follow that? she thought that i might get on the other girls case about being obsessed with something and leave her alone.   so if you want to help her out, speak up and let me know your weakness. i'm probably not going to stop giving her crap though! carly i think you know what i'm talking about here?

      i'm officially obsessed!  i watched  urlLink cool hand luke  another one and a half times last night! yeah, one and a half... the half was because sara hadn't watched it  so i began to watch it again with her before bed.   my mantra in life right now is:  sometimes nothing is a real cool hand...  cause really i have nothing right now, but doesn't that mean that i'm completely open to possibities?  instead dwelling on the fact that i hate my job, school seemed to have been a complete waste of time, and i don't even want to even entertain a romantic thought i'm just going to enjoy the fact that i woke up early enough to have a cup of coffee in my sunny kitchen this morning.   so this is what i'm going to do... i'm going to look into some type of medical tech position that i can make some money at and have benefits, save money (which i'm actually pretty good at) and decide later on what to do.   so sometimes nothing is a real cool hand...  oh, and paul newman sexy.

      dull pain in my head all day, yes my own fault do to last nights anticts... but it was exactly what i needed, i think.   urlLink wait wait don't tell me  is doing a live taping in chicago, actually three of them. i would like to go to the soonest one on the 26th.  if anyone would care to join please let me know. i'll have to get the night off from work but it shouldn't be a problem.  also, there is a new joe meno play at the live bait theater that my friends steve and megan are it. i think that i'm going to it next sunday. it starts at 8pm.   work has been unbearably slow and i have two hours left still.  but i figured out how to add the sidebar links, so any day now they should appear on the page.  the other night i watched a pbs special about  urlLink tupperware  i know it sounds lame... but it was awesome.  brownie wise is now one of my newest heros. she took tupperware from a measly little product and made it into an empire.  truely one of the first powerful women in buisness and did she have some skills! except she should have had a better ending in life.  she owned nothing in the end while mr tupper divorced his wife, bought an island in the tropics and lived the rest of his life there. typical.  but i don't know why i love things that have to do with the kitchen so much. 24 years old and i have more  urlLink kitchen appliances  than my mother!  after our housewarming party, bernie was washing my punch bowl and it fell into the sink. nothing happened to it, but he said the look on my was as if he had killed my child! literally, my heart skipped a beat!  another example:the whole family of roommates went to the pilsen art walk on friday and what can we not stop talking about?  this piece of cake that we split at one of the galleries.  its hard to decribe, but the best name we could come up for it is milk cake.  when you bit into it, it was squishy as if it held milk in it.  so good, and i have to try and make one.  some of the art was good too.  alot of it was bad though.   there was a one piece that was collage matted between two panes of glass. it sort of gave a look of a cartoon cell. i liked that alot. sara liked these two painting that were in fifties pinks and greens of these fatter women one mastubating and the other holding a hose to her chest. there were rhinestones portraying the  various liquids. it was oddly compelling, i must admitt.  wow! i should end this now though because i've been at it (inbetween clients checking out and phone calls) for an hour now.  i can't get over how theraputic it is though to write down the minutia of everyday life!

      stand me up once, shame on you, stand me up  twice , shame on me!  what is with guys!  if you don't want to hang out with a girl anymore, TELL HER!  grow up. we are not fragil little creatures that are going to wither up and die because you decide that some little wierd thing has happened to make things what they aren't.  i'm sorry, but i have news for you: you are not in the oc!  you're life is never  going to be like the oc, and girls are not going to wait for you while you chase some fantasy hag and then decide that you don't want her, you want the one that was right infront of you all along.  i had such high hopes for the day, but i guess i should have known better. even my mom knows the score better than i do. she said to me today, annie, boys don't know what they want. and they say that girls are the ones who complicated, but  they're simple. its the boys who are complicated.  anyway, screw it all! its time to drink.

      so this is my first valentines day without tony............................................................................. i'm not going to lie and say that it isn't painful.  but i guess i just need to get through all of these firsts and then maybe i'll start to not hurt so much, or maybe not.  i shouldn't complain. afterall, isn't it better to have love and lost than to never have loved at all? for some reason i've been saying alot of cliches lately.  anyway, its hard to be the roommate without another person and to see pdas and hear about  everyones plans when i know exactly what i would be doing today if tony and i were still together.  but to everyone that i love, have a happy valentines day. i'll try to do my best even though i don't want to think about it.

      oh, i forgot! there needs to be more men in the world like paul newman.   back when paul newman was young that is. not that he isn't still pretty good looking and all.  but man, paul newman in cool hand luke! that's fu*king hot!    i always forget how much i adore that movie until someone brings it up or rents it!  it has some the best quotes ever.  for instance:  sometimes nothing is a pretty cool hand... i'm just standing in the rain talking to myself... love me, hate me, kill me, anything! just let me know that your there! and of course, what we have here is a failure to communicate...  so rent the movie, preferably on dvd because the theatrical trailer is surreal in itself.

      i had to wait for four busses before i finally was able to get on one! the third one didn't even open the doors! urrr!  you think with the raise in fares there would be an inkling of service improvement?  that pissed me off and so did the fact that my i-pod release date has been moved to the 20th!  alright, that is my venting for the moment.  now its time to warm up and get ready to go out there and tear it up people.  productivity is the key word for the week, alright?  of course i could be way more productive if i had an i-pod to provide me with a soundtrack!  kidding. not really, but yeah.

      okay, so that was a test of sorts and now i think i'm getting a foothold on this thing. the big news right now is that i just ordered one of  urlLink these   the green one!  yeah, i spent most of my tax refund on it, but its cute and i wanted it, alright!  i'm naming it after my friend joel who is the only one of us to actually make radio his full time job. but not after his real name, his radio name.  urlLink  Igby ... go to the airstaff section and you can see what he was born to do!  anyway, back to the i-pod. they aren't in the stores yet apparently (atleast that is what the woman at best buy finally told me after about fifteen minutes of her wasting my time) so i had to order it online and have it shipped to me.  what i really wanted to be doing right now was playing with my i-pod!   did that sound whiney? oh well.

      i need a vacation! i know, i just got back...  but the sleep deprivation is making me loopey i think.  amazing city that new york.  the bars, the people, the food...   i saw so many different neighborhoods with everything that you could imagine in each one.  central park on a sunday morning is brilliant. i wanted to be walking my dog with a cup of coffee in one hand and my i-pod playing.  a bartender from tokoyo at pianos hooked my i-pod up to the system and played air for us. a girl from helsinki bought me a shot.    manicures at a bar are fun, but get messed right away.   places stay open way past the time you would think anyone would be awake to go to them.  last call isn't till 5 in the morning! everywhere!  watch out though for the random yuppie bitch in pointy high heels  running down the street to steel your cab!  she came out of nowhere!  sitting in a resteraunt in little italy with the sun pouring through the  huge bay window we saw an old italian man straight out of a movie in the second floor window across the street.   every few moments he would lean out to  check out the action on the street.  there was another group of older gentlemen abit further up the same street sitting  in a circle talking in the middle of the sidewalk. nobody cared though.  you'll turn a corner and spot the cutest shop in the world right in the middle of nothing.  street venders sell the all the fake louie/prada/gouchie bags you could ever want (of course for me that is zero, but just the idea of being able to buy one on the street corner makes me smile)  happy hour is an actual thing, at bars you would want to go to. you get a token for free beers for each one that you get.   so i guess it sounds like i drank alot, but i didn't really.  yeah, so the consideration of moving there is growing by the hour. i think i'll see what pharmacy techs make there...

      you made me love you, i didn't want to do it, i didn't want to do it...  nyc, what can i say?  theres too much to put it all down right now.  but if i can pack that much into two days with mothers (anne's and mine,  such cute little troopers!) there,  i can't imagine what everyday life would be like.  well, i can sort of...  right now i'm exhausted. so i will go into details later suckas!  but aren't you happy i'm home?  well, atleast i know my cat is!

      urhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  i hate this. okay, i got a response.  he justified it all. hes going to buy a 3 flat. until then, his mom likes having him around. he never said he didn't want a committment. he enjoys her company. blah, blah, blah...  yeah, thats all well and good. but its still seems  to me that hes mocking everything that we went through.  i always said that we wouldn't be friends after the fact, but i thought it was cool when it seemed that wouldn't be the case. now i don't know.  maybe see you and have a nice life is what i need to do.  moving on,  i'm officially infatuated with ted leo.  amazing performer, so personable and darn cute! plus he can cover springstein and stiff little fingers in the same encore!

      i know i said i was going to leave it alone... but that's not my style.  yeah, i told him off. i said that hes basically reverted back into a teenager.  living in his parents basement,working for  his dad, driving an suv, dating a girl he met in high school? ugh!   he has so much potential, and thats what he's doing?  what happened to going to cooking school? or branching off into real graphic design work?  the whole reason we were moving into seperate places was because he said he had never lived on his own and he was getting older.  now look at him!  a new car payment will really help with your mortgage.  so hes going to become another loser suburbanite, get fat, bald, and content to take whatever comes his way.  he hasn't responded (or course it was via email) but i basically ripped him a new one.  yeah, i should have been the bigger person, but anger won out in the end.  can you really blame me?

      a fantastic word smith gave me this little metaphor for my going ons- i'm "the original smack, and she's the watered down version" the comparison being that studies found being in love is a chemical stimulant derived in the same part of the brain as drug addiction.   i had a good time tonight despite my exhaustion. it was a nice diversion and i didn't have to make anything besides deserts which is always a bonus!  in case your wondering, a key lime pie (with fresh squeezed key lime juice from about 40 tiny key limes, by hand mind you!) and a tres leche cake that is slowly but surely making its way to being somewhat authentic (i stupidly put in wheat flour instead of regular, damn! so close yet so far).  but everyone who came made me very happy and brought over good food and beverages! there really is something to this potluck dinner. they should happen more often time permitting.   i couldn't help myself and toward the end when everyone had left except for one special little bunny, i had sara pump her for info on the new trist in his life.  i was wrong about the highlights, its dark brown and long. she does live in the suburbs, blah! he knew her from high school, and she's so glad that she already knows all his friends and they like her so she doesn't have to worry about that and she doesn't have to meet any new people (please feel free to roll your eyes now). but she's skinny... he always did make me feel like i was kind of fat. i'm not fat, so much as i need some muscle tone.   well, lets not obsess over this. we'll see if he responds to my email (yes, another drunken email. a very simplistic one with only one question so don't look at me like that). and we will leave it at that.  its my first monday off! i get five weeks of them so that i can get to class on time.  i really am tuckered out... off to the land of nod for this alice in wonderland.

      "now i see love, looking at you from another girl's eyes"  how do i deal with this? i knew it was going to happen this way, but still it hurts so very much.  what do you do when the other person has moved on so very quickly and you still have to feel every emotion possible to a human being?  i think around the time he started seeing her, he told me there was no way he would be over me just like that. so why does it look like he was/is?  everyone has told me that its not him replacing me, but inside thats how it feels.  did all that time together mean nothing to him?  i know i wasn't the easiest person to date. i have a ton of issues... they just keep piling up even bigger now.   does he not even think of me anymore?    she probably gets along with his friends really well. she probably loves to be in the suburbs, and thinks its really cool to come to the city and go to john barleycorns. or dance at excaliber or some other lame night club. she probably wears jeans that have patterns faded  into them.  and has long blonde highlighted hair.  she listens to system of a down and other bad new metal/active rock. or bad pop music. or both. she doesn't know what makes a good tom collins, hell, shes never even drank a tom collins.she drinks shitty beer, but not because its cheap or pbr, because she doesn't know better. she wouldn't appreciate a good punk show (blink 182 is probably the closest she'd get to a punk show) and a good jazz bar all in the same night. she couldn't tell you the dialogue to high fidelity with the sound turned off. she shops at the gap. she wears clogs, or sketchers or ugly pointed toe shoes. she probably doesn't like flea markets, or baking, or documentaries, or polyphonic spree (she'd think they were some type of candy), or thrift stores, coffee drinks in special glasses, resteraunt supply stores, turtle lamps, vintage furniture, dia de la muerte, desmond dekker, tattoos (maybe a little butterfly somewhere, but thats it), dick dale, iron chef, records (especially colored vinyl, she didn't know that it could be any color but black), fairy tales, books about drug addicts (books in general), art galleries, lobster cookie cutters, the goonies, the ramones, small museums, red patent leather shoes, backgammon (she wouldn't know how to play), snoopy, fabric wearhouses, the las vegas that i know, sun kil moon, or marilyn monroe style bathing suits...   i don't know, i don't know.  now i haven't slept all night, my eyes are puffy, i have to go to work and have  people over at my house tonight when all i really want to do is hide from the entire world.   to top it all off, he didn't even have the decency to tell me. i even asked him point blank in a previous  (drunken) e-mail if he had dated anyone yet. but i had to find out from someone else.     i guess i was just deluding myself thinking that it was true when he said he would love me forever...

      ah man! my post was erased!   shit.  okay, had some food and now i can try this again... i got home from the gym not so long ago now. sara left me a note about seeing the  urlLink zombie movie  tonight, but i've already missed her! it sucks because i do want to see and all my die-hard scary movie friends will  probably see it tonight and then nobody will want to go with me.   near my ghetto gym is one of the best produce stores, harvest time. i highly recommend going to it if your in the vicinity of lawerence and rockwell. except the deli guy was staying stuff to me in spanish that i didn't quite catch, i know at one point he called me his love, ich. he was laughing about it because he thought i  didn't understand anything.  so i saw the last portion of  urlLink mates of state  last night.  what was cool was that nobody smoked because the keyboard player is pregnant.  upstairs, mike kinsella was spinning of his laptop/i-pod (not sure if that counts as spinning)... you know mike kinsella, from  urlLink joan of arc / urlLink owen / urlLink cap'n jazz / urlLink american football .  urlLink   whew!   only stayed for abit, but it was cool. joan of arc will be at the fireside apr 4th.  nyc is one week away.  so much to do in one week though! i hope i'm not all run down by the time it is to go.  oh, by the way, my mom traded her huge cadillac grandma car in for a little saab convertivable. crazy! when did she become so hip?

      i think that i felt the closest i will ever feel to being a minority last night. in my class there are 5 people from the phillipines (plus the teacher) 4 african americans, and me.  the teacher kept calling me andy instead of annie.  it should be cool though. there is a ton of stuff to memorize. and it sounds a bit like being a hairdresser because you have a certification test and that needs to be renued every two years with continuing education.  i learned the different classifications for all the highly addictive drugs though!

      ugh!!! i gained FIVE pounds!  i felt myself getting fatter and i still shoveled in the food. gross.  with that being said, i'm having a potluck dinner at my house on sunday.  i'm so broke and my trip to nyc is in less than two weeks. milio said once it gets closer to me leaving, he's cutting back my hours so that he can train someone new.  wouldn't i have to train the new person? wouldn't that entail me being here with that person? i'm not sure about that one. nobody here knows everything that i do with this job.  i thought he  would have me train the girl who is already here to sort of take over, but he makes it sound different.  i don't know, i guess i can't really worry about that now. i wish that he hadn't found out and i could have just told him later like i had planned.   i'm sitting here at work waiting for my color to process.  milio decided he needed to take me to lunch to calm me down (not that i needed calming down)  even though michael was only half way done with my hair. so now, michael has thrown the color on and i have to sit here while everyone else went to drink. once the color is done someone will come back and wash it for me so  i can go home. good times, good times.  my hair was in some desperate need of color.

      fire walk with me messes with your head. you think you have an idea of everything that happened in twin peaks, but you have no clue what really went down after the movie.  there was someone speaking on npr the other day about what makes a decent blog.  he said lots of links to other informative sites made for an interesting blog.  i guess i never really try to connect you to world,  i just like to babble on about whats going on in my life. probably not so interesting! but i'm sorry, this about me not you!  anyhoo, the whole reasoning behind having a man speak on npr about blogs was the political ramifications blogs could have.  in case you couldn't figure it out, my political stance: bush bad, anyone else good. over simplified, yes.  ideally, i would love if nader had even a prayer of winning. i know that he doesn't though  so there is no use in trying to vote for him. the election i did vote for him so that the green  party could gain funding.  it didn't make a difference in illinois anyway because cook county is  completely democratic which makes the entire state swing democrat. spain had that big bombing that brought in a socialist president. its sad that bush is trying to capitalize on 9/11 to get re-elected.   really, no matter what a politician says its probably not the truth. its what the public wants to hear.  i just hope that bush leaves and never ever returns to politics. maybe moves out of the country  altogether.  maybe dies in a plane crash on his way to moving out of the country altogether.   moving on, i like boys who tip people well. not over tipping, but a good 15-20% tip depending on how the service was.   just thought i'd throw that in there.

      i'm a pharmacist! not yet, but i registered for the class today and in five short weeks...pill pushing annie!  to sign up i needed proof that i graduated high school, thought this a good time to actually go down to columbia and pick up my diploma. yea,  its been about three  years since i graduated and i still hadn't picked it up. they give you a slinky when you pick  it up. Weird, huh? tuition dollars well spent.  know what i forgot about school? there are cute boys there. damn.  i think the idea of meeting cute boys at school is much more appealing than meeting them at bars.  since the school i'm taking the pharm tech class in isn't so much a real school as a technical  school (an odd one at that, more on it later) i doubt there will be any cute boys there.    another exciting thing today, i received mail!  not just any mail either, bloomers! i sent out a bloomer exchange letter and the first pair arrived today.  if all goes correctly, i'm supposed to get 36 pairs. but who knows if that will happen.  since i just had to buy one pair in the first place, i guess i'm even right now. hopefully i'll come out ahead in the end.  we're heading down to the pilsen art walk again this friday (can't believe its been a month already) so if you'd like to join us, let me know!  hey when i spell check, pharm comes up as porn.

      forget friendster, forget match.com, forget myspace, even forget your blog,  all i want to see is, drumroll please:  WWW.GIRLSWHOWANTTOMAKEOUT.COM  i know, i know, girls are supposed to only want the serious relationship. to tie down that one special guy and have that be the end of it all. blah! basically, i want a cute boy, decently intelligent, fun to hangout with, who i can  make-out with !  i'm asking for a world of trouble by posting this because i'm sure there are tons of  boys who see themselves fitting the description sending me some messages... but  really, i need a photo and some knowledge of you first. oh, and maybe you'd like to see what i look like too since you have no idea. but of course, i could be flattering myself.  after reading all my crazy rants maybe nobody who is reading this would want to make-out with me.   but this is where the website would kick in perfectly.  there are many of us out there. girls who for one reason or another (just got out of a relationship, haven't had one in awhile, know who they want to be with but aren't with yet or ever so need some play in the mean time) just want a warm body to make-out or go further with if the right course is taken. a bit classier than a bootie call i would say, but still basically a friend to fool around with is all we are asking for here.   what are your guys problems?!!!  is it egos that make you think we want you to be our living end?   i don't know.   maybe this is just a pipe dream like the indie rock gym, but i think that maybe, just maybe, www.girlswhowanttomakeout.com could be a reality.    ps yeah i saw boys who i want to make-out with tonight even though i was completely set on avoiding them. but that isn't the point.

      last night as i was getting ready for bed i thought, wow, its really cold, i wish i had a warm body to snuggle up against.   when i was getting situated under the covers my cat started to purr like he does in the morning to get under the covers and be a sweetheart! so i let him under only to have him leave about two seconds later.   which brings us to the running theme of my life lately, "just kidding, loser!"  wow, the weather is really nice. spring is here. nope. just kidding, loser. registering for my class is going to be easy and will be done quickly. just kidding, loser. i'm going to get hangout with my friend who always too busy. just kidding, loser.  i'm going to get to the gym today. just kidding, loser.  damn.   i hope the theme is short lived, but i have a feeling that as soon as i think its over it'll be  just kidding, loser!

      i wanted to sign up for the pharmacy tech class today, but communication was mixed up apparently. the lady told me today was the last day and that the school closed at 9pm. but saturday is the last day and they open at nine and close at 6. for some reason the very straight foward questions that i ask over the phone are never answered correctly?    i did catch the mailman the other day and ask him why all my mail is returned to sender.  he said he didn't know why, but he was infact doing that.  nice, huh?  so i spent today cleaning the front desk at work.  yes it was really bad. yes people have been telling me to do it for awhile.  yes it took milio telling me to do it for it to get done.  whats your point?

      fantastic! i'm not hungover! aren't you proud?  i am dead tired though. went out till 'bout 2 am and awoke shortly before 6 am with a huge bruise on my arse.  not from anything like that dirty birds.  i wiped out on this highly polished wood floor  in the most incredible apartment i have ever seen.  to lay eyes on this apartment would make you salivate and to sit on one of the couches would make you wish to be paralyzed.  but silly me decided it would be a good time to slide from one room to the other... lost control, landed back upper thigh, elbow,  face  on the floor and my cookie went flying across the room!  oh, but anyhoo, saw some good muszac  if you care to check out the  urlLink actually records  peoples.    apparently, i also had a fan in the audience that i was unaware of till that evening. since carly's  the only person who ever makes any comments i never really think of other people reading this thing.  got up at six to go the  urlLink flea market .  i found a sweet step stool/chair. its green, chrome, and old.  talked her down from 28 bucks to 18! bargain! how i love to haggle.  oh, also if you have time today i would recommend checking out  urlLink DEPART-ment  . small, but some cool artsy things that make you wanta make a sock monkey and sew something of your very own.  wow, see how productive you can be when you're not hungover or vomitting for other reasons.  the one thing i didn't do this weekend was see tony. se la vie. i guess thats the way it was supposed to go...

      i cleaned house today.  seriously, cleaned from about 11am to 5pm.  i meant to go out and enjoy the day abit as well, but it didn't happen.   so, i'm going to see tony tomorrow night for the first time since we broke up.  all these firsts are really odd...  i think it will be good. i miss him as a person. as a boyfriend too, but i'm going to do my best to look past that.  i'm certainly not trying to start anything back up again other than friendship, though i know some people aren't going to see it that way.   anyway, meg finally found out when and where she's going for the peacecorp. she's having people over tomorrow night and i didn't even know that she had invited tony till he e-mailed me today.   the group setting will be good, but he's giving me a ride from work to her house which may prove awkward.  i wish i could say i know what the hell i'm doing, but i don't. and as i said to someone the other night, advice just really doesn't work because i'm going to end up fucking whatever it is up in my own way anyway. everyone always does.

      " urlLink you make me wanta ooh,ooh,ooh, ahooh " damn i wish i had sex appeal! i mean the kind of sex appeal that makes boy/girls, straight/gay, whoever cry out your name!   the best i ever get is that i'm cute. not that theres anything wrong with that. but sometimes it would be cool to be thought of as having a raunchy sexy thing going.   in other wierd happenings while riding the cta... i looked at the bus window to see a man of short stature (little person if you will) walking pigeon toed down the street while muttering to himself and every few feet turning in a circle.   i got my belt fixed, the man knows his leather! knew exactly where i bought it, well it was apparently from his uncles old store that used to be underneath milios a few years back.  but he only charged three dollars to shorten it.  while i was waiting i found out that today was infact dr. suess' birthday!  so we should all read green eggs and ham before turning in for the night.

      happiness is a warm puppy!  if you happen to be on friendster, i have a picture of me with one of the stylists new pup. i named her lucielle, lucy for short. but he is thinking of changing it, really for no good reason!  oh, yeah, i guess it is his dog and all.  but it really does make you happy to hold a cute little fur ball in your arms!  i didn't watch the oscars last... i was busy downloading music for igby!  i did look at some of the dresses online though.  really, money does not buy style or taste. i know that they get lots of that stuff  for free as well, but really, sometimes you should just say no.  this is the last day of the longest work week  ever  !  am i looking forward to not walking up those stairs and into to this place tomorrrow? what do you think.

      what are the odds of witnessing two blind men running into each other the street? and then on the bus, watching a pair of deaf  women have a conversation about six seats away from each other? thats the good thing about sign language, you aren't disturbing anyone by having a conversation some distance apart. i was lucky enough to see both today. i did feel  bad for the blind men. i wonder if either of them knew the other was blind?  i was the customer that everyone hates today. i escorted sara to the rembrandt exhibit at the art institute this morning because she really wanted to  go and it was ending soon.  she was disappointed  in the lack of paintings, and i was indifferent due to the early hour and lack of coffee (i can't believe how easily i became hooked on the stuff. when i started writing this i never drank coffee in the morning.)  we stopped in au bon pain to look at the pastries, even though we had creme brulee for breakfast.  i decided  to make a salad from the salad bar for later on. when i got to the cashier, it rang up $10 for the salad  and a bottle of water!  i told her i didn't want it, could i just buy the water (which i also didn't really want at that point but felt obligated to buy).  so the manager voids it, but the cashier shoved the salad in my direction.   "you might as well take it, or we'll just throw it away"   so i made off with my eight dollar salad for free. it was good too.

      gosh, i've been boring lately. i don't know what my problem is.  seems like i don't have anything to  say to anyone.   mostly, i feel like drinking alcohol and eating (theres creme brulee in my fridge  that i made yesterday morning to  scratch the itch for using my kitchen torch!) i need to get back in the habit of waking up to npr i think!   but, anyway... is there anything you want to talk about? i guess you would put it on your own blog if there was.   you can ask me anything though. i'll promise to respond as honestly as  i possibly can!   but watch out, sometimes i've been known to be sneaky!

      B-O-R-E-D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   why do i have to be here on a sunday afternoon?    i subjected my poor roommate to a drunken conversation when he got home from work at about 3:30 in the morning. (i think after i rambled on in the  comments section of poor natalie's post) he was an awfully good sport about it!  don't really remember what i rambled on about. hopefully he was just so tired that he doesn't either! one more day with the little pup in the house. i think i'm going to miss her, but it will be nice to not have my cat so mad at me.  a little more time and they would have just coexisted with out any qualms.   sara said i'm boy crazy...its been weighing on my mind.  i notice cute boys, thats about it.  its been a long time since i was single.  i guess i'm not  really sure how to go about it.  i'll tell ya one thing, "what do you do  for a living" is a line i never, ever, will find appealing enough to make me want to talk to you.   anyway... did i mention that i'm bored? theres a flippin' cubs game today to make matters worse. god how i hate the cubs!  iron and wine countdown: 68 days

      there hasn't been as much drama involved with the dog as i thought there would be. which is certainly a good thing. phooey is jealous and won't sleep in the same room as lucy and i though.  took her out to intertown and rainbo last night. she got so much attention! i can't really blame people though, she's super flippin' cute. went to rainbo so that we could use the photobooth. definitely going to submit one of the pics for the 2005 calendar.  one of the guys working there practically insisted on  it and said he would make sure it made the cut.   lazy day today. the rain is making me sleepy. i can't believe its so late already. i accomplished nothing other than eating some amazing pancakes, taking a nap, and watching  urlLink medea .  so, um... do you like stuff?

      so... yeah...   the dog and cats...   don't get along so well...  i know, i know. what did i expect?   sometimes dogs and cats get along alright.  i think that phooey will be okay by the end of the visit. but, raphly, hes such an asshole!  he is just a mean little cat.   the dog is so adorable. i can carry her everywhere! everyone loves her and runs up to her!  she is much  better attention that i usually get.  usually, around this time of year when it starts to warm up i just get people gawking at my tattoos.   are they real? can i touch them? (or sometimes they just do anyway, what is my skin supposed to feel like? scales? i'm not  quite sure about the touching. i really don't  care for strangers touching me, but then, what must it  be like to be a dog that everyone wants to pet all the time?) okay, so i'm a little drunk. i haven't had anything to eat besides  a small piece of b-day cake for a girl i swear is not over the age of twenty (maybe 21, at the oldest) and  is married to stylist at  work (age, somewhere mid thirties) but i'm  not judging.  what was i talking about? oh, forget it. i'm going to make a  quesidilla!

      the puppy has landed! she's here. the cats are freaked out.  they'll get used to everything though.  they are so much bigger than her!  bought my ticket for iron and wine today!  yes, finally, hes going to be here!  well, in 72 days and counting.  jay jay rubbed my back for about two seconds today at work. god, i need a massage.  the  idea of breaking down and paying for something that i could usually pull off with a simple guilt trip  seems not so appealing though.  alright, more stories of integration of cats and dog  on the way...

      poop! no free air tickets which means that i am not going since i certainly don't have upwards of thirty dollars to spend on a single show.  oh well... so it goes lately.  this is the weekend that i get to take of my friend's dog! the one that is in my friendster picture.  its a trial of sorts because sara really wants a dog.  so if the cats don't  destroy it, and all goes well i guess maybe we can look at some shelters for a dog. maybe.   i'm not making any promises.  i really don't want the  house to become a barn or anything. it would have to be a really small dog.   and no, it wouldn't be overfed and get fat. and no my cat isn't fat either!  all you people need to stop judging him! hes just a big cat! tall really is the best word to describe him. hes kinda like a pony.   i've been in the movie rental mood for the past few days.  i think there are some documentaries i need to catch up on.  still haven't seen the eternal sunshine movie either, but it will happen eventually.   oh, one last thing... my class is over! before you know it i just may  have a grownup job.

      people sometimes run parallel to each other for awhile... its fun when they intersect.  one: a boy who i've seen on the bus a billion times before ends up standing next to/talking to a friend at the pinback show tonight.  he had never met said friend before, they just started to talk. it turns out the boy from the bus works with my roommate andrew.   two: a friend's roommate who i really never have had a chance  to speak to is at the bar and has also pretty done a 180 with her life. we end up talking for a good hour or so.  its odd to think about, but i was completely in a different path just six months ago.  in a relationship, willing to stay in radio and wait for a break that may or may not have come along, doing the same  thing day in and day out.   i may have thought that because everything that i was holding onto before is gone, that i'm not in a good place in my life.  but now that i think about it, i may not be completely in control of everything or know exactly what is going to happen from day to day, but why do i really want that?   i'm going to enjoy the company of my friends who are pretty amazing and i took for granted for so long.  i'm going to try not fret over the small things. i'm going to make myself happy, before i try to make someone else happy.

      since when does the fireside sell tickets in advance? will someone please tell me that!   oh, since they got a fancy new website. damn! why does the world have to modernize?  so tv on the radio, the show i've been looking forward to for awhile now is fricken SOLD OUT.  i keep missing the people i really want to see by a hair. i missed them the last time they were in town because i left for nyc that day, i missed architecture in helsinki by a day, and now this.   wtf? really.   oh, well, i guess i'll just go enjoy the beautiful night that chicago is lucky enough to be having instead of sitting in the stuffy, smoke filled, poorly  ventilated fireside bowl.   yes, i'm trying to make myself feel better. is it working? a little. :)

      will someone please cut my nose off of my face?  how do i so much stuff up there. its as if my brains first  expanded and now are melting out my nostrils.  atleast the sore throat has subsided.  we just took a walk around the block, its a beautifully still night in chicago. except for the two random cars that felt the need to honk at us (how is that getting you anywhere guys?  yeah, you honked. i looked. is there a bond formed? no.) it was relaxing.   i feel like i had something to say to you, but i forgot what it was.  so, love ya, goodnight.

      we apparently play this little game at home where bernie comes over sick and then sara gets sick and then i get sick... how it happens i'm not sure. andrew seems immune to it though. i'm sure spending three nights in a row in different smoked filled bars didn't help the cause.  i am a bit worried though, because i'm prone to strep throat. this  completely feels like the onset of it. which is the worse sickness in  the history of man. okay, not really by a long shot but it sucks a whole bunch!  spring is the time for shows! tv on the radio is friday, pinback on saturday, air on tuesday (think i scored free tix to that one! yes, radio connections , be  them few and far between, sometimes do pull through!). and then a client came in tonight and put up a poster for okkervil river on may 8th. and i'm wondering where my money is going...  i just really wish that iron and wine would head over this way instead of staying  on the west coast.   in other crazy news, my pharmacy tech class ends on monday. whew, it just sort  of flew by! so some of this weekend needs to be devoted to my final unfortunately.

      hope everyone had a good holiday, that is if you're into that sort of thing!  i had a very nice family filled weekend. the great thing about my family is how much they like to drink and play cards.  we have a cousin by marriage who is a fanatic picture taker, and she kept yelling at us to put our beer/wine/drink  down.  my internet is down once again. i'm hanging at the salon while my brother and his girlfriend get their hairs cut. so proud of alexis for cutting off twelve inches of  hair! we're donating it to wigs for kids.   alot went on this weekend, but i'll have to postpone the briefing alittle longer.  this whole internet working when it feels like is really sort of pissing me off. maybe i could only pay my bill when i feel like, or atleast only the part of it that i want to pay.

      before i started this whole blog thing, there was a joke article in the onion about some guy's mother finding his online journal. it was funny... until today when i saw milio had stumbled upon mine and was reading it.  dout!   the worst part is that i'm not sure if he just found it or has been reading it  for awhile. i guess that was the risk i took by posting at work, but he's so computer illiterate that i didn't think he would find. of course he could be reading this right now... in which case i mean oh, um, i don't really mind milio reading it all.  this weekend is going to be family packed. with not only my brother and his girlfriend coming into town, but my uncle, aunt, and two cousins from ny.  my uncle and aunt took us out to dinner at this amazing resteraunt on the top floor of a tall building near the  u.n. building while we were visiting. but for the most part he hasn't seen most of my  family in quite awhile. so there's all sorts of fun outings planned. most of my saturday is going to be taken up by it. then of course sunday is easter and my brother/alexis are staying at my place that night so they can leave the for the airport monday from the city.   this is my favorite part, alexis (my brothers girlfriend) e-mailed me that she wanted me to help her cut her hair this weekend. so, um, the only assistance i can give someone in getting their haircut is by setting up an appointment for them.  I DON'T CUT HAIR!    yes, i have seen tons of hair being cut, i've watched a thousand videos on it over and over again, heard many of conversations/lectures/classes about cutting hair, but have i physically picked up a pair of shears and tried to cut someone's hair? that is a big NO.   i'm going to try and talk her into going to the salon and letting someone do it for her/me. i think she mentioned that she already sort of jacked it, so professional is for sure the way to go.    well, wish me luck. hopefully i'll make it through unscathed this weekend. i'm sure it will feel awfully  long though.

      searching through igby this morning on the bus i noticed that most of the music in it is slower and bit depressing.  being that it is sunny and starting to warm up in chicago i think  i need to do alittle spring cleaning of my ipod and get some happy summer time music!  if you can think of anything, let me know.  apparently, everyone is having sinus problems right.   fortunate for me, i don't have any allergies.   well, work calls... the phones ringingn

      "secretly i want to bury in the yard, the great remains of our friendship scared."  so i'm drunk, not so much meaning to be as it just sort of happened. and at crobar of all places.  i knew though when i got in that cab that this would be the end result.    unfortunately its one of thouse sappy i'm a bit lonesome and depressed sort of drunks and not a happy go-lightly kind of drunks.  it makes me think of the past and what i had and all the random crazy things i've been doing in the last few months.  i just don't know what i'm doing with myself. i don't know if its the direction that i  want to be in. i'm unsure of everything.   i used to have something that i knew would be there. something secure and steady and loving. now i have doubt at every step of the way. and even that which i thought i knew so well seems to be an illusion.   why does this have to be this way? why can't things just fall into place and make sense? why can't i be audrey hepburn in some fantastic movie like breakfast at tiffanys or sabrina, or the one where she finds the fbi angent who discovers that the stamps is where the money was hidden, i can never remember the name of that one.   i want every word to have so much meaning that it hurts, but everything hurts anyway. i read someone saying that they fall in love everyday, well my heart breaks everyday.  and i find myself living by song lyrics...  sorry this is so depressing. its completely that quarter life crisis thing and i don't know what to do about it.   any suggestions?

      if you don't mind a bit of gore i recommend renting the movie  urlLink cabin fever ... the dialogue will have you cracking up!  and i got to hang out with steve for the first time in months! hes  one of the best people ever to watch a horror film with.   theres an art exhibit i recommend going to by heranandez de luna.  its homemade stamps that have crazy themes.  like pornagraphy and political misdoings. then he finds old envelopes with corresponding themes and mails them to himself.   i don't remember what the name of the gallery was but its at 118 n peoria. theres another gallery in the building that an aquaintance of mine helps out with called  urlLink three walls . its in the same building as the gallery  urlLink bodybuilder/sportsman . three walls was tiny but had some nice pieces in it. bodybuilder&sportsman was alright,  but not too exciting.   i was lucky enough to catch a phone call from megan last night. it will probably be the last time i get to talk to her (not including writing) in who knows how long. the time flew by as i knew it would. i'm going to miss her much.   speaking of time, did you remember to set your clocks foward? some of my co-workers  forgot (um, not to name names or anything jay jay, billy, brenna). as did a client who was very confused as to why when he thought he was fifteen minutes early we couldn't take him  (because he was in fact forty five minutes late)  i look forward to more sunlight and all but losing that hour of sleep was sad.

      "its hard to leave all these moments behind"  i'm not sure why things that i try to delete (like repeat postings that i put up because  i thought the first one didn't make it) still show up?  its strange how you can be determined to not like something and then find out that its not at all how you thought, and you like it. heres a list of things that i'm currently or not so far in the past come around on:  sushi the shins first album exercise grapefruit jeans that fit hip-hop (i still don't like going to the shows though) my i-pod earphones dancing  makeup soy sauce stir fry   well thats all i got for now.  okay, so i have to mention. it would have been five years today. sorry, thats all i'm going to say.

      "finding a replacement with a heart sedated, i'll forget you"  wait, what?   i'm not doing anything tonight? i don't have to study, go out, work till some odd hour. nothing!   is this a good thing or a bad thing?  not sure yet.  there was a time when i would say that i was complete loser if i had nothing to do  on a friday night, but now i'm kind of used to it. even maybe looking forward to it.   andrew just apologized because the rest of the household is off to the abbey to  blonde redhead which i forgot about and didn't get a ticket for. (i think he caught the part i wrote about being a loser, so now i'm getting pity! pity is no good for sure!)  i wish i knew where megan was so i could try and see her one last time before she leaves us for the republic of georgia...  i feel like i should have more to say, hummm.  oh! i got my mullet/pigtails cut off, finally. thats superficial though so i bid you a good night.

      singular forms sometimes repeated...  its always kind of weird when i come across someone who doesn't know that tony and i have broken up.  especially when its someone in my everyday life, like at work. then i have to go through it all again, when: november... why: we weren't getting along. what can you do, date forever? who: mutual, i think. how long were you together: it would have been five years saturday.  now of course there is the new twist. yeah, he's dating someone else.  my mother has a tendency to be brutally honest at times. when i told her about the breakup, she replied "so, you said you didn't want to marry him." when i told her he was already dating someone else i got, "good for him. he should move on."  i know that she's not trying to be hurtful. its just that she wants me to be independent and  not to just settle for settling's sake. basically, to do everything that she didn't.   its hard not to let your mother's expectations shape your life and i wonder if this had anything to  do with complete obstinance whenever anyone mentioned the notion of us getting married.   not that i'm trying to blame my mother for anything, things will turn out the way they're supposed to be. i'm just more of thinking outloud or on screen i guess.

      oh man!   atleast once a month my internet goes kaput and i my roommate andrew usually calls and in his very patient way  gets it resolved.  hes out of town, for a month. so sara was the poor person in line next to call the lovely people at sbc.   now, i know i should call, but i would lose my patience and  probably hang up on them.  what i would hope for is some free service, since if you add up all the time our internet hasn't worked it would equal atleast a month.  so i'm posting and catching up with everything while at work.  if i'm abit behind you'll have to forgive me! hopefully sbc  will get their heads out of their you know whats and get our internet fixed for good!  congrats to natalie for getting the most comments on my blog EVER! desserts and natalie, they bring people together...:)

      this one is for natalie,  who is bored at work (i know the feeling)  top ten desserts:  10.  pralines and creme ice cream  9.  my mother's peppermint cookies  8.  chocolate gelatto  7.  peanut butter shakes/malts  6.  bread pudding  5.  carrot cake with cream cheese frosting  4.  apple crisp with french vanilla ice cream  3.  flourless chocolate cake  2.  cheesecake, any variation of, but my favorite is to swirl chambord into the batter.  1.  creme brulee, newest favorite flavor is lemon.   hmmm, why do i always gain back any weight i lose?

      i'm a procrastinator.    always have been always will be. but not when it comes to little things that have no real significance. but to things that are important, ie paying bills, looking for a job, studying for tests, looking for an apartment/roommates.  this really isn't a good thing. i'm completely responsible and get all of it done (well, hopefully i find a job, since i only have a month) but sometimes it causes me more stress/money than it is actually worth.   such as having to move in with a friend for 3 weeks till i found roommates and an apartment that was right down the street from my old apartment. seriously, i moved from 853 to 817.   or figuring out that my ipod bill was due today not tomorrow and none of the "easy" online bill paying services would let me have payment go through for today. so instead of the $30 late fee, i paid a $15 service fee to pay over the phone with a check.  why do i do this to myself? as much as i would like to say i'll change, i know that i won't.

      some of my favorite things about summer  (if it would stay warm enough to feel like summer):  10. hearing kids play in the street  9.  taking walks and eating ice cream 8.  drinking outdoors (bar or home) 7.  bbq! 6.  wearing skirts 5.   urlLink flea markets  4.   urlLink some of chicago's many festivals  3.  picnics 2.  riding bikes  1.   urlLink movies in the park!   if you don't know about movies in the park, its the best thing ever! they set up a huge screen in the corner of grant park and every tuesday show a classic movie! the park gets packed so you have to go early or have someone stake out a spot for you. everyone brings food/wine (which you have to sort of hide since you're not supposed to drink in the park) and you watch this fantastic movie outdoors in the lawn.   so thats what we do in chicago, you should join us. or tell me about what you guys do in your neck of the woods.

      guys elude me.  of course it would help to know what i want from a guy in the first place.  but the flirty interaction/friends line is so easily crossed with guys that i'm not sure if i'm just giggling with a friend or i'm picking up on a hint.  and then there's the fact that i flip-flop daily on whether i want to do something as simple as go on a date. not that i've been asked, but you know the game you play in your head where you pretend someone has asked you?  then you figure out your response.   but i change my response each time, with the  same people.   well, according to my astrology chart someone read for me i'm not getting married till i turn forty! so i guess i have a ton of time to figure this out. not that i really believe in astrology.

      two of my favorite things are peanut butter and ice cream. put them together and i'm pretty much in heaven. a heaven where i gain a million pounds...  i'm at work right now. the pup is visiting.   i woke up with a headache and it hasn't gone away with food or coffee.  i've probably overslept this weekend. but what do i want to do when i get home? sleep. or read, i think i'll read. i really want to get through on the road so i can start middlesex.   this is boring right?  iron and wine:40 days

      i went to the new tumans for the second time tonight. its just so odd to see people watching basketball on plasma screen tvs in a bar that used to have a sagging pool table and kegs for chairs.  a decent beer is still pretty cheap though, so i guess i can't complain totally.  my cat is making a huge fuss right now, maybe that means its time to go to sleep.  bands that change sound from song to song confuse me. i keep trying to like  urlLink the wrens , but when it goes from slow ballad;alterna rock;dance rock,i want to say pick a general sound already! bands that try to sound good at everything just generally end up sounding mediocre at most things and at best just decent at the rest.

      "i wish i had stayed..."    i don't even know how to begin, i finally saw the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.  it definitely wins the award movie most likely to make it hard to breathe.  i swear there should be a disclaimer on it, if you've  gone through a painful breakup within x amount of time, don't watch under advisement of some national board of advisors.   but it poses a question(s), and if you haven't watched it don't read the question(s), but here it is:  if you lost someone you loved and every memory of each was erased from your minds, do you think that you would be  able to surpass the insurmountable odds and find each other again? and if you were able to do this amazing thing of starting anew, why couldn't you make it through the ordinary day to day? wouldn't you just come to the same point the second time around?  well, i need to sleep now.  take your time answering these for me if you need to. i'll understand.

      sometimes i forget how much i love a song...      or a singer until i hear them unknowingly. i adore  urlLink sun kil moon . its beautiful no matter when you listen to it. it just so happens that after i listen to iron and wine, sun kil moon happened to be checked off in i-tunes and played next. it didn't  seem right to me after first, i have had a bit of sangria and wine, but then when i double checked i realized how wonderful it truly is.  i wish i could produce something so simply lyrical and complicated  musically to make it just so absolutely pleasing. then again, i wish i could produce any type of music period.

      my niece turns 17 today! 17!   i remember when she was just born, she weighed about 4lbs.  she was  even tiny in my eight year old arms.  now she is as tall if not taller than me.   and no, i was never called aunt annie. i was too young for that sort of thing.

      the subject of time, or time is subjective.   do you remember when you were young and if something exciting ie birthday, xmas, start of summer break, was the next week? that week seemed to take forever!  every older person i knew would say: wait till you're our age, time rushes by.  it was another one of those things that i thought they just  were obligated to say, like wait till you're older, you'll like asparagus. now i do like asparagus, and time flys by.  time being a unit of measure, it should seem constant. but each person has almost seems to run on their own time. you may freak out if you're late for something, or think you've done well if you've shown up with 20 mins of when you were supposed to be there.  also, i think men and women have a complete different view on time.  if women say its only been a week, men will say its been atleast a month already. and if women say its been a week already! men will say its only been a couple of days, or whats the big deal, its only been a week?  not sure where i'm going with this. but feel free to weigh in.

      so here's the problem(s) with friendster:  its fricken slow. it emails you that you have messages, but doesn't show them in the inbox. or it doesn't email you when you have messages. it says you have no friends when you do. it doesn't let you look at stuff you  should be able to. and it all around just sucks!

      so there's good news and there's bad news. bad news first:  my pie didn't turn out, sad... i lost my atm card, sadder.  the pie, i didn't have the best working conditions. it called for a double boiler and my mom didn't even have a metal bowl that i could make into an adequate make-shift one. so the filling never thickened. it was  orange pie soup!  the atm card, my very own stupidity. i either a) left it in the atm or b) passed it out with the flyers i had to give out after the peaches show.  thankfully there hasn't been any activity on it and it is now canceled.  the good news: i've seen two good shows, some neat art, and the weekend isn't even over.  the stray had some really nice pieces, don't get me wrong it had a ton of crap too.  the thing is by the end of it you don't really want to look at anymore art, no matter how good it is. two major themes though: anti-bush and porn. ironic in a way.  peaches puts on a crazy show.  she's half dressed the entire time. she never stops dancing, there are half men/women  people who do her back up dancing. my favorite part was a duet with iggy pop, but his part was projected onto a white screen and she stood infront of it.  okkervil river, there is nothing as hot as boys who can play many a instrument, get seriously excited about their music, and just plain rock on top of the fact that they were hot before all those factors.  in the vein of neutral milk hotel, i recommend it.  i'm getting a bit worn out doing all this, but still look forward to  aloha tonight.    if you happen to be a mother, i don't know why you'd be reading this, but happy mother's day.    aloha!

      so... i'm going to try and fit all this in this weekend:   urlLink the stray show   urlLink peaches  visiting my parents/making a blood orange meringue pie okkervil river work aloha  i'm hoping nothing is going to have to get cut out, but  am afraid thats its going to be the stray show.  which i really want to check out, but don't know yet how to fit into the schedule. yeah, i was going to make my mom a carrot cake and then she said "surprise me" so i came up with the pie  instead. it sounds pretty good, but i'm going to have to get it done saturday morning before going up to the burbs.  crazy days, why does everything happen all at once?

      for once in a long time, my day off is a beautiful fricken' day! so why did/am i: sleep so late typing away at the computer planning on going to the gym?  i need to get my act together and start looking for a job!  which means updating/getting copies of the resume, and  going to drugstores.... where to start?  target of course! whats cooler that the target discount? the marshfield fields discount that comes along with it!   yes, i can pick my job choice based on discounts, so what?  though a jewel or dominiks discount is mighty tempting too.  really, all i want to do is go ride my bike for the first time.  count down continues: 58 days.  PS happy cinco de mayo everybody!

      i bought a bike! its pretty special. hot pink with a white seat  and white handle bar grips.  i found it at  urlLink working bikes cooperative .  this is the place you should go to if you  don't have a bike or a ton of money.  all the workers are volunteer and the bikes are donated.  so i'm thinking for a name, maybe molly? or andy after molly ringwald's character in pretty in pink. or perhaps one of the pink ladies names? not sure...

      pride parade i think unfortunately had gone down hill in the past few years...  it was fun but i think that mostly people  were competing for the  "new found" source  of consumers/money.  lots of advertising showing how gay friendly different companies were and the  floats just weren't as spectacular as they could have been.    all in all it was a nice day outside and a good distraction for my worried mind. but the job search  continues and i have to wake up extra early tomorrow to  send in the resumes that i didn't get to today.  so goodnight, sweet dreams  everyone. hope this finds you well.

      okay, so i'm sending out resumes to admin/clerical/receptionist jobs. and it makes me kind of wonder why i didn't just do that in the first place?   just because the pharmacy tech thing is becoming less and less appealing to me. but i'm still persuing it as well. i pretty much have to since i dropped money into it.   most likely i could have been out of milio's awhile ago. but now that i only have three weeks till i actually am, with nothing for certain lined up... lets just say i'm not sleeping so well.  sorry its been so depressing lately. hopefully things will brighten up soon.

      iron and wine, (yes him again) was on carson daly last night.  he played one of my favorite songs off the new album, naked as we come. but i had sit through an insufferable half hour of carson's horrible interviewing.  how did that man ever get that job? he asked the same questions about 3 times to the same guest. he stumbled over words and made irrelevant comments about his own life.   he was down right annoying actually. but it did make me look forward to the show coming up a little over two weeks now.  and believe me,  i need things to look forward to right now!

      there are some things in life that you will never live down.  i will, infact, never live down the fact that carly thought i hated her for the first year that we knew each other.  i'm stand-offish, to put it nicely, in many situations. defense mechanism? maybe. you wouldn't think it to look at me, but i guess i'm much more shy than i can come off at times.  this will lead me to not talk, or be overly sarcastic, rude at times even. it can be miss construed as hatred, judging, or indifference, when in all actuality its me getting my footing around you.  its not on purpose. and i guess if you don't really know me any other way than via the web you probably wouldn't find me the way you pictured.  but then again, i may not find you the way i pictured either, huh?

      scarier than being hit  by car or opening car door... hitting a squirrel!  i almost hit a squirrel on  the ride to work today. it stopped in the middle of the road. i veered  right to avoid it, it began to run that way because it had just come from that direction. i veered left then, it followed suit!  finally mr. squirrel made it across the street and everything was okay again.   and also just top of this evening's post, can i just tell you how completely thankful i am that i don't live in wrigleyville anymore!!!!  true, the wicker park/bucktown/ukranian village area is becoming more and more rampant with these meatheads, but wrigleyville is the epitome of the mindless yuppie haven.  i'm afraid that i may have to follow others lead and move further and further south. i'm just hoping to have one year where i don't have to move though!

      i'm selfish. i don't mean to be, but i am. i'm the baby in  the family, basically growing up as an only child since my  siblings are so much older than me.  i'm used to getting my way.  my parents last week came down for blues fest and at the last minute invited me to join them. i gruffed about it, hopped on the bike and met them for the spare  hour i had during the day that i really wanted to spend taking a nap.   all they wanted to do was to see me. but  it just seemed a waste of time since i had to leave to get ready for the plans i had  already made. then my dad just wants to buy me a beer, or ice cream or something and  i didn't want it. i just wanted to drink my water and not even really talk.   the subject of father's day comes up and i say i  have to work on sunday but if he wants i'll come to the burbs saturday. but  he has to work saturday. so i suggest dinner sunday night, which they take to mean i'll be cooking, but if i do that then dinner won't be till late. so my mom says "you  want your father to take you out to dinner for father's day?"   basically, i guess, yes.   don't get me wrong, i love my parents. but they have always known me to have some idea of what i  want to do. right now i just have no clue. and when they ask me these questions that i ask myself everyday i just don't what to say.  so i don't mean to be selfish. but i fully confess that i am and apologize. to my  family, friends, my cat, and to you.

      ugh... i hate this.  okay, slightly drunken post on its way.  and of course its about boys, because  thats what all my drunken communications  are about.  so, i semi-initiated something with a guy who i saw at the bar tonight. but i don't know if he realized that was my intention or not. it was weird. i don't like having to make all the moves, really, i don't. now i don't even want to call him.  then i found out the boy i've been hung up on for the past whatever months and didn't "want a commitment" now has a very cute, very skinny girlfriend. a hairdresser non the less.  blah.  and last but not least, the boy who made me  doubt my very steady, long term relationship told me tonight as he went the washroom and left me by myself to just make eyes at the all the guys. to look "strong and sexy and they  will all want you." i told him none of those  guys wanted me and he said "thats a lie and  you know it."   so why don't you want me asshole?  then he comes back, maps comes on and where two inches from each others faces, but its probably just because hes drunk.  seven months into being single and i'm already fed up three times over. i keep telling myself not to give a shit and to just concentrate on myself... and when i think i've gotten to that point where i could date again all this crap comes up.   really, what am i supposed to do? someone please give me some sort of direction in this fucking life cause i'm so confused!

      i gathered up the courage to talk to milio today about how long i actually have a job for.  my dad met a man who can get me into a  pharmacy once i get certified which is not till mid-july.  the girl he hired to replace me is  training till basically the beginning of july.  sooo... i asked tonight and i can stay on part time till the test.  this has its good and bad points. good point:  i don't really like my job so working less is a plus, i will have more time to study for the test, i can make sure that i have tues nights off for movies in the park.  bad points: one mainly, i will be broke!  but atleast i shouldn't be homeless due to not being able to pay rent.  hopefully...

      when i left the house this morning it was downpouring. which is not a phenomenon to chicago as of late. but it bummed me out because i wanted to ride my bike to work and instead i had to take the bus.  now it is so very sunny out. but i can't ride my bike home, because its already  there!   so i think i'll skip the gym, ride the stinking bus home and go for a bike ride. hopefully it will get me out of this funk i'm feeling right now.  of course it would be way cooler if i had a bike gang to run with!

      oh, i feel fat...  the girls who came to the clothing swap are sweethearts, really, they are.  but they are so skinny. i was skinny, i had lost weight after the breakup due to a fabulous diet of horrible flu/ depression. i've since gained it all back and though i exercise now i still just feel huge.  to make matters worse, this morning my  roommate was going through the left over clothes since she wasn't there last night. everything fit her perfectly.  whimper.

      ladies clothing swap tonight!  if you're in the vicinity and  free tonight, bring all the clothes over that you don't want.  whatever anyone doesn't take, we will have salvation army pick up...  what better way to spend an evening than hanging with girls, looking at clothes, eating some sweets and drinking?  the only thing is if you drink too much sometimes you end up with things that you would have never taken sober!

      i sent a carepackage to my friend in the peace corp the other day. she is in the republic of georgia.  it took blooming forever! first i grabbed an envelope that said domestic use only. i got to the front of the line, realized this and asked the lady which envelope i was supposed to use. since these were the only ones out.  so she gives me one, i fill out the addresses, again, and hand it back to her.   she puts it on the scale thing and goes, huh, looks like this envelope doesn't go there either.  by this time the cookies i had baked were starting to crumble to cookie bits. she goes searching for yet another envelope and comes back with a HUGE one.  at this point i say fine, whatever, give me the thing so i can fill it out, for the third time.  she makes me stand off to the side, i fill that out, plus a customs form. she finally weighs it and tells me the total is roughly 10 dollars. which isn't too bad, but still probably cost more than the adbusters, two letters, and small bag of cookies that i baked.  i swear, the post office is my least favorite place in the world!

      rain, rain,go away...  no seriously, go away! the midwest is flooded!  chicago is flooded! we don't want to see you  around here for atleast a week or two.  plus, your cramping my new  bike riding life-style!  completely unrelated but not from too long ago, my other favorite quote that  makes me scratch my head and go huh? this one is from last year, but it will always stick around. in line for the bathroom at rainbo club two girls infront of me, one turns to  other and says "i can't wait for the summer party season to begin." completely serious and straight faced.  summer   party  season.  sports, hunting, allergy, holiday, weather, these are all things i  equate to having a season. party? not so much. you could have a party  anytime really. but does she go  to so many parties that she has to  break it into seasons?    hmmm...

      why am i awake?     no call for me being up at 6:15 in the morning. the power went out at milio's yesterday about an hour after i started work.  milios is in an old brick building, on the second floor, with huge windows that look out over a  busy street but don't open. it was hot as bloody  hell in there about thirty seconds after the power went out.  this woman came in all pissed off because  "she had a photoshoot that night" first off, she was uglerly, second, her appointment was for a blowdry/style. we had no power, which means no blowdryers stupid!* *her, not you. stupid i mean.   the man who came in right behind her and who was standing at the desk when i told her that i was serious about not taking anymore clients for the night looked completely baffled when i explained to him that included him for a haircut.  so, milio bought a keg (actually earlier in the day when the power briefly went off for the first time). then we went to the bar across the street, and finally to a co-workers house to finish the keg. oh wait,  and then to another co-workers house to drink more.  lets just say i'm not feeling so pretty right now. so why am i awake?

      "if it weren't for my horse, i wouldn't have spent that year in college."  you ever hear something so stupid you just can't even begin to fathom what that person was thinking?    do you know louis black? the comedian from the daily show? my favorite line from him is "if it weren't for my horse i wouldn't have spent that year in college."  he heard someone say this and didn't find out why the meaning behind it.   tonight i heard on the train "that is why korn will always be my beatles"  korn? korn? you're saying that korn is going to always be your beatles? the beatles? paul, john, george and ringo? you're comparing korn to the beatles? what?   how can you even...?    lets not think about that too hard, or as louis black would say "blood will burst out of your eyes!"  i think i've decided what i'd like to go back to school for. to not completely waste my four years  at columbia and many radio internships completely i've come to sort of decide on broadcast law. i know, i haven't even started the pharmacy thing yet, but i already know that that is a temporary thing to get me through my stage in school.   so what do we think? i'd have to get a lot of suits and/or three quarter sleeve shirts though!  one last thing, i forgot a movie on my list, bubba ho-tep. with bruce campbell of evil dead fame. see it. its funny!

      i've been on a movie bender,    in the past week and a half (give or take a couple of days) i've  watched:  the virgin suicides (the second and third times)  urlLink coffee and cigarettes   urlLink triplets of bellville   urlLink the eye   urlLink capturing the friedmans   the thing is that i haven't been into anything that i've picked up to read lately.  i have about 30 pages in on the road left and i read the first page to middlesex, but nothings grabbing me.   big pet peeve: don't interrupt me on the phone. if i'm booking your appointment and you ask a question,  let me answer it before you ask the next one. or if you just listen to me, i'll probably answer your question anyway.  okay, enough ranting for me.

      try this one on for size...   my ex brings his new "girlfriend" to see our friend's (though he is really mostly my friend) band play.  apparently one of my friends asked him (not knowing that we haven't spoken in awhile) where i was infront of the chick. she gets mad and stomps off.  really, wtf?  why would you bring your new girlfriend to meet your ex-girlfriend's friends? and to a place where there is a  likely chance that you will run into your ex-girlfriend? especially when i've told him i just don't want to see/speak to him for a LONG time?    and what was the new girl expecting? none of my friends to mention my name when for the past four years whenever they saw him it was in my company? what if i had been there? what would she have done then?   to top it all my friend said that she was acting really flirty towards him and didn't even realize that was his girlfriend?  is it just me or does the entire act reek of pure stupidity?  oh, and thanks for the nickels derek. i think i'll have them changed to quarters to play pinball with though.

      i would recommend checking out     urlLink the zincs , worth a listen alone just for the singers very cool british accent. plus the music is good.  i have less than a month to find a new job. little anxious to say the least.  yet i haven't been good about the search. plus, my national certification test is mid-july. i have to study for that or i've wasted 120 bucks.  but its summer! theres cool stuff going on. i don't want to study/look for a job :( and i have no money.  so if you know anyone who needs a pharmacy tech, send them my way!

      hello to all those who might be reading this because of this  urlLink guy ...   i asked him to take the link off, but instead he took down his brief synopsis  of me and added the little quip you will now  find there.  i wouldn't mind the link if he a) had made it known he was reading b) asked me c) got the details straight in his first review.   also, for those new to the scene, i work at milio's. the conversation at the top of his page is not with me. if it had been, i would have at that time informed him that milio has a policy that the salon be closed on all bbqing holidays.   so if you become an avid reader, please let yourself  be known. if you want to direct people my way, just ask. more than likely i will reciprocate the favor.   thank you for your interest.   and derek, i still want the five dollars.

       okay, so my mom is picking     me up today and i won't be      back till the weekend sometime,     either sat or sun.       so instead of me just having nothing     really positive to post being the      case of my non-blogging, it will     be me out in the suburbs-     which is both comforting and      excoriating at the same time.        i won't be anywhere near the internet,     which considering how boring     the suburbs can be, is horrifying!       so i'll have to catch up with everyone later!       have a good rest of the week and wish     me luck!

       i'm going to visit the    parental units for a few days.     it'll be nice, since its the only   trip i can really afford to take!   really, its only about an hour north   of the city, but its still getting to   view some cable tv, eat other   people's food, and spend time with   my moms and hopefully niece.     so i leave tomorrow, cause i wanted   to be around today to  watch the movie   in the park. even though its mr. smith   goes to washington (maybe i was too    young to appreciate it when i saw it the    first time, but boring!) hopefully it    won't rain on us like last week.     i've been loving this autumn like    weather that that we are having though!   its great thats it not hot and sticky out   there.     perfect bike riding weather!

        you ever try to do to    much and then actually end up    doing nothing?      that is kinda how my night is    going. i still have the option    of jumping on my bike and heading    down to millennium park to meet     up with friends once they decide    to finally go (i think the park    closes at some point though, how    much time would we really have     considering its almost 11?)...    or i could be in humbolt park    playing kick ball...    or i could take the hour     train/bus ride to a pirate party.    but i'm at home...      the urge to just call the ex     (using the anonymous option of course)    is kind of strong. i just sort    of want to hear his voice. stupid, huh?      well, i've been going through books    like nobody's business. i'll     probably be finishing the     secret life of bees tonight.      yeah, sorry, that's all i got.    no wonder i haven't been posting!

       we spent the night getting  rained on in the park and   watching the birds...    crazy how many people stuck around  even after the rain  started and   stopped about four seperate times.    glad to say that we we're troopers as  well. but now i feel really gross and am  going to climb into bed instead of   going out to get loaded to celebrate my  unemployment.     oh yeah, i'm unemployed too! but don't   worry the government has got my back.

       i went to  a friend's house  for dinner last night, and   we ended up playing drinking  jenga.     they wrote things on the blocks  and whatever block you pulled   you had to do. such as chug, sing,  dance, or play i never...  there were alot of i never blocks.    but i thought that it would  be fun to do an i never blog style.  so i'll start, you don't have to drink...  but you do have to post something that  you never did, then when everyone has   posted theirs, you have to fess up to   the ones you've done... okay?    so, i never have had sex with more than   one person at a time.

       wow! they keep changing  blogger.     font sizes and types?  cra zy!    well, i'm sorry that  i haven't been writing.  the dog is driving me nuts.  milio offered me a grand 12 hrs  a week until i find a job.    i think this is because someone  told him he was going to have  to pay me unemployment. now   i guess if i don't take the  the hours, it looks like i've  quit? i don't, i have to call  unemployment.    take the pharm tech test tomorrow.  so fed up with it though,   that i haven't really studied.    god damn! somebody tell me what  the hell i'm doing?!     blahhh!!!

      i applied for an office position at a toy company.  they called and conducted a  "phone interview" with me this morning. blah.  so the end of it was, if you're interested  you can give us a call back, otherwise we'll be calling you.  i'm guessing this means no?  wtf, really? what do they  expect from you when they  catch you off guard like that? i mean i tried to display  some grace under fire, but they have to realize that its atleast little off setting, right?

      i'm dogsitting again. for some reason though, she seems whinier than  she was the last time.  her owner insisted that she  would have to sleep with me, everytime someone passed by  my door (the bathroom is right across the hall) she would bark. infuriating.  it makes me appreciate my cat so much more.  she is cute to take on  walks though. but i would never actually want to own her or any other dog i think.  last week on the payroll. lets hope unemployment takes my side.

      i went to a bachelorette party last night.  not only that i made penis shaped cookies for it (erotic baking, a whole new world for  me natalie!)  but there was a stripper. it was kind of gross actually. he did all this bump and grind  stuff. he had us play this game where he shoved a lollipop in  his thong and if you gave him a tip, you could tell him who had to pull it out with their teeth!  yeah, they made me get one.  then there were body shots. it just wasn't appealing though. i thankfully wasn't made to do  the body shots.   but it was fun. in the cab on the way to another bar the  bride was drunkenly talking  about how she was marrying the best man in the world. that though he was short in stature, he  was the tallest man you'd ever see. it was really sweet and yes  selfishly depressing at the same time.

       i went for tapas with a few friends on sunday.  there was a table of people from spain next to us.  the one man asked if we could take their picture (for some reason about the  fifth time it had happened that day).  then he started talking to us, asking where were from, if the girl sitting next to me was my sister, he thought we looked english for some reason!  then he was speaking in spanish to the rest of the table. the younger girl across from him mentioned she liked my tattoo. i smiled, said thank you. then the man explained to us that he had just told them he wanted to kiss my tattoo, starting at the bottom (at the elbow) and going up to my shoulder (he made the kissie noises and the motion of moving up my arm)!  needless to say, i was sort of in shock, covered my mouth and sort of laughed! everyone else at the table also sort of laughed nervously. the man was certainly not attractive and much older than me.  thank goodness it was at the end of the meal and we left shortly thereafter! but as we got outside, i busted out laughing and all anyone could say was "you sure are getting alot comments on your tattoo today"

       turning 30/moving away/weddings:  last night i stopped by a going away party for a couple who are moving to boston...  afterwards i went to a party for a girl who turned 30 (sadly there were more people at the going away party than the b-day)...  about a half dozen people i know were at weddings yesterday...  and on wed night i went to a going away get together for a different couple moving to d.c. (note  urlLink carly's  post on the subject!)  so all of these people are having major things happen in their lives.  and i can't help but think, why the f*ck can't i seem to get my life together?  p.s. i realize turning 30 isn't really getting anything accomplished.

       summer reading list...  i'm such a nerd. all i do is read and look at the classifieds!  well, not entirely true. i went on a nice bike ride yesterday to humboldt park. surprising pretty and certainly huge, i was always a bit scared to go there since the area tends to be sketchy.  but the reading is true. i've read: middlesex wicked secret life of bees divinci code a heartbreaking work of staggering genius and am now on the new sedaris.  its good to catch up on all this literature that i probably should have already read by now, but i'm getting sort of cabin fever at times!  so if anyone wants to go for a bike ride, walk, make some food, catch a cheap movie, whatever! i'm up for it and i have all the time (not so much the money) in the world!

       the asshole guy i interviewed for who i compared to office space called last night... he said he was returning my call. MY call? i didn't/wouldn't ever call that man again.  i told him that i hadn't called , i had interviewed awhile back and he offered me a telemarketing position that i was not interested in.  he then proceeds to tell me that there is still an office position available and i should fax my resume over to him again.  yeah, right buddy.  i took the number just so i could get him off the phone. another weird thing, it was at about 8:30 at night. does this man have no life what so ever?

      i know they mean well, but they are exasperating.  well, mainly my father.  he's a horrible driver (accelerates before braking, or just doesn't pay attention and then stops short),  he watches the tv ten times the volume it should be, same with listening to music in the car,  tries to hold a conversation with you when you're trying to read a book,  and mumbles constantly when hes not saying "WHAT?" to everything you say, whether what you're saying is addressed to him or not.  otherwise, my visit was pleasant.      went to the zoo with my mom.       went shopping with my niece for clothes for her  senior   pictures!     got my mom to buy/ride a bike!     watched  edwards/kerry's speeches.       cooked seafood risotto, and grilled peppers for my parents.     showed my mom some killer backgammon moves.       taught my mother the joys of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.       my mom taught me how to sew, whether i can do it on my own or not is still to be seen.     shopped at the flea market and found some good deals.      but on a side note, there are two boys who i thought were my friends who have been acting strange. not writing me back and doing weird friendster ignoring/deleting of testimonials. if either happens to be reading this, i'm under enough stress with being  unemployed  to be worrying about what i did/n't do to deserve such treatment.  whatever it was, please get over it and talk to me! for pete's sake!
