        Ah, I just don't know what to do... My best friend is having a tough time and I have no idea what to do. I just feel really shitty because she says no one understands or wants to help or tries... But what she doesn't know is that I do. When I see entries like that or away messages or just knowing that she doesn't feel good because stuff is going on, I want to help. Most of the time I ask her how she is and she just says ok, or fine, then goes away for a while, so I get the idea that she doesn't want to talk about it and I don't want to pester her or make her talk about it, so I just leave her a message saying I hope you feel better or something like that. I don't want to force her, but when she writes stuff like that, I feel like I did something wrong and I don't feel like a friend... I don't know if I'm one of the ones that these things are directed towards, but ahh... I don't know what to do because I hold everything in... Ahh...      Anyway, this is my favorite part of a song that I've been listening to a lot of lately:       Your words give me the oxygen to breathe...      It's a song by Farewell To Arms... They're awesome... Well, I'm gonna go, so cya...

      Not doing anything today. I've been pretty bored this summer. Sophmore year sucked so much. Too much shit went on... This guy that was a great friend of mine turned out to be an ass... Parents decided to go through my room and found my notebooks. They were extremely upset and wanted to get me "help" but I didn't want it. I don't really think I need it. Those notebooks were just for me to vent and write how I felt. I don't like going to people with my problems or telling them how I feel. They have enough going on and I don't want to bother them. Sometimes I can't handle it though. When they come to me with their problems, I seem to take them on as my own and it adds to everything and builds up. It's all I seem to think about. I can't sit by myself for a long time because they flood my mind. I just try to help them and forget about myself. My friends are more important... Just sometimes I don't get it. When I finally talk to someone about how I feel, it's like they don't care... They're like, "Oh... I'm sorry, but blah blah my problems my problems, your problems can wait." That's what it seems like sometimes. Maybe I'm overreacting. I probably am... I just needed those notebooks but now they're gone and my parents won't let me get another one. They won't find this, so I figured hey, why not? The whole guy thing is complicated. We became really close friends and I started to really like him. One day, I told him...and it turned out that he felt the same way. It was probably the first time that year where I was extremely happy. I had someone who liked me. I know, I'm such a  dork ... Everything was going great, but about a month later, he told me that he didn't feel the same way anymore... I was crushed, but held it in. I told him that it was ok and that I'd get over it... But the truth is, I haven't... I played it off like I was fine because I didn't want sympathy from him. I didn't want to look stupid... But after that we were still good friends. My friends told me that it seemed like he led me on so I was sort of pissed... He said he was sorry if he did, but he didn't think it did... Ah, I didn't know, I was so confused, like I  still  am... A while after that whole thing, he just stopped walking with me and talking to me... It hurts because I don't know what I did wrong. I ended up losing one of my best friends not knowing how. It's been about 4 months and we don't talk anymore. It sucks but I don't think there's anything I can do. Ah, sorry to anyone who is reading this... I keep babbling on and on... Ok, to my summer... We got a kitten. She's so cute but a pain heh... On Saturday, my friend and I went to see the fireworks in New London. They were awesome and we had some interesting convos haha. Well, I don't want to bore you anymore than I just did soo I'll write back soon. Cya...
