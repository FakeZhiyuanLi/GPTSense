       It was such a nice day outside (for once!) that I just had to spend it all in the sun...so I took the dog for a nice long walk and went swimming and lazed about in the sun, it was wonderful! I feel so relaxed and nice now.      Oh, and I got my mug that I had painted at Color Me Mine today, it looks so much better than I thought it would!! The lady there said it looked awesome, it made me feel so good, I'm so happy right now.

       I feel like I've changed a great deal...like I've become some strange and annoying person that no one really wants to be around, but somewhat forces themselves to put up with.  I don't know why I feel like this...I just do.      Anyway, my parents let me stay home alone (as in without supervision) overnight for the first time, my mom said she always knew I'd be fine, but *she* worries about me a lot, and wasn't sure if she could handle it...she wasn't sure if my grandma would approve, so I told her to go through with it, and then tell her after it's already been done.  I suppose it *is* a little underhanded, but the last thing I want is for my grandma to worry.      I borrowed Lys' Final Fantasy VIII so I could finish the game, but my playstation isn't letting me play it...it's really starting to get on my nerves.      I'm going to see Norah Jones in concert on the 30th...I can't wait.  Oh, and my elementary school reunion is the 28th, I really want to see all my old friends, so I'm excited for it.

       I was supposed to go to the Great Escape with my friend today, since the weather's not too bad...it looks like it's trying to clear up... But I haven't heard from here, so I don't know what the plan is. I wish I knew.  I might be spending part of the weekend in Saratoga up at my uncle's carriage house and maybe go into town or something, I was told I could bring a friend, but if I don't hear from her, I guess I could always find someone else.      I still miss the boat like hell, I had a dream where I had to climb the shrouds but pretty much fell...but I landed safely. I just remember we sang songs or something...I've had a couple of dreams about the Lettie...maybe one every night.

       I got my two of my favorite ice cream flavors for dessert today~ Strawberry and french vanilla with oreos and chocolate chips :3 it was quite possibly one of the best cones of ice cream I've ever had to date.      Anyway, I bought the Jason Mraz CD and some new headphones and had some chicken with my family for dinner since my aunt and uncle and cousin came up to ask me about my sailing trip.      Umm...that's pretty much it. I didn't really do anything today, I just took some pictures of my backyard, went out to dinner, and watched my cousin, Jon play Medal of Honor.      I've been feeling really pathetic lately...I can be so hopeless sometimes...but when Igor said I was a very romantic person, that made me feel a lot better, not as completely sad.

       This is a recent picture of me in my backyard. I straightened my hair and stuff so I look a little different.     urlLink A recent picture of me

       I'm boatsick...      Everyone keeps asking me about how sailing was, and I keep telling them how amazing it was, but it just makes me miss all my friends and the crew even more...every Ani song I sing with reminds me of Cory and Tiffany...And all the adventure and excitement was so much more fun than sitting around getting fat and watching the day go by.      All I did was go for a walk yesterday...I figured it was a rare nice day, I might as well enjoy it.      I miss working at 7 in the morning, and I miss calling back orders and feeling like I was a true pirate...I miss the cooking and the sound of the waves and the sun beating down on my face...I miss everything.      I just wish my adventure wasn't over.      Hal Sparks is on the Wayne Brady show! I love Hal Sparks sooo much!

       So I was in this incredibly good mood yesterday...I was really happy and excited and just plain ecstatic. And then I went to go to bed and I got to thinking about things and my mood just went downhill. I hate how I always overthink everything...it sucks.      Anyway, I still have a lot of work I have to do for school, but I don't really feel like doing any of it, since I don't care if I'm prepared for class or not anymore.

       I have like, 36 blogs, I swear...I'm not sure if I'm going to end up updating this one, but there's a good chance that I might...the one I update all the time is   urlLink  here  .  Anyway, I've pretty much had nothing to do since I got off the boat, but yesterday I made a big coffee mug (that's grey, but shh, I'm sure it'll come out fine.) and ate ice cream at the new ice cream place at Stuvesant Plaza...umm they have cake batter ice cream! Anyway...I don't really have much else to update on...I'm not very interesting...so maybe I'll post more later.
