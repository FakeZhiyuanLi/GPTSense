      Today is SYFOC.. woah.. so many ppl man.. got problem settling them into places.. lucky those teachers nv GL wif me.. haahaa.. but GL wif my friend.. CMI.. when we had settled everyone into their seats, there came another sch.. but everything is in control.. although it is seriouly hard work but we find the fun in it.. we fellow mates always fing fun out of everything.. then got 1 first aider ask me, kw & raymond to help .. actually to borrow our muscles to carry a student who is heat exhausted sort of.. then he no skill lor.. instructions not clear.. own self also react so slow.. dunno how to carry strecher.. IDOIT man.. then want to scold us.. kw & raymond carried the stretcher, i support them in case they roll dwn the stairs & also clear the way for them.. quite nice la.. then the disperse was quite diffcult.. due to some teachers.. then the gate also so small.. luckily some of us try to clear the way fast.. everyone out of stadium @ ard 1930.. abt 45mins only.. YEAH!.. then me & wei jie help the student cross roads.. which is not suppose to be our job.. but then quite dangerous ar.. they cross the road like the cars are those hell cars.. cant knock them dwn.. after tt, we went to help @ another carpark.. make sure the bus dun ram ppl dwn, make sure the students get to their buses..   @ ard 0830, we are dismissed.. the 1st to be bahx.. went to eat @ geylang, talk cock as usual.. mainly talk abt airbourne la.. cause C.S inside mah.. then take bus back..   Conclusion: Today very fun but hectic.. but can learn frm experience la..

      Today nv go NCC training again.. got to go DRAW.. so sian.. miss my cadets man.. 2 wks nv go back.. but then still nvm.. the most terrible is the fucking ahmad.. sry for tt word.. serious is fuck.. i shall elaborate using 2 languages..  English: Today Clemens was late & the whole of dmmt/1a waited for him.. i think this made ahmad abit fucked up.. he drove there.. we took the provided bus.. then ahmad and ms huei went to recee ard 1st.. we were told to wait.. so me, shawn, jh, clemens &amp; feng he went ard taking pics & looking at fishing spots.. then we were called back.. we were told to draw a detailed &amp; then landscape.. we looked ard then ahmad came.. Ahmad: "why are you all still standing ard? quickly settle dwn & start drawing" Shawn:" we are planning, planning takes a very impt part in drawing" Ahmad:"Wat bullshit are you talking abt? who are u trying to con?" Shawn:"erm.. myself" Ahmad:"quickly settle dwn &amp; start drawing.. look how much time u have left"  u guys see la.. wat is this the kind of tone & language a LECTURER shld be talking to the students? come on man.. u burn our sat.. 2ndly i dun think we did anything wrong.. 3rdly, mind ur language.. u pissed me off  then ms huei came.. very nice.. guys, wat u all drawing? We: leaves.. Huei: leaf itself is not detail.. try drawing bark or flowers.. simple and detail  SEE the diff in tone &amp; languange...  MY MIDDLE FINGER salute to Ahmad man..  so we proceeded to some palm trees.. then when me & jh finish ahmad come again.. feng he was slping  it was feng he's wrong for this.. but i think it made him more angry wif the grp..  Ahmad: have u guys finish the drawings? We: left landscape then we quickly pack up &amp; go.. he was in a daze then.. guess watching the kids playing there.. we walked abt 10 steps then he called us back.. Ahmad: where are u guys going? We: going there to draw the field.. Ahmad: you guys are ald so far and yet u still wanted to go further.. wat the hell? go back in..  YES WAT THE HELL.. he said tt.. i actually wanted to scold him but was lost at words..  then we settled to draw a hse.. we saw ms huei drawing wif some ppl.. see the diff again Ms huei: give suggestions on drawing & also drew wif us Ahmad: object initiative, find fault, FUCKED UP .. this kindda of attitude be lecturers? shldnt we be instructing others with a patient, positive and encouraging but firm approach? or were you not good in tt? huh?  then he saw josel, KP they all eating mac & not drawing.. scolded them also.. something like.. u all wont like it when u see me angry.. come on man.. u wont like it when i get rage.. fucker... u are just a bloody course administrator.. &amp; come on.. my parents paid me sch fees to learn not to be scolded by u.. u mean u are paid to bark @ us, fuck u understand..  below is hokkien version of scolding him..  Hokkien: today i jog dulan by GY ahmad.. he zen a kao gy lor.. ka limpei 543.. sai lin nai eh lau pa pu.. bo zui zun.. simi pun meh.. gu pun si ar.. limpei ze pai si ai ka le kae kao.. wed li toi si.. sai lin nai eh lau pa pu.. li xiang ho si ka wa nang ho ho ar kao.. ah si li ko bo guai.. wa tio lia li ke piang piang.. li go kao pei zi pai qi kau mai..  haahaa.. not everyone understand rite.. better dun understand then.. haahaa.. he really cannot make it.. i really pity his wife & children..  TO Ahmad: May god bless u.. u will get it on Wed during the dialogue session man.. i swear to complain u if possible  TO IDEA lecturerS: U all too be bless.. u will be hit by the ICT students taking IDEA.. especially the 2 'boss' u 2 had too much comments ald la.. u sux man.. i think u also dunno wat we presenting contradicting each other.. the 2 ladies worst.. knew nth man.. i know its a new module.. but the 2 of u are too much &amp; the module makes no sense.. moreover it made our design minds gone.. SUCKS!
