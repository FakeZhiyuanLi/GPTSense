      Don't you hate it when people lie to you in your face.  I mean this one person that Lil' John knows he when up to him and said "John, I'm dieing."  now this kid was in perfect health so Lil' John said "no your not, you low life-four flushing sack of lieing shit."  Usually Lil' John doesn't curse, but this kid was messed up, because if Lil' John remembers correctly, He saw him coming out of the Guidance Office a couple of days ago, Aw, the little boy needs help. Too bad for him.  So bottom line, Don't lie to any body!  It's bad for your health.

      Well, after Christmas most kids go around to their friends houses and play with their toys. But not Lil' John, no he mopes around  and tells his life story to all you drunk bastards who can't see straight.  And what's the point with Christmas presents anyway?  I mean kids get presents all year round'.  It's like " Oh, I want this, and I want that, and I want a pony so that I can ride it twice, and then sell so that I can make toothpaste!"

      As the day comes to an end, I would like to take this moment to...err....ok, so I don't know the rest of the speech, but who cares?  No, seriously today is deticated to Josh (A friend of the great Lil' John).  A couple of days ago ,a friend of  Lil' John goes "Were do you think Josh is?" now let's take a moment to think, If you know this kid you would probably fall on the ground waiting for god to take your life.  But words cames out of Lil' John's mouth instead, and the words were "Probably lighting his ass on fire!"

      I have this whole cure to this bio-terrest thing, Keith Richards.  Keith can sniff up anthrax and go, "anthrax, all right, not quite strong enough but what the hell!  Keith makes the Osbornes look like they're frickin' omish, ok.  Suposibly Keith goes to Swizerland and changes his blood, not a pint, like a damn chevy, all of it.  I wonder who get's his blood, some guy goin' "Heidi! got to go on tour, got to pay for mick's babies!" We can all be dead and gone, but Keith would still be their with 5 cockroaches sayin' "I smoked your Uncle, did you know that? CRAZY!"

      The Great Lil' John has demonstrated so pretty messed up rants in the past, but along the way to the psyco house , Lil' John swears on his grave that he will give you the best rants ever...err.....ok, that was a big ,fat juicy lie. Ok, here goes the real rant....Today on Jerry Springer ,Lil' John will confess to his Uncle that his rants are better than Lil' John's ,that's ok though, He's 26!  He has a little more experiance than Lil' John. (but Uncle Carl ,you better watch out ,I'm on a role with rants!)

                                                        The great lil' John was at a gay-ass christmas party, and of course nothing happened!  So lil' John's dad said to him " Do you think that we should go?"  Now without even thinking about it I wanted to get the hell out of there...fast!, But the guy that threw the party was right next to lil' John so I said, " No, I'm having a blast ( I was lieing of course!)  And then lil' John pointed at someone, "Look, that gut moved!"  Like it was some kind of miracle or some thing.  And so I was forced to go to last resort, so lil' John stood up on a chair and announced " Uhhh....Can I have your attention please...Now I would like to say the words that all of have been longing to hear............FIRE!!!!!!!

      Another weekend, gone, back to bad teacher homework-giver person.  Well, look at the bright side...I'm still here!  Today we're going to examine the importance of homework...oh snap, I almost forgot...oh yeah, there is none!.  So, today we're going to vote.  If you like homework, then I will pray for the Grim Reeper to come and kill you, but if you're one of those guys/gurls and that you think that you have enough shit in your life and you can just use the homework as toilet paper, then give my Uncle Carl a shout out at thecarl.blogspot.com.

      I just hate fagets because they do anything to tell you, " I'm not a fag!"  They also lie, cheat, steal, and just are plain sleazy.  When I grow up, I'm just going to line everybody up and say either fag or not.  Also at B.R.M.S, they have their own way of telling people, but it's not to kind or nice.  The perfect example of a fag is Michael Jackass, sorry, Jackson.  If you can look at a person and say " Wow! He's just like the jackass that I hear about in the papers all the time!"  Then just walk up to then and say " Excuse me, kid, I sorry to inform you, but you are a fag!

      Saturday for people with no gurl means nothing!  What's the meaning for Valentine's day if you have no girl?  Ok, aside from that, a quote from Lil' John that I stole from Erin Kenny, thanks Erin!    " You know when somebody says something insulting, it takes 42 muscles in your body to frown, but it only takes 4 to sock him in the nose!"                                                               -Lil' John

      Sup all of you wack-jobs out there it's just lil John. Howdy! Today was an awfull day, 1st, I had to do to a funeral so that sucked! And now my gurlfriend wont talk to me because she's neva' on!  Wat's that about? School sucks!  I'm in mourning because my Uncle died and my Language Arts teacher gives me home work? THANKS MS. GIORDANO!!!  Anyway, after the funeral, I went to I.H.O.P, and the family walked in to the place and we where all in black. I felt like I was in the Mafia! I turned to my Uncle to tell him, and he said "Don't disrespect the family, Joey!"

      This weekend was fun if you're Tiger Woods!  I played golf for 2 days straight!  And then It turns out that I had a little Michael Strahan in me because I played football for 3 hours today. Thanks Mike!  Any way, if anybody doesn't know, my old gurl is gone, so ladies, I'm FREE!!  But, 1 other thing is bothering me and that's I don't know where the boss of the Christian family is?(otherwise code named as thecarl) He hasn't whacked anybody since Joey Z in the Bronx, god rest his soul.  WHAT A GREAT BOSS!!  To be in a family, you need to do 2 things, eat, and whack peeps.  So, I've formed my own family at the great B.R.M.S, the Maggio family. Allow myself to introduce everybody.  Salvitore Maggio- Lil' John Franky Lombardo- Eric Chang Big Bruno- as himself Tony Z- Evan Holtz Leone- as himself Pauli- Josh Tennis Paulo- as himself Mo mo- Andrew C. Jelly- Chris DeBellis Joey G- Jon Sanchez Maria- Michelle Piersanti   And that's the family, watch out Tony Saprano, you might get whacked by 6th graders!

                                 All About Fags!  Today is a day that is all 'bout fags.(In B.R.M.S) that have reached the level of fagness that should be noticed. Below is going to be the normal shit(by now you should be used to it), but this time, Li'l John will not be telling you what he thinks. Suprisingly, Li'l John stole his Uncle's truck and was last seen heading down I-95. If you have any idea about his wereabouts, please contact our off. The number is    1-800-EAT-SHIT. Anyway, here's the list.  Fattest: Matt Riley, Nick Mcgahan, and Forrest(SRY!) Gayest:  Matt Riley, Nick Lindemen, and Frank Loffelman Stupidest: Johnny Leone(SRY!), Kyle Fine, and Jon Sanchez Most Parinoid: Yours Truly!  And last but Li'l John assures you, not least, we have a kid that is too bold, too gay, and too dumb(He evan admits it, u fag!) And this kidis called Shirmp (A.K.A Shrot Stuff) Ok, ok, ok, his real name is IAN ONESKO. Li'l John has a few words for Ian as a matter of fact.  IAN, GET A LIFE!

(Although he is unconditionaly loved in Ethiopia and Uganda, wtf is up with them still lovin Mike!) Any ways, this fag said alot of crazy shit in the past 500 years.  Li'l John has aggred to let you in on some "quotes" that our dear king of pop has said.   "I don't have sex because of my religous beliefs"..............B.S! "I don't molest children, that would be wrong".................6$ and my right nut says that that u do molest kids, u perv. "Children are MAGICAL!"........................................Yea, they are but not when ur around. Also, this man went to the grammys in 1986 with Brooke Shields!

                   Life's Lesson  Today, the great Li'l John has agreed to let you in on 'the mysteries of Life's Lesson'  Have you ever taken anything for granted?  Have you ever been mean to a disabled person?  Well, if you have, then don't do it any more because one day, the person that you made fun of will come and bite you in the ass when you least expect it.(In other words, will come and make fun of you. Believe me, i know)  But this doesn't mean when you push a door that says 'pull', or you jump off a bridge because your friend told you to, that doesn't mean that that was one of the many 'life's lesson's' that you have to learn to get used to.  Well, it's not, because what you did was just plain, old STUPID!  So, to end this rant, Li'l John has some words of wisdom for all of you...  don't do anything and 10 minutes later you say "Holy Shit, i can't believe that i just did that!" Because after that, you either have 10,000 people laughing at you, or, you have a huge rip in your pants and 3 broken ribs!

       Another Pole   I hope by now you know the routine by now that i''l give you the spiel on the 2 people that you have to choose to be like, so here he goes.&nbsp; Today,&nbsp; you've got to choose between Tommy Vercetti and Hannibal Lecter, sorry  DR.  Hannibal Lecter.&nbsp; So, on 1 hand, you've got guns, women, and MIAMI!&nbsp; And, on the other you've got jail, smarts, and the stuff to take on an entire army.&nbsp; Of corse the odds are that you're goin to take Tommy's shoes, but he's as dumb as a box of rocks, but if you take Lecter, then you're in an 6 x 8 cell with only a bucket to shit in.&nbsp; So, this pole is hard.&nbsp; But, you're the ones deciding, so, go and do your civic duty and choose...               ">      or...     &nbsp;    You decide, again?

       Which Michael Jackson do you wanna be like?      Ok, Ok, Ok, I know that no one want's to be like mike, except for Prince in the 80's (Jacko wanna-be)&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; there are good side to being like our dear king of pop...       Living in Santa Barbara, California, in Neverland with an amusement park, and all the shit that you want.&nbsp; But, dont think that there aren't down sides...     You have no wife, you almost got thrown in jail for being  too  close to kids, and you've got the face to scare off Hannibal Lecter!&nbsp; So choose, king of pop, or wacko jacko...        ">      or...      ">      you decide.
