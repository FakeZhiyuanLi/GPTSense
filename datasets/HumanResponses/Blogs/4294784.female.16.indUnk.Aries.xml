      Yay! I am one excited Fishie! There is to be a Kidney gathering, and guess who's invited? *points to self* Yippeeee! It's looking like I will be able to go to this gathering, and quite possibly stay the whole time, because it's not very far away! Oh, and this is completely non-related to the gathering, but we just installed high speed internet, so I can now surf the web very quickly. It brings this Fishie much joy and general excitedness. Ah, yes, today is a very good day. It's Saturday, I'm going to see my friends, and I have high-speed internet. *closes eyes and relaxes happily in this wonderfully glorious day* ~Fishie

      Hello everyone! The Fishie has decided that, as many of her friends already have blogs/blurties, she should try one out too! I suppose I'm supposed to write about my day in this, so, here goes! Today was, of course, a Friday, so that definitely made the whole school thing more bearable. My classes are pretty cool this semester. I have Drama I, French IV, AP Environmental Science, and AP English. And, despite the two APs, this is actually the easiest semester I've had since eighth grade. Drama is my favorite class by far. We played a lot of random drama games today, including a bunch of improv and gibberish. The Fishie very much enjoys speaking in the language that is nonsensical and nonexistant! *giggles* And in AP Environmental, we dissected owl pellets. I'm still deciding whether that was fun or not. It was definitely more fun than note taking, but kinda smelly. I found a lot of really cool mouse bones though, so that was fun. AP English was okay too, we took a test, but it was fairly easy. I got a little homework, but since it's FRIDAY (*celebrates with great joy*) I DON'T HAVE TO DO IT TODAY!!! *sigh* Unfortunately, my first blog entry must come to an abrupt close because it's my bedtime. I'll try this blogging thing again tomorrow! Goodnight all! ~Fishie
