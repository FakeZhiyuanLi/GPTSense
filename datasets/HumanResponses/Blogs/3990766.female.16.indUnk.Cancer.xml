       urlLink    sometime we human ever wondered what is the term "life"? LIfe is a simple cycle abt born and death.. it's also abt the meaning y u r living on earth.. and u will askin urself y r u being born.. u r born to see and explore this world.. the word "life"  to us may sounds nth but "life" to others will seems to be sth special which lightens up their life and colours their world.. life is not short or long but it will simply end one day.. But does we sometimes do ask ourself in life why there's so many ups and downs.. do we have to face all these in order to grow as we learn.. we born to learn to love and also to know wat is true friendships and kinship.. in this world some where or some corner.. asking what is the term of true love, or does it exist? will dreams come true.. some one in this world asking would i be able to the the sun rise of tomorrow.. we do ask ourself lots of questions.. but the reason you are here.. there might not be a reason goes with it.. but u, yourself are the one who create the reason why u are living in this world.. u might not agree.. but tat's what i think... is life destinated? or brought by fate.... you will only have the answer in urself...&nbsp; urlLink

The only way to love isn't finding the perfect person but loving the imperfect person perfectly.True love doesn't have a happy ending ,it's simply doesn't end...   PeRhapS LovE iS gOnNa ChNgE My wOrLd..   LiFe Had eNded WHEn u sToP dReaminG ,HopE EnDS when U stop BeLieving and LOve eNds When U stOp cariNg..   Faith makes all things possible while Hope makes all things worK and LOVE makes all things beautifuL..   AnD the LovIeST is To oUt thAT LovE hav stIll CoLOUrS YouR world WItH peoPLe CarINg a aboUt U..     MY fiRST LovE...    I get to know WQ in causeway point shooping centre, the first time we saw each other was on level 2 as me and my fren was there walking and he and his fren was walking pass a shop name Chamelon.. at that very moment as we saw each other, our eyes seems like caught each other.. maybe it's so call First Sight Love, it was simply like LIAN SHI JIU which had only happens.. when the first sight i look at him into his eyes even though only a few seconds but till today i can remember it.. he got a kindda of charm which i can't use words to explain.. he looks damm cool and quiet.. but i guees i'll never know him.. but not long after that while i was accompanying my friend waiting for her friend,unexpectly WQ coming toward me and ask me for hp no. but i refuse cos i scare and shy.. was i dreaming i wonders i never thought he would want to know me.. he was the first person who ask for my number.. but i ran to my friend for help but instead of helping me she gave him my no. but if bot her.. i guess i wouldn't be knowing WQ.. that was when i start knowing him... at first we started by sms and then talking on phone.. after a few weeks after knowing him.. found that he was a damm gd guy.. and soon i fell in love with him.. although we like each other as we know each other more.. although he was a guy that i guess many girls would dream to have.. he was simply jus like their ideal perfect guy ba..but soon feeling seems like losing through time.. sometimes i wondering.. was it FAtE or DeStiNaTed? bUt when i was in love with him.. everything seems like wonderful.. days r sweets.. memories r sweet too.. but all these was over.. thinking back.. it hav been 2 years plus ago when i know him.. He will always be in my heart as a beautiful memory in my life till the last day of my life.. i will always remember the deep was my love and the sweet,sour,sad and everything.. thanks you for everything and u hav light up my life.. remember the days we talk craps on phone, scolding each other piggy and penguin although it was a stupid thing but i'm really happy and glad that u will spent your time talking wif me this bai chi..le.. i also remember u always ask me not to haiz.. but not long soon this was our silent break or wat..we seems like stop talking for so long.. without hurting each other.. i guess.. i did remember there was a time when he told me if he couldn't do well for N level he may Go to austrilla to study.. at that moment i damm sad my heart was broken.. luckily he got second lne call in at then.. at tat moment my tears falls aparts on my cheeks.. after that he came back to my call.. he say he might not stay in SIngapore and wat i think.. i said it's gd.. and its gd for ur future.. all those stuffs.. but in my heart i really can't bare to lose him.. i was realli sad.. and this lasted for weeks and months ba..i always put this email add at a group only with him in it as special.. as he is a special person in my heart always.. perhaps our fate wa not that deep.. hope everyone will cherish your love ones as this might be fate brought both of u together.. do not make any regrets in your life..       another story..    of me and wk...he was my 4th ex... i knew last year,wk..  He knew me through a friend of mine.. he is kindda of a sincere guy and he is always opstimistic.. he was like shi wan ge wei shen mer real super.. anything ask him he will know and he seems to be able to slove anything no matter wat.. although we only stead not long but it seems like we hav stead for years.. he is the first person who gave such a wonderful surprise on my birthday in my life..he was out late under my block..i didi not know and he is talking on phone with me till it reaches 12am it's my birthday and i thought he would want to sing me a b day song but end up he say to put down phone le.. haiz..  but i never thought of it.. he sms me ask me to open my door and i sneak out to open my door secretly as i do not want to wake my parents up.. to my suprise i saw him standing there holding a big bag.. jus like a santa clause and wanted to give me my b day present.. i'm really touch and shock.. i would never forget my special 15th b day... i knew he is made to be a gd bf but.. soon all this nice and sincere really did made me touch and i decide to give him a chance and we start steading..we seems like went through so much feng feng yu yu and we still together.. i still remember when i was working at kfc last year,end of the year holidays he will feng yu bu gai ,no matter what he will come and accompany me home till i reach my door.. then he go home.. i'm really touch and glad wat he did for me.. he told me he is a impatient person and yet he willing to wait for me so long whenever i finishing my work and also whenever i was late when i meet him..  and my parents are in the dark that i have stead.. as they are veri strict and dun allow me to have stead at such a young age.. one day unexpectly i was caught by my dad when he was accompanying me back home after my work.. end up.. my parents questioned me and eventually found out my parents and his parents kindda of know each other and both of our parents had approve us t be together.. i never thought they would allow.. the days with him are always sweet and happy.. everything was goping fine.. but since school starts i really dunno wat's wrong with myself.. eventually i felt that feelings with him were lost all of the sudden.. i'm wondering and questioning myself had i realli did love him before.. and i know.. he will be veri hurt if i ask for a break out.. i know.. he was realli feeling low and depress when i ask for a break out.. i didn't want to hurt him.. but if i don't break up with him.. i will seems to turn crazy.. perhaps is like i can't concentrate on studies both on realtionship at the same time.. and there was another reason for the break out.. but the secret will always remain with me forever.. but after it for so long.. i guess your wound have been heal.. i see that you are back to your happy go lucky life, i'm really glad.. but i really sorry that i've made a deep cut in your heart which made u hurt deeply ..     urlLink
