      I am so happy that Adria did not get voted off of BB5! I can't wait till next week when the twist is revealed. It's not that Adria is my favorite player, although I like her. But I'm just glad that there is now a chance to get some of the annoying 'Horemen' out of the house. And I have to say that I believe Holly truly was a ditz. For a while, I thought she might have been using that as her strategy, but unfortunately not!

      Well, it seemed that our 4 month old Bryant was doing better the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; We found out at his 4 month check-up that he has yet another double ear infection!!&nbsp; That means he will be getting tubes.&nbsp; The pediatrician says that he will be a completely different child when his ears aren't constantly hurting him.&nbsp; I'm definitely looking forward to that, even though Bryant is an angel the majority of the time!&nbsp; So hip hip horray for tubes!

      I don't know about other mother's, but sick time for me does not exist at home.&nbsp; I have a wonderful little family, and I love taking care of them... but when I'm sick it just seems to be so much more burdening!&nbsp; And while my husband tries to be helpful, I just don't think he thinks of everything that still needs to be done.&nbsp; He tells me to go and rest, but the babies bottles still need to get done, and the car seat needs to be moved, and the van needs gas, and on and on and on.&nbsp; Sick time at work is hard to come by too!&nbsp; I work for my father's business and my mom covers for me if I'm sick, but sometimes she just isn't available, so on days like today when I feel rotten, life trudges on.

      Who would have thought that a cup of coffee could make your day seem to flow smoother?&nbsp; I used to think that people who just "had to have" that cup of coffee to start their day were silly.&nbsp; But after our second little boy was born, I found that a cup of coffee was like a caffeine life line.&nbsp; Sure... Tres might be unfolding the wash I just folded.&nbsp; Sure... Bryant might be spitting up on my newly mopped floor.&nbsp; Sure... I forgot to send in the power bill on time.&nbsp; As long as it all happens while I'm holding that cup of salvation, everything is fine!

      Okay, so thus far, I am a little underwhelmed with Big Brother.  A lot of Alpha males, and stereotyping in this season.  And I'm finding Project DNA a little cruel with Cowboy and Jennifer.  Or... maybe I'm just so tired from getting ready for a yard sale that I'm not in the mood for it!  Yard sales sure are a lot of trouble for so little money!  But we want to put aside a little extra for when we take our oldest son Tres to Disney in October.

      As you may know by now, I love reality TV.  And with Big Brother and Amazing Race kicking off this week, I'm in hog heaven!  Although, I have to say that the twist on Big Brother feels slightly off.  I mean how fair is it to play on that poor cowboy's emotions like that when he is trying to play a game to win money for his family?  It just feels wrong.  And how creepy do you think the purple hair girl feels with him asking all the question about her dad.  AND somebody please tell me that the ditsy blonde girl is NOT in porn as it appears!

      Having a very close sister myself, I know it must be nice to be able to completely trust at least one person in the BB5 house.  But that is about the only alliance I would count on lasting.  All the other alliances (even Drew and Diane) will eventually be severed.  If I were in the house, I would hope I could play the game like Marvin.  No definite allies or enemies.  He seems to be enjoying himself while playing on the edges of both groups.

      I am sooo upset!  Another one of my close friends is moving away.  And not just a couple of hours away either!  Josie and Jerome Jones are moving to Palmetto, FL.  Who's even heard of Palmetto?  Another of my close friends lives in Atlanta.  They moved there before Tres was born, but I just now feel like I'm getting used to that one, so I can imagine it's gonna take a while for this one to aclimate.  Zoe is one of Tres playmates, so it will probably take a while for him to understand that he can't play with her anymore!  Man, being grown-up sucks sometimes!

      I would totally love to see a celebrity Big Brother competition!  Could you imagine celebrities giving up control and cell phones and everything to be locked in house with other celebrities??  It would be funny!  Now that would be worth TiVo-ing!!

      Well Bryant got tubes put in on Monday.  It was so pitiful!  When they brought him back to me after the surprisingly short procedure, he was so unhappy and loopy acting.  But the good news is that he seems to be more happy these days (reportedly from less pain in his ears).  His spit-up seems to have decreased as well.  The doctor did tell us that when he put the tubes in, there was severe infection behind both ears, which I guess accounts for the drainage now!  My poor little guy!  Tres keeps saying "Bryant ears boo-boo!"  He loves his little brother so much already!
