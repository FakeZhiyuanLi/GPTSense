      I was just discussing with my brother how we should try all different things in life. He mentioned some really interesting points.  Quoting him, "if u r open to all kind of ideas, &nbsp;there is a lot of learning happening.. & its at ur discreation to store or eliminate data. At the end of the day the data collected by u makes u more unique. But, at the same time, the data we need we dont have...the data we have we dont need".  This is such a contradiction. Does this mean we should stop trying? After all we do not achieve the outcome that we so desire. Is it wrong data or is it&nbsp;wrongly interpreted data? Possibly, all that we need to do is to look at things from a different angle. Our closed minds cause all the problems. Maybe, after carefully analyzing the situation the graph might just curve upwards than&nbsp;drooping down.  Need to think abt this...

      To gossip or not to gossip. Is that really a question?  I think not.  This chitchat is more like sharing facts. Facts that widen your horizon of knowledge. Nobody cares about the characters in the play, its limited to what they do. Actions that inform us about the innumerable possibilities we can indulge into. Its such a great thing! an understanding that produces the best learning curve.  We all do it. Some teach and learn within closed doors and some out in the field. Whatever the location might be, make sure that there aren't any glass houses and no stones around.

      Ever wonder what miracle really means. Beats me! It seems like a concept u just love to live with, knowing very well that it's just a concept. The very personifaction of being an emotional fool. Things that we want more than anything in this world are all grouped under this one category. Ain't that a game of sarcasm that life plays on u.   "Get used to it"

      I am not sure if I am freaking out for the right reasons. Is the situation so out of hand that I have lost all control on it, or things are just the way they need to be? Confusion! Confusion! Is my tolerance level so low? Am I not trying enuf? Maybe the subject of my accusations ain't that bad. Probably he is just different. If I cud just acclimatize to such disparities I might be better of. Is it all about adaptation?

      Each day opens up with some promises to distribute...keeps me rolling. I hope this enthusiasm never dies down. Its a pleasure to be moving along with people u care about the most. I just love 'em. But!!! All this is gonna change. Never can decide whether change has a flattering or a hostile effect on life. If i wish that life comes to a stanstill, that takes away from me the opportunity to experience different versions of existence. On the other hand the lego pieces are  scattered and rearranged in a totally different structure, unknown to me.  It all comes to, "Enjoy life while u can, who knows where it takes u next".
