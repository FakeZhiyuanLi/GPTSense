      Yeah...Another week has passed.&nbsp;24 July&nbsp;will be one of the most memorable days of my life. Cultural Potpourri was a great success. The 'innovative class' dance members did their dance for the last time. It was so exciting, yet very sad for all of us. The sec 4s had to leave us, and this dance would become history. Almost everyone cried bitterly, including Mrs. Wong. I felt so confused, whether to feel happy or sad. In the end, I ended up both crying out for joy and weeping tears of sadness. I would never forget the happy days of the 'Innovative Class' Dance. The joys and pains of being part of this dance is totally beyong words. I'm getting so emotional that I'm writing so much. Ok, lets continue. The concert was unforgettable, and I felt so emotional that I literally screamed my heart out. For many of you, you would never see me do that for sure. :) Tears of sadness dribbled down the cheeks of many sec 4 and 3&nbsp;CCA members, be it Dance or even Guzheng. There is always an end to good things. Then again, I just can't bear to see this dance, and the sec 4 members leave me. This must be my longest entry ever. Hahaz. May the memories of the wonderful past remain in our hearts always.

      Well, its back to school after the long weekend break, and the common tests are just around the corner. Oh well. Apparently, my mind appears to be a bit of a daze these days. I desperately need to concentrate on my studies. Ok, I'll cut this message short. Our class finally got an 'A' grade for cleanliness!! Yipee!! Hopefully, this standard can continue till we  are allowed to get a class t-shirt. Ok...gotta go now...Study hard you peeps!! Don't spend too much time online!!!!

      Well, I woke up pretty early today in order to go to school for the Maths Warrior Competition thingy. Jia Hao, Kakeru, Yuzheng, Kit Yeng, Chin Kuan, and many others had volunteered themselves too to help out at the competition as judges, usherers and helpers. It was indeed an experience for all of us. Well, the bottomline was that we had to do a lot of walking around the hall. There was of course another reason why we were there. CIP. I also made a few sec 2 friends from school. It was indeed 'killing FOUR birds with one stone'. Firstly, I will get 5 hrs worth of CIP. Secondly, I met lotsa new friends. Thirdly, I received a souvenir from the organiser. It was, of course, a wonderful dice game worth $8. Last but not least, I got to socialise with friends like Kakeru and Kit Yeng, whom I don't usually talk much to in school. See how cool this decision was?

       Well, I had alot of fun today... Basically, I wanted to let loose during the National Day celebrations, but unfortunately, it would indeed be embarassing if i'm the only one to shout & scream in the class. Note that everyone else in school were screaming and shouting while our class remained seated and some were even reading books. How lame.
