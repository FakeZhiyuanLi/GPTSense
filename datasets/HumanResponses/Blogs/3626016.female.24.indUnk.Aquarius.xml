      We got a new puppy.  She's adorable, of course, but she has no name.  I started my training at Outback.  It is fine.  So far none of my 2 trainers have made very much money so it makes me wonder.  I might as well try and find another job during the day so that I don't end up living at home forever.  Or I could just play with the pup or lay out by the pool until it's time to go into work everyday.  Tomorrow I'm gonna go eat at Thai place, the best restaurant in Kansas city.  Yum.  It's so fattening and great.  The guy who trained me at work tonight is moving away so I will probably never see him again.  I'm not sad about it at all.  Sometimes I feel weird whenever I drive by cars or somethin and see the people doing their thing and realize that there is probably no chance I will ever see them again in my lifetime.  You'd think it would make me want to get to know people better.  Hmm. It doesn't, though.  The other day I must have dislocated my jaw temporarily because it hurt to chew or brush my teeth (but I still did both anyway).  It's okay today.  I've eaten pizza the past three days in a row.  I am on the all carb diet.  Oh, except for I drink Diet Sprite, just to save on the calories and all.  I need to go to the gym but instead I'm going out to eat for lunch tomorrow.  My priorities are not really in line.  One day I will work out every day and eat healthy all the time.  I'll probably die that next week.  I truly believe that I am going to live to be 103, though.  When they ask me "what's your secret?", I will tell them that I ate as many carbs as possible and that I watched infomercials about workout equipment from the comfort of my recliner.  Hopefully I will get at least a mention on the 10 o'clock news.  I would go on but I really feel like I can't write much now that I've been talking about the last birthday of my life.  I'll start new next time.

      I start working Saturday.  I need to make a resume so that I can get a real job, though.  My dog must have rolled around in something bad outside because she smells really bad.  I don't even wanna touch her.  I need to mow the yard tomorrow.  I like listening to my mp3 player while I mow the yard.  My mom and sister come home from Las Vegas tomorrow.  That would be nice if they brought me back some cash.  My sister got her picture taken with Tommy Lee in the Las Vegas airport.  I've never met anyone famous before.  Unless you count Jason Mraz.  I have a picture with him.  He's skinny.  When he signed the poster I got of him, I made him draw a mustache on himself.  I gave it to my friend because she's in love with him.  That was my brush with fame.  I would like to be famous.  I would like it if people wanted to know my business.  I need a job.  Good thing my dog left me alone because she stinks and she needs a bath.  I should become a professional dog bather.  I might get bitten but it's all in a day's work, I guess.  I need to find my calling one of these days.  I'm off to look for it.  Goodbye.

      I need a job.  I have 2 five-dollar bills in my purse, negativefiftyfourdollars in my checking account, and only half a tank of gas left in my car.  Going to spain for a semester was actually a good idea for someone who doesn't mind going into a little debt.  "It's okay, I'll come back and work at Hereford House whenever I come home", I told myself back in January when I had over $2,000 in my bank and no bills to pay off.  So I've been back for practically a month now and I'm finally forcing myself to find any other place that will hire me since my old job apparently has no room left for me to work there.  They're missing out.  Oh well.  Bigger and Better.  hmm.  Too bad the only 'Bigger and Better' in my future is the Outback Steakhouse.  Crikey! My life is great. I really need a job, though.

      Writing in my blog reminds me of going to the gym.  I don't have to make excuses though.  In the long run, I'm the one who will suffer.  Nobody else.  I'm the one who will be out of shape and void of any useless memories as the ones I might write about today.  That's okay though.  I'm sure I will forget about this blog one day altogether in the same way that I will forget about going to the gym ever again.  When I'm stuck with a day that's gray and lonely, I just stick out my chin and grin and say.  The sun will come out tomorrow.  Come what may.   Musicals hold the answers to many of my questions.  Or maybe I should say musicals hold the answers to too many of my questions. If I only had a brain.  Right now I have two dogs trying to convince me it's time to go to bed.  The two pound puppy was fine laying on me but now that the eleven-pounder is up here too, it's a bit much.  No offense, Bella, but maybe you should consider taking up a yoga class or something.  I joke, I joke.  I love my mutant chihuahua.  Speaking of yoga though.. I should probably start off my week with a trip to the gym tomorrow.  Or I could stay home and write in my blog some more.  Somewhere out there, skies are blue, and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.  Sweet dreams.
