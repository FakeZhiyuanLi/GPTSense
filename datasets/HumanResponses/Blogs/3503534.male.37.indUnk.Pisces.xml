      My first burned-in memory goes like this:  It was eight days since we'd first kissed; I guess it was about five days since we'd semi-officially proclaimed we were "a couple."   We went to Desire Video to pick up some nitrous oxide.   Then we went driving. We were traveling along East Bay Road, with her juggling the dispenser, the balloons and the nitrous capsules themselves. She kept the car on the road while preparing the balloons, handing the first one to me, sucking on hers, and repeating the process.  We headed out towards Boston Harbor. I think we stopped behind a Shell station to kiss; then we drove along the back roads of BH.  I'd made a Startling Admission the night before; that I "loved her."  One week since our first kiss.  I couldn't help the admission; she'd turned the interior car light on, I saw her face in full view, and I couldn't say anything else than "I love you." She told me she loved me too. She also told me she was relieved because I'd said it first. She never had.  Digressing. We're driving the roads, which all have 35-mph to 40-mph speed limits. I wasn't stoned, so I was pondering the ramifications of my admission.  "Hey, Jenny..." I began as she drove. "I wanted to tell you something about last night..."  "Yeah?" she said. "What?"  "Well, I've developed really strong feelings for you, and I know you're in a heap of pressure right now," I said.  We came across a part of the road that was being repaved. The tar had been removed, so we were driving across gravel.  "So I..." I continued, "...wanted to let you know, that's just how I was feeling. It was pretty inescapable at the time. I know you're going through a hard living situation right now, and I don't want to put too much..."  At the end of the gravel road she made a U-turn. We were going to my house, I thought, and were headed in the direction of my house when she reversed course.  "Uh..." I stammered, "what's up?"  "Oh," Jenny said. "I saw this hill back there on this street, and I wanted to jump it."  "Jump it?"  "Yeah. The suspension on this car is great."  "Jump it? Like,  The Fast and the Furious ?"  "Yeah, I do it all the time. Whenever I can find a good hill."  The car had gone through the gravel a second time, in the opposite direction, and re-emerged with the paved portion.  "So..." I said, "...uh, are we gonna get airborne?"  "Probably not," Jenny said. "But it's a trip, dude."   She went driving down the road, and approached 50 mph. "You ever jumped a hill?"  I looked at her quizzically for a nanosecond, then said, "No."  "It's great," she said. She loaded up one of the balloons with nitrous.  "Do you... you know," I said, "do this kind of thing often? I mean, do you scout for hills, or what?"  "Kind of," she said. "But I really like it with this car's suspension."  She sucked down half the nitrous from the balloon; now she was at 70 mph.  "You know how it is," she continued after removing the balloon from her lips. "You see an opportunity, dude, you take it."  75 mph. I grabbed onto the handle above the passenger window. "Well, yes... in certain more personal, non-vehicular situations, of course..."  "Carpe diem," I would have liked to hear her say. Instead she just looked cool and calm and hit the gas pedal. She sucked down the rest of the nitrous.  "Oh," she said at 80 mph. "What were you saying about -- pressure in the relationship?"  "Oh," I said. "Well... um, it kind of seems irrelevant now that we're hurtling to our deaths."  "You're not scared, are you?" Jenny asked.  "I wouldn't say 'scared' is the right word. More like..."  90 mph. "No, I'm not scared," I said. The hill was in sight. "That's the hill, isn't it?"  "Yep," she said. Now this is where my memory of the speedometer counters Jenny's. I could swear she topped out at 90, and nothing more. She claims she took the hill at 100.  "Oh, fuck," I said. "There's the hill."  We hit top speed at the bottom of the hill and ascended rapidly. I was wondering how I was going to explain to the family that I'd been turned into a paraplegic because I'd co-piloted and flown a car to its, and our, deaths. Wait, then I wouldn't have had to explain it, would I?  The car did not fly. It did not get airborne; it just descended real quick. The suspension  was  excellent. I felt very little.  "That was it?" I asked.  "Yeah," she responded. "Wasn't it cool?"  "I didn't really feel anything."  "I told you! The suspension. You were really  hoping  to fly over the hill, weren't you?"  "Well... all right, gotta admit, yes I was. I was hoping to get some  Starsky & Hutch  action. That was  nothing ."  Jenny slowed the car down to near the speed limit and sought a place to make a left so we could return home.  "Hmm," I said. "There wasn't anything to that. Now I'm not scared of  anything ," I partially joked.  "Told ya," Jenny said.  She moved in three days later. We'd known each other for ten days.

      She said I was her "soulmate."  Nobody in their right mind should overuse the word "soulmate." Personally, for me, it's barely a foot away from the "hippie drivel" line.  But it works for me; if Jenny wants to call me a "soulmate" after knowing her for a fraction of a cosmic second, that's fine. We hit the ground running a couple weeks ago.  This is about a relationship from as close to the beginning as possible. Jenny doesn't know I'm doing this; neither does anyone else.  Normally nobody would risk the entire objective of a blog on something like a brand-new relationship -- face it, sometimes these things end in a matter of weeks, and you look silly for even having faith in the long run of it.  There's something about Jenny, though. I have a feeling if I follow it, it's going to last a long time. Therefore justifying the aim of this blog.  She's different. Dunno why. But she is. On with the show.

      The beginning, if you want to get strict about it, went completely unnoticed. There was absolutely no indication of anything beyond a bizarre, quick anecdote about an encounter with an asterisk.  But it happened at a burlesque show that I happened to be hosting, during ArtsWalk the last weekend of April.   (Yes, burlesque. Lotsa people in this town seem to be rediscovering the lost art of burlesque, a more quaint form of the exotic entertainment we get these days in other counties. But in Thurston you can't take your bra off. No tits. And no touching. Nobody gets to touch anything.  (Which may account for our feeling communally deprived, but to continue:)  I was wearing this tacky, rather smelly and very white sports jacket. It was loaned to me by Kurt. It was considered gaudy and bleached enough to convey the kind of Osmond-bright white we were looking for. I think I was also wearing a silk shirt. Doesn't matter.  She was wearing...  Well, to be quite honest again, she was wearing Insane Clown Posse makeup.  Okay. Stop. Stop right there.  Let me tell you something about the bluebloods I  had  been courting before Jenny. All wonderful girls. But all protective of something. You could tell they all curated an aspect of their personalities they thought it important to promote at the expense of something they needed to conceal. I mean, (a) believed an image was important; (b) hid behind her childish sexuality - we never had a deep talk, she never wanted to know me; (c) moved out of town; (d) became one of my best friends; (e) also moved out of town, but moved back; (f) was still getting over a breakup; (g) forgot my first name on our second date; (h) obviously had something that hurt her that I didn't want to risk adding to.  The way I see it, why not think a Juggalette might have some advantage over any or all of them?  But that's not what I was thinking that night. As far as I knew she was some drunk ArtsWalk joker in green makeup just harassing the hired help.  I'd go into details, but they're really not interesting, nor are they important; let's just leave it at the fact that an ICP fan approached me while I was wearing the worst outfit I'd ever worn in public, and seemed enthusiastic about the rapport.  All this happened at the China Clipper. So does the following:  A couple of nights later, I ran into Jenny at Clipper karaoke. I sat down next to her -- she was wearing her big glasses, and was cordial if not totally chummy to me. At some point she leaned over and told me that she was the Jugglette who approached me on burlesque night; I recognized her and repeated what she'd said to me. I thought nothing of it and went home. Might've jacked off to her, but I don't remember.  Yes, I'm planning on her reading this someday. Maybe after the wedding.  Anyway. The next week, I was back at karaoke at the Clipper. She was there. I don't remember what happened, but I remember her giving me a ride home that night. I guess we chummed it up pretty good or something.  She dropped me off at home and I kissed her. She seemed appreciative. I kissed her on the neck and she, again, seemed appreciative. We exchanged numbers. She wrote her name as "Peach" on the paper.  I called her about 30 minutes after she dropped me off, just to "see if she made it home okay." She said she had, that she was half-asleep and that I should call her the next day. I said fine and hung up.  The next two days, of course, I didn't call her. I wasn't sure it was anything more than a quick dalliance of a kiss. I'd had those recently; why would this have been anything different?  So I spent those two days thinking about other things and not paying Peach/Jenny any mind.  Then Thursday night, instead of attending a birthday party I was invited to go to on the West Side, I decided to stay downtown and travel around the bars.  I went to the Brotherhood first; then decided I'd try to hit someone's show at the Voyeur. I went there, and decided that for the hell of it I'd slip over to the Clipper.  Now, I kind of remember in the back of my mind that I was going back to the Clipper to see if Jenny was there. Otherwise, I don't think I would have left the Voyeur, or if I had, I would have hit McCoy's instead. I definitely wouldn't have chosen the Clipper.  This time I did, though, to see if Jenny would show up. She was there. She was sitting at the east end of the bar, and there was a seat open next to her.  Again, I didn't think anything of it. Even after our first kiss.  Forgive me, but I'm going to quit now. I'm getting maudlin. Well, not maudlin, but I'd kind of like to go into how every other word from Jenny's mouth is a variant of the word "fuck."  Like I said, this came from nowhere and doesn't make any rational sense. But, well...  Fuckin' fuck it.

      The lease.  Her name's on the goddamn lease now.  The landlord said her rental check went fine.  She paid two-thirds the pet deposit for her cat and signed an amended lease agreement.  Tonight I sang to her.  Look, I've never fuckin'  sung  to  anybody  in my entire  life  before.  Perhaps I should start at the beginning:

      Hated chasing after love. Just hated it. So I stopped.  Two and a half years devoted to the transient. Nothing was going to entrap me. For years before that, I was willing to enslave myself for the sake of good cooking and relatively consistent sex. Gee, but I'd hate to denigrate every past relationship to a mere acknowledgement of convenience. But after a bit that's all they became.   They all started out passionately enough, I suppose. But it was never long before the pretty words stopped and the mechanistic expectations began. On their part, but mine too, I guess. I always had pictures of depleted bank statements running through my head.  Nothing was going to suck me in, ever again. I was a prince for two and a half years. Not necessarily a good prince, just a prince. I'd never stay in the same place for too long. I'd run at the first sign of complication. I'd pre-emptively get out of situations if I thought they were going to be disappointments. I came close, real close, before Jenny, to succumbing to a disappointment, but I reversed my normal course. I got out. I ran. Left on my own terms with my good standing intact. I was bulletproof. They weren't going to kick me around anymore. If you wanted to get to know me more intimately, you were going to have to scrape away. You'd have to do all the work yourself. If I thought you would turn on me -- not even if you turned on me, but if you were going to offer the same, repeated litany of not being ready because of whatever reason, et cetera et cetera -- I was gone before you knew it. I was back in my hole, and I tried to leave the impression that I'd never even come out of it in the first place. I would simply vanish. You would simply cease to exist. I was an expert at turning the living into ghosts. You would walk by me and I refused to see you. If you had infected me for even the quickest moment, you would never know. I would never look you in the eyes. Psychically, I had bullied you back into being a stranger. Nothing more.  You were a past guest on my talk show, pretty much, that's all there was to it. It hurt too much to try and turn you into Ed McMahon.  That should give you enough to go on for the time being.
