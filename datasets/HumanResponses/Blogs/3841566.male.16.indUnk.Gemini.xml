      My whole day was pretty boring, but it was kind of funny at work. Me and my friend Charles Vanover were bringing in a train of carts, it was 30 carts, and this fat lady walked over a curb and tripped. It was kinda funny but I felt kinda sorry for her. That was close to another time a fat lady fell. It was at MJR last summer and we were leaving from a movie, I don't remember what it was, and she fell going to her car that her husband or so drove up to pick her up. If you ever looked at the sidewalk near the entry before about 3 months ago there was dark pavement stuff there because the lady broke it. Well now they fixed it and it looks better now but she did break it really bad. Also at work with Scott Stoinski there was some bad carts, you know the ones that can't move right, and we had to bring them to the back of the store with other bad carts. Yea well while we were doing that we ran on the backs of them there are we threw them into the the fence. Well a cop drove up to us and was like "why were you riding those carts". Scott said that's were the carts go. The cop said "was the fence bad that you needed to throw them, and you could get fired". I was really scared just because it was a cop. Those were the major highlights of my day.

      Sorry I haven't posted in a while I was at my dad's house. I had a good weekend. After work on Friday I went to my dad's house, and when I got there and parked in his driveway my car just reached 66,600 miles. Yea I know 666 is the sign of the devil but nothing happened yet that would suggest the devil was at work. There is nothing to worry about you can still approach me. I won't bite, much.

      So I finnaly got my braces, and boy do they hurt. The pain they said should go away in 3 to for day, but it only hurts because my gum is loose. I can't wait till the the pain goes away, actually I can't wait till I get them off. I only have to wear them fo 9 months, and what some people tell me that it is not that long compared to how long they had to have them on. After my appointment I went and called Aaron Tinsley. I drove over to his house for the first time, and I also went in my car by myself too. At around 3:30 is when my teeth started to hurt but I had to go home to get ready for work. It made me mad at my mom that I still had to drive to work with her. I only have about 40 hours of driving time, shhhhh. That doesn't mean that I can't drive to work by myslf because it is not that hard. Work wasn't that hard because I got to put items away again. I was actually only supposed to have one break but I had two without them knowing. Ha Ha Ha. I should be able to buy a new computer soon for myself, and I can't wait.

      So I finally got my temporary license today but my mom is being gay and she thinks I still can't drive by myself. Yea I still have to drive with her. POS. If you didn't know I also bought a car. It is a 99 ZX-2 Escort with a black exterior. I got it for $5000 with tax, title, and license. They were asking $7000 for it by itself so I got a good deal on it. It drives really good but it is only a 4-cylinder chamber for it doesn't have very good acceleration, but that doesn't matter. I also bought a TV from my friend today so I don't know what the screen size is but it is a wide screen. I would say it is a 20'' screen. It is really nice though. I am still waiting for my N64 expansion pack I ordered over the internet on May 7, 2004. It really makes me mad that I waited so long, and that I am still waiting for it. I am going out to dinner at The Rainforest Cafe' in one of the shopping malls with Game Works in it but I don't remember the name of the mall. I am eating with my mom and my cousins and second cousins, so they are not around my age except for my second cousins. Well I will talk to you later.

      Last night I stayed up till 4 in the morning, and I had to work at 6 in the morning. I actually didnt feel tired till I had to leave, it was at 10:30. It was because I had to stand for the time at work which makes me tired. I am still up as you see and I probably stay up till 1 in the morn. It was kinda weird how I wasn't very tired for the day. I just wanted to tell you guys it. At least I will be able to fall asleep really fast tonight. Well I will try to update more often. It is because I don't have my own computer. That won't be for long. Well I have to go. Keep checkin up on me.
