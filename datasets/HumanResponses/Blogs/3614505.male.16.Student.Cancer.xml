      Yesterday i haf friendly basketball match n my team lose 2 my frenz team. I was so pissed off by my team member because they take it 2 relax liaoz.The other team gt a tall guyz who is my frenz reject some of my frenz ball when they wan 2 shoot or lay up. They play veri well against us n we lack of teamwork that cause us 2 lose e match. I was like e only 1 who runs a lot during e match n i feel so tired. Den we play frm bad 2 worst n i feel like scolding my team member.After e match i gt one frenz said i shoot 9 chances all misses n at that tym i feel lyk scolding him. He thought he is veri pro in bball telling mi wad 2 do. I realli dun lyk his attitude n after leaving e secondary skool i will join an outside team n train den nxt yrs hope tt i can play in e tournament n hope 2 play well. I realli so disappointed at e point after e whole match,we haf lose 25 points 2 my frenz n i feel so disappointed. I will train harder after my N-level n hope 2 play in e tournament nxt yrs....

      Yesterday nitez i watch e euro 2004.It is so boring bcoz portugal lose their opening match against greece.I watch finish e whole match n it is so excited tt i almost scream when portugal finally score frm corner at e 93 mintues.The corner is well taken by figo which set up well by Cristiano Ronaldo(Manchester United Player).He score frm a header which will nt let their fans feel so humiliated when they lose 2 greece.Although they lose 2 greece by 1 goal but i can c tt they had done their best n at the last few minutes they try 2 break e greece defence n they lose a lot of chances 2 score...Well done Portugal n hope u will qualify 4 e group stage
