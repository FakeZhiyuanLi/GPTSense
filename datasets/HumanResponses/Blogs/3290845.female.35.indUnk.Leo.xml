      So, this weekend at  THE WORST JOB IN AMERICA truly sucked!  I have endured about all of the abuse and putdowns and humiliation that I can possibly stand.  I am supposed to be there right now,by the way.  He-He!  I took the day off to go on interviews instead.  God, I hate that place!  I don't think I can go back there, I truly don't.  So anyway, my interview today went really well.  I now have to go on a third interview.  Can you believe it?  Supposedly, this process will eventually end, and they will either hire me or not, but this is driving me insane! I found another job that looks promising, but I can't seem to get my email through.  Grrr!  The level of frustration here is unbelievable!  I have issues!  That is all.

      So okay.  I go on yet ANOTHER interview today, another attempt in my desperate quest to rid myself of THE WORST JOB IN AMERICA.  To add a little more excitement to this brutal experience, today's adventure took me to the local unemployment office, where this particular company chose to hold it's testing session.  Lord help me.  Now I must admit that one of my favorite pastimes is people watching, and the people that I watched today were true originals.  However, I am positivly phobic in my fear of interviews, so people wathing was inturrupted by a God-awful stomach ache, and an inability to, you know, breathe.  Anyway, out of the hundreds of people crammed into this airconditionless, windowless cellblock of a lobby, 24 of them us are hee for my job.  TWENTY FOUR!!  Just as I am deciding that my time wold be better served drowning my sorrows in a double mocha cappichino down the street, they finally call us in to the testing room.  So, there I spend the next two and a half hours test taking.  With twenty four other people.  Who all want MY job.  So, guess what happens?  I PASS!  And I am the only one who passes!  God bless America!  So, while I am rehersing my exit scene from THE WORST JOB IN AMERICA, this unfeeling woman tells me with this enormous smile that I have reached level two of the "selection process".  What the hell?  So, now I have another interview in the same God forsaken place as today, on Monday!  Lord help me!  That is all.

      Things that really piss me off 1.  People who I do not know that touch me.       Okay, not that I have a line of total strangers who are totally dying to touch me, but this happens and it's you know, gross.  If my husband wants to rub my back just because, great.  If my best friend wants to give me an incouraging hug because hubby is acting like Mr. Innapropriate, great!  On the other hand if Mr. Creepy customer puts his arm around me while asking a question, or(this actually happened)pushes my hair out of my face  we have serious issues and Mr. Creepy had better get out of my personal bubble QUICK! 2.People who don't like Bruce Springsteen.      What's up with that?  The Bruce,you know, rocks.  I must admit here that I am from New Jersey, but even if I wasn't Bruce would still rock.  People who cannot grasp this concept are hopeless and not worth my time. 3.People Who never lived in New Jersey, but make Jersey jokes.      How rude!  I was born and raised in Jersey.  I can(and on occasion do) remark on my driving ability,  the amount of toxic waste I have digested in a lifetime,etc.  If you haven't lived there, don't go there,K? 4People that have extensive body odor, but do nothing about it.      Do I have to explain here?  You know who you are my fellow bus riders, and it's gross.  Really. Ewwwww!  Nuf said? 5. People who mistreat animals.      Ok, now this pisses me off on a numbr of levels.  First, it, you know,horrible and sad and sensless.  Second, I am killing myself here trying to stay the militant vegatarian I strive to be, and people are gonna hurt animals for no reason other than science?  Now, corret me if I'm wrong(well actually don't. It's my damn journal) but this just is not right. 6. People who don't understand the eighties.      I know, I know, Reaganomics, the economy, tapered jeans, blagh blagh blagh.  I am not now, nor have I ever been political, and while there were a few unfortunate fashion trends here and there, I loved the eighties.  My daddy was rich, I was young, and I had fantastic hair!  Aside from that the music you know, totally rocked, the parties were better,and life was great.  Wake up people! 7. My job. THE WORST JOB IN AMERICA!!!! 8. My Boss.  THE WORST BOSS IN AMERICA!!! 9. The contact people for possible job oppurtunities.  Oh my hell, how you piss me off!  So overly sweet, so polite, sooo helpful.  So calling me a pathetic loser as soon as you hang up!  (Paranoid? Maybe) 10.  Ok, let's just get this out there.  People basically piss me off!   That is all.

      This is so cool!  I have never done anything like this before.  Just another day in my quest for a new job.  I absolutely cannot go on working at Walmart anymore.  I don't care what I have to do, but I will get out of there one way or another.  They seriously need to learn how to treat people and maybe they wont have such problems keeping associates.  One year is enough for me thank you very much.  So anyway no word yet from JHFCU, but I am keeping my fingers crossed for tomorrow.  On Wednesday I have a test scheduled for another bank, but I really REALLY want JH.  Guess thats all for now.   Jenna
