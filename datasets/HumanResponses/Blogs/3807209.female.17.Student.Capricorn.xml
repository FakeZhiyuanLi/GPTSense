      Oh my gosh... so like I finally have one of these for my own! Whopee... the technologically challenged has her own website. This rox! Anyways.. So YEC was this past weekend. What a blast!!! I had so much fun being totally off the wall and crazy. Leslie- girl you are just too much!! Hooking me up!! How funny is that???? Salvador was so awesome but they only got to play like four songs since the conference had run so long.. how sad is that???? Oh well, at least I got to see them! Did I mention they are the greatest Latin band like ever??? And Mario- I promise it's all about the music!! Tee hee. Anyways, this week has been pretty slow so far... lots of things are going on and I'm just waiting to see how it all will turn out. God give me some patience!! I really need your help right now, lol! I'll let yall know when more interesting stuff comes up.. I think that's really all for right now. Later yall....

      Wow- what a vacation. Got to relax, chill at Fiesta Texas (oh yeah- my skin apparently has two shades: white and lobster... currently I am definately lobster!!! But that's what I get for refusing to wear sunscreen!), wander around the riverwalk, shop a little, etc. It was just cool- but I seriously missed being around this past weekend! Oh well... whats done is done. Anyways, so camp is coming up... and apparently I am going- Johanna is awfully persuasive!! (there were threats!!) :-) Lol- not really, and besides I do wanna go.. I think it'll be a cool time.   Ahhhhh, summer!! I'm loving it! Everything is going so well! I mean, just everything in my life is finally all falling into place at the right time- Jesus, You are so awesome!!Thank you for all that you've taught me in the last couple of weeks and thank you for the people I've met and the places I have gone. Help me to keep growing in you!   I think that the whole patience thing is really coming along well- He is teaching me and for once I am acutally getting what He's trying to do! Not that I think that I totally understand the mind of God or anything but yeah- I think I am understanding what He is doing individually in this area of my life. And if I do say so myself, the growth lately has been fantastic! Ahhhh- I'm feeling His presence and it is awesome!  Anyways, Mario- I know you probably dont read these but...... I am so gonna call you UTURN forever!!! And there is no way I am going to tell you what I got you from San Antonio-- you'll just have to wait! Leslie- girl, only 5 days left! HA ha ha... and camp is going to rock! Mario, I can't believe you cant go! You're so going to miss out!! Lol- Kait, San Antonio was tooooooo crazy- we should do that more often!  Ahhhhhhh I am tired... worked way tooo long today- need sleep! I'll let yall know more later! :-) Tee hee hee!

      So this weekend is July 4th and all right.. and Rhoda had a bunch of stuff planned at NDFC- so why the heck is my family taking their first Independence weekend trip this year???? There is finally stuff to do here for the 4th and we're leaving!! Argh... oh well- at least I get to go to the picnic tonight. That should be fun even though there is no  !!!freaking!!!  way  anyone  (that includes you Mario!!!) is going to get me to play volleyball no matter how much begging or pleading (or bribing) goes on. I hate volleyball!! Probably has something to do with that time I almost broke my nose- I am permanently scarred!  Anyways, I was reading this book the other night, about Tamar (the woman in the Bible who tricked Jacob into sleeping with her so that she could rightfully bear the son she owed to Jacob's dead firstborn son- her husband Er, who died... got that? Confusing story really!!! You can find it in Genesis, chapters 37 and 38) and about how she converted from the faith of her fathers and believed in the Lord God of Isreal. The Lord honored her conversion by allowing one of her sons to be a direct anscestor of Jesus Christ!! How awesome is that?? God used a once pagan woman to bear one of the great-great (on and on and on!!) grandfathers of our Savior!! Just goes to show how the Lord honors those who are faithful and who cling to His Will!! His timing is always perfect... I really need to remember that one! Sometimes its hard to be patient though- I mean, there are things going on right now that I really feel like should happen and I desperately want direction and guidence from the Lord, but I feel like God is just waiting until I am still. Why cant I be still???? :)   Oh well- at least I am trying!! Anyways, I should probably get back to packing... long ways to go on that one! I'm only gonna be gone from Saturday till Monday afternoon and yet I am packing like a trunkful of stuff- I really need to simplify!! Sometimes I can be such a girl! Tee hee... I am gonna miss everyone while I am gone!!! Les- only 8 days left.. you go girl! Mario~ I promise never to throw a chankla at you... at least not intentionally (you know how bad my aim is!! ;-) Kait, girl.. you're so cra-z! What are you writing in your blog that I cant see... oooo I am so gonna tell on you! (just kidding!) Lizzie- We've got to get together!! Start returning my phone calls when I am actually at home! We play wayyyyy too much phone tag, lol! Bonnie: what's the deal??? I have no clue what I did but whatever it was, I'm sorry!! Call me!! Ummmmm- yeah, that's basically it. Peace, im out!

           Okay!!! Today was totally awesome... I couldn't have asked for a better time! I got to sleep in this morning, did my chores on my own without people crowding around me and fighting (ie. Kait and Alex!!!), went to the store, picked up my last steady paycheck from my  stupid  old job, hung out with Mario and got coffee (oh my gosh we talked for such a long time!!!!- it was like 3 hours or so!!!) had an awesome time with him!! and then I went out with my mom and got dinner then ice cream (from my favorite place: MARBLE SLAB!!! SWEET CREAM IS THE BESTEST!!) Oh and Mario got me this  reallly  cool photo book of whales (my favorite animals!)... they're so beautiful!! So Mario, if you're reading this, you rock in my book! Totally cool (again- theoretically speaking since I really dont have a book!! tee hee). Les- we so gotta do something huge for your birthday!!! It's upon us.. ten days and the clock is ticking- like I said, what do you want for it? (besides True Vine- Mario already promised you that one!)      God you are soooooo amazing! I cannot even begin to tell You how much You mean to me! Thank you for bringing me into relationship with You and thank you for drawing me closer to You this past weekend and week- You mean more to me than any other earthly thing! Show me the way that I should go! I really just want to know You and to seek Your face with all of my heart and strength! Show me Your ways and hide Your Words in my heart that I may not sin against You! Reveal any offensive way in me... I am so open to whatever You have in store!! Your Ways are so awesome, so amazing.... I cannot even comprehend why You bother with me! Help me not to disappoint You Jesus!        Anyways............... sooooo sleepy! I should probably turn in- feeling like an old lady!! It's only like 11:00 for goodness sakes!Where is alll my spunk... I think it melted away in the HEAT!!!!!! Now I remember why I cant bear Texas summers..... must find somewhere cooler! Or else I'm gonna end up like the wicked witch of the west- nothing more than a puddle! Tee hee hee- okay, peace.. I am so outta here!  "Veni, vidi, vici." I came, I saw, I conquered. -Julius Ceaser
