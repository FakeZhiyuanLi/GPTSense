      I've been thinking recently about life, the universe and everything. It's pretty scary stuff. A while ago I did a "Negotiated study" on time travel and such matters as black holes and the multiverse theory. I don't have time tonight but when I get the chance I'll post 'em up for all intested.

      It's funny what kids pick up from their parents. Tonight Zali, my mothers old flat-mate, came over for dinner with her two children. After dinner we sliced up the cake they had brought. Hugo, on of her kids, insisted that he wanted a green strawberry, after his mother's failed attempts at telling him they didn't exist, I told him that the kiwifruit was really a strawberry. He then demanded to have his strawberry washed so he could eat it. It really made me smile.  I think I've changed my mind about having kids, they're so much fun. I even sat down with them and made a llama out of lego with them. I then continued to make a tree and a shrub for the llama, all of which are now proudly perched on the kitchen mantle piece.  "Oh teach me how not to think" Romeo, from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Sometimes I wish that I didn't think so much. I know it sounds stupid but I seem to be constantly analyzing things. Take for example, years 6,7,8. During this time I did not know who I was. I'm sure you've all heard the phrase "Just be yourself". What if you do not know what is you, and what is not. What does a person compare to in this kind of situation.  Humans are very reliant on what is normal. Take for example, your mother. Now you would say, she is what all mothers are like, other peoples mothers are just other mothers, but yours is the real type of mum. The thing is, we don't have anything else to compare to, so well take that which we experience and call it normal. For some, ideas of normal can be inherited. Homophobia is a great example of this. Many parents are homophobic also pass it on to their children.   "The human mind can not stand too much reality" It's amazing how true this is, we see all the deaths in Iraq and other countries and lay there, lifeless, waiting for the next episode of friends to burst into our living-rooms. I guess it all boils down to what you want out of life. You see a poor man freezing on the street on a cold, rainy winters night, you can either walk past him and think nothing of it, give him a few loose coins to make yourself feel not so bad or take him in, get him rugged up and find a place where he can stay.  I was out in town the other day and passed a lady selling magazines to help raise money to save the forests. There seemed to be a general way the people would react, they would either walk as far away from here as possible or look intently at the pavement. The dismissal of guilt it really unhealthy, how can a person really be asked "could you please help save Tasmania's old growth forests?" and shake their head, they'd rather spend their money on some nice food for dinner tonight, or a new hair colour.  "Truth needs no laws to support it. Throughout history, only liars and lies resort the courts to mandate belief."  Even if it's just to make someone's day. Give them something to talk about "guess what happened today..."  Finish that sentence for someone, anyone. Don't de it because of guilt, but because you want to.  Go do something amazing today...  ~Paul

      Ok, it seems that I'm gaining a lot of new friends in recent times, and hopefully, after going to this party on the 30th, I'll have a whole bunch of new friends. The real reason I felt inspired enough to write this blog is because of Grace. She's a friend of Chris and it seems whenever one of her friends meets a gay guy or lesbian they immediately say, "oh, you've gotta meet my friend Grace". Grace is kind of one of those people that you always wished were your older sister, the moment I met her I though "friend for life". I know it sounds stupid, but some things just come to you, you know it's right. Take Chris and I meeting for example, we both knew just about straight away that each other were gay. Chris really "loves" her and I think I'm on my way to "loving" her too.  Just another thing, the other day I bought a pack of twisties, after careful examination of the pack I found the words "life's pretty straight without..." I've yet to find a good end to that but I think with a little work we could make something quite cool. English involved a moderation test today, we had not a pop-quiz, but a pop-essay! We had to analyze a photo, I must say I really enjoy analyzing people and how they act but a one page essay is too much to ask :p  There are a few homophobic guys at our school, some worse than others. Jeremy is one of them. While practicing our cha-cha routine in lunch, Jeremy walked in to discover Kate and I zooming around the floor to really fast dace music. The expression on his face was one that deserved a photo and frame.  ~Paul

      Sorry I haven't posted for ages, but I think I've finally found an 'outlet' for my feelings. His name is Chris, he's 18 and goes to  Guilford Young college. How we first met was really quite amusing, I was on work experience at his dad's work, Nexus. The job itself was pretty boring but when I met him I was like, wow, these kind of people really exist. I was squealing inside with joy. Later on, after I'd left the workplace, I e-mailed him to soon find out that he was also gay. The result of his reply was a huge grin on my face for the next two days :D.  I'm now going to a post-exam dinner with chris, his boyfriend, grace (the "crazy lesbian") and a whole bunch of other gay guys and girls. I think I've finally found my place in the world, I haven't had a 'bad' day since. I feel kind of strange because he and all his friends are 17/18 and I'm only 16 but they all seem really nice, and in the end, that's what counts.  Oh, another thing. Last night at latin dance a guy came in. Brown and beige shirt, first 3 buttons undone at top, silver necklace. Bleached jeans at the front and black formal shoes. He had blonde hair that was 'oh so very gay' :p Turned out that he was checking me out for quite a while when I was dancing with kate, or so Bridget tells me. He was very cute but I think a little to cute for me.  LIFE IS GREAT!!!  Can't stand life without dance at school, quitting foods and swapping back to dance instead.Latin comp is coming up soon at wrest point casino, it's gonna be really big.  ~Paul

      I finished my work experience at the Theatre Royal today. It was fantastic, if there is one bit of advise that every person should take it's to not set boundaries, heck, I was applying for a job on the spirit of tasmania, a cruise ship down here in Australia. I'm 16 and applying for a job on a high-class cruise ship. Forget what's acceptable, what is normal for your age, go out and reach for what you want, what do you have to lose. The stuff I got to do at The Theatre Royal was average, but just being there was fantastic. I guess I've gone there in the past and I've seen magic, I've seen people become who they are not, seen the impossible. To be there, right where they stood, where that magic came from nothing. I guess it's not the actual theatre that I'm attracted to, it's the people, it just amazes me that they can transform themselves to someone that doesn't exist. And all the backstage people are just so happy, all the time, yeah it's stressful, but what job isn't.  I say, go live your life, no-ones gonna stop you. Reach for what you want, forget about "keeping your options open". Each person has an average of 4 career changes in their life, if you don't like what you're doing, quit the job, go find something fun, something that you love. If you really want to do something, they will hire you, if you truly believe that you can do this, and if you really want it, The people will see that. I have never prepared for an interview, I figure, they're interviewing me, not some, "here's one I prepared earlier" kinda person.  And hey, you may think, oh, he thinks he's so good at writing all this junk, so be it, I do not care if you think either way, because, frankly, this is me, this is who I am and this is what I believe. Those who like me, thanx for taking the time to read, for those who don't, the same to you.     Go be you, forget about what people might think. Say hi to every person you meet, it may be the only chance you get. Live life and go for what you want.

      After going for work experience at the theatre Royal yesterday, I was waiting for my dad to pick me up. A lady, who seemed to be in her 30's was standing infront of me, it appeared she was waiting for someone too. Generally I'm not a very outgoing kinda guy, it made me think about what would happen if I did say "Hello".  So the conversation began in my head "Hello" "Hi" "You waiting for someone too?" "Do I know you?" "Well, no, but I figure that we don't really have that long on this earth in the scheme of things so I've decided to talk to everyone, that way I wont miss out on all the great people I never met. I mean yeah, there are gonna be the nasty ones, but that's the case everywhere in life, you just have to deal with 'em and get on with life."  I got about this far when my dad came in the car :p I'll post up some pictures of the Theatre royal when I get home tonight, it's truly an amazing place.

      This is a little poem that I wrote a while ago in english, the idea was  to base it on a character from the book "Sleeping Dogs". The person I  studied was a quite insane and depressed character who spent most of  her time staring at her teapot.  Searching  I am always searching Looking for that underlying meaning What is it for which I search? Searching for an answer, a purpose, for someone to tell me what to do? Questions, questions, always questions. And so here I sit, removed from this world, separated from all the  material world, A mindless bliss. The isolation is like millions of  ants, consuming me in my place,  carrying me away to the void of spirits. I used to search for love, I found it, and then it bit me Quick Fast Sharp My body still scars, that night the voices returned In my head they moan, ‘Go, leave, die!’ They will never go, I know it I want to scratch them out of my head, but I know I can not I have a haven, I place I can go The shining symbol of what was My teapot still sits, high on the shelf It silences the voice For I must not leave for fear of him coming back, the voice inside me will not go For only at death will we part  Paul Yarnall

      Well,  where to start. I'm gay, I like rice, having fun and walks in the park. I suppose I figured out I was gay after I started looking at guys a lot more in high school. My friend Kate and I do latin dance together (latin dancing guy, oh how very gay :p) it's very up close and personal and quite touchy-feely,what's cool is, she has a boyfriend and I feel nothing for her.   Today at lunchtime my friend Liz was talking about how she was so 'buff'. I quoted "No one likes buff chicks" She replied with "some people don't even like chicks"  I also got a GMail account today, if anyone wants one too post a comment with your current e-mail  ~Paul

      Well, where to start, his name is Gideon to start. Here's an e-mail he sent me: "noone but a crazy person could see the good in me :)... but, I can't say I'm not flattered....you are always beating your own personal (and world) records for how nice a person can be....I'm serious, until I met you I thought it was humanly possible to be so nice. You constantly outdo yourself....how you manage it, I'll never know."  He's a great guy and I'll miss him heaps when he goes, if you see him around go and give him a huge hug, he deserves it :p  I guess what I really admore about him is his outlook on life, his sense of fun and just the way he goes about everything. Cheers to you , Gideon  ~Paul

      Even as I write this I know, sub-conciosly, that he may read this. He, is amazing. So much so that I do not know how to express my admiration for him. For some reason I have this everlasting desire to do things for him. I know it sounds crazy, almost stalker-like, but he’s just so great, and I, well I’m not. I guess in a sense I want to be like him but at the same time I want to be part of what he does. I’ve never had an idol, now, I think I do.

      Isn’t it a great thought, that someone, somewhere out there, cares about what you think.   The thought comes to every person when they hit that “create blog” button for the first time. ‘What if people really like what I write?’. ‘Maybe I’ll have people checking my blog site everyday to see if I’ve posted’. The lack of judgment on appearance and looks there is just what they think and write. For some this idea seems fantastic, a place where everyone likes you, just for you. I guess we’re all searching for that place. When all the world is so full of ideas and rules on how you should walk, talk, look, smell. It’s so full of guidelines and ways of going about doing things. To not follow these, social rules, leads to being called strange, weird, freak. A place where there are no boundaries, no limitations, truly this must be paradise.

      A post I've been meaning to put here for a while concerns toilet paper.  I recently discovered a strongly scented roll of toilet paper in our downstairs bathroom. Lavender! I don't quite understand the marketing logic behind such things, I mean really, is it supposed to feel good having a lovely smelling bit of paper covered in stinking human excrement. Perhaps it is to flush with the comfort that, when that little piece of you go's down the toilet, it will be in good smelling company, as such a comfort your poop could not go without.

      Picture this: 	Since you were small you always knew you were different, you didn’t know in what way or why, you just knew. During your school years people would call you names and pick on you, for reasons you didn’t know. One day a kid comes up to you and calls you gay. You think “wow maybe this is why I’ve had these feelings”. For the longest time you feel unhappy, depressed, and oh so very confused. But you decide that you like the gay people, the gay culture, it’s where you feel welcome. Imagine if one day, someone came and said, no this can’t go on any longer. The sadness came back, slowly, but surely. This... is my mother, it could be the ‘leaving the nest’ theory or that failing sense of control. But I do know this, my mum is keeping me from my friends that I love dearly.  On saturday night the most amazing thing happened, it was a huge realisation for me: We had all decided it was time for bed at about 3 am, we all just broke off into groups, each to their own: Gracie and Guck, Chris and Richard etc. Because I didn’t have any other options, I slept on the floor (well, a mattress really, but it was pretty close to the floor anyway). Turned out that this was where Rohan was also sleeping. We kind of just lay there for a while on our backs until I turned my back to him and he laid on his side. Shortly after I felt a hand resting on my body, I slowly reached across and, after stroking his hand for a short while, held it and brought it over my body, we were now very close. His movements seemed so soft and beautiful, I would clutch his hand tightly and he would respond with a gentle touch and he would stroke my fingers. Soon he was right up next to me, skin to skin, his front to my back, it was amazing. It seemed he shifted a little when I stroked his hand, as if to give me the signal that he was enjoying it. After an hour he turned over and I followed. I lay my hand softly on his hips, he gently picked up my hand and ran it across his chest, coming to an end at his nipple. The morning came, and it was all over,  during the night, not a word was spoken, and now, this remained true. I suppose I was nervous to say this before for fear of criticism and judgement, but I still wondered if I was gay or not, even when I had come out. There was always that sense of ‘what if’. This night with Rohan confirmed all that I had hoped, I like guys, and that’s a fact.  Sometimes I wish that I didn’t have  a family, my brother being homophobic, my mother being over protective. Right now I feel like just going to sleep and forgetting all of this, but sadly, the reality is that when I wake up, my life will still be the same, my mother will still be over protective, my brother homophobic. Sometimes I only bother becuase of my friends, and to find that meaning I’ve been searching for. Call me stupid, but I’m very short sighted when it comes to life.   “If people were able to learn from the experiences of others 100% fully, then most teenagers wouldn’t do many things that they do” Yvonne Woodward  In my oppinion parents should lighten up, their kids wont stay forever, no matter how hard they try, and ultimatly, they can’t tell their children what to do. Take for example this situation: Susi, your daughter wants to go to a party tonight at 10 pm. There will be alchahol and there is a good chance someone will get laid during the evening. You can a) stop her then she will creep out later on, or b) Say ok but give here some guidlines and suggestions, rather than rules.
