						   Summer has kind of set into a routine now.  I have work about 4 days a week and am finishing up my training in the kitchen.  It's really not new and exciting anymore.  Today was the 3rd day of my pastel class and its fun; my great-grandfather is looking more like himself everyday.  Who knew a little brown worked better for shading on a face than black?  I didnt. Anyway, I'm seeing a little less of my friends now that i have a job, but its ok.  I have an income which is not overrated.  Still up late, though not quite as late b/c I dont want to be too tired for class tomorrow.  Good Night, Afternoon, Morning, or w/e.

						   I have now worked a total of 4 days, and decided that work is not nearly as hard as i once believed.  I dunno, bussing is much easier than cooking, that's for damn sure; better money with the tips too.  Anyway, work is gettin more fun as i know more people and im enjoying it more.  I'm sucking up all the hours i can too.  Starting a portrait class tomorrow at 9:00 (today) and it should be fun; i wanna learn how to draw people.  Playing the guitar still, always fun, and waiting for snowboarding season (long way off). Until then, i will chill, staying up late just because i can.

						   Do you like the name of the header?  I seemed appropriate for such a short post.  Started work today. It was hard, so I must be soft or something.  Anyway, I'm bushed. Goodnight.

						    Yeah, so i decided that at 4:30 in the morning, it would be fun to write a post.  Why not right?  Well, i just posted on barb's blog, the only other blog i know, and will pray for a comment.  I think i will wait here in front of my computer until that time, refreshing every 5 minutes or so. Actually i have senior pictures--well, today i guess--at 2:00.  Better get to bed... its only 8 1/2 hours away....

						   Yeah, so i made this blog specifically for the purpose of posting a comment on barb's blog.  I have no intention of making any more posts, unless i get really bored or find people to communicate with through this.  Anyway, thanks for reading, you're probably the only one.

						   Well, Barb's last&nbsp;comment has dragged a post out of me, so here goes:&nbsp;&nbsp;My work takes up most of my days, but when I'm off I have been hanging out with Michael, Kevin, Amanda, Jenny, and Abby, but the group varies sometimes.&nbsp; I never really knew Kevin Pozzi before, but hanging out with him has been cool, and everyone else has accepted me pretty willingly into their activities.&nbsp; It's fun.&nbsp; Michael still has relationship issues which plague his social life (and a few of ours too) but he's doing well overall and everyone has a great time bowling, playing/listening to music, swimming, etc etc.&nbsp; As far as work goes, im getting to know the people their quite a bit better, and i went to a party with some of them and Nat, and we had a blast.&nbsp; 12 player HALO (video game barb) is kick ass.&nbsp; I got a 25 cent raise after about a month of working there and im told im doing well, so i guess work is good overall.&nbsp; This weekend (starting today actually) is my family campout in East Jordan MI for the weekend and that will be a blast.&nbsp; Im kinda bummed at how fast summer has gone by with work and hanging out with my friends.&nbsp; School starts i think the 20th (?) and I cant believe all this has to change.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin will go back to Wisconsin and homework will be back with a vengeance.&nbsp; Major bullshit.&nbsp; O well, live in the moment i guess.&nbsp; Thanks for reading, and ill make an attempt at least to post more often than i have been.&nbsp;

						   I was going to write about the ups and downs of the Catholic School System, but i figured I would wait until the school year starts for that one.  You know, so the wounds are fresh and not yet cauterized.  Right now I will go into the excruciating details of work today.  I worked DMO (basically a dishwasher)  today and it was long.  I swear two or three times i would look at the clock and then again 45 minutes later, and it said the same thing both times.  I would pray that it was at least 9 or 9:30, but the clock read 8.  Tonight, that clock made enemies with a certain Hacienda employee.  I finally got out around 12:30 and smelled, you know, wonderful.  All I want right now is a shower, but I think ill wait until tomorrow....before work.  Yes that's right, I look forward to the same experience tomorrow.  Same time, same place, what a joy.

						   After a post of such passion and direction, I find myself unable to pick a new topic to write about. There are no conflicts or troubling realizations at my mind's doorstep, and my creative writer's side desperately seeks a subject. The social problems that have been raging around me have subsided for now, and as I sit in this chair typing, I find a sense of peace has replaced the constant anxious limbo of who will end up with who. Minor problems have arisen (I have to wash dishes today and tomorrow at work, not pleasant, and my friends of the female persuasion are temporarily barred from spending the night at my house) but these will be dealt with and discarded, like most everything else. I still have not broken my habit of staying up late (its 7:30 am right now), which could prove to be yet another difficulty in the coming weeks with school ahead. Right now my school schedule looks like this:  Hour Semester Course 1 1 AP Calculus H 1 2 AP Calculus H  2 1 Study Hall 2 2 American Government  3 1 Honors Physics 3 2 Honors Physics  4-5 1 Drawing 1 4-5 2 Drawing 2  6 1 Lunch 6 2 Lunch  7-8 1 American Literature/English Language Composition AP 7-8 2 ....Same thing  9 1 Great Catholic Thinkers (...yay) 9 2 Catholic Church History  10 1 Honors Economics 10 2 Media Arts 1  Whew, lots o' typing. I guess there is somekind of schedule conflict because i should have Media Arts 1/2 over the course of the year, but for some reason it wouldnt fit. Drawing will be a blast, especially with the drawing teacher at Marian HS. Calc 1st hour will absolutely suck, and the religion classes are always a joy... they definitely need to make those electives. I guess i found something to write about next post huh? The trials and tribulations of the Catholic School System. Well, until I post again, adieu.

						   The title of this blog has never been more true than it is right now. While I love reading up on my friends lives, I'm getting tired of how damn depressing everything is. Where are the fun and lively bunch I know? I read these blogs full of emotion and pain and think of how this is all relationship caused. They have problems I dont have, and they seem completely and utterly crushed by them. One of my friend's problems are so great that I mourn for him, because he once had love, but has now lost it. He looks for it again with others, but remembers the good times he had with "her" and tries to go back, regardless of how unforgivable her actions. I look forward to one day having someone to walk with, talk with, be with, even raise children with, but is this what relationships are really like? Would my life with someone be so riddled with fights and nasty comments? Pain? I look at my mother, who has no one except me. I see her relationships and what went wrong in them, how her faults as a person have presented problems. But how can a 17 year old, her own child, tell her what she is doing wrong? I see my dad, and the things about him that drove mom away. But then I see how he found someone to be with, and I look at the good aspects of their relationship. I want that laughter and banter someday with my wife. I look at how well my extended family gets along, but even my grandmother (who has more class, yes class, than anyone I know) had to put up with immense difficulties from my grandfather (may he rest in peace). So many problems, and all of them seem insurmountable. Then I read stories about the power of love. The love is perfect, and the problems are small and insignificant when compared with the ones of the real people I care about. How is love supposed to go? Can the faults of a person be fixed, like the man with a temper problem? Can the woman who is weak willed be made to be strong enough to stand on her own? Can the feeling of love between two people be so great as to counter all negative... everything, for time as great as a lifetime? What faults can love live with, and what is too wrong to be ignored? Now that is a question.   To any of my friends who I have attempted to give advice to: I hope the first few lines of this post do not lead you to think this is a complaint about you "griping" to me about your problems. I enjoy lending help and whatever else people need, whenever they need it. I am glad you have trusted me with your private feelings so I could listen and try to ameliorate. I feel honored and thank you for thinking enough of me as a friend to bring your troubles to me.
