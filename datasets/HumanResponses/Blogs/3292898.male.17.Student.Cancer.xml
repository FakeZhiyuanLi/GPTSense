      Today was pretty cool. My classes were all easy, it went by fairly quick, and because of the constant raining, I didn't have to go to the Exit to do more Community service. A guy up there gave me the hours anyways, too. I wonder how long it's going to keep raining, there IS a flash flood warning, so it could get ugly. Maybe it will be all dark tomorrow morning like it was today, that was pretty sweet. Glad tomorrow is Friday, too; it's about time for this week to end. And of course there's the  huge  game of Halo going on at my house at 6:30...should be 16 people if everyone shows up. And damnit, don't you just hate it when you've got feelings for someone that doesn't have feelings for you? It's just pointless and degrading. Matches with the gloomy mood the weather gives off. Anyways, I smell tacos, so that's my cue to leave. Peace eses.

      So I just got back from doing 3 hours of "community service" at the Exit. More like 2 and a half hours, but the guy let us off early. It was actually kind of fun. Atif, Dan, Josh, and Monica came to do service too (they have the same project.) We played volleyball most of the time, and then went inside. Me, Atif, and Monica chatted while Josh and Dan played some ATV game on the PS2. I still think the project is a waste of time, but its beats the alternate assignment (reading Red Storm Rising by Tom Clancy...about 720 pages long.) And it all ended with me getting Whataburger, which I never get tired of. The chicken tenders don't taste fake and spongy, the fries are topped only by McDonald's, and the drinks are  ginormous . Yeah, it's kinda expensive, and you always end up waiting like 10 minutes, but it's all worth it. And that's about it kids, be sure to show this one to your math teacher:

      Anyone else ready for school to be out? Two weeks plus finals left, and I have two history projects to do. One, me and a partner have to teach the class a lesson because Mrs. Krinhop is too much of a  lazy whore  to do it herself. Two, we have 10 hours of community service due Friday. That means I get to spend a few days after school at the Exit. I just can't get over how much I hate history...almost as much as I hate Spanish. And speaking of Spanish, Longoria has us watching everyone's favorite Spanish soap opera, Destinos, every day in class (even though we've already taken the final and AP Test.) He's such a bastard. Other than that I suppose school is bearable, but I'm still ready for summer. As Joseph so nicely put it, "It's gonna be so awesome! Sex, beer, friends...minus the sex and beer." Amen to that.    And I'll end it with a laugh:

         So I just got back from Best Buy (it's almost as if I live there) and I decided to go ahead and buy The Boondock Saints. Now, for $9.99, I felt it was a good deal, considering the cost to rent two movies from Blockbuster is almost that much anyways. Besides, the movie is just plain badass. If you've never seen it, the movie follows two Irish brothers (Connor and Murphy), strung together by religion and brotherhood, as they do what they believe is God's will by killing off criminals and mobsters.    Connor MacManus: These decent men with loving families, they go home every day after work, and turn on the news and you know what they see? They see rapists and murderers and child molestors and they're all getting' out of jail.  Murphy MacManus: "Mafiosos," getting' caught with 20 kilos, getting' out on bail. Same fucking day.  Connor MacManus: And everyone, everywhere thinks the same thing: that someone should just go kill those mother fuckers.  Murphy MacManus: Kill 'em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.   They're Irish... what more could you want? If you've never seen it, definitely check it out. Also, I recently got a Ben Kweller and The Blood Brothers CD. Pretty awesome, check 'em out if you're into that sort of thing.
