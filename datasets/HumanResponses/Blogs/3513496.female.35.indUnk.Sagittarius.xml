      I called my Dad today to wish him a Happy Father's Day.  I had a pleasant conversation, not too many awkward pauses.  He asked me if I got the email he had sent that morning about the piece I did for the disability protest artshow.  I hadn't checked my email yet...that guy is so slow.  I sent him that picture ages ago.  Whatever.   He told me he liked the piece but that like all modern art it needed some explanation.  This made me feel silly about a comment I made to Thirza the other day, about how I didn't like performance art because unless it was explained to me, or I got to read supporting materials, I generally didn't get it.  Whatever.  The Art World seems so crazy sometimes....so much hoopla about images or actions.  (I liked Tom Wolfe's "The Painted Word", a book criticizing the mystique of modern art.) I got to hear his step-grandchild Sarah yapping on the phone.  She's 3, sounded so sweet trying to say my name.  She just got a baby brother Brandon so she's all excited about that too.  I'm jealous.  I wish I had a family.  That's my one regret.  I had an abortion when I was 18 and I wonder sometimes how different my life would be if I would have kept the baby instead.  It's not like I did anything special with my life, I didn't go to school, at least I didn't get a degree.  I spent most of my life being depressed and hiding from the world.  Not all the time, but a good chunk of it.  If I had a kid, I'd have had to do more....probably I'd have just made the kid's life miserable with my craziness though.  I dunno.  It's probably best not to think in terms of what could have been.  The other day Joe and I had a conversation about why neither of us want to get jobs.  He put it in terms of the game tiddly winks.  He said society says "you should be playing tiddly winks, everybody else does it", but you've played tiddly winks before and it didn't make you happy.   Both Joe and I are shy people with social anxiety disorders.  At times I haven't left the apartment for weeks because I was too freaked out to go outside and see people.  He thinks that the most important thing in both our lives is feeling safe and secure.  This means having to interact with as few people as possible...meaning NO JOB!  I do volunteer work occasionally but that's when I want to and feel up to it.  It's low pressure and it's only at my convenience.  I remember working full time and it was hell.  Everyday I HAD to be at work, doing the same thing, day in, day out.  I wanted to die.  PLUS I had to talk to people all the time.  I exaggerate, but not much.  Being depressed and working is rough.  Maybe one day I will want to work again, but I doubt it.  I think I will always be a poor person.  My best option would be to be on a higher level of disability than I am now, then I could make money at a part time job.  I wouldn't mind working a couple shifts a week.  I could handle that.   So anyhow, the most important thing in my life is feeling secure, not having to interact with strangers, like sometimes before I have a volunteer shift, or a doctor's appointment I can't sleep.  I know if I had to work again, I would be flipping out.  I'd go mental I bet.  Maybe I could do it with my new meds, but maybe not.  I don't know that I'd want to try.  In any case Joe and I have learned to survive on very little.  Reduced needs = No car, No mortgage. We gets da welfare, which basically pays the rent and bills and we sells some movies on ebay and that makes it so we aren't totally starving.  I make a bootleg buspass.  We both go to the foodbank, and he uses a fake ID to get more food. We go to the free sandwich place when we need to and the crazy place for free meals on Fridays.  We rarely pay for haircuts.  Never buying expensive anything....think ghetto all the way....just generally living in a way that most middleclass people and even working class people whose income meets their needs just couldn't comprehend.  All this so I can live a life of leisure feeling safe and secure, not having to be around people.  It's not so bad being poor.  You just have to be crazy enough to endure the poverty.

      Today I went and bought some beastie boys CDs for ebay sales, hadn't done that in ages, listed any cd's that is.  It was like old times being in Future Shop looking at the racks.  I felt like a reformed addict looking at all the wares for sale remembering how I used to have such lust for all the stuff.  I don't seem to have such a desire for media anymore. I don't even want the movies I have.  I'm letting Joe tape over all my taped stuff for the movies we sell on ebay.  Too bad I wasn't doing that last year when I still had the account that sold all the pirated movies, my pile of  tapes would be much more seriously depleted than it is.  That's one of my goals now, to not have so many movies.  You CAN have too much of a good thing.  Next step is selling the non taped movies. I'm more attached to those, since they are supposedly of more value since they aren't bootlegged, but really what are those rectangular chunks of plastic and magnetic tape really worth?  Very little.  I could throw them away and be totally free of the burden of owning them all together.  That sounds so tempting, but I'm too poor to be that irresponsible with a product I could turn into cash.  Meh.  I guess I should jess be sassified with WATCHING movies, not owning them.  I know I like watching some movies over and over, but many I would never want to see again, in fact many of them I've never even watched.   Last night Joe and I went to see WILBUR WANTS TO KILL HIMSELF, a film I wanted to see at the VIFF last year, but was just too worn out with all the flicks I was seeing and all the shifts I was doing volunteering.  It was good, not something I'd want to own, but a good movie.  It was so different from the Hollywood stuff we've been going to with the airmiles coupons.  The last 2 were the new Harry Potter then we snuck into The Day After Tomorrow,  I didn't even write about them, because what can I say, not much.  Entertaining, but you don't really learn much or I dunno I slam hollywood as a matter of course.  I'm a film snob and I admit it.  I prefer little indie movies to big blockbusters, but I'll go to big blockbusters 'cause I gots coupons fer dem and I'll  bitch about them but I love going to movies even when they're shitty.  Tonight I'ma go see THE STEPFORD WIVES...

      today I gots me a haircut.  I wanted to get it cut real short, like a brush cut, but it was hard to get the hairdresser to do it. I told her I wanted a boy cut, a like a modified mullet, turned out she didn't know what a mullet was. She cut it twice, I didn't feel like asking her to cut it a third time so I left it at that. It's spiking up pretty good though so I'm pretty happy with it. Joe said I looked like a baby chick when I got done with my fluffy hair. I didn't like how the hairdresser had moussed up my hair at first, all big and Dolly Parton like,  so I wore a hat.   I've been talking about having short hair for a while. It feels good to finally have it hacked off.  The nice thing about short hair is you can change your style very easily, one cut grows out quickly.  I got my eyes looked at. The diabeets is not making me blind yet. Hooray for that.   I watched Chopper. That guy was a pyscho. I wish Joe would get a haircut like him.   He got a haircut too, but he didn't look any different when he came out.  I asked him if he even got a haircut.  I want him to shave his head ya know.  I totally love guys that have short short hair, or bald heads.  It looks so tough.

      Here I am waiting for Joe to make his omelette so we can finish watching 21 grams.  So far I don't really like this movie much. It's a downer.  Thirza was over watching it with us but she got sleepy and had to go home.  We had a giggle at the DVD store looking at the porn, found stuff that seemed to be beastiality.  I asked the clerk about it, because I was pretty sure bestiality is illegal, he said yeah, it's just straight sex with a farm theme.  He said you'd have to go to Mexico to get the "real" stuff.  You don't have to go to Mexico, you just need to use Kazaa.  I've found beastiality on there.  It's pretty gross.  I think the attraction in beastiality is these girls are so horny, they'll screw anything!!  I don't really understand that fetish.  ooo...Joe is done.  time to finish the rest of the movie.

      Today I did a shift at Gallery Gachet.  I started the process of becoming a member about a year ago, but had lost interest.  Last night I went to an opening and when I met Diane, the member who had been training me, I told her I wanted to start coming in again.  She said tomorrow is my day to gallery sit.  So today I was at the gallery, hanging out, reading the training manual, learning stuff about how to look after yourself and other people, at least that's the module I worked on today.  I really think that the gallery is a good place.  I have come to find that people who have experienced mental illness have more compassion and understanding than norms.  I dunno, I don't know what else to call people who have no idea what it's like to be crazy.  I also learned how to bend wood, David was giving a workshop on that in the studio area.  That was fun.  I made a hoop and an incense burner.    I'm glad that I've made this goal of becoming a member.  I like that I'm wanting to make art again, wanting to create stuff and try new things.  Learning is a process and I want to keep at it.

      Last night I went to the new DVD rental store in the neighbourhood. I wrecked my account at the other local video rental place by not bringing back a movie.  It's nice to be able to rent from closeby again.  I rented 13 and watched it last night all by myself, Joe went to sleep to tired to watch it with me.  I'd been wanting to see this movie to see how it compared to my own time of teenage rebellion.   I expected 13 to be exploitive, more in the vein of Kids, woo lets look at the girls gone wild and they're only 13!!! but it was better than that.  It reminded me of how vulnerable I was at that age.  I felt sorry for that girl and mad at her and the same for myself at that age.  Adolescense is such a confusing time.  Today I got to see myself in a video promoting the Consumer Initiative Fund.  The meeting discussing the video was kinda boring, I just doodled while adding what comments I thought would make the video stronger.  All in all, I thought Irene did a good job with the video.    I scored 4 rolls of toilet paper from an office building bathroom. Ate lunch at Coast with Marie and Mark - hockey puck burgers for a dollar.  For supper went for free sandwiches then went back to the clinic because my doctor made a mistake with my meds.  I'm always surprised when I realize once again that doctors are not infallible.  Going to the DTES is always good for some free grub though, I got some free orange slices and bread from the Union Gospel Mission near the clinic.   Tomorrow is foodbank day.  That's always exciting; you never know what you're gonna get...   Thirza is over, now I'll kinda watch 13 again with her and Joe.

      So Mean Girls was pretty damn good.  I laughed alot and enjoyed myself.  I resolved never to put that flavour crap on popcorn anymore though, it just makes it taste too damn salty.  Good thing those airmiles coupons come with popcorn and drinks or I'd never buy it at the theatre.  I got extra butter added on so I could cash in the last of the Famous Player coupons my mom gave me for Christmas.  Bought some toilet paper and conditioner with the change on the way home.   Met a guy I used to buy weed from at the bus stop.  We chit chatted about how we both quit smoking weed, and how he doesn't sell it anymore. He's working as a janitor and wants to open his own business.  Everyone has dreams.  I don't really have any, at least my dreams are small.  I just want to get on disability and feel more secure financially.  I have little bitty dreams.  I want to be able to get rid of some of my stuff, to be able to have less and enjoy life more.     urlLink why work?

      Today I made an appointment to see the psychiatrist I saw last year.  I was supposed to start seeing her to get therapy for my sexual abuse history in conjunction with charging my uncle.  I don't want to charge him anymore.  The whole idea of a trial is such an ordeal, I don't feel strong enough to go through it.  I just want to forget him at this point.  I want to see her so I can get on disability II and not feel bad about what he did to me.  I'll see how it goes.  I know that the medication she got me on made a big difference in how I feel.  She's the one who finally figured out that I was bipolar.  I love that I have a label for my craziness.  I'm feeling happier, still very poor and struggling, but I'm not wanting to die all the time and that is such a good thing.  Last night I made my bootleg buspass, now Joe and I can travel together without feeling like it is costing money.  The initial outlay is pricey, $63 plus the 5 to get a good looking colour photo copy, but I think it's worth it for the feeling of freedom having one gives.  I can take transit anywhere now.  I used to get nervous about sky pigs wanting me to take my buspass out of my wallet, but they never take a 2nd glance.  I feel pretty safe using it.  Joe and I are going to go get free sandwiches and then maybe to a movie.  We've got all these airmiles coupons that we've never used because Famous Players movies are so sucky.  The last one we saw was Shrek 2.  Mean Girls is one we talk about going to see but it's not something that has actually inspired us to get out of the apartment and get down to the theatre.  We'll see.

      My name is Stef. I live I breathe.  Right now, I am cold, my fingers feel chilly because my balcony window is open.  My boy cat is snoring, his name is Smudge.  He is so sweet with his little whiffley sounds bubbling out his snout.  I am tired, but I don't want to go to sleep.  I am going to go to bed soon but I thought I would stay up and try this thing out.  I wonder who I will let know about this.  How will I write differently if I let anyone read it knowing who I really am.  My name is STEF.  I've written on diary sites but mostly privately.  I guess the only difference will be in my head, in my inner censor.  The difference will be in what I choose to write about.  Some facts about me.  I am 35  I am biracial, bipolar, and bisexual.  lotsa bi's in me....you don't know the half of it hahahahh...yeah bad pun I know. I live with my boyfriend.  I met him when I was 16.  OMG  I can't believe I've known him for that long!!  I am such an old person now.  yeah, time sure does sneak up on you.  more facts.  I have type II diabetes and an underactive thyroid.  I wear glasses because I'm nearsighted.  I recently quit smoking pot and cigarettes; pot because it wasn't fun anymore and ciggies, well because they're unhealthy and gross.  I have a lot of craziness, like I'm socially inept and anxious around strangers.  Sometimes I freak out about going into situations where I'll have to interact with people.  I tend to avoid socializing altogether.  I'm awkward and goofy.  I like movies.  I like feeling scared.  I like being dominated sexually.  I also like to dominate, but I'm more of a bottom. I'd rather be done - I'm greedy about pleasure. More about my craziness, I also have OCD, I hoard stuff.  I have a hard time throwing things away and I collect things.  I have too many movies and too many clothes, shoes, books, whatever, you name it, I got too much of it...except money...or storage space.  Okay, that's enough self disclosure for today because now I really AM tired...

      Another visit to the shrink and everytime I go the more I think that she's the crazy one.  After this session she's saying to me, you take more Topamax, so you can lose more weight.  This just after Joe had asked me if I'd rather be 10 lbs over weight or under weight.  I said over.  Then I told him I thought I was about the right weight.  I dunno about my shrink man...  She also told me I should move to Israel and live on a Kibbutz, that learning Hebrew wouldn't be hard.  Told me that Joe should have a seder for me so I could see what it's like being Jewish.  I think she wants me to convert and have a baby and add to the State of Israel.   I think she must be a Zionist.  She asked me if I want to have children and I told her that I think about having a baby but I'm afraid that I would be depressed and neglect it.   A baby's not like a cat that you can just leave a bowl of food on the floor, it needs a lot more attention.  Then I told her I was worried about being poor and not being able to provide for a child.  She said a child just wants your time....aha!! back to my original fear.  What about when I'm all wanting to snuff it and the baby is crying?  I just don't want to go there.  That's the reason I HAVEN'T had kids.  I have always gotten depressed - it's a cyclical illness.  I will always get depressed.  It doesn't go away.  Well, it does.  It just comes back eventually though.  Like last night I read this really great book by Lynda Barry  urlLink Cruddy  and it's an awesome and sad story.  I felt so cruddy after reading it though.  I was all thinking of slashing up my wrists and settling into a nice warm bath.  I like that suicide fantasy lately.  but whatever...my point is this crappy brain of mine is always gonna be trying to kill me.  Like whenever I feel bad, right away the first solution I think of is well let's just end it then.  I'm such a drama queen.   blaaaah...sometime this week I should be getting Indian Affairs approval for the antidep Wellbutrin. It has been a long and arduous process for some strange reason.  I asked Thirza how long it took her to get approved....a day.  My shrink is goofy.  She asked me if the form Indian affairs sent her was for me.  I asked her if she had any other patients that were Status Indians. duh.  The shrink is saying it will change my life...  I hope I don't become a moonie or something.

      Things I Did Today.....  Went to the Library...twice, different ones even.&nbsp; I got so many books.&nbsp; I rule with books.&nbsp; I even got cd's.&nbsp; 2 Miles Davis and Ladytron.&nbsp; The Liberry is my boyfriend.Went to the movies, saw ANCHORMAN and snuck into THE BOURNE SUPREMACY.&nbsp; I liked Will Farell's flick better.&nbsp; I say Laughter is better than the eh tension and release you'll feel during&nbsp;that somewhat predictable thriller.&nbsp; The Russian killer was hot though.       In the evening I went with Thirza,&nbsp; Louis and Samonte to the Lantern Festival at Trout Lake.&nbsp; That was a lot of fun.&nbsp; We wandered around looking for a drum group Samonte is&nbsp;thinking of joining, watched them perform then hung out and looked at all the pretty lanterns and people and gabbed and wandered around some more.&nbsp; There was a humungo line at the can so we all went to a convenient dark tree to pee and 2 other desperate people with bulging bladders came hurtling through the murky blackness to pee with us next to the pee tree.&nbsp; It was funny.&nbsp; Louis was all I got to see her milky white ass shining in the moonlight!&nbsp;about&nbsp;the one girlie&nbsp;pee interloper.&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching some fireworks and scarfing down&nbsp;hotdogs we headed back to Louis and Samonte's.&nbsp; Thirza went to her place to get some weed and I went to mine to get a bike to give to Louis.&nbsp; We all live fairly close together.  We watched GHOST DOG.&nbsp; It was okay, it reminded me of when I was really into Japanese culture, when I was reading Hagakare and wanted to be a samarai myself.&nbsp; I remember when I rejected that kind of Honor Glory Soldier fealty brainwash thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was all into Yukio Mishima and then I decided he was a crazy jerk and I wrote a story where the level of hell he dwells in he's continuously shitting on his decapitated head&nbsp;same for him and all the other samarai suicides.&nbsp; It was an anti nationalist story I guess.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some things I admire about Hagakare.&nbsp; I just don't like how it was used to make people into soldiers.   Hmmm....there were a couple few moments when I was wanting to smoke tonight, not just ciggies, pot too.&nbsp; The urge can come back pretty strong sometimes.&nbsp; It's suprising.

      Saw the shrink today.  She asked me if I wanted to start psychotherapy.  duh.  almost got into an arguement.  I said it's a patriarchial world, she said how could she be successful if it was a patriarchal world...whatever lady, you've got some kinda ego if you think your white upper class academic priviledge means feminism has  conquered the inequities between men and women the world over.  I told her I didn't want to discuss feminism.  She said you're a feminist.  I said yeah, I just got my library card back and got a bunch of bell hooks books.  She said I'm a feminist too.  She told me to read Simone de Beauvoir, I said, oh yeah, second wave, I read, Germaine Greer The Female Eunuch .  I didn't want to get into how those feminists left the poor folk in the dust, they got all flustered when it came to race and class.  Anyhow...she talks to me like I'm an idiot sometimes.  She was telling me about residential school abuse.  I told her yeah, my family has a case going against the government and my rapist uncle isn't taking part because he couldn't face my mom.  I kinda feel bad for him because I think he musta been fucked by one of the priests, or another student, but again, whatever, I focus too much on him, forgetting my right to be outraged by my own trauma.  I guess it's easier to speculate about his possible victimization than to feel my pain and anger.  Shrink told me to just leave those feelings in her office anyhow.  Shrink intimated that I might like women, said so you're sexually confused when I told her I liked men AND women.  I told her no I wasn't.  She asked me what it was about women I found attractive.  I told her they were beautiful.  I felt like asking her why she liked men.  She's old and essentialist and probably thinks of bisexuality as some kind of transitional phase disorder on the way to the lesbian disorder that needs to be treated.  I told her I prefer  men, mostly to placate her, but in truth, that's been my choice.  Maybe she'll try and STRAIGHTEN me out.  We'll see.  I had a talk with Marie today about how much Joe has been pissing me off.  Yah know in THE WAR OF THE ROSES where Kathleen Turner says to Michael Douglas, "Sometimes I just feel like smashing your face in"  I've been feeling like that alot lately.  I told her I've been thinking about leaving him.  I love him but he's so fucking clingy.  He loves me more than I love him.  I am the beloved.  He is the lover.  Sometimes I feel like I will drown in his need for me.   There's a missing 5 year old  urlLink girl  in Regina.  I was worried that my bad uncle was the one who snatched her.  Joe and my friend and Shrink all reassured me that she's most likely been stolen by a family member or someone the family knows and not my uncle.  Still, I worry.  I was 5 when he first messed with me.    I'm in the middle of the  urlLink Cremaster Cycle.  Friday I saw 1 and 2, and tonight I watched Cremaster 3..  Tomorrow, I'll see 4 and 5.  I like the cycle, so far I'm alternating between being totally blown away and finding it to be utter tripe, self indulgent artsy fartsy hoohaw.  I lean more towards awesome though.  It's like a very beautiful emptiness.  too long.  takes too long to say not too much at all.  But it looks real good saying it.  ok, that's being too harsh. Barney keeps a scene going on and on and on and on, goes back to it over and over.... belabours a point to death.  again, that's a criticism.  I liked these movies.  They look freaking awesome.  They work like dreams.  but maybe my interpretations are not what Matthew Barney intended at all.  I have to say I was really captivated. I wasn't bored, though, sometimes I'd be like not this again,  I was freaked out alot of the time in 3 and 2, hugging myself...it's only after that you're like fuck, that was too long.  my big criticism, not political, at least, 1 and 2 weren't not that I could see.  I think I'll look for some reviews online, see if I can find someone who can explain Barney's vision to me.

      I saw Spiderman 2 tonight.  I enjoyed it way more than the first one.  Mostly because Alfred Molina as Doc Oc scared the shit outta me.  I was grabbing Joe's hand whenever he had a scene.  Anyone notice how the theme music for the first fusion reactor scene was a ripoff of the Hellraiser theme music?  So yesterday I paid off a humungo fine on my library card.  I got some books on sexual abuse to take home and read some reference material while I was there.  I've decided to proceed with charging my uncle.  I realized that I deserve to have justice.  After reading one of the books I got, urlLink Predators: Pedophiles, Rapists, and Other Sex Offenders: Who They Are, How They Operate, and How We Can Protect Ourselves and Our Children  I also realized that my uncle could still be a predator and I can't hide my head in the sand and forget about any little girls that he could be abusing now.  Even if the cops decide they can't charge him with anything, at least I tried to make the justice system work.

      Today was a good day, though it started off sucky with me being all anxious about seeing my psychiatrist.  I couldn't sleep because I was worried I'd miss my appointment.  I talked to her about how I felt conflicted regarding charging my uncle, that I was mostly doing it to please my mom.  I decided that I'm going to talk to some of my other cousins, see if he messed with them, or could still be raping little kids.  That was the only way I could make my statement last time, thinking he's still doing it and I need to protect other little girls from him.  If I was the only one though, I dunno, I'm not much for revenge.  I feel like I should be more angry, and sometimes I am, but mostly I don't think about him.  Joe thinks I would feel better if I called him or talked to him myself.  We were discussing the whole thing, and I said, what would I say to him?  "Have you raped any little girls lately?  Aren't you going to say you're sorry?"  I know that he has kept me from wanting to have much to do with my relatives.  I'd feel weird whenever his name came up, and I'd think, "Don't they know what he did?  Don't they know I don't want to know anything about him?"  Maybe if I do this I wouldn't feel that way.  I don't think I could ever have any kind of relationship with him even if he did apologize, but maybe the rest of the family would be more respectful of my feelings regarding him.  It would all be out in the open instead of a secret known just by a few.  Maybe I could even forgive him.  It all depends on him, if he acknowledges his wrong or not.  I want to make him face me and apologize for hurting me.  I don't know if he would do that, but I know I'd feel better if he did.  Joe thinks that maybe he would too.  bleagh..enough yucky incest stuff..  Tonight Joe and I went to see an excellent movie - THE CLAY BIRD.  It's set in late 60's Pakistan at the time of Bangla Desh's civil uprising and tells the story of one family's travails in those turbulent times.  Kazi, a doctor and father is a devout Muslim, converting late in life, who sends his son, Anu to be indoctrinated into Islam at a madrasah because he believes the boy is getting corrupted by the Hindus, enjoying their religious festivals and eating their devil's candy.  Ayesha, his wife, who Kazi only ever refers to as "mother of my son", or "mother of my daughter", is trying to be a good Muslim, but she resents the austerity of her husbands faith.  Anu's little sister is too young to understand much about religion, she just knows that Daddy gets pissed off easily and she can't play outside the boundaries of her walled yard.  Anu's uncle, Milon is a secular intellectual, and idealistic activist; much to the disgust of his brother, he marches in support of Bangla Desh's political freedom.   Most of the movie focuses on Anu's experiences, he is the main character.  When he goes to the madrasah, he befriends an ostracized boy named Rokon, and they make each other's lives at the harsh school a little less lonely.  ahh....I'm tired now...  I don't want to wreck the story, but I'll just say that the movie's plot works as an attack on Islamic fundamentalism.  It also has some beautiful music, instructive songs that teach the differences between the Suffi and Shi'ite branches of Islam.  Btw, Pakistan was pretty fucking evil in the whole uprising.  There were almost  urlLink 3 million Hindus killed.

      I've been thinking about my running into the Greek again and in all honesty I have to admit that I'm still attracted to him.  Even though I don't like his personality much, seeing him again and knowing that he still wants to fuck me gives me a frisson of pleasure.  But that's kinda pathetic on my part.  I mean, what the hell!!  It's like I'm being a stupid tease.  I don't want to cheat on Joe...but at the same time I really do.  I want to be a slut.  I think in a past life I must have been a prostitute.    Still, when I think about the fucking around I did,  I feel cheap.  The Greek was the best of the lot and even with him I felt inhibited in a way I don't with Joe.  I can compare my online hooking up to prostitution, the only difference was that I didn't charge money and I expected to be satisfied.  I usually wasn't.  If I was tougher mentally, and more beautiful, I'd be a ho.  I don't have any problems with it morally.  The main problem is that it's a dangerous job; the johns could hurt you.  But mostly I don't think I could do it because of the way I felt after I had sex with the online guys who were selfish and treated me like a ho.  USED.  I don't think getting paid to fuck is worth feeling that way.  Though if you are a pro, I guess you make a mental adjustment, it's not the same as fucking someone you love, it's work.  hmm...sex is a strange thing.  Lately, Joe and I haven't even been fucking.  The last 2 times we fooled around we just kissed and messed around some then I used a vibrator while he finger fucked me and manhandled himself.  I think this penis not entering vagina sex has come about as a result of my fear of getting pregnant, because of my recent close call.  I think I might have had a miscarriage, I dunno though.  I have a strong desire to have a baby when I see children, especially babies, but when Joe gets near me with his cock talking about pumping me full of his joy juice, all I can think of is the mutant kids I've seen at rotten.com.  I take too many meds, one labeled category X!  Not to taken by women planning on becoming pregnant and not to be handled, HANDLED!! by pregnant women.  Now that's a spooky warning.  What the hell kinda baby would those pills make??!!  Anyhow, all I know is  urlLink Peaches  sure does make some damn fine humpety hump sounds to humpety hump to.    check out the diddle my skiddle video, Peaches is funny AND hot in that one.

      Today I got my blood tested to check for my thyroid and diabetes medication levels.  The nurse lady vampire technician whatever you call them, the one what takes the blood from your flesh asked if I came from work.  I lied and said yeah.  I said I worked at Safeway.  I didn't want to tell her that I am living offa the taxes she pays.  I's  ashamed to be a bum and a crazy person.  I try not to be but I still am.    Later  Joe and I were at the neighbourhood mall and I ran into the Greek guy I slept with last year when I was being all slutty and hooking up with guys on the sly.  I don't know why I was friendly towards him but I was.  I guess I just can't help but be civil towards someone who I let into my vagina, even though I never woulda if I hadn't been drunk.  I made some small talk with him but I didn't introduce him to Joe.  That's the second time I met him within that mall, also when I was with Joe.  Both times Joe said he looked at him funny, gave him a "weird look."  I know how he feels, he looks at me weird too, with a questioning, evaluating look.  He still wants to hook up, I said I'd send him an email.  Poor Jean, he felt shitty after.  Later at home, I was asking him about how he was feeling,  and he said he felt like a ghost bonked him on the head at the mall.  OY!  I felt guilty.  I love Joe, but ya know, I still think about that night with the Greek.  It was hot.  He was aggressive and demanding like I like my men to be and made nice sounds, pleasure sounds.  Joe is mostly silent when we're fooling around which bugs me.  Plus there was his big ole cock, bigger than Joe's.   That was nice too.  : P  Thirza came by with her Peaches CDs so I could copy them tonight.  I now have the Teaches of Peaches and Fatherfucker.  Yay for Thirza!!   We started to watch Bubba Hotep but it's kinda silly.  She went home and I haven't finished it yet.  Instead I watched a documentary on how the polio vaccine was grown outta infected monkey kidneys and that's how AIDS was started in Africa.  Stupid scientists are all full of lies watching each others backs trying to cover it all up.  I hate how things work that way.  Actually, one of the grossest things I learned in the documentary, aside from the fact that evil mad scientist Kaprowski was TOLD he had a virus in his vaccine and then chose to ignore the warning from his colleague, took it as a personal attack in the competion to make the vaccine instead, and millions and millions of people have paid the price for his overweening ego, aside from that little fact, today, the polio vaccine is STILL made from ground up monkey parts, even though it could be made from recombinant DNA, because monkey parts are cheaper.   Bleagh.  Profit makes medicine stupid.  If you want to read up on the subject look for the book The River, by Edward Hooper.  or just google it you lazy fatherfucka!!
