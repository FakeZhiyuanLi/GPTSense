The obvious flaw is that emotions are not so easily destroyed, because a word alone does not convey          emotion, it is a whole set of neurological impulses which culiminate in an emotion.           still it is an interesting theory.          &lt;b&gt;Further discussion about words and images&lt;/b&gt;          I have noticed over the years, that words can talk back to you, yes it is true, Take the word laugh, there is something          in the way the letters are arranged that brings to mind a mouth opened wide in laughter, similarly with the word serious,          the letters seem to remind me of a person with a serious face, similarly, the two oo's in gloomy merge with the letter m          to create an atmosphere of gloom. I realised that this observation is not unique, i met at least two people who seem          to feel the same. I have since, realised that this phenomenon is not singular to the english language, at least two other          languages seem to exhibit this. however, scripted languages dont seem to.          I m left wondering, is it the association of emotions with the words that causes this or is there something uncanny......&lt;/font&gt;

            The wizard from hogwarts seems to have ogrewhelmed poor old     Shrek, the fascination for the bespactacled teen which drives     Young fans potty, is in itself rather fascinating. The average local kid     May not know the name of his coloring book, but he knows      Harry Potter and Co for sure.      Though I tend to think of Ms Rowling Potter series as the kids version     Of Tolkein's fantasy world, similarly peopled with dragons, and     Other mythical creatures, as if she were trying to write lOtR     In the guise of Enid blyton. She has rather cleverly interwoven     The school stories of Ms blyton with the ethereal fantastic world     Of middle earth.      Of course credit is due to her since, a lot of others have tried to do a     Similar exercise but have drawn blank.. also because      she made the art of book reading cool again..     The film franchise, spawned by the book, has been rather surreal     So far, described by certain critics as little more than effects amidst     A story.. But this installment of cuaron seems to have captured some     Of the potter magic..albeit a bit dreary atmosphere pervades the screen     And some moments can scare the relatively young audience, however     The slick effects and the magical music score as well as the cast     Of kids who look perfectly natural given that they ve grown to be      Teenagers themselves. Makes it an engaging spectacle.

That have ensured that 3M are known more as a           Maker of paper notes than as a mining company.          Notes that spell disaster          Notes that you cannot do without          Now they have crept into my pc as well, from my table. They sit on my  machine&#8217;s           Desktop, reminding me that I have deadlines enough to die a thousand times ..           Alas those notes ..   of  course those notes..           &nbsp;          &nbsp;          &nbsp;          &nbsp;          &nbsp;          &nbsp;

      Ever notice why anything of grave consequence happens mostly during the night,Nature's fury be it hurricanes, twisters,cyclones,earthquakes,tidal wavesOr accidents- on the road, in the air and on rails. What is it about darkness that Brings about mayhem.The theory about natural causes of disaster is that everything is amplified by a factor of 100 during the night.When a disaster strikes,Such as a flood or an avalanche, the feeling of helplessness is magnified manifold by our inability to see what is happening, so distress increases significantly leading to panic and death. Accidents on road rail and other wise can be explained away on the basis that in the night, the Level of alertness is suspect, and human error often leads to accidents, in addition the fear factor to use a cliched phrase is at its zenith.However nature seems to reserve its best for the night, lightning strikes,hurricane winds and earth quakes are recorded more often between the hours of 9 to 5 in the morning, and traditionally as is called at the witching hourâ€¦.
