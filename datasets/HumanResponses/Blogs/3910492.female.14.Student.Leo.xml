        Life is great. All the time.     Spencer says that. But today, I know&nbsp; that is sooooo true! Not only do 5 guys lyke me, but I get to spend most of the day learning guitar! Jon and Scott can play the guitar! LoL! The 5 guys that lyke me are, my b/f Coy (duh!), Jon, Scott, centure, and Brian. I am not sure if Timothy still lykes me b/c I am really mad at him b/c he asked me some... inappropriate questions. I am going to try to call Coy today, if I can find the cell phone. My mom is at her new job up at the elementary school. She is a special ed. teacher's aide. I don't get why she wants special ed, but that wuz her choice, not mine. Well... I have to go.    TTYL,    XOXOXO,    Luv Ya Bunchez,    Geneva    Coy's Girl    XOXOXO

           I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE MISSION TRIP!!! I am like, sooooooo happy! I just found out that Jon likes me, and a guy that I met, Brian likes me as well!!! I am like, sooooo scared becasue I am going out with Coy, and Jon wants me to break up with him, and I don't want to!!! I like Coy a lot, but I sorta like Jon, but I like Coy SOOOOOOO much better. But I would go out with Jon durring the school year, but not durring summer. School would be fine, but I wouldn't like summer relationships with a guy at my school. I like to have long distance relationships with a guy durring the summer, and durring the school year some times, but the summer relationships don't work so well for me when I am going to the same church and school as the guy... but it is soooooo akward! I sat on the bus with him, next to him all night! And we like, slept next to eachother, and his head was like, an inch from my sholder! I didn't want to wake him up to move it, but it was akward!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sooooooooooooooo confused! I hate mixed feelings! Like, I have mixed feelings about Jon, I mean, I like him, but I have a b/f! If I didn't, then things would change. Well.... I have to go!           XOXOXO           Geneva

       HEY!  I haven't talked to Scott yet today. Liz is in Chicago. Timothy is on the verge of asking me out. Again. I haven't talked to Coy in about 3 weeks. Kalee doesn't know that I have a crush on Scott. Scott nearly asked me out on the phone but I told him that summer relationships suck because I am not allowed to go on dates, but I am allowed to have a boyfriend.  Okay, enough bad news, now the good news!!! I GET TO GO ON A MISSION TRIP TO DENVER!!!!!!!!! I get to go with Brittany, Ryan, Jack, Jon, Felicia, Austin, Jack&amp;Jon's mom, and Brittany's mom!!! We are going to Denver with our youth group and Director, Rick, to help out with the homeless organizations and homeless people! On the last day we get to go white water rafting!!! I am soooo excited! On Friday, Brittany and I are going shopping for snacks and other stuff to bring on the trip! AND! I get to bring a cell phone! My 'rents have never trusted me with a cell phone for more than 4 hours! They are letting me have one for a week!!! I am soooooooooo happy! Well... I have to go! Gonna call Scottie Boy.   XOXOXO,  Geneva

        Okay,      Well, to start off, my computer crashed about 3 weeks ago, so I wasn't able to come and write. Another thing, I am single again. Coy and I broke up because it wasn't working out. In August, Scott asked me out, and we broke up... exactly a week later. (7days) He sees me as his little sister, even though we are only 8months and 3 days apart from eachother... He said that he is not ready for a girlfriend, and promised me that he wouldn't go out with another girl, until he was ready. Well, now he and I aren't talking. He won't talk to me. He won't talk to Liz either. Liz says that when he is ready to talk to her, she will talk to him, but when he is ready to talk to me, I am NOT going to talk to him for a while, just to let him see how it feels. He doesn't get it. I will listen to him, but I won't talk to him unless he mentions Rachel, because she went out of her way to help me... But then there is the issue of all the other guys, I mean, seriously! What if one of them asks me out? What should I say?!? I mean, I can see me going out with Jon, but defenately not Brian, or Centure. I can possibly see me going out with Coy or Scott... again... but I am still thinking about it. This is sooooo complicated! Why do I have to go though this, I mean, I found out that 2 more guys like me! There is Robert, a nineth grader... and he has an outline of a 6-pack-abs! Then there is a guy who sat next to me in Science, Zak. He and I aren't going to be in the same science anymore because I am getting my schedule changed, but that is besides the point! Well, I have to go, my bother is calling me to finish dinner!          XOXOXO     Luv Ya Bunchez,     Geneva     XOXOXO
