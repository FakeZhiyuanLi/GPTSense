      I'm walking my dogs like I do every night. I always walk them around the neighborhood and then up to the middle school. I take them out on the track so they can run around in a fenced area and I don't have to worry about them. Well, usually there is no one out there. There aren't any lights and the only way you can see is because of the light of the moon (how romantic).   I'm minding my own business not thinking about anything in particular, when out of nowhere I hear, "hey man, how about some privacy!" What? Of course this freaked me out. What I didn't realize was that my new place for walking the dogs turns out to be the high school make out spot. Some poor kid is trying to make some moves on a 14 year old and I'm humming some tune just walking along not paying any attention. Well, then the dogs want to know whats going on so they run over and start licking and jumping on these kids. Terrible. I ruined the kid's play.   So I took off with the dogs and never looked back. If you're out there kid, sorry, and better luck next time.

      i've always thought it was ridiculous to wear a headset while talking on a cell phone. headsets are for guys with hair plugs and drive a benz. well, i tried a headset today, and i was wrong. talking on a cell has never been easier. i now look like one of those people that seems to be talking and laughing to themselves while searching for a box of cereal at the grocery store.

      Uh huh, I've logged about 100 hours over the past 10 days training myself to become Norton Antivirus. I am now able to spot any virus anywhere at anytime. My computer is clean like a freshly windexed window.   KB has a shower this weekend. Should be fun. SD and SB in about two weeks.   Right before that -- Simon and Garfunkel. Can't wait.

      Yes, I wear a wedding ring. No, I am not married. Here's the deal. A lot of women feel that they are always being hit on by any guy who talks to them. I don't blame women for this, because most of the time it's true. So, I decided to start wearing a wedding to take away all of the awkwardness that goes on when you talk with a stranger.   It works. But, it works in a way that I didn't think it would. It works in a way that makes guys a lot more laid back around you. Women are more laid back as well because you're all of a sudden seen as someone that's NOT talking to them just to get them to go out with you. Basically, they know what they are seeing is what they are getting. Who needs to impress anyone if you're married? So, that works. Back to the deal with the dealing with guys. I forgot how competitive guys are with other guys, especially when other girls are around. When you're seen as being married, they know they don't have to worry about competing with you. It's great.   Don't you think it's strange? Aren't you lying to people? What if someone really likes you and wants to go out, but they think you're married? What's wrong with you? Ahh the many questions.  Here are the answers:  1.Strange=Yes. I've heard of non-married men wearing wedding rings before, but because they wanted to be hit on. That doesn't make sense. I wouldn't want to date someone that hits on me because they think I'm married. 2. I don't think I'm lying to anyone. If someone asks, and I feel like telling them, I'll tell them I'm not married. I've been asked, and for the most part I tell them that I'm not. Then of course I get the usual questions. Either way, it's a great conversation piece.  3. If someone really likes me and wants to go out, they will ask if I'm married. If I'm interested I'll tell them I'm not married and we can go out.  4. Nothing  So when am I going to take it off? At the end of the summer I'm moving. The ring will come off then. In the meantime I've decided that I'm going to write a short article about how I've been treated while wearing a wedding ring for the past 6 months. I've had some interesting conversations with both men and women.   There is one problem. Sometimes you don't get to explain the "why" part of wearing a wedding ring. And, people tend to get the wrong impression. I don't blame them. I probably would too.   ***Note for guys***There is one thing that is for sure about wearing the ring. Old married women will love to talk with you. And those stories seem to be the best so far. I had a great one with the old lady from Zales' where I bought mine.

      So, I went to see The Village tonight. One of the many things I had to get used to while living in Austin was going and doing things by myself. With an occasional exception, I usually go to movies, restaurants, and whatever shopping I do, by myself. This doesn't bother me, and living here for almost a year now, I'm used to it. What's great about it is that I get to pay attention to what strangers are saying and doing around me. People are strange. The couple sitting next to me tonight discussed what they believed would be "the ultimate dance club." See-thru walls into the bathrooms, headphones for everyone so an individual could control how loud they wanted the music,  and mp3 players so each individual could listen to what they wanted while dancing with other people listening to what they wanted. And the entire club was shag carpeting with no shoes allowed.  The Village was, well, pretty good. The problem is that with his movies you are always looking and trying to figure out the twist because you know it's coming. If you figure it out early, the movie isn't completely done...you can sit there and try to appreciate what he's doing to get to where he wants to go. The idea is there, it's done pretty well, the acting is so-so, and that's about it. Go see it. And take someone with you if it's a Saturday night. People think you're weird when the seat next to you is empty and it's one of the only seats left in a sold out theatre.

      Today I was at Bed Bath and Beyond. I, for the first time, am taking measures to ensure a great night's sleep. My bed has always been fairly comfortable, but I've never put any time into making it&nbsp;extremely comfortable. So, I'm checking out all of the stuff at BB&B and it's pouring outside. I've already been in there for quite a while because I had&nbsp;no idea what I wanted and it took a while for me to make some decisions. Well, I still hadn't decided what I wanted and I had been asked if I needed help several times from many different employees. Then the power got cut. And, I guess they had been worried that I was a shoplifter because I had been in there for so long and hadn't bought anything, because when the lights went out, I found myself surrounded by employees. It was weird. I was in the middle of opening a package containing a down comforter when the lights went out, and I guess they thought I was putting stuff in the package. They all asked in a very cult-like fashion if I needed any help again, so I asked if the security cameras still worked while the power was out. They didn't think it was funny. It seems to be that way with my sense of humor. For example, after BB&amp;B I headed to Fuddrucker's and in the middle of ordering my food my voice cracked. So I said in a crackling voice, "being a teenagers cool." Stewart (the guy working there) thought I was ridiculous and of course I found it amusing.

      I just got back from Keith and Judy's wedding in Dallas. It was very nice wedding. John David lost his tuxedo jacket and the next morning was looking all over for it. About that time Flint called me and asked if I had an extra tuxedo vest because he lost his. He said he asked the front desk at the hotel if they had it, and they handed him a tuxedo jacket with John David's cell phone in it. I think they had been drinking a little bit. It was great to see everyone one last time before I move. I'm going to miss my friends.

      All right Erica. Here's your answer to Spiderman 2. Check out the movie Leo. Best I have seen in quite a while. It has Elisabeth Shue in it. She had a chance to really be good in this one. She blew it.

      I'm in San Diego. I was here for last weekend and then I went to SB for the week. I think I found a place for Katherine and I to move into. It should all work out from here. It's nice. I heading back to Austin on Monday and then to Dallas on Thursday for Keith's wedding. I should have been posting during this whole trip because there have been some interesting moments. One that comes to mind is Flint sleeping under the desk in the hotel room for three nights because he said he was scared of sleeping in the same room with Brad and John David.  &nbsp; Thanks for the comments Erica....you're number 1.

      I just got back from Simon and Garfunkel. It was fun. Garfunkel has big hair. Ryan and I had a good time. We met up with my sister and her friends after the show. They enjoyed it. I'd like to do it again, but that probably isn't ever going to happen. Once in a lifetime deal. I recommend it.

      I'm not a big fan of these types of movies. But, I'm growing to like them more and more. This one was entertaining. I liked it better than the first. I enjoyed the way the movie makes fun of comic books. There were a few little symbolic things that I like to look out for. For example, notice at the end of the movie when Peter's buddy throws the knife through the mirror. Then notice as he's making his way back to the secret room he has to swipe away a spider's web. Hmmmmm. Anyway, I liked it. Ryan and I had a good time. She and I will have even a better time at Simon and Garfunkel tomorrow night.

      My dog Dwight, scared of all of the fireworks, ate through the fence and both dogs escaped last night. Ridiculous. He got scared and took off. I felt sorry for him. He looked scared. The neighborhood kids tracked them down. So, Dwight, Zeke, and I all sat in the backyard and watched the fireworks show while everyone hung out in the front yard. It was fun.  Simon and Garfunkel tomorrow night. USA v. Russia in volleyball tonight.   Found a place to live in SB: http://www.jlrentals.com/pages/2/index.htm

      For those of you that don't know my family, the 4th of July is bigger than Christmas around here. Every year the family is in a great mood, we all get together for a big cookout, and watch the fireworks from the panoramic view in my parent's backyard. It's great. This year I get to really enjoy it. Usually I'm packing up the car and having to drive a long way to get to my parent's house. Not that I ever minded doing this, and most of the time I enjoyed it, but this year it's nice to not have to worry about loading dogs, locking up cats, and driving 7 hours with someone that didn't want to be with you in the first place. I get to sit back and just enjoy hanging with the family.   Last night I took the dogs out for a jog around Town Lake. I went out around 9:30. I think that may be a bit too late for a jog through those trails. I didn't bring a flashlight, and although I can see well at night and it was a full moon, there were several spots where I had no idea where I was going. I was the only car in the parking lot and I only passed one other jogger during the hour and a half long jog. I did, however, pass over the Lamar walker's bridge and found myself in the middle of a big hippy musical festival. It was great. I had heard this banging drum and some yells for quite a while, but I had no idea what was going on. In the middle of the bridge there was a group of about 200 people just having a great time playing some music and dancing. That's Austin for you.   Anyway, halfway through the jog I found a place that juts out over the lake with a bench. You look right over Town Lake at the downtown skyline. On a clear night, with a full moon, and downtown lit up, it looked great.   Austin is such a great place. I will most likely never live in Dallas again. And, if I live in Texas again after California, I hope it's in Austin. The people are so laid back here and there is a ton of fun things to do. It's amazing how much influence the place you live in has on your attitude. I never realized how much of a bad mood I was in while living in Dallas and Lubbock. Dallas has so many people into nothing but money, and Lubbock is pretty conservative and judgmental. If you're not careful, like I was, you can fall into that same attitude. Not me again. Relaxed is the way to go.   I didn't really want to get into this in this post, but why not. Dallas had this effect on me where I felt compelled to keep up with and try and be better than everyone else. I think it's a common attitude there. In Lubbock, I was extremely judgemental and high strung. There were a lot of factors involved with that, but I know a lot of people in Lubbock that were that way as well. People are wound a little too tight in Lubbock. At least I was when I was there. Almost right after moving to Austin I felt myself start to relax. My whole attitude changed. It wasn't immediate. It was slow, but it happened. I am the same person I've always been in that I'm easy to talk with and comfortable around most people. But now, I don't stress anymore. I don't get worked up about anything. I don't snap at people. I'm not grouchy. I have fun. I keep a lot of things to myself now and that's something I used to never do. I deal with the issues I have to deal with and get on with it. I don't dwell or feel like everything is a life or death decision. I learned how to deal with and treat everyone that I have a relationship with in my life (the right way). I learned how to let go of things that are not good for you in your life, and treat the things that are good to you right. Basically it's this: I toughened up and grew up (thank goodness).   I don't know why I went off on that. I think it's almost the same post I made back in January in the old blog. I guess it started with the Dallas, Lubbock, Austin comparison. Either way, I like Austin and I wouldn't mind living in Dallas or Lubbock now, but being away for a while has been nice.

      So, I'm walking my dogs just as I usually do every night (again). We're walking along our same path that we always take and I hear someone talking and see a flashlight. Then I see the dog. Some mutt with long legs and one big ear. He comes flying out of the bushes and attacks one of my dogs. For those of you that don't know, I have one dog that won't back away and another that will hide at all costs. So, one dog jumps behind me and the other one latches onto the other dog's nose. I don't blame him though. The mutt came out of nowhere and starting growling and snipping at my dog.  So now I'm playing doggy bouncer trying to break up this fight. The fat old guy that owns the mutt comes huffing and puffing down the trail yelling at his dog "Ted." Who names their dog Ted? Seriously. TED.   I pull my dog away and yell at the other dog and the fat guy. He doesn't say a word, doesn't apologize, he just puts the leash on TED and grunts away. You know that sound that fat people who are putting out some sort of effort make? Yeah, that sound. I told him sorry and good night.  It looks like walking the dogs is turning into a highly eventful nightly event for me.  Album of the week: Nick Drake's "Five Leaves Left"  Take care.

      This was a tiring weekend. On Thursday night I met up with John David, Suzanna, and Jenny at Lucky Lounge. But before they showed up I met up with Ryan and Krysten. I also ran into Carlos and Kim. So we all hung out and ended up at Kirby Lane where an 18 year old was staring me down for some reason. The whole night was fun.  Friday was fairly boring. Saturday we floated the river with about 25 other people and ate at the Gristmill. I sat at a table with people I didn't really know but no problems. On Sunday I went swimming at Barton Springs with JD, Suzanna, Jenny and Sam. We then ate at Shady Grove and played pool at The Ritz. I'm exhausted with nothing funny to tell although there were funny things that happened. This was a very fun weekend.
