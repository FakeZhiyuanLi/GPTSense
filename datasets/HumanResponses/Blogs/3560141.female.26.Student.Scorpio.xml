      It's amazing how the mind can play tricks on you, and even stranger that because of medical school, I can probably deduce that these mood swings are all a product of some tiny neurotransmitter, some tiny hormone that binds to some receptor causing all this havoc in my head...  I'm in some sort of weird mood, where I even got defensive at the beauty salon...the manicurist said, so...besides your eyebrows, do you think you might want to get your nails done...I snapped in my own stupid way, by curtly saying I like them this way, short, and with dirt under them....  Can it be possible to feel much more inclined to see yourself as retarded (no offense) more so than you did as a teenager?  Someone said to me yesterday something which she may have meant as a quippy remark, but it seemed to hit it on the head...as a teenager we think, "we know everything.." in our mid 20's we realize we know nothing about life, politics, IRA's, or our futures, and in our thirties is when it all comes together...in equal and fine balance...  I am too consumed with establishing myself now, to notice world issues, or even plain and common everyday entertainment news, or even be concerned with our own good green earth...when I was given the opportunity to hear it all beforehand from my parents in my teens my ears held up picket signs in silent rebellion, I am hoping my thirties brings complexities which I feel are manageable, and are worth asking my parent's advice on with all the rioting in my ears being over and all....  I'm just uneasy about something, and I don't know what it is???  I wish I could fall asleep really early today, and just wake up happier...

      I went to baggage claim and retrieved my checked in luggage, not before some old lady had already began unzipping it to make sure it was hers...why did she have to open the one compartment with all my undies in it...I mean the embarrassment was just...well expected because what else would happen to someone like me???  I started to say, the luggage it was lighter I left something big in Miami...huge in fact.. I landed and the humidity in Miami just clung to my thighs as if to say welcome home...He pulled up and ofcourse had a mild confrontation with some pedestrian traffic controller on a head trip..confrontation settled with some fancy manual transmission maneuvering...which trunk would I go to I thought.  How could that be the first thought I have..I thought...I was thinking too much, much the way a puppy gets when you show it a chew toy and a treat...simultaneously...  Oh my god to have his touch meshed with his words after soo long...all my anxiety melted into his maroone leather seats, either that or the humidity sticking to my thighs just condensed...either that or now I was thinking about all the meshing that would end up happening...hahaa  We spoke so openly, maybe influenced by alcohol, maybe I'm just letting go of these barriers to getting hurt I don't know, but I wanted him to know that our distance may be good for us now, that every hurdle he or I ever placed along the track to where we are RIGHT NOW...was worth it...that even if this is where it plateaus...I could never ask for anything sweeter.  We laughed, laughed so hard he almost left with a concussion after knocking his head into the bannister behind our table so many times, we ate and drank at these beautiful places but it was his skin and his lips that tasted like perfection..So many close encounters with the threat of being arrested for lude and the other "l" word acts in public, a lot of meshing, exciting, tantalizing, sensual meshing...  I saw my babies too, the whole clan..it was amazing...those women I have as friends they had me rolling on the floor, and I know that no matter where time or planes may take us all away to, I will always see their warmth, they looked at me differently you know like with a lot of respect and maybe even pride...It also felt really army like because well, we all had on creme pants and pastel tops for Divvy's bridal shower, we were on a mission for pure fun and quality time, Mission accomplished...on to the wedding...I hugged her with all my strength, I told her in a card ofcourse, because sentiment rolls off my tongue with an anchor attached to it...straight to the floor, my belly says this is a good thing...that feeling we all get when a family member or family like friend meets someone new...you get this peaceful or disturbing rumbling in the tummy, like is he going to hurt her, is he going to respect her...my belly had the fizzes, alka-seltzer style, very relieving the moment Mr. Jefferson looked at Divvy, he was enamoured lost in her, I loved it, I felt she was safe, I didnt have to worry, it's not like my worrying would protect her like a bubble, but it's selfish I could close my eyes and know she's going to be ok forever...and ofcourse I had to include the staple side of sarcasm by saying it could've been the fact that I had diarrhea...but otherwise it's all systems go....she laughed her contagious giggle and I remembered that she knows how much I care..  We read the paper together, that was amazing, I'm the biggest weirdo...these god forsaken old couple things are appealing to me...I like fighting over sections of the newspaper, having him look at me quite perplexed as to why with all my might I could swing and completely miss the golf ball...Brunch was dreamy...he perfectly combined food and flattery...he knows too much, including my ninja status...The proudest moment for me was when he swept everyone off their feet including some potentially fake British guy with his amazing wit and charm...I got annoyed at one point, because I wanted it all for myself...I need to take a stab at sharing...One of the partakers in the being swept off of their feet activity, squeezed my hand and said he is so amazing, look at how happy you are, you guys are beautiful together, a comment which we heard in NY, and also from the Brit...I always let these comments roll off my shoulder (on the outside) right into my heart...I just reached around him and squeezed him like an empire waisted cloak...We discussed in crude terms my needing to take a stab at sharing, and letting go of insecurities...How can he be younger, the farthest from thinking like we're in a pseudo relationship, yet he is the one who makes all the sense..who says things that really just make sense???  He has brought something out of me that hasn't surfaced since a wild autumn night in 1997...I wanted to share everything with him, wanted to take care of him, not just party my ass off, but make sure he eats well...See, I'm a natural babier or motherer whichever makes more sense, it's a little bit of the humanitarian in me but also a lot of the narcissist...like "I know what's best for you.., don't worry I'll do it..", these last few years I have been self indulgent, like fulfilling my every whim for selfish reasons, but for all the jokes I make about him being a full grown baby who doesn't have salt in the house :), damnit I almost bought salt at the grocery store...Even if this ends up being the demise of our whimsical friendship/love affair, I am so happy to see that side of me reemerge, because I was banking on being the really cool aunt for my brother's kids who orders take out, travels non stop, and drinks martinis after a hard day, maybe now I see I have room in my heart for other people...  Enough..I'm made myself gag now...

      Days away from going home...where by the way, I nor my family owns a home....that's the only definition I have for a place like Miami, where I spent at least 5/13 of my life...I'm nervous.  I'm going to see him, my friends, one of which is scheduled to take the big plunge on the 31st of July, so a bachelorette-ing we will go.  Speaking of which all this talk of weddings (the Armenian is headed for the altar in September, another wedding to go to) has got me in a weird mood.  I'm starting to look at babies and couples and all the "Family Circle" like cover pictures that pop up everywhere.  I am fighting that biological clock with a wrench, I mean I'm in no position mentally, emotionally or geographically to say I'm ready to settle down.  I barely know where I will be in one year much less a lifetime, that's the catch to this "last resort" med school option I've chosen.  My residency could have me in the Tristate area, to S. Florida to Hawaii, if it were all up to me.  But those cheeks and little hands, and the young power couples with the little teacup dogs, pale green walls, wood floors and dark wood and steel furniture, god, this is really starting to appeal to me.  It's not a little but a lot weird, because of me because within the last few years I've changed so much.  The Armenian and I were smoking cigs (a true sign that I may not yet be wifey-ready)and he told me that he used to fight this one demonic image that kept popping into his head....waking up grabbing a half put out cig, and a bottle of black label and that's how he would commensurate his day, how now, that demon has left his being...Well...my eyebrows raised, I looked at my toes, looked into the house where a pile of papers and books crowded the coffee table and thought....   As recently as 2001, I was struggling with the demon in actuality, how lost I was...I can't imagine the same disregard for my future, the same blur of hangovers and strobe lights, overdue bills, just lost...  I want a test run with a baby puppy, I want to see if I demonstrate enough patience, the love portion, let's just say I've been waiting a lifetime to give it all away...Anyone who knows me a little too well, would probably laugh at the thought of me driving a van with little kids screaming, actually they probably could picture me driving a bus with little kids screaming, but point being...I get befuddled (new favorite word) because I want to sit on the floor and play with tinkertoys, not by myself with a little kiddie, oh my god my kids are going to have to be raised in a very old school house because technology surpasses my grasps, hopefully their father will know a thing or two about X-cube or game box or whatever....  Oh...the father, well...it would be dreamy...safe would be the word...I don't know but I wish I had more than a wrench to stop the seconds from ticking away...

      I guess I didn't write about this earlier because I needed to process yesterday.  My father drank two beers at Sushi Samba, Asahi's mmmmm....22oz. I guess you could say he took down a forty, my old drink of choice a very looooonnnngg time ago, I'm not embarrassed it's the meager beginnings of the alcoholic I strive to be these days..by the way, I'm so old, I can't even drink a glass of white wine, without feeling the "buzzes"...  Wow, I even write the way I talk when I get nervous about something, first base, second base, hockey, boxing, polo and then back to home plate...I felt really sorry for him, my father, really really sad, I was so befuddled by these feelings that I chain smoked this morning without pacing, no hesitation...didn't help.  In his semi-drunken stuper filled lunch conversation and stroll through the park, my poor father spilled his ego onto the table and then onto the green lawns and then onto me....what I mean is at first I tuned him out, because he started out quite normally as he usually does, my speech went like this, I told these jokes, these people were impressed...but then he said it the sentence that ripped me from the porno channel running in my head (i know...I'm looking into using the CAGE questions to assess my level of addiction)....He says, "I'm nothing D, I don't have anything, I make nothing for the amount of work I do, I am a nobody, I will never be in my lifetime what I have always dreamed of becoming...this is what I wish for you."  I didn't know people like my father had an insecure cell in their bodies, and if they did they would somehow have it transplanted...is what I thought...I processed this sentence over and over, clicking away at any and everything even when my internal memory was full I just kept clicking..indicating my internal memory was overloaded.  He proceeded to say how he has to project this image, sometimes it consumes him, he isn't white, he's relatively new to the lucrative private practice business..he is within the company of men who own ten clinics worth over 5 million each, don't get me wrong D, he says, I make a lot more than the average person, but I will never be worth several million dollars.."...my father has been eaten alive by the green headed monster who is insatiable...I hope it spits him out alive and whole...  Several million Dollars...oh my god...these are the likes of men who own homes that face this park, that span the city block we just travelled through...I just wanted my father to own a Rolex, drive a really nice car, wear really nice shoes, have money and power that would allow him to take a break finally, not retire, he would collapse from boredome..a home with jasmine bushes, coconut trees, and horses everywhere - you see his is still the proud Indian villager who wants his village to have proper health care schools and basic sanitation - near the ocean, with huge glass windows, I wanted him to be with my Mom, and bring her, her most sought after material wish, him...I wanted him to open a small production studio, where he could make the Indian cartoons he has dreamed about in his head since telling me stories before I slept back in 1989...I just wanted him to work hard enough to be happy...see I know my father better than i let on...I try to create this distance, this war because I am so scared I will become eaten too, if this monster has the taste for the same kindred blood....  He wants to build a dock where I can launch his ship of a thousand dreams, he sees the creative fire in me, the love of nature, the humanitarian, the thirst for the finer things, although I would never buy a purple pin strip suit - our tastes for finer things is where we split paths - He thinks I can be what he never could...doesn't sound extraordinary..most parents do....but it's the fact that he feels so defeated despite his worth as a father, husband, doctor, and human being.  He feels he can't ever stop, because he still falls short, never the holder of more than the "image", what he wants is to be holding the camera, creating the image...I just feel really sad, that I haven't taken more time out to pat him on the back, to tell him that he doesn't need anymore, and that I will make a majority of his dreams come true and I will take care of him, and that he is a great father....

      As one can see...I bought a new camera, a new really old looking camera, because I was sick and tired of being outbid in the last ten seconds of every e-bay auction.  It started with the Olympus mega outdoor camera with waterproofing and perks galore, well, now I have this Kodak brand camera with barely a megapixel and it holds like ten pics on internal memory, so my adventures through Central Park yesterday would only be captured for the first two hours, because by then the battery died and my camera had stored its last pic...Father's Day went well...odds in my favor...

      So...tomorrow's D-day, Daddy's Day and to some doom's day too...well, I'm 50:50 with this one, tomorrow could potentially go really well, or I could end up coming home with that look, and head straight for the Marlboro pot the Armenian and I have created...that look of why me, why didn't I go with him to get Indian food at the temple (his absolute favorite is South Indian food) instead of going to get sushi (his second favorite food), now he thinks I have absolutely no organizational skills and have no family values because I didn't cater to his FAVorite instead of his second favorite...  I wonder where my neurotic - isms come from?  but how amusing that I know this is what I could be subjected to and this is what I could end up feeling, and that it should be temporary now that "I know better", but it's still my pops, his approval matters so much...  You know I can't be around too much perfection because of this guy.  The more decrepid, confusing, unorganized, or desheveled something is, the more solace I find in it.  I want to see people's faults and love them for it, but who can love faults right...swindled again..I still end up being the complainer of all that is not what I expect, meaning I let people be themselves, one of the least judgemental people around but then when they fall short of some weird overachiever psychic expectation, I act like I didn't know getting tied to the traintracks might end up getting you run over, so really it's a big trick, as a wise he always says...  And..to top it all off, I'm the biggest hater of flawless game ever...like the Indian girl who is smart, Spiritual AND RELIGIOUS, perfectly blended with Eastern and Western values like an Ohm printed on a Billabong shirt, who doesn't drink or smoke, who is athletic, socially apt, and in medical school, well...i wish she would combust too (see previous entry)..because damnit, I have worked too long and hard at not being any of these things, suffered hard stares from many an Indian socialite and spent way too much time in school to make myself infamous to have it all washed away like a sand castle at high tide...I am always trying to make the simple point that "outside the box" is way cooler than inside the square..

      No different than any other day...except it feels longer  This guy who rotates with me told me this story today...He knows a guy in Chinatown who'll make him an Omega watch for twenty dollars.  He told me how he spent the more amusing portion of his day convincing a set of residents that it truly was a fake, that the craftsmenship was of superb quality, but it was definitely a fake.  He knows because he was accosted his second day in NYC by three young men and the only thing they took when mugging him was his fake Omega watch.  They punched him in the eye, but took a twenty dollar watch.  My partner relived her experience in Dominica, the ease of a Caribbean breeze, the solitary street light that shone above their apartment complex, and a truck load of locals with machetes who appeared as if they were pirates.  She moved three weeks later, but her other two complex resident buddies remained on their patios always armed with machetes with longer blades and a single door to an apartment with a phone always propped open, set up specifically for the getaway.  I have gotten items of value stolen from me, but I've never been shaken to the core before.  That core, the place that houses respect and hope in fellow man.  If I ever came face to face with an addict who had transcended every ounce of civilized living just to get another fix, or a hungry person who would eat my core alive in order to survive I believe I would curl into a ball and surrender to the idea of faithlessness....Just a thought that invoked serious fear and gratitude

      It's weird how two people can have so much admiration for the other sitting in the lap of...  He says you live a life with qualities that I wish for, I close my eyes when he tells stories so I can drift away from mine...His lifestyle chimes with rockstar - dome, the likes of which he will never admit to.  He lives in a dreamy apartment in the sky and valet's his European sports car every evening after a long tortuous day of computer based work, meetings to discuss business ventures, projects with roots in many forests...His hippocampus works on overtime packing new amazing ideas into short therm memory that day by day grow into tangible be it or be it not gambles, he delegates his responsibilities only willing to subject others to work he would otherwise find himself overwhelmed with...he has gadgets like ipods, flat screens, watches that are worth more than my rent, credit card thin cameras...He has his eyes and his savings set on property he wants to buy, like instead of an apratment in the sky a condo in the clouds, he watches the market and knows the lingo, He buys a paper everyday, but he has the Sports Section memorized, he knows the words to every song ever, quotes great authors from the library of books he has read, can actually differentiate between a good and a bad movie these days, has been on stage with lines and everything, knows porn stars personally, takes golf lessons, did I mention he's younger than me... and he parties beyond what the average person would call a party (try impressing him) in deserts, on beaches, on boats, in a metropolis or in the Keys, in style with plush couches and bottle holders with ample mixers at his disposal... I can only assume as my life's shadow has fallen quite short in recent times....I listened today as he spoke of a project, one that would carry itself into stability, this project which could now possibly carry him to the verge of a bigger gamble, but a gamble with a wager closer to his heart...He could tap that well, full of creativity, spontaneity, full of those one line texts he so quickly sends telling me of new ideas I should write on, use all of that power (I sound dianetics - ish)to make a name for himself...He is never afraid of ideas....  Ok these are the tangible things I admire, what about the brain behind the He...He thinks for himself, not for others to notice, others notice because I pour the spotlight on his achievements at least within my circle...He is unrelenting when his brain is STILL in the mood, no idea is left unturned....He speaks with confidence, with utter confidence...He works the atmosphere, the person doesn't even know they're being charmed...His assertiveness never oversteps its bounds into cockyland...He will go up to two gay men in a city that is not his and ask for input on an idea he has for a gay friendly gym, utter confidence...He is never afraid of ideas...He will buy a crippled, lonely old man with one ticket to a movie, a soda and a popcorn...a heart with real empathy under the poker exterior...  He says respect amongst my peers, a worthy profession, a so-called talent for writing (I think it's like my pouring spotlight thing) or a creative soul, a high intellect, a certain likeable character (it's the people pleaser in me), stability...this is what he sees me as sitting in the lap of...it's funny how we cloud ourselves with pessimism.....

      "Says he wants you, Says he needs you, if he wants you, why not let him wait for you..."  I'm not sure how this works, this could be good karma for some drama that recently occurred at school, or this could be bad karma for wishing for too many things to change, disguised as good karma...either way here goes the story..  The Armenian pops his head in the door and says, "...hey I gotta message from Hat (that's what we'll call him), he says that you are lookin' fine and that song dip it low...well, it reminds him of you...", What??  Great, I think...I don't even know what song that is, probably some garbage about booty shaking and dirty dirty sex....but I am, however compelled to find out what is this song...and how does it remind him of me..?  An array of Kazaa searches later, in between all the new pop-ups I now have to close since installing the newer version despite being warned by a wise roommate that warned me, there it was "Dip it Low" Christina Milian, downloading in progress..  "Take your time..feel him out..when he's a good boy, a really really good boy, why not let him lay with you, that's when you give it to him good..."  Ok, for those who haven't seen this video...SHE IS SMOKIN', Definitely the next Beyonce or even better...very seductive, very mysterious, totally in control, with some very wicked dance moves.  Since the reference to Beyonce, I was unable to see the literal connection between her, the song and me, but I remember the incident that fueled Hat's interest...It was mysterious, seductive, and filled with some pretty cool dance moves...(i.e. a drunken night's make out session with plenty of dancing involved, this is where all my trouble starts under those strobe lights)...maybe this was it..  "...Dip it low, pick it up slow, roll it all around and make your back go..Pop.."  It's not so much that I want him or want anything more from that night, but it's more like there's this confident, sexy man who knew me as a little goof, but now sees me as this "sexy little minx.."  It's the fact that HE wants me that makes me hot..God that's sick right, I think he's sexy too, but noone I would sleep with or date, more like a good friend to have. He's intensely strong and un-rattleable, this is too intimidating for someone like me.  If you're too smooth, that means eventually I'm going to get duped, and if there is always an answer I'm going to run out of questions.  Maybe he would never understand the fact that sometimes these sweaty palms of mine need holding before entering a big building with many, many socialites...I already have this amazing presence in my life who sees everything and brings me this wholesome happiness...he's the man I dream about "dipping it low on.." (see previous entry)..hat seems to be drawn to "Drunk D", my alter ego, confident, sexy, hilarious, never at a loss for words and a huge flirt....I   "Late at night, he's comin' home..meet him at the door with nothin' on...."  You see, I've never really been objectified, so that's probably why this feels so invigorating, after I reread this I'm probably going to confuse myself as to whether I want to be appreciated as an intellect or a "sexy little minx", who knows, I know it's going to be short lived this novelty of feeling kinda sexy, but I guess one might see me with a little extra strut in my loafers, button down shirt and white coat today...

      It's going to sound weird...why do I always start these things off this way, like noone else thinks this way...if i see this happen one more time I swear I'm going to get into plastic surgery for all the wrong reasons, not reconstruction, not enhancement I'm just going to build a nation of taut faced, plump lipped, 26" waisted, non-saddle bag having, bootylicious, lipo - ed, botox - ed, mountainous boobed having monsters...before I actually get offers for private loans to help me through the rest of school, the reason I feel this way, is because I am not one of these people who is naturally or surgically built this way for one, so if this seems like one big complaint...good at least it's honest...and two by default, I automatically get the raw end by being one of the average if not below average people who are being compared to these buxom beauties...  My mother once offered me the chance to get a boob job to enhance my self confidence, but I refused because I work really hard to maintain a natural athletic/actually big boned appearance...Really, I think I refused because from the waist up, I consider myself pretty petite but if I tried to make myself more top heavy (which I have tried with toilet paper and small pillows...damn those drunken girlie sleepovers), I look absolutely mammoth, so I refused...1/2 a chance is better than none...  ok, 1/2 a chance at what one might wonder beyond the world of porn (no knocks against porn, I support this quite avidly, see previous entry)...the world is sold immediately by a beautiful face with a beautiful body...obvious observation, nothing mind blowing here...but what about on the professional circuit...and even more obviously when trying to shape yourself as a person...I mean you just don't have to be an overachiever when most things are just handed to you...you just don't have to be witty or charming, nor do you have to have the right bag or blouse...If you looked like this you could be picking a wedgie dressed in Hanes and cue ball pajama pants and well...tadaaa you have porn...or better yet, a great job, friendly people all around you, and you would never have to lift anything over five pounds..(oh dont worry biceps can be implanted...)  I have had to overcome this serious demerit I was handed for shoving while I was waiting in the registration line for a kick ass exterior in the Great Beyond, so I worked it the best way I knew how, I developed a smart mouth instead of "jolie" lips, a mind filled with useless tidbits about every subject in the book to "connect", instead of GGG Cups...Well ladies and gentlemen...for no freaking good reason except to be considered the girl with the great personality...  We all know the grass is greener, and right now I don't want to hear about these women who are saying, "I just wish they would take me seriously..", or how about the great personality chicks who go for the implants...and don't look mammoth...doubly don't care...cuz they're doubly blessed, and well those who are built this way naturally and were born to a Pulitzer Prize Winner and Bill Gates, well they can just combust...wow I'm really in a mean spirit today...or everyday just something new to bitch about  I want to be the Video Girl, for five days...just five days...the scantily clad, perfect bangs having, drop dead gorgeous just oogled at for her body and her next appearance in another video..you know the video girl...I want to know what it feels like to not have to say one thing...i'm making assumptions I know...but it's my wish, right...I'm taking the arrogance thing a little too far...I would just sit, smile, drape off of Jay-Z, cross and uncross my legs, adjust my skirt height occasionally with a random biting my french manicured fingers, and stare into a camera through Dior shades...Just five days, I'm sure I would be blogging after that again...with fewer words and maybe in this world fewer complaints.

      Without the shadow of a doubt, even if it makes me seem like the owner of a 1977 life with no headlights, film and documentaries seem to spell out the answers that I have always known, the problems I have always had, and the perverse which kinda hangs out in the background...  I sound like everyone else in this generation but really this weekend a solid 4 hours was spent totally absorbed into a screen, and totally wanting more, almost like motivational speeches from a mentor or a therapy session with a psychologist...I don't officially despise my father anymore, and I don't want to drop out of school.  Now, we can see the reference.  I watched Dogville, a three hour seemingly unrelenting film about a woman who just seemed like your run of the mill pushover, I related right away....actually, it's the last scene that got me, like at the 175th minute, this movie really had me by the &%$!.  Get out of Dogville, is all I could think how simple, just hide out somewhere just as you did 174 minutes ago, you don't have to go through this...turns out the victim/martyr role that Nicole Kidman played in this movie and that I play in my own full length feature film running slightly over 180 minutes, was really consumed with arrogance.  The fact that most of us let so much slip past our radars, doesn't imply that we really are shiny happy care free people, it's more the fact that standards moral, ethical, etiquette, courtesy, academic, professional, financial, emotional that we set for ourselves are well beyond what we expect from our neighbor, so why hold these people to the same flame.  We might actually consider ourselves on a higher level, capable of perfection whereas these "others" are only doing what conditions and circumstances have lead them to do...like we should appear so forgiving so easy going only because "poor guy, he just doesn't know what true love is, poor lady she may have had to live in NYC her whole life, so no wonder she's so icy and crass, oh poor boy with a family like that no wonder he behaves this way, oh poor girl, her parents neglected her so no wonder she chooses to sleep with every thing in possession of a dick."..I don't know it made me realize that if i were really equal with everyone else, and it's ironic because most would say i'm a pound or too short of a full bag of confidence, then i should be mad, and should demand my fair share, and should not be expected to be rewarded in some higher power fashion, because well i'm closer to God...I really don't know if I have to say it again, but it's a weird neuroticism that I may have introduced into my psyche, but I am arrogant with a cover of being devoid of a backbone....interesting...my father says that I need to be more like him..I resent that, a pompous demanding overachiever....but not anymore..how can I resent someone who I emulate just in a very distorted way, I want everything, but i wont step on some poor person's feet, because god only knows the traumas they have suffered these poor people who are so much worse off than me...where do I get off exactly....  Oh..and i'm not dropping out of school for sure now...not because medicine is where the undercover narcissists go, but because i watched this Discovery Health show tonight about residents, about how each person in this field is quirky, is stressed, is full of self doubt, is just plain guessing, feels overworked and underpayed, always wondering what they signed up for even at the point of residency, full of anguish in their personal lives (i.e. cheating husbands, boyfriends who beg that tonight something too traumatic won't happen to end the relationship...again...)coincidentally all the featured residents were women tonight..they were all so content with a day's work too, not content like I saved the world, but whoa I didn't have a breakdown because I was way too busy helping 20 people today...dude it sounds like my life at this very moment (minus the helping 20 people thing, I'm way too busy getting their Date of Births and Chief Complaints)...I simply don't belong anywhere else...not fabulous enough to be a lawyer, no poker skills to be in business, and simply not happy enough to be a teacher..however i guess anguish always serves as fuel for HOLLYWOOD...if all else fails...here I come....but for now, I love my future job...

      How do so many people gather the courage to grow up?  I used to be the jumpiest frog in the bunch always a second late to jump on adventure, autonomy and pure ACTION.  Little did I know that, with each leap meant that I would be farther and farther away from a big wet pond with a buffet of flies...  I moved away to school in Miami at fifteen, where i quickly learned that just because you are offered a shiny VISA (and a free T)doesn't mean that you have to vacation in the Keys.  You see I thought that this was the adventure, the autonomy the ACTION...Well, a few months later, with no incoming revenue, because of my rockstar schedule not accomodating for a part time job, I pawned my CD's and my CD player, for gas money to drive the 210 miles to get home, the big wet pond with a buffet of flies.  I flailed my arms and just complained for those three weeks about having no life, being restricted and having no support with regards to my accomplishments.  I mean it was hard work to get a 2.6 in Freshman year classes, and boy did I play up the age card..."Do you know how lonely it is for me, how much harder this transition is when you don't even have a driver's license?..all I really need is your support, how hard is that?  I just wish I was older?"  I moved off campus in 1996 - post the consecutive below 2.0 GPA grade reports, and decided school wasn't my thing and well...I could be an adult, get a job, love the job, make tons of money and never need an ounce of support that I wasn't relying on anyway, right and how did I ever pay those credit cards off... I worked, hard I might add, drawing and writing quippy ad campaigns for Air Jamaica and others to print on napkins, pens, etc...my dream job payed 6/hr, so I was slapped with eviction notices almost every other month, because well my rent seemed to be the last priority when it came to food, gas to get to my job and cable, oh and paper plates to eat my ramen noodles on, you see 6/hr just didn't stretch that far...another miserable attempt of taking the adult world by the horns.  So, i faired better as a Student, I mean the cafeteria was always open, and you just didn't get evicted. Hence the six year bachelor degree plan...I finished and was finally ready to do something with my life, despite how much I would miss the "OG" comments I would always hear underneath their breaths, I had to hop on into more school, this time on a sea bound rock.  "NO, I don't need your help to settle in Mom, God, I've been living on my own for how long now..God I'm 24 years old..."  Well, after the novelty of the place wore off, seconds after regaining consciousness from the nap on the plane there, I screamed "MUMMY!"  I'm a lot older now, a lot more responsible, I pay my bills when I get them, I put stamps on everything, and I give everyone my real social security number and name, use only debit cards, checks and cash, and the big and....I have a savings account....but I still can't figure out why every other day, there are kinks in plans..ruffles in attempts to be an adult...Someone lost the paperwork, We need a roomie ASAP, I have to go the grocery store, dry cleaners, and home depot to cut keys like hours ago, there's always gotta be toilet paper, and reorganize and clean closet days, I am so tired...This is the adventure, autonomy, the ACTION....  I'm here, a few lily pads away from my own pond, a few more hops, a few less hopes....All I need is enough flies here, I just couldn't go back to ramen...

      Where do my days go?  How can I be staring blankly at this site with nothing but wasteful thoughts that play sequel to where my mind wanders during the course of the day.    Scene 1: Crawling out of bed, taking a millisecond look in the mirror to make sure no new blemishes have added themselves to the most despised list, walking past the box of Marlboros many times until I cave, say good morning to the Mercedes Mechanic guy who lives downstairs and probably thinks I spend every night obliterated, considering it's 9 AM and I'm smoking already...spend thirty minutes dancing like a monkey in the kitchen with my favorite roomie discussing how I'm cutting down, only to realize I have twenty minutes to either go the gym and be late to school or just be late to school, depending on the day I can be found on a treadmill, but I am consistently late to school.  Scene 2:  I am standing side by side with my partner who is equally as blank and shell-like, propped against a faux oil painting that juts into my back.  We nod a lot, and place our hands in our pockets, under our arms, on our chins like clockwork when the doctor faces us to translate the last twenty minutes that has just transpired.  It feels like being yanked on your big toe while in a deep sleep, aware but unwilling to acknowledge this disturbance.  Scene 3:  Interludes to translation:  Sex, lots and lots of sex, old experiences, potential ones, What am I gonna wear tomorrow?  Did I finish writing that paper, Did I get this guy to sign my attendance sheet, I wonder if my wireless card will work today, Do I need tomatoes?  Do my roomates mind beef tonight?  How many cigs have I smoked today?  Has anyone texted me?  Did that loan come through?  sex lots and lots of sex, I've tried to dilute this but really it's disgusting, Dr. B turns to tell us that his patient has been feeling fatigued and dizzy probably due to some sort of anemia, and I can't detach from the thought of him nuzzling his nose in my neck...please...not close anemia would seem more gripping at this point.  Oh...he...he will probably turn up in one of these blogs eventually...the scenarios aren't so explicit, it's more like I'm reaching for spices in my kitchen fiddling between the smoked paprika and the garlic salt, and I feel him behind me, I feel him behind me...His breath is hot and my hairs stand on end...ANEMIA, we can't ever cross this point in the fantasy, I'm way too focused on feeling him behind me and the whole breath description.  There are also flashes of a hood of a car..hmmm.. I wish I had more, but I've become bashful as I've written this...so, for now..ANEMIA

      So, it's not just here apparently that my name has been in use over so many years, it's hotmail, it's friendster, it's even velvetlist.com, the reasons for which I tried to subscribe seem intensely embarrassing and so I will beg no further judgement be made, noone likes to pay cover charges buddy.  I have to add letters, symbols and numbers until my name has become so distorted that I'm sure I'll never again remember a sign in name creating a vicious cycle of sorts.  "What was my sign in again? Oh, forget it, I'll just create another one...what do you mean there is already a dddppaee77#!, damnit.."  The frustration is not limited to cyberworlds. Let's take my present educational situation, taking me from one venue to another over the course of the next year, what does this mean to you as a reader, well, it means that you are probably even more confused as to why this should matter so much.  I have to get new ID badges each time I move from one place to another, because god forbid the fact that I am first and foremost a student, and lastly a lowly scut monkey who is temporarily under the service of the hospital.  NO, it's imperative I have six different ID badges with my name presented in so many colorful block, and script letters in, did I fail to mention every morphed version of the spelling of my name...I have a simple name, not Joe or Ann, but i can only imagine what life must be like in the name game for these people, and well..I miss it...I even appreciate when my mother calls me by my full name, every consonant devoid of any underscores or extra P's...  You see this foils my plans for ever becoming famous, if someone ever mistakes my complaining and sarcasm for some brilliant work, they'll only know my pen name, which is a result of adding signs and characters until clicking on "Continue" takes you to the next screen.  It is nothing like the days of old when a pen name was representative of something a conjured pseudo-personality maybe, and well you would be able to write to them and request a manuscript for publishing.  They'll never be able to reach me because my e-mail address requires a graphing calculator to store the length of characters and pound signs.  Well, this was a hypothetical problem...very hypothetical, and hardly likely but I just miss my name..

      I just barely escaped with my life only a few moments ago...I was smoking a cig, supposedly from the last pack me and the Armenian have agreed on buying...when all of a sudden there it was, the biggest yellow jacket I have ever seen...   I'm not sure if I can be held accountable for what crossed my mind at this point because it was sheer fear...but I had the likes of a ninja, with one eye steadfastedly gazing into the bee's six thousand eyes, and the other on the length of the cigarette in my mouth...all of a sudden it seemed like a Marlboro Ultralight 100, grew inches before my eyes...   But I refused to let this yellow jacket make a yellow belly out of me...so I continued with my cross eyed gaze..before i knew it...he (had to be a he...didn't have the likes of a queen) swooped into the apartment.&nbsp; I was conflicted, do I put this cig out run inside and warn the Armenian and Yeah man&nbsp;(new roomie),&nbsp; or do I save myself by staying outside on the patio forever?&nbsp; Before I could answer this moral dilemna for myself, God, Murphy, fate brought the answer into the picture for me with the arrival of yet another yellow jacket onto the patio bannister....Fuck...in a city with so much concrete, and not a colorful blossom in sight, we seemed to look like a hive...Fuck   I put it out...the bastards had won...I slid in through the barely ajarred patio door, and then I heard it, the bzzzz the bastard was taunting me...He was just between the glass and the curtain, I trapped him there, shutting the curtains firmly from an arm's length away....because you know the curtain is as effective as Raid...whatever...   "Armenian?"&nbsp; I said quite loudly, what would happen if I let a bee in?&nbsp; He's laughing incessantly and slowly shuttles the bee outside...turns to me and says ."Everyone's ok, no one's hurt, break it up, go home everybody."&nbsp; I'm lucky I got away with 3/4 of a smoke and no stinger in my ass...

      Even though I can't take back time, and I would never wish for my circumstances to be any different than they are right now, I do wish for this much...  I wish progression didn't go hand in hand with expecting so much out of life and loved ones.&nbsp; With all the changes that I see unfolding along with those already experienced, I can't help but remember times when my brain was pacified by thoughts of living in a hut by the beach, smoking, and fishing all day long.&nbsp; I used to have such admiration for the simplest of things life had to offer, for instance, if I just got into med school, if I just could lose some poundage, if I could just bask in the sun and never go hungry, if my heart could only be clean and pure, and if my only expectation of people around me was to be happy and be happy with me.&nbsp; Even my choices in men were more grounded based on the mere fact that they possessed ideals that I respected, they really didn't even have to respect me...this may account for the jaded product that types before you....  Now...well, now peace comes in different flavors for me...I don't want material things, although they would be nice, but the pacifist that once existed in me is faced with my other side, the one that roots the underdog on, the one that empathizes with problematic psych patients who are unruly or undisciplined.&nbsp; My ideals I realize now, are genuinely open for discussion, not open for the sake of being called, "open minded" or relaxed.&nbsp; I can see why a child would curse at his mother insistently, after being compared to a sibling or being abused himself.&nbsp; I could see why a group of angry children would want to ridicule an outsider, because he instigates 90% of the trouble these little big boys get into.&nbsp; The budding rastafarian (funny pun if I do say so myself) has been smothered in me...I want to be a survivor, a fighter who doesn't take being taken advanatage of lightly, whose pet peeve is a man who shows no respect for me.  I still want a hut on the beach but only after I've worked very hard and deserve a life with no worries...although I can't guarantee that complaining won't tag along for the ride.&nbsp; If my heart can be free of guilt for hurting another intentionally then this is much more appealing than steering clear of all evil...meaning in life sometimes the right thing just shouldn't be done unless you're willing to sacrifice your own well being.&nbsp; I've lost my genuine interest in people, for the sake of clarity, I mean I can't even see myself attached to very much, tears seem useless, attachment seems useless, and caring to the point where I used to seems useless...  My parents always said with age, practicality would overrun the passion, the drive that used to bring me to tears to hear someone else in trouble...I'm not sure if I like the trade-off yet..

      In one amazing shot, vacations, I realize just don't suit me.&nbsp; I just got over a three week span of nothingness after being in constant motion since may of 2002. &nbsp; Does this mean that without school, I'm devoid of interesting things to do?&nbsp; Possibly, considering that "to do" always involved a chapter, a patient write up, or a clinic assignment, paying bills, visiting the salon, working out and shopping for groceries for my belly and my feet..shoes are essential...Regardless, I'm back to the grind and loving it.. &nbsp; &nbsp; Have you ever found yourself, making conversation, like really making conversation..like from a ball of clay molding&nbsp;a sculpture of the most intricate sorts, why has it become so difficult to relate to people..I used to thrive on this the fact that with a few of&nbsp;the right questions I was hooked&nbsp;on a person and what they had to say, now it seems tiring and not worth the effort. &nbsp; I&nbsp;wanted to write this one down before it became a good idea gone to waste: &nbsp; He says imagine a couple so deeply in love, that effortless stuff I've&nbsp;written about&nbsp;before,&nbsp;then one day without notice, reason or fail they end on the ugliest of terms with flying centerpieces and shattered glass.&nbsp; Many a tear filled sleepless night would have passed running playbacks of scenes from their relationship, but as&nbsp;time runs as well, the memory will tire leaving a&nbsp;vague blurry vision.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several years pass, and each in their own respective lives begins to have dreams bringing these visions back into focus, but the dreams are not luscious or loving.&nbsp; They are of wrought iron contorted into malformed objects and steel cages becoming malleable under the force of&nbsp;a guard rail...perhaps an accident of some sort...&nbsp;one of the two of these characters is forced to a hault on one day's commute form work, and emergency vehicles have crammed both sides of a bridge...They get out of their cars and with enough courage decide to go and aid the victims of the accident...only to find??? He stopped there....A likely candidate for a great novel by a great author, when he finds the time and the courage... &nbsp;

      How can you dislike someone you've never met ever?  Well, I'd like to attest to the fact that it's possible....  Nothing stupendous or productive happened today, so, I decided as my outing for the evening why not go to the gym and try and shed the few pounds I put on since being forcefed through guilt by my loving aunts.  There it was the usually packed parking lot with an attendant who flags people into obviously empty parking spots and the ones creatively sculpted from the dumpster being moved around by the garbage trucks.  It was empty today, I suppose the rain and lightning makes the treadmill seem like an unlikely choice.  Anyways the usual ritual of searching for the sign up sheet for the treadmill seemed pointless as there appeared to be a total of five people in the gym, so I started stretching and began running...  My routine was coming to an end, the part of the workout where I call myself names and keep picturing life without the extra pounds...when he shows up...that guy, Cud guy, only because he chews his Gatorade gum like a cow.  I had seen him before, he's gotta be like 35, Arab or maybe Indian I don't know, with a heavy mustache, in pretty good shape.  The thing that stands out in his persona is his attitude, he walks with a towel slung over his shoulder, he pushes his way to everything, despite the five people in the gym, and he rarely makes eye contact with anyone.  My first eye witness account of his cocky attitude was when he tapped some old lady on the shoulder and without saying a word, pointed her off the lat machine...dude, pointed her off, like index finger to her and then thumb to the open empty gym floor, the whole time chewing his damn gum like his name was Arthur Bally.  Then he puts the pin in the hole of the lat machine at a level which would have read "I really want my neck veins to rupture, really" or somewhere around 190lbs, either way his gum chewing escalated to beyond cow-like, he got the weight up but believe me I was holding my phone just in case.  This guy had the nerve, anyways I know rules are rules, but I mean with one other person occupying one of the fourteen treadmills I really don't see the need for this invisible confrontation.  He stands at the foot of my treadmill, and I catch his eye in the mirror which faces the machine, he folds his arms, chews so loud I can hear it over the motor, whistles...YES...and then nods...YEAH...I didn't even get the finger..haha...I got nodded off  So, being as he could smoosh me with his calf, I stop running...gather my stuff, and get off...not even a nod to say thanks I guess....

      Ok, so I had heard all the warnings, been told that Michael Moore had mastered the art of creating films that could shift whole psyches, that his genius was merely another form of propaganda, and I had made myself aware of the fact that a trade off with being open minded is the fact that you are always impressionable...  So, I saw 9/11, only weeks after most of American youth, I have been disturbed in many other ways but this uneasiness is different.  I had been one of those people who read every piece of literature I could find in print post 9/11 to try to find the reason for the heinous attacks, try to find that one US News article that would compress fifteen years or so and describe the events which lead up to these acts.  I have always found that fundamentalists of any faith, although sitting on the far left or right of a see saw always had profound principles; methodical, philosophical, religious, and steadfast grounds for most decisions that are made. In a far reach, I grew to respect these motives, meaning they were fueled by much more than personal gain or wealth.  I will never understand why besides wealth, people only also respond to violence and humiliation, and therefore my respect stopped at just that respect, not admiration or alliance with these actions.  In debates that would follow, and ones that still sprout every so often, I would say why should we wonder why our country would be so infamous, there are countless caves in which our enemies could be born.  America has shown a disregard for principle, hardly held to its word, and scarcely remained loyal.  This movie was an eye - openner in a different respect though...  As a country we have been blindfolded, spun around and sent to find the pinata.  Wealth and opportunity run rampant here, and to my luck it is even available to me, a minority woman.  The beauty in this land lies here along with freedoms that are neatly trimmed around the edges but for the most part freedoms none the less.  There is a price though...the rich will remain rich, by any means necessary, and the poor will always remain poor.  The closing arguments in the movie described the necessity of this hierarchy to achieve the world power status that we hold as a nation.  Most of our causes are futile ones, our arguments, weak ones, and we are blindly lead to believe that our government is in place to aid the people (including underserved populations) vs. maintaining this hierarchy in the country and the superego complex that we feed in order to rule the world through domination.  There has been so much smoky confusion put in place (loophole after loophole), that it's hard to notice the caniving nature of the ruling body and this movie just brought to light the fact that we, the public as a unit, have all been victimized in some way, while others fueled not by principle but by personal gain seem to be winning the race.  The world has suffered by the hand of these manipulations with unnecessary loss of life, destruction of cities, and enforced poverty....  I was just left uneasy, I wanted to try to dupe them back, legitimately, the ideas involved sacrifice giving up any dream of truly becoming a disgustingly wealthy woman with many shoes, so damnit...for now I'll rock the vote...

      So I used to have to take this class where we learned about different personality types, how each patient could present, and how to in turn be able to have a healthy conversation in order to properly diagnose someone...  There were clusters, each category having a particular hallmark you would look for, and disorders that were common to each cluster...  Background being set...since this class I've analyzed everyone I know in order to have healthy conversations, minus diagnosis:  Cluster A: Hallmark includes an avoidance of social relationships, with a "weird" nature, but not psychotic, These people generally have psychotic disorders like pshizophrenia  You've got your  Paranoid Type:  Distrustful, suspicious, their problems are generally everyone else's fault - haven't met anyone like this yet...and if you think I'm going to devulge my analysis on this thing...you are CRAZY (not one of the documented types listed below) I'm listing them to eventually describe a textbook case that I met on my last rotation...dude..anyways you also have,  Schizoid:  long standing loners  Schizotypal:  the guys or girls with the garland of flowers on their head with every belief in the world that they are the princesses of a land called Unicorn and they've been married to an alien, basically magical thinking with odd thought patterns or behavior.  Cluster B:  Hallmark being dramatics, emotional or inconsistent, generally these guys have mood disorders and are substance abusers...your run of the mill heroin fiends   Now in this cluster we have your Histrionic - need I say more than this...every guy or girl you have ever met who is just inches away from your face ALL the time, hands are always actively waving (the patented forearm to forehead - poor me - move), and they are not afraid to stick an occasional tongue in your ear.  This is the girl I met over these last few months, and no, she did not stick her tongue in my ear.  Anyways, part of our exam in this class was an oral exam in which on of these personality types would be played by a patient and it was our job was to appropriately handle the situation...needless to say, I never learned how to handle this one, if a patient ever hit on me..I'd probably turn orange, that's the color we turn, and diplomatically refer them to another doctor.  It is described in a textbook as the Don Juan in men and the "life of the party" for women...  Narcissistic - the person who assumes we were all born to serve them and this is the person who assumes that noone else's dilemna's could be half as heart wrenching, so why bother listening at all...lacks any empathy  Antisocial - the kid who burned ants with a magnifying glass and hit frogs with tennis rackets...the arsen, the bully, no concern for social norms whatsoever...associated with criminal behavior in adulthood.  Borderline - the cutter, the erratic, impulsive person who solves every problem with an overdose attempt.  Then...there's  Cluster C:  Hallmark is a fearful anxious person usually suffering from anxiety disorders in adulthood ******************ME****************SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE************************************************  These guys include the  Avoidant - This is the person who says, "Well, since you guys aren't paying attention to me, because I'm of no consequence, I'll just stand here and face the wall and pout."  Obsessive-Compulsive - Goes without saying...famous for, "What do you mean, the Alphabet Soup should be first in line in the cupboard, it starts with "A".  Dependent - The people who call someone everytime a new pack of gum needs to be purchased, because their choice would never suffice....  Passive-Aggressive - OK ME - these words straight from the textbook, summarize impeccably, "Outward compliance, but inward defiance", sure I would love to do that for you no problem ****insert inner thoughts here******stupid bitch, you've never done anything but make me miserable, you've got serious delusions if you think I would....OK, I'll just do it**************  And that concludes our class in the Characteristics of the basic personality Disorders...With all this typing...I've forgotten my initial reason for explaining all this, oh yeah...the Glimmerman, that's her name...clever manipulation of just one letter would reveal her true identity but...  Ok, so the first day I met her she spoke through me, you know, like asked questions just because she already had a dissertation of an answer ready to fire back at me...I knew this would be fun...she had begun her diet of yogurt and grapes, and she loved telling me how her newborn was doing so well, making his mark on every developmental stage and how she was such a good mother and how this was just her way of getting back into shape...my only response was that she had tried and true dedication to her profession, that to undertake such responsiblities as a student, wife and now a mother were burdens that I respected her for taking on, she was beautiful for just having done what I wish I had the courage and heart to undertake...she blushed and patted me on the head...skipping along to the salad bar..  The weeks progressed we both signed onto the same team for group projects, etc....While most of us were consumed with completing paper work, she got experiences that we see on TV, the entire ER season one....which she didn't fail to constantly remind us of....why was she alotted this luck, she left her paperwork till the end (which ended up being a very intelligent move), and gave up her newborn to a nanny and spent countless hours wedged between some intern's butt cheeks...with questions like what are you doing now, where are you going now, can I come with you now, show me what you're doing now....she was never shy, I watched her in action, she shot winks at the poor newly migrated Indian men who were probably enchanted with the feeling of a set of lips on their asses, regardless, she got her way.  When it came time for our "group projects", only one person helped, not her if you're quick...one of my partners is a new immigrant from Russia, who used to practice medicine there under the influence of vodka and tatu CD's, so he was useless, and she, well, she had now become the owner of bags under her eyes, and a shrunken frame from her misguided diet...she complained of always being too dizzy...too tired...too stressed out...way toooo busy.....see, we weren't ALL doing this rotation with ALL the same responsibilities, we were all vacationing in Ibiza until our projects were due...point being she should probably eat SOMETHING....go home once in a while...and stop being so freaking overproductive...but I replied with oh Glimmerman...we probably will never understand the hardships you undergo, ofcourse you don't have to do a thing (I was being sarcastic, apparently played the part so well, she thought I wasn't kidding) and Glimmerman, gosh...you look so good...so thin it's like you're swimming in your white coat...woman, what have you lost now 15 no 20lbs?????? she blushed patted me on the head and went off to the salad bar to re-affix her face to some intern's butt....  Weeks progressed even more...Glimmerman, had become scarcely available, spending almost twelve hours a day in the hospital...but she did however find me every afternoon at the hour of noon to complain CONSTANTLY...about ANYTHING..how her colleagues (i.e. all of us) were incompetent, how doctors (i.e.  people years advanced to us) were incompetent, how they stressed her out...she would pull me aside, from our colleagues, and whisper like an old woman all these nasty things about anything...and then say well..I'm just going to skip lunch, you know gotta watch my figure...waiting with an ear perked like Wile E. Coyote, for me to say, Gosh...you're wasting away, you know how us girls love being compared to anorexics...  Glimmerman, oh Glimmerman..I ran into her today two weeks post rotation....she pulled me aside again...just to complain, speak of some new intern she has a crush on...and then asked how she looked...I replied...Gosh, Glimmerman...you look so relaxed, so thin, god...how much weight have you lost...she blushed patted me on the head and asked me to keep in touch as she went skipping along to the salad bar....

      I've gotta get back to NY as soon as possible, oh god when did that become a sanctuary?  I'm not deprived by any means or even chained to a wall with a dog dish for sustinence as I've made my current status seem to be...I'm just tired of being politically correct oh who am i kidding I miss never having to pop out the second story screen on the window, so I can smoke a cig...  So, it's been weeks, or realistically maybe just days you know since I've had a decent conversation with him....I would normally be typing away privately from some hotmail account, but I've been banned from using this form of communication...for the following reasons..1.)  put it like this if my child was missing, I'd probably just plan the funeral and skip the search party antics - translation:  I assume the worst, no room for having a bad day irrespective of me, actually nothing to do with me... 2.)  if I was a boxer, I'd hold up my opponent's glove and just consistently plant it square on the jaw, and bite my own ear off - translation:  I create my own dilemnas that seem insurmountable, my own worst enemy...how can anyone else solve my own problems..without medication..hmmmm 3.)  If there were a slight escalation in the wind velocity, I've grabbed my keys headed to the nearest grocery store, picked up bottled water, batteries, and a first aid kit...I've turned off all my fuses and I sit in the dark till the "storm" arrives - translation:  in addition to number 1, any small change, minor alteration in routine,  probably means everything's gone to shit...to hell...to the heaps of shit in hell. 4.)  If I got a tattoo that said "Om", the next week it would say "mOm", she would probably piss me off, and I would change it to "mOmOney", then I'd get sick of Puffy dancing the background of everyone else's videos and it would change to "mahOgany" (I don't know I ran out of creative manipulations)..point being, oh I mean - translation:  I AM FICKLE..., so e-mails conveying sentiments are not allowed, the running joke is this week I like him, but who knows depending on the weather, I may not ever speak to him again...ok so maybe it's more stable now..like I'll never not speak to him (this does not guarantee against foul four lettered words), and I'll never not have him in my life (he may be my future investor, or business partner, who knows)...  So, because he reads this...this is my passive aggressive stab at conveying, "I miss him, and sometimes my sadness translates into fiery e-mails..."..haha...  Oh yeah, a testament to just how fickle I am, in addition to the other three attributes previously described...read previous entries...

      Storms brew differently here in the Midwest...  The cliche, "the thunder rolls" is damn near pin point precision...The clouds are purple, at sunset at least, and they tumble through the sky..So, I was watching "Who wants to marry my Dad?" (because my life lacks reality) when those annoying orange banners creeping along the bottom of the screen insisted on reminding me that we were all going to die sometime between the hours of 9-11PM, due to some tornado watch.  My brother and my cousin run outside so they can play Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton and save Peoria...every five minutes they would update me on the color of the sky...  Unusual for ,my normally, paranoid self I stayed spray painted to their couch, praying that Meredith would pass the lie detector test on the show...she had great hair...Then, the sirens went off, loud tortuous alarms saying,"wooh woooh wooooooh."  I jumped up, looked around, said to myself, where would I anchor myself incase winds exceeding 120mph were suddenly in my face...I asked my cousin where to run in the event of an evacuation..he responded with what siren, what evacuation, scenario could've been compared to car alarms going off in any major city or a woman screaming help in the darkness....  Well, 11PM passed and noone died....rain and lightning continued till morning when the siren went off again at 9AM...I ran downstairs and everyone is seated around the dining table drinking tea or coffee, my aunt smiles and says ," OH..that's the testing system for the tornado warning siren goes off every first tuesday of every month..."  what a relief, huh???

      I saw her gliding through the crowd like she always did, the patented wave and kiss on the cheek to every notable in the room...God..how did she always do it, this time when I reached out to her, it was different..  Our interaction began with the scripted formalities one extends to every Indian person one ever meets (I've decided that if one more person asks so what do you do...I'm going to tell them I work in underserved communities as a graffiti artist and have you seen my latest work on the Goethal's Bridge - it's what the baby on Biggie's Ready to Die grew up to look like, since he's really my kid)...I'm going to call her Sweat, it's not a far reach from her real name..my cousin, the one chick that stood as the standard, so I secretly grew to love hating her.  She never did a thing but be herself, stunning, intelligent, sarcastic, and just plain fun.  Without ever knowing it, I think parents instigate the imaginary feuds that come from constantly comparing two things.  Point being, my dad and Sweat tag teamed the wrestling match I had with my self esteem growing up as a kid and hell even now...  This time it was different when I reached out to her...I hugged her in her beautiful condo which faces both the river and the city of Chicago...stunning..some things do not change...She had the likes of a movie star who just threw on designer jeans and a tank with pieces of jewelry that in certain lights were sure to sear my retina...but the point being, we ate at a crab shack where noone knew how to crack the crab, so we moved on to crab cakes, the work's already done, we drank domestic beers, went to eighties bars where trucker hats, fooseball, and get this ping pong kept us entertained till dawn...we laughed so hard, the whole clan is just hilarious...then she talked to me (alcohol may be a reality blocker, but it has openned up so many roads of communication that I would never trade ever), she, the most independent sharp witty woman I know, is looking for a love, that doesnt feel like a burden, like obligation does not exist...her father has been diagnosed with Parkinson's and she describes the way her mother without even thinking has taken care of him, with a whole heart and not an ounce of resentment...how many people can do this she asked..I want to love someone like that, and be loved like that, tears began to well in the corners of both of our eyes...I said then with all the other things being exactly as you wished for, don't settle for just any functional form of love...live to meet the love of your life...we both cried...tears of the sad reality that this may never happen for either one of us, and my tears had hints of joy for finally letting go of resentment and jealousy...

      You know when you look in the mirror and you see this one mark, that you try to get off with spit, then you go to the bathroom sink and try your washcloth, and then you're completely submerging your whole head in a soak of skin bleach just to see it disappear....I feel like that sometimes, trying to get the monkey off of my back would be an understatement...  I have tried to unravel the roots of this self esteem issue by digging in every forest that I've ever been lost in...I see everything that is beautiful, warm, attractive, positive in so many people, I see it that shine that everyone has and I'm never afraid of the glittery glare.  For each great thing I find in someone else, I find the one missing memo that completes my own self-loathing file.  It's ugly too, the file feeds off of meeting bigger and better people, so that destroys all hopes I have in moving into higher circles and being comfortable there.  I look around in awe with slumped posture at all the amazing people that grace this planet...I try to emulate their actions, their words, their alcoholic beverage of choice, this only seems more pathetic...I have opinions, strong ones, even regarding the shoes I wear, or the state of the nation, but I'm scared to step away from the crowd with my orange shoes, because me with my stand alone opinions and fashion statements would just be ridiculed...but this is what constitutes leadership and confidence..why should I be afraid to order a rasberry kamikaze, even though everyone is in a mojito/or vodka mood...  I've tried to figure out my faults, list them, methodically (contributing to a very BIG section in the file mentioned before) and "work" on them...this approach works because logistically on paper I have no complaints, I'm professionally, physically, morally, financially, right on the GO on the Monopoly board..but it's in my head that needs "work"...It's like I need to keep playing self help phrases on tape to hear that "you are ok...you don't need to be perfect...you should embrace the shortcomings...you are ok..."

      Slowly but surely every circle comes back to its beginning...I always end up here, that area in my mind where I rarely want to venture....  It's hard for me to come to terms with the fact that my moods can be described as polar, bi- , tri-, or quadruple still yet to be judged....My highs are wicked highs, I can charm a fortune right out of a cookie, and noone or nothing can dent this feeling...My lows are gruesome lows, where I can walk hand in hand with anxiety attacks over the simplest of things, from grocery shopping to cooking, to working out in the gym...  It has been said that each student in this profession has some element of obsessive compulsive disorder...harping over details that eventually compel one to be unmoved from a single task..the sole reason that reading chapter after chapter until the exam is done seems realistic....  I wish I could find the courage sometimes to seek a psychiatrist, not for therapy, but just for their mere power to prescribe.  A mood stabilizer that would leave me baseline all the time...but the costs scare me...granted without insurance the prices can seem infinite, but what I really meant was that in the end...I would trade off the wicked highs too.  The lows at my age are recognizable as surmountable, as ending very soon, but at my age the highs also come with the thought of impending doom all the time.  I am also the type of person who becomes depressed without excitement, wrinkles in my linen, missing pieces in a puzzle, so with medication, I would end up depressed I think.  Imagine if I could never react appropriately, with sadness, anger, happiness, or ecstasy, if it all were somehow numbed.  I can't survive in a box without doors or an open top, I would suffocate, I have to be able to escape the norms in order to thrive....  What breeds a being like this...I know my character flaws, but I don't know where they come from?  how to prevent someone else from feeling like this?  See, at this very moment, things are so defined down to a timetable that I feel trapped, and therefore depressed.  I can't actually believe I did this but this morning I woke up late PURPOSELY...took my time, drank a cup of coffee as if I didn't have lips, spilt it on my shirt so I had to get dressed again, smoked a cigarette, and then jumped in my car and sped through traffic, weaving in and out...driving recklessly, running to my floor so as I wouldn't be late...slipped in ninja style...rushed through paper work that was over an hour late, but finished it so I could revel in my version of "living on the edge"...I could have potentially been yelled at, made to look like a fool, but I risked it so I could be prepared despite being late, so I could get a rush from the challenge...who does this....and is conscious of it??????

      I don't know who that other blogger was who wished that they were oogled at for even five seconds...she must have used my password and hacked into this oh so personal website...  Ok...demonstration of fickle-ness number three thousand and four.... On a construction site in the middle of a fully functional hospital, didn't know this filled health codes, but I guess it's all within regulations...the old cliche of greasy construction guys cat calling women needs an updated more perverse version...I find myself two feet from some man in kneeling before his century marker on the life ticker, who thinks that incessantly turning his power drill on and off is somehow supposed to make me think of making sweet love to him right there in the elevator.  Oh, but the kicker...he's licking the three hour old mash potatoes off of his crusty lips, so what...so I could feverishly make icky squishy in my underpants...NO....he proceeds to place the drill near my ear and tell me that he would love to do things to me...like what build me a bird house, lay some pipe...oh god....I wish if I did have a feverish overwhelming feeling it would have been because I, either slapped the potatoes right off of his face, stuck the drill up his nose hole making him devoid of a midbrain, or lastly jump on him and returned his sexual aggression because we all know half the enjoyment is the power issue and the other half is knowing that an aggressive woman is no longer attractive but psycho....  And yeah man, my new roomate...well, no matter what I try to wear, short of a turtleneck, if I catch this guy fixated on me pouring cereal into a bowl or using the remote control once more, I'm going to ask him to leave...well, at the end of this month, on a fixed loan income, we all have our price....He's never been within this proximity of a girl like ever...poor guy....I should be empathetic and I think that's where I stood about two weeks ago...but now, on top of today....I feel like putting pork in his figs and almonds...  And Poopie pants, my patient, the youngest patient on the ward, cute round chubby boy about twice my size, ok...he has a liking for turnovers....tickled me...like reached behind me, a woman more than twice his age, who is his professional therapist...says i'm cute and have I ever heard of a blow job....I walked away....to find him a few hours later, giggling....again with the blow job business...I flipped..some therapist right?  I said, "Noone here is nice to you, I try to treat you like a normal kid...like respect you, and you talk to me like I'm some kid on the streets...I'm more than two times your age, show some respect...and that's it, this is all very inappropriate and I'm not talking to you anymore...."   I'm not talking to you anymore...this is my response when me and my little brother fight...this is my response to kids who called me names back in grade school...this is my response to a psychologically disturbed 12 year old boy who poops in his pants....I apologized...We worked on our "boundaries"....but after today....or tomorrow when he's discharged...I'm not talking to him anymore.....  I'm never wishing for anything anymore, not when a penny falls into my palm near a well, not when candles are being lit on my birthday cake, not when Shaq appears as my genie...never...Oogled by cute boys, with big hearts, and sharp wits, totally different from an oogle just to oogle...I'm more self conscious...I avoid eye contact...I'm repulsed to be honest....so, after today.....

       urlLink Five of Wands  (reversed)  in the Lesson position  Position Meaning  The card in this position offers a bottom line message that reflects what you might need to learn or fully comprehend before you can derive maximum benefit from your present situation.   Positional Interpretation   Five of Wands, in this position, suggests the importance of the cliché "be prepared". There is a process that needs to be followed in order to become successful in whatever you chose to do in your life. "Winging" it, waiting for it, or hanging on the sidelines, can’t offer the same interaction, training, or practice needed to learn to work well, or socialize among your peers, with those of the same gender, or within your field of interest. It is important to get out there and do it, not just talk about it. Getting hung up on petty annoyances only serves to waste or scatter energy, and might tend to make you irrational. Victory comes from skill, direct experience, perseverance, focused energy or adrenalin, healthy rivalry, and readiness, not luck. Excess within control.   Five of Wands. Card Interpretation   The Five of Wands is Strife or Practice, and it can represent the unrest or a turning point that can lead to confrontation, which can result in either altercation or renewal. Specific examples of this can be seen in children whose play has become rough or hurtful, in shoppers at a major sale, in a couple whose roughness turns to passion, or in the mental work that drives you to conquer, overcome, or get carried away. By the same token, it can be seen in the control and efforts to imitate that can foster growth, learning, or maturity, such as the "play" seen in young chimps as they try to mimic their elders.  The Five of Wands asks that you recognize that everyone has issues, is different, and may need Grounding from time to time. The question is; do you want to get in the middle of the fray, or can you do something to bring organization, clarity, or harmony to the situation? This card also suggests that turning to outside council or advice could keep you from being caught off guard.

      So, there might be opportunities for a medical student to make some money on the side... I might be able to say goodbye to fixed incomes and no savings because of limited loan funds....  If I can draw blood, collect urine, and check vital signs of middle aged couples in search of life insurance, I can wave goodbye to all these things...  My life sucks...as of this moment it really really sucks...my gums itch...I've gained like four pounds from merely drinking water with lots and lots of sushi, I'm surrounded by the negativity of two dueling roomates, one of which who fights with his fiancee every night over wedding details, and then chooses to share these feelings because god only knows that's what I really want to hear, is all the matrimonial bliss talk...everyday, I am potentially at risk for being attacked by overzealous psychiatry patients..today it was almost being decapitated by a connect four board....I have no friends outside of medicine, so basically, coversation can only run the gammet of blood draws, urine collection, vital signs, and other students potentially being decapitated, a recap of what I am loathing at this point...I don't see the light....not even a small night one...I am drawn to a character who thinks that I'm way too mushy, and I think my calls are even starting to smother him...I don't even know what to talk about anymore, because my days are so blooming boring....I went to a dreamy club in the clouds this weekend, and spent an hour smoking, an hour dancing, an hour surrounded by good looking guys who were all intelligent, and guess what all were in medicine...but what card did I pull the one where I'm totally turned off by anything medically related, so basically any line these guys would pull..."I'm a resident...I'm in my first year of residency...I really know what it's like in your shoes, I could give you some good advice...here's my number...blah, blah, blah..", I refuted with a resounding..."I'm dropping out..not interested."   I'm not really dropping out, maybe mentally I am....as in...outside of studying on my own, or being in a hospital mandatorily, or working for this life insurance gig...I'm not in medicine, I'm actually a free lance anything else....  I work out, I could train for a marathon, but with my addictive/perfectionist personality...I would begin to think 24 miles and 96 lbs. just wouldn't cut it... I watch movies, I could go to more independent film opennings....but with who, a lesbian interested in, "picking up chicks",  the Armenian, who thinks being sensitive is beating the other personalities out of pschizophrenics, the new "doctors" I just met, so I can listen to them rave about my grave future, or my one female counterpart...who is surgically attached to her boyfriend, and therefore more blissful matrimonial bullshit...maybe the one little guy who had a rotation with me who had great taste in books and food, might be fun, but surprisingly, he's a little too philosophical for my tastes...I love to be abstract, but what's fun about discussing life's truths...my blog is all I really need....maybe the new girls I met on this rotation in Psychiatry...one of whom has a weird conspiracy theory neurosis, involving a serious problem with trust and who always assumes I'm hiding something...one of whom could be a man, I'm not sure....one of whom talks about one thing all the time, no seriously, all the time...one of whom has the most perfect life, as previously discussed in another blog, well, she is that perfect Indian girl....maybe she would rub off on me and destroy my plot to be the black sheep forever....who's got the neuroses now??  YOu know what..maybe it's noone else's fault but my own...meaning I used to be the type who could revel in being compatible with all of these aforementioned personalities, but lately, I'm just tired...tired of trying, so without effort I can only hope to redefine loneliness....  I could go to the beach in these last remaining weeks of summer here in the city...but why would I purposefully want to contract some fungal infection or step on someone's used needle, the beaches are a festering microbial playground here....the Jersey Shore is just not that accessible...  I could play sports since playing tennis involves an hour commute and court fees that amount to only thirty dollars an hour, or play golf, at a course also one hell of a commute with huge course fees, but I could join my neighbors for a friendly game of handball....sounds attractive right?  Oh what am I complaining about...I get to go to some obscure openning of a movie this week and I'm going to see a show next week, and I'm going to the Park this weekend to partake in some South Asian networking thing...volunteering and hoping this will take the edge off of desperacy when I meet other people outside of medicine, because you us South Asians, so diverse in our career choices...great....  anyone...anyone wanting to trade boring seemingly lonely existence in Queens, for a life unchartered and full of spontaneity....

       What I hope:   Oceans of Envy I’ve got a photo booth picture It reminds me of something you said to me If everything you want is so far out of reach If everything you want is so far out of reach Move a little closer to meI did a perfect imitation of someone who’s alive Before I met you Now colors seem to have a taste and a temperature And everything doesn’t seem so far away Forever feels like it’s never going to be enough Held my breath as the water rushed in I was drowning in the man I use to be A castaway but you were there for me Held my breath as the water rushed in I was falling through a faded memory Castaway and you were there for me   What I could be:   Bark No Bite  I can’t let you go Don’t let the dark Be the only place you see me I’ll try to find you something new That pulls me back to your arms Little towns are the way we’re living Little white crosses on dangerous curves Everyone’s just dying to get out They got skills but forgot the nerve Turns me on when you turn me down Everything inside me turned around You’ve been tried and you’ve been true And I know that pulled me through I don’t mind you don’t know where you’re going I want to go with you All the things you thought you handed down They don’t shine like they shine for you I remember your phoenix shut it’s eyes And scratched it into my shoulder Like everything I wish would die Repeats itself over and over Have I tried? Am I true? Did the things I said I’d never do All that faith and luck and trust If it’s not real it turns to rust It turns me on when you say your mine All the things I thought I’d never find Your attention has it’s price But it’s never bark no biteI can’t stand the way you tell it Turns me on when you turn me down Everything inside me turns around Give me faith and love and trust Or just crush me into dust I’m not afraid to pay your price Because you’re never bark no bite   What I know still exists:   Cumbersome  she calls me goliath and i wear the david mask i guess the stones are coming too fast for her now you know I'd like to believe this nervousness will pass all the stones that are thrown are building up a wall I have become cumbersome to this world I have become cumbersome to my girl I'd like to believe we could reconcile the past resurrect those bridges with an ancient glance but my old stone face can't seem to bring her down she remembers bridges, burns them to the ground I have become cumbersome to this world I have become cumbersome to my girl too heavy too light, too black or too white, too wrong or too right, today or tonight cumbersome too rich or too poor, she's wanting me less and I'm wanting her more the bitter taste is cumbersome there is a balance between two worlds one with an arrow and a cross regardless of the balance life has becomecumbersome   What it is:   She's got a ticket but you need more than a ticket to get you there You need a string of good intentions and an easy burn Maybe some good luck with the cash tucked in the back of your pocket Maybe it's still not enough to ease your pain you get tired and say fuck it Each little mystery is safe in your heart you've got to wonder, is moving on the best that you can do? Need to have a little conversation Find the truth behind the questions that are haunting you She says there's motivationtucked into the crease between the seats I looked through the box for cigarettes, maps, keys There's so much room in hereyou can put your feet straight out the dash She turns the radio on pulls me close to hear me laugh Each little mystery is safe in your heart you've got to wonder, is moving on the best that you can do? Need to have a little conversation Find the truth behind the questions that are haunting you She rests her hand along the space between my neckline and my back I can feel her fingers runnin' through the feelingsI didn't think I had. Likemaybe this road we're on is the very thing that's come between us maybe it's the highway to the very place that might just save us Each little mystery is safe in your heart you've got to wonder, is moving on the best that you can do? Need to have a little conversation Find the truth behind the questions that are haunting you Each little mystery is safe in your heart you've got to wonder, is moving on the best that you can do? I hear you've got a little education It's not enough to satisfy what's haunting you

       What I fear:   Made to be Broken Some things are made to be broken Some things are made to be kept We’re in the space between what’s over and what’s left If I tried too hard to keep you I did it so I could reach youI had to re-arrange the only things that worked for me Part of this happened slowly and part of it overnight What happens when everything you want never arrives? Some things are made to be broken There’s a face in here from the past It’s and ocean under the glass I hang it up on the wall and never look back Little scar shaped souvenirs Are the only witnesses here To a faded alibi that used to be mine It used to be mine   Seven Mary Three lyrics

       I was watching ESPN this morning, a perk of living with two testosterone filled beings...and I saw the SF Giants uniform...I remember being about 12, and having a major "poser" disease, my cousin who was so cool because he got to use gel and wear real Polo shirts, had a poster of Will Clark that was about three feet by two feet, your standard poster. Every morning he would stretch, pretend to pull his baseball cap up and down, and pick up his hands like he was practicing his swing. He would look over his shoulder after each trial swing to see if he looked just like the poster. Little did he know that his dweeby cousin was looking over her shoulder to see if she looked anything like him. I bought a Will Clark poster, I don't even know who Will Clark is....I never used gel, but I did manage to score a Polo shirt.      Onto other topics, Parker, a social worker that is on my unit at the hospital bought all the kids dunkin' donuts today...every kind, chocolate (1), chocolate frosted (5), coconut (3), crullers (2), apple cinnamon (2), boston creme (2), and good ol' jelly filled (3)...she says before the herd gathers, grab your favorite....      I began to think out loud, ..."Chocolate is my favorite, but there's only one...there's five chocolate frosted, so maybe I should take one of those, noone would notice because there's four left over...but if I take the one chocolate, noone would fight over it, because noone would know it was even there, hey parker which is your favorite.." At this point she may as well have pulled up a couch and picked up a pen and pad to analyze my overanalytical behaviors....Without a word being spoken, I realized how I treat everything in life like this, instead of grabbing my chocolate doughnut, which I know I would enjoy, I am way too worried about being caught red handed making myself happy, without concern for the herd...the funny thing is it used to be something I would force myself to do, in order to please other people...now I think it's just conditioned behavior to overanalyze till I don't even remember what my favorite doughnut is anymore...and the fact that I'm writing about it too....a day later, yes....overanalytical...

       Weddings are beautiful, receptions are fun, but the toasts are the highlight for me...it's the perspectives of a couple, how they're seen in the eyes of those closest to them...or in some cases, those of us who really soak up the spotlight, me I prefer the lost candles and the speed walking ring boy action...my sentiments, I've mentioned just seem to come out of my mouth like an oversoaked spit ball...  Oh yeah, what i really wanted to write about..well, my choice in using simple scenarios fit for reality tv to decide if I think this is all a dream has proven successful...  first..i thought there's no way we could hang out without other people, for longer than a day, without getting bored, irritated, or smothered...the pilot for this show is so appropriately named..."Life after Elimi-date, When there's just ONE"+++++Ratings were ****, easily...not just four asterisks, but four stars....fabulous city things, we did from Broadway to the Yankees, to NYU bars and cute restaurants and shopping...station executives predicted a good first season...good ratings were in the future...I was still skeptical..because...after the fairy dust lands, how does the fairy tale end? After the flames would there only be ashes?      second...i thought even with the fabulous could he share his personal space, and more importantly, could we share our personal space (i.e. our city...Miami), could we potentially just fall back into old habits of him taking me for granted and me creating drama which would end things abruptly...the premiere episode also appropriately titled, "CSIO - Miami - Can't Slide Into Old Miami)...On it's debut, well, ratings remained in the ****1/2  realm....stellar reviews from critics, for romancing me in a city I thought I already knew...sushi, saki bombs, champagne, within the first ten minutes of this hour long show...the climax (haha) was reached during the scene on his pier, the resolution left the viewing audience waiting for more, but had the season started and ended with its premiere episode?  Had they already reached a plateau in the first week?  Now...      thirdly....remove active agent causing disinhibition (alcohol),  remove almost all outside contact, never go anywhere where entertainment or food exceeds 50 bucks (i.e. fairy dust), introduce the dreaded "my friend's wedding" into the intinerary, and I was almost fearful of the show being cut from the Fall lineup on CBS opposite Friends...This episode was called "The Simple   Life"...without Nicole Richey and Paris...or the pink pick up truck...it was replaced by a gray Dodge DURANGO...kid can you say, "HEMI?"....without the bikini clad buxom bleached blondes, the studio execs were fearful of the show's staying power, would old fans appreciate the characters maturing so quickly, and would new fans be able to appreciate the sobriety of the whole episode?  Ratings shot into the ***** 5 asterisk range, with over one million viewers.  The simple life gave me time to appreciate him as a whole person, never at a loss for words or laughs and finally tears, "What every good TV drama should milk from its audience...", raves  Rolling Stone  The sex scenes did not lack luster or passion since being moved from it's premium cable to basic cable status...critics wondered would sex in the city be just as HOT....not a worry ladies and gentlemen...the scenes have greater weight when you can replay them over and over again without empty blanks in memory due to alcohol, it's like you Tivo'ed this episode....there were no rifts or dissent sensed among the characters, everything just flowed smoothly, and the scenes where they just looked at each other, and talked about the next episode, trying to keep the audience guessing as to whether to expect a SEASON or SERIES finale...were amazing....altogether the best episode yet...I can't wait to see how this show holds up in the Fall lineup on CBS against "Friends."....With over one million viewers thus far this season...wonder if we could get some sponsors...some other investors who believe in the success of this show????
