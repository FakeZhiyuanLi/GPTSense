      I don't quite get the fascination, or obsession, that some people have about someone they really know very little about.  Upon encountering a celebrity, as I have a few times in my life, I always think, "Oh, I recognize that person from such-and such," and that's about it.  I don't feel compelled to introduce myself to them, comment about their work, or touch them.  They are people whose image just happens to be copied several times and distributed through different media.  They're just people.  They are not newly- discovered forms of life of extraterrestrial origin.  I'm not going to line up for several hours to get pictures taken with them, if I have any choice in the matter.  If only people showed as much respect and admiration for their own friends and family; maybe even their enemies, in some form or another, perhaps this world would be a better place.  Are you more excited to see a person whose image you've seen over and over again, whom you have never had a conversation with, than someone that you really know and love?

      Looking at some of my entries, you'd probably think I'm generally a miserable, negative person, full of malaise and ennui.  Sorry, felt like using some French.  Actually, I'm not.  It may be because I only write things on here when I'm bored or depressed.  Which makes sense, I guess.  Actually, when you average everything out over the last few weeks, I have probably been the happiest I've been since I was about 10 years old, believe it or not.  Well, maybe happiest is not the right word, exactly.  I should say most content with who I am, where I am.  Or, I should say, least unhappy, if that makes any sense.  Least anxious.  Least lonely.  Sometimes I feel lost, but it's nowhere near the feelings that I used to get.  I recover quickly; I realize that it's a mood that will pass.  I realize that bad moods are a part of life.  I think I've done okay for myself, overall.  A lot of what I have is much more than what most people on the planet will ever see.  And I do something that I love for a living.  And I'm self-sufficient, I'm healthy, I'm intact...  Am I whole?  Well, I don't know yet.  Is my life going to continue in a straight path and follow this pattern until the end?  Not sure.  And I guess I never really want to be completely sure.  Good moods are a part of life, too.  Really good, euphoric, what-the-fuck-is-happenning good moods.  And those make it all worth while.

      I need a freakin' vacation so badly now... Jesus.  And the fact that the weather around here has been totally freezing at night isn't really boosting my morale.  Do you ever get that completely bogged- down feeling when you think "Yeah, I can go on vacation, but the vacation can only last so long, and when I come back there will just be an even more tremendous pile of crap that I'll need to deal with."  God, I don't know what's going on, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know where my life is headed.  And I still have this annoying freakin' headache.  I just needed to complain.  Sometimes I don't know what the point of any of this is.

      Shit, why does my boss's ex always call up the office if he's never here, and she knows his cell phone number?  For fuck sake, leave me alone and don't bother me with that shit right now!

      I feel like I need to cash in some of my sick hours and take the rest of the day off of work.  What will I do with my extra time?  I was thinking about having a good cry.  I haven't cried in years.  I think I need a good one, the when-it-rains-it-pours, thunderstorm-in-the-desert, shuddering sob, snot-bubble, doubled-over-in-a-fetal-position kind.  If I'm not able to manage that perhaps I will take my dog to the beach.  There's nothing like the power of the Pacific Ocean to remind you of how inconsequential and insignificant your problems really are.  Ocean saltwater has exactly the same consistency as human tears.  I wonder if marine mammals cry, or if that problem is pretty much taken care of with the water.  I'm hoping no one reads this, but I'm writing it here anyway, I don't know why, I just had to dump these thoughts someplace else other than inside my own head.  It may be deleted just as fast as it was written.  It's purely an internal problem, no one can help me with it, I don't know why I would want anyone to read about it, it's no one's fault but my own, I guess I'm just an emotional exhibitionist or a fucking sedomasochist.

      I've been having too many good things happen to me lately.  This is definitely not fitting into my normal pattern of bad luck.  Today I got another random raise at work.  And I've sort of been procrastinating lately.  Imagine if I were operating at 100%?  I feel like I'm due for a disaster pretty soon.  This much good luck with no effort on my part has to be bad for my karma.  Maybe my splice has occurred after all...

      When I was little I was very religious.  Probably up through freshman or sophomore year of high school, in fact.  I used to say a set number of Hail Marys and Our Fathers per day, plus a bunch of other ones my parents and grandmother taught me.  Somewhere along the line I got really pissed at Jesus.  There were times that I thought he had ditched me or was purposely being a jerk to me.  instead of prayers, there were actually times when I would literally look up at the sky and say, "Dude, why are you being such a dick?  Remember a few years ago, when I was your best friend?  Let's see if I ever talk to you again."  Well, whether or not he could actually hear me, whoever he worked for or whoever's son he supposedly was, I think that's incidental.  What I was saying goodbye to was an ideal- the paradigm of a human being.  I was saying goodbye to my own naivete.  Having learned more about the world, I stopped believing that anyone actually gave a fuck about living up to such an example.  I started to think, what's the point in trying to follow the example of a historical figure from 2000 years ago, if it only means that people in the late 2nd/ early 3rd millenia would just walk all over you for it?  What kind of reward do you get for "following Jesus?"  Let's be practical for a second and think about it strictly from a scientific standpoint.  Well, lately I've been realizing that perhaps I've already been given my reward, and am continuing to reap rewards, without even noticing.  Maybe there's reward enough in contributing to the survival of your species.  Maybe there is such thing as good Karma, and maybe Jesus isn't such a dick after all.  The jury's still out on his dad, though.  Can you really call the underlying infinitely complex mathematical order of the universe a dick?  And would it care if you did?

      What if you could choose the exact traits that the perfect member of the opposite sex (or the same sex, if that's your thing) would have.  What would they be?  Let's say that you can choose 50 traits that he or she would have, in terms of personality, intelligence, and interests.  Let's say you can choose, oh, 10 physical traits.  What would it be worth to you to be able to meet a person with all those traits- down to the very last one- tomorrow?  Can a price even be put on that?  Is it worth different things to different people?  Maybe to some it's not worth much at all, and of course to others the question isn't even applicable.  What are the chances that a person like that even exists?  Now, the big question is, what are you supposed to say to him or her when you finally meet?  Let's say he or she doesn't know about all the traits that you have chosen.  How are you supposed to explain them to him or her without it sounding like a load of bullshit?  Now, what if he or she decides to convince you that he or she does not possess all of those traits?  What argument can you make?  A pretty tough puzzle... perhaps requiring lateral thinking...

      Mondays.  For obvious reasons.  Although my current job does make it easier for me to deal with them.  On this particular Monday, as with many Mondays recently, I am finding it hard to concentrate and hence I find ways to procrastinate.  No, I am not charging clients for this, of course.  Oh, the other thing I'm not comfortable with.  Crushes.  They're like hiccups.  I thought I was all done with them as of a decade or so ago.  I've never had hiccups in ten years, and I was hoping that I would never have another one, nor would I ever have another crush.  The similarities between the two?  Lack of control.  Will power has nothing to do with it; they are involuntary bodily functions.  And you always feel stupid during and after they are happening, especially if they're loud and obvious.  I shouldn't be having any crushes, doing any crushing, at this age.  Is that what this is?  It's different than before.  I thought crushes, by definition, were contingent upon physical attraction, but I guess I was wrong, because apparently I have a crush on a woman without even knowing what she really looks like.  Uh oh, you're thinking, this guy has lost it.  And that's my whole point.  Remember that movie "You've Got Mail?"  Cheesy and sappy come to mind.  How do I get myself into such situations...

      First time blogging.  Initial entries will probably be cursory at best, until I figure out how to be witty and somewhat entertaining to those who don't know me while simultaneously being benign and, um, careful, to those who do know me and have somehow found this blog.  I must have told you about it while drunk.  Either that or I must really like you.

      My concept of time is warped right now.  It feels like weeks since I've written on here but I just wrote something four days ago.  Maybe it's because so much has happened between then and now.  Driving hundreds of miles for my sister's graduation, partying, eating, and drinking to excess down there, and a busy day at work yesterday and even today, though it is supposed to be my first day of vacation.  I just felt bad that I had one piddly little thing to do before receipt of permit for this one project, and the clients have been waiting so patiently.  Little did I know that driving to do that one piddly little thing and waiting a few hours in total for red tape to untangle itself would take basically the whole day.  So I guess I have an extra day of vacation somewhere down the road.  Although I have so many freakin' days piled up I can't keep track of them anymore.  But that also means that I'm almost a day behind moving all my crap from my old apartment to my recently acquired house.  Oh well.  I guess I'll just enlist a few more people to help me.  After all, I did get all those offers.  I'm going to shoot for being out of here by noon on Friday.  Then I'll have a bunch of days left of vacation to enjoy the house and hang shelves and pictures on the walls.  It could be that my concept of time is warped due to sudden exposure to the sun for prolonged periods of time after living like a vampire for several months.  I think it made me loopy.  Oh well, at least I have a nice, dark tan now.  Wow, this is pretty much the most normal and sane thing I've ever written on here.  That must mean I'm happy.  Could it be the sun?  Could it be the length of days?  Could it be my house?  Could it be my ridiculously- friendly-to-the-point-of-being-Midwestern new neighbors?  Could it be my vacation?  Could it be that work is going pretty well?  Or is it something else?  Hmmm...

      How did people communicate across oceans before there was copper wire and fiber optic cable?  How did people find long- lost friends without the internet?  It must have been agonizingly slow.  Waiting for a letter from overseas, complete with wax signet seal, must have been excruciating.  Do you remember life without the internet?  Granted, it was invented in the sixties, and I wasn't alive back then, but it didn't come into widespread use until, what, the late eighties?  I know I never used e-mail until I got to college.  Who would have thought that almost nine years later I would have become so dependent on it?  Remember having to find a particular item, for a history or science project in junior high, and actually needing to use the yellow pages to call businesses one at a time, or, worse yet, go door to door?  You know, many may say that the internet is a source of evil and corruption.  But it sure as hell makes it easier to find the things you're looking for, regardless of how unlikely the the chances of finding them seem.  Millenia from now people will be wondering how 21st century dwellers dealt with the tediousness of communicating between planets with simple beams of electromagnetic radiation.  Imagine, waiting over a twenty- minute delay when talking to your friend on Mars.  How long would a phone conversation be?  I wonder, if two telepathic people were placed light years apart from each other, would their communication be instantaneous or limited by the speed of light?  If the speed of light is 310,000 km per second, what is the speed of thought?

      I'm not entirely sure anyone is reading this blog at all, so maybe I'm just talking to myself.  That's okay, I do that a lot, and my fingers can use the exercise as opposed to my vocal chords.  I wonder how long blogs last, or how long they theoretically can last.  I mean, technically there's no reason why a blog shouldn't last until the end of time.  Someone on a distant planet several thousand years from now might find this in the archives of the internet somewhere.  They may delete it.  Or they may read it and dismiss it.  What's the point of writing it, then?  Well, if   one is going to pose that question, one must also ask what the point of living life is.  I really don't know what I'm talking about.  I am rambling as usual.  That's the whole point of this.  It's nice and hot today.  Finally.  Solstice approaches.  Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog.

      Someone to go to my stupid movies with so I don't feel awkward sitting by myself in the theater (I have only done that once or twice in my life- as misanthropic as I may be, I just cannot sit in a movie theater by myself).  Someone to do things with that no one else really wants to do, like walk to the top of Half Dome.  Someone to go to my favorite steakhouses that don't offer takeout with, so, once again, I do not feel stupid sitting by myself.  Someone to fly to a distant and new place with me so I don't have to start up conversations with strangers on an agonizingly long flight.  Someone to sit on the train with me in Europe so that we can sleep in shifts and gypsies won't steal our stuff.  Someone to accept chocolates and roses from me on Valentine's Day so that they won't go to waste after I buy them in an effort to feel like part of the crowd.  Someone to put sunscreen on my back.  Someone to massage my back when I'm so tense that it spasms really hard and makes me feel like I'm growing a second goddamn spine.  Someone to give my friends a reason for why I always put the toilet seat down.  Someone to use as an excuse when I just don't feel like hanging out with said friends.  Someone to go to a beach on a Hawaiian Island with so I don't feel like the only lone freakin' creature on the planet and I can just enjoy the sunset.  (Even the damn fish I see while snorkeling are in pairs.)  Someone to bug me to clean up and be more organized.  Someone to take up the extra space in my house.  Someone to help me use up all those stupid two-for-one coupons.  Someone to go to my high school reunion with so I don't have to pretend to get along with all the shallow people.  Someone whose picture I can put in my wallet so it looks like I have a life.  Someone to be with on New Year's Eve.  Someone to listen to me bitch and moan.  Someone to bitch and moan to me.  Someone to call me up at work to give me reason to procrastinate.  Someone to paint a portrait of.  Someone to split the bloomin' onion at Outback with because it's way too big to finish by myself but I love that sauce that comes with it.  Someone to suck the venom out when I go to the actual Outback and get bitten by a snake.  Someone to read ramblings such as this.  Someone to give my mom assurance that I'm not gay.  Someone to make everyone stop asking why I'm single.  Someone to cook breakfast for.  Someone to wake me up when I don't hear any of the three alarm clocks.  Someone to sit next to me on a roller coaster.  Someone to be around on Friday and Saturday nights when no one else seems to be.  Someone to ride in the car with me between 6 AM to 9 AM and 3 PM to 6 PM on weekdays so I can use the carpool lane.  And cross the Bay Bridge without paying toll.  Someone to get sloppy drunk with.  Yeah, someone to drink an Irish Car Bomb with.  Someone to split those 3,000 calorie restaurant desserts with so that I don't get fat nearly as fast.  Someone to whisper to me until I fall asleep.  Someone to pretend to like me.

       Aha, seems that we are now able to alter the font, size and color of our entries, and   the html!?  Wow, now I can put links on my entries like a real grownup.  Of course if I weren't so apathetic I'm sure I would have found a way to do that in any case.          This shed I am building is getting to be a pain.  It was just supposed to be a simple little shed.  But no.  I had to go and make it complicated.  Seems like I complicate a lot of things in life that should be straighforward and simple.  I like making things hard on myself.  I didn't know it was going to take several trips in a little car and two trips in a giant SUV to get the materials necessary to build this so-called little shed.  or make that three trips in the SUV, because I have to go back and get more stuff tomorrow.  Maybe it wasn't such a smart idea to move almost a ton of material by myself.  Is that why I'm sore?  I'm a pain in my ass.    And now here's what I just wrote in Webdings:      Aha, seems that we are now able to alter the font, size and color of our entries, and   the html!?

      I feel like my mind is on too many things at once, even though comparitively I've been a complete slacker lately.  Actually, it might be that a good portion of my brain is preoccupied, and the little part that's remaining is overwhelmed by simple tasks such as home improvement, feeding animals, and writing in my blog.  procrastination awkward silence dominates anticipation  midnight reflection across the largest ocean my dreams shall set sail  through my mind's valley an intangible fog creeps soothing and calming  a beautiful voice is heard across the darkness the dawn approaches  dazzling daylight dark corners of my heart thaw the long winter ends  my fears put to rest relief and joy fill my lungs this must be a dream  whispers in my ear will tell me to awaken this can't be real
