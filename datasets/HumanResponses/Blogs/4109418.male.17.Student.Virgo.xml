      I went fishing down at Long Branch (off the usual jetty, on my usual rock). I caught a flounder and a skate. Ben caught a flounder. (It was too small so he threw it back) Dave caught a skate. Joe caught a flounder. Min caught a skate and  a seagull . When I snagged my skate, he came over with the net to scoop it up. While he was down by the water pulling on the line, Ben yelled, "Hey, Min! Your pole!" And lo and behold, there was a seagull eating the bait off his hook.  This was my last day with Min, at least till Thanksgiving break. I knew people were leaving for college, but it never seemed that real to me till I realized Min was leaving Friday. People have already left. Min's leaving. Hell,  I'm  leaving. This is just like graduation. You wait and wait for it, and it just seems further and further away. But when it finally arrives, it doesn't feel real. You think you'll just be back in high school after the summer, back practicing three times a day in the summer for football, seeing the same people day after day. But in fact, it really is over. And when move-in day seemed like some far off date, it's quickly approaching. Man...

      Watching Michael Phelps swim has inspired me. Inspired me to do what, I don't know, but inspired me nonetheless. I guess it's the fact that he's 19 years old and the "greatest all-around swimmer in the world" and has record-breaking ambitions, setting and shattering his own world records, and aiming for the improbable (well, now it's impossible) eight gold medals to surpass Spitz's seven at the Munich games. He's only two years old than me, and look and all he's done and is still doing. If that's not an inspiration, I don't know what is.  He's inspired me to get back in shape. I want to run a mile under six minutes again, something I haven't been able to do since I was a sophomore. I want to run a quarter of marathon under an hour again, again something I haven't been able to do since sophomore year. I want to clean-and-jerk 225lb. (185lb. during football). I want to bench 405lb. (315lb. is no longer a goal, but a benchmark. Literally.) I want to do a lot of things, and the first step is to quit smoking. I went an entire day without a cigarette yesterday, and I have yet to smoke today. I smoked my last cigarette Saturday night, cleaned out my ashtray and put away my lighters. Though quitting smoking is a good first step towards getting fit again, I haven't been able to stop eating. Maybe I'm eating normally and I'm just being paranoid. But in any case, getting fat would be counterproductive towards my goal. I guess the whole quitting smoking and gaining weight sort of balance each other out.  I'm going to run three times a week, swim twice a week, and lift five times a week. Since New Year's is still a bit off, this is my New School Year Resolution. Let's see how long I can stick to it. Or if I even begin with.  Watching women's gymanstics is just depressing. These girls are younger than I am, and they're already world champions. Michael Phelps is inspiring. These girls are depressing. Go figure. But for the first time ever Morgan and I agree on something: Courtney Kupets and Carly Patterson are the best.

      If you pass the groundhog on Fifth Ave., please, observe a moment of silence. I'm sorry, little groundhog. It was either you or the Acura, and in State Farm's eyes, you aren't much. Weren't much.

      I finally went back to work today after a month off. (I was away from June 29-July 17, and when I came back I found out Doc had gone on vacation without telling me. And when he got back he apparently never got the message I left him on the answering machine in the office asking him to call me back to let me know when I should be come in for work. So he'd been working a week thinking I was still on vacation till I called him Saturday.) He'd brought in someone from another office to help him while I was on my supposed vacation. I knew where everything was in the office. I had a system. And she'd gone and fucked that all up, rearranging cabinets and drawers, and moving things from one room to another. So I spent a good half-hour figuring out where everything was, from the cotton rolls to the topical anesthetic. She'd gone and moved the syringes from the drawer in the back with the rest of the instruments into the patient rooms. To anyone else, it'd seem stupid to care, but trust me on this: when you're a dental assistant, knowing where everything is  is  a big deal. That bitch.  Juliana's disappeared. She apparently came into work Wednesday, told Doc, "See you Saturday," as she was leaving, then never came into work Saturday. She ran away to Canada according to her cousin. So you know what that means: I get her Saturday shift. More hours mean more money, but they also mean more responsibility. I've got to do the things Juliana used to do, like clean out the microfilm developer. I guess it's a little selfish of me, even a little cruel, to be more concerned with getting her hours than her well-being, but c'mon: she's in Canada. What young Columbian girl wouldn't be having fun in the Great White North? Canada's just like Columbia, only colder, with a rampant cannabic culture minus the drug cartels. See, it's just like home. If this were some reality game show, I'd be the winner: the last assistant. I win. I hope she wasn't kidnapped or anything.  Everyone's already gone shopping for college, and what've I been up to? Trying to kill off this chest infection with regular fumigations of tobacco smoke. I don't know how many times Andi's been to Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, but she apparently went crazy with the registry gun. (They're not just for weddings anymore.) I should probably go and at least look around sometime soon. But I can at least do this, make a new blog, a college-ready one. I got tired of the old one anyway. Reminded me too much of high school. Goodbye,  urlLink koreateen .
