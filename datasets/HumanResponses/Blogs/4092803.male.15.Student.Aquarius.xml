      That's right, I'm writing about fishing.  Now, why fishing?  When I was about 7, my mom and her friend would make me go fishing, like, every weekend with them, and, my god, was it boring, I never caught a fish either usually when I went, I've actually caught one or two while fishing, but, they're not as abundant as the media shows.  Imagine, sitting on the shore of a lake (few people usually actually take boats out in the water, unless they're 60 year old men, they all cast from the shore) for about.. 3 whole hours, waiting to catch a fish..  What the fuck is up with that?  I mean, it would just be easier to hike your ass down to the bloody supermarket, which, may I add, is bout 30 minutes closer, and, doesn't smell of chum, and, grab some fish from the freezer aisle.  "But, those fish aren't  fresh. "  Well, I don't know about everyone else, but, witht he 2or 3 small fish we caught, usually, when we got home, my mom's friend skinned and gutted them, cutting himself since he's drunk, cussed in frustration, and, ended up shoving them in the freezer and sending me on my bike to get some Wendys.  Earlier toda,y I decided to dig in my freezer, find the fish, and, check the dates that were put on the package with a magic marker.  Now, I found one fish, that I could grab without being smushed by tons of other frozen indescrenable meats.  Now, what did it say?  "Bluegill, July,  1996 "  I have an eight year old frozen fish in my freezer.. And.. now, that's fresh!  Seriously, get fish from the supermarket.  Now.. actually fishing.. it's nothing than sitting on some hard uncomfortable rocks, or, in some itchy bug filled grass, with a fishing pole out in the water, staring a small red orb, waiting for it to move, so, you know you have a damn fish.  Where the bloody hell is the fun in that?  Now, I've developed my own theory, for, why people like going fishing.      The three reasons people want to go fishing:   1)To get piss drunk 2)Because they're too poor to buy food, becuase, they spend all their money on getting piss drunk. 3)It's actually and excuse for guys to get out of the house and have homoerotic orgies without their wives knowing, all while they're piss drunk.      So, yeah.  So, basically don't go fishing unless you want to get alot of bug bites, be bored out of your bloody mind, and, be assraped by your buddy Jim.  Trust me, he didn't bring that lube to make the hook go easier into the fishe's mouth  But, something else is prolly gonna end up in somebody elses mouth  Jesus, I've made at least three references to anal sex of some sort since my blog started, just only yesterday.  Damn I'm good   -Teh Bret O_o;  America's anal reference superstore

      These are words that are commonly used, that, I decided to put down, because, well, I find them to be fucking annoying.  Now, it's not just words, it's also sounds and such or.. psuedo-words that are used commonly online.  Note : These words are in no particular order, I jsut numbered them to make is easier to follow.   Now, here's the list:     1)"Whatever"  Now, I don't know why this irritates me, it just bloody well does. When people say it, they're completely ignoring you, and, I believe that it would be like a shortened form of.. "Whatever you're saying, I'm ignoring it because I'm being a ho bag."  That's right, a ho bag, which, by common misconception, is not a bag of ho's, but, a bag of items used by ho's in their profession.  Now, back to the word. When people do say it, they give off an sorta feeling of superiority, a, I'm better than you so I don't have to listen, or, a feeling that you're annoying them, and, rather than just ASKING them to leave you alone, which, usually works except for those rather annoying ho bags, you give them a "Whatever" usually accompanied by an eye roll or a similar action.   In short. If you say whatever alot, every now and then is okay, but, if you say it alot, and, don't tell the people to leave you alone instead of doing the eye rolling torture. You need to be beaten with a sack of potatoes.   2) "Meh"   That's right, meh, it's a expression of disdain or I don't care-ness. It annoys me, because, everyone bloody says it, it's even more annoying when people say it to every single fucking thing you say. i mean.. if you want to bother me with ignorance, you might as well come up with somethign other than meh. Toss in the occasion 'that's nice' or, 'oh, really' or even an 'interesting' here and there.  Stop using Meh. It's just stupid, and, you don't sound very smart using it. Ho bags.   3) "Heh"  I hate it when people use 'heh' every other sentence, I mean, it's just an irritating little thing. It has a sound of disdain, a pompous feel to it, plus, god dammit, nto everything is so amusing you have to put heh every other sentence.  Once again, sack of potatoes, moving on.   4) "Cheese"  I've got nothing against cheese itself, but, everyone's using it, acting like its weird to use it alot, it's not, it's just uninteresting, forget about the dairy product, move on, it doesn't make you cool in a weird way.  We should stop using the sack of potatoes now, they're prolly getting squished and drippy, and, I don't want potato juice on my floor.  We'll instead use a random senator.  Next!   5) "Ain't"  Come on you slack jawed idiots, it isn't that hard to just say.. well.. Isn't. Ain't is not a real word, it's slang, it's in the dictionary, AS SLANG. So, stop using the excuse it's not in the dictionary other people. Because, it is, but, it's slang, it's improper, feel free to use it, but, hey, just use Isn't every now and again, it's nicer than ain't, and, makes you sound less like a man named Jim with a rifle.  The more a person says ain't, the more I expect them to hunt down a fat man, and, make him squuuueeeeaaaaal like a pig.  And, with the people that say ain't that I know, the fat man's probably the more attractive one too.  Once again, use that senator, we can prolly give him a concussion and kill two idiots with one stone.     Aaand, you know what, that's all I can think of at the moment.  I'm sorry if I've offended any users of the above words, I'm just bored, and, gah, too many people say them, and, it gets on my nerves.   -Teh Bret O_o;  Wishing that he actually had a sack of potatoes

      Well, I have a blog now! It really feels alot more. well.. individual than the old Greatestjournal I had, and, besides, alot of my posts would probably fit better in a blog.  But yeah, this is complete well.. shinyness. I mean, the banner at the top is sorta.. annoying *poke poke*  But, hey, I'll get used to it. And, I'll try to update this sucker as much as heavenly possible, trust me, I'm easily bored, and, when you bore me, and, add google, well.. you get me hunting down Invader Zim yaoi jsut to see if it exists, not a pretty sight.  But, yeah, it's nice to be on blogger, It'll take me a bit to get used to navigating it, but, hey, I pick up on things quickly, I should be zoomin about in no time.   -Teh Bret  Wishing that silly little gothic girls would stop having Zim anal probe Dib.

      You know what, the d20 system needs to be applied to real life.   Dice with several sides solve everything.    "John.. I have herpes, and.. I think I gave it to you"  ... SAVE AGAINST DISEASE WITH A  2 PENICILLIN BONUS!      "Bob, I just remembered I forgot to take my birth control!"  .. REFLEX THROW With *uugh*  -3 to save!      "Bob, I think I'm pregnant."  .. ROLL D20 TO HIT WITH LEAD PIPE! Wilderness check to conceal body!      Sorry folks, you prolly wwon't get any of this if yu don't play Dungeons and Dragons or some other d20 game like Modern XD but, hey, it sure as hell was fun for me!         LESSON TIME!:   Oh, and, so you know, there's I believe 6 official die used in d20   d4 - A traingular pyramid      d6 - A cube      d8 - An polyhedron with 8 sides      d10 - A polyhedron with 10 sides      d12 - A polyhedron with 12 sides      d20 - a polyhedron with 20 sides     d20 is mostly used for saving throws and and to hit, the others are usually used for damage and spell duration time, things like that.        W00t, because, I have not said that in bloody fucking forever    - Teh Bret O_o;  Always willing to spew useless information
