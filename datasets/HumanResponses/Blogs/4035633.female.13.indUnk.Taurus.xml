      Don't pay attention to the title. It has nothing to do with what I'm about to write. But all to do with everything else. Well anyway... Moving on to more important stuff.  Last night M-li slept over. We were having the time of our lives. First, when she came, I showed her the new dances I learned! *Do the spiritual stretch!* Haha. Then we went swimming. We stayed in the pool for a while luaghing about really random stuff. We talked about... girl stuff... surprisingly. Mostly clothes and junk. Then we went back inside. We go online for a little bit... And then start watching a movie. It was probably one of the worst movies ever, so we shut it off after like 40 minutes. Then we went swimming again for a very short time. M-li was like "its too late to be in the pool". So we got out again. Then we went on the roof to look at the moon. It was so beautiful. And the clouds were moving really fast, so it looked like... Yeah, you get the picture. We called some people. We wanted to see who was up at one thirtyish. We stayed on the phone w/ Jojo for a while talking about the moon and junk. Then we hung out on the roof. I wanted to go streaking but noooooo M-li didn't want to. Well anyway, it was sooo nice outside. Breeze, weather, temp, dark... Twas all good in my hood. Then we came bak inside... Watched about half an hour more of the horriblest movie ever, and decided we could pull an all nighter some other night. So we went to bed. Oh joy!  Ummm now I'm waiting for Chloe Alex and maybe Rachel to get here... The end!                                                         Boa    :-  *

      Me and Emily just spent an hour and a half on the phone. I realized that it's not just me feeling everything. I'm not crazy. But thats the most devastating part... I'm not crazy. I... or we are drifting apart. Something isn't right. We felt the same exact.... wrongness... when we were together with everyone. We always have. Me and Emily always feel the same thing. We get in trouble for the same things too. I can't help but realizing how lucky I am to have her in times like these. She's the only one who understands me best. Yes, Jojo does too (ur the best too)... But like I always say... On a different level. The rest of you people think I'm crazy. But if I am crazy, at least we're loosing it together. Best buddies our very last breaths. *Lets commit suicide together in that case! =P  So I would just like to say thanks to Emily and Jojo for listening to me. And Now I'm REALLY gonna go to sleep... I hope.

      It seems to be getting worse by the hour. I drift more and more apart from the people I used to be so close with... I become quiter and less opinionated. And for what? Yeah, you  all  know what I'm getting at. Why am I changing so much over this? I feel like a puppet on strings.   I keep trying to talk to people about my feelings... But I think no one takes me seriously. Like when I was talking to Alexis today I was like "I feel like I'm not as close with everyone anymore". I really don't think she took me seriously. I  really  feel this way. I feel like I'm falling apart. I called so many people today. Only one person called for me, being Alexis. The phone used to be so busy with people for me. Now people barely call. I kept telling Emily she was my best friend ever today. I feel like I have to keep reassuring her, or she'll replace me. I feel like she feels like I replaced her. I didn't. I didn't replace anyone with anyone. But I think people have been replacing me. Who knows? Maybe its just my irrationalness.   I don't think things will ever be the same with anyone. I'm too far gone. And I don't know how or why. I keep trying to make attempts to become myself again, but it never does me any good. It just gets people angry. I guess I'll just give it up and not care anymore. Oh well.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boa

      Past few days have been the same sameness. Spoiling- strangely enough- continues (dad made mom get cable back, and the "no more animals are coming in this house ever again" thing seems to have been cancelled). I love babies... Me and Kim are chillin. Joeys over... Natalies annoying... All the same stuff. So lets get more into the details of the sameness of today.  I wake up... Peter comes over around 8:45... We go to VBS. Franchesca comes straight to me and afterwards, Angeline. Britt took Franchesca =(, and I took Angeline to the nursery. We played for a while... I made a picture frame! =P ... Then we went back to get Franchesca.  We drive Peter home, and Joey comes over... We watched some music videos and colored fairy pictures. Yay! More fairies! Mom, britt, Nat, and Joey went shopping. They came home with a&nbsp;goldfish for me! I named it Emily! (ok, can I suck up any more to you?). And then Kim tryed to get me in the pool... Didn't work. Ok and then I'm here. The end

      My daddy spoils me wayyyyy too much. He spent 20 dollars on a replacement cable for my xbox to hook it up to the tv. Hes the bestest. And he got me new Chucks. All in one day.  Ok, well I've decided I NEEEEED a baby. I've been watching them this week for the moms that are working... And they just love me! Yay! And ya no, with me being a girl and all I have natural mothering instincts. Oh yes!  I just died Brookes hair. We're waiting to wash it out. I can't wait. I did it all by myself. So I'ma go adios.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxBoaxx

      I'm sick of everyone trying to control me. If you don't like what I'm doing, deal with it. Other people manage to. I'm me. I'm not changing.  And how come you all can be urselves and I have to accept it? And then you all won't accept me? Pft...

      Even though I was a little stressed out cuase Grandma Aksnes went into surgery today, I had the one of the best days ever. This whole week has just been amazing. I woke up late, and then I went to C-dOgs house. If I didn't know better, I woulda thought I was on drugs. I was sooo hyper and happy and luaghing. After eating "lunch" (haha triscuits), we went riding around. Umm... Everywhere we went, no one was home. So we went to visit my Jo-ji-poo at 7 11. I wound up working for him =P.I mopped the floor! And the dude wanted to give me a job, but I'm too young. Haha yay for me! I was having such a great time the entire time. Riding back to C-dOgs house, we took a detour to Spencers house. We visited her, got water (lol), and basically left. Haha. Then while riding back, C-dOg (who was riding MYYYY 200$ really really really good bike.. that I bough all by myself. haha) basically flipped offa my bike. It was actually pretty funny. She was ok though. Ok... so moving on, I started riding back to her house and "Boa, come here". "Catch up to me biznatch, then I'll hold all ur stuff for you". "No, really! Come here!". "You didn't break my chain did you?". Yeah, I guessed it, my chain fell offa the circlely thing. So me- handy dandy Boa- fixed it. My hands got all full of grease and stuff, but it was all good. I'm so multi-purpose. I mop, and fix bikes! Ok, so after that, I got back to Chloes house, and I called my mom. She made me come home. And so on.  Well anyway, to make today even better... (not to be concieted or anything) I looked amazing today. I mean... same face :/ same body :/ but it was all good. My hair was curly allllll the way up to the top and I was in overalls (I swear, I looked how I looked when I was like 2... ribbon curls and children clothes.). All I needed was workboots, and I coulda completed the outfit. But I was in my converses, which kinda made it more cooler. Haha. Even tho c-dOg had to ruin my fun and tell me on the phone she wasn't gonna let me go out (as in around... you sik perverted minded people!) with her in overalls, I looked soooo cool. Haha.  Ok, so I had one of the best times ever today. This week just keeps getting better! Wooo! Yay! Ok... the end               Boa

      Well.... It all started when Chloe woke me up, cuasing me to fall offa the bed. Ok, then we got dressed, blah blah... We got my bike to go to Chloes house. I ran next to Chloe the whole way to her house while she was on my bike.  Ok, then we got her bike... Drove around for a while... Visited some of our home bodies and such. Then Kelley and Spencer called. We rode over to CVS to meet them and went back to Kelleys house. Umm after me and Spencer rode to the pharmacy, we went back to Kelleys house! Oh joy! We watches music videos for a while, and went around. Umm... We went to Spencers house to get her messed up bike, which I wound up riding... We went to waterfront park. After swinging for a while, and going on the spinny thing we decided to go in the water. Hey? What could a harmless dip do? Yeah, well it almost drowned us! Yay! After me Spencer and Kelley went under, Chloe (aKa Clutzilla haha) cut her knee on a rock. Me Spencer and Kelley were like "lets go to the island!"... So we did. After we were on the other side, we waited for a few boats to pass (hahaha) and we started swimming back. The current got mad strong, and we all thought we were about to die. Spencer- "Kel, I'm not going anywhere!", Kelley- "I'm tired", Boa-::breathing mad heavy::. After Kelley and Spencer got to poles, like 12 feet away from where We were aiming I was like "I'm gonna die! AHHH!". Little did I know, I could stand! So they told me I could stand, and I go NO I CANT!!! And then I stand and go "oh". So we almost drowned and got sucked into sea. Fun fun fun. Yay! Then my mom called and ruined all the fun. So Now I'm home and still wet. So... I'ma shower. The end!  Boa

      I've been so down lately. But all of a sudden its gotten sooo much better (see header). I really have been getting closer with everyone. And, yes, I am changing alot. But trying to fight it, is just keeping me from becoming the new and improved version of myself. I still have somewhat of who I used to be underneath it all. I just have to learn to accept all the change and work with it for the better. So it's all good in my hood.  Well anyway, yesterday... Chloe came over, then Nicole, Rossy, and Lexiboo. Lexiboo is my energy. I love her soooo much. Nicole wanted to go swimming, but she didn't have a bathing suit... So she was like lets just go in in our clothing. Now, all of you who know me know I would ussually just do so (haha Kim)... But I kinda really liked what I was wearing. So lil miss Boa stripped down to her undies... and sox and hopped right into the pool before anyone else. It was really fun. Then my mom came and was like ooooookkkk... After that... We did some other stuff... Nothing particular sticks out besides fruit loops, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream (it rained fruit loops! haha lexiboo). Ummm... Then we went to the mall with me C-dOg, Nicole, Jojo, Alexa, Brian ;) (lol), and Franco. Jojo got me and Chloe build-a-bears! Yay!!! Chloe named hers Boa and I named mine Chloe. Then I got in trouble for chasing Franco around the music store with some pipe thing cuase he hit me in the butt with it so I wanted to hit him right back. Umm... We were going through Macys trying to find Jojos parents, and we passed through the langerie section. I chased Brian around with a few bras and some thongs. Then Franco was like "I'll try on a bra", but he backed out right before I could get it on him. He's such a looser. It's all good though. Ok, yes good times at the mall.  Umm....  Yeah, today I was dragged to the beach with church. I hid wrapped up in a sheet for about 10 minutes, then I hung out for a little while. It was pretty cold. I got burnt (go figger). Then I went to C-dOgs house, and we straightened my hair. Then.... I WENT BACK TO CHURCH! PT told me that I should get japanese straightening did on my head. So did britt... Joey was like "Your not allowed outta the house". Why? Well of course, it's great hair weather- but it's bad boy weather. Joey, ur such a looser. Ok, then umm... Yeah, thats about it. The end.      BOA!!!!

      I've been grounded from the computer for the past few days... So what have I been up to?  On Monday, Chloe, Spencer, and Lexiboo came over. We played and had fun fun fun.  On Tuesday, I stayed home until about 6:30ish playing Soul Callibur (?) 2 with Luke. I don't get whats with all the rage with that game. Kinda annoying after a while. Well anyway. Then I went to Nicoles house and hung out with her and Patrick. I decided that I haven't been myself lately, so I resorted to running into trees with my pants pulled down, and my shirt on my head like a turban (don't worry, I had shorts on under my pants, and i was wearing a tank top under my shirt). Ok... Yeah. Thats about it. I got in trouble for walking home by myself. But I wasn't walking. I was scootering. =P  Yesterday- Chloe came over. We had fun. Later on that night, she told someone I liked him =D. We'll see how that one turns out. Now onto the good part. It was about 1ish, and I was just oh so an-ger-y. So I decided to take out my wonderful diary (yes, I have one... and YES! I'm proud!) and I wrote a  6 page hate letter . I'm not gonna tell you all who it was to, cuase its that painfully obvious. Ok.  This morning. I woke up to my cell phone going off. Thankyou Chloe and Lexiboo. So I decided 9:57 was late enough to sleep this morning. I woke up, played random games on my x-box... And showed britt (see, i got the lowercases) how to put pics on her xanga. The end.  x3 x3 Boa  P.s.- My phone is broked and I have no minutes left on the cell. So umm... Dont call lol. I'll call you if your special enough.

      I can only imagine how heart wrenching it is to know the one person you have loved for so long will  never  love you back. I've had a small, bitter taste of it. But nothing like the situation at hand....  I wish I could make you happy, but I can't. I'm sorry.  Love Always,             Brooke-Noel

      Everyone has been getting mad tight over the summer. But I feel I stand stagnant with all of my friendships. I feel- once again- like I'm loosing everyone. Well... Not like I'm loosing them, but I feel threatened once again.  I'll call you.
