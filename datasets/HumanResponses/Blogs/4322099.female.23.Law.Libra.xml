       My boyfriend is acting werid, my parents won't let me call him.. They think that I am crazy for dating someone shorter and younger than I am. But, he is only a few months behind me. I don't understand why they do this. I don't understand why they hate him, they haven't met him at all. No one in my family has. They tell me not to judge a book by it's cover, but isn't what they are doing here? I know that I am not the only one to feel this way. Many girls my age do. But, my boyfriend and I are really in love you see.. And, no one can stop that. No one. Not you.. Not my parents. No one but me can break our relationship.. No one at all..                 ~P6EvilSquirell~

         Hi. Again.     My name is Millers Rule The Court. As you can see, I love the millers. A lot. But, that isn't why I am writing to Blog Spot for the second time today. It is because Of a little problem I have with my Boyfriend and my parents. They want me to dump him because of the Phone Bill, but it isn't my fault he lives in Anderson, and it isn't his either. I could really use   someones   help about know. Please give me some advice.  ~MillersRuletheCourt~

       Hi ya'll. My name is MILLERS RULE THE COURT. Duh.  But, anyway. If ya'll hate Harry Potter, you seriously need to IM me (Instant Message) or E-mail me. We have tons to talk about. But, all I want to say is, ya'll who spend all day and all night on the computer, need to play some B-Ball Basketball. It is good for you, and is very healthy. Basketball is so much fun. And, I should know. I play basketball in five different leagues... And, I am a varsity player for my Jr. High School. But, I am a big fan of the Noblesville, Millers. And, of course, my boyfriends football team. Except, he hasn't told me the name of his team. I know it is Anderson something. I love Chicago. and, Detriot. Chicago because it has so many good places to eat like Sluggers, and Gino's East!!. And, Wrigleyville is awsome!! CHICAGO RULZ!! Detriot rockz because it just does, home of the Pistions, Lions, Tigers, and Red Wings ya'll. And, the Green Lanturn is so good. They have tons of good pizza, and free popcorn. And, of course Detriot is the home OF THAT MOTOWN SOUND. If ya'll are my Daddy's age, and don't like Motown you SUCK BIG TIME.. MOTOWN RULES!!!! Somkey Robinson, Temptaions, Jackson 5, Supremes, Four Tops, Countours, Stevie Wonder, Jimmy Ruffin, ARetha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, David Ruffin, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Diane Ross, Mary Wells, and Edwin Starr. They all rock. Espeacilly, the TEMPTAIONS. My Girl, Stay, Ain't to Proud to Beg. OMFG. I love them. Well, tlak to ya'll lata.  ~Millers Rule the Court~
