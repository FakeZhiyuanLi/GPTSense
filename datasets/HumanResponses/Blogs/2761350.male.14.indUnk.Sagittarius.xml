      Well, another day, another hope crushed. Im not gonna go into detail about what it is, but alot of you should know... I hate myself...  I dunno, i just feel so at home with myself right now, because this is how i like to be. Melancholy. I want to be depressed, because it makes me feel so peaceful... But it never lasts, not my bliss... Never. Damnit  I just feel like crushing something, i feel like doing something, anything...  Just get me out of here, im suffocating under the grip of life, but im too afraid to let go. Someone help me. Anyone

      Yay for average days. My feet are wet from trudging around in the wet grass, but thats okay. Went out with a couple friends to the street today, and took a sign that read: "Poor kids, need money 4 food" We stood in the middle of the street, not expecting to get any money, but this guy drove up and forced a five into my hand, and drove off before i could give it back. Oh well, at least he feels good about it, and i have an extra five dollars...  Anyhow, ive been thinking about some things... some things people say to me, other than the usual "shut up" or "stoppit"... I realize that im just a wannabe everything... Theres only one thing stopping me from being suicidal, and thats my fear of pain... I cant even be angsty properly... So what do i be? Antisocial again? I wish i could... I just wanna stop being an asshole, i wanna stop being immature... But i cant...   Argh... Really annoying... i guess i should do my hw now...  ((Currently listening to Evil Town- The Vines))

      Wow, im slightly pissed right now. I.E. i wanna get my hands around someones neck and squeeze until their head pops off like those dandilions that i used to know the rhyme to... Damnit.  I freaking hate my life. I decided to play a prank with some friends on this really annoying girl, and apparently she had to be hospitalized... This is why i hate being immature... Next i miss my buss by seconds. im 20 feet from the stop, and waving to the bus driver, then he pulls out... Oh my life, a collection of little annoyances. I think im gonna go burn something...

      Another boring day, with my typical selves fighting over themselves. I just wish i could be the me i wasnt to be, not the annoying, loudmouth, stupid, and asinine me that i hate... Well, i guess ill tell you about myself  Name: Aaron Allen Occupation:Part time student, Full time idiot Age: 14 Likes: Everclear, music, and running his website Dislikes: too manythings to list. Intrusive people, hovering people, people who diss everclear, people who look angry when they think, people who are clueless, people who have strong opinions about things they dont understand... Oops, thats the WHOLE damn world.  Damnit, i feel like im about to fall over fowards, its really weird. Just like, im not quite stable... its kinda freaky, but its cool.  Anyhow, continuing the list  Losing passwords, being what i dont wanna be, and conservatives  Right. Theres your damn list. Now you know a little more about me.

      What do i say? I dont have anything to say...  All i have to say is... nothing. I have nothing to say to anyone. I just want to die. Drown myself, hang myself, shoot myself, cut myself... Anything to myself. Im sorry i cant help anyone. And so i cant even use myself to pull someone else out of a living hell, what use am i? Im sick and tired of being sick and tired, and i just give up, since theres nothing worth doing anymore. All im doing is rotting in an abstract shell of boundries. Maybe im wrong, maybe there is a hell. Maybe ill burn for the rest of life. It would be better than this  Anything would be better than this...  Throw me in the river and say a prayer.

      Out of my depth  lost in the air Falling faster like a broken elevator  Out of my depth  lost in the dark Waiting for the other shoe to come down hard  I cannot communicate like I wish I could I do not deal with my problems like I know I should  I am out of my depth I am out of my league Watching everything just slip away from me  Something bad is going to happen I can feel it deep inside There are shadows all around me Like a bad moon on the rise  I am in over my head I am in too deep here over my head I guess I should keep my opinions to myself I guess I am out of my depth  Out of my depth right from the start I feel like I was born with an invisible heart Out of my depth seems like everyday I can't find the words to make the good things come my way  I feel like I am faking it I feel like I am wrong I feel like I'm a guest Like I just do not belong  I am out of my depth every single day I just cannot find the words to make my monsters go away  Something bad is going to happen I can feel it deep inside There are shadows all around me Like a bad moon on the rise  I am in too deep here over my head I am in too deep here over my head I should seek some professional help Because I'm out of my depth Yes, I'm out of my depth And I am slowly going out of my mind  Oh, go away Make them go away Someday I know I will make them go away Make them go away Make them go away Someday I know I will make my monsters go away  I am in over my head I should seek some professional help I should keep my opinions to myself I guess I am out of my depth  -Out of my depth, by everclear

      Have you ever felt tired of living the same life? Ever felt like you just wanna run like hell, leave it all behind and find a new start?  I do. Im tired of my problems, because they piss me off. They're the only things that hurt me. So i have problems i shouldnt have, and am fine with things that i shouldnt be. I wish i could just hurt the way im supposed to. Why am i broken?  I guess im empty right now, and im running on fumes. Someone give me something to live for. One of my friends refuses my help, i have a sinking suspicion that another one is avoiding me because of something i said, and another one is just... well... Sort of immature. Dont get me wrong, i am too, but... I really need to have someone to talk to, not someone to make me laugh...

      More things to type about, i guess. Right now there's two sides of me bubbling over. More, really. One is my blunt side. my releived side. My selfish side. On the other hand, theres my sensitive side, theres my hopeful side.  I dunno, some things just put the world into perspective. One of my friends nearly died this weekend from an OD. It just makes me feel small. Useless.  I just want to help you. I just want to help everyone. Let me help.  And stop bugging me dad, im going to sleep.

      Hey guys, id just like to say to you guys, you know who you are. Especially you ben. Dont take stuff so literally. Do i take offense at things that are long past? Long changed? I'd like to think i dont...  Anyhow, today was interesting. We got to meet the last burmese princess, in geography, it was interesting  The only thing that ever made sense to me Is the words to a song from an american movie The only thing that ever made sense in my life Is the sound of my little girl laughing through the window of a summer night I sit alone in the back yard Wishing i could be inside Just the sound of my little girl laughing Makes me happy just to be alive -Art Alexakis, Songs From an American Movie Pt. One

      I s  t h i s  a  c r y  f o r  h e l p ?  Cuz it isn't. . . . And im sorry that the wind is blowing ! And im sorry that I never changed. ?  Is this a cry for help? Am I face first into a puddle of regrets? Drowning in pools of memory? Just go away from me  The blissful feeling Of the blood cooling in side my veins  Washes away all my  memories  Of the kid I  could have been  I could have been  just like you  filled up to the brim with  my problems  But instead I just draw them  all away  with one thin red line  Yeah, I was feeling really depressed right after school today, and if I had anything sharp im afraid there would be scars on my arms. I dont know why I get so mad. It just makes me afraid. I just want it all to go away. I just want to say im sorry. For all the pain i've caused. But I still want to know. If I put a hole in myself, will I leave one in anyone else?  Does anyone care? I know I care for some people. Jo, Ben, Nick? If some of those people died, I know I would be missing something.  But my question is how long would I miss something? I never hurt for long. I just hurt bad. I always bounce back. I dont want to bounce back. I hate recovering from stuff fast. It means I cant even look sad. It just hurts like a bullet for a second, then its gone.  Its always gone.  Why does my pain go away?  I want my pain back, if you're up there god. I want my pain. Give me my humanity. Give me my caring. Give me sanity. Give me strength. Give me what you give everyone. Please, god, please.

       Disjointed Thoughts   Been a while since i did a decent sized post. Kinda scary, cuz ive really been unstable recently too. Maybe i havent posted because im unstable, or because i didnt post i became unstable. Weird how everything can go two ways.  My english project is screwed anyhow, mostly because we suck, and we really didnt have a good idea behind it. A movie really isnt 3d.  Missed the school concert last night, and kinda annoyed about that. Hope you all did well.  Reading Siddartha by Herman Hesse for World Geography. Its an okay book.  Damnit, i dont want to go to math this morning

      Wow, im feeling sorta weird right now. One of my better friends actually pisses me off like no other, but on the other hand, he's really cool, and has helped me with my bipolar alot.  Argh, i dont know whether to snap, or to just be, well, normal... It really confuses me...  Well, today, i mostly sat around and did nothing, as per usual. We had a semi-cool guest speaker in math (math? guest speaker? dont ask). The guy is sort of autistic, but he has an amazing memory... He knows the location of every car store in colorado, and directions. Who needs mapquest? He's also really fast at simple calculations, and knows way too much about sports...  French was boring, as usual again... Nothing to do but watch the most confusing movie ever  P.E., our team won our 1st game! Go Us!  Science was boring beyond beleif. I GET THE DAMN SPDF NOTATION! NOW WOULD ALL THOSE IDIOTS IN THE FRONT ROW PLEASE KINDLY TAKE THEIR HEADS OUT OF THEIR ASS'S AND LET US MOVE ON!  Lunch? mostly boring, and stupid  English? Sebby taped over part of our movie, so yay for us? yeah, i got pissed off  Special Ed. My favorite class. Now, dont you get the idea that im retarded, and PLEASE get the idea that i was being sarcastic. The teacher is annoying beyond beleif, the people in it are, well, retarded, the whole thing is 50 mins of TORTURE  Geography. More depressing stuff about rape and war... My favorite...  And theres my (a)typical day... Hooray... Im so very very VERY interesting, arent i...  God im pathetic, giving out my life info to total strangers

My second reaction was restraining the incredible urge to beat the fucking shit out of the little god damned rat...  My only action was the first, although im regretting not slugging him in the face. It would have been damn well worth it.

      Damn, its been a while since ive written. Tired beyond belief right now, even though i spent the last 4 hours sleeping.  I also have to take a geography test soon, since i missed it today. On a different note, my inbox has 134 unread messages. Die spammers, die. *hits delete button on all the spam* I now have... 0 unread emails. Im pathetic, aint i.  Why do people send spam mail? I know i delete it on sight, i dont even open it. Are the 2 people in the world that actually open and read spam mail, then go "Hmm, i need this product" ((normally being an insecure male with an... uum... craving for size apparently... These things ARE disturbing)), click the link, and buy something that they never need really worth the cost of buying those cds with millions of emails on it? Thats like people who make virii. What the fuck is up with that? Some sadist decided that they're gonna FUCK with my machine, and sends me an email ((Spam just keeps popping up)).  "Oh look, an email with a weirdly titled .exe in it! Lets open KILLYOURSYSTEM2000.exe because im an IDIOT! yay!"  Wow, and to think that people actually open those. Like the lovebug one. How depraved and deprived do you have to be to open an email with an .exe attachment, from a complete stranger, that says i love you.  Answer: Extremely. In fact, you have to be so deprived that you start dreaming about that person for the 30 seconds it takes for the virus to load and blow the shit out of your hard drive, Yay for the socialy and technologicaly inept. Because thats what you have to be in order to get affected by that. Its amazing how many people click those things and get screwed. In fact, its so many, that they actually put out a MANHUNT for virus makers  Its a sad world we live in people, very sad indeed

      oh, fuck this. Ben, your possesions consisted entirely of a small BOOK.  And tarot cards  Which you lug around anyways. You know why i stopped the tarot with you? Because i fucking hate it when other people force their way on me. I know im a jackass, but so are you. You are too damn old for your age. Learn to fucking enjoy yourself. When shit happens, look away from the fan and continue. Dont continually stay pissed off about it.  Learn to have some fucking fun. Thats the only point of life. If it werent for the breif fun moments, whats the point?  What the fuck is the point?  Come on, people. Stop being so thick headed. If you continually moan about all the shit that goes on in your life, then youll never have a chance to salvage whats left of your shipwreck and build a new damn boat.

       Throw me in the river, and say a prayer.  Make me a martyr out of papier-mache and tears. Cut me down, hang me in the square call it a circle, call it unfair  Life is vicious, yes its true. Social cliques ripping reputations Life is stupid, you know its true.  You're just living a lie Holding up a tired liar  Broken boundaries, trustless   I dont know. I like the first 7 lines, but i had a hard time finishing it

      Damnit. Why cant a thankful mood last longer than 5 seconds without someone walking up to you and putting a pin in every one of your god damned balloons...  Damnit ben! Why do you have to be so stupid! If you depend on other people, nothing will ever work out. Forget it.  It didnt work for me.  Nothing works for me though, so you just go your own way...

      i wrote a few poems, so i thought i might as well let you read em    Most of them were written as lyrics... so....    1. Heartbroken Valentine      Hey, im a little lost  with this heart broken valentine    That you sent me    It says, in big tearsplatched letters  that i dont want to know you  I dont want to know without you.  You broke me, valentine.    You sent me  A letter  That told me  that you had  forgotten  all those things  i said to you  all those things  you said to me    And it said that you took  them back, away from me.    Take them back again.  and again  away  from  me    You broke my valentine.  You broke, valentine.  Im broken, valentine        2. Spendthrift love    I looked through the mirror in the wall the other day  it told me to tell you to tell me you still hate me    Theres little tears on my window  from the crying morning of dawn  Dampening the grass, with mostly dry eyes  But they still fog when i think of you    You gave me a rose for every year we spent  now i wish that id opened a bank account  just so that i could keep you with me still  instead of so far far away    in a happy glad wonderland beyond the happy glad bay  Will we ever meet again, so i may finally die happy          3. 3 left of tomorrow    its 3 more left of the tomorrow  over the sunset and behind the sunrise  after the meal eats the man,   and before the man eats the meal  Thats where my bliss is hiding        4. Sub-urban melody      In the little suburban world  with pretty pink fences  and chain link flowers.  with happy chances    And a SUV in every drive way  And cookie cutter houses  And a Perrier bottle in every fridge    Thats the good life        Seven    See my picture of  you in the mirror  with the little  rose wood frame    around it  it says i love you  and please dont take it away    its broken now  with little cracks  around a spiderweb  of broken glass

      Look, Theres something wrong with that picture in the window. Its all crooked. Almost like someone wants you to notice it more. Or they're just careless. &nbsp; Wondering why its a picture of you. &nbsp; Im wondering too. Maybe it isnt, Maybe... it just seems that way. Maybe it doesnt have anything to do with you. &nbsp; Or maybe someone is paying attention. &nbsp; If you go up to it, will it dissapear? &nbsp; If you look away will you never see it again? Do you even want to see it? Do you want to see what you look like? &nbsp; Is that what you're looking for? For who you are? Or is it for something different. Someone else. &nbsp; Who? &nbsp; Why? &nbsp; Why not? &nbsp; So what? &nbsp; Who cares. &nbsp; Maybe i do.

      Dont you love it when everyone yells at you? Just because i didnt ditch a friend for 15 mins to take the zip to meet up with someone else doesnt mean i dont care about that someone?  Am i just the emotionless ball of rubber i claim to be? Or do i really care.  I want to show someone i care.  Im sorry if i talk about boring stuff. What do you want me to do?  What do you want me to be? Why am i not good enough... I wish the people i love loved me. I wish someone truely liked me for who i am, not for who i pretend to be, or who im not.  Yeah. I overreact. Yeah, my mood swings. Yeah, i get pissed off when i have to walk through the rain both physically and mentally.  But, you know, walking through the rain isnt that bad when you care about the one who your walking for. Guess that means i dont care for myself. Oh well. So it goes.  I tried to look inside myself, and i couldnt see anything. Im nothing. And definately not like you.  I hate you, me. I hate you, because you stole what i could have of a life.  yeah, i know im wrong. Yes i guess i fucked up again. I always fuck up again, and again, and again, and again.  Why do i always stumble over my own words. Why am i an asshole. God only knows. If there is a god. If there is a god, then he surely is either testing me, or has already handed me over to the devil.  Who do i care for, really? How do i show you i care? How do i show them i care. If i show you i care, then ill be shunned. If i show them i care, ill be laughed at. So i dont care then. Those words bite more than anything else ive ever felt. "Well, i guess i care more than you." "You dont care for anything" They hurt. They really hurt. I can be refused. I have been laughed at.  But it hurts now.  why?  Why not.  Why do i write this senseless mess.

      Hey look, its another day of staying up late when im not supposed to. Ph34r m3.  Random song lyric time   Then they came on me                   They dragged me from the bar                   Still wet from sweat and beer                   I bruise so prettily by men blinded by their fear                   These men                   Broke my back and made me lame                                     Then she said to me                   I'd give you everything to make it like before                   To make you love me like you used to                   Make you love me more                   She said to me                   Your life is large but your mind is lame                                     I can't believe my eyes                   When I see the truth and all the things I've done                   And every place I'm queer                   I never stay I run                   I know now why I live in shame                                     Lame...                                     It's hard to sleep at night                   I hardly ever sleep at night  Lame- Everclear  It is hard to sleep at night now. Now, more than ever, with an everwidening hole in my heart.  You said by letting me listen and pay attention, you would hurt me, but it hurts me more that you wont. Oh well. Who cares.  Hey, i dont have a link bar. I should get one. But im too lazy. And listening to sad songs. Lame. I will never be safe, i will never be sane, i will always be weird inside, i will always be lame. And not the popular meaning of the word, but lame. Hobbled. One of the words that make me feel. woofuckinghoo. not that anyone cares. Some of you may tell me that i use fuck too much, but guess what. I dont give a  fuck . Nope, not at all. So, fuck, fuck, fuck. i palindrome i.  I make no sense when im trying  Got my new glasses today, and thank god i can SEE. Although it isnt all its cracked up to be. Now i notice things that i dont want to.  Oh well. I should hang out at bens house for no reason at all, or something. Go to the mall though i despise it. oh well, so much for the afterglow. oh well, oh well, oh well. Look at that, i should go to bed, instead of getting my mom pissed off at me.. Oh well again.  Look. 12. The clock striketh. And giveth me a nasty bump on yon forehead. I learned today that my neighbor died. Sad. Wish i felt sad. I knew him. But at the same time, i didnt. Oh well, who cares. I should light a candle for him, but id burn the house down. Not a bad idea, actually  Im getting too addicted to diablo. I need to stop playing. but if i do i cant start up again, since bens chara will be infinate times my level. oh well, thats enuf
