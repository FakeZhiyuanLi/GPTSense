       Is 45 to young to die? To take your life as  others wonder why?  Is 45 long enough to endue the pain of the past?  To stay alive for others sake's?  Is 45 not long enough  to wait around and  pretend your not in pain?  It seems to me that 45 is just right to say goodbye to all the pain as nothing  is to gain by staying around to be 46.

       Hello, Today has been a quiet day. I have finished making the bag holder doll for ray's Mom. She has lung cancer and isn't doing to well lately. We well be going up there to visit on the Fourth of July. It rained a little here today. My dog abby and I will go for a walk later when it cools down. when its a quiet day like this I think about the past and worry about the future. Today I was thinking about my late husband. Trying to remember what he sounded like. Ray my boyfriend didn't come home after work like he has always done on Mondays. I was fast asleep when he finally got home. He said he went to a bar to relax. I'm not a man so I probably just don't understand what that means. We have no kids and it's midnight when he gets home anyway so why can't you relax at home? sometimes I wish I had never put a personal ad in...dunno if I should worry or just chalk it up to men are men...night

I have a cold so didn't feel like doing anything. heather called wanting to come home from hospital. she just called again. she will be here around 6 to get her check.I feel scared  and tired. I don't know why I have to be this way. it's hard to live when you feel this way.

       Well this weekend was really rough for me. Ray had to work Saturday and Sunday become very depressed and thought of killing myself. The pain was so acute that I thought my heart would bust. I feel so worthless and useless when I'm in this mood. I can't see anything but negative things in my life. I crave to be different. To have a job and be able to walk among people without feeling panic and anxiety long to break the bonds and open the door to live a life without so much pain and terror. I remember going to school and feeling so out of place. I felt the same way at home. I have always been a people watcher from a little kid. I longed to be like them and I marveled at their ability to interact with each other. I kept these thoughts and feelings to myself cause I didn't want people to laugh at me. I was already being made fun of cause of my looks and cause I was in slow classes. My home life was difficult to say the least. I watched as my father drank on the weekends. He was very mean and abused my mom. He would say cruel things to my brothers and other sister. I don't know why I'm so screwed up though. He never beat me or molested me.Never said cruel things to me. He just looked though me as if I didn't exist. He never said hello to me or I love you criss. He never hugged me or played with me. I was terrified of him though. I guess I'm lucky to have escaped without any verbal,Physical or sexual abuse. Unlike my oldest sister who from the age of around 11 was raped by him. I didn't found out until I was grown that he would rape her with I sleep beside he. See I was just a newborn when it started and I slept with my sister because my mother was sick. My sister took care of me until she married at 17. So from the age of newborn until I was 5 my father raped my sister while I lay beside her. She said that she would pinch me to make me cry so that mom would come save her. But she never did and He would slap me while raping her to get me to shut up. I don't remember this but I'm sure it shaped me into who I am today. When I was around 8 I thought of killing myself by walking in front of a bus. Don't know what stopped me but at times I wish I had been brave enough to do it. I learned from the age of 5 that even though someone loves you they leave you behind.
