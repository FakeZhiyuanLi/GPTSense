       I have been seconded to London for six-months and have now been here about one-month. This is not the first time I have lived in the UK (I lived outside Cambridge for four years in the early 90's) and that certainly has made the transition easier. My familiarity with the grocery stores (I prefer Waitrose), telephone/utility companies and tax issues (one has to pay council tax and don't forget the TV license) meant that within three weeks of my arrival all of the major arrangements needed for day-to-day living had been made.  I am living in a very small, one-bedroom flat (less than 450 sq ft) in South Kensington very close to the V&A. Neighborhoods in London are small so I am  very  close (walking distance) to Knightsbridge and Chelsea and slightly further (1-2 miles) from Notting Hill and Holland Park. When I moved into my "furnished" flat I had two suit cases of clothes and 3 bags filled with sheets, towels and a few other items. Eight boxes arrived from the US a week later and my move was complete. As I became acquainted with the contents furnished with my flat I realized I would need to "fill in" if I was going to live there for six months. Some were small (measuring spoons) while others were larger (microwave, lamps and rugs).  Before I go too much further, I should say the obvious. London is expensive - or more accurately, very expensive. If you missed it, it was recently designated as the second most expensive place in the world to live in behind Tokyo. To give you some perspective, NYC was #27 on the list. So, in that background I began the process of buying what I would need to make my flat home for the time I am here.  In the US, I am an avid gardner so one of the first things I wanted was house plants. I heard about  Chelsea Gardner  (125 Sydney Street, Chelsea) and hoped I would be able to buy a few house plants. If you have a garden the Chelsea Gardner is the place to go. They have everything needed for a great garden - a good selection of plants (indoor and out) as well as garden furniture, pottery, gardening books and the all important wellies. If you buy too much to take home with you (don't drive, parking is horrible) they can deliver. The quality is good but don't expect any bargains.  At  Divertimenti  (139/141 Fulham Rd, South Kensington; Ph (0207) 581 8065) I was able to fill in my kitchen needs . This kitchen store has everything any cook would need as well as many things you might only use once. They have an excellent selection of cooking books but be careful about buying them with the thought of using the recipe's in the US. I have, with only minimal success, tried to use US recipes in the UK and vice versa. The only thing I can think is that the ingredients are different enough to really effect the final product.  I love the  Conran Shop  (81 Fulham Rd, Chelsea; (0207) 589 7401) - the high end shop of Terrance Conran. It has almost everything you would need to set up house - if you like more modern furniture, lighting, bathroom and kitchen accessories, etc. Even if you have no intention of buying anything it is well worth the trip. In my experience, Europeans love modern furniture. I think it is the antidote to all of the old architecture.  Over the next few months, I hope to give you a taste of what living here is like - some politics, some day-to-day and a few oddities. I also hope to give you some ideas of where you might go to shop or eat if you make it over.

       I woke up to rain again today - not something that is generally news here except that the weather has been so extreme. When I first arrived in mid-July it was the beginning of a two and a half week heat wave with highs in the upper 80's and humidity that made it feel much worse. London is not the place you want to be when it is hot (the way I would expect to feel about NYC). It was so warm that there was one night that broke the record for the hottest night  ever  in London (it was 79 degrees). That was followed by rain and lots of it. There have been flash floods in Cornwall, mud slides in Scotland and, in London, we have had many days were we are getting a months worth of rain in an hour (talk about traffic jams! - but that is another story). The interesting thing is that this has sparked a huge debate about global warming on Radio 4 (the equivalent to NPR) with the usual lack of conclusions at the end. It seems that indecision on this issue is not limited to the US.  The only thing that was able to kick it off the main news last week was the release of A level grades. For those of you who aren't familiar with the UK school system there are two "levels" after primary school. In my mind, I have simplified it to "O levels" being equal to junior high and "A levels" equivalent to high school. Now, I am sure if any of my British friends read this they would argue that is an over simplification but that's my story and I'm sticking with it. The big news was that too many people passed - 96% with about 25% getting "A" grades - and universities here complaining that they couldn't distinguish between the very good and the excellent. So, last week we all got to listen to David Millerband (I so wanted his first name to be Steve), the Minister of Education, talk about how this discussion was talking student's accomplishments down and basically trying to shame everyone into ending the discussion.  The thing I am really surprised about there is not more on the Iraq war. Compared to the daily bombardment (no pun intended) that we get in the US there is relatively little on the news here. Although when I ask friends and acquaintances about the war they all hate it. The problem for them is that Tony Blair is the only option for Prime Minister. The opposition is so weak that they could hold elections tomorrow and he would probably win even though his approval ratings are at the lowest ever. I also think that with less news time it is not first in many people's consciousness. And, (if I can go with this stream of consciousness) they don't appear to be as aware about the US presidential election. Only one person has asked me about it! I will be curious to see if this changes once Parliament comes back into session.

       Because I lived in England before and have a number of friends here, I have had a very full social calendar since my arrival. While I spend far too much time in the office during the week, my weekends have been full with dinner/lunch out, art exhibits and concerts and has minimized the time available to miss my life in the US (and in particular, my cats).  However, this weekend was the first weekend I didn't have anything planned. My closest friend in London was visiting her mom at home in Scotland, I had visited friends in Cambridge the weekend before and the other few people I knew were also out of town because this is the height of the holiday season. I was a little nervous about this first weekend "on my own" because part of what made me want to move back to the US the first time was that I spent a lot time alone (partly due to where I was living - Saffron Walden - a picturesque, small town in between Cambridge and London filled mostly with families). When I was deciding if I should take this posting, huge amounts of time one my own was, perhaps, what I thought about the longest before accepting.  The things you worry about are usually not what surprises you in the end and I have sailed though this weekend. Saturday's are usually about running errands because even in the 2000's a limited number of shops are open on Sunday. After the usual run to the grocery store, I headed out to Oxford street to run my errands.  John Lewis  (278-306 Oxford Street,Ph (0207) 629 7711) is the department store most frequented by the average Londoner and could be favorably compared to Macy's or Nordstrom with a few noticeable differences. John Lewis has  everything . I have many times heard American's who knit say that they were unable to find a knitting store in London when they were here. That is because Brit's who knit buy their yarn online, at John Lewis or Liberty. The selection is huge and one of the things that actually costs less than in the US. They also have a great stationary section. I buy almost all of my cards there - they have a good selection and nothing is cheesy.  If you have a little more money to spend I would recommend going to  Selfriges  (400 Oxford Street, Ph (0870) 837 7377) instead. This department store is amazing. It is really made up of mini-stores with all of the "in" designers represented. You can buy just about anything you can think of from a Dior evening gown, to an espresso cup, but, it is the food hall that I could spend hours in. If you are a foodie then you really need to make this a priority stop. My first stop is always the cheese counter. They have hundreds of selections and will give you a taste to help you decide. You can also buy limited supply olive oil or balsamic vinegar out of barrels. Don't forget the restaurants that are dotted around the store - each is a different cusine and an excellent place to gain your strength back by having a bite to eat.  Today I spent part of the day at the  Victoria &Albert Museum  (Cromwell Rd; Ph (0207) 942 2000). It is so close to my flat but I hadn't yet gone. If you have never been there it is truly a must for your next visit to London. My only recommendation is to choose one or two things that you would like to see and don't try to see everything because it is overwhelming. They are particularly known for their textile and clothes collections. One of the things I like best about the V&amp;A is that you can take photos anywhere in the galleries as long as what you are photographing is not on loan to the museum. After two hours I decided I had seen enough. I would save the rest for other visits.  One more thing before I close, my neighborhood is filled with Embassies. I noticed the Kazakhstan Embassy first. It is just down the street but it wasn't the building I noticed first but the special parking space in front. That's when I began to see the others - the only thing that says a building is an embassy is a little gold plaque (e.g. Afghanistan, United Arab Emerits, Iran, etc). The exception to this rule is the French embassy. When I leave for work at 7:30 in the morning the line has already started and is a good 20-30 people. The weather doesn't matter - they're there rain or shine. I have heard a similar sort of line exists at the US embassy as well - people trying to get in - and I wonder what would be the decided factors between standing in the US verses France line...
