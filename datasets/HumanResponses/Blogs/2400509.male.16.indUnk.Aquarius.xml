      I had been awake for three days, and I wasn't even tired. I was beginning to fear that I had some form of insomnia, and that I'd never sleep again. Sleep deprivation made it difficult to understand anything that was going on, and I don't think the drugs helped either. But as we all know, a well rested and sober person is not much in the way of entertainment, and I was determined to be as entertaining as possible. As soon as I decided it was time to leave the house.  Things started off innocently enough. I remained at my house for much of the first three days, smoking grass and watching TV. On the third day, I decided that I wanted a burrito. I staggered into the kitchen, and as I opened the freezer door, I heard an angry growl. The refrigerator had just growled at me. I wasn't quite sure what to make of that, but I didn't think it was at all a good thing. I thought now would be a good time to leave the house, before this monster of a kitchen appliance decided to act on its threats. I grabbed my shoes, and headed for the door.  Outside seemed very... bright. I had been inside, blinds closed, for three days, and now a single glance towards the sky nearly blinded me. As my eyes adjusted, nothing looked quite right to me. Had the grass always been so green? This road so long? Maybe things had changed in those three days I kept myself locked inside my house, isolated from the world. Maybe the grass was just fucking with me, but I couldn't be sure. In my current state, I decided that driving would be a very bad idea. I wasn't in the mood to be driving into any poles. Besides, locked away inside a metal box is no way to go cavorting about town, right? Before I had even finished my thought, I was walking. "Walking it is, then!"  Wandering. It's really all I do. I don't know where I'm going, but I keep going anyway. Hopefully, to whatever I'm going is good. Grocery store? In this state of mind? Not good. But I went. And the second I stepped foot inside the grocery store, I realized that I had made both the best and worst decision of my life. There was food, all around me. And in my pocket, money. Money that I would not have much longer. Money that will be u-  "Hey man, what's up?"  Whah? Is somebody talking to me?  "James, over here!"  Oh! It's Brian! "Hey man, what's up?" I ask, mimic-ing his voice. Somehow, I got the feeling he didn't appreciate that little touch.  We talked for a while, but he didn't have anything interesting to say. Brian never really does. He just kept babbling about lizard eggs and how they're so much better than chicken eggs. After about thirty seconds of that, I decided to be on my way again.  Your legs tend to take you to strange places when you're high. Places that you wouldn't normally think to go. Like the stop sign at the corner of Lexington and Riverside, for example. "Maybe I'll meet somebody there," I thought. Maybe we'll fall in love, and get married. And then, we'll start a family, and have some kids! Be we all know how that works. Soon, you're working nights at the office, and you're barely seeing your family. And that doesn't bother you one bit. You just grit your teeth and accept the horrible reality, the fact that you married a woman that you can't bear to spend the rest of your life with. Until one day- BLAM! You've blown your wife's head off with a handgun.  "No, fuck that," I said to myself, and I continued past the stop sign at the corner of Lexington and Riverside, avoiding that terrible mess of a decision.  I don't think this was something I really needed to worry about, though. Hell, I'm barely old enough to have my own place, and I barely make enough money to live comfortably on. It's a damn good thing I grow my own reefer, I've always thought. I would never be able to afford buying as much as I smoke on my current salary. I don't need this worry now, I thought. Especially not now. Lord knows I don't want to start freaking out, they'd lock me up and throw away the key if I started freaking out right now.  ...Where was I? Shit, I've lost my train of thought.  I must have blacked out for a little while. The next thing I can remember is...  [more coming whenever I get around to it]

         Crystal called today. That was really nice. I haven't gotten to see her, or even talk to her much, in almost a month. I'm only going to be here for another week, though. I really enoy being here with my dad and all, but I can't wait to get back. His wedding is this weekend, today actually, otherwise I'd probably be leaving sooner. School starts August 30th, which will leave me two weeks after I get home. There's a lot of filming to do for The Stupid Show in that time, since I wasn't able to go on the New York and Canada trip. Hopefully we can get most of it (if not all) done. I'm really looking forward to getting to hang out with Crystal again, too. That's probably one of the reasons I'm not dreading starting school, because it means getting to hang out with her every day in drama, and Psychology/Sociology (I think).  A couple weeks before I left to come down here, Crystal insisted I start coming over in the mornings to watch Dawson's Creek with her, since I'd never seen it. Now, if you know me, you know that I am a man that enjoys his sleep. If I don't have a reason to get up, which is usually the case, I'll sleep until 12:30PM easily. Watching Dawson's Creek meant getting up at around 9:30AM. Normally, I wouldn't even consider waking up that early, and I definitely wouldn't be watching Dawson's Creek if I did. I can safely say, though, that waking up at 9:30 every morning during the week to go over to Crystal's house and watch Dawson's Creek was probably the best part of my summer.  Now that I think about it, other than a few select things, this hasn't exactly been the best summer. Things between me and my mom have gotten pretty bad. I can barely stand to talk to her on the phone anymore, I don't know how I'm going to deal with riding in the car with her for 4 hours on the way home next weekend. She gives off the impression that she doesn't really give a shit about me anymore, and combined with the fact that she completely flipped out about me smoking cannabis, we don't really get along too well anymore. Most of the conversation on my end consists of "Yeah," "Okay," "No," and other one word answers. One minute, she's saying she loves how I think for myself, and the next she's jumping down my throat for making my own decision, one that she just happens to not agree with. I don't really want to go into my issues with my mother much more, though, because once I get started it's hard for me to stop. Needless to say, she's not my favorite person, or I hers.  Let's not end this post on such a downer of a paragraph, though. It's the first post, gotta end it on a high[er] note, right?  It looks like school isn't going to be too bad this year, actually. I'm taking art, which should be pretty fun. Taking drama again, and I'm sure that's going to be a lot of fun. Drama is a fun class, and it's populated by some pretty fun people. I'm also taking Psychology and Sociology, which should be pretty interesting. I've always been interested in learning about why people do the things that they do, and why they are the way that they are. Even if it's a little difficult, or comes with a lot of homework, neither of which agree with what I've heard, it should be worth the effort. The only thing I'm actually concerned about is lunch. The last two years, I've been stuck in the lunch that the people I want to hang out with aren't in.  Speaking of lunch and food, I've developed a powerful lust for a post-midnight snack. I think I'll go grab something to munch on.
