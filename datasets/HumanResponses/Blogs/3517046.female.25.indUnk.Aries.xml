      man oh man do i love me some fridays!!!!!!!!!!!!!  heres the crap part, i'm terribly excited it's friday allllll day. then when it comes time to party in the eve, i'm tired as all hell. bah! what is that? i'll tell you what... i should take a nap when i get home. like i did yesterday. damn, yesterday was crap! but thats the past and the past is old and boring so moving along...  RJ amd i were out at the bar with my long lost pal Hymie (hereby known as JM). love that boy! i had the biggest crush on him when we were on the RHPS cast. he crushed on me to but you know the story... im dating someone, now you are... blah blah. now he looks like a total thug and i love him... but i'm not gonna be sexing that up any time soon. ANYWAY, RJ and JM and i were out at regans irish pub. we met Travis, what a cutie pie! anyhow... RJ just immediately fell into the whole 'oh i like him blah blah'. she swears it takes forever for her to crush on a guy and it's such utter crap. she falls faster than i do.  anyhoo. i can only imagine where we will end up tonight... can you guess???? that's right... even money it will be regans. i'll wager further and say that T will not be there, neither will the last cute boy she crushed on when we went there. we'll end up a couple of sad, chubby lesbians drinking too much beer.   SHEYAH!!!!!! RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i'll be damned if shes going to doom me like that!  i know i need to get laid... it's been... about a month. and if i know that  I  need to... i  KNOW  she needs a deep one. so yeah. i'll let you know what happens.

       i dont work for you.... you're not the boss of me.... i loathe you.... you disgust me....   or at least thats what i tell myself every time i look at the people i work with. i am disgusted by every cute little shithead manuver they come up with.   i havent taken a break in three weeks. i am desparately behind 'the other' offices filing and they insist upon talking about me in the next cubicle. like im not even here. like im not wishing horrible things to happen to them. today, i threw about 40 peices of 'the devil's' mail into the shredder. she pissed me off. it's not my job to create files for these people. it's not even my job to put them away. (hence  i dont work for you ) but they are so quick to jump on my jock about things not getting done right away. well you know what... fuck the file... i filed it properly allright.   muah ha haaaaaaaaaaaaaa.  i drove to work today so not only am i leaving an hour early to make up for my lack of breaks, but i can fantasize... at least for a little while... of quitting in a very dramatic way.

      part... 2? who knows.   i am doing the work of 4... yes count them... 4 people. each office team is supposed to have a mail clerk and a file clerk and im doing both jobs for two different offices. the kicker is this... everyone wants to know WHY I'M FALLING BEHIND! and WHY NO ONE CAN FIND ANYTHING! let me tell you why... cause ALL OF YOUR SHIT IS PILED ON MY DESK TO BE FILED YOU SCHMUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i had the greatest job in the world. private little corner where no one bothered me and i got to listen to the radio all day (i have over 2000 songs on my comp at work.) and my job wasnt that hard. open mail. file stuff. no big deal. but then i had more and more and more and more and more of everything and now i want to quit in a reallty dramatic way. unfortunately, since i take the shuttle bus to work i cant do that. i cant quit in a dramatic way anymore because then i'd have to call for a ride home and how dumb is that? and if i were to really cause trouble there would be no fast getaway and whats the point then?   thank god for quitting time!

      and the terrible thing about stringing someone along is that sometimes they get pushy and pathetic. and this is the story of JG. poor unfortunate soul. RJ and i were haning out one night and we decided to go out and wander around downtown sac in search of the great american deep dicking.  drunk drunk drunk. thats that we got. and around 2 we wandered into a local dive for a nibble before heading home and passing out. it was then that we were called over by two decent looking fellows. having just finished the conversation earlier that night about how she's always the wingman. i always get the cute one. (which is absolutely true in my opinion as well so i feel particularly bad about it on this occasion.) so i make up my mind to sit next to the portly fellow, allowing RJ to have a seat next to the cutie. (always the way it goes. the ever present game of 'who gets the ugly friend?') (the exception would me me and RJ. heh. we're BOTH hotties.) so it turns out the portly fellow is real nice and grew up in my neighborhood. yadda yadda. nice conversation. we go home with them. RJ gets some in the cadillac, me? there is no way im sexing it up with JG. so i let him eat me out and all is well.   so the four of us go out a couple times, JG finally gets my pants off and it turns out that the big guy has a fairly miniscule dick and though it's sometimes true that it's not the size that matters. i say it doesnt matter so long as it's visible.   i'll admit, it's a lot of fun to let him buy me drinks, the occasional dinner. let him tell me how great i look and all that. it's nice to be persued. even if it is by a guy with an itty bitty. but after a while, the begging to come visit just becomes pathetic. and might i add... obnoxious! so last night it starts as a nice conversation and turns into me basically yelling at him that i'm not coming over. which really stinks because he buys me drinks and he smokes pot! and far be it from me to say no to free drinks and pot! he just makes it no fun. no fun at all.   i despise this quality in some people. the ability to take a really fun situation (for me at least) and twist it into something that sucks.   i need a new boy.

      today's mood: grumpy  i have hated my job ever since i started working. that is to say... all of my jobs. well, perhaps im being a bit too negative, but surely this isnt rare. start working, enjoy yourself for a time. then you get to know the people you work with and you discover that they are self infatuated scumbags that will spit in your face as soon as look at you. and the people you work FOR dont even know your name. (even though you've been handing them their faxes for the past 9 months. even though you bought the group birthday card that everyone signed EXCEPT for you. even though you were the only one in the office not invited to the staff party because you're the only one in the office that doesnt have inter office email because you're the only one that uses outlook express rather than the other ridiculous program that you dont even know the name of. even though that should be a non issue and i dont understand how my using a different program to WRITE and READ email could possibly affect my ability to even get an address. not that they would email me anyway because i used to be a temp.)   and a note on temping. i actually liked that a lot better than actually getting hired on because at least that way i had NO responsibility. very low expectations because i was after all... just a temp. so what happened? they interrupted my happy little world of ignorant bliss to a: give me more money only to take that much more away for "benifits" and even MORE because of a higher tax bracket. thats right... i now make less than i did before i got my raise. thanks G.W. Bush! b: give me a benifit package that i didnt select because apparently i turned in my paperwork late. news to me seeing as how i completed it the day after i was hired. c: insist on monitoring my every move even considering that i arrive before and leave after everyone else in my office.   in short i hate my job and i cant wait to tell you more. thanks for stopping by.

      ... so bugger off!  i used to work for the post office... and i'm the mail clerk. yes... i know more about the mail than you do. (the devil) so you can kiss my ass. don't try to fucking argue with me... and dont ask a question intended to but into a topic that doesnt concern you when you know nothing about the subject... because YES... i know MORE THAN YOU!   and by the way... what good is a date stamp (with today's date mind you) on a letter, when the letter won't go out untill three days later?  why the fuck am i trying to get the mail out on time based on the date stamp for? and of course the devil and RL completely missed the point that i was trying to make. basically... they being morons, puts me three days behind. 'it doesnt matter' well allright.... if it doesnt matter... kiss my ass and do it yourself.

      it's friday once again, and you know what that means... im tired as hell.   i know what you must be thinking... 'damn, this girls is negative!'. well you're right. i'm a very negative person. at least at work, i have very little reason than to be otherwise. i dispise the people that i work with. and i  should  just take them with a grain of salt. i  would ... if it weren't for my obsessive complex for hating them, and it truly is obsessive.  sometimes i feel like i am defined by my loathing. i am redefined by the level of my anger.   my assistants day balloon was deflated the day i brought RJ in to my office to check it out. we sucked the helium out and sang showtunes. perhaps the lingering of my nemisis assistant RL sappy (and huge i might add) assistants day balloon is a sign of the complete lack of a life that she has. thats a nice tought, i'll stick with it. perhaps she has no friends with whom to suck helium and be silly with. maybe she has lost the ability, incapable of being young. one poor sad soul who has nothing better to do with her life than get married to a guy she admittedly stole from someone else.   havent we learned anything from daytime talk shows? everything i learned about relationships i learned from jerry springer. rule number 1... once a cheater, always a cheater.   i give it 6 months. year and a half if she squeezes one out.  and now for my daily affirmation.  i may always be the last to know... i may not be taken seriously... i may be the forgotten one...   but what the hell are you  wearing ?

      there is a birthday in my office today.   the  favorite  assistant.   yay. she's 23. lets all kiss her ass.   my 25th came and went without note. that didnt borther me really. i hate the idea that these people would feign interest in my life. and im not jealous... seriously... so much as the thought just makes my bowels churn. there is something so incredibly disingenuous about their intentions. their lack of any sense of decency really chaps my ass as well. they are so secretive and self-righteous, about everything.   there was a time when i smoked pot every day before i came to work. and every day on my lunch break. nothing really bothered me then. not much has changed since then in my work environment, but i did lose touch with the albino kid i bought from. so now... i might toke before bed, or when someone at the bar offers. you can draw your own conclusions.   on another note it seems my chewy runts get crunchier as i proceed through the bad. almost as if they go stale from the bottom of the bag, up. once again you can draw your own conclusions.

      yesterday i hated everything. today... not so much.   the devil and her little spawn were next to their bosses cubicle yesterday and i came up to ask them a question and got nothing but wannabe ghetto attitude. right in front of their boss. um... assheads! totally uncalled for and they got reamed for it. (i dont even work for these people.)  so today is much nicer and its been agreed that im not doing their shit work anymore. YEAH! the little guy is finally the champion! thats right... i reign supreme. i have stood up to those bullies that abused my assistance and basically told them to "go outside and play hide and go fuck themselves".

      so what is it with guys asking for my number and never calling OR never calling back? are men really as stupid as women are?  the other day i met a nice looking young guy and we talked for a while before my class. he asked for my number saying 'i hope you call.' 'you're so easy to talk to' blah blah blah. so i called the next evening. no answer... oooooookay. left a nice polite message 'call me back when you're free, blah blah blah'. did he call? no. will he call? probably not. gah!  i should say here that, even though i am all about the chase... i don't play games. if i say i'll call, i call. if i say call me, i mean call me. i dont collect numbers for the sake of collecting numbers. thats just fucked.

      so my friend JM has lusted after me for like... ever. and there was a time when i liked him in a romantic way too. but it was one of those, i'm dating someone, now you are... blah blah. so it never happened.   ANYWAY. probably the BIGGEST reason for not dating him now that we are both single is the fact that it is so EASY to win his affections. honestly... i dont trust him around girls. i think his little mind is too easily manpulated by the opposite sex. i dont like that.   i like the chase.

      i seriously dont think so. if god were running against ralph nader, i'd vote for nader. this goes back to the whole issue of 'who would jesus vote for?'.   some are saying that john kerry should be more religious in his campaign. that americans want their leader to have a strong relationship with god.   i dont know about you but  I  sure as hell dont! i want him (or HER for that damn matter) to have a relationship with me... with you and with the bum on the corner. i would rather have someone in office that focused on whats going on down here rather that what  might  be going on up in the clouds or over there on the cross.   damn that makes me mad.   8 years of catholic school has taught me this much.  the teachings of jesus, abridged: hang out, be groovy to each other, have some wine, eat fish on friday. (i presume its because he knew red meat was harsh on the colon.)

      sometimes you make absolutely no sense. and you yell about it! and you scream and you claim you are being attacked. you WANT to be attacked! i swear to god she wants to be attacked for her beliefs. thats why she makes such wild blanket statements. she wants to be attacked so that she can scream about being oppressed. sometimes i just hate her.   i'm sorry but when you tell me you are not proud to be an american, but you're privileged to live here. you think the military is an "evil institution" but you support the troops. you have to be prepared to answer some questions and withstand a little scrutiny from me. thats just the way it is. especially if you up front tell me you feel this way because your dad feels this way. it's how you "were raised" doesnt hold water. it's not an acceptable argument. and it's not like i came out and said... you're full of shit. which is absolutely true. she is full of shit.   and it doesnt stop with matters of king and country. no no no. this is the way it ALWAYS goes. no "debate" as she says. "debate" does not equal you yelling your "opinion" at me.   why do i hang out with this person? why why why???? she drives me insane. sometimes i just hate her. sometimes i wish i would just say... "you are full of shit. everything that comes out of your mouth either makes no sense at all or is completely founded in an alternate reality. and you cant even explain it. you're insane. everything everyone has ever said about you is true. libras are not "balanced" as you say. at the very least... you arent. you are EXACTLY like your mother. you are NOT the sane one in your family. and you ARE NOT THE ONE WHO MAKES SENSE. and by the way, you are not as charming as you think you are."  and if you can't answer questions and defend your beliefs... i believe you're a great big poser.

      "i don't think you're an idiot and i don't want you to feel that way." ***look that says 'whatever'***  you know what... fuck you if you can't handle questions. fuck you if you want me to respect what you think and get pissed because i THINK you're wrong.  i'm really offended by the fact that she believes i try to make her seem stupid. really chapps my ass. i need to get away from her. she's sucking the life right out of me. and she burns cigarette holes in everything i own! and she's adopted so many shirts of mine it's not even funny. it's like having an over sensitive boyfriend who wears my clothes.   uck.

      okay, so RJ has the hots for travis, a barkeep at a nearby pub.&nbsp; he's totally hot.&nbsp; she's a total ass.   last night she wakes me up (i had gone to sleep early) to come out and have a drink with her. okay. sounds aight.&nbsp; i walk in, she looks at me and says... "wow... you chopped off your hair."&nbsp; travis says... "i really like it." i'm all thanks and smiles. i look over at travis and he says "i really like it, it's sexy." i say thanks very much and he walks away. i look over at RJ and she says,&nbsp;"he didn't say anything about my hair." and then adds, regarding my new do...&nbsp;&nbsp;"it looks like shit now, but i can see why you like it.   one question... what the fuck does that mean? does that mean you're a jealous bitch that can't handle someone else getting some attention? probably. does it mean that you are spitefull and mad because he didn't notice your trim and your new shirt, but DID notice i cut two feet of hair off my head? yes!   for as much as i complain about her, i do like her. but there is no shortage of things to bitch about.

      so i get this HORRIBLE email from RJ. which i deleted... which i SHOULDNT have... to sum it up it said 'i don't let you be yourself, i stiffle you. this weekend is all about you. wherever you want to go, whatever you want to do. we should find you a boy. blah blah blah blah blah.' and if that wasn't awful enough... she actually thinks she did make the weekend about me.  what a horrible person she is sometimes! she sent me this on friday... then friday night we went out and she totally ordered me around. 'i want to go here, i want to go there, i want to socialize' where did we go? THE FUCKING GAY BAR! um... maybe she thought i was a gay man and wanted me to find a boy there. so i'm sitting there with my friend JM and we are pretty much alone all night. hanging out with HER friends. with her sucking every drop of attention out of everyone around us. then we go to another bar, after she lets everyone know that i want to leave. (i don't know how she got that idea seeing as how she actually forgot we were there. and really i was becoming quite content just being her driver.)  yeah thats right... i got to drive. on MY weekend that was all about ME.  so we go to another bar, where we run into old roommates of hers that "kidnap" her until 1:30 am when she comes back and tells me... "you should go socialize, i'll watch JM." hello bitch! it's 1:30... who starts socializing at 1:30? the desparate! so i basically said fuck off and 'i want to leave'.  why am i friends with this person?????????
