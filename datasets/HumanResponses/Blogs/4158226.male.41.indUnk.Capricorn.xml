      God I'm bored. Only two weeks to go till the move, thank God - I am well ready to leave this town.  Have been spending time in the British Library. Read an interesting essay by Kingsley Amis entitled 'Why Lucky Jim turned right' (from a collection called 'What became of Jane Austen?'). Though written in the late fifties (with an addendum circa 1970) it still speaks to me. The effect of age on one's beliefs fascinates me: have written a few thousand words on the subject myself and may well continue it after my year of study is over.  The other book I'm reading there is 'Trust' by Francis Fukuyama. It's all about the vital role trust plays in building prosperous, stable societies and how it can be nurtured. His four detailed case studies are interesting, though perhaps a little eccentric to some eyes: the high-trust countries are Japan and Germany, the low-trust countries Italy and France. He argues that in Italy and France trust tends to reside in the family, and French and Italian people are therefore uncomfortable doing business with strangers. For this reason, though there are many small family businessses and large state companies there are not enough in between.  With respect to the US, he argues that it has always historically been a high-trust society with a vast amount of extra-familial networking, voluntary associations etc that go under the rubric of 'civil society'. Although this is currently eroding, which is worrying (Putnam has written about this in Bowling Alone).  I may take this idea and try to apply it to the EU for my dissertation. The task there, as I see it, is to try to bring high-trust habits and practices (as demonstrated in Scandinavia and other parts of northern Europe) to low-trust countries (which tend to cluster more in the south and east). To me, this should be a key task of the EU. The alternative, which sadly seems to be unfolding within the central EU institutions at present, is for politicians from traditionally honest countries to be corrupted by practices that voters would never stand for at home.  It's a question of standards. Do we try to raise everybody's game, or do we just sink to the lowest commo n demoninator? Do we want the EU to have the ethical standards of Sweden, or of Romania? (YesI know it's not a member yet, but it soon will be.)  Meanwhile, I have been in correspondence with the head of administration at the place where I am taking my course. Though impressed by all the places we shall be visiting over the year, I was surprised that there was no trip to Brussels/Strasbourg/Luxembourg to watch the central institutions in action. Surely any course that calls itself European Studies should have that as the first port of call? His reply was positive: he said he would forward my email to his colleagues and then ask my fellow students what they thought of the idea after we all arrive. Though heartened by this, I can't help wondering why this appears to be a brand-new idea to them.

      Where are all the hundreds of thousands of people leaving notes, enraptured by my musings? Am I doing something wrong?

      This blog is a bit premature, since I'm still in London. In fact not moving to Krakow till the 30th of this month. But what the hell, I wish I was there already so no harm in starting early.
