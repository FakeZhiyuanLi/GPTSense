      When my mom called and said she had a rooster and two chickens for me I was so glad.  This city girl is finally adjusting to small town life.  Was in the process of planning my first vegtable garden and now I would have fresh eggs.  Yes!  And best of all the birds were free.  Then I had to do the tough thing and build a chicken pen.  So off I charge in the yard finding this and that of fencing we had been using for the dogs pen.  Several hours later, hot and sweaty I had learned how to drive t-post and string fence.  Ok, it was a funny looking pen but it had shelter and a cover on top.  I was ready.  The birds were delivered and deposited and I was out throwing chicken feed like any other old lady.  Pretty proud that now I really did have a house with a picket fence in front and a garden and chickens in the back.  So a few weeks pass.  I learn how well chickens get out of the pen and how to chase them back.  Had to reinforce the sides and all, but had eggs and a rooster who crowed.  I had learned how to make a mud hole on one end of the pen when I went to get eggs.  The rooster had spurs and had flown at me a couple of times.  But the fence was always what had stopped him.  So if I made him mud he would dance around in it and strut around.  Then it happened yesterday.  I went to my lovely back yard with my lovely garden and my lovely chickens and...oh no the rooster was out.  Well I had walked the chickens back to the pen several times so let's just help mr. rooster back home too.  Or so I thought.  He had other ideas.  Apparently I had not done a good enough job of feeding him.  Or not made a good enough mud hole for him.  Or something cause here he came flying at me.  And then I started backing up.  But he had made contact and caught me good on the leg.  Spurred me well on each side.  Blood running down my legs must be something that made him madder cause he decided to attack again.  Well I am kicking at him now and trying to get away without turning my back on him.  Yelling the rooster is going to die.  After another direct hit from the rooster I now had 3 holes in my leg and one on my arm.  Safely inside my home I tended my wounds.  My mantra was the rooster is going to die.  Well he kept me holed up in the house for several hours.  Finally he decided that guarding the doors was a tiring job and it was time to go and attack the lovely garden.  So out I come again.  But armed with a light blanket.  Sure he will attack all I have to do is throw the blanket on him.  Scoop him up and deposit him back in the pen.  Easy enough.  Well who knew the rooster was on to me.  He took off running and flying overhead.  No way he was going to get bagged by me.  So after looking like the fool running around my yard with a blanket flying around and a rooster trying to see how he can lite on my head, I finally give up.  Now I am looking for neighbors with guns.  Yelling the rooster is going to die.  Well having no gun toting rooster killing friends close by I again retreated into the house.  Knowing that some way or other that rooster was going to die is what thought took me to bed.  With a now gimpy leg and hearing crowing first thing in the morning my resolve was even stronger.  Ready to start looking for rooster mafia was my next plan.  Then my daughter lets me know our lives have been saved.  A knight in shining armour with his white steed had arrived to help save us from the tyrant rooster.  Forgetting what a small town I am in my plight had been passed around and help had arrived.  Venturing into my front yard there stood the local animal control guy with my rooster hanging upside down in his hands.  I identified the criminal and verified he had lived here.  I willing turned him over to the animal jail.  Asking if the rooster was going to die, I was dismayed to hear "no".  He is off to live with others on a farm out of town.  Well I still go around muttering the rooster has to die.  So in effigy I plan on having roast chicken for dinner.

      I really thought I would be more regular than this.  But not surprised at myself.  I manage to get a few words out and then I have to stop.  Let my mind come togeather til I am sure it is the direction I want to go.  Oh but watch out I can take off like a blue streak once I am comfortable with a path.  There have been so many false starts in my life.  Oh it sounds good or would be the thing to do.  But once I do that very first time then I have to stop again.  Fear does it you know.  It does.  Fear of the unknown some may say.  But I know it is fear of commitment.  Yes your always scared to put one more thing on your plate even when it looks good.  You know that with one bite you will have to decide if this is something you want to eat regular or should you never have even took that bite.  Like buyers remorse with your life.  But you can't take your life back can you.  "Oh excuse me, I made a mistake and took the wrong path.  I would like to return this now.  Can I have my life refunded back to me?"  Would be nice but no we loose the time we invested.  Oh they say you have gained experience.  I have so many experiences I never asked to gain that I won't miss a few more.  Ok so today I sound like a chicken, too scared to scratch anywhere than the safety of my own little pen.  Well there are many days like that.  The one's I just want to sit in the doorway and look outside.  But do not feel like going out there is safe enough.  What is wrong with taking life in safe little steps.  Who said being the one who runs out to greet a day with whoops and twirls and jumps always comes out safe.  They too can trip and fall.  Sometimes they get up other times have a scratch on the knee.  But there are times the fall is hard and they spain an ankle or break a wrist.  Then they look back and see me.  Sitting in the doorway.  Being safe is sometimes what is needed.  I know that they say the condition is treatable.  But today I don't won't to be treated.  Today I just want to be a little more regular than this.  Humm.  Think I will go sit on the porch.  Farther than the doorway but not in the street yet.

      Today is doing better.  Actually have some energy.  Even if it is nervous energy.  Living with a breath that is half taken, waiting for a call that will allow me to take all the air in.  I have spent most of my life feeling that I just don't deserve air.  That alone is more than I can have, a full breath of air.  Do you have any idea what it is like to have to convince yourself that air is allowed to all.  No wonder that when I feel like not living I choose to suffocate.  Refuse to have air.  I remember as a small child how I hid in corners, under tables and behind furniture.  Holding my breath so that no one will notice me there.  And the longer I held it the safer I was.  But of course at some time I had to breath out.  So I would crouch there, listening to my family, and try and take the shallowest of breathes and hold on to them.  Then slowly let the air out.  I could not make noise.  They would find me.  And then all the pain would start again.  At 3, 4 or 5 years old you do not understand that you should feel safe.  You just know what life has given you.  Pain is what you see, feel, eat and breath then pain is what life is.  I still fight the urge to find somewhere to crouch down at where no one can see me.  To breath the shallowest of breathes and hold on to it for all time.  I have a loving husband and a wonderful daughter who want me to be happy.  To know I can breath all the air I want.  To not hide or disappear.  I am lucky.  I am healing and continue to see that life is not what you know it to be as a child.  That as an adult you can choose what course in life you want.  Today is doing better.  Today I breath.

      I had another panic attack last week.  It also came out of the blue.  They always do.  First time my husband has seen one.  Scared him so very much.  He tried to do what he thought was right.  But still he pinned me down and that makes me worse.  I don't know what to do when this happens though.  Went running off into the night.  Fear of being chased by demons not there.  Was told I was paranoid.  I don't remember it much.  Mostly just the feeling of fear.  It has been three years since my last one.  I have not told my doctor or case worker yet.  Don't really want to.  I feel so ashamed afterward.  And I hate people knowing that I was out of control and that I don't know why.  And that they must think awful things about me.  Any control I have showed them is now ruined.  And they don't think they could ever trust me.  So really messes me up.

      Well I said I was not sure what to do or how to handle a situation.  And of course when I just did what comes naturally all worked out.  Be straight forward and don't mince words.  So I did and he answered and all was made crystal clear.  No room for imaginations or miscommunication.  No I was not happy with the evening in question.  And my point is very clear.  So now we go on with life.  So my next step is that I need to get more motivation and energy going.  Here it is summer and I am just crashing on a daily basis.  I wonder if all the stress from the last 6 weeks is now effecting me.  It seems like I held on all I could before but now I am exhausted.  Hubby does not fuss about it.  Thankfully.  Nor does my darling dedicated teen daughter.  I could not ask for better from them.  So it is time to figure out how I am going to make a come back.  First I have to get my medication refilled also.  Then take it regularly.  That is the hardest part.  To take it I have to eat.  And that is even harder to do.  Eating has always been hard.  Lots of guilt there.  Enjoy food with people but never alone.  Eat out of loneliness and bordom then.  But sleep same way.  Today was glad that my daughter was gone and hubby at work.  So I could hide in my bedroom and sleep most of the day.  Hard to wake up though.  Sleep so much then want to keep sleeping then.  Feels good to just disappear that way.  And time passes and you don't notice it.  Depression setting in.  I know it but don't seem to have the energy to fight it.  Slept for several hours today and am ready to go back to bed already.  Only been up about 2 hours since the 3 hour long nap.  This is not good.

      Oh man I don't even know which way to turn.  Anger is buring through me.  I don't know weather to just come unglued or to do my best to keep a calm rational mind here.  Nothing happened in a way but at the same time the intent was there.  And my waking up is what stopped it from going any farther.  Of course I had to  just get up and leave right then.  Make sure safety was installed.  Then to deal with it all.  Men who are drunk and can't seem to sober up fast just make me madder.  Why is it a woman can see a situation and boom she is right back to game face and doing what has to be done.  And it seems men just wonder around lost.  Have to deal with others also.  What do I do.  Do I talk?  I feel like the abuse victum all over again.  Yet I was not the intended target at all.  Dancing around is not my style.  Families can sure mess up life.  No wonder I am always wondering why I have to deal with them.  So much easier to create your own families from the people you choose to be in your life.  Last night was suppose to be fun.  Friends showing up to make my husband happy.  Show him they are glad he is here.  Support and good times.  But of course unexpected family shows up and then this happens.  She is safe.  Not in my home right now.  But safe.  Yeah dashing out in the middle of the night to take her to someone else's home.  Makes me feel like I am really doing my job--NOT!  Oh men!  Bonding between them, brothers.  Where do you break in.  How much do you deal with.  Starts pulling in more and more.  Was way over the line.  Anger with a sweet smile on it.  Go through the actions.  Hi, welcome, choke and gag.  Make me ill with deciete.  Support your family girl.  Be mom, be wife, be all yet don't show it all.  Keep what your suppose to inside.  She is safe for now.  Where do we do what we need to do?  Have no idea right now.

      Oh my, I feel like a different person.  I have been so keyed up for the last 6 weeks that I forgot that I am a generally happy person.  I still have the crick in my neck from all the stress but it may begin to go away now.  My darling husband is back here!  I feel lost without him now.  It is wild to think that a strong woman can become such that the loss of a partner can make her weak.  I don't like being weak.  I like it when I am sure of myself.  Know what I am doing and where I am going.  And I understand that these down times are challages that I am overcoming.  Bit by bit.  But that is how it is for all of us.  Shoot by our fourties we are no longer doing hurdles and long jumps.  More of a skip here and there at best.  Also we know that there are traps we can fall into if we do not examine the path closely.  Use to be able to get out of them easier but now our climbing has slowed down and we tend to be more careful.  Nothing wrong with that.  But I still mark milestones with drastic measures.  Don't know if I will ever learn not to do that.  This last 6 weeks has taught me how much my husband does mean to me.  It is not enough (for some reason) to just have a wedding ring on to note I am his.  Or his last name attached to mine.  I wanted something more.  Something daring.  That would be just for him to see.  Hummmm.  Wonder why I at 40 I am looking for such drastic measures.  Is it my own mid life crisis telling me I am not young anymore.  Wanting to feel like a 20 year old who is just looking at life?  I know I may regret it, but I really dont feel that way at this time.  Have to say (sad to have to though) that this is my last husband.  I do not like knowing that I have failed in marriage before.  I understand the first one.  We knew we would not last.  Miss him so, he was a great friend.  Too bad he could not hold on to his life and see what we all saw in him.   But when I married my daughter's dad, well that was suppose to be it.  15 years is not like we did not try.  But we were both so sad togeather.  And now my happiness could not be more appreciated.  Still I had to do something this time to get my life jump started again.  So why a tattoo?  Pretty permant I would say.  And a name on it.  They always say do not put a name on.  Guess I really do feel that this is it in the hubby department.  Well one day I will be older and laugh at my wicked ways.  Funny I dont think this will be on the top of the list.  But I am sure it will always put a smile on my lips when I think of it and him.  Not a bad way to affirm I am alive and happy once again.

      Well today is the day for that road.  Not one that I would choose to travel.  But what is waiting for me at the end of it will be worth the trip.  I have dealt with the worry for about two months now.  I think I know what the outcome will be.  But we always have the unknown element there.  And to not be in control is always hard for me.  And the expense.  Whew!  Sometimes you do not know where you are going to draw from.  But there are things along the way that just make it work out.  When I started this last venture I had taken what I could for the last two months and said this will have to do.  Don't have to buy this and can make that last til we scrape togeather something to make us feel like we will have a start at least.  Then here comes someone with an extra jump.  One you did not expect.  So you say thank you and then you look up and thank the other provider.  Sometimes it is just what you asked for and others times what you never would have guessed.  This time it was a kitten.   Yeah a kitten.  I was asking for money, time, reassurance, a car and swiftness.  But no a kitten called my name.  I should have known my name is pronounced with a pitiful meow.  I have heard it before.  So hearing it this time I turned around and started looking for the owner of that sad voice.  I spoke back and sure enough there was the same voice calling out meow.  Tracking it I came to a car.  The engine hot from the noon day sun.  And a crying emitting from it.  You could hear the fright there.  Well here I am in a parking lot 200 miles from home to start with and now I am messing with a car that is not my own.  Trying to get this sad baby to understand that if you got in there you can get out was not working.  And so I start looking for owners of the vehicle.  Finding I now am gathering others who start to understand the kittens plight we find another obstacal.  The hood release does not work on this car.  So we have to find how to jerry rig the wiring to get it opened.  Meanwhile some are trying to go under the car and coax the kitten out while others are trying to dismantle the front grate.  Back and forth, men and women, english and spanish, straight and gay we have all sorts of potential conflicts.  But none of that enters in.  Cause we all can hear the meow getting fainter.  Of course all these people you know it won't stop til we get in which we do.  And there trapped by the hot battery is a small grease covered blue eyed black kitten.  Panting so that a dog would be jealous.  Having to remove the battery and some hoses we finally get him out.  After time to cool off, a good bath and trips to get all the kitties neccessisties, I see what this really is.  Not what I asked for.  Not money or time or safety.  No it is control.  Yes control of my senses to hear a cry.  Control of a rescuse much needed.  And now control over a kitten who needed help.  And in all of it I had calmed down.  Changed my focus and could now see the road less travled.  Yeah there are some bumps and curves but it is just a road.  And it has a destination.  And I can handle that conflict once I get there.  But for now I have a kitten to pet.

      Well since my husband has been home, life around here has been busy.  Especially the weekends.  It seems we have at least 4 to 8 extra people here each weekend.  And that is getting exhausting.  Also I have been really tired here lately.  So sleepy and just plain ol' out of energy.  My chores are not getting done and I seem to be able to do one or two things and then I have to rest.  Or I feel like I am going to faint.  Also been having alot of blurred vision also.  I will be having some blood work up done here pretty soon.  Also I know things are not going to be any easier.  We are going to have a friend move in for a few months while they start thier new job and have to save for thier own home.  And by the end of July my daughter will start band camp and track practice.  She has been checking into a few different colleges and also the Navy.  Trying to decide what she is going to do after she graduates this year.  And on top of all of this we have 4 new kittens in our home.  So busy busy and tired.  The garden is getting pretty wild and I am way behind on my weeding there.  And we have added some 5 chickens and a new smaller rooster to our 2 guines.  Going to have a farm one day right here in the middle of this teeny tiny town.  Well I guess I can read this and better understand why I may be so tired.  Thanks for listening to me fuss so I can make sense to myself.
