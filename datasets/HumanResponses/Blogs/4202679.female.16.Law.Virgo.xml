      hehe! i'm a sucker 4 poetry..i wrote this impromptu 4 hafez..give comments on it aite? here goes nth ;  Love like many things is pure and simple It roots from one's heart n spreads through the soul Awakens one's senses, ensnares one's mind Yet leaves u alert, afraid yet bold  Ur arrival in my life, like child's play it starts Ur memories in my heart, never ending it stays U entered my life w d subtlety of light N juz like tt, u lit my heart ablaze  Ur love 2 me, is a true essential D arrival of sun on a bleak winter's day N thus due to tt, i fell hook line n sinker For ur eyes, for your heart, for your sweet, sensitive ways  Now listen my love for i'm in this real deep For love like life "Its a tangled web we weave.."
