      My house is spotless and it's over 100 degrees outside...way to hot to work in the yard. I got a call from the temp agency...they are sending my resume out to a good co., but entry level...I'll take it! Will keep you posted.  I should be working on plans for my daughter, son and husband's birthday party (surrounded by Leos!) which will be this Saturday, but would rather hang on the computer. The less I have to do all day, the less I actually get done. I hate that. I keep telling myself that I need to relax before I go back to work...for the love of god I need to get back to work...but the guilt floods in anyway. I have spent the last three hours checking out other people's blogs...I'm addicted!  My son just got home from his first day at a real job...working on our neighbor's grandfather's farm. He seems pretty excited about it. Cool. I have been terrified that he would be a total lazy ass...but I think most teenagers are total lazy asses, aren't they? He's a great kid, he's gonna be just fine. He wants to be a doctor. I would give anything to see him reach that dream.  I think I'm gonna turn this thing off and find something constructive to do. Later.

      i love photography. i don't take very many good pics, thank god for digital, but i love it. there is nothing like looking at a beautiful or intriguing photo. my hope is to some day make a living with photography, whether i'm a photographer or just work with them on my computer. i love it all.

      ok, back to the bitches from my last job. the beginning of my professional demise was kicked off by a woman i will call barbara the ball breaker. she is definitely the coldest bitch i have ever met. it was so deceiving, too, because she looked like a kindly grandma type...wouldn't hurt a flea.  btbb came to our office as an interim executive director because we had just gotten rid of our last executive director. when i say got rid of, i mean it. we had to hire a lawyer and everything...but she's a whole other story that i will get to in time. anyway, btbb started out harmlessly enough. she came to me one day and told me that she could tell who did the most work around there because their departments got talked about the most...meaning me and one of my best friends, dee, who was in charge of girl activities and summer camp. ok, that's great, it was the absolute truth...and i'm not being biased, we were the busiest people in the office at that moment, having many large projects going at the same time.  well, after b had been there for a couple of weeks, it was apparent that she was the type of woman that would not be there as a figure head, she would be there to CHANGE EVERYTHING! and i don't mean big important things that were really going to help out the office (it has been operating at about $100k in the hole for the past three years and is getting ready to close if something drastic doesn't happen). i'm talking about making everyone fill out time sheets for the first time ever, making each employee write down everything that they did each day (at least an hour was spent, each day, on paperwork such as this), getting together for four hour meetings each week to discuss how we can all help the council financially, she even pulled an old management plan out of her ass and demand that we all start reporting to it...even though we hadn't seen the damn thing in at least three years (90% of the plan no longer applied because of major changes in the office). just stupid stuff. creating new forms for everything that she didn't like, that sort of thing. well, as i stated earlier, my friend, Dee, and I were extremely busy at that time with projects that could not be put off...annual meeting, summer camp, publications, pr for camp, etc. soooo, we could not participate fully in btbb's madness, it just wasn't possible. well look the fuck out!  btbb freaked. she started sending me nasty e-mails about how i wasn't doing anything that she thought i should be doing, that i was missing too much work (i was coming in early and leaving early for one week, something that was common place, but she couldn't figure out why i was leaving early), blah, blah, blah. then she started telling other employees and board members that Dee and I weren't really doing the job that she thought we should be doing (meaning not helping her with her crazy projects) and that the position that Dee held was usually reserved for much larger councils an couldn't be justified (ok, whether this is true or not, that isn't dee's fault, that's the fault of former administration). this went on for the entire three months that she was there. she would come to us for little, insignificant jobs, just to see if we could fit them in...sometimes we could and sometimes we couldn't. we didn't know it at the time, but she was absolutely livid about this.  the shit hit the fan after btbb left. by then, dee had had enough of the whole mess and found a new job, so i was alone for the thrashing. upon b's leaving, over $50k in raises were given...to everyone except dee and I (don't forget the fact that we are already $40k in the hole for the year and it's only July). no joke. that bitch got the last laugh. she fuckin hit us where it hurt. not only that, she got our work week changed from the 35 hours a week that we were hired at to 40 hours a week, with no adjustment in pay (this amounted to more than a $2 per hour pay cut!). no shit. all because we were not at her beck and call every moment of the day.  let me throw in one element that i hadn't mentioned before...all this time, the three bitches in the office who were either in a lull because their departments were slow at the time, or because they just never did shit anyway, were right there by btbb's side...kissing her ass and doing anything they could to make sure that their spots were secure. in contrast to that nausea, dee and i looked like total rebels. bottom line, we were penalized for working our asses off. but wait, there's more...

      my job search is not going well at all. it's been less than a month since i quit my job, but i'm already freaking out! we have enough credit to get by for about another month before we have to consider bankruptcy...this totally sucks. i've even pulled out all the stops and registered with a temp agency. well, not much i can do but hang in there and hope for the best. the job market sucks right now. i'm hoping that when all the college kids go back to school it will help. YIKES!  i got an e-mail from my step-son today. he just moved to anaheim to go to a computer animation school and is trying to find a job. he said when he goes to a business for an application they say they have none and he can see a big stack of them on the counter...he says they hire mostly hispanics and asians and have no use for sk8er guys like him. i was cracking up. poor kid, the real world ain't all it's cracked up to be. all i can think is thank god he is going to college.

      the very first thing I must go off about is catty bitches. holy shit women suck. they are the most competitive, back stabbing, vicious creatures in the world. i know that i'm one of them, but i prefer the company of a straight forward, no bullshit male any day. i don't know how men put up with us.  is it fair to say that there are different degrees of catty bitches? it's my philosophy that the more "girlie" the girl, the more catty she is. this has been my observation anyway. this may be because i am not a girlie girl and neither are most of my friends. and no, we are not lesbians and yes, we are all fairly attractive, but we are the type of chick who guys don't mind hanging with because we're "cool" (their admission, not ours).  i'm thinking about catty bitches a lot these days because i quit my job a few weeks ago and have been moping about not finding another job. i worked for an organization for girls (i won't name any names for fear of having the queens of catty unleashed on me with a lawsuit or something), but you will probably figure it out. the organization wasn't the problem, it was the fucking bitches who work and volunteer for the organization--and when i say fucking  bitches, i mean cunts. now, i don't use that term lightly, it is reserved for the scum sucking bottom feeders in the sea of womankind.  i worked at this office for almost four years as the communications director and loved my job. it was perfect for me. i could demonstrate my creative genius on almost a daily basis. but, in the background of my employment nirvana was this constant undercurrent of cat fight. no joke, there was never a day when someone wasn't struggling to overthrow someone else. oh, did i mention that all of the employees were women?  anyway, i can't sum this up in one posting, it would be the longest post in history. instead, i will throw it in here and there as it enters my brain. bad medicine is much better taken in small doses. for now, death to all catty bitches!!
