      So I could not post in my friends bloody Blog without an account here. I hate being&nbsp;a waste of space.. so thusly... I post.  The name is Joshua Smith, the nick name Mord is a desperate attempt to be recognized as a special fluffy spiritual entitiy with out having to go into the painfully irritating subject that is my spiritual-oneness... Come one.. naked bearing my soul? No one wants to see that.  And just to point out.. Mord.. is short for Mordaith... No one calls me that.. except like... oh maybe 3 people... in the entire history of me being alive... so... Do not feel obligated.. Ironically it would probally cause me more discomfort than anything... but.. I move on.  I'm inspired by The Good Doctors Blog.... and well... I feel the need/urge to review something. But my thoughts on movies... not really worth it.. I'd prattle on about this .. or that.. and loose sight of any artistic quality... Besides.. .I wouldn't know artistic quality if it jumped out of the shadowy hole that is my house.. and bit me square in the butt.  So I think I will review life. I'll just.. take portions of reality and subject them to my careful discerning gaze....  ...  Or maybe.. resturants...  No reality it is. I have nothing really that I can think of.. I don't want to force something, so, I'll just wait until inspiration hits me. I'm fairly sleepy, it is almost 3am... and I do work in about... 13 hours...   or something like that.  Anyway. Jesse is going to reject the concept that I know him... now that I've filled this with smatterings of 3am-ness.  Later People.  -Josh

      This was going to be a bitter look at my own spiritual belief system... How ever fate seemed to have it out for me. Every time I sat down to write it out something happened... Like a phone call.. or an unexpected visitor.. or I'd get half done.. and this ol' machine would crash harder than me after 3 days of soild gaming.  So... Todays post is why I love life. Most of my friends probally could agree that I've been a tad bitter lately.  So.. here are some reasons I love life.  One. My friends and family. Yep.. with out this lot of people my life would be pretty pointless. My family are like friends... and my friends are like family.  So I'm pretty lucky. My family allways supports me and I get along great with them. Even my wacky parents... whom, if you know, understand tomes about me...  My friends... I feel the need to say a little more about.  My friends allways have my back.. even when I'm making some obvious brain dead life choice that will haunt me for three or so years. (wink). My friends have lobbed "Phat Stacks of Cash" at me when times have been tough. They never ask for anything in return.  Any hour of any day.. I can find one person who will listen to me go on about what ever minor problem is ruleing my mind at the momment. And that poor person usually winds up being the same lad who's Blog lead me here. (thanks for last night by the by... man.. was I filling up the cup's of butt angst)  So.. yah.. my friends and family are a huge sunshine spot in my life.  Also.. I have my major hobbie. Which is RPGin'. I will admit NO SHAME in this. I love roleplaying games. I'm not one of those creepy obsessed with RPG's and will do nothing but. I mean I like nature hikes, reading, writeing, watching the more-than-ocasional-movie. But I've invested alot of time and cash in to RPG's and I have so much fun playing them.. and running them. Mostly running them.. I just get this buzz when I run a game... as long as I can see the players enjoying themselves.  Other good things.  My cats! I love my Cats! Oz, Shade, and Pook... The three amigos.. or.. two amigos and an amiga... or one amigo... one amiga... and one sexually confused cat.... or something like that. These three furry friends allways make me smile. Even when Shade is in Heat.. or Oz's is being a jerk... They allways come to me when I'm blue and cheer me up... A shimmy on who ever says animals lack soul. These guys know when I'm sad.. and actually make an effort to cheer me up. You can actual see the emotion reflected back at you from these guys. I don't really look at them as pets... more like...  Lazy Friends whom I have chosen to provide for.  What else? Well. there is my own personal spiritual oneness.. But I don't want to get in to that.. it will turn in to a rant.. and no one wants an ranting Josh with a religious bone to pick.  I am sure there are other things that make my life good. But those are the key points... So when it boils down to it.. Friends, Family, Fun, and... Fuzzies?  or... so that last bit makes me sound like i'm in to some kinda suit wearing fetish...  and with that. Later! -Josh

      Well it's time for my first reality review. Now I'm not aiming for clever or witty. I'm just spouting the words that come to me oh-so-naturally... By the way, as my english major friend will be quick to point out... compared to the average person around here I fear I may be functionally illiterate. Anyway.. back to reality.  With out further wait... The review of my new home on Brittian Street.  About 20 days ago, the province of New Brunswick sent one of their hired thugs (an rather nice man actually named Mr. Merit) to inform us that because our land lord was a rather large disapointment to humanity and thought that letting 80,000 dollars of ancient electrical repair go unchecked... thus placeing our building now five months out side the realm of the Code of the Building Inspectors.... we needed to find a new place to live.  Well, long story short, after not to much looking, and a whole lot of panicing, we were able to find a new place of residence.  Brittian Street. Located deep south, South End. My warning flags went up. I had visions of needing to start getting the Briggsian Consortium(My friend Steves Goons) to escort me home every eveing. How ever after meeting the upstairs tenents, who I knew, and meeting the land lords them selves (A wonderful couple named Larry and Louanne) I was thirlled.  The place has a strange bit of charm to it. It's older, and there is some work to be done. However it is big, and much nicer by default than some of the other .... slums.... I have lived in. The entrance hall is sizeable. When you enter, the main bed chambers are located on the right. These are three fairly small rooms. This was disheartening. Mostly because only the smallest had a closet and none of them had a overhead light.  Too your left when you enter, you find two large parlours. These large rooms are connected by a set of double doors. Both have overhead lights, however the switches are located in the main hall.  As the large hall way goes on you find yourself at the classy looking bathroom... ok.. by classy.. I mean it dosen't have large gapeing holes in it, nor does it reek of the neighbours pot.  Beyond that section, the hallway opens up in to a modestly sized living room. Now this carpeted area has one major flaw... besides the closet not opening... The floor boards that lead to the kitchen are massively warped to the point of horror movie creepiness.  As said this room leads in to the Kitchen/Dineing room which is spacious... but could only seem that way considering the complete lack of major surfaces. There are no... may I state again.. NO cupboards. But we have a really nice pantry.  Beyond the kitchen a screen door leads the adventureous in to our laundry room. And another set of doors takes you to our small excuse for a back yard. Did I mention we also have a coveted South End Front Yard (Aka.. patch of partly growing green vegitation?)  Now with Steve and I chooseing to risk life and limb and take the conjoining parlors as bedrooms. And Kelly taking too smaller ones as a room/study. We've begun to settle in.  Larry and Louanne are hardworking good and honest people. And they really care about people and thier property.  The cozyness factor is also something I admire.. and did I mention the sazzy mouldings everywhere... I do swoon over such old mouldings!  On a Reality Buster Scale of 0-10... I would Rank this place as an initial 8. Which is what I would rank possibly the nicest home I ever lived in.... 90 Queen Street.  What this Brittian street home lacks in the "Pretty Factor" it makes up for in character and awesome Landlords. 90 Queen was great... and I liked the landlords.. but it was pulling teeth to get any work done.  Anyway.. so.. 8/10... GO BRITTIAN STREET... YOU CAN DO IT LIL' GUY!  ...  I'm out.  -Josh
