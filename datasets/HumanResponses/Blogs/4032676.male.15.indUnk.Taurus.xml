      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a time there was a very smart paperclip who lived on a sheet of&nbsp; my homework. He was very small, and young, recently made by the paperclip company, and was looking for a new home to become attached to, literally. Only one problem, paperclips are born without any movable joints or bones. So, of course, that issue made it hard for him to move, obviously.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day the paperclip decided that&nbsp;it was tired of being moved by people and it thought about trying to make a way for it to move around itself. So the paperclip, whose name happens to be&nbsp;Papa Clipp, invited his friend,&nbsp;Bally P.&nbsp;Pen the pen, over by calling the human's neighbor on the telephone. Bally wrote down everything in papaclippo language, a very advanced language only used by paperclips.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Papa Clipp called more humans on the telephone to bring their paperclips&nbsp;over, so that&nbsp;Papa Clipp could have a big paperclip meeting. Then together, the paperclips built, only the paperclipping God knows how they did it, a great, paperclip-running, paperclip-mobile!&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow," said the group of dumbfounded paperclips.&nbsp;Yes, Papa Clipp had created the greatest paperclip-mobile ever made, ever.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Papa Clipp went on his adventure in search for a new place to "hang" around. He brought his very close friend, Metallyn Wire, who Papa Clipp was actually dating. He didn't want to leave Metallyn alone, so he brought her with him. If you think about it though, it would kind of be hard to date when you're a paperclip, but anyway, that's not important right now.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped at a clothing store for paperclips to buy some clothes for himself when, at the corner of his eye, he saw it,... his new home. It was a piece of paper that was littered from some inconsiderate, person of the world, who didn't give a hoot about anyone but themselves. It wasn't the fact, however, that it was on the ground that caught his attention. It was the fact that it was a license of a clothing company badge that someone had dropped by accident, and underneath it was a un-papercliped piece of paper that needed to be papercliperized. (long word, I know)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Papa Clipp drove his paperclip-mobile over to the paper and felt sorry for it, so sorry, he couldn't put it into paperclippo language. He picked up the poor, shriveled up, piece of paper, and held it in the paperclip-mobile grabber that was a new attachment. He felt so proud to be able to have the honor of holding&nbsp;this great thing. Papa Clipp began to cry. He cried, not in sadness, yet in happiness.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Papa Clipp and Metallyn Wire both held onto this piece of paper with a great effort, to make sure that this paper would be happy again. And both Papa Clipp and Metallyn Wire lived happily ever after, at least until the license was returned to&nbsp;its&nbsp;owner, because the paper that was attached to the license was a ticket. The mad&nbsp; owner got so upset that he threw the paper in the garbage can, tossing Papa Clipp and Metallyn Wire with it.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe," said Papa Clipp,"maybe it was meant to be."   &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Papa Clipp and Metallyn Wire&nbsp;lived to be seventy-two. They spent their life in a dump with plenty of resources to keep themselves busy. Papa Clipp was written down in the book of famous Paperclips as "The Paperclip Who defined and invented travel for the modern paperclip. Of course, now, the paperclips use teleports to get where they need to go. (invented by Colorful Designed Paperclips Company, (CDPC) ) But Papa Clipp really did start it all. So now he will be also known as The Genius Paperclip.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;THE END   &nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was at a party and there was no parents. I saw a couple people making out but i stayed away from them, to avoid that type of situation. My friends were here, both drunk or high however, and sweet talking some girls.&nbsp;There was Beer everywhere and i was so scared that temptation would override wat was real. (if u no wat i mean). I sat still for a while not knowing wat to do.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What should i do?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl, who was obviously drunk came up to me and sat down. She said some pretty sexual stuff to me and i didnt no wat to do. Should i get up and go away, or stay there and see if she leaves?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just didnt no. I tried to call my parents and then remembered, they were on a trip. I didnt no wat to do still and i began to hallucinate. Should i have a few drinks and forget my troubles or try to escape this tempting situation?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started to drift away from my body, traveling in time. I started to see the future. I decided to drink, and do drugs, and have sex. The police came after someone had called from the house next door. I had passed out on the floor and couldnt move.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I woke up. I was in a jail cell. A JAIL CELL? how... what...when...why am i here? A police man approched the cell and said U r in big trouble!&nbsp; I didnt understand what was going on. He asked do u remember wat happened last night. I was sleeping i said. Wasn't i sleeping?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont remember. He told me that i drank lots and lots of beer. I had Cocaine and Marijuana in my body, and that i got a person pregnant.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was shocked. I dont remember that happening. Now ur on probation because of wat uve done. Your spending 2 years in prison so get comfy.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat in my jail cell, thinking about wat i had done. And then something happened. I started to regain consciousness and was back sitting in the house. Finding out that the future thing was just a dream. Just a dream right now.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran out of the house, not looking back and found myself home. Home and safe in my bedroom. Away from temptation. Thank you God!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dont do drugs, drink alcohol, or have sex!&nbsp;Ur too young to drink, have sex, and Drugs r illegal, remember? So if u get in my situation, just leave. Dont let my dream become your reality!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (Didn't Happen to me But it Happened&nbsp;to a Friend of Mine)
