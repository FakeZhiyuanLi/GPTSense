						       AppAlarm(tm) is an application security tool that prevents unwanted processes and applications from running. Most adware and virus programs launch processes and applications without the user knowing, or even leave unwanted processes running in the background. Process Sniper detects the launch of all processes and applications and then prompts the user to determine if it is a process that should be run. Since AppAlarm(tm) loads before any other applications or services, any application can be prevented from running.   Visit     http://www.circleofone.com     to   download   the software.

						       Net has become a part of our daily life and many of us regularly visit a multitude of web sites/blogs and use several other Net services- web-based e-mail, on-line weather service and the like. A generic interface that helps us view the contents from our favourite sites without having to visit each one of them separately and that lets us access the various Net services directly from our browser would help us quite a lot. The free software, Surfpack (    http://www.surfpack.com    ), which can be used to assemble all your favourite services into a single web page, will be useful for building such an interface.       Surfpack, which comes with a ready-made web page equipped with many built in features allows you to edit the page's content (using the `Edit' option at the page header) in &quot;whatever way, form or shape you might like.'' That is, you can add/delete any number of service modules to be presented on the home page and get them displayed in any order you prefer. As the page lies on your desktop, it gets loaded very fast and you can access it anytime by loading the browser with the URL:     http://localhost:8171/    . One drawback of this software is that it works properly only with IE. As per its site (    http://www.surfpack.com/requirements.html    ), Surfpack's versions compatible with Mozilla and Opera are under development.

						       WinZip used to be the popular tool for compressing/archiving files. As it is not free now, once the evaluation period gets over, WinZip will start reminding you to register. Actually there is no need for you to suffer from such troubles as there are a few really free file compression programs (quite similar to WinZip) in place. The free `zip file manager,' ZipCentral, is one such tool that can be used to create/extract compressed file archives. For more details:     http://zipcentral.iscool.net/    .

						       VNC tools like RealVNC (     http://www.realvnc.com/     ) can be used to take full control of a remote PC over a network. But one drawback of this tool is that the process becomes slow, as a lot of data has to move from one machine to the other for transferring the desktop graphics. Instead of the complete desktop, if mouse/keyboard movements only are to be transferred, we can easily gain considerable performance advantage. This is what the VNC client, Win2VNC (    http://fredrik.hubbe.net/win2vnc.html    ) accomplishes. Install the `RealVNC' server on one machine, install the Win2VNC client on the other machine and set up the mouse movement direction, say, to the right. Once both programs are operational, whenever you want to move to the screen of the second machine (in which VNC server is running), move the mouse pointer beyond the right-edge of the current monitor- you will immediately find the mouse pointer appear on the second machine's screen. In this context, you may also check out:     http://www.deboer.gmxhome.de/    , where you can find a private version of this package.

						   Always wondered what other new things would invade the search engine world. Indeed there are many a new around and no wonder if the King  urlLink  Goolge   walks out for a googly. Several years back the concept of search engine itself gave a kick to many web surfers. With Goolge on the scene, things changed dramatically and everyone started to "Google".This article looks at various alternative search concepts that vie for the Google crown. My favorites are Mooter and Sensis.    urlLink Mooter   How it works: presents results in nodal categories designed to help your brain decide which links are relevant. Useful for: getting a fresh view on a search. Web link:  urlLink www.mooter.com    urlLink  Sensis   How it works: Location based Searching is its USP and it really works. It even displays the results in a Map format if applicable. Useful for: Quick searching with location information Web link:  urlLink http://beta.sensis.com.au/    urlLink  Grokker   How it works: uses a US$49 proprietary client to present search results as maps, displaying content in a separate window. Useful for: browsing lots of links without hitting the back and forward button dozens of times. Web link:  urlLink www.groxis.com    urlLink  Vivisimo   How it works: conventional index but presents results clustered into topics listed in a directory tree. Useful for: refining a search without ever having to read the results. Web link:  urlLink www.vivisimo.com    urlLink  Teoma   How it works: by using technology called “subject-specific popularity”. This determines the best answer for a search by asking experts within a specific subject community about who or what they believe is the best resource for that subject. Useful for: a left-field second opinion. Web link:  urlLink www.teoma.com    urlLink  Eurekster   How it works: invite your friends to join the engine, which then matches the results you all appreciate to refine results. Useful for: getting your friends’ perspectives on relevant results. Web link:  urlLink www.eurekster.com    urlLink  A9   How it works: takes Google’s results, presents them in a different interface, adds the ability to search in Amazon.com’s vast library of digitised books and tracks all past searches for the entire database of Amazon.com customers. Useful for: searching through books as well as the Web. Web link:  urlLink www.a9.com   For more information look at this article - Google Killers  urlLink http://www.apcmag.com/apc/v3.nsf/0/4380198E90F5152DCA256E9700260A18

						        You could soon be able to spice up your e-mails with your favourite perfume.       UK net provider Telewest Broadband is testing a system to let people to send aromatic e-mails over the internet. It has developed a kind of hi-tech air freshener that plugs into a PC and sprays a smell linked to the message. Telewest say it could be used by supermarkets to tempt people with the smell of fresh bread or by holiday companies seeking to stir up images of sun-kissed beaches.       &quot;This could bring an extra whiff of realism to the internet,&quot; said Chad Raube, director of internet services at Telewest Broadband.       &quot;We are always looking at ways to enhance the broadband internet experience of the future and this time we are sure consumers will come up smelling of roses.&quot;       The technology behind the idea was originally developed by US company Trisenx. Scientists at Telewest's labs in Woking, Surrey, have built on that research to come up with the idea of a &quot;scent dome&quot;.     The dome comes with a cartridge containing 20 basic aromas, which can be combined to produce up to 60 different smells.       A &quot;scented e-mail&quot; would contain electronic signals that would tell the dome to release the smell of flowers, perfume or coffee.       &quot;Our sense of smell is directly connected to our emotions,&quot; said anthropologist Kate Fox, director of the Social Issues Research Centre in Oxford.       &quot;Smells trigger very powerful and deep-seated emotional responses, and this additional element to the internet will enhance users' online experience by adding that crucial third dimension.&quot;       But the chance to sniff your e-mails not may come cheap. Telewest says its &quot;scent dome&quot; could cost around Â£250 and would only work with a high-speed, broadband connection.                               The plug-in device for the PC could cost around Â£250

						       Several useful free or shareware programs are available on the Net that can be easily downloaded. While many of the tools work well, some of them install additional programs without your permission.       The purpose of such programs can be to display advertisements along with the main tool so that the author of the software gets something in return for his work. However, some programs that get installed this way can be harmful. For example, programs called spyware silently watch your digital life, collect data about you and transmit them to its creators.       To get the latest information on such malicious tools, have a look at the site SpywareInfo (    http://www.spywareinfo.com/    ) that regularly features valuable news items and articles on the subject.

						       To read articles on famous news web sites such as    New York Times    ( http://nytimes.com ),    Los Angels Times    (    http://www.latimes.com/    ) and the like, you need to register with them.       At times, this mandatory registration requirement can be quite annoying. If you want to evade the registration process of such services, check out the site Bugmenot (    http://www.bugmenot.com/    ), created solely for this purpose.       Access the service and enter the address of the news site you want and click on the `Show Logins' button. At this point, the service will provide you a log-in name and password from its database that will work with the specified web site. The log-in details can be used for reading articles from the news site concerned.       If you want to access the service directly from your browser, you can use the `bookmarklet' provided for this purpose. FireFox users can install the Bugmenot extension (    http://bugmenot.mozdev.org/    ), which will enable them to access the service through the browser's right-click context menu.

						       Each machine on the Net has an IP address, which is a string of numbers. One way to know more about the ownership and other registration details of a machine whose IP address or domain name is known to you is to enlist the `whois' service that digs these details from the relevant database. Coolwhois (     http://www.coolwhois.com/     ) is one such service that can be used for this purpose.       But during your web journey, if you want to get the registration details of the current web page, you will have to move over to the service's site for invoking the `whois' service. Naturally, this is a little annoying and one would like to invoke the service directly from the page. You can get around this difficulty by using a bookmarklet that lets you access the whois database directly from the browser.       The bookmarklet `Whois URL' (     http://www.canufly.net/georgegg/WhoisURL/getwhois.htm     ) is one such tool. Drag this bookmarklet on to your browser toolbar and whenever you are on a page whose domain details are required, just click on it.

						       It is common knowledge that an e-mail id, which is in wide circulation, becomes more vulnerable to spam or junk mails. As regular readers of this column would recall, one solution to control this menace is to make your main e-mail address less known to the public. Actions such as publishing the address on web sites, providing it to on-line services while signing-up an account with them and the like are some of the means through which an e-mail address gets out of your hand.       One trick that will make an e-mail id less public is to use a throwaway or disposable e-mail address.       This column has already featured a few such services. The service, Mailinator (     http://www.mailinator.com     ) that helps us create instant e-mail ids and the e-mail alias service, Mailnull (     http://mailnull.com/     ), are typical examples. Here, we explore some free mail forwarding services that automatically expire after a specified period.       Spamgourmet (     http://spamgourmet.com/     ) is almost similar to `Mailnull' but with some extra features. It allows you to create several e-mail ids that can be made to disappear into the cyberspace automatically, after use for a specified number of times. To use the service, you have to provide a log-in name and an e-mail id for forwarding your mails.       Once the registration process is over, whenever you want to provide an e-mail id to a public service, you can create a self-destructing e-mail address of the form: your-service-name.n.your_    log-in-name@spamgourmet.com.     Here `n' is the number of e-mails you want to receive in this address before you want this e-mail id to die.       That is, if the name of the service you want to sign-up with is `lug', your spamgourment `user name' is `jmspam' and you want to receive 5 mails in this address, the disposable address can take the form:     lug.5.jmspam@spamgourmet.com.     Mails addressed to this id will automatically get forwarded to your real mail address and once the number of mails exceeds five, `Spamgourment' will stop forwarding the mails addressed to the disposable address.       Jetable.org (     http://www.jetable.org/en/index     ) is another disposable e-mail address service worth a trial. For your real e-mail id, the service will provide you with a disposable e-mail alias that can last for one to eight days. During the Jetable e-mail alias' lifetime, any mail addressed to it will be forwarded to your real e-mail id. To create a disposable address, enter your real e-mail id, select the new address' life span and click on the `create' button.       TrashMail (     http://trashmail.net/     ) is a `one use' disposable mail redirection address service. Here, only the first email sent to the disposable address will be forwarded to your real address. After the `first use' the address gets deleted.
