      The last show that I saw was David Bowie at The Backyad in Austin, TX.  Outstanding show, outstanding venue.  Bowie is ageless.  And he sounded great.  I recommend his new CD, "Reality".  That same night we went to the Continental Club and caught an Austin band called "Grady".  They were phenomenal.  A great accidental find.  Very Stevie Ray Vaughn-ish but harder.  Incredible guitarist/lead singer named Gordy Johnson (ex of Big Sugar) and Big Ben Richardson (played with Jeff Healey I think), and Chris Layton on drums (Double Trouble, Arc Angels).  If you are ever in the Austin area on a Tuesday night, they play the Continental at 11pm each week.  What I have tickets to so far:  Friday, 5/28...Omar & the Howlers, Casbeers  Thursday, 6/10...KISS/Poison/Dokken, Verizon Wireless Amphitheater (VWA)  Saturday, 6/12...Tesla, Sunset Station  Friday, 6/25...Rush, VWA  Saturday, 7/31...Vince Neil/Ratt/Slaughter, Sunset Station  Saturday, 8/7...OZZFEST featuring the original members of Black Sabbath as well as Judas Priest, VWA  Sunday, 8/15...Boston, Sunken Garden Theater  Wednesday, 8/18...Dave Matthews, VWA (this show will get me laid)  Tuesday, 9/28...Van Halen, SBC Center  Saturday, 11/20...Metallica, SBC Center  And more to come.

      I have wanted to start a blog for some time now.  If for no other reason than to simply express my thoughts and feelings on life and it's events both personal and otherwise.  I read a great deal on-line about world events, sports, etc.  I would assume that this will evolve as time goes by into what I need it to be...a place to vent, to debate, to laugh.  I am a grounded conservative, meaning I don't recite the party talking points on issues and tend to approach matters of politics wigth an open mind.  Having an open mind has allowed me to learn a great deal from some very interesting people with varied ideologies.  I haven't always been this way...growing up with fairly liberal parents and attending a very liberal college in the late 80's/early 90's made be think that I was a Democrat, and I voted for Bill Clinton in '92 after graduation.  As I have become older, and more mature...experiencing much more of life than I had up until '92...I have found that my true beliefs are more on the conservative side.  For example, I support the War in Iraq...a flash-point of some of the most heated political debates and opinions that I have ever seen in my lifetime.  I will vote for Dubya this November, although I, like other conservatives, am concerned about what we are faced with over there.  I have been pushed a bit more to the "right" by the behavior of the liberals and "hate-Bush" crowd that have, I believe, harmed this country in this time of war.  The momentum seems to be with these people, although I still feel Bush will beat Kerry in November.    On a lighter note...I am a big sports fan.  I played college football a long time ago and have been a season ticket holder for the San Antonio Spurs (World Champs '99, '03) since 1997.  Prior to that, my father held season tickets (and was actually one of 40 original investors in the team when the moved to San Antonio in 1973) since the beginning of the franchise when I was but a wee little man.  I also have season tickets to University of Texas football games and have been a diehard fan almost all of my life.  I am always up for sports discussions.  As for a little of my personal life...I am a mortgage broker and have enjoyed a very fruitful year and a half. Prior to that I was an executive with the world's largest producer of live entertainment.  I worked in the concerts division and spent several years opening and running a new venue in Texas.  I am blessed with wonderful friendships, a great family (mother and father deceased) and a relationship of almost 2 years which is teetering on the brink of disaster.  It will be fun to wrap about this also.  Bottom line is this is starting as an experiment, and I hope that it will evolve into something that I can be proud of.
