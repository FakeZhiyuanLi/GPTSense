      Well I phoned the hospital this morning and it seems that mum okish and being discharged this afternoon although may have to go back in on mon.  As I knew mum wasn't dead I headed of to the highland games with Paul, fantastic weather but once you have seen one huge man in a kilt throw a rock you've seen them all, so we headed into town and look round the shops and met up with Chris( supposed to be working but seems to have weekend off! look at last weekends post for info!!) and Gordon and headed up the glen to look at waterfalls/rivers etc. Though we were going to die due to chris's driving but managed to survive just.  Guys thought about jumping the waterfall but Chris took a sneaky look at his underwear and decided againt it ( he must have had his spiderman boxers on !!) so we went to the visitor centre for some drinks and went and sat down by the river for a while. Actually I quite enjoyed it. iv just been to friends house to feed her cat as she is on holiday at the mo.  I'm off out tonight with a load of friends and apparently Chris is having a party round his after. Not sure what is happening there as he has never mentioned asking me out last weekend but I'm thinking as he was supposed to be working this weekend and he's not that he may be think of something. il keep you posted. Have fun missing you all.

      I have spent most of the day in the middle of the highlands investigating a couple of possible food poisoning cases unbeknown to me that my mum was taken into hospital this morning with suspected pendisitis. when my phone did eventually get a signal(highlands crap for signal) there was a message left saying to get intouch with social service as the kids had no one else to stay with at the time and were with them .!! phoned my mums home number to find that my sister had eventually got in touch with one of mums friends and that she was looking after them and that mum was okish in hospital with food poisoning and is going to have to stay in over night. well the kids dad eventually finished work and headed over to mums to look after them until mum comes out. god what a scare!!! That's the bad thing about living so far from my family, I carnt really be their when I'm needed.  Friend Tammy is coming over tonight to cheer me up. Were going to experiment with the alcohol samples Helen sent over (much appreciated), especially at the mo.  Tomorrow I'm heading out to the highland games if I don't have to rush down to my mums that is.  god what a day !!

      This morning I spent most of my time looking up the law for the &nbsp;employment of children!! yes it does have to do with my job !! especially if there working in kitchens.  Went with Mark to do an inspection of a Indian restaurant on the high street, found another place where I will not be eating !!  Maggie if you make it here in Aug you may not get fed after all !!  Spent most of the afternoon messing around on the computer and my work e-mail( don't ask for the addy as I only use it for work stuff)  Spent a while talking to Maggie and Wolf on the MSN, it was like&nbsp;we could have been round the kitchen table at uni!! strange  I'm off to watch the TV for a while then over to see Dawn, she has keys for me so I can feed her cat and hamster when she goes on hol next week, not fair she gets the red hot sun and I get her cat !!

      Mmmm I'm 25 today not sure if this is a good thing or not ?  Any way I'm just back from my weekend away in Callander, it was great to see my family eventhough they are as mad as ever.  I got there on Friday night booked into my B&B and went in search for food, found a really good fish and chip shop and eat chips while having a wonder round town.  on Saturday while is was still eating my traditional Scottish breakfast my family turned up, mum making comments along the line of god have you only just got up !!! Well it was only 9.30 !! what does she expect !!  as it was raining (typical Scottish weather) we looked round the shops and bought various types of Scottish tablet and fudge.  we ventured along the road to Aberfyle, small village with not very much there apart from tourist shops and lovely senery, to have lunch in a woolen mill.  after that we went for a walk along to a waterfall, which was very nice.   Sunday we all went to a safari park, I actually enjoyed see the elephant, lions, zebra etc.  for tea as the weather was actually very sunny we went for a pic nic and sunbathed and I opened my presents from my family, I got a really nice jewelry box from my mum, a lovely cup from my sis, a photo album from Ryan and a starfish crystal from Chris and chocolates (vummy) from my god mother and a heart shaped necklace from my gran ( necklace bought with the money she gave me anyway )  I also got a lovely handbag with a cat on it from Alex, which will be used often!! and found chocolate in the handbag, that girl knows me well!!   looks like my love life could be picking up!! Although I'm not sure what to do about it!! remember me saying that the other weekend I fell asleep in a drunken haze on a sofa with two guys?!! at a friends house,&nbsp;well one of them(Chris) phoned me on sat to ask if I wanted to go on a date! At the time I said I would think about it, he's actually a nice guy well as guys&nbsp;go anyway and good looking and he in the RAF so I wouldn't have to see him to much but he's only 20 or 21 years old! Will have to think about it!!

      Im quite happy today as I know im off work tomorrow and Monday, this is because im meeting my family in Callender (very small Scottish village) for a long weekend to celebrate my 25th birthday.&nbsp;  Were all booked into the same B&amp;B for the weekend and as I haven't seen them for months im really looking forward to it.  Not done to much at work today, mostly computer stuff to do with filing although did have a meeting this morning with a manager and chef from a hotel to go over there HACCP stuff ie kitchen info etc etc.  Did have the best roast beef in a roll for my lunch tho, Christine would have loved it!!!  After lunch ended up going to the local hospital with Mark (EHO) for a food hygiene inspection, the kitchen was one of the cleanest iv seen since starting work here which is good, but then that is what you would expect for a hospital.  Im off out tonight to visit friend Dawn, usually consists of a good gossip and lots of coffee, I miss doing this with the girls from uni , sniff  bye for now

      I had a great weekend camping in Glencoe apart from a few midgie bites (100s)!!! We went to Oban on Saturday and had a look round and on Sat night we went to a pub in the middle of nowhere and got pissed, eventhough the pub was miles from civiliazation i still managed to meet a couple of people knew!!  Sunday got up late and chilled most of the day. Did manage to do a little study but i couldnt be bothered.  Iv been studying this morning at work tho but dont think it will help much, im looking forward to having a few days off after my exam and not have to think about anything like work or results or exams.  May not be any posts for a while as going away, so there will be not computer access. bye for now and behave!!

      Well its a beautiful day in Fort William , iv had a few good days at work, yesterday plodging around in a burn with my wellies on looking for possible sewage, thankfully didn't find any. Also went to a local restaurant to investigate a complaint to do with a dead fly in there soup( yuk)  Today went to a shellfish place to do an inspection, bit smelly but actually very interesting!! Then Maryese and I popped in to local cafe for a coffee and a piece of cake, the joys of working!! haha.  Hoping to get off early this afternoon and head of with Chris for the weekend, were planning on a spot of camping!! im having to have great faith and trust in him in the fact that he is organizing everything, including food!! god i hope he remember a tin opener!! ( well im working and he on holiday so he has more time than me). Im also praying the weather doesn't change for the worst, rain + camping in Fort William/Scotland= Midgies!!

      Well i had a good day yesterday, I was busy at work, first on a housing grant inspection, then a food hygiene inspection of a kitchen in a community center, then Robert and I went to view an area of land for a possible beer garden, beer garden much needed in Fort William but I then had to write the letter saying that if they didn't do a load of work to the land and surrounding area they wouldn't get permission to have one( didn't like writing that letter!! was nearly crying!) I want beer garden!!!  After work I went to the pictures to see Sherk with Chris and his little sister. God that is a funny film. well worth watching.  I then went back to Chris's and met his family, his mom lovely but his brothers aged 4 and 5 are absolutely mad!! Im not so worried about him meeting my family now!! although they could go mad as well!! will just have to wait and see.  He is coming next week to meet them all!! he must be mad.  Were going to stay in Glasgow for a few days while I have my re-sit. Were planning on meeting up with Maggie( looking forward to that) one night, so that should be fun. Were then going to head down to my mums, not sure for how long tho, depends how my family behave i guess, anyhow i dont have to be back at work until the following Tue.  As im at work writing this i better get on with some i guess!!  Hope you are all well

      Well i had a lovely weekend, on Saterday i got up late and had a wonder round town and then met a friend for a drink in the sun outside the pub, it makes a lovely change to be able to sit out and enjoy the weather for once.  Chris came home on the Sunday so we spent most of the day together first up the glen lounging round in the sun and when it got to hot!!(amazing yes i said to hot) we went for and ice cream and found a picnic spot under a tree in the shade for a while.  Im back at work today, been doing a little revision for my resit although im still not getting the calculations so we will just see how the exam goes, think i may have to re sit it again next semester.  the re sit exam is next week and im planning on heading down to my mums for a few days after that, im not sure if Chris is coming with me or not, it may be a bit to soon to inflict him with my family, he may meet them and decide to run a mile!!

      Iv had a good week at work and even spent some of today revising for my re - sit exam, thought id better start as its in a few week.  I had a really good day yesterday in Arisage as the weather was sunny and we had two caravan site inspections to do. The weather makes a big difference when you have to work outside.  the day before that I was in a hotel with Mark doing a kitchen inspection and the guy actually remembered me from when I was there in 1999, god we must be scary for him to remember me from so long ago!!  I'm just planning on chilling this weekend and sleeping!! Although Chris is home on Sunday so may do something.  How are you all doing ? Iv not herd from a few of you in a while!!

      Its still hot but it is grey and it looks like a thunder storm may hit any minute.  Nothing much happening really, spent some time with Chris and Dawns cat ! Watched a video which wasn't as good as i hoped it would be ( Missing) anyone else seen it?  Been out this morning with Mark to do a food hygiene inspection, it was actually a very good/clean kitchen.  I have to do filing/compilation stuff this afternoon to do with private water supplies for head office, it will keep me busy but bored no doubt.

      Well im back at work today after a good weekend, as the weather is nice iv decided to leave early, ie 4pm instead of 5.  well the gossip!! Chris and i have decided to give it a go, i spent most of sat and sunday with him and thought why not, he is very funny and good looking, we watched a video cuddled up on the sofa last night, after spending most of the day up the glen, him playing footy with his mates and me enjoying the sun getting a tan, iv know his mates for about 4 years now so its quite cool although iv only known him since last year.  im trying to ignore the fact that he is only 20, he doesn't really act as if he is but will just wait and see how things get on, getting up early for work this morning was vastly improved by a text message from him saying good morning me lovely butterfly!!! well i thought it was sweet anyhow!!! Hes off back to work tomorrow so im going over to his after work for a while. he works in Aberdeen and is in the RAF(nice uniform). Irene,Angela if your reading this you have actually met him!! he came to stay at mine at uni for the weekend before xmas. dont know if you remember him ?  better go and get some work done!!
