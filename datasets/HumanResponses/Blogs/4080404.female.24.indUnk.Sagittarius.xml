      Hahaha... i was quite into writing up and customizing the blog and smoking at the same time... was a very relaxing act for me.. that was until when i heard the keys... it was my dad... well... he didn't caught me in the act but the scent was there... heehee... anyways, he knew i was a smoker... He just acts as nothing had occurred and told me about his exams...   Hmmm... exams for dad?? Well, it was like this.. he is a security guard and his company sent him for security training course by CISCO. He had been taking this course since monday... that is when i was out of job... -.-; Anyways... he was unable to come home as he attends his course at day and works at night... basically did not see him since then...( and i was quite free to smoke around since then as i was hanging around at home jobless.... except for my elderly *oops * sis's&nbsp;disapproval face... :P )   Back to story... he was busy asking questions about the needs of me and his course and exam&nbsp;happenings... about the work stuff and colleagues planning... then, when he's about to go for work... he advise me not to do it in the house for the scent lingers&nbsp;around ....   hohoho... oh my.. thought i could get away with the lecture... but then the cigs smell was to0 obvious to be not known... lolz... Well... what he doesn't know is that the smell will always be cleared after 2 hours of good ventilation... Muahahaha... well... too bad... as he came in i just finished the cig for only a few 10 minutes... :P Glad that dad didn't stay long for i didn't want him to inhale too much of the "2nd hand" smoke.... My dad has high blood and heart aches... didn't want him to go hospital's&nbsp; ICU again.... -_-;;;   Well.. Over and Out!

      Howdy! My sister's movin out... and i thought she's kidding, but she's not. Just find it pretty wierd that she is movin' to my aunt's house... Living with my aunt is my looney cousin... I'm not kidding about the looney part...he has been in the Woodbridge hospital, a madhouse for Singaporeans. Ok... not madhouse... just a place for disturbed persons to recuperate... but then, my cousin had been swinging an axe into a shopping mall glass door a few years back which in fact hit the news. Oh well, so much for "celebrity" relatives. Wish ma'sis good luck then... Hohoho  ok, so much for gloating over her movin' out issue. Kinda missed her already. I'm not cold blooded after all... heehee... Can't help thinking about my ex's performance... was hoping everything will go well... from my guess, her skit is well done just that she must be very nervous... and she'll definately rattle on after the event on how nervous, which part she liked and which part of it she wished she had improved on.... i can just imagine the event... -.-  Ok, enough said... ah!! just remembered that the carboard my dad ordered is to be delivered on Tuesday!! And i have not even tidied up the place.. oh my... i better hurry up and tidy the place.... despite the tiredness incurred from the hiking trip! Ganbatte ne!!  Over and Out!

      Today... feeling's bad right now... my ex just asked me "have you received my message yesterday?" I said "Hmms?? Yes" After much silence i added "So?" Silence all the way... no response from her  Was trying to vent my anger... well... but my heart hurts more.. hates more... bleeding unknowingly... then i changed my nick to : wants to see the skit... dun wanna go in... cos... devils are out of bounds   Then i saw her nick : Come to the Father.. though ur gifts is small... broken hearts,broken life... He will take them all  I went insane... i thought to myself.. yeah, rite on! U are the one who broke my heart, ruin my life psychologically. I'm in pieces already... hate you... to the core... hate you more by every second... until the very day you leave THAT religion! My forgiveness is not needed by you... as you will never have cared.. all you care is for yourself... like i did... So forgiveness is not an option... what's done is done... dun hurt me more by re-appearing now and then... sorry it can't be forgotten... until the day i pass or amnesia..   Went to Bukit Timah hill with my friend. hiking was fun... we went around the hill in all possible ways... i purposely carried a heavy bag to train... but my friend "seized" the bag.... In the end... it was like she trained but not me.. hahaha~ Enjoyed the trip but the stones mixed in the "stairs" was hurting my toes and soles... Checked and saw my shoes were holed by the stones... fortunately it was only one hole in the left sole. Not deep enough to get to the base of my sole's sole... Lolz..  Was walking, jogging and jumping around the hill to get through the journey. Enjoyed so much, but returned path was blocked due to "BEEHIVES AHEAD ROAD BLOCKED". Upon seeing this dampened my mood... made me very frustrated for i was happily thinking to myself, I'm reaching!! GRRRR~~~... Saw a few squirrels on the way.. spider with magnificent network and of course! Not forgetting the locals, monkeys! heehee.. and a whole lot of 'em!! Was a fruitful hiking trip, my friend saw her lecturer on the way.. hahahz...   Exhausted when i got home... quite surprised not to see my sis at home... switched on my com and went to search for songs i promised my friend to send, friend who went hiking with moi, samantha (sam therafter)Lolz Server was loaded and got disconnected... frustrated to request song again and again .. and restarting my queue each time... lucky i tried to find different servers and finally got what i wanted.. or should i say what my friend wanted... ^^  Called sis while in irc.. 1st time... got into her voicemail... hanged up... 2nd time... she picked up.. i askd where she was.. tried to find out what time she comin back so i can calculate if i could smoke at home... she said not comin back... Shocked... why?? she didn't reply me.. Moments later after we hanged up, she was sleeping over at my aunt's house... ok.. i figured she's with my cousin. Ok... that's a start for my hatred... my cousin, christian... think my sis has been influenced by her already... ok.. go ahead, fine with me... you are not my sis any more any how... i can still act on as one... no probz  Feel so alone... until sam onlined... chatted with her and my irc friends... Next, i received a message again.. it's from a friend who i had tried to woo but rejected... she's call ruth. She asked how i'm getting on.. i told her about the interview on friday (refer below).. asked a few questions on exercise issues and wished her good night.. ok.. was feeling abit of sourness.. but.. am ready to put it off... okok.. the MTV channel's showin' a concert they organised, a chinese one, held in Taipei according to sam.. alot of singers i like and enjoyed their songs...   Okay... review of today:  Happy things :- Hiking at Bukit Timah Hill, Dining out sushi at a void deck, talking to sam, MTV's concert and my smokes. Unhappy things :- My ex, troubled friends in IRC, IRC's frequent net split, the unavailable songs, the much anticipated sam for me to find HER songs, my uncomplished crunches and jog, ruth getting on my nerve unknowingly for reminding me of her wedding.  Bottom line for today : SUCKS... unhappy things > Happy things  Over n out

      Wow!! Can't believe i went for the interview on time... set my alarm at 5.30am for the wake... WOKE UP AT 7am!!! I'm LATE!!! Interview's at 0815hrs, but i settle my things nice and steady before going out... Got on a bus, and was lucky to get a direct transfer of bus. Walked at a running pace and got there in time. How unlucky and lucky! Did not bring photocopy of my ID... told the registration lady... she said never mind... which i later realised.. of course never mind to you... it's me who is being interviewed...ShiT! As usual, i realised too late..  Proceed to the auditorium for briefing.. after 2 hours of butt-aching briefing, interviewing finally starts. Were to being called in batch of 3's. Interacted with the other female interviewees... lolz... didn't care much of what they said unless related to interview... cold and hungry i waited for the bell to ring and~ BeeeP~~~ My turn has come... knocked on the door, greeted to the interviewer.. oh.. our man on the briefing. Asked on why i wanted this job... i stammered... apologised and start over.. ok.. average performance... could not really communicate well.. oh well.. did my best... Interviewer gave me hints on next interview's content... Huh?? What?? I'm in or not?? Confused till now... my dad says high chance... answered all his questions... afterwhich went out... saw the girls again... bidded farewell briefly stating im going for breakfast on 11 something... should have been brunch... lol.. was too nervous, cold and can't be bothered about the girls wanting to get the most outta me... oh.. i'm sorry i didn't stay to share (evil grinz)  Went out...still excited.. seemed like high chance for me.. went out and called a few friends... called sam too... meeting at far east plaza bus stop... at around 1pm.. reached the place about 1250 something hrs... waited till around 2pm while i passed mp3 player to my ex-superior... whatever... met up with sam and went for lunch... Duhz... halfway through the lunch, black out occured at the level... went to watch a show we much anticipated... but.. what a disappointment... went to Isetan supermart at basement... but did not chat up with regina... did not feel like it... she's there working as cashier.. would go up to her counter normally... but not today.. hate the pants im wearing... tight fit.. urg.. But the shirt is the nicest i ever had.... i liked it so much that i Forced my friend , sharon to sell it to me... got it for $10... lol... actually i offered her $20.. but she sticked to 10... oh well... lucky me! lolz... really thanked her from my bottom of my heart.. have not repaid her and can't really repaid what she had ever done for me... Millions of gratitude.   Went to the arcade after the show.. we walked from orchard to marina square... lolz.. saved on bus fares.. lolz... on the way there in front of Takashimaya came a man... he started his conversation in query of our locality, we responded that we are locals.. thereafter he continued on to say if we are students or working.. etc... flashed us the police license and ask if we heard of paying it forward.. sam responded negatively... but i mentioned that i had heard it before.. then he quoted from a movie.. then here comes the main thing.. Introduced about the charity tickets and suddenly flashed a stack of $10 dollars.. handed us a booklet and kept on rattling... that bastard out of the blue mentioned distinguished feature of sam... sam's face turned red on the spotthinking the sun was shining on her face, that's why... sam really was pissed off at that instance... i was thinking..uh-oh... taboo was spoken of, and volcano has erupted.. for me.. he suddenly said "You don't look les to me either as we don't looked at each other in that funny way" flashed a stack of 2dollars to us emphasizing that people has donated and handed us the few loose tix as i handed him back his booklet in refusal... At that instance... i was looking at the floor as i heard his words... hatred rose inside of me and without second thoughts, handed the tix back into his fucking hands, said "No thanks." and walked off..  sam came up later as usual... At this moment, he had already offended the both of us in his attempt to sell us the tix.. Come to think of it... i think he deliberately chose us in order to spite us.. what's his problem man?? Bastard...unbalanced hormones??  We reached the arcade and told sam to see if any game is to her liking.. well.. nope.. not her.. but for me the guitar mania and drum mania was my aim... Lolz.. waited long enough for the kiddos to quit the seemingly forever game... could not perform too well but at least i got to vent the frusration... lol... in the end i was the one playing... promised sam to go back to Plaza Singapura for the arcade game she desires.. lol.. reached our destination and hell.. it was really a fun game she recommended.. oh my.. its called the cooking master.. a touch screen game, aim was to select the shown ingredients requested by customer's order for cooking.. time limited and a 8 by 6 ingredients shown.. lolz.. sort of a reflex and mind game.. nice.. then we went downstairs to the other arcade... ok.. this one was quiet for the machines are "matured" as United square.. not suited for us.. we went by a musical instruments shop.. walked by and walked back in .. had a little fun by just looking at the awesome equipments.. wow.. if only they were mine... One day.. one day they will be mine somehow. Lolz... daydreaming again.. :P  ok... then i told her i was going to bring her to a hidden arcade at the MRT.. she was impressed..lol.. ok..not quite.. found Cooking Master 2 there and played on.. lol... we had fun.. and decided to head on home.. had a few small chats.. on the brink of raaching the bus-stop.. our topic came up on DNA... she suddenly asked about it.. then as a Life science elective student, i told her about the hierachy of the cancer dna... and she suggest we go somewhere to sit and discuss as she is keen.. oh well.. told her about the stages of inheirited disease and hierachy... was finally going home.. got home.. online and sent sam her wanted songs.. and dozed off while downloading her songs... meeting her for Hiking at Bukit Timah hill.. she set 10 am in the morning at King Albert Park's MacDonald's...Think she's is going to e forever late again.. just add an hour to her fixed time and you won't have to wait aimlessly.. :P  Okay, that's my day... and one thing.. my dad finally took leave and rested at home.. thats good.. ^-^ He works too hard but well, his family depends on him.. ^^ That's all for today...Ciaoz  Over & out

Actually i know the supervisor wants to help me and by helping me, she is also able to get off days... but this has inccured the OM's wrath...   But working has been fun with all the colleagues.. really missed the days with them.. but i guess i have to leave it down. Heehee.. Have not been writing due to another reason. I have been letting it all out on the irc often. Got to know friends again. Didn't know that making friends could be this easy..

People are funny creatures.. don't know how to describe.. now am waiting for mp3 download... quite bored right now.. have to go to deliver something for my collegue later in the day... let me smoke another cig first... then i will be get going ^;^  Over And Out dude!

      Sad day today... was awakened by by father's phone call early in the morning... Complained about my sister's act again... Sighz. My sister took father's $20 and told him she has to foot the tickets to KL...What!!! She is supposed to be at work?!?!? But then... called my sis after hearing out my dad's version...So it's all miscommunication... My sister is only going to Kuala Lumpur and transfer to ferry in order to get to a resort on dunno some island... Lolz... She has mentioned this matter to me... but didn't really give a damn.. hahaha... Well.. Woke me up and worry in vain, and i was still SLEEPING!!! Why did my mornings became so disturbed!!? Can't i get some good rest?? Have been feeling down and out these few days ever since my ex contacted me.... Made me sleepless again..   As usual was on irc and msn... played abit of online game... but was frustrated with the irc girl, Jaslyn... She was acting funny... even suspected that "She"s a fake gal... suspicion have been rose to 80%. Getting ready to "discard" this friend... Hatred for people who lies to me...  I am a person who some what into horoscopes... scorpio is the inner self of the taurus and vice versa. My ex was a scorpio, the girl i was after is taurus... let's just call her jas. Jas rejected me because of her religion TOO!!! In that case... don't accept me in the 1st place BITCH! And coincidentaly, this Jaslyn is also a taurus... was also a christian.. I have developed an enormous hatred for christians. Don't mention any word on christian or i will "fight" till the end.. I get agitated everytime people mentioned anything related... once they start... either i avoid... or i break out and ramble on... Even thought out a phrase for which i like very much to the core! It goes like this " Jesus Child, Touch Me Not, Or You Shall Burn With ME!!!!" Lolz... Liked it alot... Sounds so anti-christ... but heck, who tell them to put me in this state.. Fuck it.   Yes yes, you may say i should not hate.. but love... But HEY! I loved them too much !! So I hate them THIS MUCH! OKAY? So be gone if you don't like what i had expressed. It's MY BLOG anyway.  It all started with love and ended in hatred. If this is a fact for me, then i shall not love again. I will rather burn myself in hell than love again. All this is shit. Why do i have so much agony to express today? It's all because the show in the afternoon... The Girl broke up with the guy... okay, guy was willing to let go and used all ways to persuade and coax himself that he will get over.. But he did not.. and end up in exceptionally miserable state... lost all interest in work.. but still has to work... He is a creative director but lost all his creative. Nothing can perk him up except this girl... for whenever he shuts his eyes, he sees her. Finally he went to this girl's house and stood outside at the darkened house in the middle of the night. He rang her up... hoping she would be home.. She picked up "Hello? Hello?",the guy did not speak and hanged up for she was not at home and her house still darkened... gusts of wind was blowing towards the guy.. on the verge of leaving, the guy tried once more and the same greeting came... this time it came from his back.. the girl's home looking at him.. They went on to the bench where they had spent time with.. the guy expressed how he had tried and coax himself, the sleepless nights he has despite the tiredness he has, the drinks he had in the bar which he said to be for him to get drunk enuff to sleep.. in the end , it all sums up to the reality, he loves her, but has to let go for she left for another guy. No words can bring her back to him... He was indeed sad and so out of love.   Because of this show, i was crying like i just broke up with her. Made me eye so swollen... lost all my happiness  i had tried to developed to cover the sadness in me. I am so weak.. I hate myself.. anyways.. will be okay after i wake up tommorrow. Hope.   Planning to get a web cam and my interview shoes tommorrow. The cheque had better go through by today.. So i can be reliefed of all my worries.. gotta calculate my bills and expenses tommorrow in order to get my budget on web cam.. am very tired now.. but was not able to get myself in bed... just like the guy... why remind me when i'm about to forget.... Why..  I'm so tired.. will be hanging out the clothes later and see if i can get to smoke... love to smoke at night... .. am so tired... over ... &.... out.... -_-Zzz

      Hohoho, my day has been an unfruitful one and meaningless... was awakened by Mr. Kent early in the moring 10 o'clock. He called just to ask me for his work...I wonder... What has his work questions gotta do with me... oh well... I'm not that knowledgeable you know... guess he still don't understand that... Asked me how to get the Ohms reading of a transducer... What the heck... Even forgoten what the hell is a transducer... Finally got up and checked it out on the web... It's a sort of sensoring device that converts one signal to another... Meaning if its for measuring temperature, it converts the temperature (Degree Celsius) to electrical units (volts or amperes).. But in his case, he is measuring the resistance??? What?? Make me so messed up for the rest of the day..  Attended to my Tamagotchi just now.. The Matchmaker finally came and guess what?? My pets mating partner is what i have long wanted : The Ninja. Waahhaah... Got a boy for mating wif the ninja (his name is Lonely according to matchmaker).. It's on its way to Generation 3... This version of tamagotchi is the second. It's main feature is you can interact with other tama's by using the infra-red on top. You can make friends and your pet can have many friends~~ In addition, your pet can develop relationships with the pet friends made, be it love or friendships. It has a frienship list for you to keep track and gifts~~ from your pet friends.  Enough for the tamagotchi thingy.. feel so bored abt it...sians... I will be planning to play my online game Monster and Me later in the day... as usual, will be cooking dinner for sis... Hahaha... the usual rice and soup again.. :P too lazy to go out and buy ingredients for dinner.. Anyways.. Vegetarians doesn't have much variety anyways... (psst.. i'm smoking while typing) hahaa~~ Hope won't get caught this time...   Ah yes, went to renewed my library books online just now... that is while i searched for the transducer thingy... Or maybe i can do out the clothes later and carry on my self-learning programme on Visual Basics... That's what i borrowed from the library... Now am chatting with my ex-school mate cum friend, Jasmine Foo.. She is working in the sports council as a clerk if i remember correctly that is.. She is bored at work and decided to msn me.. herher...  Weather has been wet since yesterday.. rainning and stopped and rained again in the middle of the night when i'm still awake...   That's about 2.30 am in the morning...  Was feeling funny again..  What i had found out about myself... whenever i'm in contact with my ex gf, i would have sleepless nights and mild heart problems.. i would be slightly depressed and feel awkward the whole day/s .. especially when i see her blog... sigh.. think to prevent me from going into depression again, i will have to let go and interact with her less... it's for my own good and not for her benefits... Hate her religion... cos that's one of the reasons she gave me when parting... I had attitude problems towards her on that fateful day tooo... but it was inevitable... cos i really loved her that much.. put everything in and left with nothing.. Have no regrets though... For i ever asked myself and confirmed that i truly had put 100% into the relationship... I hate her alot for i loved her so much... Which i hope would be over soon... or i would go into the depression state i'm in after the breakup.  Have alot of thoughts about the relationship. Found out that i was in fact not a verbal person.. can only expressed myself through other means.. like music, online chats... For what i see, i am only good in typing out my thoughts but not verbally.. For i still stand on my opinion that : What good is to tell others when they can't be of much help, for problems of my own can only be solved by myself...   Yes it's true that even of no help in telling, it sure is good to let it out then bottled up. So i will only let it out on strangers in the chat room of my own kind than to voice it out to my friends, for they have their own problems.. I'm selfish i know, but i care too much for me and my friends that i will only trouble the outsiders... hahaha (*Devilish grin) Ahhhh~~ feel so much better in pouring it out on the Blog.. funny~ still don't really know how it works... heehee...  (hums)Oh my darling~ oh my darling~ oh my darling clementine~~~ (Hee~he~) Feel so texas...in the wild wild west~~~~ Hohoho~ Over And Out~~!!  *Note: I burnt a hole in the plastic bag after flicking the ciggy in it... sigh.. glad i did not start a fire... Although there was a funny smell... Ewww~~
