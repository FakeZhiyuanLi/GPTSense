      I hate shopping for clothes when you know you need them, but also know that you have gained a bit of weight since setteling down and want to lose a good 20 lbs. My hunt: Plain simple black pants for work, easy no?? NO!! I went to 15 differnt stores and tried on every stupid pair I saw, (expensive or not) and got more and more depressed as this charade wore on. With sales people screaming, "Can I help you??", "Oh, what's wrong they didn't fit??", "Did you not like them?", with fake smiles and stupid faces, AARRRGGHHHHHH !!! As I walked away I felt like eating a big tub or french fries floating in vinigar to drown away my pain. Instead, I had a mint.

      It been an amasing journey. Life, i'm talking about. Have you ever thought about where you we're, where you are and where you want to be...it's almost life thereatining if you think about this too much because life will take it's due course weather you want it to or not. I once thought I can make life do whatever I wanted it to. Once I finally got off my high horse and realised that life will do what it wants to and you can only stall whats bound to happen or veer it one way or another, life took on a whole new meaning for me. For example: Love, I only found the one I love recently and it is sooo hard. To know that your morals are different, your interests are different, and quite possibly your lifetime goals are different is tough, especially when you think you could, quite possibly, want to spend the rest of your life with this person. How are you to figure if there will be conflict later when all the signs point to yes and you've spent your life trying, and quite succesfully I might add, avoiding conflict all together. Is dirct conflict a part of life? Because I quite firmly believe (such as I did in "directing life") that conflict can be avoided all together, if dealing with the right person. Am I making any sense? Probably not. Anyways, I believe I've quite said enough. I am a private person and already feel uncomfortable with what i've said thus far. Goodnight...xoxo  I never realized how liberating writing on some site, that possibly, but probably never will be viewed...lets go of all the things you've bottled up inside but we're never able to tell anyone you we're really close to. Can I actually let myself let go on this thing??? Blogger.com, who'd a thunk it.

      What the hell is this all about !?!?!  O.k., my friend blogs all the time. Interesting I must say, but I'm not quite sure I can get into it. Sharing my thoughts and complaints on the internet, I dunno might as well just say them, no?  FINE...you twisted my rubber arm. Tee hee, my two friends and I are going to this retro 80's party tonight and we went to Village des Valeurs and bought thiese unbelieveable FROCKS!!! Get this, mine's metallic purple with a big purple bow and a black velvet bodice with tassles, yes ladies and gentelmen, you heard right Tassles!!! Man it's gonna be hilarious.
