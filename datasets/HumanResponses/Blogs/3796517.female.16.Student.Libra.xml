      All right day. Did nothing until 7pm. Rode bikes with Niko and got some pizza. Marty met up with us around Fairway. Niko went home and Marty stayed at my house for a couple of hours. Work tommorow. Maybe the beach before work.

      Fuck work. I hate it. I really don't mind working. I sacrafice so many nights of my young life so I can get money. The pay is crap but money is money and   money rules all  . It's the people that ruin work for me. Fuck them. I put in an application at Jillians today. It looks almost as good as Adventure Land. Adventure Land has had my application on record since they started hiring. Bastards.  So the good for today. I went shopping with mommy! It was fun. I saw Kevin at Kohls. Got a couple of nice shirts. I got to drive home. :)  Drivers Ed starts Tuesday. Two days until July 4th.

      Today was great. Went driving until 5:00 and then met with Katie and Danny at Jillians at 6:00. Jillians still sucks. They made me take off my hat too :( We walked to UA to see the terminal but it was sold out and the next show was too late so we decided on Troy. Danny left, me and Katie got Chinese food and went back to UA to wait a couple of hours. Niko George Joanie and Chris showed up and Cassandra a little later. Danny came back, we played hacky sack and saw Troy. If you havent seen Troy, go see it. It's an amazing movie. I can't find one bad thing to say about it. Drove Katie home, and now I'm going to watch the last couple of minutes of Edward Scissor Hands. July 4th tommorow... Good reason to celebrate... :-D

      It's amazing how badly people can damage other people. Today was the first day of Drivers Ed. Wasn't as bad as I expected. The lecture was just about how the engine works, It was boring. Our lecturer was all right, he teaches or is a Dean somewhere in Jamacia Queens. The driving teacher was nice, I'm in a car with Mike and Luke I think there names are, and Sal. Everyone except for me drove like an old person. It's from 8:30 AM to 11:45 AM. After that I smoked for a couple of hours and then went to the plaza and came home at 9:30 PM. Exciting day.

      Went to the SLM show at the Downtown tonight. Yea, waiting for SLM to finally get everything together was worth it because they were amazing. I got a BOTAR shirt that has a nice guitar with wings on it and... A Streetlight Manifesto poster. Its kind of tiny but I don't love it any less. I got an ASOB CD also. After all this time of me being at shows they played at I finally got one.  The bands...  I felt bad for the first bad. They wanted to be good but didnt want to be good bad enough... They were called the Malibu Boyscouts or something along the lines of that. Really off with their playing. The vocalist kept missing the mic a good portion of the time too.  High School Football Heroes. I'm not a fan of these guys. I've seen them a couple of times live I just dont like them.  ASOB wasn't as good as usuall. It was obvious they were just playing just to play. They did do a crappy cover of a Taking Back Sunday song... I forget the name.  Big D. Just like last time I saw them, they really gave me a shock. new how to communicate with the crowd... Not just talk to the crowd as a whole but to everyone. Played Dirt Lip and a couple others. Can't wait to see them again.  STREETLIGHT MANIFESTO!!! Everything I dreamed of(everynight since I found out they were playing) and more! They played A Moment of Silence, A Moment of Violence, Everything Went Numb, A Better Place A Better Time, Point-Counterpoint, Failing Flailing, The Big Sleep and a couple of others. Only band I went into the pit for. These guys come second on the best show I've ever seen, headed by Catch 22 of course.  I didn't know that anyone was going to the show. I figured I would go there and be alone but I saw Erika and Jamie and I met Rob so I had people to hang out with. Erika and Jamie left towards the end of Streetlight Manifesto and I have no idea where Rob went, but when I left the Downtown Erika and Jamie were outside. Dad called and he was a wee bit angry. Oh well, It was worth not following his bull shit curfew that I don't follow anyway so I could stay for the last song... Drivers Ed. Tommorow. Should be fun.

      Today... Drivers Education was uneventful. We did learn that "you can't just have sex with a person and then not have anything to talk about after its done!" Thanks Mr. Blankensfeld(spelling??)... Driving was okay. Bob made me drive first. I hate driving first. I drove for a what seemed like a half hour, then Sal drove for a while too. I think the other kids name is Luke. He drove for 10 minutes and we realized we have 10 minutes left and one driver left so he told Bob and Bob made Mike(not sure, the name just popped into my head) drive back to school.  The day slowly progressed....  Went to the movies with Eric! I found a ciggy on the floor. Sadly it was a Newport but it doesn't matter, it was good. Cassandra came later on. The Eric from the lunch hacky sack group was there. So was Mike Bianca. We all hacked and i had my ciggy, saw the movie, hacked some more and now im home! Spidey Man 2 was great. Go see it.

      Ahhhh I'm an asshole!!! I get myself so angry sometimes... I've been conquered. Touche Pathmark. I push around carts while listening to my iPod for... $7.00 an hour! Thats amazing!!! Everywhere else said they would give me $5.75 to $6.50. It was amazing. I can't wait, I start Monday. One day of freedom left, I still don't know how I'm going to spend it.  Across the street from Pathmark is the Minivan Man... I'M GETTING A JEEP WRANGLER!!!!    ")>   I can't wait...   82 days until I can drive!!!   The rest of my day... Went swimming and then went to Adventureland with Cassandra and her friend I forgot what his name is. It was fun. The rides were fun. I saw Eric and Steve, Dan got us in for free. Long day, I'm tired so I'll try to go to sleep. I doubt it will work thoguh.

      So I got to bed at 3:30 AM this morning. Woke up at 7:00AM for Drivers Education. We had to watch a video... I'm starting to wonder if Drivers Ed is worth it. Bob yells at me for the most meaningless things and the classroom is completely wastless. We did drive past Katies house though. So Drivers ED sucked, except for driving past Katies.   First day of work! I've been conquered by Pathmark... Kind of sad but I'm making good money here. The only thing thats bad about it is I had to join a Union. That pissed me off, Pathmark consists of Communists. The Union has one benifit though... I   CANNOT   get fired unless I do something like steal, which I won't. I am getting $7.00 an hour for pushing shopping carts to the front of the store while listening to music or talking on the phone. I love it. I got Taco Bell for lunch. Peter might be getting a job. He doesn't care about joining the Union, I don't think he realizes that means Union dues and other shit which means...   money out of paycheck!!   I got home and relaxed. I think I'm sick so I'm just going to take it easy. Before I forget.................... I'm meeting the stalker tommorow at 7:00PM at the Downtown. I can't wait to end this whole thing. Crazy stalker bitch!! >:O
