       Heyy. Ü Today we were supposed to go to the movies? I don't know. Umm, Gabby didn't call me back about that so instead, I went bowling with Momo. I have volleyball practice at 5 which is kind of an hour from now. Umm, varsity tryouts are thursday and friday... Which is tomorrow and the day after. I don't think I'll make it, but at least the head coach will notice me. I think I can make jv... Who knows.

       Yay is that I got my backpack! It came in the mail yesterday, but I forgot to tell everyone! Hahaha.  Umm, eh is uh eh. It turns out Tiff is coming to the party thing on sunday. I think it was more of a forced invite type thing, but I don't know. I don't really want to go to the party on sunday anymore. I know I won't have a good time... It's like I either show up and be mean and rude and cranky or I don't show up and people will just be like, "Aww, she didn't want to come," and still be happy. No one will be happy when I'm mean and rude and cranky.  I just don't really want to see Tiff right now. Or well, it's not that... It's just that all you guy have issues with her, but I know most of you will all act like nothing is wrong when you see her. I would too if I was one of you, but it just like, sucks. I want to have a good time, but can I do that while anticipating that I won't?

       Umm, I called Tiff back like she told me to. I called her after camp while I was waiting for my bus. She said I misunderstood half of what I thought I understood before... But seriously, I don't give a shit! It's the way she  treated  me and she still doesn't get it.  I told her about how poory she treated me all through 8th and then her "excuse" was that I treated her the same way in 6th and 7th. The only thing I don't get is, WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T SHE TELL ME??  I told her that by telling me that, she was being a hypocrit because she didn't like when I mistreated her in 6th and 7th, but then she's doing it to me in 8th! You get what I mean?? Then she started saying that I was being a hypocrit because I did that to her in 6th and 7th and then I'm complaining about it in 8th!  But what the fuck?? If she told me about it in 6th and 7th, I would stop and I obviously wouldn't be complaining about it in 8th. So really, I'm not a hypocrit because I had no clue I was doing that in 6th and 7th and obviously no one else knew either. She should have said something, like I did, so that things could get cleared up. Instead she kept quiet and then used it as an excuse.  She wanted to start over, so I agreed. I told her I wasn't her best friend, and being friends would be fine. Then get this, SHE WANTED ME TO MEET HER AT MITCHELL!! I mean come on, after we argued and shit?! It's like HELLOOOO! It's also like she doesn't get it! It's like she'll NEVER get it! I told my cousin, CJ, and Momo about it and they said that it's a possibility that she knows I'm right and just doesn't want to admit it and that's why she's so not-understanding.   God, it ruined my morning, but after I met up with Momo, things got wayyyy better.

       Ok as a few of you know, Tiff is moving into her new house tomorrow and was planning a party "with Momo" and I happened to be the last person "invited." Since Momo is such a great person and really cares for her friends, she told me about what happened with Tiff on the phone right before she was supposed to meet me at midtown. Tiff named everyone, even people she doesn't talk to, except me until the VERY end when she said in a low voice, "Uh, what about shLey?" Yup.

Click the pic to see my whole face and blah while I'm standing in the bathroom hahaha. My dad got me Crest Night Effect! Yay! Hahaha, I want pearly whites soooo badly.    Damn dad. I'm sorry guys. I ccouldn't go bowling today. My dad didn't want to drive home to get my free pass and then drive to the alley. And he didn't let me bike with Momo and Nini because he didn't think I should have committed to that time that they left because him and I probably wouldn't have been back by then. We were stuck at the stupid Honda Service Center. God damn.

        it was like 9:15 and i hear this faint buzz/ beep and so i go into my back yard and i was like omg how can i not know that horrible sound?!?! we had to hear if for all of four period one day this past yea and all JLS 7th and 8th grades should be used to it... im talkin bout the fire alarm!!! god that this is annoying! but the jordan fire alarms were goin off and since i live so close i can hear it and i was thinkin "i wonder if its really on fire, i wanna go see" then like 10 minutes later i hear a fire truck outside, but i was to lazy to open my curtains to check if it was going towards jordan. whatever... i really hope that i dont have to listen to that fire alarm much... we have all had enough of those things!

       Ahhh! Sorry for confusing everyone about this blog thingy! This blog is basically the same as the join xanga we have... xanga.com/randomly_abusive_squirrels. The only thing about this one is, is that each of us have our own account, but can still write in the same blog thingy, and you can customize your posts more [There's even spell check!]. Hahaha, I thought it was really cool so I made one for the crew. I don't know if you guys want to use this or the xanga or whatever, but it's here if you want to. Ü If you give me some people's email addresses, I can invite them. But, so far, this blog is only Maggie, Erica, Lior, Momo, and I.
