      If there's one person I would love to meet at some point of my life, it would be the individual by the name of Eddie Vedder. Because I could relate to everything he ever sang and spoke. Kurt left earlier, but Eddie hung on tightly. Both of them were like spiritual brothers, sharing a light amongst millions in the world, including me. Vedder, I believed in everything he said. Because I saw him as a real human being, together with Kurt. They showed me that somewhere in this world, there was some goodness left of it. In my youth, where I was ceasing to exist, but somehow, I still hung on. I don't ever want to go back those days, because they are gone forever, and hopefully for good. All along, something has been there but I just didn't see it. I had to take long walks, long searches, before I finally found it. In that was Music. And I thank Eddie forever for the inspiration he gave me, never made me felt I was alone, for I somehow pulled through...and needn't end up like Jeremy....

      Nothing just works out for me anymore. God, I've tried hard. I've tried to see reason, I've tried everything all for the better. But where do I end up? Back at where I was in the first place! I've resigned to the fate that nobody will ever, truly understand me. I've had turmoilous relationships with people all my life. And after all, I'm the one always ending up in the deadspot. Not that it matters anymore, for yesterday's gone forever and can't be returned. Regrets are all that I have, and it'll probably linger through the rest of my life with me. Please, try to understand. I'm not that perfect. I'm vulnerable and I hurt too. I'm not that monster you make me out to be. I act the way I am because I can never have have a clear mind to think from. Everything eats up on me, pile up and I just explode! You really think I want to be like this? You expect me to see the beauty & goodness of all creation, while my tormented life shows me none of this. Why can't I see? Its like I have a blind man's view. Deep down inside, I too want to have it all good. I want everybody to feel good too. When I have to die away one day, I rather die away peacefully than die a broken man. This is all I can say. To hear, listen to the cries of the wind. To see, the walls I sit inbetween. To feel, my soul within.

      I don't know why, but I'm always having some kind of weird dreams. I could have right up to 5 dreams a night! No joke! As a result, my sleep is always deprived.          Like yesterday, I dreamt I heard some noise outside my house. Sounded like new people moving in next door. So I creeped up to my door, took a peep outside but couldn't see the faces clearly. So I opened the door, and to my dismay, LED ZEPPELIN had moved next door to me! Unbelievable as it may sound, it was like so real to me. I remember heading outside and greeting those guys. Can't quite recall what we were talking about but I do recall afterwards, running back into my house, and calling out to Jimmy Page screaming "I COULD PLAY MUCH BETTER THAN YOU DO!". He just looked at me and smiled.          Sure it would be much much more awesome to have gone to a Led Zeppelin concert, but hey, don't think that many people can actually boast of meeting Led Zeppelin in their dreams!

      I roam the streets at night, with a painted face for my delight, I choose no path at all, I just go down the blind man's way....attracted to curiuosity, I come to the land of the needless & helpless.  Looking around, I see nothing but the souls of clowns....making merry, rejoicing with wine and cherry. I took a spot amongst the crowd, watching as children running around the black circle of fire, where the whithered woman in white dances in a provocative motion, to her onlooking child-like audience. Strangely, the looks on their faces seem drift into faceless expressions.      And so, I head off to the roads, not knowing next where I go. Been down this path so many times, I never know what's in store for me, I never want to know, cos life's a fun imagery, who knows what'll happen? Just take the trip and burn out when you want to. No need for an explantion, no need for any relation, don't need to see which side the coin flips to. Why look for something that is not even there? Why even bother? There're all gonna fade away someday, where this world will find pleasure in its pain, you know there's nothing more you can seperate.  And so, wherever I may roam, so long the winds of change blows...

      Our long lost treasure capital of desire sitting by the sidewalk of the moon her soul purifies the colorful doom  New birth takes place hours past by Satan's bed the snake bites for no tomorrow tomorrow was gone for good  Keep the cradle at bay or the babies might never awake looks like a stone's throw from here smell of the crow's fear  Shivers run down my spine and fulfillment you drank as wine free of breadth, lost hope a grave that never grows old

      I can drown forever in your seas bring you up into my tree the nectar spilled, I'm speaking nothing so speak something for me  You were in the middle of my beginnings keping me away from everything you knew would hurt the mother calling out for her lost child in the dark in the dark it was waiting to happen  I'm coming back to you one day on that day the sun will lift its gloom the stars we'll bring down to us nothing can ever seperate us again  10 years....will wait whatever it takes 20 years....still wait....

                 What happened to rock & roll as a sense of anger, rebellion, culture killing, passionate, idealist's heaven? Where a man could lay his heart on the sleeve so the whole world can listen not with grief, but with admiration and respect of the worthy, talented individual. Because today it has all gone soft. Phoney. What you see ain't what you get. What you see is what someone's hiding, what someone's hiding is not even there at all. They all jump on bandwagons, trends, where all the green lights are, just so they could fit in some place. Honesty seems more and more like a lost cause.                        I looked to rock as an escape, as heaven my past dead heroes had given me. Its now time to give back, shall I say. Rock stars? Leave that to the imposters. Because, true musical Rock heroes are born!

               Staring out of the windows, the ledges seemed to have grown inches old. The paws of a white lion holds the key to its light, what makes a hole so deep one could take delight and indulge in mindless fantasies and imagery that sparks a whole new world that struggles to be free from limits that its bound to, like crawling as far as one can from arms that surround you, the desire to never stop desiring, and pain that ever so often comes in vain....                  Making up stories so future generations can feed on, drift into blackholes where they've entangled themselves, should this world seek its end, why should anyone live? Let you all die, and do away with history.

      Is life nothing but a constant struggle? A struggle against its self? What purpose does it serve? Or does it purposely serve? Are we living in questionable times, havent many others before us asked the same questions? What if there are no questions, no answers, no right, no wrong, no sin, no trace of even an emotion. Is the loss of feeling and desire the great victory of all mankind can ever get? What if you won, only to lose it all later? Here when I speak of one's own struggle, does it mean I dictate? What if I woke up tomorrow and realized that everything was all but only a dream? Like I once heard, there is a dream inside every dream, a world within a its relative world. Seems more like some kind of black & white movie I've seen countless times before.

      This is a song by Firehouse, titled 'Love don't care'. I love this particular track because it's about breaking out of tradition, it's about loving who you wanna love without anybody telling you to do or not to. It's your life, your choice, your love...to live for. This is exactly how the way I feel about these things. Remember, it's your life to live for, not anybody else.  &nbsp; Little girl, face all black and blue But she knows better That's not the way a man should treat you But that's ok, she'll change her life tonight She's leaving him For a woman who will treat her right And everybody needs somebody She could be with anybody Doesn't matter if it's not another man  Because love don't care who you love I said love don't care who you love If you ain't hurting anybody And if you feel it deep inside Then love don't care who you love Don't care who you love  Little girl, she's no sister, she is white But she loves a brother Takin' him home to meet her folks tonight Mom and dad don't understand We're all the same inside They just don't realize That love is always colorblind  And everybody needs somebody You can be with anybody It's not the color that makes the man  Because love don't care who you love I said love don't care who you love Don't let anybody tell you That it's wrong if it feels right Cos love don't care who you love Love don't care at all  And everybody needs somebody You can be with anybody So love someone who makes you happy

      You know, you can keep quiet for so long, but one day it'll all&nbsp;have to come out. Because I don't have the strength anymore&nbsp;to quietly stomach it all. There are holes in my heart.&nbsp;I've been through hell over and over again all my fucking life. And I ain' t pleased with that. But forget it, those are just my personal struggles. Troubles that can never ever go away. It's fustrating to sit there with some fucking smile on my face, pretending everything's all right when inside I'm broken. Have you seen the way a piece of glass shatters into many pieces when it slips off your hands? That's just like my heart. I can never clearly articulate why I feel things the way they do, which is why I'm not like most people. When I'm depressed, I still manage to disguise my sorrow and pretend everything's all right. Well, everything's not! Not quite the way it seems. But me...what can I do? I just sit back and hope it all goes away and never come back. Which dosen't happen too often. If so, it's only illusion. Some things are real,&nbsp;and some are so real they're actually an illusion in disguise.&nbsp;Believe me. I learnt the hard way.&nbsp;So I turn to music for solace. It's the only place I feel in control of myself where other aspects of my life often reduces me beyond my control. I let the pieces flow..like they flowed directly from my heart. I can honestly relate to alot of guitar solos, like I could almost feel their souls. Look, I know I'm just a dot in this world, but it seems like I'm asking too much. I want to be free. I want to set my soul free. I want to soar as high as the birds in the sky, flying freely like nothing else matters, like a freedom that of a religion, avoiding the dark skies like spiderwebs that caves you in, but ah, it's all only real in the storybooks. Which is my damned reality! My foregone conclusion, my only tasteless, bland soup, my soul feeding off itself. I&nbsp;may never make it out of the pits.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Step with me into the forbidden a final act of obedience where you don't need to see any sunlight they've faded away from you  All these years all they ever taught you leaves you longing more for an excuse now you're lost in dark storms and becomes that of a favorite haunt  From afar, the palace lights shine bright but in darkness only do you regain sight from here you'll write the rest of your story like many others who did before you  Where the roses grow without it's thorns where the geese sing their golden songs where all gates are locked and never opened again where fate will never break us again

      To save yourself from a dark fate, you have to remove yourself from dark places. But at times, when this happens a little too late, the darkness leaves with you. It visits you not just in your worst moments, but also in good times where it dims all the lights those occasions have to offer. In other words, it is telling you that this is who you are, this is where you come from, and no matter how far you try to run or hide, the darkness will sooner or later come to claim you.

      You know...there's so much I want to write, but I just don't know where to start from....sitting here...wrecking my brains for something to say... You know its weird, when I'm out with a friend or by myself...there's always a moment where I lose all touch of reality. It becomes as if I'm not even there. Its like I'm sitting up somewhere, amongst some kind of serenity, where I'm watching everything taking place. Like a moment of observance I like to call it. Everything comes to a standstill. See the many faces walk past me, see all the events unfolding before me, though somehow I feel it all so unreal. Like poison that's too sweet to be lethal. Like somebody's cry you hear as laughter. I feel everybody is hiding something inside, like they're starved of their needs, exhausted by everything. I wish I could take pictures, so I could go home and study or something....

      Looks like a lost world out there but for you and me, we're safe right here cherished most in a endless despair nobody left to even care  I have seen the consequences that trails back into childhood to piece up a world of broken pieces now I've become the horror of Hollywood  And so, down all the way I go down to where I never know where my foot's the first to set ground and destination's not a question  In the cold, grey air of winter eyes were burning like summer a strange feeling fuels my desire but I wait on like the loving liar

      There's a day to come in time, in this open book of my life, that I'm still living for, my dreams that I make my destiny, to show the world all that I have in me, by God's grace, I take one giant leap. I'm going to be a rock superstar one day. I'm going to strive to change the world and its ways. With my power and influence, I'm going to make both ends of the world meet. Deny me and you shall live to regret your very deed. Payback is in my very need, your soul I've come to bleed. For the words of Destiny has it written in me, I've seen it all before me. God knows I don't want to live forever, but its now or never! Time to put the wrong things right!

          I know this comes a little late, but I need to put my thoughts down to it. The news came some time back that Creed had broken up. I was utterly devestated. My mind immediately raced back to that one single album, that goes by the title, "my own prison".     The reason why I'm so attached to that album is because I felt like it was a "document" of my life. So personal it was, I felt a bounding closeness to it. Still remembering the days when I used to go home and lay on my bed for hours, playing those songs the whole time. It was almost surreal, like everything in those moments came to a standstill. Like some timeless epic. About the band breaking up, as a fan I have my disappointments, but I've come to accept that since things have come to be such, well, so be it. There's just so much stuff going on I just feel like I don't have the strength to digest it all.     But whatever may happen, what that comes and what that goes, let it all be. Just will let it all be. Cos when I go home later and put the cd into my radio, the music that soothes my soul, in that timeless moment I'll just let my belonging fade.....

      Sometimes, when I write, I just don't know where to start from. It's like as if I'm back where I was before, and I just refuse to accept the situation before me. Like maybe it all didn't happen. I don't know, it's just things don't seem so real to me anymore. I need to bind out, find a whale in the open seas to ride off with far away, never looking back. There's deepness in all of us, some so deep, we get lost and just don't know how to escape. How much we've given up to find, only to find nothing at all. It's a struggle to grow up, as I know from my past. I don't talk about it, I want to forget it all and move on. Because when I look outside the windows, I like the wind to take me away with it, no matter where the destination is. Staying here in my little habitat, reminds me of too much sordid memories. My life as it is, nothing special. The same story goes on everyday elsewhere in the world. Love today, die tomorrow. I'm tired of asking questions, I'm simply bowing out gracefully. One last act done for myself, at least. I have arrived at the Cemetry Gates. I'm not turning back. I would like to bade out on these last few words. Nothing lasts forever. You & I are just like the wind. Blows today, may never blow tomorrow. Let love, peace, empathy, affection, compassion and grace fill our hearts, our definitive moment, because most beautiful is the ugliness of an animal. I may be an estranged, enigmatic individual, but I've lost out more than I will ever regain. I don't want to re-live the whole sentencing again. Let rock & roll stories live on in the black &amp; white, as if we're all born to die. But the search ends today, and today is the day I fade away. Farewell!

      When life dealt me with cruel blows, at those times when I thought I found bliss in my life, I was dragged into struggles with my own existence. I thought again and again why it should be me. Why should I live through all this? What did I even do to deserve all this? WHY? Simple questions, hard to find answers. These aren't answers you could find in the textbooks. Sometimes, you learn through the lessons in life. Learn the hard way. I guess for some, that's the path that Fate carrys them into. Life is never a bed of roses, Life is a bed of pricking thorns! The roses bring sweetness....but the pain brought by the thorns outshadows everything else. In other words, LIFE IS PAIN! Imagine all the pain Jesus Christ went through, I can see His strength in His suffering, and ultimately He found a heaven that's been waiting in the wings. I now truly believe things do happen for a reason, though I may never find out why.

      Yesterday's performance at Zombie was awesome. I've never heard any other band sound this powerful ever, live. There was a real sense of raw emotion, I could see in the man's eyes. Fuck, wished I hadn't left earlier. Let people think what they want about local bands. But believe me, you're more likely to find true talent out there in the hearts of the streets than some fake carbon copy talent show. Do it the grassroots style. It's hard work, but well worth it than taking the easy way out. That's at least one lesson we can learn in life. Think about it. For instance, if we wanted to keep the world's population intact, we might as well stop having babies and just rely on cloning ourselfs. That would save many women all the trouble of going through labour. But...what joy is there without some pain? To me, birth is like art. It's like a gift, an appreciation of life. Like the old saying goes, only a mother who has carried her child for 8 months, knows her child inside better than even itself. These things simply fasinate me. Life that begins from birth, the gift of crystal purity life, like a child born in the golden light, appreciation, joy, laughter. Once upon a time, I was a child too. I too was happy then. Well, at least. Something I can't be much these days.

      When I look at the long, hard road that's ahead of me, I think of how far I've come. That makes me look back at alot of stuff. Stuff I haven't dealt with years, years that have passed on like clouds...but you just don't know when the rain will drop. So with falling rain drops on my head,  covering me in blistering cold, I have no blanket, I'm just a poor man with a bedridden heart. Oh well...guess the sun shines on only some, leaving the rest & me....in a desperate struggle for light. We all struggle in this world, in this selfish world that strives on all your misgivings. I look outside, seeing all the old, greyed man wearing hats to cover themselves...because nobody even looks at their face. The birth of new race, unforgiven peanace. Down to the dumb & dirty, we like to think ourselfs as clean even though a hundred baths won't erase all your dirt. What you do, the bearing on one's soul, the rotting of hungry gold, you're just another player in the cold. Who is the woman? Who is the man? Is is the woman who makes the man? Vice-versa? What are we talking here? Hello? Hello?? How low? How old? What? What? This plaster on my skin is the real source of my bleeding, I tell you. But...what can one do? Just sigh, put your head low, let other's pride walk all over you, like you're the unforgiven II. Forget it, you're just you. Forget the freak, you're just nature. You're just nothing, as much as you think of everything. You're the only key which opens your tortures. You sigh as you live, you dream all the time about life. But do you see the clocks making a joke out of you?

      Try to look for reasons and I find the darkest seasons where the grass don't feel it's greens It was never meant to be seen  The creed of the crows makes a heart reap what it sow unmasking the puppet of the show now look how old I grow  The scavenger waiting in the trees born is the child of it's diesease no last chance to appease they've thrown out the book of pleas  Wait in the knifes of endless questions wait till you're cut a burning sensation wait till everlong....so far it's gone Am I the only one gone all wrong?
