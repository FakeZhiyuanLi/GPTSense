       Here's 100 things, totally copying Angel's blog, but she pirated the idea from others, so I don't feel so bad. I'll leave my creativity for other entries. So, drumroll, please, for...100 things!      1. My mom calls me "The Frog" because when I was an infant I slept curled up like a little baby frog with my butt in the air   2. I rarely shave my legs and if I do it's only up to two inches above the knee because I work in an office and sometimes...it just looks wrong to see hair poking through nylons in the shade of 'nude.' Or for John. And he appreciates it. He told me so once. (But once doesn't merit an ongoing process)   3. I once moved to Lancaster, PA to live with a 56-year-old divorcee I met through work. This didn't work out. I left for a husband I hadn't met and kids I don't yet have. And I left everything I own there and hopped a train to Minneapolis. 32 hours later I was home in Duluth and living at Grandma's house...minus Grandma   4. I can't bake cookies. I CAN bake banana bread. And meatloaf. And chicken.    5. I once staged a one-woman-riot outside of a club in Superior, WI called Stargate. It was racially driven. I threw a drunken fit outside and refused to leave until bar-close   6. I won the 'Silver Pen' award in 1993 for writing a short story about a guy who cheated his way through school to become a doctor. It didn't have a happy ending. I lost the pen on the Duluth Central High School football field a year later while launching pop-bottle rockets with Mr. Tranvik's Applied Science class   7. My first crush was Ritchie Valens, then Buddy Holly, The Everly Brothers, Dion, Ricky Nelson, Jerry Lee Lewis, Eddie Cochran, Brian Wilson, Nelson, and the list goes on. I wasn't a normal 12-year-old   8. When I was born, my tear ducts were locked and I could not produce tears   9. If I eat kiwi, my tongue swells and closes my throat off and my lips become raw and sensitive   10. I think women are evil and vindictive and cruel to men and I think men are the single sweetest thing on this earth. The way they can love so quietly and completely. Women whine too much about putting the toilet seat down or letting the soap melt in the soap dish. Learn to cope. Why does HE have to put the seat down? Why don't YOU learn how to lift it up?    11. I love Sesame Street. Not the muppets themselves or anything that stupid. I love the old songs, the little cartoons in them, the skits, everything. I HATE the muppets. Especially Elmo. How did he ever garner 20 minutes of that program dedicated to HIM?   12. I wanted to be a special education teacher and that's what I went to school for...until I caught the bus that goes to Goodwill everyday and got to know each and every one of these 'special' individuals and realized there's no way I would have the arsenal of patience required to deal with them on a daily basis.   13. I called my brother "The Tin Man" for two years because I wanted to be Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. Apparently I also wanted to have a sign erected at the end of our driveway that read "The Emerald City." This was after I buried my little brother with stuffed animals in his crib when he was 6 months old.   14. I invented the perfect party appetizer. Here's the recipe:    One block of cream cheese   Two cans baby shrimp   One bottle cocktail sauce   One box Ritz Crackers   Spread cream cheese evenly onto a large plate. Dump cocktail sauce onto cream cheese, spread uniformily as well. Sprinkle baby shrimp all over cocktail sauce. Use Ritz Crackers to drag along the plate, scraping up all the goodness and stuff into mouth and enjoy   15. I've spent an obnoxious amount of time making daisy chain crowns, picking dandelions, popping sap sacs on pine trees, stroking frog eggs in ponds, and collecting such things as spring peepers (baby frogs) in Grandma's backyard, caterpillars from blades of grass in the field outside, wading in marsh marigold swamps, finding woodticks on me, looking for four-leaf clovers, making a duck call from a blade of grass, catching fireflies, coveting nice fat toads, kissing frogs, illegally collecting Lady Slippers (state flower), sucking honey out of clover heads, feeding birds & blowing the fuzz from dandelions   16. I spit in my ice cream when I'm not close to water because I can't eat ice cream like a normal person.  It has to be all mashed up and maltish before I let it touch my tongue   17. I drool when I'm getting it from behind   18. My favorite foods: mashed potatoes & gravy, meatloaf &amp; ketchup, spaghetti & garlic bread, grilled cheese sandwiches &amp; tomato soup, shrimp cocktail, strawberry smoothies, vegetables and dill dip, deviled eggs, biscuits & gravy, tacos &amp; noodle salads   19. I develop organic bladder infections off & on   20. I vomit every time I'm nervous   21. A million dollars would make me a bitter and shallow woman and I would not be any happier.  All I would like money-wise is to pay off any debts I might owe   22. I rather enjoy spinach and brussel sprouts, raw mushrooms, saurkraut, cottage cheese mixed liberally with french dressing...but I hate onions, peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers   23. I once slept with a one-legged man.  It was not good.  I did all the work.  Oh, side note:  they take the prosthetic off.  That's all I really wanted to know on that one anyhow   24. I saw The Lion King 7 times in movie theatres.  I saw E.T. 3 times in theatres.  I was 5.  Other movies I saw multiple times in theatres:  Man in the Iron Mask, Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone, Shallow Hal, I Am Sam, Titanic (twice, left halfway through the second time), The Horse Whisperer, Anastasia, Good Will Huntingthat's all I can think of   25. This is a message I posted on the Tim Robbins message board:        Wouldn't life be wonderful if we all just followed the 'leader' off a cliff like lemmings whenever he decided to see fit? I mean, we DID rightfully and fairly elect him our leader, correct? So we should get on our knees and swear to do his bidding, is that what you're all saying? I don't see Mr. Robbins taking it upon himself personally to assasinate our president. And, if you're all going to rant about using his celebrity to do so, why wouldn't he pop into the White House with lovely Susan and get the job done? I mean, I'm sure he could hammer his way out of prison once he's sentenced to life without parole. He has respect for this leader. That doesn't mean you have to agree with him. Hundreds of people write reams of reviews critiquing this man's acting performance, directing style, versatility, range, depth of character, etc...every single day. And you really think that matters? We all love his movies. Love them. They're classics. You all said it yourselves. You hate his politics, but you love his movies. Movie critics base their careers on picking apart the months it takes an actor to get into a characters' head and give a performance of Oscar-winning calibur, but Mr. Robbins has ONE opinion, about our country, war, terrorism, our future as a nation, as a world, and we rip him apart? After reading all of these messages, I'm absolutely appalled that first off, I live in a country where no one can spell, much less write. With few exceptions, nothing moved me here. You're all very small, close-minded people. And knowing that you're here talking about people, or in particular, ONE person, and how he's successful where you are not, and he got that way because he knows who he is and stands up for it on a daily if not minutely basis and will pass that on to his children, I hope to God, speaks loads of your intelligence level. It takes a small mind to talk about people. It takes a great mind to talk about ideas. Mr. Robbins is an incredibly gifted mind. Take a lesson from him.       I know, I should really get a life, I know   26. In a past life, I was my great grandmother.  I remember my death very well for I was trampled to death by horses after a funeral   27. I am Swedish and Norwegian & that's it.  Not many people living in America can say they're heritage is so pure.  I'm not jealous of them at all when they list 11 separate lineages.     28. All I ever ask for on my birthday is frosting.  No money, no drinks, no presents, just frosting.  And damned if I never seem to get it.   29. I once licked a long icicle that was lying in our front yard one winter, realized it was stuck to my tongue, and proceeded to rip it quickly and forcefully off my tongue.  You'd be amazed at the amount of blood that produces.  You'd be more amazed to see what that amount of blood can do to your mothers' heart rate   30. I've broken both my arms and my thumb.  Broke one arm ice skating on Grandma's pond right before Christmas vacation, broke the other arm the following year, same exact time, rollerskating.  The rink gave us free passes to make up for it.  Broke my thumb fighting with my brother over a two-liter bottle of pop.  I jammed it into his stomach and it bent weird or something.  The results still aren't back on that one   31. I have a lisp but I cover it well   32. I used to have a gap between my two front teeth until my mother decided to have it bridged and joined.  I'm still upset about it   33. I have brain seizures every once in a while   34. I have the biggest writer's lump on my middle finger   35. I once had 28 orgasms in 45 minutes.  I was trying to beat a record.  And I did.  I was 14, though.  I had more stamina then   36. My first boyfriend turned out to be gay   37. My second boyfriend should be locked in a mental institution   38. I hate lotion, body wash, foundation, cover-up, eyeshadow, exfoliants, wrinkle-creams, & most everything else women love   39. I don't wear thong underwear like everybody else because I don't like it and can't imagine learning to live with it 'after a while.'  I don't see the point.  What's wrong with pink cotton bikinis?   40. I wear thigh-high stockings to work when I'm feeling amorous.     41. I would rather give head than get it.  ANY DAY   42. I'm very upset that baseball players are no longer wearing tight pants.  Very upset.  You'll never know   43. My great grandmother had my grandma when she was 28, my grandma had my mom when she was 28, my mom had me when she was 28, on the 28th of October, my parents were married on February 28th, my grandparents' anniversary is my birthday, there are 28 days in my menstrual cycle, etc...basically, I have until January 28th the get pregnant and have a girl.  It's not gonna happen.  To be honest, I don't really want it to happen.  Me with a baby would be more of a disaster or something funny to watch   44. I love Big League Chew-Grape   45. My favorite cereals are Corn flakes or Rice Chex-best with hand-picked wild strawberries   46. The only place I'll wear my biniki is at the cemetery.  There's more privacy   47. I call people 'bro' on a daily basis, including business associates   48. I have an official 'Remember the Titans' press kit sent to me by David Reid, my best girlfriend   49. I cannot believe I'm only halfway through this   50. Things that have happened to me as a result of domestic violence: foot split open on a drinking glass-heavy blood loss, held at knifepoint in my apartment, strangled on my own bed, thrown off my bed; bruised tailbone, grabbed by my hair, thrown into walls, pushed into a table that split my foot open again-same night as the drinking glass episode & that's about it   51. The customers I work with oftentimes send me pictures of their trucks and such since I sell oil and I just hang them up all over my workstation for fun   52. There's a lot of my friends' sons and their friends that have pre-pubescent crushes on me   53. I love AXE   54. I wish I could smell like almond, glazed donuts, bananas, or junior mints   55. I love wearing skirts & rarely wear pants to work   56. I hate when people have bangs   57.  I have a small but meaningful crush on Evan Peters   58. I used to braid my hair every night when it was wet in tiny little braids and then take them out in the morning so I looked like Diana Ross   60. One of my favorite shows is American Chopper   61. The only thing I've ever stolen is a small red dice.  I still have it today.  It wards off evil spirits   62. When I was 12, my favorite thing was square-dancing   63. I have the bladder of a camel.  I can go at least 24 without peeing.  Not on purpose or anything.  Well, sometimes   64. My gay uncle was in the New York Times for renewing his vows with his husband in San Francisco   65. I lived right next door to my Grandma, who I adored at age 6, and would pack my suitcase for a weekend at her house and leave it in the porch so I could come home after school, dump off my schoolbooks and pick up my suitcase without ever even saying 'hi' to my parents!  GENIUS!   66. I dated my third cousin for 4 years   67. If getting married means my sex drive drops, I'm never getting married   68. Same with having kids   69. I can easily forgive those who've wronged me, but if anyone screws with my family, I have a very hard time letting that go   70. I have a healthy appreciation for the female body but would never experiment with a woman sexually.  Men don't understand this.  It frustrates them beyond words, I know   71. I have three chicken pox scars on my body   72. No one in my high school graduating class knew who I was on graduation day because I got contacts the day before   73. I believe in over-tipping   74. I know the words to so many movies it frightens me sometimes   75. I'm impressed with others who know movie lines   76. When I was a freshman in high school, the cutest guy in school kissed me on the forehead because he beaned me in the head with a basketball.  I was the envy of all of my friends.  And my enemies :) .  I also had a football player carry me to the nurse's office, same year, when I was light-headed.  I think I was working an angle   77. I adore Christmas lights   78. My one true fear is spiders   79. I would like to someday live on a farm.  Or at least have chickens   80. I enjoy walking barefoot in mud   81. I often wonder 'what ever happened to men who wear briefs?'   82. If you took me to a fair and came to pick me up later, I would be in the animal barns, watching the rodeo or eating teeny weeny donuts/cotton candy   83. Places in the world I'd like to visit:  the Ngorongoro Crater in Africa, London (more specifically, Buckingham Palace), Alexandria, VA, Washington D.C., New York City, Zihuatenejo, Mexico & Sweden   84. I was born two weeks overdue, they induced labor which lasted 19 hours, I was losing oxygen so they did a C-section.  My poor mother.  She craved grapefruit through the whole pregnancy and threw up to & until the day I was born   85. I once took 50 erotic and tasteful pictures of myself on my ex's digital camera only to have him transfer them all to his computer and take them with him when we broke up.  I'm pretty sure he hasn't erased those.  They were so hot   86. My favorite flower is the cowslip/marsh marigold   87. I believe Danielle Steele sucks as an author and her literature is a joke   88. I think corporal punishment is a necessity   89. I think smoking when you're pregnant should be an offense you can be arrested for   90. Foreplay is completely separate from sex, and yet it's the only thing that will get me to want to go there   91. I believe that some TV is good for children, and so is reading, whether it's comic books or novels, whether you read to them or they read to themselves.  I think you should indulge your childs' interests as much as you can.  You should live somewhere where they can walk around in grass and climb trees and see wildlife.  Where they can feed birds and weed a garden.  They should have chores like doing the dishes and cleaning or dusting, taking out the garbage.  They should shovel and mow the lawn   92. I say 'bless you' when people cough or hiccup   93. I think that people who have no respect for children, the elderly, the mentally or physically handicapped, those that need more than we do, are a waste of flesh   94. I love staring at fire   95. I love the smell of OFF, gas, oil, manure, hay, & skunk   96. All army worms should be destroyed   97. The perfect restaurant is KFC   98. Chopping vegatables is cathartic   99. I once had to go to the ER for putting a ring on my finger and being unable to remove it.     100. I love the feeling of accomplishment

       Yeah, I'd seen Shawshank Redemption like, three times. And when Shane 'rented' it from my parents in March, I thought "Good choice. That's a good movie," and that's about it. But when the days got short and the nights got long I watched it one night. I think it was a Sunday. For fun. And, my addiction began. My obsession. For Tim Robbins. Andy Dufresne, Ebby Calvin 'Nuke' LaLoosh, Dave Boyle, Oliver Lang/William Fenimore, Mrs. Tim Sarandon, etc...whatever. He's a thing of beauty. Not sure why. The character he portrays in Shawshank is the direct answer to 'what is the opposite of Nuke Laloosh?' from Bull Durham. Versatility. And in keeping with the fact that I'm never attracted to men who are...attractive?...I've been successful! He looks like no one. He's not hot. He's not anything. And yet there is infinite beauty etched all over his person. So this is my latest obsession. The blog title refers to the fact that I'm always obsessed with one media character or another, regardless of my personal boyfriend status.    I tried to write John a poem/letter last night but it came out rambly and had too many 'and's' in it, run-on sentences and such. It was about how when you're young and you write poems about your sig. other, you tend to use those no-no words like 'forever' and 'never' and 'always' and 'promise.' I guess now that I'm older and forever doesn't last just a half an hour I just can't bring myself to use those words. But I'm fascinated with him right now. And he has a healthy tolerance for my obsession. He knew from the start that Timmy was it for now. The flavor of a few months. He indulged me and we watched 'Arlington Road' a few weekends ago and he was happy with my reaction. I was rather upset that Tim played the bad guy in this film but John loved watching me cringe. He loved watching me cringe on our forced march at Split Rock this Saturday as well. But then he bought me dinner, and that made up for the scrape I got on my foot in the stream and being deprived of food and water for four hours. Nothing says reward like 'Cheeseburger.' Of course a reward to  John  would be strips upon strips of healthy bacon or a box of Swiss Cake Rolls. Or head.

       Well, this is day one, post one, volume one of my... blog . Such a lovely name for a diary you secretly want others to stumble upon. My brother suggested I get and maintain a blog which is 'free!' because he has one and it's really improved his life. He's at:  urlLink http://strandedcalf.blogspot.com    I'd check it out. He's got a wicked sense of humor and a  lot  going on from what I read today. Today I got to work at five to eight, did all the work that had accumulated for me over the weekend and was done at 8:11. Then I started  this  thing. As you can see, I don't have much to do at work.  Or  home.    Let me tell you about work: Work is a place where anything I have to do on any given day can be successfully completed in less than half an hour. Then I go online and read things; blogs, essays, message boards. I have adventures with Pokey the Penguin:  urlLink http://yellow5.com  I become educated. And like my mother said about this tendency I have "They can't take THAT away from you." So for 7-8 hours a day here I sit, wishing I was at home.   As for home/ free time, time when I should be doing things like walking through the door at 5:15 and...taking out the garbage, or...doing the dishes, perhaps cooking myself a meal, tidying up, relaxing with my thoughts, I tend to walk through the door, yes. But after that, I usually somehow find a drink in my hand and my ass on a couch cushion. After one drink and a half an hour of Bull Durham, I'm ready to sing. In fact, I'm fully convinced that there should have been a third Judd and I could have been it. Or that Patsy Cline is my grandmother and I've inherited all of her singing ability. So I hook the mic up to one of three karaoke machines I have in my possession (Two of which are broken, having been given to me by my father. See my brothers' blog re: The Recorder) and proceed to sing my lungs out.    Unless John's over. Then it's a whole different ball game. I'll take a shower and maybe shave my legs. Maybe. I'll cook something good and hot because he doesn't have family up here and never gets to eat home-cooked meals like, pork chops or steak or chicken. So I do that for him. I like feeding guys. Especially if they can't cook and know how to make a million things better than I do. And it's like they're meant to do this while watching the Simpsons. And watching them eat and laugh at things is like watching a movie. A movie you're directing. In a way. Anyways...we'll watch a flick, end up fooling around on the couch, and when I get too aroused for the couch to contain my exciteratement or I've just now noticed that I'm no longer wearing a significant amount of clothing, I scoop up my clothes and grab John by the hand and drag him so unwillingly into my bedroom. I tell ya, he's got this voice. He took drama in high school and really paid attention, because he's always telling me about how to fill your lungs and how to project from the diaphragm, and how to speak crisply and carry a big stick. I put that last part in myself there. He pronounces things with precision and perfect enunciation and with a low voice, a suggestive voice and when he's talking in your ear like this, behind you, his arms wrapped around you in bed, driving you nuts because you have an ear thing and he KNOWS it, I thank God for the arts in our schools.
