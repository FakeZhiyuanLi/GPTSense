      Don't you just love 'em?  A first grade teacher collected well-known proverbs.

Here they are:  Better to be safe than....................punch a 5th grader. Strike while the.............................bug is close.

The answers they got were broader and deeper than anyone could have imagined...  When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend over and paint her toenails anymore.  So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even when his hands got arthritis too. That's love. -- Rebecca - age 8  When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. You know that your name is safe in their mouth. -- Billy, age 4  Love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other. -- Karl, age 5  Love is when my Mommy makes coffee for my Daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him, to make sure the taste is OK. -- Danny, age 7  Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents and listen. -- Bobby, age 7  If you want to learn to love better, you should start with a friend who you hate. -- Nikka, age 6  Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then he wears it everyday. -- Noelle, age 7  My Mommy loves me more than anybody. You don't see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night. -- Clare, age 6  Love is when Mommy gives Daddy the best piece of chicken. -- Elaine, age 6  Love is when Mommy sees Daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than Robert Redford. -- Chris, age 7  Love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day. -- Mary Ann, age 4  I know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones. -- Lauren, age 4  When you love somebody, your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you. -- Karen, age 7  ******************************************************* Kids Say the Darndest Things...	 	  Never trust a dog to watch your food.  Patrick, age 10   When your dad is mad and asks you, "Do I look stupid?" don't answer him. Heather, 16   Never tell your mom her diet's not working.  Michael, 14   Stay away from prunes.  Randy, 9   Don't squat with your spurs on. Noronha, 13   Don't pull dad's finger when he tells you to. Emily, 10   When your mom is mad at your dad, don't let her brush your hair.  Taylia, 11   Never allow your three-year old brother in the same room as your school assignment. Traci, 14   Don't sneeze in front of mum when you're eating crackers.  Mitchell, 12   Puppies still have bad breath even after eating a tictac.  Andrew, 9   Never hold a dust buster and a cat at the same time.  Kyoyo, 9   You can't hide a piece of broccoli in a glass of milk.  Armir, 9   Don't wear polka-dot underwear under white shorts.  Kellie, 11   If you want a kitten, start out by asking for a horse.  Naomi, 15   Felt markers are not good to use as lipstick.  Lauren, 9   Don't pick on your sister when she's holding a baseball bat.  Joel, 10   When you get a bad grade in school, show it to your mom when she's on the phone.  Alyesha, 13   *******************************************************  Below is a compilation of actual student bloopers collected by teachers  from 8th through 12th grades.  1) Ancient Egypt was inhabited by mummies and they all wrote in hydraulics. They lived in the Sarah Dessert and traveled by Camelot. The climate of the Sarah is such that the inhabitants have to live elsewhere.  2) The Bible is full of interesting caricatures. In the first book of the Bible, Guinessis, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree. One of their children, Cain, asked, "Am I my brother's son?"  3) Moses led the Hebrew slaves to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread which is bread made without any ingredients. Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments. He died before he ever reached Canada.  4) Solomom had three hundred wives and seven hundred porcupines.  5) The Greeks were a highly sculptured people, and without them we wouldn't have history. The Greeks also had myths. A myth is a female moth.   6) Actually, Homer was not written by Homer but by another man of that name.  7) Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people advice. They killed him. Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock. After his death, his career suffered a dramatic decline.  8) In the Olympic games, Greeks ran races, jumped, hurled the biscuits, and threw the java.  9) Eventually, the Romans conquered the Greeks. History calls people Romans because they never stayed in one place for very long.  10) Julius Caesar extinguished himself on the battlefields of Gaul. The Ides of March murdered him because they thought he was going to be made king. Dying, he gasped out: "Tee hee, Brutus."  11) Nero was a cruel tyranny who would torture his subjects by playing the fiddle to them.  12) Joan of Arc was burnt to a steak and was cannonized by Bernard Shaw.  13) Finally Magna Carta provided that no man should be hanged twice for the same offense.  14) In mid-evil times most people were alliterate. The greatest writer of the futile ages was Chaucer, who wrote many poems and verses and also wrote literature.  15) Another story was William Tell, who shot an arrow through an apple while standing on his son's head.  16) Queen Elizabeth was the "Virgin Queen." As a queen she was a success. When she exposed herself before her troops they all shouted "hurrah."  17) It was an age of great inventions and discoveries. Gutenberg invented removable type and the Bible. Another important invention was the circulation of blood. Sir Walter Raleigh is a historical figure because he invented cigarettes and started smoking. And Sir Francis Drake circumcised the world with a 100 foot clipper.  18) The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespeare. He was born in the year 1564, supposedly on his birthday. He never made much money and is famous only because of his plays. He wrote tragedies, comedies, and hysterectomies, all in Islamic pentameter. Romeo and  Juliet are an example of a heroic couplet. Romeo's last wish was to be laid by Juliet.  19) Writing at the same time as Shakespeare was Miguel Cervantes. He wrote Donkey Hote. The next great author was John Milton. Milton wrote Paradise Lost. Then his wife died and he wrote Paradise Regained.   20) During the Renaissance America began. Christopher Columbus was a great navigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic. His ships were called the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Fe. Later, the Pilgrims crossed the ocean, and this was called Pilgrim's Progress. The winter of 1620 was a hard one for the settlers. Many  people died and many babies were born. Captain John Smith was responsible for all this.

      I love TV shows. I love a whole lot of them.  Ever since I started working different shifts, I have been missing out on a lot of good TV shows.  I missed most of Charmed. I missed most of Seventh Heaven. I missed most of CSI. I missed most of Friends.  (Yes, even the reruns.) I missed most of 24. I missed most of Oprah. I missed most of Six Feet Under. I missed most of Sex in the City. I missed most of Angel. I am not a fan of Alias and probably because I never got the chance to watch an episode.  Omygoodness... As in, a lot of good shows on TV... (I'm pathetic, right?)  What's sad is I try to make up for it by searching the shows' websites for the story gist to make up for it.  It's not the same, really.  For example, there's this show that's called "Queer Eye For The Straight Guy" (which was introduced to me by my boyfriend's cousin -- Thanks Charmaine!).  I saw their first episode and thought the show was really great.  These 5 gay guys (each with their areas of specialty) gave free make-overs to one straight guy at a time. You can check out their site:  http://www.bravotv.com/Queer_Eye_for_the_Straight_Guy/  Anyhoo, it's amazing what those 5 can do to the guys they transform.  It's also great to see the looks on their faces as well as the people around them after they've crossed over from "Ew!" to "Whoa!".  And I'm ranting because I can only read about them... Unless you know someone who's been avidly recording each episode I can borrow CDs or tapes (I'm desperate.) from.  I fear that I've missed a lot of good shows lately. If you've seen a good episode recently of the shows I've mentioned above, do tell me the story.  And I'd like the details too.  :o)  I'd rather hear the story from an excited fan rather than read it from their site.  Sigh.  So very  little time, so many shows to watch (or read about).    :o(

      A journal.  Back in college, I used a lot of steno pads as journals.  For my poems, my love stories, my heartaches, my lamentations on life, my favorite songs, my thoughts on anything and everything.  It's gonna be fun doing that all over again, the high-tech way.  (no loose sheets, no erasures, no half-torn pages)  The only catch?  Information HAS to be shared.  But that's okay by me.  After all, why do I write in the first place?  I just hope that I won't find myself getting bored with, well,... myself, after re-reading stuff in here.
