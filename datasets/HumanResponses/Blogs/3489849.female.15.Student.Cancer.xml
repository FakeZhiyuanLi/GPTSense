      Yes, i am babysitting! From 8 this morning to 6 this afternoon, but Ali is funny and me and erin are teaching her how to say peace out and octopus! Yes two totally different words, but it's fun.  Now we're watching Spongebob and tryign to get her to fall asleep, maybe it would help if we actually watched something she liked....*cough erin cough* change the channel.  Okay i put her video in her T.V. and it's playing like "naptime music" and what not.  So maybe she'll fall asleep.  We've already been out in her backyard for like an hour or so. And she's rubbing her eyes.  So yeah. anyway i'm done describinb what Ali looks like when she's sleepy.   So besides that WEDNESDAY IS MY BIRTHDAY! And i'm going to waterworld with bab and then Beaujos later that night with Teej, so i think it'll b fun! I can't wait, cuz a week after my b day i'm taking drivers ed and since i'll already b 15 i can get my lisence the first day! :-D Yay!  Toodles 4 now! -Kel

      Not rly, he just has pink eye! But regardless, i have to put this ointment in his eye twice a day and im sure the first time i try to hold him still and do that he's gonna rip my hand off and then i'll bleed to death and then my hamster will take over the world...and....*falls into a daze* I can't let that happen!!!! Today was fun, hung out with Ellen and then went to Tj's and Keith was there too and then we hung out at my house and then Ellen stayed for dinner (and somewhere in there we went to the vet) and now ellen is playing some skateboard game on my gamecube and some time tonight we're gonna go to blockbuster and rent It Takes Two *plz dont ask* and Eurotrip! Woot et woot.   Toodles! -Kelz0rz

      Hello...yesterday was fun! Went to see The Terminal with Keith, Steven and Laura.  It was pretty good but rly confusing! Then i went to night swim with the same people minus steven and earlier in the day i had previously gone to the pool with Christine.  So on top of Hawaii I did even more swimming yesterday!! Ellen is home so today we're prolly gonna hang out and then Bab gets home tomorrow!! :-D It sucks that as soon as i get home she leaves for New Mexico without any warning! Anyway my dad needs the computer for a while now, so... ummm.. Toodles i guess! -Kelz0rz

      BEEJ! I'm home and i need ur help badly.  Here's the horrible news.  Brace yourself...*deep breath* I left my CD's on the plane to SanFrancisco...:(!! That includes the Kelz0rz Mix one and two! I hate to ask again but do you think you could make me two new ones? If not that's okay, but if u could it'd be greatly greatly greatly appresiated!   But anyway...speaking of my trip to Hawaii now is a good time to write about it.  So as you know in the very beginning i lost my cds...then the flight to Hawaii was good, until i noticed my Cd's were gone, i just about died!  So some highlights of our trip (so that i don't have to write everything out)....lesse i'll start with Oahu, didn't like it much, but it's cuz i had bad experiences there! #1. Got heat stroke very very badly and i was rly rly sick and stuck in the hotel room for a day.  #2. While i was sick apparently the people we were there with (The Gress Family) well yeah, their rental car got broken into and their 600 dollar video camera was stolen.  So then after 4 days in Oahu we went to Kauai for the last 10 days of our vacation.  Kauai was much better! My sister got stung by a jellyfish, i thought it was pretty funny cuz it was right in the middle of her chest. We also go to do the zipline up at like...Kanaka Falls or something and IT WAS THE COOLEST THING IVE EVER DONE!! It's about a 250 feet ride all the way and i did it totally upside down the whole time.  It was nothing but awesome!! We also went on snorkling tours, saw dolphins and turtles.  And...im tan! woohoo! I'll put in some cool pictures of my trip when i get around to it, we just got back today so dont really expect it too soon, guess what else...i haven't slept for over 28 hours! WHAT NOW BRITT AND LAURA! lol...i pulled an all nighter, thanks to the fact that i cannot sleep on an airplane no matter how hard i try. Toodles -Kelz0rz

We couldn't find any internet cafe's or anything in Kauai or Oahu, so i just deicded to keep an old fashioned journal and type some random stuff out of it in here when i get back! But now i'm gonna go to Keith's baseball game with Lola, so toodles!
