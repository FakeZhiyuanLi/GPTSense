      Inside  Dont have a job cant pay for it. Keep messin up Need to stop Got to get rid of A friend or two Not sure how to deal Cant put it into words No one knows What I truly feel  Need to be clean A start again Hate how I am WIsh I could change Loathe most things about myself People see me How they want to I have friends  Many indeed  My birthday is soon A show will be brodcasted Fact? It is not Most of it anyway

      Hey ppl, well, ive been rereading this poem i wrote. im particulary proud of it. so im gonna post it again. im still feeling the same way that i was when i wrote it. so here goes....(tell me what you think of it)  Look there she is Right there in front of me You don't see her? She's right there She is the girl with many friends but only a few close to her She is lonely and single because She is known as "just one of the guys" Are you sure you don't see her She is right there Right there in front of me She is somewhat of a passive, laidback girl She doesn't put a lot of effort into how she looks She is pretty and popular And considered a goddess In her own world. She is right there,  Right there in front of me Can you see her now? She is facing me She is mocking me Make her stop, I can't go on She is REAL, I tell you. And you still can't see her She is right there Right there in that... Mirror  ~Niki original~

      The House  All are gone,  the house is... quiet.them already So...very.... sad. I miss .  The house... smells of cigarette smoke.  The memories... are here and many.  My cousins... left behind some stuff.  Perfect reason... to visit them!!!  The mad crazy house... has returned to the boring, old, normal self, once again.   Sad...like I said.  ~Niki Orginal~ written this past summer.

      Untitled  Eyes which can not see  have no trouble speaking harsh words  Eyes which can not see have no trouble listening only to certain things  Eyes which can not see have no trouble pushing away someone close  Eyes which can not see have no trouble opening a wound  Eyes which can not see have no trouble walking away forever  Eyes which can not see have no trouble being naive  Open  your  eyes, See the truth, Realize what  you  have done, Before it is lost, Forever.

      Untitled  She wants attention from a guy in mind The things she likes are hard to find  She acts all giddy and flat out beams Just thinking of the man of her dreams  She dances around her house with delight The guy she wants is no longer out of sight  The phone rings, she's got a date Finally a chance with her soulmate  As he arrives dressed to impress plus more She now sees, he's the boy next door.
