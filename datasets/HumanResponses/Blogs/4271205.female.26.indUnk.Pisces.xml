      I lost my Passport and am suppose to be going on vacation in two weeks!  Now I have to have an emergency service expedite my application so that I won't miss my vacation.  I've lost my passport before, but it was taken care of for me b/c it was the fault of the airlines for losing our luggage.  Luckily we were back in the states.  And yes, I am absent minded  enough not to remember to put my Passport in my carry-on luggage or purse.  Terrible, I know.  Anyway,  here I am trying to fill out the online customer verification forms and my computer freezes.  Okay, no problem.  I'll just open another window and redo it.  Now their site is down!  I've got a headache now.  So I call the service and he says that the site is down, but I should try again in 15 minutes.  Okay, fine.   It's official.  I won't be able to get this stuff done until tommorrow, but the guy says I should still get my Passport by Sept. 1st. STRESS!

      I auditioned for "The Crucible" on Monday for the part of Tituba. She is the slave in the story of The Salem Witch trials that plagued Salem, Massachusetts in the 1600's. It is a really powerful story and I thought that it would be a good piece to do to show my emotional range. Though I knew that if I was cast in You're a Good Man Charlie Brown it would be kind of hard to do both because the rehearsals would overlap. But it would have been possible.  That is, until I got an e-mail from the co-founder of the theatre company saying "We've decided to go with another actress for Tituba. We feel she needs to be more of a middle aged woman, and you're just too young and pretty to fit that image. :- )"  Now I, like anyone else, love a good compliment. But, in this case, I think she was just trying to cushion the fact that I didn't get the part. (now would be a good time to refer to the title of my blog)   I appreciate her complimenting me to cushion the blow, but it wasn't necessary and certainly wasn't sincere. Age I can see being a problem, but make-up can make a person look the part. Just  urlLink look  at what they did to  urlLink Vanessa Williams in "Into The Woods" . They made her a witch. Yuk!  I am also tired of every playwright thinking that middle-aged black women are the only black actresses in the theatre. Musicals aren't so bad...at least not the modern ones. But straight plays seem to only portray the middle-aged or grandma-aged black woman b/c she is usually there to signify wisdom or culture. For example: The character of Tituba is a slave from Barbados, she represents both. So unless the director embraces non-traditional or color blind casting, it's almost a lost cause.  By the way, has anyone seen "The Crucible"? I rented the video and watched it before I went to the audition. I thought the movie was quite good. It's stars Winona Ryder as Abigail. This time she's trying to steal someone's husband instead of clothes, but it's still and interesting movie.

      My company is going through a restructuring because, all of a sudden, the stockholders want to know everything that's going on and what everyone's specific job description is. Apparently the dividend checks were quite healthy last go-round and they see this company as a huge asset.  It's all fine with me, but I live in the quiet part of the building and when the contractor comes in to meet with the department heads it is quite disturbing. First of all his voice is hella loud. Even with the door closed you can hear his conversation TOO loud and clear. And since he meets with everyone individually he is here all day. I was trying to write a press release earlier and mistakenly typed what he was saying b/c he was so loud! I keep meaning to bring my headphones but I am too much of a scatterbrain to remember. Luckily this only happens every other week and when he's done he'll be gone forever, or at least until the next time the stockholders want to spy.  I guess I'm a little spoiled b/c there are only two people in Advertising and we have this side of the building all to ourselves. They call us the Advertising snobs, b/c we rarely socialize with rest of the people here. But we really have no reason to. And if we do, there's always e-mail or ICQ. Hey, that's rhymes!  This makes me think of Office Space, b/c  urlLink Shawn  loves that movie. He said he gave it to his co-worker and she had to watch it two times to get it. I thought it was a funny movie. I think he likes it so much b/c he once was, or maybe still is, the guy who makes the TPS reports. He told me that his department has to watch a movie together today for some kind of B of A (Bank of America) bonding and he was going to try and slip in Office Space. The bank can be a weird place.

      I got a call from the director of You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown last night and he offered me the role of Lucy. I wanted the role of Sally, but after thinking about it....a black girl in a blonde wig would just be wrong! Even if it is the theatre. The only reason I wanted to be Sally was so I could sing "My New Philosophy" anyway. But it's a really fun song. Lucy, however, is the lead female role. So I'm excited. There are only two females in the cast and four males; Charlie Brown, Schreoder, Linus, and Snoopy.  I just finished doing Cinderella at Old Courthouse Theatre in Concord. I was Joy, one of the evil stepsisters. I had fun but was kind of overshadowed b/c we had a guy in drag playing Portia, the other stepsister. He was really funny but keeping up w/ him was a workout....and I've got scars on my knees to prove it! You know Drag Queens, they are major upstagers!! Major! But the crowd loved it so I guess we did our job.  By the way "You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown" is a musical about the Peanuts characters. The director also told me who else was going to be in the cast. We have a very talented group, so I know that it's going to be a great show! Rehearsal starts Monday!

      Well I finally decided to start a blog since I never have time to update my  urlLink website . Not to mention the fact that am extremely bored today. I have a lot of work on my desk, but doing it is boring me to death b/c it's monotonous search engine work.  Earlier today I decided to call my sister who just moved into a new apartment and out of my mother's house. She wasn't there but my other sister was. We talked for about 30 minutes and just as my spirits were starting to rise she tells me that she's pregnant. What! I was in disbelief!   Background info: My other sister (who's house I called) is pregnant as well. And they both aren't married and already have a child.   Now I'm thinking to myself, "Don't they have condoms in Charleston or are you allergic to them?"  Then she tells me that she's 19 weeks. That's almost 5 months!! Why doesn't anybody ever tell me anything? If I hadn't called I would have been none the wiser. She then informs me that her and her boyfriend are getting married before the child comes. I don't quite know what I think about that yet. I like her boyfriend and all, but I'm not sure that they should be getting married just b/c they have a child on the way. Then again, what's the alternative.  My mother seems to be okay with the idea of her getting married, though I'm sure she's not really thrilled about the pregnancy. They are already living together so I guess the whole situation could be a lot worse. Oh, well. I guess I'm now preparing to be an Auntie for the 5th and 6th time.
