      I have come to the realization that I was born into a family that has a difficult time saying "I Love You," and consequently I can't help but feeling unloved or unwanted at times. Who would think that three of the shortest and most simple words in the english language are some of the hardest to say. I know that my parents love me, or I know my dad does, but it's hard to feel loved when they never say it. The last time I heard it was when I was in a car accident about a month and a half ago. So, does it take something like that to happen for them to come out and say it? It hurts. Because, their shortcoming has become my shortcoming and I hate it. I wish I could say it, but I don't know how or when. I am always afraid it will come out wrong or sound stupid. I can't wait to have kids so I can smother them with the very thing I want most right now. I am going to be the parent mine never were to me. I am going to make them the center of my universe. My kids will be the one thing I will not screw up...I am making that promise to myself and them right now.

       urlLink    Just downloaded that Hello photo hosting program so this picture is really just a test to see if it works, will probably be deleted tomorrow. Thought I would show all my adoring fans my killer tan line in the first photo. It's hot. Guess that's what I get for opting out of the nude beach though. And, if you're wondering, its all natural baby. No tanning salons for me. I promise. My family seriously spends just about every weekend at the lake. Nothing but natural-melanoma-causing UV rays for this gal. Mmm hmm.  Damn straight.   Anyway, watched John Kerry's nomination acceptance speech tonight. Suffice it to say that I was thoroughly impressed and captivated. He hit a home-run, as one of the news commentators aptly put it.  He'll make a great president, god willing he gets elected.  I won't be old enough to vote, so my fingers are crossed.   Have acquired strange obsession with making hemp bracelets and necklaces, bordering on compulsive behavior. Made probably 15-20 today.  I am wearing 8 as I type this.  Is that neurotic?   I wanted to say a quick hello to my newest online acquaintance, Sarah Beara, who may be the sole reader of this blog.  This may sound pitiful, but you made my day by posting a comment.  So, thanks in that regard.

      Just a few things I want to touch on tonight.&nbsp; The first being me and my relationships.&nbsp; If anyone out there in bloggerland doesn't want to read about my relationships (read: lack there of) then skip on ahead to the next paragraph.&nbsp;Ok, I have good relationships with the majority of my family most of the time.&nbsp; I have good relationships with my friends all the time.&nbsp; I have good relationships with members of the opposite sex none of the time. Why? Am I unattractive, undesirable, unapproachable, un...whatever? Am I too intimidating?&nbsp;I can work on that you know. Overall, it just pisses the hell out of me. Why don't I have a boyfriend? I kinda want one, even if he is a work in progress, Im up for the challenge.&nbsp;I want someone to hug me and kiss me and take me to the movies and offer me his jacket when I'm cold.&nbsp; I want a boy. Hell, I might even take a girl...more on that later.   Moving on, I drank a boat load of water today. Actually it was just the recommended servings...64 oz. I spent most of my afternoon running to the toilet because I had to pee.&nbsp; Couldn't get that "Gotta go Gotta go Gotta go Gotta go right now" song out of my head. Thinking I may have an over-active bladder.&nbsp; Will look into it.   The state of Colorado needs to take away my driver's license.&nbsp;Would appropriately consider myself one of the worst drivers to ever drive in the history of driving. Already have 4 points on my license and I've only had it a smidge over a year.&nbsp; Good lord.&nbsp;Oh, to those of you who are reading this (see: she's fooling herself, nobody reads this) who have the grave misfortune of not having a point system in your gret stet I shall enlighten you.&nbsp; One is given a driver's license.&nbsp; At first, one has 6 points allotted on this license until one should turn 18 whereupon one's driver's license achieves a 12 point alotation (is that a word?).&nbsp; If one gets a speeding ticket, one receives 1-2 points against one's license.&nbsp; If one gets in a wreck, on receives 2-4 points&nbsp;against one's license if wreck was one's fault.&nbsp; If one is being an ass behind the wheel (driving drunk, reckless driving, driving with a suspended license, etc) on receives 2-6 points against one's license.&nbsp; So, one (named Sam) has been in:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 wreck  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 situation involving a speeding ticket  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 situation involving a warning  Resulting in:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 total points on one's (Sams) license.  Sam mustn't get into trouble for the next 10 months or sam is in deep shite.&nbsp;

      Spent the majority of my afternoon and evening watching the Dem. Natl. Convention. I thought all the scheduled speakers tonight did exceptionally well.&nbsp;Especially Ted Kennedy and Teresa Heinz Kerry.&nbsp;Ted is such a wonderful public speaker and it shows in his speeches that he is proud to be a democrat (who wouldn't be?).&nbsp;I had never really paid much attention to Mrs. Kerry but tonight I was very impressed.&nbsp;Unlike her predecessors (Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Clinton) she is very good at speech delivery.&nbsp; Laura and Hillary both seem uncomfortable and sometimes it becomes unbearable to watch their monotone deliver.&nbsp;Teresa was quite graceful, eloquent, and she had the entire audience hanging on every word.  So, I said that I would finish my thoughts on 9/11 and the war tonight, but I don't really feel like it.&nbsp;I want to sit here eating my pringles, drinking my iced green tea, and write about whatever pops into my head.&nbsp;First thought...I absolutely love bookstores.&nbsp;I would love to waste away an afternoon walking around looking at books.&nbsp;There is just something so soothing about being surrounded my these stacks of paper and ink. It's quiet and comforting. I bought a book tonight, well two actually.&nbsp;The first is  Me Talk Pretty One Day  by David Sedaris.&nbsp;I saw him on David Letterman a few weeks ago promoting his latest book and he seemed pretty funny.&nbsp;I absolutely love his sister, Amy, who is one of the few&nbsp;people in the world&nbsp;that can make want to&nbsp;pee my pants because she is so funny. But I digress, from what...I'm not sure.&nbsp;  Next thought...I just tried to drink my pringles.&nbsp; I have the cup sitting on my right, and the pringles can on my left.&nbsp; Got a little confused...  Thought...I wonder if anybody reads my blog.&nbsp; I know that one person has...he left a comment on a post I deleted so there is no hard evidence of it anymore, but it happened, I promise.&nbsp;  On a related note...why does my blog never show up on the recently updated blog list?&nbsp; Has anybody ever seen their own blog on that list?&nbsp; I really hate it when I click on one and it turns out to be some naked woman staring at me.&nbsp; Ughh.&nbsp; I also hate those blogs where the author feels the need to confuse the hell out of me by not using English.&nbsp; Ok, it is English but it is all abbreviated and misspelled.&nbsp;  Because  becomes  coz,   you  becomes  u,   with  becomes  wit,   the  becomes  da,  and  anyways  becomes  newaiz .&nbsp; I will honestly sit there for far too long trying to crack the code that is their blog.&nbsp;When did this become cool?&nbsp;I think I'm out of touch which is sad because I am a teenager...we are supposed to be the ones in touch.&nbsp; Do people still say cool?&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I went for a drive last night, to Estes Park.  Arguably one of the most beautiful and scenic drives in the US.  But, I went at midnight so the scenery was lost in the darkness and all I could hear was the rushing waters of the Big Thompson river.  On my way up to Estes, I nearly had a stroke when my headlights shone brightly on the figure of a deer standing calmly on the side of the road waiting for me to pass.  It took me by surprise and my hand flew to my chest and I shouted "Oh my god" then laughed at myself for doing so.  I drove into Estes and of course the roads were barren.  It was like the town was shut down, I saw a handful of cars and even fewer people.  I flirted with the idea of going into Rocky Mountain National Park, but decided to save that for another midnight drive.  As I headed back down the mountain a fox darted out in front of my jeep.  I stomped on the brakes and swerved just enough to the right to let it turn around and scamper back to the other side of the road.  I think it almost had a stroke.  I love the drive to Estes, the curvy mountain roads and the crisp smell of pine and fresh air clear my head.  Ok, so the real reason I decided to post tonight is because I'm a little bit pissed off at the parents.  They made a severely bad decision.  Family vacations have always been pretty good.  We've traveled to some really great places: Maine, Boston, California, Oregon, Canada, Florida, and Alaska just to name a few.  The one we were planning was going to be the best.  We decided a few months ago that we would all like to go to Mexico.  Plans were made, but nothing was set in stone until they both finally got the vacation time scheduled for the end of August (the 18-25 to be exact...just in time for school to start on the 30th).  Anyway, we normally purchase plane tickets much earlier but there was a lot of hullabaloo about the vacation time for my dad and that didn't get straightened out until last week.  Fast forward to two days ago, my uncle calls from North Dakota and says that my cousin (brief background-had a stroke 7 years ago and consequently cannot use many of his left extremities including his hand, fingers, and facial muscles...leg works fine) just had surgery to fuse his left hand in place to prevent movement due to the fact that his tendons tense up a lot and they have to constantly surgically stretch them.  Doctor says it was the best and most humane option.  The decision was made, behind the doors of the master bedroom, that we are going to forego our magical paradise vacation that is Manzanillo, Mexico, for a seven day-six night stay in glorious North Dakota.  2 days included for driving.  Now I ask you, who would pass up 2 days of driving in a Suburban filled with 5 people that seems shrinks in size every mile as you cross the barren wasteland that is Wyoming, South Dakota, and North Dakota?  Added bonus, 5 days in a crappy, stinky, dirty motel room in a hodunk town named Minot.  Also included in your package is the uncomfortable conversation with relatives you haven't seen in 4 years.  And, if you call within the next five minutes, I'll add in a reminder which will haunt you every minute of your miserable summer vacation...you could have been on a beach in Manzanillo, Mexico relaxing as the waves crash against the shore. But, the real question still remains...why am I up at 3 in the morning writing about this?

      I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 tonight. I was very reluctant to see it because of all the controversy surrounding it and the words propaganda and what not being thrown around.&nbsp;I would consider my self a solid democrat, not overly conservative or overly radical...and this movie scared the hell out of me.&nbsp;To think that a man who puts his business relationships on a higher level than the well-being of a nation is running this country makes me ill. How did this joker get in the White House?  In my humble opinion, America was doomed from nearly the beginning of this dear country.&nbsp; America was an experiment.&nbsp; Can people control themselves enough to rule themselves?&nbsp; The 55 delegates put forth an idea of "republicanism."&nbsp; Making man not evil by making him think they are important and have power.&nbsp; The Constitution was written not to take power, not to stop the radical idea of the Declaration of Independence, but to insure them.&nbsp; It reflects the fear of "evil" men.&nbsp; Ex. State representatives, the federal system, a two house congress, the Electoral College, the elastic clause (art. I, sect 8, cl. 18), and state legislatures picking senators.&nbsp; This was all designed to instill in man a sense of power while in reality giving none.&nbsp; So, what does this have to do with Iraq and the War you ask?&nbsp;  Well, our fore-fathers took a huge risk.&nbsp; Nobody has made a republic work for very long.&nbsp; First, they had to instill virtues: honesty, integrity, self reliance, and hard work to name a few.&nbsp; However, republics fail because people have a human desire called greed.&nbsp; On the same level, republics work because of the "I have to take care of myself but also acknowledge my fellow man" mentality.&nbsp; To insure the success of said republic, one must avoid apathy, fear, and greed.&nbsp; Ok, that said, I want you to now understand why I think America was doomed&nbsp;to experience an event like September 11th.&nbsp; I'm going to jump ahead a little to what is going on right now though.&nbsp;   Why I think September 11th and other similar events occurred, and will occur in the future.   The answer is plain and straightforward.&nbsp; America is hated in the Arab world.&nbsp; This has been debated over and over again in the media.&nbsp; The question is why do Islamic, Arabic, and Middle Eastern people hate our great country so much?&nbsp; Why is all of our well meaning intent facing the wall of rejection? The answer is out there, but in this time of political correctness nobody dares to utter it.&nbsp; It is the old adage of "the friend of my enemy is my enemy" that works here.&nbsp; And let me remind you that seven Arab countries surrounding Israel fought at least 7 wars against the Jewish state.&nbsp; They still proclaim their goal to be the destruction of the state of Israel.&nbsp; And it is America's complete support of Israel that ensures the country is not wiped off the maps. On one hand, Am. should be praised for being a big brother to Israel and protecting it from bully states.&nbsp; On the other, it can only do so fairly and evenhandedly in respect to Palestinian Arabs, who are an inseparable part of the deal that created Israel.&nbsp;  Irresponsible foreign policies of the Bush Administration, endorsing Israeli aggression and land grabs not only encourage Israel but cause great outrage in the whole Arab world, brewing terrorism and endangering Americans at home and abroad.&nbsp; To us, democracy is the extension of the work of the Founding fathers and centuries-long tradition; to Arabs, democracy is the extension of the order established and revered in the Jewish state.&nbsp; The more words Zionist and American go together in the minds of Middle Eastern people, the more loathing reserved for the former would be poured into us.&nbsp; As outraged as I was with the recent barbaric beheadings of American citizens in Iraq, I have to bring them here as an example of the hatred we are facing.&nbsp;Their aggression represents everything we have imposed, changed, or destroyed in their civilization.&nbsp;  Basically what we do is take countries and send infinite amounts of corporate advisors, giving them advice on how to run their economic systems more efficiently. We inundate them with our&nbsp;media, plugging them with the same MTV and commercials via satellite that we as a culture are so complacent to swallow. We tell them that they are inadequate unless they have some guy's name on their underwear, shoes, sunglasses, and cars. &nbsp;Then we try to re-vamp their economy. Sure, we make it a lot more efficient, but in that same breath we spread our Taco Bells, McDonald's, shopping malls, and fashion sense all over them. People cheer when a KFC goes in the middle of Tiananmen Square because they are one step closer to being complete, one step closer to the American Dream of materialistic completion that we tell ourselves we can't live without.  We homogenize countries to make them more accessible for world trade. Globalization.&nbsp; You can't just blame terrorism on religious fanatical zeal alone. THEY BOMBED THE ECONOMIC PULSE OF THE WORLD. The Thai baht crashed the same time our NASDAQ crashed. We interlinked each other and became interdependent.&nbsp;In the process, we squandered Asian culture in an effort to have their damn economy mirror ours.  Ok, so I think I have thoroughly confused myself as well as my faithful readers (see: none).&nbsp; I will with hold any further comments to allot time for information absorption and dissection.&nbsp;I will come back to the point of republicanism tomorrow night.&nbsp; I promise.

      It's rained pretty good for the last three days.&nbsp;I absolutely love the rain and thunderstorms. My dogs are afraid of thunder, it's the funniest thing to see these two big dogs (a chocolate lab and golden retriever) jumping every time there is a clap of thunder.&nbsp;  I went back over my blog and I need to use more paragraphs, it all looks like one long essay.&nbsp;A little hard to read. Sorry about that.  I can hear my step-mom laughing upstairs with my step-brother.&nbsp;It's a strange sound.&nbsp;I wonder if anybody knows what it feels like to be the unwanted-ok maybe not unwanted but certainly unwelcomed-child.&nbsp;He was gone all last week at a soccer camp at UNC.&nbsp;And, I've noticed this before but more so this time, the step-mom decided to forego any parental or maternal duties for that week. She didn't cook dinner once, she would come home and go straight up to her room without even saying hello, she hardly ever acknowledged my sister or me, and completely closed up.&nbsp; I know it is natural for a step-parent to feel more love towards their own child, but does she have to make it so damn obvious?  I try to do my best to please her, to make her proud of me.&nbsp;I have given her no reason not to be proud of me or to love me. I get good grades, don't drink, smoke, or do drugs, I don't stay out past curfew, my friends are good people, I do my chores more often than not, I clean my room, I shuttle my siblings wherever they want to go, I usually only have to be asked once to do something, and I don't deliberately try to hurt her or my dad with my actions or words.&nbsp;It just seems like I will  never  be good enough for her.&nbsp;Never.&nbsp;Nothing I do or say can change that, I am sub-par and always will be to her.&nbsp;I wonder why my dad married her.&nbsp;The following thought may sound a bit hypocritical so beware.&nbsp;  In all honesty though, I really can't imagine living without her.&nbsp;I think she makes my dad happy and I really love my step-siblings.&nbsp;If I were given the choice of whether or not my parents were to get a divorce, I would probably say no.&nbsp;I love her because she is family (sort of) but I can't stand her otherwise.&nbsp;

      I love Journey.&nbsp; They were a great band.&nbsp; So I sat here for 8 minutes trying to think of something to write.&nbsp; It's not that I don't have things to write about it is just that there is so much that I want to get out it feels overwhelming.&nbsp; I mean, where do I start...the death of my mom, my non-relationship with my step-mom, Sarah, depression, wanting to just leave, college, my feelings, politics, unemployment, love, lack of love, goals, hopes, dreams, feeling unfulfilled and unappreciated.&nbsp; Which of those holds precedence over another.&nbsp; Where do I start? Do I really want to express myself on all of those subjects? Or will that just end up being too hard and ultimately causing more pain than it was worth? Is it better to keep things inside like I have been doing for the past 17 years, or do I start wearing them on my sleeve?&nbsp; I feel like I am walking on a bridge of glass...at any moment everything is going&nbsp;shatter beneath my feet&nbsp;and I will just fall.&nbsp; I think I am only trying to protect myself when I don't express myself.&nbsp; I don't want to get hurt and telling the truth about how I feel could do that.&nbsp; I don't want to write anymore, maybe later.

      I finally organized all my CDs tonight...or excuse me, I guess it would be this morning.&nbsp; It took me about an hour and a half to do it.&nbsp; Granted I was sitting on the couch in front of the TV watching VH1 while doing it so that probably was a little distracting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am really embarassed about some of the CDs I own and hope they never ever see the light of day again.&nbsp; Why did I ever waste my money on that crap?&nbsp; I mean, LFO, come on was that worth 15 bucks?&nbsp; Destiny's Child?&nbsp; In retrospect, I don't think so.&nbsp;  I was hoping to have the house all to myself this weekend due to my step-brother's soccer tournament in Steamboat.&nbsp; But, I guess it was decided that nobody else is going with&nbsp;my step-mom&nbsp;and Cam.&nbsp; I could have used a little alone time.&nbsp; Just me and the dogs.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; I really like my alone time.&nbsp; And I never get any of it other than when I am driving in my car to wherever.&nbsp; Sometimes I would much rather spend time with myself than with other people.&nbsp; Does that make me anti-social?&nbsp; I don't think so because I really do like talking with my friends it's just I am not the type of person who absolutely has to have their friends around at all times.&nbsp; Does that make me a loner?&nbsp; Maybe, but thats ok.&nbsp; I have the best friend anyone could ever ask for and some other pretty good friends too.&nbsp; That's all I need.&nbsp;

      I saw a movie tonight.  "Elephant" was the title.  I am not sure what it has to do with the movie but I suspect it relates to the cliche about trying to ignore the elephant in the room.  Fitting title in my opinion.  It was about a typical high school day and the typical kids who go there.  There was the jock and his girlfriend.  The three bulimic popular girls.  The artsy photographer.  The nerdy misfit.  The crowd drifter whose dad is a drunk.  And the two outcasts with a few things to hide.  This typical day turned out to be pretty abnormal.  All but one of them are killed in a massacre and I am sorry if I ruined the movie...you should still see it, trust me.  Yes, this is another one of those school shooting movies but it should not be compared to the other ones.  It doesn't deserve that sort of degradation.  While the other movies try to pin a cause as to why it happened, this movie just shows what happens.  You decide ultimately what the motivations were or were not.  This movie proves that you will never know a person for who they really are.  Everyone has a secret, some are bigger than others.  Everyone has the potential to do great things as well as the potential to do great destruction.  It is all a matter of what you as an individual choose to do.  What you choose to hold against people.  How you choose to express yourself.  What you embrace and what you push away.  And who you choose to love and hate.  There is no greater influence on a person's life than their own decisions.  It doesn't matter if you grow up in a loving household with both parents or if you have lived in 15 foster homes.  Anything can happen and anything is possible.  Good or bad, right or wrong.  You can do great things or do great destruction.  It is always your own decision and no one else has the responsibility or obligation to make it for you.  And there is no playing the blame game once you have made it.  You made the choice now follow through and accept all consequences.

      So right now I am sitting in front of all my CDs and they are begging me to organize them.  I really should do it, but no.  It can certainly wait.  However, I have had a chance to go back through some of them and listen to some songs I like but haven't listened to in a long time.  A few thoughts:  Lauryn Hill has one of the best voices in the industry. The Dropkick Murphys are a band I would like to party with some day. Whatever happened to Oasis? GOB has definitely gone a little to "pop-punk" for me. No Doubt's  Tragic Kingdom  was rad. The Black crows'  Shake Your Moneymaker  is pretty damn awesome. Alanis Morissette's debut album was her best. Sarah McLachlan makes me cry. I hate all those Now (1- what are we at now...19 or something) albums. Mr. Marley is King. Nobody can do what Nirvana did. Live was better 10 years ago. Ani DiFranco is cool but I get a headache if I listen to her for a long time. The Spice Girls a definite guilty pleasure. Does it get any better than "Stop Right now?" No, no I don't think so.  A while ago I was asked a question that has really bothered me since then.  It is a very simple and unassuming question.  One of those "conversation starters" if you will.  I am sure the lady who asked me the question didn't mean anything by it and she would feel really bad if she found out that it has been plaguing me all this time.  "So, Sam, what do you do?"  That's it...that is the question.  That fucking question.  What do you do.  What do you do.  I told her I was a high school student looking for a job.  But...therein lies the problem, that is not what I do.  I don't know what the hell I do.  I go to school, but that isn't what I  do .  Some people can answer that question with no hesitation because they do something.  They travel the world.  Write books. Help the needy.  Save animals.  Protect rain forests.  Paint pictures. Run marathons.  Anything.  I don't do any of that.  I mean, Jesus, talk about a buzz kill.  Does anyone else feel this way?  Meaning the feeling of being a complete failure at...life.  I should do something...I really really want to do something, anything.  But I don't know what or where to start or how.  The best answer I can come up with right now is that I survive.  That is what I do.  I have survived whatever has come at me in these 17 years the best way I know how.  And a lot has come at me, death, despair, failure, success, sadness, rejection, love, hate, happiness, injustice, inadequacy, depression, angst. Maybe it's human nature to survive but maybe not.  I think that some of us are more well suited to do it than others, I would like to think I am included in the first group.  I guess we'll see how screwed up I am later in life.  By all accounts I should be pretty screwed up, however I don't think I will be.  Wishful thinking?  Maybe, but I don't think so.

      I'm back after a long while of doing...nothing.  I found  urlLink this  really cool website the other day after watching Stand By Me for the first time.  Great movie.  I wrote about my own friends in my personal journal after watching it and I think I'm going to enlighten...well, myself I guess because I'm pretty sure nobody reads this.  Oh well.    I had the best friends of my life at twelve years old.  Lauren, Sarah, and Mel were my everything...my life.  They were my world and I couldn't imagine it without them, until now.  I haven't talked to Mel since I move, but I haven't  really  talked to her since 7th grade or so.  Lauren moved the summer of 6th grade and we haven't spoken since.  Sarah and I are still friends, I consider her my best friend.  But I'm not going to lie to myself anymore...we've grown apart.  We had a lot of fun the four of us, probably more fun than most people can dream of.  We would laugh until we physically just couldn't bear to laugh anymore.  We would talk into the night about anything and everything.  We pounded chicken in Lauren's kitchen as we attempted to cook a "fancy" dinner.  We started a band called SLAMMS, never got around to booking a gig though.  We sang a song about 409 and needing just a little bit more of it.  We started a company in 6th grade to help everyone keep track of their class bucks and we even made credit cards.  Then, we became furious because the boys were copying our idea.  We played basketball and volleyball for the Pioneers, we didn't win much but that didn't matter. I didn't care that Lauren was richer than me, or that Melissa always got better test grades, or that Sarah was a better dancer.  All that mattered is that they could spend the night at my house on Friday and we could go to the movies together on Saturday.  It was that simple.  I remember once when Lauren said she didn't think her parents loved her we all thought that was dumb.  All parents love their kids.  As I look back though, her parents then remind me a lot of my parents now...distant.  She was right I think.  I worry about Lauren the most.  I really really hope she is doing ok...not sad.  I know Sarah is doing well and even without talking to Melissa in 5 or so years I know that she is doing well.  That's just who she is.  We're all going to do amazing things with our lives.  I'm sad that I won't be there to see them do these amazing things, to comfort them when they need it or to be there for them when bad things happen.  However, I am so thankful that these 3 girls were my first real friends...possibly my last real friends.  I owe them a lot but won't ever be able to repay them.  I hope that them knowing they will always always have a friend in me is enough.  Honestly, I am not sure we would have lasted through junior high and high school.  We were brought together for a reason and split up for another.  I-for one-am better because I knew them.

      I saw a really terrible car accident tonight on my way back from Estes Park.  The car was resting on its side in the other lane.  One person, possibly the driver, was laying on the road with his shirt torn and blood on his chest and neck.  Another person was trying to get out of the car through the sunroof, I didn't get a good look at him.  I didn't see the accident so I don't know what happened exactly.  I must have driven by mere minutes after the car overturned.  There were all ready people helping the two guys so I didn't stop.  It scared the hell out of me.  I know that accidents happen everyday but this was bad.  I mean, if either of those guys survive it will be an absolute miracle.  The whole front end of the car was destroyed.  The windshield was shattered and the hood and bumper were smashed down, almost like a boulder fell on the car.  I'll check the paper to see if there is a story on it tomorrow.  I'm dead on my feet tonight, so that's it.

      I get so damn depressed at night. It's the most bizarre thing, after the house gets quiet and the sun goes down its like somebody freaking died. I just feel like I want to cry and assess everything I dislike about myself and how crappy my life is. I will spare you all those thoughts tonight, but eventually I will need to get around to them. Whether we like it or not.  So the family leaves tomorrow night...without me. That's my decision. It is far less excruciating staying here with my grandparents than it is to spend 4 days with my younger siblings and parents. At least when I am at home I can hop in the jeep and drive away. The grandparents have decided to leave Sat. anyway, thank you God.  One last thing before I have to go...well...nowhere, just away. I saw  The Village  the other night and I was soo dissappointed. I absolutely loved  The Sixth   Sense.   Unbreakable  was good overall.  Signs  was nearly unbearable. And  The Village  was just abhorable. It was a waste of my money (read: my dad's money) and my very valuable time (read: I actually had nothing else to do on a Sunday night).

      I am a closet country music fan. I listen to it when I am alone in my car, I secretly watch CMT late at night with the volume down, and I fantasize about cowboys. I grew up listening to country music because both my parents listened to it. I could sing every word to Tim McGraw's "Don't Take the Girl" and absolutely loved anything by Garth Brooks or John Michael Montgomery. My first concert was Joe Duffy at Cheyenne Frontier Days, my second, third, and fourth were John Michael Montgomery, Jo Dee Messina and George Strait. It's probably my Wyoming upraising but whenever I feel depressed I switch to a country music station...since no one reads this, I guess my secret is safe.  I think that I am the type of person who will end up cheating on their spouse, boyfriend, whatever. I read  urlLink this  blog quite often and am completely enthralled and captivated by the lifestyle.  I think it would be thrilling and exciting having two lovers who have no idea about eachother. I don't see anything wrong with it. I suppose that could be a problem in the future.

      I am absolutely livid right now. By far the angriest I have seen myself in a very long time. I need to vent or I am going to break something and there are a lot of valuable items around.  Here is the situation. The family has decided to take a long weekend in Breckenridge. It was decided that we would drive with the camper to Breck and just camp in a campground. Anyway, from pretty much the conception of the idea, I let everybody in the family know that I would not be going on this extended weekend. 4 days confined to a suburban and a camper is not my idea of a good vacation...more like my worst nightmare. Ok, so they are planning on leaving this Friday morning and not coming back until Monday afternoon or evening. That is four good solid days of no chaos, nagging, or familial duties that I need to deal with. Four days all to myself. I  was  looking forward to it.  Here is where I get pissed off. The grandparents have been contemplating moving to Northern Colorado for about 4 months. Well, since the beginning of the summer (June) they have been here a total of 3 separate times, each individually amounting to approximately 5-7 days at our house as guests. They are here right now, and have been since last Tuesday. Even without what I am about to tell you, they are getting on my nerves. They drink all the pop and eat all the cereal and for the first two visits I spent  my  free time trying to entertain  them , and I hate that. They invade my privacy and my space and needless to say I have had it. I am being pushed to the point where all civility, graciousness, and politeness is gone. I go to a friends house or just plain get out of the house, from the time I wake up 'till around 9 o'clock at night, because I know if I talk to them I will say that is  very very  mean.  Here is where I get overwhelmingly and uncontrollably enraged. So, earlier this evening I find out that the grandparents will not be going back to Oregon anytime soon. In fact, they will be staying at our house while the rest of the family is on gone. They will be in MY HOUSE while my family is gone and I was supposed to have it to MYSELF. I want to scream. I want to cry and yell and slam doors and throw things.  I am so incredibly frustrated with them and angry with them. They are guests in my house and they have treated me like a doormat. We have extended our home to them while they search for one of their own and it is time for them to get the hell out of dodge. Don't they have any sense of common decency? A regular person, would not impose on people in the way they have to my family and me. A regular person would understand that a week of staying in someone's house is really pushing it. A regular person wouldn't stay in a vacant house while the occupants are on vacation. Does that seem odd to anyone but me? I am also very angry at my parents for not growing a fucking backbone and telling them that they need to get a hotel room or go back to Oregon, just get out of our damn house.  Here is where I have to make a decision I should never have had to make in the first place if I was a respected member of this household. Do I go on the shitty family vacation or do I put up with the relatives for four days. I was really really looking forward to having time alone to myself for those 4 days because its hard to get time alone when there are 5 people in this house. But, on the same note I really really do not want to spend 4 days with my grandparents. Really really not. I also don't want to be with my family for 4 days in a camper. I need to do some thinkin on this one.  My words may have sounded harsh, but you have to understand where I am coming from. For nearly half of my summer, my grandparents have been here. That is hardly what I would consider a summer vacation. I don't know what I am going to do. Maybe there's a pencil I can snap or a pillow I can scream into nearby.

      I have this  huge  craving for Chinese food right now. If it weren't 2:16 in the AM I would go satisfy my craving, but I can't and I'm pissed because I want me some egg rolls and Kung Pao Beef NOW! Hell.  I had the most exciting day, oh wait I must be confusing my life with someone else's again. Sorry about that. Actually, the day wasn't too bad. Went to the lake, rode some jet skis, sat in a chair on the beach, forgot the sunscreen, have weird sunburn on back of hand. Might take picture of it and post it tomorrow.  I love my dogs more than I love most people. I think it is so cool that Caly's only job in the entire world is to hang out with my other dog, Zeus. Zeus and Caly are what psychologists mean when they talk about unconditional love. I mean, I will go outside for literally less than a minute yet when I walk back in the house they are ecstatic to see me, like it has been a lifetime since I left them. They're always at my foot or hand, waiting to be petted and stroked, played with and talked to. Zeus' huge blocky head and his overgrown puppy body. Caly's paw scratching at you and her ears perked up to hang on your every word. Even though I am sure they don't, it seems like the understand me in ways no human ever could. They keep me company when I'm watching TV, they protect me from the UPS man, they scare away the airplanes by howling at them, and they are forever my afternoon nap buddies. I can honestly say that I wish I was more like my dogs, providing unbridled love and unconditional friendship to whoever gives them a good belly scratch.
