      Hi everyone. this is my blog, and i'm just starting out. I will be talking about things that are on my mind.  Did anyone see the big Dean concession speech in Iowa Monday night?  Wow!!  He probably shouldn't have done that, but i think that it is being blown way out of proportion in the press.

      Well, today the White House released the now famous 8/6/2001 Presidential Security Memo that apparently warned that Osama bin Laden was determined to strike in the US.  It seems that they wanted to sort of cover this up because they released this on a Saturday afternoon on the day before Easter Sunday.  Iraq is still a mess and I think that the June 30 handover of power has to be reconsidered because there is no one to turn power over to and because there is a civil war going on there.

      Well, today, one year after the fall of the Saddam Statue in Baghdad, Iraq is in complete and utter chaos.  It seems that both the Shia and Sunnis are now united, against US!!!  It is being reported that two Americans have now been kidnapped by insurgents, with four Italians.  Then there are a few Japanese who are being held and if Japan doesn't withdraw in a few days, then they will burn them alive.  Anyway, hopefully nothing else happens today.

      BREAKING NEWS:  Israel Strikes  Today the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) struck a car in Gaza that was carrying the new Hamas leader and killed him.  I wholeheartedly support Israel in their struggle against terrorism.  This is great.  *Note:  I would have written this blog sooner but my internet was unfortunately down for a few hours and just went back on.

      Today there was a suicide bombing at a border crossing between Israel and Gaza which has injured 4 Israeli officers.  Israel should just pull out of these Palestinian areas, build a huge wall to separate them, and then just leave the Palestinians to do whatever they want in their own little country.  Then, if something happens in Israel from the Palestinians, Israel should strike back.  The US should back all of this.

      Today there is a new Osama bin Laden tape out, and Secretary of State Colin Powell says that they think its real.  In it he offers a truce to Europe if they pull out of the Mid- East.  In other news, today there is reaction from the Arabs to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon meeting with Bush yesterday and them agreeing to pull out of the Gaza strip completely, Israel retaining some settlements in the West Bank, and not recognizing the "Right of Return" for Palestinian refugees.  I have to say that this is one thing that I agree and support Bush on.  Israel is the only democracy in that region of the world and America needs to support it.

      Well, the President just finished his press conference.  It was ok.  He claims that the fighting in Iraq is just in parts of the country.  He was scared about a question comparing Iraq to Vietnam.  OK, well, I'm really tired now so I'm going to sign off and go to bed soon.  I just hope that I will wake up tomorrow and not see bad news about more dead soldiers or possibly a terrorist attack.

      The 9/11 Commission just finished hearings for the day.  Attorney General Ashcroft was at the end of the day today.  I have to say, the hearings are pretty boring to watch.  There are no, "What did the President know and when did he know it?" type moments.  Bush has his press conference tonight.  He has not been having a good couple of weeks.  I'll update this blog later after the Press conference.

      Apparently Bush is going to have a Prime- Time Press conference tomorrow night at about 8:30 ET.  What is he going to say when he is questioned about the hundreds of troops who have died because of his little misadventure in Iraq?  We'll see tomorrow.

      Today more American soldiers have been killed in Iraq.  The uneasy truce has fallen apart.  Still a mess.  We have to get Bush out of office.  Read Howard Dean's Op- Ed in the NY Times.  Its great.  He says that we all have to fall in line behind Kerry and unite to beat Bush.  Air America radio talks a lot about supporting Kerry too.

      So, today there are reports that a few Chinese Citizens have been taken hostage in Iraq.  Now it seems like they will do anything to anybody.  John Kerry is right that foreign leaders are probably saying that Bush has to be beaten and we need someone as President and leader of the free world and the world's only superpower who actually consults our allies before going into a unilateral war.  Do you remember all the goodwill and support that we received from the rest of the world in the wake of 9/11?  The French newspapers the next day said, "We are all Americans".  They sang the National Anthem all around Europe.  Now the US is seen as a threat to world peace.  Anyway, I'm really mad today, I'll see what tomorrow is like.

      Well, what to talk about today?  Iraq is still a mess, and the administration won't budge from the June 30 handover date.  No one knows who will receive this power.  John McCain was on Meet the Press this morning.  He says that under no circumstances will he run for VP with Kerry.  That is too bad.  A Kerry- McCain ticket would be a lock for victory in November.  Anyway, Bush is about to have remarks on CNN in a couple minutes.  Maybe I'll update you then.

      Well, I'm back again.  Sorry I didn't blog for a few days.  Anyway, today I was reading in my local paper that has a column that people can call into and have their stupid thoughts published in the paper that the public dicourse and debate that is going on in the country is what the terrorists want to see and that electing Kerry would be letting them win.  SHUT UP!!! Wouldn't just going along with the President and the administration let them win and stifle democracy?

      So the world is falling apart and Bush's numbers are going up!!!  Why is this happening?  There is also semi-serious talk about reinstating the draft.  I seriously hope that this doesn't happen.  I'll talk more later.

      Hi, I know that I haven't blogged for a while, I didn't feel like doing it for some reason.  Anyway, the world is still falling apart and Bush and Kerry are dead even in the polls.  What is this business about Kerry's war medals and whether they were medals or ribbons that he threw in DC 30 years ago and whether he deserved them or not?  How can the Bush people even talk about this?  Kerry isn't handling this well though.  He should probably ask the President to show the country his medals from Vietnam.  Oh yeah, he doesn't have any because he didn't even show up to the national guard.  Maybe if Bush had served he would know about Medals and ribbons.  This just shows that Bush can't run on the issues and has to go on what Kerry threw in 1971.        I'm also very angry about the flip- flop issue.  Both Bush and Kerry have flip- flops.  In the '70s, when Bush ran for Congress, he was pro- choice.  In 2000, he said he was against "nation building" and what is he doing now?  He was also against the Department of Homeland Security, and has opposed funding for anti- terrorism measures.  The Democratic Party is THE Party of National Security and they should really expose the Republicans for who they really are.  I am so mad today, I feel like Howard Dean!!!!  PS-   Oh, I have a new catchphrase, Clinton screwed an intern, but Bush screwed America.

      *New Mid-East Solution*  I've come up with a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Israel is always pressured to give up land that it won in the 1967 Six Day War to the Arabs.  I think that all of the surrounding countries and Israel should give up some land for a Palestinian state.  Egypt could give up some of the land in the Sinai Peninsula.  Jordan could cede some land bordering on the West Bank, most of which would be given up by Israel, with the exception of settlements on the border on the Green Line which have now become legitimate suburbs of large Israeli cities.  I  think that this could be a viable solution to this urgent and pressing crisis.

      Hi.  There are new photos out from Iraqi Prisons.  They are horrible.  Who knows what else could come out soon from this scandal.  It seems that Bush now has his own sex scandal on his hands, but this one involves some pretty weird stuff.  This is from the guy who said that he would restore honor and dignity to the Oval Office.  I just read that he is going to  make a prime-time speech on Monday night.  Its going to be about Iraq.  Yesterday the US raided the compound of Ahmad Chalabi, who took us into this war and was being paid by the Pentagon up until a few days ago.  Now he is denouncing the US administration there and is pushing for full sovregnity for Iraq.  This is the guy who said that we would be welcomed in Baghdad with flowers and candy.  It now has been revealed that he was spying for Iran.  He could have given them secrets that led to the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq.

      Have you seen the new polling numbers from Newsweek?  I have and they're good, very good.  They show Kerry leading Bush by about 5 points.  It's good that Kerry has been rather quiet over the past couple weeks as this prisoner abuse thing has erupted.  They say not to interfere with your opponent while they are self- destructing.  The war will definitely be the issue of this election.  As long as Kerry doesn't say anything, the Repubicans like Sean Hannity and Rush can't accuse him of turning this into a political issue, which I believe he should be able to do anyway because Bush is the President and the Buck stops at the Oval Office desk.  Okay, I'll talk to you soon.

      The Greatest President  I am sitting here watching former President Clinton speak live on C-SPAN.  He is just amazing.  He really knows what he is talking about and has deep thoughts (unlike some other people we know).  I think that he was America's Greatest President.  He brought a new hope to this country and optimism.  He worked for the job, it wasn't handed to him.  He was just a poor kid from Arkansas who grew up to be a 2-term President.  It is moments like this when I hate term limits.    "There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America."-  President William Jefferson Clinton

      Reagan, Reagan, Reagan  Last week was one of the worst weeks to watch cable news for a long time.  You just couldn't escape the coverage of Reagan's death and funeral.  Why was everyone so shocked that a 93 year old man died?  He was 93!!!  The media was also saying how great he was and talking about the great legacy that he left the country and the world.  Yeah, good job Mr. President, you left us with an ensuing recession, a huge, unprecendented defeciet (that is, before President Dubya), a polarized nation, and so much more.  Unemployment was up to 10% during one point of his term.  Ok, well at least that is all over now and we can move on.

      *WOLFOWITZ BLAMES THE PRESS FOR BAD NEWS FROM IRAQ*  A few days ago, testifiying before a Senate Committee, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz blamed the press in Baghdad for not reporting good news coming out of Iraq.  He said that journalists were scared to travel out of their hotel rooms (Hey, I wonder why they would be scared to travel out of their hotel rooms?) and that they were just reporting rumors, of which there are many.  He has now  urlLink He has now apologized for his remarks after being denounced by American journalists including CNN's Aaron Brown and Maureen Dowd of the New York Times.  This is just another example of the Bush Administration blaming others for their horrible mistakes.

      ***COUNTDOWN TO HANDOVER***  Iraq is going to be handed over officially from the "Coalition of the Willing" (mainly the US, UK and a few other tiny countries) to the new Iraqi Interim Government on June 30 which is in about 5 days now.  This morning there were car bombings all over the country and I believe that the count is now about 100 dead and many more wounded.  What is going to happen next week when they are basically on their own?  We will just have to wait and see.

      Well, what talk about today?  First of all there is the book by the greatest President of the 20th century, if not in all of American history, Bill Clinton, the last elected president of the United States.  How many interviews have been on in the last few days?  Did you see the  urlLink BBC Interview ?  He apparently got a little angry about the Ken Starr investigation and how the media let Starr abuse his power.  The conservative pundits on cable (especially FOX NEWS) are having a field day.  Last night I was watching "HANNITY and colmes" (that's the way the show seems to be run, anyway) and Sean Hannity was saying how the leaders of the Democratic Party are going crazy (Howard Dean, Al Gore, and now Bill Clinton).    What else is going on?  John Kerry is going to pick his running mate in a few weeks.  I think that he is going to pick North Carolina Senator John Edwards.  He's basically an innocent Bill Clinton.  He is young, southern, charismatic, and from the south.  He would be able to run for President in 2012, when Kerry's time would be up.  I really think that Edwards will be the Veep.  I guess we will see in a few weeks if I am right or wrong.

       ***BREAKING NEWS***  **US TRANSFERS POWER TO IRAQ 2 DAYS AHEAD OF JUNE 30 DEADLINE**   This morning, at about 2:30 Eastern Time, the US officially transfered power to the new Iraqi Interim Government.  This was reportedly done to catch the terrorists off guard so that they couldn't attack during the ceremony.  It is still unknown if this will make a large difference since there are still thousands of American troops over there, and the US will still have to deal with the security of Iraq.  We will have to wait to see how this all turns out.

      *BREAKING NEWS*  The Senate has voted against continuing debate about the Constitutional Amendment banning Gay Marriage.  The vote was 48-50, with Senators Kerry and Edwards absent.  60 votes were needed to continue the debate.  The issue is now dead for the rest of the term.  This is a great move and defeat of the Christian right and now the Senate can move on to more important matters concerning the American People.

      **THE GAY MARRIAGE DEBATE**  It is 11:33 and the Senate vote on the marriage amendment is set for about 30 minutes from now.  This is going to fail miserably and the crazy Christian Right will have to go pick on another group of people.  Aren't they supposed to be for states' rights?  I guess states don't have rights if it goes against the GOP.  They also complain about activist judges going against the will of the people.  What about Bush v. Gore in 2000 with activist judges ruling against states' rights and going against the will of the people.    Ok, well, i'll be back after the Senate vote to respond to it.

      *The Discussion about postponing the election and much more*  Now there is a lot of talk about postponing the election if there is a terrorist attack right before the election.  The first thing that is wrong is that the Government cannot stop a terror attack.  It has been almost 3 years since 9/11 and by the election it will be more than that.  What have they been doing for the last 3 years?  Aren't they supposed to be protecting us from attacks.  I believe that it is in the Constitution.  The Preamble of the Constitution states that the government is formed in part to "provide for the common defense..."  Republicans are supposed to be the party of law and order and national security and defense party.  Now they are basically saying that they have no idea what is going on.  My second problem is that we would be giving into the terrorists that we are fighting.  During the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said that if they delayed or otherwise interfered with the Presidential Election of 1864, that it would give the rebellion a victory.  Not even in the midst of a civil war was the election altered, except in areas where there was fighting going on.  We are supposed to be fighting for freedom and democracy in this war against terrorism, and by postponing the election we would show that we are weak and that the terrorists have found a way to hinder the democratic process.  I don't think that we would be able to make fun of the French anymore about being weak on terror, it would be us that is weak.  The Spanish didn't change their election a few days after the Madrid train attacks on 3/11, the governing party went on with the elections as planned and lost the election.

      Election 2004  Well, last Tuesday it was announced after weeks of intense secrecy by the Kerry campaign that John Edwards would be the Vice- Presidential candidate for the Democratic ticket.  I think that this is a great move by Kerry.  Edwards will help Kerry in parts of the South and in other rural areas where Kerry would otherwise be weak.  Kerry and Edwards have a very good chance of winning the election and I would put my money on them right now.  Swing voters tend to go to the challenger and Kerry is either winning or tied with Bush in almost all of the polls.  It looks very good for Kerry right now and I think that we will have a Democratic Administration a year from today.  Just remember, Don't stop thinking about tomorrow!

      I have a problem with the way that this campaign is being waged by both sides. The campaigns are ignoring most states and are just focusing on the fickle states that can't seem to make up their minds over who they want to vote for. They ignore their base states and I think that it leaves many voters in those states feeling left out of the process because the focus isn't on them. I live in CT and today we were supposed to have a Kerry- Edwards campaign stop today. Instead, the bus caravan went right through the state to Pennsylvania. The big story was that some spotted the bus on its way through. I have also discovered that the campaigns are not willing to spend any money at all in states like mine. I was at a fair today and worked at the democratic booth. We had no material from the Kerry campaign and that is what a lot of people were looking for today. I think that the candidates should campaign in all 50 states and not just appeal to the 5 stupid people in Ohio who can't make up their minds. Who are these people? I do not understand how you can be undecided in this election. These people probably aren't going to vote in the end and they should just be written off because they pay no attention to this election at all and time and money shouldn't be wasted on them at the expense of others who would like to participate more in the process.  My other problem is with the early primary states full of people who don't know who to vote for. These people mainly live in Iowa and New Hampshire. These people practically have the candidates making their breakfast and taking out their garbage every day but they still can't make up their mind. They get the privilege of deciding who the nominee for each party is going to be and they are very indecisive. I hate these people sometimes. How is it that party members in every other state seems to be able to make up their minds yet these stupid farmers in New Hampshire and Iowa can't. Why do we keep indulging these people?

        ***DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION***       &nbsp;  Yesterday's primetime speeches were very good.&nbsp; I thought that Teresa Heinz Kerry's speech was good but too long.&nbsp; It droned on and on.&nbsp; Howard Dean was great.&nbsp; I loved his parts of the speech that went back to what he was saying during the primaries.&nbsp; He said that everyone there spoke for the "Democratic wing of the Democratic Party."&nbsp; He did his little "You have the power!" thing, which I think is a sort of magic spell that he casts.&nbsp;    The big speech of the night was Illinois Senate Candidate Barak Obama.&nbsp; He spoke of a united America, not a divided one.&nbsp; It was just amazing.&nbsp; He is going to be the next US Senator from Illinois because there is no Republican running from there anymore after Jack Ryan dropped out because of a sex scandal.&nbsp; He is a rising star in the Democratic Party and may be the first Black President.&nbsp;   I'll be back later today after John Edwards' acceptance speech.  PS:&nbsp;&nbsp; I read that  urlLink http://http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/27/politics/main632296.shtml &nbsp; Nader is planning to crash the party in Boston by trying to get in as a journalist.&nbsp; He should only show up there if he is going to announce that he is dropping out and supporting John Kerry.&nbsp; If he goes in there the delegates will try to kill him.&nbsp; I wonder if Al Gore is still there.

        ***DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION***        &nbsp;   New York Senator and former First Lady Hillary spoke last night at the Democratic National Convention introducing former President Bill Clinton.&nbsp; She was positive and spoke well of the Democratic nominee.&nbsp;    Ok, now that we got that part done, lets move on to the big speech of the night, Bill Clinton.&nbsp; When he walked out onto the stage, the room seemed to just light up.&nbsp; He was smiling and just great.&nbsp; It is moments like this that I wish we didn't have term limits.&nbsp; His speech was also very supportive of Kerry.&nbsp;   *I will be back tonight to respond to the night's big speeches.

        ***DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION***       &nbsp;  Former President Jimmy Carter finished his speech to the delegates at the Democratic National Convention&nbsp;in Boston a little while ago.&nbsp; It was a great speech.&nbsp; It was rousing, critical, and inspiring to the Democratic Party.&nbsp; He was a lot more critical of Bush than Gore was.&nbsp; I will be back in a half hour or so to respond to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Former President Bill Clinton with their speeches.

        ***DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION***     &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a little bit into the big speeches of the first night of the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp; the rightful President of the United States, Al Gore, spoke at about 8 ET.&nbsp; He delivered a great speech.&nbsp; It war rousing, respectful, and inspiring.&nbsp; He joked a little bit in the beginning about the 2000 election and the recounts.&nbsp; He mentioned the word "Bush" only once.&nbsp; He laid out the case for Bush's re- defeat.&nbsp; All in all, it was a good speech.&nbsp; We are now waiting for former President Jimmy Carter in about 10 minutes.  *I will come back to blog later in the night and throughout the week to give my thoughts.

      Many have been saying that they were surprised that Kerry didn't get much of a bounce from the DNC last week.  He didn't get much of a bounce probably because there was nothing to bounce to.  Only about 10% if that of the voting population are undecided, and those people probably won't vote in the end anyway.   urlLink http://http://www.slate.com/id/2104745/  Go here to see a credible person talking about how the polls are good for Kerry.  I would bet that Kerry will win and will probably win by a fairly large margin, maybe 5%.  That is a lot for this election.  Most of the undecideds will go for the challenger, Kerry.  Kerry victory in November.

      I really do not like one "Democratic" Senator.  Zell Miller of Georgia, says that he is a Democrat and he is leading the GOP coalition group "Democrats for Bush".  He is  NOT    a Democrat.  You can see the transcript from his interview with Tim Russert  urlLink http://http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5574180/  here.  He is against a woman's right to choose, he is for the Marriage Amendment, and he is against Gun control, just to name a few things.  He fully supports the War in Iraq and has complains about how the Democratic Party has gone too far to the left for him.  He says that it has changed.  Well Zell, things have changed since the 1950's!!!  You are a Republican!!!  Just switch parties and get it over with.  The Republican party has also changed because issues and situations change.  Communism isn't an issue anymore.   If you want an example of flip-flopping,  just look at Senator Miller.  He delivered the keynote address at the 1992 Democratic National Convention that nominated Bill Clinton.  He supported Al Gore in 2000 and in 2001 spoke about Senator Kerry in very kind words.  He should leave the Party now because we don't want him.
