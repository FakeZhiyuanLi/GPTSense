      So maybe this whole leaving thing is hitting me a little hard today. I woke up at 5am because I stayed at Mike's last night. I walked up the hill and sweated like a pig, as usual. My English Club was throwing me a farewell party, so at 10:00AM sharp, I was standing outside the English Club room with my (nasty) brownies and cookies. I opened the door and a few pops and streamers flew by me. The seven members of the English Club and Arita-sensei had decorated the room with streamers and balloons. They had brought in snacks and laid them out on the table. In the back, were hand drawn pictures of yours truly (some of them extremely flattering, I must say). It was the nicest thing ever. Then, they sang me a song in English. Then they gave me some lyrics in romanji of "Only One" by SMAP. So I sang with them (wasn't very good). After that, one of my favorite students, Daiki, gave a speech in English. It was so good! When he was finished, he started to cry. Now, mind you, he is ikkasei, so maybe 11 years old. But he screwed up his face a little and started to cry a little bit. So then I started to cry. Then Arita sensei started to cry. It is the first time I cried in front of the Japanese people. I had thought I wouldn't but there I was, blubbering away.  All those times you feel so left out, out of the loop...well the whole time you were actually in the loop. Some of the students admire you. They want to talk to you. You are a kind of celebrity. I know that I can't speak their language well, but to know that I can impact students just by being my goofy self in class makes me feel really loved. People don't say what they mean here and are usually timid when it comes to sharing their feelings. I didn't know if people would care if I left but...maybe they do?  I am embarrassed to be the center of attention at school. A lot of people like it but I got to the point where I was so cynical about people looking at me, touching me, making comments...that I just thought I was some kind of animal. I wish I could have understood more about why they do it...and their real feelings behind it all. I am feeling a bit emotional (as usual) about the situation that just occured. I realize I will never see these kids again and wow, my heart really breaks. I hate saying goodbye. I wish I could be more articulate at this moment so everyone would break down and crywhen reading this. Zannen.

      I have given up on the whole link thing. I tried to do what Jo said but it seems to not work with me. Am I that stupid?  I walked up the hill this morning, a sweating, smelly beast, lumbering into the teacher's room. By 8:30AM I wondered why in the hell I even bothered to take a shower.  I also had to go back to my apartment today to have the owner of my apartment check it out. It was just to make sure I hadn't had any wild parties and burned the tatami, or that I wasn't hiding a refugee in the broom closet. Regardless, the owner said all was clear. I went with my supervisor. I am thinking he has some sort of split personality. Sometimes he is super nice. He can be really friendly. Another day, he is distracted, not as friendly, and really distant. I wonder, at these times, if i somehow offended him. It is quite unnerving.  I have some really good news to share. My parents broke down and they bought a dog. I think it was for me. I was talking to my dad on the phone last night when I heard some tiny 'ruff ruffs!' I asked my dad what that was. He said, uh, the neighbor's dog. Since I am aware that the neighbor's dog is around 70lbs, unless he had some private parts cut off, that was not that dog. So my dad broke down and told me. Yay!!! He is a puppy! I can't wait to meet him.  Isn't that a heartfelt moment? Last night, I had dinner with my illegal private class. They had this awesome dinner and gave me some big gifts...which I can't take home. It is more than some people gave me at this school so I am thinking I should have given them something more. Isn't that how it always works out? Like, I should have gave the super nice tie I bought for my supervisor and used that money to buy something that theywould really appreciate? My supervisor gave me a really blank stare when I gave him the tie, like what in the hell is this? I don't know if it is that he doesn't understand the concept of gifts or thankfulness, maybe he needs to watch the ABC special on being  thankful that is on on Thanksgiving. Damn, I wish I could go back in time.

      I will write a poem for you all. It is called, 'Oh, I am tired.' Oh, I am tired At my small and uncomfortable desk I am sleepy, I am snoozing On a mound of mess Sometimes I wish for the comforts of home Where it wasn't so hot and sunny But then I realize That I wasn't making this much money To sit and pick my nose And occasionally bat my eye Once, I started to drool on my desk And almost ate a fly. I fill my time with activities That seem to be so long Then I realize 5 minutes have passed By the sound of the big clock's gong Oh ALT's, your job is different Than any I have ever known To do little work and make money And write really bad poems I am sorry if this poem really sucks And that the lyrics aren't that deep But unfortunately, if I didn't write it I would almost certainly be asleep.

      Can anyone tell me how to put in links to other people's blogs? I am very confused.

      Yes, thanks to my lovely toaster oven, my brownies are now like small hockey pucks. Intending to use them for a dinner party, they are instead used as small unidentified objects ready to break teeth on command.  What in the hell happened? Well, I will tell you. I put those little f-ers in, and they were all gooey. So, I turned up the heat. (Duh! Einstein!!!) Anyway, the top of them began to burn. I took them out, scraped off the burned part and saw gooey stuff inside. I then put the rest of the mix on top of it and cooked it again. In efforts not to burn them, I took them out and allowed to cool. According to the instructions, "If you can stick a fork through the brownies and there is no sticky brownie goo on your fork, you are good to go." Well, I did that. Unfortuantely, the brownies stuck to the bottom of the glass bowl and i lost half of them in the battle to unleash them from said bowl.  Woe is me!!!!! That oven is about as good as the damn Easy Bake Oven I had when I was 10. At least it cooked the brownies/cookies throughly.  Tomorrow, instead of brownies, I will be buying something at the Seamall. I will be eating the funky brownies. I am sure they can't taste that bad, they just look like small terds.  I also learned a new word today, from my brother. It is called "foff." it means F^&amp;* OFF. But you must put it together in efforts to have a confusing effect on people.

      The air-conditioning was not turned on until 10:47 today. I know because I looked on the clock that was on my neighbor's desk. On that clock is also the temperature and humidity. I bet you don't want to know what they were.  Yeah, it is hot. I could complain until my face turned blue (or bright red, the color it is now after walking up that damn hill...) I can sit for hours with my friends in Japan discussing how hot it is, hot as hell, hot as a pancake, hot as shit on a skewer...whatever definition you would like to attach to the all encompassing word that we feel each day as we trudge to work... I no longer get ready for work. Why should I? All I do is sit on my bootie in the teacher's room and notice how long it takes for it to get numb.  On a more interesting note, I did receive a few hundred hankerchiefs as going away presents. Don't&nbsp; get me wrong, I love to blow my nose, but I only have use for so many hankerchiefs. Is there a sign in the store that says, `For foreigners exiting the country, please by this gift only` ? Just wondering.  Sorry for all the sarcasm. It isn't good to be cynical. I actually do have some good news today. I went to the bank with Haramoto sensei to close my bank account. I couldn't believe that it was a year since I came in there in all my sweating glory to open the account. This time, I was relaxed and at least aware of what was about to happen to me. At that time, I was wearing black pants, a long sleeved white shirt and a black suit jacket in the sweltering heat while Haramoto sat next to me in a nice sundress.  Again, I have come a long way. I cursed myself in the bank for not going to travel after leaving here. I mean really, what do I have to do at home? (Other than spend way too much money on shoes and pants and bras????)  Thanks bloggers for writing back. I like to feel the love.  Selene, I am sorry I mentioned the white gloves. I didn't know it was sensitive. Abra, please get me some white driving gloves as I want to maintain sanity and UV rays while driving in my car.

      I would like to know why I come into the office everyday and do nothing. I totally understand that I am getting paid to be here, yadayada, but damn, it is the most boring thing I have ever experienced.  I don't think that I am alone. The teachers here, running, organizing, filing, yelling 'Hai' when appropriate...they don't have that much to do either. In their minds, they are as bored as me but they don't pull out a trashy novel to read because their mind is unsettled. They talk, they act busy, they answer the phone in an exasperated 'irrashaimasuka.' All of these ploys to trick the foreigner into thinking that they have important business to take care of. Then again, maybe I am wrong.  Unfortunately, such contemplation does not make me any less bored or less willing to read my trashy novel. Luckily, Abra and Jo have introduced me to blogging and now I might be addicted. Why didn't i start this earlier? It is very therapeutic.  Besides the facts that every sweat pore in my body is working overtime, I am also wishing I could lay down in the 'secret' sleep room in the back of the school.  Don't get me wrong...I enjoyed my time here but sometimes you can cut the boredom with a knife.  I have one question left to be pondered by my other blogsters. I saw it on my walk to school this morning. Why do Japanese people where white gloves when driving (and during other activities?)

      Those seats inside the JR trains are really short. I mean, I am not that tall, yet my head towers over the beige and sometimes poo-colored seats like the Sta-Puff Marshmellow man over Chicago(?) in Ghostbusters.  All joking aside, I tore my eyes away from my book that I am currently obsessing over to look around the train. I usually keep my eyes averted at all costs hoping that I don't A) Find a Japanese person staring at me in horror, interest, and mystification or B) Finding that person wanting to talk to me.  Above the seats sprouted 6 black-haired heads poking out from the top of the seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;What did my head look like in this field of jet-blackness? A large, reddish-blondish-brownish (thank you hair stylist) sweat-ified, tall&nbsp;head popping out from all of the&nbsp;sameness?&nbsp;  Instantly, having one of my intensified and introspective thoughts that have been paying me visits in the past couple weeks, I asked myself, what in the hell am I doing here? Why do I feel like I have been here forever, yet not been here at all?  Maybe that is confusing. You see, I thought a year was a long time when I arrived here. I thought that if i didn't constantly keep myself busy I might go insane and never fulfill my life-long dream of watching the entire Sex and the City series in chronological order. But somehow, those days were filled, sometimes with interesting stories, sometimes with loneliness...but those days always finished. At the same time, I started to feel like I had been here forever. The feelings of being watched, stared at, scrutinzed...they all became a part of my daily routine, along with confusion.  I walked off the train and thought more deeply about my situation (albeit almost running over a small lady with a suitcase). I got on my bike and rode slowly home.&nbsp; I don't know if I have really let myself feel the sadness of leaving, of closing a chapter in my life. When I arrived back in my neighborhood I cried. I cried with sadness, with thankfulness, with&nbsp;regret, at satisfaction, for the times I wished I could be at home and for the times I was so happy I was here. I didn't know whether to laugh, hug myself, cry madly, or scream...but all seemed to be&nbsp;present at that moment. At times, I am sure I might have Terrets. I guess it is hard to explain personal revelations, but the only question that came to my mind tonight was, "How in the hell did I make it?" In fact, I said it out loud. Self-conscious, paranoid, worried&nbsp;Shelli, had&nbsp;made it. Through a year. When I left Ohio, my sister wrote me a letter that said, "I hope you don't go crazy being there by yourself. I know how you are." My mom had told me, "You can't even do&nbsp;teaching plans for your lessons without freaking out. Why do you think you can live in Japan?" Fine words of encouragement. I know they love me and they do know me best. But I made it. By myself. Who would have thought? I ended the night by dropping the bike on my foot, still crying, and scaring some Japanese people around me. Big, goofy, white person. What is it like to be different? What was it like to be the only natural brown/blond person on a train? I had never known until I came to Japan.

      Last. This is the last blog I will ever write at this office. This is the last attempt for me to appear busy at the computer, while all the while doing nothing. This is the last attempt to speak Japanese and listen attentively while not really understand what REALLY happened. This is the last time to watch the Japanese teachers run around the teacher's room in a frenzy. This is the last time I sweat profusely while doing nothing. This is the last time I knock people over to get to the bathroom in hopes of getting the Western style toliet. This is the last time I bow to people. The last time I say Ohayo Gozaimasu. The last I pray for the clock to go to 4PM.  Yeah, there are a lot more lasts, but do I really need to get all sappy at the computer? The people here have been so nice, nicer than they should have been. I ma so thankful for getting the opportunity to be here. We only get one chance to get away, before we are tied down by family...eventually...I couldn't have asked for a better experience.... Iijo desu. That's all, folks.

      I have been pondering life, as one does before leaving a country they spent a year in, and I have come up with some questions and comments. What was our purpose in coming here? What did I learn while here? Why do humans, when they get something they want, not want it anymore? How do you know if you really love someone? Are we all just too idealistic? I don't think I have the answers to all of them, however, number 2 is pretty easy. I learned many things while in Japan.  1. Don't eat unidentified fish. 2. Don't leave your laundry in the machine, as it will mold.  3. Don't leave things in the back of your fridge. 4. Don't leave your toliet handle up because the top sink will overflow on your floor. 5. Be patient. Even if you are trying to get your point across, make sure you listen to others. 6. Try to take your time. 7. Don't get upset by little things, like missing a train. 8. Wear two shirts in the summer. You sweat a lot. 9. The kids aren't mean. Just because you don't know what they are saying, doesn't mean they are talking about you. In fact, they probably like you. 10. Try not to find a boyfriend here. You just have to say goodbye in the end.  I can't answer the other questions. It might be years until I can completely sort out what the hell this time here did to me. I may need to see a psychologist in that time. But honestly, leaving here is harder than i imagined. I had dinner with my neighbor on friday night and we both were crying at dinner. When I cry here, I try to hold it back, but it hurts my head, so then it comes out. Then my nose is stuffy for a couple hours and sometimes I can't speak. This is why I don't want to do it, but unfortunately, it happens quite frequently.  I am not good with goodbyes. I don't like the feeling of ends, of goodbyes forever, the feeling that maybe you won't see that person ever again. You can't be in this moment again, you can't feel the same, you can't experience the same things. That hurts me more than anything.  A friend told me that you can't stop life. You can't stop pain, death, or sickness. You can't help that bad things happen, or that you make the wrong decisions and you want to go back. Well, dammit, I want to. I want to stop time.  I know this is a bunch of garble, but it is my blog so I can write whatever I want.  Everytime I read a card from one of my students, say goodbye to someone, see something for the last time, I seem to tear up. It is like perpetual PMS. Right now, I want to go back and fix things. I want to make this experience perfect. I want to make my time with my boyfriend perfect and untainted. I want to erase the times I was frustrated with people. I just don't want to remember it with flaws.
