      I went with Michael, Mike, Caleb, Charlene, Laura and Cathy today to see Spiderman 2.  I really enjoyed it alot.  I'm not sure if its better than the original or not but it was a good movie anyway, and it set up nicely the nice one in the franchise.  Storm of Chaos officially begins tomorrow so that is cool.  Hopefully I can log in a few wins for my side.  I'm not holding my breath though.

      I'm back home visiting my dad for the next couple days.  I have to work on Wedensday but I'm going to just wait and head back to Montgomery then.  I showed my brother Ashton  urlLink City of Heros  and now he wants to get it so he can join me and Upchurch in our quest to save the world.  I also helped my dad install the new thermostat controls for the house.  Don't worry, no one was electricuted thank God.  I had hoped to sleep in late today and catch up on all the sleep I have missed out on because of work this week but that plan fell apart today.  Caleb didn't bother to find or ask anyone to take him to work this morning so he waited until 10 minutes before he had to be in and woke me up to take him.  He KNOWS that I haven't had but maybe 7 hours sleep over the last few days but he woke me up anyway.  Of course I'd get more sleep anyway if he would stop staying up all damn night on his computer.  He is what I would call a loud typer.  It's probally his keyboard's fault for the noise but he types fast and hits it hard and that makes a lot of noise which equals no sleep for me.  Oh well, at least I may be able to catch up on my sleep while I am visiting home.  I can't wait till Thursday cause we are going to see Spiderman 2.  That's gonna be great.  Then there is also Thursday Night Drinking club and of course the 4th is this weekend.   Maybe I can find something to do on the 4th that will be fun and not involving me sitting around by myself.

      My day started at 5am this morning.  Fun, you say?  Not as much as you would be led to believe.  It really wasn't bad I guess.  I had two drop offs for the freshmen orientation program and was done by 9am.  I came back to the apartment and put together my regement of Night Goblins, three fanatics, and my Rock Lobber.  Then I went with Michael over to Visions to play a 1000 point game of Warhammer, his Skaven vs my Orcs and Goblins.  The game was really close but I made some errors and forgot some things I could do and that came back to hurt me in the end.  Tonight I went with Cathy over to see Robin and John whom are house sitting for one of the ladies that Robin works for.  We ordered some pizzas and watch Daddy Daycare, which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  WE then got into a discussion on what the problems are with Huntingdon and what could be done to fix them.  Oh and the house we were at was cool.  The owners are Tolkien fanatics and owned all the books, and had several of the replica swords from the Lord of the Ring movies and other cool looking swords.  They also had several interesting books on the Knights Templar that I wish I could have read.  Oh well.  Tomorrow I'm off to visit home and to hang out and take care of business, but I should be back here Wedensday cause I have to go to work.  I'm not going to last much longer so I am probally going to bed soon.  That would be good considering I've had maybe 7 hours sleep in the last 2 days.  Yep, my bed is defintly calling my name....

      I had a bad day at work.  I'm not going to go into that here though.  I have to be at work at 6am and I've decided that since I haven't been able to fall asleep at night I'm going to just stay up and take a nap when I get back from work at 10am.  That way I can be ready to go bowling Saturday night with Cathy, Robin and John.  Tomorrow should be interesting.

      Michael and I bought  urlLink   City of Heros    yesterday and it so far has been awesome!  We created our characters to look like those from Naruto.  Mine in Finwe, and looks like Naruto and Michaels is Kimer who looks like Sasuke.  We have been untouchable so far.  It looks like we finally have found the game for the summer.  If anyone else is thinking about playing this game, then do it!  We are on Victory server so look us up and join up with us for some bad guy ass kicking.

      Today was one long day.  I only got 3 hours sleep last night because of the party and waking up two hours before I was suppose to get ready for work.  I couldn't go back to sleep so I got up after awhile and went on to work early.  9 hours later I returned to the apartment, ate some dinner, Chinese yummy, and then played raquetball.  I did remember to call dad this morning and wish him a happy father's day.  Oh and I learned why not to drink on an empty stomach last night.  All I had yesterday to eat was a bowl of ramen and some popcorn, and then at the party I had 5 shots of Jack and about half a shot of rum, which was all there was left at the time.  I didn't have a hangover this morning or anything, the alchohol just hit me fast last night than it did last time.  So with that lesson learned, I'm gonna make sure to eat some dinner before I meet Cathy and Robin Thursday night for Thursday night drinking club.  We're going over to Cathy's place to drink some and watch a movie or something.  I haven't talked to either about it so I don't know what we are doing for sure yet.  I'll probally be the last to know, but oh well. Same old same old.

      Welcome to my new web journal!  I am Trey Wingard, age 24, single and very availiable, and a recent graduate of Huntingdon College with a degree in English and a minor in History.  I am currently living in Montgomery,AL and working at Huntingdon College in the dining hall as a supervisor, and hopefully in the next month I will be promoted to Assistant Manager.  I enjoy watching movies, with  urlLink Star Wars  and the  urlLink Lord of the Rings  being my favorites.  I also love reading the Star Wars novels and other works of Tolkien, as well as other sci-fi and fantasy novels.  I love watching anime, with my favorites being,  Naruto ,  Fullmetal Achemist, Monster, Fullmetal Panic, Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Neon Geneisis Evangalion, and Tenchi Muyo .  I currently am playing Warhammer, which is a miniature game where you buy, build, paint and play.  I have two full armies, Hordes of Chaos and Beastmen, and have started a third, Orcs and Goblins.  I am planing on selling my two full armies at the end of the summer once Storm of Chaos is done with so I can use the money to put toward building a new computer.  By the way, Storm of Chaos is a worldwide campaign designed by the company that puts out the models, call  urlLink Gamesworkshop .  I will be getting an apartment by meself in the fall, which will be fully furniced thanks to Cathy!  I am taking her apartment when she goes back to school to live with Robin.  I guess that is all for now, though if you want to know anything else about me that I haven't meantioned or don't meantion in my updates, let me know and I will answer any questions you have.  Now it's time for some lunch and then off to Visions to play some Warhammer with the gang!

      Wow it's been a long week.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally the cheerleader camp is over and gone and I can relax some this weekend before another one comes to town on Monday.&nbsp; I played Michael yesterday in a 2000 point Warhammer game, Skaven vs Chaos.&nbsp; I came within one point of making it a draw, and earlier on it looked like I might win out right.&nbsp; One of these days Upchurch, one of these days....&nbsp; Anyway I was afraid I was going to have to move back home because I wasn't going to be able to afford to live here in Montgomery but John Thornhill is going to move in with me so now I can stay.&nbsp; Moving back home wasn't going to be a bad thing, I just wanted to take the finaical troubles off of my dad since he is helping me with paying off stuff.&nbsp; Tonight is Upchurch's 21st birthday party, so that should be interesting.&nbsp; Then tomorrow it's off to the nearest Gamesworkshop store to play in the nation wide campaign games for this week.

      I just don't know what to do anymore.  I don't like my job but I don't have anywhere else I can go to at the moment.  I hate being alone, not having someone that loves me and that I love.  I'm in debt up to my eyeballs and I'm barely making ends meat.  This really sucks. Blah.

      I went with Upchurch and Caleb to see King Aurther tonight, and it was pretty good.  It's nothing like the legends, but it's suppose to be based more on the actually person.  A different approach for the subject, but it worked well.  I played Michael in a game of Warhammer today and lost utterly but I was suppose too.  We were play testing some army lists for him and I think he found that he likes what he saw.  I bought a copy of the Witch Hunter Codex for Warhammer 40K today while I was over at Visions.  That looks like the army I will be playing next, as we start messing some with 40k.  Tomorrow is Drink Night again, so I have that to look forward to after a long day of work.  Hopefully everyone will be able to make it and we can find a movie to watch too with little difficulty.

      We have decided to start trying to play some Mordheim games, which are skirmish battles set in the Warhammer world using most of the same rules.  I created a Witch Hunter warband and a Chaos one that I might use sometimes .  The amount of Warhammer games being played should increase here soon because of Storm of Chaos and our own Border Princes campaign that we are running.  Maybe I can get in a victory to two.  I'm getting sick of losing, even if it hasn't been as bad lately.  Two or three times I almost came out on top but I either made a mistake that ruined it or I just didn't have the luck rolling the dice.  I finished one of my books I had picked up from Books-a-million.  Mark of Heresy a Warhammer novel was really good.  I'm starting on Witch Hunter now and so far it is shown to be just as good.  Well I'm off now to get ready for the 4th of July party goings.

      This next 3 weeks is going to suck, especially at work.  I'm talking 40+ hours a week, and serving 450 cheerleaders one week and 350 the next.  I really don't like my job at all anymore and I am starting to search for another one.  I need money bad or I'm gonna be in trouble here in the fall.  Upchurch's 21st birthday party is on the 16th so that should be fun.  There will also be Thursday night drinking club to make the week fun but other than that I don't see much happening in the near future.  I'm lonely and I'm getting afraid that I'm never going to find Miss Right.  Everytime I think I have I've ended up crushed and totally defeated.  Love sucks.  At this moment in time, I really hate my life.  The little things though are the only thing keeping me sane and not going on a killing spree.  SO thanks friends, Warhammer, Anime, good movies, drink night, and rpgs.  Your the only things keeping everyone else alive.  lol.  But as matty used to always tell me, when it rains it pours, and right now it's a bad storm, but sooner or later it's gonna get good again, and I have to just wait the storm out.  Sigh.

      Well I finally have a place to live now for the fall, and well the next year.  John and I found a house to rent over on Chapman Street right off of Highland Ave.  It is a two bedroom, one bath, fairly large kitchen/dining area and a nice sized living room.  The best part is that rent is only $365 a month and split two ways is only like $183 apiece.  You can't beat that anywhere.  I should be able to start moving in Wed, but I probally won't really get to do much until next Friday when I can take off of work.  I will keep you posted on faurther developments as they occur.

      Lots to catch up on since my last real post.  I went this weekend with Cathy to Rome, GA to see our friend Brannon.  It was a good trip, we hung out at Barnes & Noble where Brannon works now and I bought the new Star Wars paperback novel.  We went to a Rome Braves game on Saturday which was cool.  They are the Atlanta Braves's AA team.  We drove back on Sunday and that was really about it.  Nothing too exciting to tell of but it was a good, fun visit none the less.  Today I went into work for a couple hours and cleaned the catering room and fixed the new computer for Kedric.  I'm begining to see more and more that the new boss is a complete idiot.  She has no idea what she is doing and it's gonna make for some reall hell sometime down the line.  I really don't see myself working there for much longer.  Or at least I HOPE I won't be...sigh.  Anyway, tonight Upchurch and I grilled steak which was awesome and now I'm hoping to play some City of Heros before bed.  Look for me on Victory server as either Finwe or Sakura Chan if you want to play together.  Oh, I all most forgot, I also painted Archaon on Foot so I should have that on ebay by tomorrow.  He should get me at least $40 since he is painted.  Well I guess that is about it.  Tomorrow I am going to help Cathy move out of her apartment and also hopefully get my living arrangements for the year finished up and finalized.

      Well the trip to Chicago was great!  We even ended up staying an extra day so we could have time to go around the city and see the sights.  The Gamesday Event was cool, probally more so for me cause it was my first time.  We stayed with Gabe's Uncle and he took Gabe, Michael and I to a "gentlemens" club where Gabe and Michael who were feeling bad for me since I hadn't had a date in almost a year, bought me a lapdance from a very nice looking stripper named Victoria.  That's friendship right there. ;)  We then went bar hopping and had a good time that evening.  The next day we went to down town Chicago and saw the Field Museaum, Solider Field, Navy Pier, Lake Michigan, The HMS Bounty, and the Sears Tower.  We drove to Michael's grandparents that evening and stayed the night and drove back the last 8 hours today.  The trip on a scale of 1 to awesome, it rated a AWESOME.
