        Hello there I,     it's friday again!!!   i get to take my daughter to work today (she's 12 & she can take care of herself while i'm working...so, no problema...), also my boss is not in, the other big cheese is on vacation &amp; it's casual day too!  we get to hang out in the city after work ( which is an early day for me...i'm off by 4pm) so what better way to spend this day but with my daughter?!  Moms gotta get a break too once in a while, of course Dads too should be allowed to take their kids (not toddlers of course or babies unless the company offers back-up daycare, which is great)...We just don't get enough time to spend w/ our kids when we work full-time in an ofc., the weekends are just too short!, & before we know it they're off to high school &amp; dating & have no more time to spend w/ their cornball parents...boo hoo....anyway, if i can find a home-based business or some part-time career...that would be ideal!     anway, my daughter is rushing me...not nice), just wanted to jot down some of my to-do today:          1) try to work till about 3:30 or 4pm...keep my girl busy, she's gotta get on this computer & play some games.     2) after work, go to Chi-town - my daughter wants to go get a hair-styling/trim of her long, long hair.     3)  whle in Chi-town - get some dimsum snacks & bubble tea maybe.  buy some goodies for the folks at home...     4) go home, & hang-out w/ my little boy & my hubby.          (& the start of the weekend)  hooray!          ok, that's it, gotta sign off...guess what song is playing right this very second....     my fave - JT's "Fire & Rain"  -      (? could the day be moreperfect than this???)     ...."thought i'd see U one more time again?  JT asks, & i agree...i know i will see U one more time again...at least before my life expires (wow, here's the drama queen again :)          till then,  au revoir mon amour,

        Good Morning I,     not much to say today. just been thinking that i should change my blog title...i mean if i were to write a book i wouldn't call it - "& the journey continues...", it's too cliche, over-used &amp; beaten down the road littered with wanna-ba-writers hung-over w/ their own self-worth & obsessive thoughts...oops, not referring to me of course. so, i was debating what is a perfect title for this journal>>>          1) my secret love affair (sounds great &amp; mysterious but corny at the same time...)     2) "Truth is stranger than fiction" - but this has been used a million times!     3) Who Am I? - is good, but too existentialist for those ordinary day--to-day musings...     4) "raison-d'etre" - cool, but i'm not even French!     5) voices in my head - this has a certain ring to it...i kinda like it, but now for the next step...          So, it's just one of those boring days, we all have lots of those...     not much to rant & rave about, &amp; too tired to really try...i'll just take it easy today.     too early in the morning to be tired already!     well, here's one good thing, this little song playing in my head this morning was:     "Honey Pie" by the Beatles ( & a cover done by Tuck &amp; Patti which is great too!)     ...i love this song, for those cloudy,gloomy days...it's sure to pick u up.     ...anyway, here goes: "honey pie, u are driving me crazy, i'm in love but i'm lazy...     la, la,la, la ...la, honey pie, my position is tragic...i'm in love but it's ...."     ( i don't know all the lyrics...sorry).     but the melody & the rhythym sure is good...     so till then,       happy singing ,      now it's 5:10 pm (NY time)     i just changed my blog title to :  voices in my head....  ( not the most original i know, but   somehow this resonates more for me right now...i'm sure i could change it again later on, during the many more blogs, months &amp; months later...) ohh, i forgot another good one, "talking to myself" or "writing for herself" (but that's not in 1st person, which I AM.) this is so great, i don't feel lonely & alone knowing so many people out there are also blogging their funny tragic life stories...     life is amazingly simple &amp; complex at the same time...     well till the next blog, SEE Y'All.

       good morning I, sometimes i think only my kids "get" me. nobody else in the world can get me all the time. my 12 yr old girl knows exactly when i'm getting grumpy before i even recognize it myself...(talk abt an early warning device!) she's great that way...she goes: "Mom, why are u grumpy?" & i yell back "No, i'm not!, i'm just...Wow, ur right, i am a little pissed off...&amp; then i stop & think..." so she's wonderful to have around. &amp; then my little one, has a way of melting my heart. never fails. whatever mood i'm in, he heightens it into a positive note...every morning, before i leave for work i have to kiss him & greet him a beautiful morning even tho. he's still sleeping...just looking at his face makes my day. but on the weekends, forgedaboudit! he becomes some kind of a little dictator around the house...yelling orders like: "I want cartoons!", " I want ma-mam &amp; i want ma-mam now!", or "Mommy, let's play!! U be this soldier, & i be that"...."or U be Rocky &amp; i be Billy! (from his Rescue Heroes)....& wakes up the whole house to serve him...&amp; now that he's potty trained, he goes to the toilet by himself like a big guy, my swashbuckling cowboy/soldier...I got him allright. i really should count my blessings...at least there's 2 people in the world who can totally take me for who i am...not even my husband can get me.   ...u know those moments when ur only trying to communicate something & all these other stuff come up, &amp; u just wanna give up & shut down...my husband doesn't get that all i'm saying is:    "can u pls. understand me thru all this confusion?" instead of judging me...asking why, & bringing back what was said &amp; done before...saying stuff like, "don't be starting something again..." when i'm not trying to start anything really, just reaching out...can U hear me?      that's why, God blessed me with these two very intuitive & sensitive kids who know me before i even say anything...they GOT what it is i'm trying to say or make happen, &amp; when something is not happening, they also know there is something missing...& it melts my heart every time one of them asks me: "why are u mad Mommy?", &amp; both of us get stopped on our one sided-track ( a train wreck waiting to happen) & we go, "no baby, Mom &amp; Daddy are just talking..." or some lame excuse... "trying to have a conversation..."  & we become quiet, lost in our own train of thoughts.  that kinda summarizes our 5-year marriage...still trying to have a conversation...a real conversation.   ...hmm, what brought this up? i don't know, just missing my kids during some free time at work.  i'm so pathetic!      but hey, i don't want to dampen anybody's day that's turning out to be sunny &amp; gorgeous after all...despite the weather forecast,   so, "keeping on the sunny side"...   till then,

        it's too early in the week to be daydreaming i know, i usually reserve these for night time solitude...      but, like i always say, what else can i do? (it beats sitting here & staring at a blank screen w/ the blinking cursor... ) what do i daydream the most about?....Hmmm, that's easy... ...i always imagine that "ideal love", that "ideal man" that i've never met, or maybe... bumped into once in my life...but just don't have the courage to rearrange my whole life for...to see, if perhaps, he truly is the One...if there ever is a One?... well, not to be cynical, i do believe there is a One, a soulmate, but that there are also "soul-mates" in one's lifetime...your best friends, your EX-es, your kids, your family, your soul-group...&amp; depending on the Karma that you need to relive and reinvent...you either are blessed to be with that soulmate or doomed to walk this earth like a heart without a proper home...     ... i know, i'm really vague when it comes to matters of the heart...that's my weakness, my "achilles' heel", that's where i go giberrish... did u see that movie "Troy" ( i mean, it's hollywoodized of course) but, the most touching scene for me was, the last moments of Achilles when he realized his true love, & ready to defend his loved one to the death, ready to change into a less bitter man...but as fate would have it, the prince Paris shot an arrow to his heel not knowing he was on their side... that became his downfall...the most celebrated warrior of that time... It's a tragedy of course, like most Greek myths...but it makes me think... what if?     what if, by my own undoing, because i am so jaded about relationships...&amp; because i still don't know what that "ideal relationship" is...ok, so there's no ideal relationship, u gotta keep working on it...well,     what if there is one...where it is less work because you are the perfect match, like peas in a pod...like the Yin to your Yang & vice versa... so, here i go believing in my heart that there is a possibility of finding that true love that is complete...without too much trying...it's just there... it just IS, and how do U know for sure?      for no reason but, that u feel it most when you're together...&amp; even when apart...it's just there....       (sigh) but like the jaded Achilles, i might be walking around, one of the many wounded (by war of the hearts)...like a lost soul searching for its harbor...seeing a vague vision of a lighthouse from a distance, far-away from her reality...but visible through a fog...what if? that light is what's real, & this reality that can crush the spirit from life sometimes, is what is not...because it is something that i have fabricated from all the mis-steps, like a mistake built on top of a mistake, to cover-up the fact that i might have made a bigger mistake?! oh God, how does one get out of that one?! (read to the tune from Rolling Stones "Paint It Black")...          trying to make right what's wrong... or trying to right a wrong from a negative place??...it only works in Mathematics right?... 2 negatives equals a positive?...but 2 positives is even better!... i hate dichotomies!      it doesn't have to be so black &amp; white...      well, that's the sort of daydreaming that i find myself getting lost in once in a while...not too often of course...or i will be walking towards the deep end again my friend...&amp; no, i'm not gonna go there...          till then... still dreaming,

      good morning I, it's rainy again in NYC, i was falling asleep in my commute...nice relaxing ferry ride is always better than the packed-like-sardines-subway. it just takes a little more time...time enough to read a book, read ur newspaper, or as for me this morning, just thinking of nothing (for a change) & just dozing off to the sight of the waves. ...someone once told me that he always pictures me close to the water, maybe i look like a mermaid? (or perhaps sing like one, i wish?!) ...well i am from the islands, my earliest memories of weekends with my family were always spent picnicking on sandy beaches...i'm sure if i had enough money, i wud live by the water...a little beach cottage &amp; i wud be really happy :)  well, how was my weekend? it was good.  i did a lot of my things-to-do, shopped for back-to-school clothes & supplies for my daughter, went to a children's party on sunday (lots of family &amp; food), did my laundry, cleaned around the house a little, watched some Olympic games, what else...cooked a little, that's about it... & now it's back to monday, rainy from the remnants of Hurrican Charley &amp; Bonnie from the South...  i think i'll take it slow today...what else can i do? it's really great when i can have lots of time to think, & not stress out. that's why i "opted out" from a corporate to a non-profit job i guess. my real reason was just to spend more time &amp; energy with what's important to me more than my job - my Self, my family... & around that time i got pregnant with my second child &amp; got married again- all when i was just starting out here on this job...also working here makes me feel good - the knowing that i can contribute in my own small way to making a difference in people's lives...those in need.  but my next goal is to make a more direct connection to making a difference - a career where i can really see & experience firsthand how i can help people, i wanna focus more on children...cause when i'm around kids, my own &amp; other little munchkins, i get so much JOY & working with them will not feel like work at all.  So, my goal is to change careers, maybe become an early education teacher, or special ed. (which i hear is very challenging) or maybe become a school counselor...i have lots of experience in dealing with troubled kids - starting w/ my self, then my hubby & all my other Ex-es! so, i'll take it step by step, &amp; hopefully one day, i will be writing here &amp; logging in about my days in school...  for now, here in the school of life... one baby step at a time,

       good morning I, good morning All...after i checked my work emails this is the first thing i opened...i think this could definitely grow on me like a bad habit. (not that my boss will mind, at least it makes it seem like i'm so busy & serious on some project)...anyway, today i felt like treating myself so i got my favorite starbucks coffee grande w/ soy &amp; the marble loaf! Hmm, & as i'm enjoying it, i meditate on what's new today...   well, aside from noting that it is friday - whoopee!, the 13th! no big deal, i don't believe in superstitions...the conversations i had w/ some regular folks on the bus &amp; ferry seemed to revolve around the next President (hopefully!) John Kerry...also where we'll be during the coming dreaded Republican convention here in our city...why of all places did they have to pick NY?! i mean haven't we gone thru enough already?! after 9-11, the deadly SI Ferry crash, the sudden unemployments, the Bloombergization, FOX 5 biased news (thank God i hardly watch that news, i'm an NBC fan)... It's no wonder why I along w/ a lot of other working parents i get a chance to speak w/ are considering packing our bags & taking the U-Haul to search for a new life...a better life from here? who knows. only time will tell. my brother lives down south (of Georgia) &amp; so is my hubby's sister's family so...at least there's equal representation from both families there. If push comes to shove, there's always some place to run to.   but as i was saying, i'm glad that there is a renewed interest in this voting process...but we still talk abt. the bitterness after all that confusion & whatever-happened-to-the-Florida-votes?...maybe people have grown cynical? ...Maybe. but after 4 years of nothing &amp; this stupid purported Iraq war!, maybe people are at the point of vomitting...enough is enough.    i know they're talking abt the politics of "hope" but if that's the only thing left to keep working class folks such as me going, feeling like maybe a change is gonna come...well then i am all for HOPE...   i always remember where hope came from, especially for me as a kid growing up w/ a lot of "family drama", bitter images of 2 loving parents going thru their own crises, staging their tragic-comedies not realizing the little ones ( the formative not so little teeny sons & daughter) had to sit at home &amp; witness this passion play...while at the same time trying to stay sane & make the grade in school...well, u know what i mean....   ...I always turned to that greek mythology about Pandora's box, where all sorts of evils &amp; monsters have been opened & released to the world....yikes, kinda reminds me of where WE are right now in our times...look at all the funny evil stuff shown in the movies...(i just can't be bothered watching horror flicks anymore...why raise my adrenaline for that??) ...anyway, what remained in that box, waiting to come out &amp; redeem what's lost, what's forgotten...the last thing that remained in that box, the only thing that could give back Love & Peace to people is HOPE...   so, whatever they wanna call it, Politics of Hope, "Help is on the Way"... well i'd rather believe in something good...that there is still some inherent goodness in all of us, &amp; that we will go out there to cast our vote for Hope - John & John, isn't that something? it's almost a sign...they have got to win this time. I don't care anymore whatever vile (which when scrambled up - comes out w/ the word evil)...stuff i hear in this coming republican convention...i just hope it's not gonna be violent around here...hey this is my city too, u know, i live &amp; work here....what about us little folks?! pls. don't cause more trouble than what we've been through...we have families to support too u know.   anyway, there was even 1 older guy on the bus, who listened to the Democratic convention &amp; liked what he heard....who used to be a republican, w/ a son in the Navy or something like that...who thinks that this time he will swing more towards becoming a democrat...Well, that is hopeful.   ...maybe a change is brewing, a good brew just like my coffee...hmmm,   till then, happy trails,   :)

        i guess i just have too much time on my hands right now...my job is kinda seasonally busy...& it seems we're getting more &amp; more into the not-so-busy seasons...yeah, i know it's gonna be my problem soon, but i already started to cover my bases on that one...i've started sending out my resume, posting online at all the job sites, Monster, careerbuilder, yahoo hotjobs, ajc.com, co. sites u name it... i do get tired trying to make 1 cover ltr seem better than the next one...& my work experience? my 1-page resume that's supposed to be able to tell a future employer just how great a worker i am, &amp; just how lucky they will be to hire someone like me...(who mtm, loves to float around w/ her head in the air, writing journals saved on my c:drive, now this...the freedom of blogging has found me!...oh boy, wait until u hear all i could write about...my life, people's lives, my fantasies, & the realities, the little cubes we revolve in just gets too cramped for me...i can't even express myself anymore...i meant to say, it's too damned cramped for me! i probably just need this space &amp; VOILA, here it is. Thanks to the founders of this blogging revolution... )      well, where was i? the questions why...  why am i blogging now...aside from having too much time, i also got too much energy in my brains that don't get much practice. i suppose, reading books in my morning & afternoon commute, my daily relating with my family, the household chores, the chats with friends, the boxes of "things to do", what else? the music that's been put on the shelf, the website that is somewhere sitting in my c:drive with tons of cool stuff...waiting to be ...what? waiting to be worked on?....no, more like ...waiting to be recovered, discovered, whatever...since i've recovered from my "dark" days...i've been taking my time...taking long deep breaths instead of hurried and stressed from too much energy that needs to come out...cause came out it did... out in the deep end where nobody dare go...Only the brave can come back from where my mind have been traipsing...travelling i call it... my mini vacations...but that's in the past. anyway, so why again? because, i can...right now, right here. &amp; if for some paranoic reasons (of mine)...i won't be able to anymore (that's in the future)     ... Alas (with heavy drama)...i'll probably turn to reading Shakespeare and sporting black reading glasses, become a teacher's assistant or a librarian or something very obscurely safe like that...I love safety, i love anonymity - that's why i'm here (how ironic!)... But yes, i do love anonymity...even with all my talents that were waiting to explode, & sometimes they did...like little sparks, or shooting stars...i still love to be able to just BE... just be with mySelf, with all my contradictions...i don't anymore try to find reasons for them cause that only exhausted me &amp; everyone trying to understand or the better word is...trying to put me in a box... at least here, i'm in a limitless box, within a box....so, i'm almost like, i'm imagining being under beautiful crystal clear blue waters, my eyes open & seeing everything there is to appreciate &amp; see...but really, i'm in my cube...like a mini-aquarium...I should've named myself after some favorite fish...but i didn't think of that before....hmm, cause maybe i don't know the names of my favorite fishes (they're tropical fishes, i also love goldfishes, someday i will have my own pond with a Japanese garden)...that's my dream...      for now, i better sign off...i still need my paycheck to paycheck, until the next job/career comes along...i know, it won't just come along...of course i'm searching but i just need a little creative mindbreak right now... my thanks to the bloggers.com' founding fathers & mothers again... what else wud i have been doing if not this right now?.... (probably getting bored, checking more job-searching sites, how much more can i search, before i have to start paying some Agent to find me another job that i'll probably get tired of too)      well, maybe if i just sit here &amp; talk to myself...that "dream job" will come to me...yeah right.  maybe it will come in a dream! ...maybe, if "Muhammad can't go to the mountain, maybe the mountain will come to Muhammad"...i've always believed in that...oops, that should be the other way around isnt it?     "...if the mountain doesn't come to Muhammad, Muhammad will go to the mountain!"...right on. happy trails, till then, still searching,

      i feel so lucky to have found this "free" and "free-ing" space...by some stroke of luck my friend sent me a link to a website "HotorNot" so i can check out her new guy & i checked it out &amp; found it really stupid, but funny, serves its purpose i guess...but at least it led me to this blogger site & now i'm happy. i got enough time on my hands at the moment just to think and blog...maybe i should just make this totally private & nobody can read my mind, but i figured what the heck i am ms. anonymous anyway...i'm afraid my husband will find out about my thoughts &amp; discover i'm becoming more of a stranger to him, yet we live together under the same roof deciding it's best for our kid, doing our best to stay together for our boy - he's so wonderful and kids are so fragile that it's difficult for me to make that move again, but, trying to stay in love? or is there still enough love to see us through???...i've been through it once before in this same lifetime...going thru another divorce just seems so daunting, like another mountain to climb...altho. i was a mountaineer back in school, that was a longg time ago...now i'm full of insecurities. I'm afraid that my actions of wanting my freedom again, will create a bad domino effect on my kids...what if, & all the other what ifs  come up, &  i hear them constantly... the noise around my home...when i'm just trying to build the perfect home for me, the perfect space & room to grow with my kids... i've made my mistakes...but who hasn't? so what if he finds out about my new "escape", my blogs, then what the heck, maybe it's about time he meets the "real" me, not the one he wants me to be, his wife...the stranger. I wish Life was much simpler than what i've created...&amp; i wonder, why do we make the choices we made despite the warning voices in our heads? the nagging doubts...when will there ever be no doubts? That's what i'm searching for... till then,
