      I will probably go and workout this evening after work and before picking Dennis up from the train station. I think it'll be just cardio because I've lifted twice this week. I think I'll do upper body again tomorrow. Cardio tomorrow morning and weights and cardio in the evening.  I'm sitting here eating a dang bagle for breakfast because Dennis rushed me out the door and I didn't have time to fix my instant oatmeal (plain with splenda)..you know someone is rushing you when you can't make thirty second oatmeal..  My direct deposit worked for my check..yeahhhh!! It took forever..I am getting to work at 7:30 am..because we have the one day off a week policy and it makes up for the time..that and a thirty minute lunch. I need to go get ready for this mornings' orientation..see ya!

      I went to the gym after work, walked ten minutes on the treadmill to warmup. Then upstairs to lift weights..lower body today. I did Smith Squats, Smith Lunges and Smith Calf Raises three sets of  15. I did inner and outer hip adduction three sets to exhaustion, I did dead lifts set of three, thirty pounds and lying calf raises at 55, 50, and 45 lbs at 15 reps.  Then went downstairs and did the elliptical trainer for 15 minutes.  So I did the neighborhood and the gym and I took my hydroxycut.  What did I eat today??? Oatmeal for breakfast, yogurt..cheese and crackers for snack..snackwell's crackers, subway sandwich for lunch..no sweets..dinner was a baked potato, with chili beans and turkey, lowfat cheese, fresh corn and spinach salad..I was full..I have not eaten red meat in a month and a few days!

      I walked around the neighborhood swiftly this morning. That's a little over three miles. I hope to lift weights later this afternoon. I liked walking through the neighborhood this morning it was nice. Rabbits fear me. I never noticed how many rabbits are in the neighborhood but there are a lot of them.   I weighed myself, didn't want to but I did..176 lbs. I dropped half a pound. I know I shouldn't weigh myself everyday but I did. I'm also about to start my period and have water weight gain. Maybe I'll drop more once I start it.

      176.5 lbs  5'3" tall  body type:muscular  I stepped on the scale yesterday and discovered that I had gained 18.5 lbs since this time last year. True it has been the hardest period of my life and I'm coming back from it. I sought solace in food and I ignored my clothes getting tighter..I just brought new ones.   A dress I ordered from Victoria's Secret came in on Saturday and when I went to try it on it was way way too tight. I ordered my old size. I had not ordered a dress from them in over a year.   So am I sending the dress back? Nope..I am going to workout until I can fit into that dress.   So this is what I did today. I got up, went to the gym, packed my little backpack with two twenty ounce waters, some sugarless gum, and a towel, and my weight gloves.  I warmed up with 10 minutes on the treadmill and went upstairs and lifted weights upper body. I did 3 sets of high reps 30,25, 20 at a light weight..5-10 lbs. Biceps, triceps, shoulders, chest and back.  Then downstairs and did 50 minutes on the elliptical trainer burned 500 calories..(will post exact calories burned tomorrow when I have my exercise log with me.) Then another 10 minute cool down.  I'm here for support and motivation. So feel free to comment.     Target Weight: 132 lbs

      I am trying hard to stick to my diet and exercise plan. The diet plan is just to watch portion size and to workout&nbsp;5&nbsp;days a week for over an hour a day. So far so good. Yesterday in the gym was blissful. I had energy out the ass!

      more excelerated. I am doing cardio longer. I am trying to go over an hour each session, unless I'm lifting weights. I swear my body is changing. My stomach looked smaller to me. It's not showing up on the scale yet..but I'm changing.  Today I did 50 minutes on the ellipitical trainer for 619 calories and 20 minutes on stairmaster and 20 minutes on the treadmill.

       if I am able to make it to the gym tomorrow.&nbsp; I will have worked out five times this week and four times this week I will have done well over an hour of cardio. I still believe diet is the hardest part.     &nbsp;  Today I lifted with my legs..lower body. I did Smith Squats, Smith Lunges and Smith Calf raises three sets at 15 reps 70lbs plus the bar.     &nbsp;  Lying leg curls, inner and outer hip adduction and leg press.    &nbsp;  I did a 10 minute warm up on the treadmill. I did 45 minutes on the elliptical trainer. 15 minutes on the stairclimber and 10 minutes cooldown on the treadmill. I burned about 680 calories..more or less..    &nbsp;  I'm home alone today..tonight..for the last three hours. Dennis is over at Scotts.&nbsp; The kids are in Virginia.

      Went to Virginia. Didn't workout. I'm getting back into the swing of things but it's hard because I've been having dentist appts and other things that interrupt my workout time. I'm trying though.  20 mins of stairclimber and 15 minutes run/walk on the treadmill yesterday. Plan to workout again today.

      I met my workout goals for last week. I exceeded them. I am down to 174 lbs as of Sunday. I worked out hard last week. This week, I skipped Monday. Today I have to hit the gym after work. My plan to walk this morning in the neighborhood failed..I slept in. Exhausted from the weekend. More later.

      I am in the second day of my period and it's just not real cool to do heavy activity. I'll be in the gym tomorrow.

      But I have been working out religiously. I was in the gym six days a week last week. I think my diet is what's killing me. I love food. The exercise will fall into place, it's diet where my focus should be.
