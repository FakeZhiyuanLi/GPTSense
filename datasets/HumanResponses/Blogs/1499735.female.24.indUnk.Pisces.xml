        Chapter One -  - He adored New York City. He idolized it all out of proportion - er, no, make that: he - he romanticized it all out of proportion. - Yes. - To him, no matter what the season was, this was still a town that existed in black and white and pulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin. - Er, tsch, no, missed out something. - Chapter One. He was too romantic about Manhattan, as he was about everything else. He thrived on the hustle bustle of the crowds and the traffic. To him, New York meant beautiful women and street-smart guys who seemed to know all the angles. - No, no, corny, too corny for a man of my taste. Can we ... can we try and make it more profound? - Chapter One. He adored New York City. To him, it was a metaphor for he decay of contemporary culture. The same lack of individual integrity that caused so many people to take the easy way out was rapidly turning the town of his dreams in ... - no, that's a little bit too preachy. I mean, you know, let's face it, I want to sell some books here. - Chapter One. He adored New York City, although to him it was a metaphor for the decay of contemporary culture. How hard it was to exist in a society desensitized by drugs, loud music, television, crime, garbage ... - Too angry. I don't want to be angry. - Chapter One. He was as tough and romantic as the city he loved. Behind his black-rimmed glasses was the coiled sexual power of a jungle cat. - I love this. - New York was his town, and it always would be ...

      once upon a time i went to the new hampshire primary of 2004 with three other people in pursuit of....pretty much nothing at all. i speak for myself, of course, though i suspect some of the people with me came away equally empty-handed. and if they didn't then, they definitely did later. i sort of take that back about myself, though. i've got footage of larouche dissidents at a dean rally, martin sheen speaking at that same rally, manchester locals, george stephanopoulos, and a guy dressed up as a carrot running for the dem ticket. (one day i'll upload somewhere and share.) but that is another story for another day, and if you really want, you can get some kind of an idea of it  here ,  here ,  here , and  here . it all went downhill after that, though, but you'll be reading about that one day, i'm sure. if this any indication, i almost always find myself mistyping "hampshire" as hampshite."   i didn't, however, realize michael moore had been in manchester, too, until i saw images of him giving a speech in  farenheit 9/11 . had i known, i would have extended my stalking beyond  the daily show  correspondents.  i used to say  jackass  was the best film experience i have ever had. i imagine it was comparable to being a groundling in shakespeare's day with the lower masses congregating in a mesh of cheers, laughter, and  applause. i've just seen michael moore's  farenheit 9/11  tonight after two rounds of drinks with the coworker boys who for some reason paid for mine, and i had the same groundling experience except on an obviously far more political level with far more serious implications. when i see it for the second time this sunday, i'll arrive more prepared with pen, paper, and penlight to try to piece together, for me, why this film eclipses  jackass  on obvious levels while at the same time still failing to escape the strangleholds of a kind of unconsciously misguided sense of recalcitrance that  jackass  also possesses.  i work at national geographic in its moving image library. i'm also a filmmaker who has been very well trained in media theory and history and i think that within one should also be the other, inseparably. for the past year i've had the big advantage in my guerilla ways of occupying a space behind the scenes that has provided me with a lot of visibility as to how documentaries and broadcast news are made in the media industry. i arrived as a cataloger examining both broadcast news and documentary outtakes and programs, and for awhile now i've been working as a researcher for clients that range the gamut of the corporate and the independent. and i'm not being hyperbolic in the least when i say that news and documentaries alike are as fictional as hollywood films. if you don't believe me, come to uptown d.c. sometime and i'll show you some outtakes from news programs shot all over the middle east and asia, as well as outtakes from natural history shows, that boast an unobtrusive objectivity in their edited forms while ignoring the blatant fabrication that belie them in the raw footage. i'm not trying to discredit ngs alone; this is true of   all   forms of media. so when an academic has the gaul to say that christian metz's line, "every film is a fiction film," is quoted too often out of context and too literally, i know he or she isn't particularly aware of how the media industry really operates. and this lack of practical knowledge in favor of theoretical knowledge is why i've abandoned the academic world for having any kind of future for me. however, i also say the same about the production world, but in reverse, so at the end of it all, i'm basically just fucked. but that, too, is another story for another time.  so with all that said, though i do love michael moore, he doesn't get to escape the weight of criticism that i as a media industry professional, a guerilla filmmaker, and an academic well versed in all kinds of subversive theories give to all media, conservative, liberal, and otherwise.   i'll let you know on sunday.

      i've been feeling like shit lately, though i shouldn't, and i know i shouldn't. but i keep remembering one of jon stewart's comments during commencement at william and mary this year: "but what i lacked in looks i made up for with a repugnant personality." lately it seems only 40-year-old gay men find my incessant sardonicism amusing. i think i should resolve to be less of a bitch. or at least that's what a friend tells me.   last night one of my coworkers was a bit like superman. this morning he showed up as a mild-mannered, glasses-wearing, and slightly dressed-up educational sales rep awaiting a major publishing client from boston. last night in chi-town, however, he donned his ripped and sleeveless black t-shirt, black eyeliner, and guitar in all his manifest glam rock glory and rocked the stage with three other equally glam, made-up, and frenetically manic companions who stalked about the stage, wandered into the crowd to accost female audience members, glinted light from multiple piercings, headbanged with heads of hair that haven't seen scissors since this kind of music was last seen in the 80s, and left the stage after five songs. it was great, though. all us coworkers turned up to represent. my 40-year-old gay colleague, who was drunk off of three martinis that he didn't realized would total $30 and who wiped the sweat from his forehead on my metro map to combat the lack of air circulation in the venue, kept turning to me and dropping his jaw in a dry scream as people around us more genuinely shouted out metal battle cries. after one song, "american thunder," sent the band into frenetic convulsions while screaming the title over and over, he turned to me and asked - are they saying a man came to fuck me? hey, i wasn't surprised either. but you should hear the things that come out of my mouth.

        listen  . it should take awhile, and, yes, that is a blatant allusion if you can guess it, especially here. i've been filming these kids for a little while now and this is amazing. i'm making what is the best film i have ever shot about them. i get obsessed and fall madly in love with the subjects i film, so maybe it's the influence talking. but i don't think so. i can say that i am fairly deep in love, though, and this song makes me feel like i'm in new york at night. friday evening big hassle party under early spring skies out on the balcony overlooking a void downtown manhattan that i shot after i found my way to tribeca from the east village for the first time all on my own. walking with  jin  along the derelict shoreline in williamsburg and grabbing late night shots of the manhattan skyline in the cold after shooting from the roof of someone's loft apartment complex in strong gusts of wind. shit like that.   to add, some dop film:  "you in the morning, me in the afternoon"    "back to sleep"    "all new friends"

      tonight my roommate and i talked a little about the roommate hunt. she wants a boy. girls are catty. i agree, so start painting the room blue, for $500 a month, furnished or unfurnished.  somehow that led to a discussion about africans vs. europeans, or, more accurately, non-american white people vs. non-american black people. i told her about being  the only white american surrounded by french-speaking congolese men  all last weekend and how disorienting it was by the end of it. and about how exposure to that now is good for when i actually go to africa in january. but she said i was wrong about that. she studied in switzerland for a year through an exchange program. at the end of it, when she met up with her swiss counterpart who studied in zimbabwe while dionne roughed it out near the alps, the swiss girl remarked how difficult it must have been for dionne because the zimbabweans were generally extremely accommodating and highly sensitive to the feelings of exclusion and isolation that she felt as a stranger. europeans are generally not that warm, the swiss girl said. all the congolese i have met so far fit the opposite mold, and chara has told me the same thing as dionne about the senegalese. you'll fall in love and never want to leave dakar, she said. that actually might be a bit of a sticking point for me. i need to learn to let people be nice to me instead of mounting suspicions. that stops as soon as i come back to the states, though.

      i found out:  muntu kakubi tshiondo . that's the name of roger's   father . in addition to being the prime minister of zaïre from about 1972 to maybe 1978/1980, roger told me his dad was a senator and served as the secretary of energy as well. you won't find his name online, though. i checked. roger said he'd show me pictures later.  i don't know what flaviem is, but roger wrote it in my notebook when he wrote down his father's name for me. maybe it's latin, since roger is quadrilingual and beyond and is teaching it next year, i think.

      a few months ago i moved in with a zimbabwean and a guy raised in philly but born in hong kong. in an ironic turn of events not explained here, the guy who lived in the room i now occupy was turkish. living with an african ended up apropos, too, since soon after i got here i began making films with africans. if you knew, you'd see how it's all been flowing into each other a little too easily. but my hong kong roommate is moving out. he's only two weeks older here than i am, so it's been short. for some reason i think the new roommate will be another girl because, apparently, roommate-hunting is like having a baby.   on an unrelated note, i think i have hypoglycemia, in addition to what i think is endometriosis. it would explain the abnormal overheating when hungry or even mildly active, haziness and weakness when hungry, extreme sugar sensitivity, and monthly child-bearing-strength cramps that require enormous doses of advil that can exceed 20 pills by the end of the day and that are capable of rendering me immobile on the floor. i think when i indulged in anorexia as a teenager, i fucked some things up. haven't gotten any of it checked out yet because doctors, biopsies, bloodwork, laser surgery, and drugs cost money, even with health insurance coverage. go america. i should check out before i fly away to sénégal, so i'll get right on that. when i can afford it.

      this weekend has been a long one of prepping for a shoot set in a nganda, or local neighborhood bar in congo.   last night i mostly sat and watched gary and franco transform an under-construction basement with a dj set-up into, according to them, a really convincing replication of a modern, small-scale congolese hangout. it was amazing, and came out of nowhere surrounded by debris, abandoned toys, and $3,000 works of african art. the latter included a life-sized relief sculpture done in what i will say is stained bronze. this isn't congolese, gary told me about the tribal african man depicted. he's sudanese. you can tell by the eyes. he touched the raised eyes on the panel and my old and long-abandoned bourgeois, museum-going instincts almost made me tell him that he shouldn't put his hands on it. the night before we tried to do all this but we showed up behind schedule at the guy's house and had to cross back over the woodrow wilson bridge in pouring rain when no one answered our calls.  today we spent a long eight hours shooting the five-minute scene. bottled coke and pepsi; bottled zaïrian beer; an endless number of zaïrian lps featuring late 70s and early 80s, mc hammer-coiffed singers and bands bearing names like "croc tonic;" multi-patterned drapes; crates as tables surrounded by lawn chairs; a guy dressed as a fully uniformed, gun-toting paramilitary soldier sitting always in the background; and disco lights set the scene. we brought a lot of high-luminosity lights and shorted out the power strip every half hour until we thought to switch outlets. a wayward bug make-believed as icarus and flew too close to a light when at one point tasha pointed out in alarm that one of the lights was smoking. after we unplugged it and could look at the lamp without being similarly blinded, we could see the little insect corpse lying defeated on the floor. other than that, there were no other casualties. the disco lights would only pulsate and move when the congolese music boomed, though, so i brought along my colored gels and taped them to flashlights that an off-camera person waved around at actors' faces when they had to speak in front of the camera.  for the past two days, I've been the only white person among 10-15 thirtysomething french-speaking african males, and a little less often I've been the only female. so now that the first scene of roger's film is over, i think i'm feeling a little bit of culture shock. which is kind of nice because i'm going to need that for two weeks in dakar, sénégal. watching dark-skinned people through the camera lcd screen all day, after awhile jean-luc godard's comment came to mind about how innovators of film stock never developed film emulsion properties to accommodate the skin colors of darker people. i wondered if a privledging of the white skin has ended up true in the newer digital and electronic technology as well.  it feels oddly like winter right now. maybe it's because it's been unusually cool this weekend and taking out warm laundry is actually nice, and because I've spent my days looking at the inside of a mock-up nightclub and exiting that diegesis only during the dark or near it.  i only just now realized that i spent the whole of my last winter during those kinds of nights with the walkmen, and this next one will be with africa. and speaking of which, chara was supposed to call me this weekend. generally i like the enclosed feeling of winters, but the taste of it i have here right now is fairly stifling. i'm easily restless and culture shock for me isn't limited to the unfamiliar. vertigo seems to find its way into familiar surroundings too, so it'd be nice to get to new york soon where that would happen all the time.  can i see some film clips? el asked me after she told me she had to go. i don't know why she asked but that feels about right.

      this isn't about film so much, but it is about the city. i spent the entire day setting up for a shoot for roger's film that will roll cameras tomorrow and aftwards i sped home to get to safeway. i was starving. i'm an infamously picky eater and grocery shopping is usually one of the more stressful points of my week because i'm poor and hate food, but tonight i managed to speed through the aisles and get a lot of shit into my basket. and i was surprised, too, when for all that quantity, it was a pretty cheap tab. my low point of the night, though, was when i was bagging groceries. two older guys were behind me in typical alcoholic fashion: unshaven faces, gaunt, bent demeanor, hollow eyes, and overall shiftiness. or at least this was my first impression.   a side note before i continue: i have a rather (un?)healthy hatred towards men because they are all assholes. so i tend to be quick to assume the worst. it's a self-protection thing, and it's an important thing to do when you're in a city and lack a penis, in my opinion. and it works for me a lot. people rarely fuck with me. they know better.  so here i am with my week's worth of groceries, which is, for once, fairly substantial, and behind me are these two guys buying only three tall cans of beer. i'm generally pissy when i'm by myself, especially when it's late at night and i'm about to walk into a deserted parking lot all by myself, so i didn't spare these guys my pre-emptive bitch vibe. so when one of them walks over to me, stands close, and mumbles something incoherently to me, i give him my best write-off, followed by an obviously annoyed "uh huh" as he keeps persisting. finally, i give him a really angry, no, i've got it, thinking that he was trying to offer to help bag my groceries. which i don't need any man's help with. he finally got enough of a hint to speak more clearly and tells me, no, i just need a bag for my beer. oh. sorry. sorry, i've had a bad day, i tell him sheepishly as he bags, even though i hadn't. it's ok, he mumbles sadly, i guess this kind of thing happens to you a lot. he hurries away. i felt badly. i hurried up and left, too.  actually, that kind of thing doesn't happen to me often. because i'm a bit of a bitch and a believer in the unfortunate fact that women are more sexualized than personalized. obviously men are sexualized, too, but with women, they have for far longer been objects of spectacle so it's something that's hard to get away from when you're a woman walking down the street. it's incredibly disempowering. i'm already pretty angry, so this kind of shit pisses me off more and i fight it by coming off as pretty aggressive. but that can be difficult when the new york city state-of-mind isn't matched up by your surroundings. it wasn't this guy's fault he has a penis while waiting in line at the grocery store.  in a perverse kind of way, it's good this kind of thing happens to me occasionally. i need to learn that it's not always ok to be an asshole just because most other people are. this bitchiness on par with kat's of  ten things i hate about you  fame probably explains my single status. not many people can deal with a surly, cynical, and sarcastic asshole in one dose. once you get past the scary person, though, i am really nice. i do have a lot of friends, including those of the male variety, and even they, the latter especially, have quickly learned to accept the words "suck my cock" that frequently come out of, though not into, my mouth.

      dance music is blasting from my roommate's room. she also left the tv on in the living room and it's loudly projecting people's inane words about reagan at the national cathedral. so it sounds like a funereal remix in my apartment at the moment.  ghil and i walked out of the 17th street nat geo building a few days ago and i thought of something: reworking shakespeare with the likes of jon stewart, chris rock, george carlin, dave chappelle, wanda sykes, conan o'brien, et al. so far i've envisioned either  chappelle  or rock as othello, and maybe conan as romeo, but that's about as far as i've gotten. it's been awhile.  ah, look, it stopped: my roommate is leaving and she just turned off the tv.

        Early in the novel that Tereza clutched under her arm when she went to visit Tomas, Anna meets Vronsky in curious circumstances: they are at the railway station when someone is run over by a train. At the end of the novel, Anna throws herself under a train. This symmetrical composition – the same motif appears at the beginning and at the end – may seem quite “novelistic” to you, and I am willing to agree, but only on condition that you refrain from reading such notions as “fictive”, “fabricated”, and “untrue to life” into the word “novelistic”. Because human lives are composed in precisely such a fashion. They are composed like music. Guided by his sense of beauty, and individual transforms a fortuitous occurrence (Beethoven’s music, death under a train) into a motif, which then assumes a permanent place in the composition of the individual’s life. Anna could have chosen another way to take her life. But the motif of death and the railway station, unforgettably bound to the birth of love, enticed her in her hour of despair with its dark beauty. Without realizing it, the individual composes his life according to the laws of beauty even in times of greatest distress. It is wrong, then, to chide the novel for being fascinated by mysterious coincidences (like the meeting of Anna, Vronsky, the railway station and death, or the meeting of Beethoven, Tomas, Tereza, and the cognac), but it is right to chide man for being blind to such coincidences in his daily life. For he thereby deprives his life of a dimension of beauty.   (Milan Kundera in  The Unbearable Lightness of Being ) the fortuitous circularity of everything here over the last several months is so intricate that nothing is in order, because it doesn't mean anything and because it's impossible to write about it otherwise. i've never been intent on believing in any meaning because of the chance of coincidence and the coincidence of chance, but, on a cue from kundera, have just been discontent to sit back and regard it all with incredulity. and that's also how i've gotten into africa.  i'm sort of caught in a dissolve.  fernando and i have been friends for a long time and contact has always fluctuated, but look, we seem to come back at just the right time. he introduced me to  roger muntu  because i told him my friend chara invited me to the city of dakar in sénégal and i wanted to make a film there. i say dissolve because roger is involved with producing  music and film , as well as being heavily invested in all things africa.  we've been working together on a film of his for awhile. in france, the ministry of culture will actually give people grants to create things. it's been especially interested as of late in minority artists and will give filmmakers anywhere from $40-80,000 to fund a film provided that 80% is shot in one's country of origin. roger has been soliciting that ministry and is making a short film about a congolese immigrant newly arrived to new york city in order to submit it to them in hopes of obtaining a grant. he's starring, so i'm the director of photography and probably assistant director, maybe even producer. defaults are nice. i'm also revising the script, since his first language is french. he also speaks lingala and swahili, two other congolese languages. if we get funding, he told me, we'll go shoot a film in congo. i'm down with that.  driving back from shooting at reagan national airport last weekend, where a cop brushed us off even though we were quite obviously holding a large camera aimed at an airport, and instead accosted several hispanic teenagers doing absolutely nothing save watching the planes lift off over the potomac river, he told me more about how his father was murdered by president mobutu. roger's dad had been a prime minister in zaïre, now the democratic republic of congo, before resigning after the distaste of president mobutu's actions in the country. roger's father was involved with his country's affairs long after his resignation and one day both he and roger's stepmother were found dead. this was after roger had fled to new york city to seek political asylum after being imprisoned without a trial and tortured for participating in a university-based political group. but i'm sure you've already read about that. the couple had approached a family doctor after falling ill and died a few days later. the doctor contacted roger in the states and told him he had been able to perform a secret autopsy on the two bodies and found that the cause of their deaths derived from laced food. roger's father's first name is the same as roger's last (muntu) and i couldn't quite catch the surname when he told me about it in the car. i couldn't find anything in google to learn more, though, so i guess the mobutu-induced media hush in zaïre at the time did well to render muntu forgotten.   two weekends ago i shot for a show focusing on congolese americans that airs weekly in the congo. as the guy spoke his introductions for the show's segments, roger's satirical short film played silently in the background on one of the monitors and featured an overly caricatured mobutu wearing his classic tiger-print hat. see, the backlash is already starting to play out for him. but if we shoot in congo, even now, he tells me, we'd have to tread carefully to make a film about congolese conditions and political strife. even though it's better now after mobutu, he told me, the new president is wary of criticism and so the government could shut down production, or at the very least make it difficult, if they sensed that was going on.  driving back from the airport, he told me a little about his eight years in new york city. when he first arrived, he was put up in a room shared by 15 others in similar positions. there were a few beds and most of the men slept on the floor. he didn't know any english and he was given $4,000 in aid that was stolen soon after. by cleaning people, he guesses. once he became a bike messenger. he really loved it, was really good at it. the walkie-talkies, traffic dodging, leanness from constant excercise, all that. there were only two africans, only two black people actually, in this messenger company he worked for. the other became a good friend of his. and then one day they were riding together and he was behind his friend. and his friend didn't see the car coming because he only looked one way before crossing the intersection. he said that he wasn't hit terribly hard, but that the impact catapulted him in the air and flipped him over so that he landed head-down. i thought about the guy describing people jumping from the towers and how as he was one of the lucky ones getting out a firefighter or police officer kept saying, don't look to the right. don't look to the right. he looked and people had fallen, and were falling. he watched a pregnant woman hit the ground and explode like a watermelon, the fetus still attached to her through the umbilical cord. roger said he couldn't look at the body on the street. the police arrived and he was crying. the guy had just gotten married a few weeks ago. he and his friend's widow kept in touch for a few years, he said, but she moved to florida or somewhere and that stopped after awhile.   fernando always tells roger that his life is a movie and because it's not, i think it should be.

      so i'll just start.  at one point along connecticut ave there are series of short, squat poles (not the people, though) guarding the entrance of some building against potential out-of-control cars, or at least that's what i assume, and they are capped with heads in what i always like to point out is a phallic salute of sorts. national geographic recently installed new decorative iron-cast statues around its grounds. a large ram in front of the 17th street building faces away from the building and looks out onto the street, greeting visitors and workers leaving the building with what my friend has dubbed "ram nads."  i research motion pictures for national geographic in washington, d.c. today at work i had to look for phallic imagery. the project actually included vaginal imagery as well, but i gave that part to my coworker since i seem to specialize in penises. an education covering feminist film theory finally pays off in the form of the washington monument, the chrysler building, the empire state building, air traffic control towers, mosque minarets, the luxor obelisk in paris, cuban and italian obelisks, oil drilling towers, light houses, centre point tower in sydney, launching rockets, bottle rockets (in which the denouement of one shot involves water squirting at the camera), zucchini, cannons, geysers, muskets, time lapse sprouting mushrooms, and richard nixon. as per the company's request, tricky dick.   i told you I was good at this. as for coworker david's end, there's an extreme close-up of a slowly blinking croc eye, butterfly tongues inside flowers, cave openings, and the requisite beaver. the animal, that is.   oh, and by the way -  this site was going to be different than what it is now, and one day i'll re-post what i had written here before, but in later revised editions to protect the innocent and not-so-innocent. obscure tell-alls later as we go, and you can do some preliminary guesswork from the disclaimer above.

      such a bad thing to do on thursday night when you know you've got a huge project to walk into the next day. which has been the case every day for weeks. but what else are you going to do. especially on a society-wide invitation.  tonight the a-guy* told me, you're way ahead of the au kids [the american university film production mfa students] .  * he made a film in cairo,  driving an arab street , among other things, that was aired on pbs, and has moved on from research to editing/producing segments for aptn. also an mfa holder from au. he knows his shit, though i admit it's a love-hate relationship. except when we're drunk. then we end up drifting into talking a lot. it's how i told him i'd send him links to the film excerpts, except when on the sober monday i didn't intend to carry through, he asked otherwise. he bought me a beer tonight, too, and that's not the first. before she left, leah said it looked cozy.  so wow, thanks. that was fucking unexpected. and ringing in my head since, though i suspect i know more than he thinks.  and between you and me - really, he hasn't seen anything yet, no al jolsen intended. literally, because, actually, he's only seen one dop clip.

      coworker leah came over tonight to look at the roll of super 8mm film she had test-shot for a found camera. i ended up showing her my film equipment, how to edit, and how i once edited, and screening not just her three-minute strip of film but my own hour-long super 8mm film about times square y2k,  trompe l'oeil , as well. i'm still really surprised she loved it so much because, technically speaking, it's kind of crappy. the film is full of scratches and needs to be cleaned of specks of emulsion and dust. the soundtrack is distorted and badly in need of re-recording. in short, it needs major restoration and one day i'll devote myself to rebuilding it. she liked the rawness of it though, and i guess she's right. super 8mm is a crude medium for which you forfeit a lot of control. she said i should screen it for the fundraiser for the film she's about to shoot in new york - she liked the irony of that - and i said if i did, it'd have to be without the sound. she disagreed, and i can tell i've been warped into aural hyperconsciousness by making music films.  i cleaned  trompe  just now for the first time in a long time because the cleaner tends to wear away the magnetic sound striping that lines either side of the film, one along the sprocket holes, the other directly opposite. it felt a lot like sitting at a potter's wheel and there i realized most of the scratches are on the base of the celluloid, not the emulsion. i learned the difference way back when i used to project and assistant manage a theatre. black for base, and that means green is for the scratches on emulsion. green because the scratch is the unexposed color latent in the emulsion now revealed. now you know, next time you're in a movie theatre. after the films and artwork of my studio, leah made me feel really accomplished, historically, tonight, and i think i've forgotten how much i've been working since i was 17 and things turned over. she says i'll be one of those people they'll write about one day and my current films will end up popular in the underground. that i'll be a todd haynes yet, karen carpenter superstar and all. so aim low, in my case.  i think i'm going to restore it really soon. reinstate the soundtrack, all digitally. i need more film cleaning fabric and research, though. film is kind of buddha. it's forever decaying from the moment it's produced, well beyond exposure and development, if first you can beat the expiration date. but i really bought the  trompe l'oeil  film for australia and new zealand and it got exposed months after its intended use and it's still fairly well, even tonight. but it's biodegradable and eventually gets eaten away - so 80% of silent cinema is believed to be lost. i have a memory of a moving image of an archivist uncovering the lid of a can to show us beneath it where crumbled celluloid got a glimpse of air and light again for the first time in decades, but never again for the front of the brighter projector bulb. leah marvelled at my small collection of buster keaton super 8mm films stacked on a shelf. they sit the wrong way, though. they should be vertical in their reels, not horizontal, because gravity will eventually buckle the strips of film. i fixed that, by the way, using reels of leader and of odds and ends as bookends.   i have a friend whose parents still talk about the night i came over with my 35-pound projector and screened  sherlock, jr  on a white sheet stretched across the living room doorway. the film came with a failing piece of paper that reads:  Excellent print of a rare 1924 Buster Keaton comedy classic. Buster plays a projectionist in a cinema who lets his imagination run away with him right into the film he is showing! Once there he dizzily dances to the editor's change of scene in one of the funniest and most imaginative sequences ever filmed -  - i made a film from that sequence.  malec in durée , walkmen music -   - From then on it's just one long laugh as he tries to solve a crime, prove his own innocence and win the girl of his dreams! All without any hint of a smile on his own face! Sherlock Jr. has a big plus for classic movie buffs - it shows you just what an old time movie theatre was really like with scenes of the auditorium, foyer and of course, the projection box itself! that's the saddest thing i've ever heard, to quote marty, who tends to help start my mornings these days.  i used to be a staunch radical for only film. but i can't stand how precious it is anymore. everytime there's a scratch, or the colors seem to fade, it breaks me down with the film a little more. the allure of the immaterial image that i railed against so long has won me over. i couldn't take the frailness anymore.  this feels like writing about someone i used to be close to whom i haven't spoken of in a long time. we once spent a spring break together and twice that week i stayed awake for two days, subsisting on tea and unable to eat, drink, or sleep for want of splicing. tonight i wasn't hungry when i should have been, and i feel badly it's turned out this way.

      my bedroom has become a studio for editing and whenever i'm in it not sleeping i mostly face the corner at my corner-built desk. it's a large amount of space that sits behind me from that corner, and recently i've found that it's a lot warmer and smaller when under dimmed lights the television glows with whatever overly rerun film i've got on in my limited collection of vhs tapes that stand in for the cable that isn't able to reach to the far end of the apartment. but it's usually the neon blue of standby that glows, though, as the film sits on pause, if it's even on at all, for my films over in the corner. but it's still very, very warmly small. sometimes i'll get drawn out of the corner when i'm slacking from what i shouldn't, and every time i leave it and see the space of the room like that, i think that i should really be sitting in that warmth with someone else, besides the hamster in the other corner.    beautiful girls  is the rerun i've started and am in front of tonight, which is fitting because timothy hutton looks familiar as that person i knew. but he's not because it's a lot warmer and legimate in the end. he says to marty near that ending - hey, marty. i hope we stay in touch. because i hope to learn someday about what you're doing. because i think, whatever it is, it'll be amazing. i really do.  i hope it turns out as nice as that. i've been thinking of that a lot, and i'm glad it's over.

      highlight of the night: jin calling me from band practice over in greenpoint, brooklyn as the dirty on purpose kids played "your summer dress," which, over the phone, sounded like some bizarre, distorted, and experimental 80s techno mix. but it did the trick.

      went to lunch with an emmy award-winning producer today. he's got three of them and they sit in disarray on the top of a filing cabinet slightly askew from the wall and next to a ramshackle, moveable shelf type of thing. he just moved in. because i'm not phased by things like that and because our meeting had nothing to do with producing high-profile broadcast news, it was simply a meeting, or "power lunch" as dave dubbed it, with the cool, higher-up boss guy who knows everyone. say hi to spielberg, he quipped as i walked out to catch up with the producer. smartass. in the crowded elevator, hugs were exchanged and conversations had. apparently someone just had a baby and it was in the building and he should go "up" and visit. i work on the second floor; beyond lies the more mythologically-bound employees of some elevated kind of status, where these people were from, so i felt a little out of place walking alongside that conversation as we stepped out of the elevator. he said hi to several more people during the brief walk from the elevator lobby to the front entrance doors. it didn't stop on the streets, either. the short walk to the daily grill was also occasionally broken in stride by head nods and hellos to passers-by, during which it somehow emerged that i was a filmmaker. he seemed surprised and intrigued. doesn't he know that nearly everyone in the lower echelons is always a filmmaker? turns out he was the best man at the wedding of the guy who is president of both knitting factories, la and nyc. it never ends.  at the restaurant only the waiter interrupted us and i abated that newly-made acquaintance awkwardness by, as i usually do, posing a lot of questions about the deal for which i am to initiate research. always a good line to go down, i find. makes you look informed and with it. so i also found out he used to be a producer for  nightline  on abc and did a fellowship for a year in germany with broadcast television. the only truly bad thing about the lunch was that it happened right after dave and i passed away a few minutes of the afternoon by launching rubber bands at each other. the residue from the rubber stuck resolutely to my fingers and every once and a while flavored the chicken sandwich i had ordered. that shit never washes off. our boss told us not to fight while she was gone to my city, new york, so i guess in that respect she was right. but i still came out of it and back out onto the streets discovering that my education clients apparently love me and i am needed, initially, to research footage and facts, encode, possibly edit, and ftp images for this client. and i'll get to write, too. i'm back-up, maybe dividing it up with the full-time person who will come on later and work the unfortunate night shift (i may too), and all over education again after that. so i call dibs on extracting and writing about countries of the week.

      well, never mind that. next time, and a move sometime soon.   so new york's out, though only for tomorrow, but africa just made my night. maybe not senegal, but it's highly likely i'm going somewhere in the continental vicinity to make a film sometime in january, so films dop and walkmen have to be done by then.

      ham again, as i listen and watch him now.  going home on wednesday. and by that i mean new york city. and by train again, but on business with coworkers this time and without bypassing it for boston and then for manchester by car. it'll be a blow to the past and i'm still not sure how to look at it, but i'm sure it will be full of -   there's this scene in  days of heaven  where the farmer says to abby - i think i love you.   and  she  replies - what a nice thing to say.

      i've been working fairly consistently in the past weeks and it's made me into someone a little different, i think i can feel. there's this filter i put over all the images to make them look filmic - and they do - and it calms them down, too. and that's sort of how i've been feeling. video is always a lot more hyper.  i find myself quoting it all the time. phrases that everyone else says, too, but when ham says them - they there are. most noteably: it was  hor rible. this past friday night, the night when the coworkers go out for drinks, we went out as usual but wandered deeper into town for once, ending up in adams morgan. not as sexy as saying the east village or lower east side, but it's as good as it gets in d.c. i ended up losing everyone with josh up on the roof of some bar and i asked him - where the hell are all the other guys - in that same almost initially stalling, metered way ham says it. i pick up their intonations in other moments of my speech, too. and did i tell you i used to adopt their mannerisms i picked up on film? yeah, that's started again. there's this moment in the beginning, when "what's in it for me" first starts and everything is a little unsettled onstage. there's only the organ and just before that stops, pete turns restlessly. i do that all the time.   it always happens this way. i get consumed and the only way out is to finish. the links no longer work, i know. i had to take them down, probably a little needlessly and pre-emptively. people are assholes, though. so to quote ham again, nooo fucking around, dude. or they go away. i've reinstated them, but here they are in sum:   dirty on purpose:    "you in the morning, me in the afternoon"    "all new friends"    "back to sleep"     the walkmen:    beginning,  before new york     ham and paul (fk josh shocked at brownies), souncheck    "don't be long," soundcheck and concert one    paul, "revenge wears no wristwatch," concert one     ham, "wake up," concert one    fk nick and ham, backstage    backstage before concert three

      at a corner waiting for the light to change, a man stood for the passing traffic this morning. i walked to the corner and broke stride only a little as i was about to cross to the median. as i stepped at the edge of the curb, the man positioned himself next to me while another man stepped up on the other side of median and we crossed over together. we waited there in line along the median and i stared at an angle at the oncoming traffic while facing ahead. i anticipated the clear to walk before the light changed only seconds before it did and they followed and briefly we kept in pace until they pulled ahead of me later across the street. they pulled away together, the gap of space of where i should have been between them, and i thought i saw them glance smilingly at each other before they split up between the trees that line the middle of the sidewalk.    we have a lot of educational projects going on at work, which means watching a lot of programs and trying to pull from them segments that would complement topics in a text book. today arthur reviewed some program that touched upon controlling the feral cat population in the outback of australia. apparently they overhunt the native marsupial species. so an extermination team - a man and a woman - set a trap: hidden in a bush, a flute-like cylinder with the words "feral animal research company," or farc as arthur dubbed it, lining the length of it that emitted a repetitive, incessant, mewling whine. a good way to meet some neighbrhoods, as arthur said. next to it they set up an old-fashioned, pressure-sensitive spring trap and smeared it with a concoction of cat feces and urine stored in a plastic one-gallon milk container. if there's a cat in the area, it will want to investigate the cat cry and smell, the exterminator explains. the two exterminators leave the area and return a few hours later. the guy takes a shot gun from the bed of his truck, explaining as he goes that he can't get sentimental about killing cats. they're not like housecats, he explains. they're feral. the two walk up to where the trap had been set and seeming to lounge almost comfortably is a cat, its leg stuck in the trap. cut to a wide and a neat pop sounds as the shotgun discharges and lodges a bullet into the cat. they pick it up by the feet as if they had just killed a rabbit for dinner. as arthur put it -   she didn't do anything. she just wanted to sniff some poop. and look where it got her.

      it's funny what carries the most with the most weight. little things. the concerts themselves are fairly sterile for retrospect. i don't even really remember being there anymore and when i can it's only in the images i didn't make. april filmed after soundcheck when the lights went out for the arriving first-show crowd and in that shot when no one was doing anything, she went along the soundboard. and i had forgotten about the lights that lined the stairs up there in the soundbooth, where anyone could go up. it was right next to the backstage door, too, where we watched some of the boys enter and leave. and while she's on the soundboard, built to spill starts up, and keeps breaking off with stopping shots only to begin again. i can remember liking the song over the venue's loudspeakers while i was standing up there not filming. i went back to the film only once after the end of november, before things cleaned up, to hunt that out. so now that's when i can remember most what it was like to have been there, in a series of messy, unimportant little shots. everything happened mostly at night when things were just a little blind, as they mostly do when i'm in new york. i couldn't make out any of the lyrics to find it but i somehow landed on i can't see your response. so when i found out, i listened to it over and over in the thick of it and every time all i could see was the venue at night. and april's silver gates in chelsea. porters along 8th ave somewhere. halloween in the streets. chinatown. tribeca. canal street. until it no longer meant anything, but that was true only in my car stereo. i can't see this anywhere else anymore, and now i have a headache.   fuck.

      if you drive around and blast "we've been had" from you car, you sound like an ice cream truck at first, but it's worth it. i haven't done that for a long while except for this afternoon.  this week, nothing but  before new york  after work and it might be safe to say now i'm back into it. so here's the  beginning .  treat it kindly. he said he liked the intro in an email long ago.

      tonight i came home and turned on all the lights. all my roommates are gone.  charles bukwoski is new inside my pantheon, as seeing him in a trailer before  control room  reminded me of me despite the lack of jackassery, drunkenness, and debauchery. one day, though. everything else is intact. i've known people like that, or who will become like that, anyway.  my first search, and i really liked it: "question and answer"          he sat naked and drunk in a room of summer         night, running the blade of the knife         under his fingernails, smiling, thinking         of all the letters he had received         telling him that         the way he lived and wrote about         that--         it had kept them going when         all seemed         truly         hopeless.          putting the blade on the table, he         flicked it with a finger         and it whirled         in a flashing circle         under the light.          who the hell is going to save                                          me? he         thought.          as the knife stopped spinning         the answer came:         you're going to have to         save yourself.          still smiling,         a: he lit a         cigarette         b: he poured         another         drink         c: gave the blade         another         spin.

      good thing about working at nat geo, even in the film library, is that i can borrow stuff. i took home scott's sony dvmc da2 that i'm ebaying for, to test it out. so all this afternoon i've been looking at the walkmen film,  before new york , on my monitor and i noticed it's gotten to be very odd to watch. it's become inextricably tied up with the manchester primary now, or, rather, the trip itself and the people involved, which all seems like a very long time ago. it's odd to look back and not really be the person who shot this anymore. it's ended up a visual manifestation of things left behind that i'd like to keep that way. i came out of everything not as strong of a person in some ways as i used to be, but i did come out a much, much stronger filmmaker so i've come to think maybe my life lives vicariously through filmmaking and when i don't do it often enough and in ways varied enough, some things stop. i would have done a lot of things differently, but isn't that the way it goes. i became more personally entrenched in this film and what surrounded it than any other i've made, so i'm unsure of how to edit it. the walkmen lack any kind of affect now, except for off-color connotations tied to certain things passed that have a hard time offering up ways for me to identify with them. i come back around occasionally and hear walt's organ building up undertones and i remember driving to new york after work in the dark the night before halloween, the silver gates in front of april's apartment in chelsea, wandering the daytime city streets for camera straps and an ion charger, the knitting factory, meeting my grip at penn station, walking the nighttime city streets among the remnants of the halloween parade, how warm it was so late in october, filming in the dark for hours -

      i recently calculated it out and 40% of my income, after taxes and after expenses, goes into my new york city/senegal fund. i'm still about to ebay for a sony dvmc da2, though, a unit that converts final cut pro's firewire-friendly only signal into typical av inputs a tv monitor can read. so i can watch my films on tv as i edit. sony doesn't make these converters anymore, so ebay it is. shit. i've also got to buy a dvd burner.  i think i'm also going to buy an expanse of webspace so i can upload entire sequences of the walkmen and dirty on purpose films, which exist only as fragments right now and probably will for awhile. editing is always the longest part.

      sunday is gone. but i've been sick, transitioning to a hypoglycemic diet (official diagnosis coming soon) that entails de-toxing from caffeine, white flour, and sugar. it's hard to grocery shop in america and avoid those things, so withdrawal from long built-up dependencies has made the past few weeks full of headaches and fatigue. wheat and working out are my new allies.   but last sunday i sat in a theatre and again got a headache from hunger, de-caffeination, and staring up at a screen from my seat only three rows back. last time it had been first row, with similar effects. but i took some notes.  at work this week, before i got dragged away to do some research for a new explorer show for nat geo tv, i began gathering footage of iraq for a compilation tape. most of what i've seen is from bagdad: fly-covered corpses in cars riddled by bullet holes from a shoot-out; a surviving woman who couldn't eat food a soldier offered because her face was full of shrapnel; a dead girl in a van, crumpled to one side and entirely covered by her burka save two feet, one unshoed; soldiers trying to resuscitate one of their drowned friends; smouldering buildings; streets resembling chernobyl-like abdandonment; decaying fuselages of long-crashed planes; and more similarly happy things. it's been a segue.  i've been reading  jihad vs. mcworld  by benjamin barber, whom i came across because of my obsession with new york that i satiate in part with wnyc npr. i heard him give an interview on the station and months later, on the morning of a day when i caught the chi-town bus from d.c. to new york for a cd release shoot, i bought his book as travel reading because i was smitten by his amazingly articulated thoughts that so exactly mirrored my own sentiments. i'm still going through it because i only have time to read on the metro, so the prolonging of his words has been coloring the way i've been seeing things for quite awhile.  Americans were themselves first enraged and then deeply puzzled by scenes from Islamic cities where ordinary men, women, and children who could hardly be counted as terrorists nonetheless manifested a kind of perverse jubilation in contemplating the wanton slaughter of American innocents. How could anyone cheer such acts? Yet an environment of despairing rage exists in too many third-world neighborhoods of first-world cities, enabling terrorism by endowing it with  a kind of quasi-legitimacy it does not deserve.  ...  In  Jihad vs. McWorld , I worry that a pervasive culture of fast food, fast computers, and fast music advanced by an infotainment industry rooted in the spread of brands tend to homogenize global markets and render taste not merely shallow but uniform. McWorld's culture represents a kind of soft imperialism in which those who are colonized are said to "choose" their commercial indenture. But real choice demands real diversity and civic freedom. ...  Jihad is then a rabid response to colonialism and imperialism and their economic children, capitalism and modernity. ...  McWorld is everywhere, CivWorld is nowhere. But Nike and McDonald's and Coke and MTV can contribute nothing to the search for democratic alternatives to criminal terrorism; instead, these corporations sometimes inadvertently contribute to the causes of terrorism. That is the melancholy dialectic of Jihad vs. McWorld.  in succinct essence, as barber explained over the radio, we're confusing democracy with free market economy. moore subtlely reaches that point in his film, but that's not really his objective so it's never explicit. the nearest it gets is in the sequence depicting a rally of corporate "have-mores." but people like the bushes and the rest of his "base" aren't really confusing anything, i believe, because they are just that - base - when it comes to matters of greed. i still have yet to fully understand the allure of excess and i think that maybe the ancient greek oracle of delphi has further entrenched that inability, so i'll probably never arrive at a point of comprehension with that.  i've lost the will to turn this into a lengthy diatribe. but i think this will do: moore interviews a part-time oregon patrol officer who very blatantly wears an abercrombie and fitch shirt as he quietly relays the sheepish reality of the state police force too inadequate in number to properly protect the stretch of open shoreline into the u.s. moore also focuses on flint, michigan native lila lipscomb who, standing in the kitchen of her home in one scene, explains that the multicolored cross around her neck is symbolic of religious tolerance, the many colors signifying the multifarious faiths of the world. neither she or moore, however, note its conflicting juxtaposition against the logo of her sweatshirt: the words "mickey mouse," accompanied by the familiar tricircular silhouette of the mouse of fame.   and just to let you know, which i'm sure you do, so let's call it a reminder, the borders of "environment[s] of despairing rage...[in] third-world neighborhoods of first-world cities" that tend to give rise to jihadistic presences don't end in countries relegated to, for us, distant and obscure worlds residing in the virtual universe of cnn and msnbc. a young black man moore interviews in flint comments that one day while he was watching news showcasing bombed-out areas in iraq -  - i got to thinking, there are parts of flint that look like that, and we ain't even been in a war.

       Recent work from scientists in Belgium and at the Johns Hopkins University indicates that even sperm may rely on a kind of smelling method for wending their way toward an egg. Sperm cells turn out to bear on their surface the same odor receptors stippling the nerves of the olfactory epithelium. that's wonderful. sperm can smell and i can't. i have anosmia. courtney consoled me, though -  but you can do a lot of things that sperm can't do.

      some people talked at a bar with lined faces tonight, faces not lined with age but with doing things. these two, they went to india, cairo, and the middle east. in a side conversation she and i talked about how difficult it is for a woman to travel alone, which is why she was tied to him abroad. completely drunk, but i'm not jealous of them, and wouldn't be even if i were sober. that's where it's changed. but look at how perfectly they're pieced together, whereas i'm only to follow follies like those of bukowski, i know, always a bit too late, never very lucky, and ultimately alone. i have no idea how other people do it otherwise. when they ran together down the street in the dark, leaving us behind, it was out of character for both of them but not when they were together.  he told me - me - when we dropped into one of those after-work conversations over drinks and pool tonight that the  new york times  - the  new york times  - reviewed him. the  link  won't last long, so here is what it says, and arthur is in bold: One Arab Scholar's Otherness, and Contradictions in Otherness By DAVE KEHR  Published: August 4, 2004  Filmed a few weeks before its subject's death from leukemia in September 2003, "Selves and Others: A Portrait of Edward Said" finds this Palestinian-American cultural critic in a relaxed, reflective mood as he pores over old photographs of his family and himself and reflects on the many strands that made up the fabric of his identity — or, as Said would have phrased it, his identities.  Born in Jerusalem to Palestinian parents, raised a Christian in Egypt after the founding of Israel, and a resident of the United States (his father was an American citizen) since coming here to study at a New England prep school, Said often remarked, as he does in this video documentary directed by Emmanuel Hamon, that he felt like an exile in every place he lived.  Said's personal sense of otherness is essential to his views on what he called the Other, the figure of the exotic, inscrutable Oriental as conjured by Western culture, both as a way of defining the West (as what we are not) and justifying our colonial domination of an Eastern culture defined as somehow less human, less enlightened than our own.  "Selves and Others" allows the highly articulate Said, a professor at Columbia University and an outspoken advocate of a Palestinian homeland, to lay out his views without the help of an on-screen interlocutor. Sitting at his desk at Columbia or in his study at home, Said offers a concise summary of his thought, with an emphasis on his most influential book, "Orientalism" (1978).  For an intellectual of the postmodernist school, Said shows himself to be an eminent pragmatist. "The other side isn't going away," he says of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and so it is time to abandon romantic dreams of Palestinian families returning in triumph to their olive groves and to find a new model for co-existence, "two people in one land." But even compromise has come to seem a romantic notion in the year of violence that has passed since Said's death.   Playing with "Selves and Others," which opens today at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater in the East Village, is Arthur Hurley's 39-minute documentary, "Driving an Arab Street." Mr. Hurley takes that hoary cliché of hasty journalism — the interview with the taxi driver on the way in from the airport — and turns it into something worthwhile.  Filming Egyptian cabdrivers as they make their way through the pedestrian-clogged streets of Cairo (from a front-seat camera position that recreates the favorite point of view of Iran's leading filmmaker, Abbas Kiarostami), Mr. Hurley gathers an amazing range of contradictory opinions, ranging from rabid pro-Americanism to equally fervid resentment.  This short film, made before the Iraqi war, does much to accomplish one of Said's goals by shattering the notion of a unified Arab character. The "other" we see here is, of course, composed of many, many others, each with a garrulous perspective of his own.   SELVES AND OTHERS  A Portrait of Edward Said  Directed by Emmanuel Hamon; director of photography, Nathalie Durand; edited by Anne Renardet; produced by Salem Brahimi and Wamip Films. Running time: 54 minutes.   DRIVING AN ARAB STREET  Directed by Arthur Hurley; in Arabic, with English subtitles; directors of photography, Mr. Hurley and Cyrille Joye; edited by Mr. Hurley and Anna Rowser; music by Laith Alattar; produced by Mr. Hurley and Mr. Joye; Running time: 39 minutes.  Both films released by Arab Film Distribution. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. These films are not rated.  I just realized i saw that theatre when i stopped off in new york city after the manchester primary.  but look at us, how do we end up here so after the fact. long after i've died and carried through, and the word posthumous is the worst of all. but this guy is going places somewhere in his lifetime, rest assured, something i've known for awhile. he's really, amazingly good. myself, it's not so certain.   but, relax, i said. he's 28 and you're only just 24. you've got years still and maybe it won't be very far off. but what if it is.   and, worse, never is.  a random guy asked me at a random party tonight what i'd really like to be doing. i had to break the news to him: i'm an avant-gardist. i'll always need a day job because i will never make any money from my films. beyond that, i have no idea what i'd like to do. i have nowhere to belong for all that.  he seemed uncomfortable after that. no one is ever understanding of it. i've known a filmmaker who once did, but whatever happened. it doesn't matter to me to make it in any sense, but only to have a sense of validation, even if it is todd haynes underground-style. that's all i'd want, like the people crouched inside bombed-out buildings in algiers.  so i tried to remind myself - you're playing a completely different game. no matter if the emmy award-winning boss was impressed and insisted on a grand screening for him though you sent him your links weeks ago. you're barbie dolls and karen carpenter. so no asking for anything here, though i never did to begin with. keep low and things will come - and that's not a thought or ambition; it's a nagging feeling:  while i waited for the train after leaving the five year's worth of them to another line, i leafed through the slight mass of papers leah had given me. she had pulled the  washington post  article just for me, because it reminded her of me, and remembered to bring it in only this morning. it was about years' worth of filmmakers creating music films in the underground and how these self-funded and -driven directors moved from unassuming expectations into cult followings and grandeur in longevity. i had read it immediately earlier that day so i perused the rest of the paper section she had given me and came across an article about lotte jacobi, a lost generation photographer who found her eventual home in new hampshire where she deeply engaged with the democratic national convention and where she was eventually honored in the town of manchester.  that is as much as derek lending me godard's  sympathy for the devil , where those politics of my hero-filmmaker mixed with music and parallelled so acutely with the fact of the walkmen film and of the democratic primary in january 2004 with the associated company that followed. then my train pulled up and i thought, again and not for the first time -  something is going to happen.  until then, buy a bottle of rum for tomorrow and try to pass away the night. and if i never do, try to pick up the pieces for me someday, will you, because my work will have already been done and there will be nothing more for me to do here.

      backstage, black cat. last time i had been there was way back in december with half the manchester crew. it was nothing, though. all gone away and ready for something else.  when we first stepped in the doors and made our way to the back room bar, i heard strains of dirty on purpose and bolted for the backstage door. i stopped at the door when i realized that's where you usually pay and no one was there. and that's when some guy came up to me and told me it was only soundcheck. the few people in the bar stared at me. what can i say, i'm dop hardcore. so fuck off. the guy told me with his best condescending voice to relax and enjoy the bar and i told him with my best condescending voice, yeah, thanks. courtney and i then stared through the little window in the backstage door until jin noticed and came out.  everyone looked so different. or maybe they did only because i saw them in d.c. when they're supposed to be in new york. my ticket to nyc, i kept thinking through the night for some reason. that's what i kept being displaced with. walking through today, last night feels like it never happened. it feels like a dream, and i rarely remember my dreams, so it's one of those rare, fragmented ones that i can just barely recall through slants of windowblinds to know what it felt like. today i missed everyone. like seeing unfamiliar faces in a familiar place, but looking through the mirror to see it the other way around. jin in pig-tails, enthused hellos and hugs, merch tables, pool tables. i bought a t-shirt and courtney and i donated $1 each in exchange for a sticker. gas money for schubas.  jin leaned over to me in the middle of the set and yelled into my ear, how does it feel to be at a dop concert and not film them for once? she's right. southpaw, sin-é, and pianos, and the black cat is the only time i've never filmed them. d.c. is the odd-out. all through the set i measured the timing of the songs within the film in my head, the drained grey of the black cat stage superimposed with the colors of sin-é, and i was able to anticipate songs like heartbeats, the movements and colors of the film clouding out over them in time.   i always compare drummers to matt because the walkmen are the best i've ever seen. but last night i was elated. matt keeps his cymbals low whereas the lean, tall doug puts them way up high. he keeps time like that and almost looks the opposite, seeming to outgrow his kit rather than sit inside of it. matt holds his own, though. just look and see. but dop is  good . just as good. you might not think at first, but it's two-thirds through "your summer dress" when, after a rush of noise, it gets quiet and joe sings with everyone quiet behind him before doug creeps in with the kick drum and everyone launches in again. just like that. dop has become so intense and dynamic and i was stunned watching them a few feet away. they're no longer the same people i used to know. they've been working hard, jin told me.  it's felt like i was in new york for two hours without the beginning, middle, and end i usually need and i was sad to stay as late as possible before catching the last train out of the city before midnight, cinderella-style. abbreviations are sometimes nice, though, and i'm tempted to go up to new york for the saturday show at rothko. i want to be there as much as possible when i can see films playing out in the flesh, like being able to see those old vaudeville acts come to life 80 years way after the fact, after they disappeared far before you're born. i've been focused with the walkmen mostly, but film dop is vying to be in place. i've got two lives to lead, i know, and i need to learn to be more evenly indulgent in both. eat, drink, sleep, that's the way it is.  in other highlights, i was once again reinstated as an ally sheedy lovechild when older friends, a married couple, of coworker josh happened to be friends with a friend of george's brother and made it to the show. immediately after introductions, the guy asked the question i haven't heard since my movie theatre projectionist days -   do you know who you look like?  two birds with one stone last night.

      friend and fellow w&m alumn sean wilson sent me an email late last night with the subject line "AERI!" all in caps, just like that, and this morning i read - look at this link because I sent my video in as a joke and it somehow got in:   http://www.auff.org/schedule/comedyone.html  word has it - sean's word - that our production professor at college shows sean's film and mine back-to-back to her new production students when the semester begins. zuber also showed a preliminary edit of my  ghanaian qarz  to her intro to film class the semester i was making it, to demonstrate the princicples of eisenstein's theory of montage.  coke addict  is fucking awesome, and so is sean. he likes my film, too, for which i have to give him a lot of credit. so go see  coke addict  if you're in hotlanta. if i can convince him, maybe i'll digitize and upload it.  off to the black cat to see the dirty on purpose kids. look to the right and see more.

      met with roger on sunday and he's aiming for things to look big in years to come. funny to think that, if this guy is really given a chance, he'll make it and i'll come along. he knows how to do that and i've arrived at the door before the lentil is even in place. it's a good place to be.  fell into a fortuitous conversation with coworker sandy today. she used to live in the east village in the 90s when a single-room apartment went for $600 a month. i've decided i want a studio when i go because i'm tired of dealing with people who fall out for their own legitimate reasons and because i need the editing space. and i'm already tired of strangers in the bathroom and kitchen. i've done a lot of numbers this weekend, banking on the hope that i can score a job providing the same level of income as i currently have and understanding that that might be fairly unlikely. it's a possibility, and i'll be poorer than necessary for the rent. former boss ivy did that once, rented a place on her own. she says it gets better, but i don't know. sandy lived in the city as a student, though, and waitressed her way along at high-end restaurants while she went to grad school and ran around with a camera shooting new york city girl bands. that sounds familiar. so i sent her links to my uploads with the avant-garde explanation and asked her to show me her film if she ever retrieved it from storage. she also told me about an artist friend of hers - "one of my favorite people" - who does installations and exibits all over the place. she barely gets by and now lives in brooklyn. she works part-time for an advertising firm that flies her out to places like texas to interview people on the streets for demographic insights, and it pays well. sandy is going to send me her email and give her a heads-up that i'll be writing. she said she'll also ask her friends in the city on behalf of my concerns for work and housing to add to my repertoire of nyc tips. i'm knowing the city well, far before i ever get there, and if i can muster the energy, it looks a lot better now. let go a little.

      i forgot to mention the quotable highlights of the workweek.  on the dub rack one evening there was some odd film about a sensuous woman whose closet is inhabited by an animated, talking didgeridoo. or so i think it was. the man who comes to her rescue pauses seductively at the door when she answers his knock.  dave commented, oh, those clothes are coming off.  the guy opens the door and screams as the talking thing launches into song. by this point, ghil has wandered in and pauses to watch -  what is that, a talking dildo?   ...   there's an ngs program called  animal attraction  and at work we use intakes as well as outtakes to sell to clients. the vtc (visual time code to you) copies we have of most programs are constantly in circulation between us researchers, so when a tape you need isn't on the shelf, you go hunting for it in the piles of tapes littered around everyone's editing stations, calling its name all the while. so i approached dave and asked -  dave, do you have  animal attraction ?  and as soon as it left my mouth, that was it.  dave: yes, and i have animal magnetism, too.    ...   one other thing -  last night i stopped on the history channel and watched something about sex and wwi. i have a big fetish with the great war, and no, i didn't intend the pun. i'm old soul, telescopically speaking, and date back to that, i'm almost positive. after  sex and wwi  an historical overview of wwi came along - but in color, and it was one of the most eerie things i've seen in a long time. it wasn't just tinted (color chemically added to the light areas of a black and white image by staining the celluloid base) or toned (color chemically added to the dark areas of a black and white image by staining the emulsion) like you're used to seeing in old mary pickford films, but someone got really deep down into the nuances of shades and the myriad ways colors bleed into them. overexposed images were painted with faded colors to complement the weakness of the shot accordingly and skies were drained from blue in some areas the way a sky really is on film. it was amazing. i've become so conditioned to ideas of wilfred owen and siegfried sassoon and vera britton and archduke ferdinand and ypres and verdun and the somme and (good-bye to) all that as chiaroscuro, grain-defined motion pictures in the old sense with that struggle to flicker forward, but there you could see how black the smoke was against the ocean when ships detonated explosives as they pre-emptively combed over the water for enemy mines. and young men with brown hair, blond hair, and flesh-colored skin in place of drained white. i've always had to be black and white to imagine how to occupy a place back then but now i can almost see it as a moment just like this one. the ones who got out are all dead, unless they enlisted when they were ten or so in the latter years of the war and are now in their hundreds. but it's not unlikely.  i left the tv on as i took my shower, intending to come back to it since i hadn't been able to watch much. cooking and all that. but when i came back the tv was no longer on and the remote had disappeared. i assumed my roommate came in late, turned off the tv, and took the remote for some reason. i went to bed. the next morning dionne asked if i had the remote. so we looked around, sort of like for carol anne, now that i think about it: i lifted up the comforter to look under my bed and stepped back into the living room where dionne had found it behind the cushions of a couch in lieu of the clown in the closet. so it's funny. no one else was there when i took my shower. dionne had already passed out far earlier, it turns out. i'm sure i put the remote on the table because i hadn't sat down since i was in the kitchen most of the night. and if the remote had fallen behind the cushions before i took my shower, the only time it could have, the tv was on when i left, with no one's weight to shift down and hit the remote's power button from what was surely a place of muted power signal.   at nights the air conditioning meets with the humidity of the outside to make ghost-like imprints on the glass of the back door. so i'll still keep calling november 11th armistice day on the 11th hour.
