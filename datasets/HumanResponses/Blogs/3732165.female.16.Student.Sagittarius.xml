      Ok, so I know I first had my blog at  urlLink Xanga , but I really like  urlLink Blogger  alot more. It's so much easier and look, I have a nice layout! So, all of you, I suggest you get a Blogger blog! I think it would be a nice way for all of us to keep in contact/up to date with eachother!! So, GET ONE!!! Okay, so yeah.    So if I didn't tell you, my house is officially up for sale. There's even a nice red sign out front. This Saturday we're having an open house and my parents are putting ads in alot of newspapers and stuff. I really hope this house sells and I hope we find a good house in the L'Anse Creuse school district. I was looking @  houses for sale down there on the internet the other day and I showed Tara one. It was a nice house, $400,000 though! Um, so what have you all been up to? I've been babysitting the sibs for the past few days because my parents are carpeting the basement floor, which makes the house value go up.   So, I'm getting ready to go now because I'm tired & bored. But I will leave you all with something funny that happened today. Roberta was brushing her teeth getting ready for work (at Taco Bell), Casandra walked into the bathroom and was like "ROBERTA THAT'S MY TOOTHBRUSH IN YOUR MOUTH!" LOL. Roberta was brushing with Casandra's toothbrush and has been for the past week and a half since we got back from my Grandparent's! My mom put Casandra's toothbrush in the spot Roberta's is normally in (we don't exactly have assigned spots, but Roberta begs to differ!), and Roberta just used the tooth brush even though  Roberta's toothbrush is a different color than Casandra's and their toothbrush caps are different colors too!  I guess that just proves how dumb she is! Later dudes.

      Man, I love Alpenfest! The smells, the rides, being outdoors, the laid-backness....but I hate the nasty pervy carnies! I went today (wednesday) with my family for the armbands during the day (11-4), and I was on the Tilt-A-Whirl with my little brother and one of the NASTY carnies was all "Hey, Got a name!?" And I was all...ignoring him!! NASTY, EWW, ICK.   Anywho. I worked yesterday with Mackenzie Holdershaw. And when it started storming it was just Mackenzie, Megan Murphy (not related to Molly) and the pharmacist Paul. I was vaccuuming and first the power went out, and some lady was @ the pharmacy like "I heard something about a tornado!" and my mom called and was like "You're NOT going to Alpenfest tonight because it's going to storm!" and told me that we had a severe thunderstorm warning. So I stopped vaccuuming and went up to the front of the store to help Mack get things under control. Then Doug (the owner, who was on-call w/the fire dept yesterday) came running through, gave me a flashlight in case the power went out again, and was just like "watch everyone!" It was soo scary. lol. Omg, there was a BUNCH of carnies in there! I was like 'Omg, Mack, if the lights go out again...we'll be all in the dark with nasty carnies!!" It was scary. Then @ 7, there were still people in the store so we had to stay. So once everyone left from the front of the store, Mack &amp; I closed things down and then Donna (owner's wife/pharmacist..she came back to help) let us leave.Well, it was raining extremely hard when we left and I got *soaked* on the way to the van..like 2 feet from the door. Then, when we were driving home, some of the streets were flooding onto the sidewalk!! It was really scary. When I got home (it took like 20 minutes to get from the drugstore to my house!), I found out my uncle Tim who lives in Petoskey had called my mom and was all freaking out like "are you guys okay!" because Petoskey got hit hard w/storms and he heard we were too. Yeah. We were okay though. Lol.   So, yeah. COMMENT. COMMENT. (To comment, click on the word 'Comment' by my name. ;))

      So, my aunt & uncle have moved to Florida. Neat, eh? Well, they're bugging us to come & see them so my parents are thinking about going down   maybe   in August. I hope we do. They moved to Cape Coral. Even the name sounds beautiful. My aunt & uncle want us to move down there actually. And really, I'm not objecting to it. So my parents decided that   if   we go down, if we like it, well maybe we'll move. Maybe not though.    Anywho, yesterday my uncle Tim and cousins Ezra and Derrek, and my uncle's foster kids David, Dustin, Lanelle and some other guy were supposed to come over with my grandma. Well, my grandma had diarhea (sp) so she couldnt come and then my stupid cousin Ezra (what a nut!) was throwing a big time fit so they couldnt come. And they couldnt come today because theyre busy. Grr, i was sooo mad.   I've been having a bad day. Seriously. I cut myself sooo bad in the shower shaving. Like, I have never bled so much from a cut before. It was gushing down my leg like crazy. I was screaming and banging on things and like "I NEED A BAND AID!" and my mom came running in like "Are you okay!" and then i showed her my cut and she was like "Ouch!" cuz it was bad! Then I was straightening my hair and dropped the curling iron on my shoulder so now i have a nice big red burn mark. I seriously am just...so injured today.   I was really bored so I washed the car. It was pretty fun. I cleaned it too. Vaccuum and all. It likes nice, if i must say so myself. Oh yeah, does anybody want to go to the Queen's Pageant and then maybe the dance under the Pavillion @ Alpenfest on Tues? If so, call me or let me know. You can comment in the spot where it says comments below ;).    So, everyone, have a nice day, get a  urlLink Blog , and comment on mine!

      I'm so glad that I don't have to work today! I was so excited when Lyndsey asked to switch me tomorrow for Friday. So on Friday I work 9-5 (KENDRA) if somebody (KENDRA) wants to come (KENDRA) and get and application (KENDRA) and have lunch w/me (KENDRA). Tomorrow @ 2:00 I have an appointment to get my hair cut, styled & highlighted. I think I am going to get light brown and red put in, but I am not positive. But it better turn out good, cuz it'll be costing me $90! Oh, and I'm not gonna wash my hair either b/c I can get it washed there, it's in the $90, and so yeah. I'm really excited. I wish I was going today. Roberta has an appointment @ 3:30 to get her hair cut. She told me that she wants to get just the TIPS of her hair dyed PINK. Crazy! I told her I wouldnt talk to her if she did. Plus my parents wouldnt let her.    Oh, Casandra doesn't live with us anymore, so Beth I'm not sure if Dan will work with her. She got kicked out of the house for lying to my parents and me (that's a no no), and seeing this PIECE OF F*CKING TRASH named Seth that my parents (AND I) did not like. But of course there is more to the story. But the bottom line is that she does not live here anymore. For the moment she is living with my grandma. So yeah. I'm mad @ her and don't care anymore. But I'm really tired now & my head hurts and I want my uncle to come over to get my cousin Derrek (he spent the night last night), and bring his boys!!! lol. See ya.

      Oh, my computer is soooo gay!! Seriously, I am NOT kidding. Okay, anyway, yeah. Tara and Kendra came to see me today! It was fun! :) You guys should do that more often! Or maybe I should just get one of you a job there. That would be neat. I work on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week so when I see the owner, Doug, I'll tell him to hire one of you because we seriously need some more help! Oh, Jillian Iannucci came in today to the drugstore like right before we closed with two of her aunts (they are SOOOO cool!!!) but Jill was telling me about her stalker! OMG, it's soo creepy, I feel bad for her. But that's what you get for giving people who follow you in Wal*Mart you phone number!! Crystal Spehar came in today, too. And I saw Alex Aiello & Melissa McMillan at Burger King. And I saw Travis driving (but I saw him 2 times last week). My sister saw Mark Bliss. I'm jealous :(. Tomorrow is our Open House. Look for my house in the classifieds of the Herald tomorrow, and the Detroit Freepress tomorrow and Sunday, I think. Dude, I hope we sell our house. It's not because of you guys, just because my entire family would  just be sooo much happier down there. Like, seriously. I'm just a city girl at heart. So, Yeah. Now for a few individuals (sorry if you don't get one, I'm very tired, it's 11:28PM and I had to work all day).      Kendra  : I work on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday...and Keri doesn't, so you should come up on one of the days (or more if you'd like) and we can get lunch or something. Oh and sure you can help my dye my hair blue! lol. Of  course  it turns guys on, why else would I do it?!?! lol!! Oh, and I hope I have a good time with Adam!! lol, and maybe he's shaved by now!!     Tara  : I really liked that annoying thing. Have you decided anything for your birthday?     Heather  : What are you doing for your birthday?   Later days guys. Have a good summer. CALL ME!!!
