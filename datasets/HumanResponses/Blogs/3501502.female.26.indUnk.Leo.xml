       That's what I've been doing today.  Well, I can't say that.  I can really only clean while Brian sleeps, since he goes behind me and ruins everything I do.  So, during his nap, I tackled the boys' room.  Did you know there's actually a floor under all those toys?  Hehehehe  Their room is looking much better.  Still will need a couple of hours to finish it up and vacuum it all.  Then I get to move on to the living room.  Aren't I industrious.  At the moment the boys are enjoying having an even partially cleaned room, and no doubt destroying all of my hard work.  But that's OK, because I'm dropping them off at the sitter's tomorrow morning so that I can have a bit of peace and quiet while I clean.    Yes, the most exciting thing that happens in my life is cleaning.  I'm  such  a homebody.  Yesterday proved once again that the mini steam cleaner was a good buy.  This time, Brian poured syrup on the couch.  Steamer to the rescue, and Brian to time out.  Now, if he'd just quit playing in the fish tank...  LOL.  Just ran the spell check on this post.  It's suggestion for homebody: amoeboid.  How odd.

        urlLink Nablus ,West Bank:   Israelis conduct raid after foiled bombing   Israeli soldiers blew open doors with grenades, rummaged through closets and rounded up residents yesterday while searching for fugitives and bomb labs in Nablus' old city — the largest army operation in the militant stronghold in more than a year.   Earlier in the week, an 18-year-old from Nablus, recruited by Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a militant group with ties to Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, to blow himself up in Jerusalem, was caught at an Israeli checkpoint; soldiers later found his explosives in a school bag. The army said the raid was triggered, in part, by that arrest.    urlLink Fun Factoids , such as: The Democrats are complaining about how long the war is taking, but it took less time to take Iraq than it took Janet Reno to take the Branch Davidian compound -- a 51-day operation.

       I had an interesting day today.  Cleaned the big fish tank while Brian napped.  Made escargot.  =-)  Snails were taking over the tank again...  So, I emptied it as much as possible, put 2 snails in with the contained fish, and poured boiling water into the tank.  Instant "kill-a-snail" and great for algae.  DC helped me clean the tank.  He thought it was great, especially the catching the fish part.  And I found the empty shell from one large snail that he loved.  And has since lost.  Oh well.  But, the big tank is clean once again.  Had the door to the deck open the entire time, and Rose enjoyed going out and watching the birds.  She didn't try to jump off or anything.  Isn't that great?  Anyway, finally picked the van up today.  Jennifer had a flat tire and had to take her car in, but she didn't want to fill it up with air while it was raining, or worse, change it, so it was kinda late when she picked me up.  It pretty much rained all day.  Yech!  So, came home, Brian decided to take a nap, and DC wanted some Mommy time, so I sat down to watch the Kim Possible movie with him.  And what should I see but Rose hopping around on the back deck.  I could have sworn that she was inside when I locked the door!  She was locked out there for several hours and she didn't jump!!!!  Feeling guilty, I went to let her in and noticed what she was actually doing while hopping around.  She was chasing a lizard.  She actually caught it, and seeing me standing at the door, sauntered over with it held in her mouth, tail and not much else sticking out.  My response: Nope!  I told her quite clearly that there was no way she was bringing that in the house and if she wanted to eat it she could do so out there.  DC, watching all this and jumping around, thought it was very cool.  Especially when our darling cat decided to let the little lizard go so that she could chase it again!  DC was shrieking and the cat was hopping.  It was very fun.  Anyway, the lizard finally got away, despite (or perhaps because of) DC's attempts to help Rose locate it, and Rose came inside, where she showed how pleased she was with herself for being the great brown-tiger hunter by jumping on the back of the couch and purring in my ear.  She  so  wants to go to Rosehill!  Sitting watching the movie, DC cuddled into my side and Rose prowling the couch, and what does she do?  She finds the bowl of grated cheddar cheese that the boys snacked on earlier.  More than that, she  eats  some of it!  OK, for those of you who have never met Rose, I should probably explain a little about why this is so odd.  Rose is about six years old, and spoiled rotten.  And we didn't do it, honest!  She was abandoned at a rental property and knowing that the Cannons are always willing to expand bloodlines, the owners of the property brought her and another cat to us.  She adopted me the second I rubbed her belly.  She was on my knees and just rolled backwards until she was on her back and sort of curled around the hand petting her.  Other bit of interesting information about her, she looks like Mrs. Norris.  Yep, she's Filch's cat, but without the red eyes.  Well, OK, maybe Rose is a little lighter than Mrs. Norris, but you get the idea.  She's also just about the softest cat in the world.  There's a woman somewhere in the US that accepts pet hair to make yarn and thread with and then makes apparel for the owner.  Rose would be a perfect candidate for this (if I didn't find it oddly gross to wear my pet).  Anyway, I'm rambling.  The point is, Rose is an odd cat.  I know, that's a redundancy.  She's odd even for a cat.  She has no sense of balance (she's fallen off the windowsill at least eight times in one day before), her preferred method of being held is to be cradled like a baby, and she turns up her nose at wet cat food, cat treats, and pretty much any form of human food.  The only thing we've ever seen her eat, other than her dry food, is a bit of ham that we gave her.  We had to lay it on the floor at her feet and then ignore her for her to eat that.  She's just an odd cat!    Of course, she is a constant source of entertainment, what with the falling out of the windowsill and waking up half-way to the ground.  She always tries to pretend that it was her intention all along.  She also fell off the marimba the other night, after trying to find a foothold on a couple of keys.  The sound of it playing woke me up.  As soon as I figured out what the noise was, I started laughing.

       Not much going on here as everyone knows. Thought I would stop off and say hi though. We are doing a fair amount of training which I approve of in general, even if it does make for odd schedules. I'll tell ya'll more when I can, but for now the best news I've gotten is that it is much more pleasent, environmentally, to be in Iraq then here. TTYL.

       Yes, my boy did call me yesterday.  It was very good to hear his voice, especially because he is so upbeat.  He is at Camp Udairi, in northwestern Kuwait, near the Iraqi border.  I found a couple of photos of Camp Udairi on the web.  This first photo shows the camp entrance, and the scenic view.    Here is another scenice view with some of the native wildlife.    And yes, as Jo mentioned in the  post below, I am flying the Kuwaiti flag while he is in Kuwait.  It is flying on Kate's flag pole at the fork of the driveway.  I will switch to the Iraqi flag when he goes there.  Other flags flying for him are our Blue Star Service Flag, and a Polk's Corps battle flag (his favourite Confederate flag).  All, along with the US flag on the main pole, are flying at half-staff during this mourning period for President Reagan.

       Dev took a chance an called at almost 6 am.  Luckily, I was awke and got to talk to him for a few minutes and wish him happy Father's Day.  He's doing well, a little bored at the moment.  They're redoing the training they did over here, mainly just for something to do.  10th Mountain just finally arrived, and instead of training at their home base, they're going to do the training in Kuwait.  Which means they got two weeks of leave before deploying while our guys trained.  Kinda interesting the differences in attitudes, huh?  Apparently they're doing urban combat training at the moment, using 3-4 "dinky little buildings."  Dev laughs because while the training is fun, they're used to doing it in a permanent city.  Latest rumors are that they're not going to move to Iraq for another 20-30 days.  And another seven thousand guys are supposed to arrive at the camp today, so there's a chance he won't be able to get on-line or a chance to use the phone.  On-line is the more likely mode of communication, because it's cheaper and the lines are shorter.  $5/hr and 30 minute lines compared to $15/hr and 2 hour lines.  He sounds good, though.  Spirits are up.  Not that I was particularly worried, but it's good to hear his voice and  know  for sure.  And I'm sure that he told me other stuff that I should pass on.  Actually, I'm pretty sure that I messed some bit of information up already...  Lack of sleep with do that to you, but babies who think grinding their heads into you is sleepy cuddles and little boys who wake up screaming about robot baby heads make sleep difficult.  As does the sound of the cat falling off the maribma, a noise that woke me up from a dead sleep and made me laugh once I figured out that it wasn't one of the kids banging on it.  She tried to scramble away from the edge, I guess, and ended up "playing" the keys.  And now he's thrilling his Papa by wishing him happy Father's Day.  Devereaux Jr. has been flying the Kuwaiti flag in honor of his boy.  And I'm off to try to catch a few more Zs.  PLease forgive any spelling errors today.  I just don't feel like dealing with the blob's spell check, which does not recognise so many words that it's not funny.

       It was only 90 degrees today ( ONLY! ), but with the heat index, it felt like 97.  Walking from the commissary to the van was enough to make us all feel sick to our stomachs.  Brian has declared that I am officially the Meanest Mommy in the Universe!  I withheld the second pint of blueberries from him out of sheer spite, I made him get in and out of the hot van, I wouldn't let him use the end table to propel himself onto the couch.  I'm just  mean !  We actually had a pretty good day.  I put off going to the store as long as possible, waiting for Dev to come online, since I had been at the library when he was available Friday.  Of course, that meant he never came on-line.  Nora did the same thing.  Had pizza for lunch and fish and chips for dinner.  My diet is shot all to hell.  Must get back on diet.  Must get back on diet.  Must resist the urge to stop at McDonald's just because I'm hungry and don't want to wait in line to get on base.  Just finished talking to Jennifer a few minutes ago.  She's holding it together, which is always good.  We made plans to drop the van off at Goodyear Tuesday and then go swimming.  The boys should have a blast.  We borrowed a video about ants from the library.  DC has watched it about 6 times now.  He likes ants (this week, at least, next week may be a different story).  He especially likes that ants  like  to be counted.  The things you tell your children in order to give them something to do for a moment.  Oh, but the video (part of the Bug City series) has a seagull puppet named Bugsy seagull!  Someone thought they were being especially witty when they came up with that.    I've been flipping between listening to an 80s station and a country station on Yahoo's Launchcast radio.  I've said it before, and I will say it again: today's country music is the same as 80s rock.  Seriously, the similarities are scary.  Actually, I'm really enjoying listening to the 80s station.  It's music I can remember coming from Jacque's room growing up.  Dad didn't particularly like rock, and while he didn't forbid Jacque from listening to it (not that she would have obeyed), he didn't want to hear it.  So there was always something a bit illicit about hearing the sounds of Madonna, U2, and Guns-N-Roses wafting from the wall.  Listening to it now brings some of those feelings back.  Hey, I have to get my thrills somehow, right?  Just found out that my neighbor kid will be gone for two weeks (I'm assuming block leave).  Getting someone to mow the grass in the interim is no problem.  Kids literally go door to door offering to do it.  Of course, if he's still gone when I decide to make my way east, life gets a little more complicated.  I was planning on paying him in advance to do the lawn and water my plants, maybe get his parents to let in any AC maintenance guys who have to do their routine thing.  I'm sure I can get my downstairs neighbor to do it instead.  Her husband just got back from deployment, and she left for quite some time as well, so I'm sure she knows the routine.  Brian has also decided that I don't feed him enough.  And that fish food is a good substitute for human food.  He used the rocking chair to grab the container off the top of the tank,  twice , and proceeded to scatter the flakes all over the place.  While I have no proof that he ate it, tomorrow I'm sure I'll be subjected to interesting diapers.  At the moment, both boys are on the couch.  Brian is sleeping on one end and DC is fighting sleep on the other.  He's taken to carrying Figaro, the cat from "Pinocchio" around with him.  Well, the stuffed one I bought for Dev because he missed having a cat and our apartment complex didn't allow animals.  But, that was my day.  Thrilling, huh?

       Just got off ICQ with The Urch.  ATM it seems he has a little while after dinner to get on-line.  PT is at 3:30 a.m., so pretty soon after dinner, he is done with on-line and headed to bed, LOL.  FWIW, it is 8 hours later in Kuwait than it is in CDT.  If you have comments, questions, or wishes for the day that you want on the blog, judge the timing accordingly.  Of course, the schedule will change by next week, no doubt.  He sounds fine; not much going on until the rest of their crew arrives, just jet lag recovery and the like.

       Well, since Nora expounded on her day, I might as well, too.  The day started at around 7.  I left Brian sleeping in bed and got DC settled, only to be meowed at by the cat.  You have to understand, about the only time Rose meows is when she's sick or desperately wants something.  This morning it was access to the laundry room, and therefore her food, water, and litter box.  Instead of taking my time to wake up like I normally do, I rushed the trash and recycling out to the curb, a process that made me extremely happy I'm not allergic to bees since the curb is shadowed by a mimosa tree.  But I missed the recycling truck last week, and the milk bottles were taking over, so down to the curb I went.  About five minutes after I had gotten back in, the weather decided that it was time for our daily shower.  You have to understand, in LA, a daily shower isn't a little pattering of rain.  No, it knocks the satellite dish out, and lasts anywhere from 5-30 minutes.  A pleasant break from the unrelenting heat, but adds to the humidity something awful.  From there it was pretty normal.  Rose climbed into my lap and shed all over me.  I just had her in my lap a few minutes ago and tufts of hair floated away.  Did dishes and used my new spot carpet shampooer to clean some of the places the kids have spilled food and drink over the last year.  It worked pretty well, not as good as a steam vac you rent, but good enough to deal with the Rocky Road ice cream mess Brian created today.  DC, being four and a boy, has discovered his penis, and has decided he doesn't like the glans.  He wants me to take it off.  Stop laughing.    Dev and I talked a little bit over e-mail, then came the scramble to find the list of passwords that Brian had grabbed off my desk so that I could go to the Army AKO page and use their IM system to chat with him, while trying to listen to First Tennessee's automated menu in order to get a new PIN number for the credit card he took with him.  Didn't manage to get into AKO before he got off the computer, but I feel better having talked to him.  Several baths, a nap (for Brian), a movie (for me),at least one showing of  Harry Potter an' th' Rock , and hours trawling the net for usable pictures for some fanart, and the day has ended.  DC announced at 9 that he was tired and he wanted his Snake Juice.  He was asleep about five minutes after he finished the bottle.  Brian is happily eating watermelon, and trying to share it with me as I type.  Rose is lying down in a box lid, desperately asking for her own cat bed.  Maybe one of those ones that attach to a window sill...  She'd still fall off, but the occurrence rate would be reduced, I think.  All in all, a good day, I think.

       And as is probably the case with most families, a typical day is a rarity around here.  Conundrum, huh?    Up early to tend to the household and personal stuff, then a little e-mail and news before Kate woke up.  Two hours of language arts (I read Ella Enchanted to her to be precise).  Cooked breakfast, while she checked on her Neopets.  There was a new game that required some strategy.  Over breakfast, we discussed a bit about how the game might work best.  Kate played it for a while, but didn't seem satisfied, so quit to write a letter (Yes - pen and paper!  Interesting that because she has free access to e-mail and to stationery, she picks which is best for her purpose).  I was banned from the game and the letter, so plugged away at the iconography of the dolphin for the high school kids at Vacation Bible School.   Kate and I worked on our little project for Father's Day.  It was either raining or steaming all day, so we didn't go outside to speak of.  I wish we could have, because the phone rang at least once an hour with Vacation Bible School stuff, including getting criminal background checks on all my volunteers.  On the other hand, the phone calls meant that I was sitting by the computer when Jo ICQ'd the news that the Urch landed safely in Kuwait!  Such a relief.  No reason to worry about the flight per se, but still.    Jo's report inspired me to click around for a bit of news which might still be at the internet link when the Urch gets a chance to look.  I need better Israel/Palestinian sources.  The ones we read tend to lose their permalinks pretty fast.    The afternoon reading session somehow didn't quite happen, probably because Kate got so interested in the music take home package from the library that we missed the usual time.  She is really bearing down on the music right now because she wants the harp lessons so much.  I have a good lead on a harp teacher who is actually in this county, rather than the ones who are 50 miles away.  He is out of town this week, but another unschooler, who has studied violin with him, gives a big thumbs up, both for musical skill and for being unschool friendly.    ATM Kate is watching an Animal Planet shark rescue program and embroidering a tea towel.  She is frustrated with her knitting and hasn't touched either the sampler project or the scarf since last Friday.  She had just gotten a goodly amount on the scarf done; it was her first "real" project and used yarn she had picked out knowing how it would look.  She took it with her to a friend's house to show the friend how to knit.  Friend's dog chewed up the needles; Friend's mom stuffed the whole mess into a plastic bag, with no effort to rethread before moving.  Kate has unravelled 3 rows now trying to find one that she can rethread, but with no success and increasing despair that she will be able to save 2 weeks worth of knitting work.  Friend Husband has SAR tonight, so we are in that relaxed routine of frozen pizza "after a while", then early to bed to read.  I am enjoying ticking through the "household status check" while posting.    Five kittens, 1 fuzzy white caterpillar, untold seamonkeys (including the ecosystem sealed ones Jo got the Urch 5 years ago) and Percy are in the house, but all of the garden transplants are out of the house and in the garden.    I need to start the next round of squash and maybe 8 more Roma bush bean plants.  I won't want "mess of beans" quantity in the garden when the eggplants and peppers are plentiful, but it sure is nice to grab a cup of them to "go with" a pasta estiva dish.  On the other hand, there is no pressing need to do laundry, grocery shop, or leave the hill tomorrow.  If we do it will be by choice.    The grass is out of control and the chicken house rank, but neither can be helped in a week that has had daily, pouring rain.  Truthfully, the chicken house "could" be helped, but I am reinforcing three states of matter with Kate right now.  Fully saturated chicken manure under a wheel barrow of fouled bedding is another state of matter altogether, far beyond my scientific interest to explain or experience.  And that's the rambling news from Rosehill, where the man is good looking, the children make us proud, and the animals shed.

       This just came into my inbox.   We are safely in Kuwait. Not all that much going on yet; although, I have found a couple of things for the boys and will send them if  can figure out how. We haven't gotten any useful info like mailing addresses or such and rumors abound. Looks like we may stay in Kuwait a while but that is just one of many rumors and we have no way of confirming anything. Let everyone know we're safe here and tell the kids I love them.  Love, Dev

       Hey, all:  Dev loaded onto a bus at 11:45 this morning to go to Iraq.  He had about 3 hours of family time before leaving, which was basically just us hanging out at the Company.  There were a few tears, of course, but he left in good spirits.  I didn't actually stick around for the goodbye ceremony or watch the buses load and leave.  I figured those would make me lose it and I didn't want to upset the kids.  The next year will be confusing enough for them, I think, they don't need to see Mommy have a nutty.  (And that's a perfectly good phrase, Dev.  It describes the event rather well, I think.)

       DC and Brian have seen  Braveheart  one too many times and have decided to be William Wallace...  Or they could have just had too much fun with sidewalk chalk.        I'm not sure I really want to know how DC got the blue mark right over his eye.  At least sidewalk chalk doesn't have a point, right?

       Yes, the Deployment Ceremony was today, but I decided not to take the camera since I had to deal with both of the boys in the heat.  And, let me tell you, Brian once again demonstrated his lack of fear by running all over the place, in between other people, and through one man's legs (while chasing the man's grandson[?], if that makes it any better).  Our friend Jennifer was there.  Yes, Porn Convention Jennifer. (If you haven't heard that story, I will post it eventually.  Sorry, Jennifer, it's too funny not to share.)  And she was amazed at Brian's lack of any self-preservation.  I swear, I could hold him off the patio by his ankles and he'd just laugh.

       Well, we did our layout to make sure everyone has what they need today. Our deployment ceremony is tommorrow at 10 o'clock. I believe that today was our last long day since, we have now moved everything out of the company. It looks like we'll be off after the ceremony tommorrow and most, and maybe all, of the weekend. Jo should have some good pictures to put up from the ceremony. We had a good week of training and I think it will pay off. That's it for now.

       Not much is happening at the moment.  Dev is in and out of the field for training.  Got to come home for a couple of hours tonight for a hot meal and a shave.  Then it was back to the slave pit.  DC started VBS today, which was an interesting experience.  They had internet sign-up as one of their options, and that's the one I chose.  Problem is, internet sign-ups don't always work well, and every time I tried to call to check to make sure it went through, no one answered the phone.  So, as I knew would happen, my registration was one of the ones that didn't go through.  But, they found a place for him, and he was happy.    Brian fell asleep 20 minutes before we had to pick DC up, though.  And then fought finishing his nap for the longest time.  Also bought a couple of Father's Day presents for Dev.  Trying to figure out what he can use, or possibly take with him, is not the easiest thing.  And, that was my day.  The boys were bunctious, I cooked dinner, and Dev and I watched some TV.  Don't we have an exciting life?

       Dev received all sorts of equipment in the last couple of days, and has been slowly sorting through it and packing it all away.  He's also been treating his uniforms with insecticide, which is fun fun fun, as you can imagine.  Here's a picture of Dev in his Mushroom Helmet.  Sorry it's not a very good pic.  Cheapo digital cameras are nice, but aren't up to my camera's standards.  Good for quick things like this, though.     He had an interesting morning today.  On his way to PT, he blew a tire when he hit a pothole.  So, instead of exercising this morning, he got to go to Wally World to get new tires and an oil change.  Apparently all the tires had steel showing.  *winces*  DC has been particularly odd today.  He has been carrying his Teddy around and demanding Snake Juice for more than just going to sleep.  He even demanded that Teddy have his own Snake Juice bottle.  Luckily, he accepted the idea that teddies drink pretend juice, and an empty bottle was fine for that.  For those of you who don't know, Snake Juice is DC's special bottle.  It's one of the ones that have a bend in it to help keep air out of baby tummies.  Since it has a "curve" he decided it looked like a snake.  It was very confusing the first few times he requested it, as you can probably imagine.  Kinda like "Gold, with cheese, an' you eat it."  That's DC speak for omelet.  From the looks of things, I'm not going to get DC into a daycare.  Had to cancel the Child Development Center (CDC - Am I the only one who finds that acronym, and it's association with the Center for Disease Control, humorous?)  today because DC's old doctor never sent up any of his records.  Not even the shot record.  May have to go home to TN just to argue with them in person.  Yes, I know, I went to Knoxville at Christmas to pick up his records.  Didn't realize until it was too late that the hospital didn't have a copy of the shots.  *rolls eyes*  I hate bureaucracies.  VBS starts next week, though.  He should enjoy that.  Brian, for his part, as been very almost two today.  He has an irritation, and so I left his diaper off for a little bit.  He's apparently decided that he enjoys the freedom and has come running to me with a naked butt about 3 times in the last half hour.  Now, if he'd only go to sleep...  (Very much not holding my breath on that one.)  Dev and I are discussing when to take DC to see the new Harry Potter movie.  If Dev does have parts of next weekend off, we'll go then.  As it stands now, I'm the meanest Mommy in the world because the extras disk in the  Chamber of Secrets  box is obviously  Harry Potter: P'isn'r of Ice-a-band  and out of pure spite I won't let him watch it.

       We can now post updates from the parental units - and the baby sister who has strong opinions about her brother's safety and care while in the Sandbox.    She wants to send out mailing labels for care packages.  I made her address labels for postcards while on holiday this winter, which she liked a lot.  If you want mailing labels for care packages (or ideas for the content thereof), leave a comment.  We will send you mailing labels, courtesy of Kate's good idea.

       The last couple of days have basically been taken up with recovering from the weekend.  Which means lots of sleep for us all.  DC actually went to sleep at around 5 pm last night, and while he did wake up for a couple of hours around 8, he still went back to be easily.  And Brian didn't keep me up until 1, which is always a blessing.  Now, if only he'd let me clip his nails...  There was also an FRG meeting tonight.  For those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the life of a military spouse (yes, Nora, they do train us), FRG means Family Readiness Group.  Dev says that "it's the wives club with a semi-official mission."  And, he is right.  FRG is a monthly meeting were the chain of command gives us any relevant information and we bring up any problems we may be having.  In theory, it's a good thing.  In practice...  In non-deployment times, at least, it's waste of time unless you feel like being catty.  I much prefer the Enlisted Wives Club, which is much more laid back and social, which FRG isn't allowed to be, for some bureaucratic reason.  Anyway, the meeting was pretty typical for an FRG meeting.  There was a nice little brief on Iraq and the current situation there.  We are not really being told anything, because of Operational Security.  Therefore, I can't tell you anything.  The little I know is enough to fill a thimble, and very little of that can be passed along.  Here's what I  can  tell you:  There will be a deployment ceremony on June 11th.  Apparently, they will have a few retirees from the last time the 509th was deployed in a war zone, WWII.  He will be basically off from the 11th until he deploys.  And I won't know he's gone until he doesn't come home for dinner, which will be   very   stressful, I think.  On a side note, Dev's trying on his new helmet.  He looks like he has a mushroom on his head.  I understand that it's a better helmet because it's stronger, lighter, and has "cushions that wick away moisture" (Dev seems thrilled by this), but it still looks funny.  I'll send you his mailing address as soon as I have it, which probably won't be until he's in Iraq.  I'll also post a list of acceptable things you can send in care packages once I have it.  I know some things you can't send, like porn and pork products, but a complete list will be helpful.  And, FRG is setting up a website that will have the latest news, photos of the guys, and the like.  I'll post it as soon as I get it.  And, that's all for today.  If you have any questions, send them to me and I'll pass them along to Dev to get answers if I don't know off the top of my head.

       Where both living and learning occur 24 hours a day.  This is the personal blog of the Cannon family, used to keep up to date on DDC3's actions in Iraq, and for him to easily see what his family has been up to while he's gone.  I'm Joleen, your hostess.  I just got back from taking Devereaux, Nora, and Kate to the Alexandria airport.  I had to wake up at 3 am for that little endeavor.  Not fun, at all.  But, for the most part we all had a good time this weekend.  They got in Friday afternoon and DC and Brian were thrilled to have them.  Brian, despite the fact that he hadn't seen his grandparents in about six months went right up to them and gave them a big hug.  Nora insists that I'd been coaching him.  It's not true.  He's just that cute.  Saturday was the big birthday day.  We combined the boys' birthdays until one big party in honor of Dev leaving and the grandparents being here.  To say that there was an abundance of presents would be an understatement.  I don't even want to think about how much money we spent on the boys, much less the combined cost of all the presents and party supplies.  It was a hit.  Sunday Dev decided that he wanted to show his parents "The Box."  Now, if you've never talked to Dev about what he does down here in the Armpit of the Army, you have no idea what the Box is.  Basically, it's where he goes and pretends to be a Palestinian, Iraqi, or other insurgent for the Army boys to practice on.  The Box contains several small towns and other various things to make it interesting.    It gives him an interesting perspective.  The Army has trained him to be a terrorist, basically, and now he's going off to fight terrorists.    Anyway, Sunday was Box day.  We drove around, trying to show them Sugart-Gordan and letting them admire the signs written in Arabic and English.  Dev had a great deal of fun pointing out where some of his more fun stories have taken place.  Unfortunately, Shugart-Gordan was closed, so they didn't get to see much more than woods, wild horses, and the Geranimo Drop Zone.  And it's at the DZ that all the fun really happened.  Dev, in his infinite wisdom, figured that if a Humvee can go around the DZ, our lighter van should have no problem.  It slipped his mind that Humvees are meant to go off-roading and full-sized vans are not.  Humvees, while heavier, also have tires that support their weight in sand.  Guess what?  Our van doesn't.    The first time...  Yes, the  first  time, we got stuck, we got out pretty easily.  Dev, who was driving, decided that we should try the other sand road, because surely the less steep of the two hills would be better.  We, of course, got stuck.  So, Dev floored the gas, trying to back out of the problem.  Apparently, no one told him that that was the wrong thing to do.  By the time he gave up on that idea, the rear axle was buried.  So, Nora, Kate, the boys, and I walked around the airfield, finding interesting things that the soldiers had left behind.  Kate reminded her brother not to leave tabasco sauce laying around in Iraq, because that will tell the bad guys that he was there.    After an hour and forty minutes, they both had a nice little collection including something we thought was a gas cap, some type of practice round, and all sorts of artillery shells.  And were very disappointed to find that they were allowed to take none of it out of the Box because it is all considered property of the US Army.    Monday, Memorial Day, was much more laid back, especially for me.  I stayed home while the rest went in search of a swimming hole.  They didn't find one, and the paddle boat rental was closed, so that frustrated Kate greatly.  A lazy evening helped all around, though, and Devereaux greatly enjoyed the ginger chicken I had made for dinner.  And, that was our weekend.  Doesn't it sound like we had fun?

       Since my husband was sparse with the details.&nbsp;   Books: Make sure you send paperbacks.&nbsp; Most likely he will leave the books in Iraq for the next set of soldiers and he feels less guilty about doing that with paperbacks than hardbacks.&nbsp; He likes pretty much anything sci-fi related, military history/fiction, authors like Morgan Llywelyn and Harry Turtledove are good as well.  Comfort Items:&nbsp; Gee, he couldn't be any vaguer there, could he.&nbsp; Things like CDs (country or classical), magazines, and whatnot.&nbsp; Once again, keep in mind that these are things that may never make it back.&nbsp; The desert sand is supposed to be very hard on electrical equipment.&nbsp; If you feel so inclined, he has a Gameboy Advance there.&nbsp; No DVD player because he doesn't want to spend $100 on something that might not last a year there.  A few things he didn't mention:    Single serving packs of food that he can take on guard with him.&nbsp; He likes any type of fruit, but not pudding.  Hard candy is better than chocolate, which melts in the heat.  He likes Little Debbie Star Crunches (which, I know, I said no chocolate...).  Toys for the local kids are good for relations.&nbsp; Not anything fancy; buy a bucket of cheap dinos at the store and seperate it into individual bags so that he can just reach in his pocket and give out a few to each kid.&nbsp; No toy soldiers or guns or anything like that.&nbsp; Cheap toy cars maybe?&nbsp; You get the idea.  Packages take about a month to reach him, so don't send anything that might mold before then.&nbsp; Check out the Oconus site ( urlLink http://www.oconus.com/main/carepackages.asp ) for more care package ideas.&nbsp; Though, if anyone sends him "motivational pair of panties" we're likely to have words.&nbsp; =-)  I can't think of anything else right now.&nbsp; I'm sure Nora will add to the list when she wakes up and drinks some coffee.

       So, I'll post a few things here. Stuff to send... Books, no real selection here. Most everythin is comfort items, just don't load me down with things that I'll be annoyed if I can't bring back to the states. Everything else is pretty good here. Glad everyone is havng fun with the geneology stuff and it loks like ya'll are coming across some interesting stuff. TTFN

       It's 9:45.  Brian is melting down to a nap.  Kate isn't yet up.  DC is eating another peach (glad he is toilet trained). The den floor is covered with Mr. Potato Head and K'nex.  The pieces aren't entirely interchangeable, but close enough to satisfy Brian.  DC has gotten to where he can build almost alone anything he sees in the K'nex book.  Mirabile dictu, neither the washing machine nor the diswasher has been run yet.

       Way back before walkers were considered dangerous by the Powers that Be, I had one, like most toddlers of the time.&nbsp; The house we lived in in New York had a bunch of stairs, and in order to protect my little brainpan, my parents installed a child safety gate at the top of the stairs.&nbsp; Apparently it didn't take me long to figure out that gate, and in no time I had taken my "perfectly safe" walker down the flight of stairs.&nbsp; My mother came running, as all good mothers do, only to find me on the landing, laughing my little diapered butt off.&nbsp; I did this again and again until my walker broke, despite my parents' efforts to protect me.&nbsp; As a result, when it came time for them to pick out a CB handle for me, my parents dubbed me the Roller Coaster Kid.   Ever since, I've enjoyed coasters, bumpy roads when sitting in the back of the bus, and other things of the same ilk.   Tonight,&nbsp; I experienced a fraction of what my own mother must have felt when I first launched my walker.&nbsp; I say only a fraction because I didn't actually witness the second generation of the 'Coaster Kid.&nbsp;   I was downstairs, making my bed while Nora did dishes and the kids played.&nbsp; Kate and DC were trapping each other in a blanket and Brian had decided to play with the ride-on toy affectionately known as the Barneymobile.&nbsp; As I was making the bed, I heard the clatter of the toy going down the stairs, but since I didn't hear any squeals accompanying the noise, I didn't really think anything of it.&nbsp; A few minutes later Nora came down to tell me that the noise  was  indeed the Barneymobile going down the stairs...&nbsp; With Brian riding it the whole way down.&nbsp; She had gone running at the first clatter and watched in horror as he experienced his first roller coaster.   As you can imagine, we've decided that the Barneymobile will stay downstairs from now on.&nbsp; Though, if he's anything like me, that won't stop Brian for long.&nbsp; He was the one who carried the Barneymobile up in the first place, after all.

       Joleen mentioned Tuesday night's storm and the destruction of Kate's club house.&nbsp; Here are some pictures of the disaster and the clearing thereof.  The storm toppled a 70 year old maple tree directly onto the ridgepole of Kate's club house. (We know the age of the tree because Saturday, Kate and I had a "homeschooling moment", and counted the growth rings.) Thursday, I borrowed a chain saw from Scott Hall, and Friday I began the process of removing the tree.   Above is a photo of the club house when it was new, three years ago. Below is a photo of it on Friday, after I had cleared away enough limbs to be able to see it. The only thing left standing is Kate's flag pole.   I worked on the clearing all day Friday and Saturday, and for a few hours Sunday afternoon.  Here is a photo of the scene of the disaster when I quit on Sunday.   This shows the firewood that I have cut so far.   And these are the salvaged parts of the club house.   Kate believes that I can incorporate a large portion of the parts in to a new, bigger better club house.  I am sure that she is correct.  We now need to work on the plans.  Of course, I still have the large section of oak tree to remove from the corner of the emu pen.

       Family and friends who are following the Urch's progress against "Dee Bawd Guys" will be as happy as we are to have an APO address:  &nbsp;  Spc. Devereaux Cannon  2/10th MTN  ATTN:&nbsp; A&nbsp;Co., 1-509th IN  APO AE 09303&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We got the address late enough today that we missed the&nbsp;Post Office&nbsp;Saturday hours, but much merriment went into packing the box any way. You can search for shipping requirements/restrictions by entering the zip code, 09303  urlLink here .&nbsp;  &nbsp;  They are at  urlLink Camp Victory North  which is near the Baghdad Airport on what used to be Saddam's hunting preserve.&nbsp; From what I have read over the last 18 months, it is about as comfortable as Iraq gets.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  A word on calling cards (which are an ever popular care package item): get the&nbsp; international kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More care package ideas are  urlLink here .  Sometimes I get inspiration from the items occasionally mentioned on these  urlLink blogs  - and certainly Chief Wiggles's  urlLink Operation Give  is another way to help win the hearts and minds in the Sandbox - it all helps to keep our soldier safe.

       Had run the dishwasher twice, the clothes washer four times, finger painted, hosed off, gave the dog a bath, bathed the two boys, and pancakes were on the make.&nbsp; It was a busy day that only got busier.  &nbsp;  Brian went down for a nap, and since Kate had a friend easier, it was decided that DC and I would be the best grouping to go to town to get an oven coil and make a Wal-mart run.&nbsp; Nice, easy trip that would give DC some quiet time and some Mommy time.&nbsp; A good thing, right?  &nbsp;  Corlew's was easy, even the parallel parking and crossing the street.&nbsp; (There's a karate studio right next to it, will have to drop by at some point when they're open and see if it's feasible for DC.)&nbsp; So, we zipped over to Wal-mart, taking the side street by all the restaurants and clipping a curve, just like I always do.&nbsp; A nice, easy trip?&nbsp;  Right ...  &nbsp;  Despite the fact that I've run over that curb a hundred times before, in both the Focus and the van, this time something bad happened.&nbsp; The right rear tire blew.&nbsp; So, I limped the rest of the way into the parking lot and decided, since I couldn't  see  a tire and lube place there (and it's been awhile, so I couldn't remember if there was one), I decided to change the tire myself.&nbsp; So, I got the first nut off the spare and was working on the second when a very helpful gentleman offered his services.&nbsp; He helped me get the other stubborn bolt off and looked in the back of the van to get the jack.&nbsp; Me, being helpful, told him to use the jack in the box, since Dev had bought it to replace the jack he discovered he didn't like way back during the&nbsp; urlLink Box Incident .&nbsp; The jack, which it turns out, is  not  a jack, but a platform to place SUVs on  after  you jack them up.  &nbsp;  So, we dug out the old, sucky jack and assembled it...&nbsp; Sand apparently doesn't mix well with jacks.&nbsp; It wouldn't budge up or down.&nbsp; So, I have a blown tire and no jack.&nbsp; But, like all good Super Wal-marts, that one does have a tire and lube, so I thanked the nice man for his help, tossed the spare in the back, and limped around the back of the store to to service center...  &nbsp;  To be informed that there were four people in line for tires before me and that it would take 3.5 hours for them to replace my poor tire.&nbsp; Three and a half hours with DC, in Wal-mart.&nbsp;    AAAHHHH!!!     &nbsp;  So, we set off to find a phone, which, of course did nothing but eat my money.&nbsp; So...&nbsp;&nbsp;We trekked to the other entrance and used the phone there to call Nora and tell her that we had a bit of a snafu.&nbsp; The best solution we could come up with was for Nora to wait until Brian woke up to toss the two girls and him in the car so that they could rescue DC.&nbsp; It was a good plan.&nbsp; I liked that plan.&nbsp; Brian couldn't sleep that long, right?&nbsp; This was at about 1 pm.  &nbsp;  DC and I went and bought some gauze pads and "sticky tape" to make a big bandaid for his poor ankle, which is still suffering from fire ant bites.&nbsp; After paying for them, I set off to the McDonald's within the store to get some lunch (Diet, what diet?).&nbsp; DC objected, because we had not yet gotten his promised toy.&nbsp; Turn around, back to the toys.&nbsp; He finally settled on a Transformer that was a bit more expensive than I had planned on allowing, but at that point I figured ten extra dollars was nothing compared to keeping the peace.  &nbsp;  We paid for the Transformer (because Brian could wake up at any time, right?)&nbsp;and settled into Micky D's, where DC had his usual burger and fries.&nbsp; And managed to dump them spectacularly on the floor.&nbsp; I hadn't been there even a half hour and by that point I was sure one of us was going to be in tears.&nbsp; Probably me.  &nbsp;  Replaced the meal, for free even, and we ate, which wasted about half an hour.&nbsp; Also bandaged DC's ankle, which made him quite happy.&nbsp; Next it was get a cart and follow the actual list I had.&nbsp; We spent the next hour or so wandering Wal-mart, comparing hydraulic jacks and the merits of Geotrax track or roadway as a toy for Brian.&nbsp; I decided on both, since that was the same amount of money I spent on DC.&nbsp; Also looked at the digital cameras and talked to one of the photo people about them.&nbsp; Of course, the one I like is the most expensive they have...&nbsp; But I was good, even despite the fact that we have $700+ more in Savings than I thought we had&nbsp;(How in the heck did  that  happen?).&nbsp;&nbsp;  [Addendum  : It's a really good thing I didn't.&nbsp; Just looked at finances again...&nbsp; Looked at the wrong number when figuring out Savings.&nbsp; *thumps head on the desk*&nbsp; I need a nap!]  &nbsp;  Just about the time that DC started to melt, Nora and the rest of the kids arrived to find the van almost done.&nbsp; It had only been 2.5 hours, but that's not something I'll complain about.&nbsp; So, we all walked through the toy section again, and DC scored some kiddie K'nex and Brian a phone.&nbsp; And actual phone, no less, because it was only $5 and the only toy phone they had was one he already owns.  &nbsp;  Oh, also got a new bathroom scale since the old one was left in LA, and is pretty much dead.&nbsp; It says I weigh 170 lbs!&nbsp; The old scale was telling me 180.&nbsp; I checked Brian's weight on it, for accuracy, and it was within 2 pounds of the last time he was at the doctor.&nbsp; So, despite that fact that I have totally fallen off the diet wagon, I have lost weight!&nbsp; Yay me.  &nbsp;  As you can probably expect, I'm exhausted.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  DC has a plan, he informed me, to make his Aunt Kate feel better about the loss of her playhouse.&nbsp; Er...&nbsp; Nora never managed to get that story up, did she?&nbsp; Tuesday night we had a storm.&nbsp; A tornado was spotted in Gallatin, and a perfectly healthy oak tree fell down and smashed Kate's playhouse into kindling.&nbsp; It also possibly squashed her Peace Lily, but we won't know for sure until Papaw cuts up the tree.  &nbsp;  The problem was, the playhouse was one of her presents for her 5th birthday, as was Percy, who had been missing since Sunday (they found her last night).&nbsp; So, Kate was, and is, very upset by the loss.&nbsp; DC's plan is to build her a new playhouse to make her feel better.&nbsp; I'm not sure if he talked to someone to come up with that idea or not.  &nbsp;  And now, we are having melt-down  en mass  and dinner is ready.&nbsp; So, just another day at Rosehill.

       So, now that I've had time to rest and decompress from the trip, I thought I'd write a little about the 13 hour drive from Ft. Polk to Rosehill.  It was actually a rather easy trip.  The boys were happy to watch Power Rangers or play with various books while I toodled along at speeds exceeding the speed limit.    Driving in Louisiana is rather boring.  The area we go through is mostly farm land, so there's not much to look at besides rows of cotton.  There's also the excitement of passing farm equipment...  I misjudged the speed of the tractor and the oncoming vehicle, but proved that the new brakes work well.    Highway 85 in LA is absolutely boring.  I haven't quite decided whether the Department of Transportation is stupid, they think drivers are stupid, or someone's brother makes the signs.  Not only do they have lines on the road to tell you whether or not to pass, but they also have these nice little signs saying "Do Not Pass" and soforth.  It makes me laugh.  Add to that the speed limit through the majority of the trip.  They set the speed at 45 MPH, with is outrageous considering it's all flat farmland.  But, on "dangerous" curves and other warning signs, they warn to slow speed down to 45.  Which, by the way, in LA, if you have to turn the steering wheel, it's a dangerous curve.  In TN, the same curve would be laughed at.  But, I got to Memphis at about 6:30 or so.  Wound up at Lucy but didn't call ahead, so of course the Tickles weren't there.  Once that got straightened out, the boys and I spent the night there, and left rather early on Sunday because the boys were up and wanted to go.  I hate driving in Nashville.  Especially with the construction on I-65.  I tend to stay in the right lane, so I have a nice concrete barrier on the right and 18 wheelers on the left.  Even in the van, I feel like I'm going to turn into a pancake.  (Think thin thoughts.  Think thin thoughts.)  Add to the excitement yesterday, it was raining.  As in "who ordered the monsoon" raining.  So, I had a truck to the left, throwing up water, making it hard to see, combined with the small river of rainwater on the right being thrown up by own wheels hitting the windshield, and gray-out conditions.  It was less than fun.  Got to Rosehill at around 11:40.  And, of course, the Cannons weren't home, either.  But, it was OK because I have a key.  They got home to find boys waiting for hugs and kisses, and Kate was thrilled.  The boys are having a blast.  There's so much to see and do here.  Brian adores the kittens, who are just big enough for him to wrap his hands around their ribs (though I do feel sorry for the one who was carried around by one little handful of tummy skin).  He has been a bit clingy, but that will ease off once he figures out that we'll stay here for awhile.  As it is, , he hardly lets me out of his sight.  Anyway, that's all for today.  I hope everyone out there is doing well.

          OK, Urch, here is some information on our land in Mississippi.  The map, below, give you some perspective on the general location.   Our land is location just below the word "Marina" in Eastport Marina on the map.  To see a good arial photo of the land (with boundary lines drawn on it) go to  urlLink this link .  I believe that photo was made about 1996.  The total land area is about 115 acres.

       I'm off to Rosehill tomorrow.  The plan is to leave at around 10 am, drive until maybe 5 or so, depending on how I feel and how the kids are doing, before stopping at a motel.  That should place me a couple of hours on this side of Memphis.  We'll finish the drive on Sunday, to get there in the afternoon or evening.  Just a nice, easy trip.  Of course, now it's 4:40 am and I can't sleep.  My mind is whirling around with thoughts on what I still need to do.  I've mentally packed the van about five times now, and I'm not particularly happy about it.  But, what can you do?  It was either get up or wake Brian with my tossing and turning.  So, I'm up.

            509th Soldiers Training to Fight for Freedom  Soldiers from the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 509th Infantry Regiment, stand in the desert of Kuwait as they prepare for a day of training. The unit is attached to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division. 1/509th Soldiers will train with 2nd BCT before moving into Iraq. A and B Companies deployed to support Operation Iraqi Freedom in June. Geronimo Soldiers have, since 1993, served as the Joint Readiness Training Center’s opposing force for rotations. Although the unit’s primary mission has been training the remainder of the force, leaders say Soldiers have always been combat ready.     By Pfc. BRIAN SCHROEDER 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division Published 2 July 2004 in  The Guardian , Fort Polk, Louisiana  Members of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 509th Infantry Regiment, were not recognizable Soldiers. Their mission was to grow long hair and beards to disguise themselves as the opposing force at the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk. But like every Soldier, that mission can change at the drop of a hat.  After receiving the call to fight the war on terrorism, they were spun round the barber’s chair and transformed from combat trainers to training themselves for combat in Iraq.  The 1/509th is attached to the 10th Mountain Division’s 2nd Brigade Combat Team to combat the Global War on Terrorism. Capt. Jerord Wilson, A Company commander, said this is the first deployment the 509th has seen since World War II.  “We do a different type of training than what conventional forces do,” Wilson said. “Even though we train units to go into combat, we also train and are always mission ready.”  While at Fort Polk, Soldiers from the 509th participate in each of the approximate two week rotations at the JRTC as the opposition force for rotational training units.  “The 1st of the 509th represents the enemy force a unit is going to face when they go into a combat theater,” Wilson said. “When a unit comes into JRTC,  they ask for certain training perimeters or objectives they would like to meet. Based on those training objectives we present them with an enemy.”  Wilson said some of the training the 509th receives is learning from the mistakes made by units they are opposing during JRTC rotations.  “We get to see lots of units during the rotations we have each year,” Wilson said. “During the rotations there is constant teaching, coaching and mentoring that is given by the observer-controllers to the units that are training as well as the opposition force to make sure units learn as they go.”  Part of the training the 509th participates in is located at the military operations in urban terrain site at Fort Polk. The MOUT site is a replicated village for Soldiers to train and familiarize themselves in combat environments in an urban environment.  “The MOUT site is like going into the jungle,” Wilson said. “You don’t know where the enemy is. He could be around any corner and you have to prepare for it. We live and breathe in the urban sprawl and are well trained in that environment.”  The 509th also offers something other conventional units are unable to offer –– airborne capabilities, Wilson said.  “Ninety-five percent of the unit is airborne trained,” Wilson said. “The 509th was the first airborne unit. Many Soldiers don’t know that the airborne patch was designed by Lt. Gen. William Yarborough, an original member of the 1st of the 509th.” The infantry airborne regiment brandishing the 509th Geronimo patch on their left breast pocket has always been ready for the call to deploy, said Wilson.  “We have seen the transition of what happened after 9-11 and expected that sooner or later we would be called on,” Wilson said. “We have always been prepared for this day. We have come a long way in a short period of time in preparing ourselves for this fight.”

        ... and it's from CSM Richard Beal!  He proves himself to be a very perceptive guy in this part:      I know your son well.  He's a good soldier and I am happy to have him in  my unit.  A very personable fellow; seems to get along with most of the boys very well.  I've always been able to count on SPC Cannon to do what is right.  He has a good platoon and a good platoon sergeant as well - SFC Rasberry will take good care of him.  The commander and first sergeant, CPT Wilson and 1SG Haga are top-notch leaders who have only the best interest of the soldiers in mind.  CPT Wilson is a meticulous planner - always an eye for extreme details and 1SG Haga is a soldier's- a soldier who takes care of his boys.  All in all, your son is in good hands.   Thank you again, not only for your concern and trust in our unit, but for raising a son the quality of Devereaux.  God bless America.    I had to clean up formatting a bit in moving the CSM's e-mail to the blog, but don't think I added any typo's, LOL.  Thank you CSM Beal.  You made a mom's day!

       Got a call from Dev this morning.  He's doing well.  Tired of "wasting time" in Kuwait.  He wants to get into Iraq and get it over with.  Apparently, everyone has said that the 509th has been either the best or next to at going through each of the ranges.  Today they did a range where they had to jump out of the back of a Bradley and shoot.  They had never did it before, and got it right on the first try.  They were supposed to do the range yesterday, but the other platoons there kept messing up and having to redo it.  He got a special dinner for the 4th.  Bar-b-qued ribs, corn on the cobb, and "near beer."  Which, according to him is non-alcoholic Milwalkee's Best.  He said it wasn't too bad, and he got an icecream cone, so everything worked out.  Apparently one of the platoon wives visited this Rosehill Academy while searching for info on Camp Udairi and the 509th.  Which we both thought was kinda cool.  Brian has decided he doesn't want to see 2, despite the fact that his birthday is tomorrow.  In the last two weeks, he's broken eggs on the couch and floor, poured syrup on the couch, and today he poured about half a gallon of milk on the floor.  This doesn't include the normal spills of ketchup, water, and anything else he can get his hands on.  Seriously, the Little Green steamer has saved his hide.  Especially with the eggs.

         After multiple assertions that Brian had gotten swords, every one wanted to see what was really in the box, so that was the first present opened.    He was proud of his vindication - stainless steel BBQ skewers are a great deal like swords.     DC did get everything for his Mommy - everything that was peony scented in the bath shop.  He earnestly wanted to like the green apple scent, because green is his favorite color.  Finally he settled down to trying to decide between vanilla and peony.  It took quite a while and a good deal of patience from the clerk, but once he decided, he was quite pleased with himself.    Angel 2 arrived in good order to the relief of all.  I doubt if Jo has had a chance to even get it out of the box yet, but she is definitely looking forward to doing so.    A reproduction of Pete Wickstrom's Air Force jacket was a hit with the boys as well as Jo.

          Kate decorated the cake, which is only fitting given that Jo had taught her how to make rosette flowers.    There was much joyful anticipation.    We opted for the full 27 candles    Which made quite a glow.    Brian approved of the cake effort.

       The boys have each gotten their "mission with Mamaw" trips.  DC has done very well, confining himself to "I got you EVERYTHING, Mommy!"  He got to go last week and wrapped on Saturday.  Brian was thrilled with his gift selection.  Because he doesn't know the adult term, his secret is safe, unless Jo knows more sign language than I think.  It is a classic for him to give her, but he has altogether different name and gesture set for it.   Urch's order was fulfilled and should arrive today.  Papaw's little surprise is in good shape.  I am quite pleased with what Kate and I did, although that particular phone effort went a litle awry, which meant that Brian and I spent about an hour in a  far  too Brian interesting place while the order was "fixed."  Tomorrow we bake - and add lots of buttercream icing.    Saturday is the first August B-day (Joleen), then Tuesday is Kate's, then the 27th is the Urch's. He has a good selection too - we hope it arrives in good order.

       We have a new interjection.  Instead of "Hmmm" or "I see" or "How funny", it saves time to just cut right to the chase: "Have you got Brian?"    Chase is the right term.  From a distance of 15 feet or more, Brian thinks an adult voice saying "Brian!" is adult speak for "Ready, set, go!"  He complies with his translation.  Of course, an adult voice saying "Brian!" from a distance of 2 feet is adult speak for "Come rub your icy pop in my hair."  He just as readily complies with that translation.  Yesterday Jo took DC, Kate, and a friend to Wal-Mart to get birthday presents for a 5 yo friend's birthday party.  Brian stayed home with Mamaw and Papaw. After a 30 second meltdown, he was delighted with the arrangement.  I was delighted when Papaw said he had plans for the boy-chik.  I took full advantage by sitting down at the computer to order some things for other upcoming birthdays, so my direct knowledge is limited to hearing a knock on the closed door between down and up stairs.  I answered that knock to find Brian grinning a me, holding a carton of cherries.  He couldn't open the door one handed and wouldn't put down the cherries.  I got him out some cherries in a bowl, went down to close the fridge (he usually tries to close it, but has variable success), then went back outside with him to Papaw.  Papaw was installing the Army Mom license plate on the Saturn.  Brian had been enchanted by starting the Galant to let it run a few minutes, by checking the donut on the Galant to see if it was compatible with the Saturn, and by getting Papaw's tool box out.  He got bored though and left when Papaw started unscrewing the plate holder.  Left as far as the lower patio before Papaw realized Brian hadn't responded to the last question.  Engaging a 2 in a conversation is usually as good as a leash for keeping tabs on where they are.  The problem is that Brian only needs about 10 seconds to teleport to danger.  Papaw spotted Brian, who was heading down the driveway past the chicken house; Papaw quite reasonably yelled "Brian!"  Brian, capably translating the adult speak with due regard for the distance, took off running.  Papaw repeated the mistake, before he saw Percy.  He called Percy, who understands that an adult voice calling her name from more than 15 feet away, if and only if she is within 10 feet of Brian, should be translated "Can you get Brian?"  Percy herded Brian back up to the top of the hill to everyone's delight.  Installation of the license plate continued for some moments, until Brian decided that the socket wrench Papaw had been using and had placed on the ground next to him was (1) cool, (2) probably forbidden to 2 yo's, and (3) best explored in its possibilities by taking it away to somewhere he wouldn't be interrupted.  He was correct in every point and pretty much successful.   Papaw heard the back door open.  He got up off the ground and went to see what Brian was up to.  Papaw moves like and adult, at least when starting from the supine position on the ground; Brian moves like only Brian can.  By the time Papaw crossed the patio to the den, Brian was indeed exploring the joys of the socket wrench, in disturbing proximity to the TV.  Papaw retrieved the socket wrench, assured Brian that the incipient temper tantrum would be a waste of energy and went back out to the car.  He left Brian in the den, which I didn't realize.  He figured Brian would be right behind him; usually Brian would have been.  However, Brian remembered buying cherries last week.  He went into stealth mode, left the den, came through the dining room, opened the stair door (right next to the computer room where I was placing orders), closed it silently to prevent detection, and got himself the cherries from the downstairs fridge.   Then I heard the knock and opened the door for Brian and his prize.  After tending to the cherries, I herded him back out towards Papaw, intending to mention that being reponsible for a 2 meant knowing where he was until you passed him off (a gentle, loving mention but firm, given that Kate is still mourning a few things that have been Brianized).  Papaw was headed back inside, having waited for Brian a minute or two and deciding that he wasn't coming back outside.    Now Einstein's clearest explanation of relativity was a comparison of a minute sitting on a hot stove as opposed to a minute of kissing a beautiful girl.  Therefore, I will not make any guesses as to whether Brian was inside without my knowing it for less than a minute or for more.  However, I know Papaw well enough to know Brian wasn't inside long enough to commit the cherry caper without warping the time/space continuum.    I haven't heard Brian's chatter in about 15 seconds (he was talking to the ants on The Magic Schoolbus episode).  Have you got Brian?
