      I gotta tell you this before I collapse in a heap in my bed. Tonight was the first showcase I've hosted. The two bands that played were both fabulous. Cougar  Bob played first and they played a blinding set. Only forty minutes but God! were they good. Then We had John Dalton and Martin Gregory.  It was better than I had ever dreamt. You know I felt so useless tonight. I'd spent weeks organising this event but on the night I had nothing to do. I had hired Tony to supply the sound system and do the sound engineering. So all I could do was say hello. And "well done".  All my work was already done and all I could do was sit back and watch it unfold. There was nothing more I could do. I was furious today. I picked up the local paper and looked at the events calendar and there was nothing about my night. I phoned the paper. What's happening? I asked. I sent two E-mails and spoke to two different people and still nothing was published. They apologised profusely. But that doesn't get the crowds in. I was so angry I was shaking. Sandra phoned me and I let of a tirade of abuse. Not at her, but at the fuck wits who are supposed to be doing a job, but don't do it. She told me to calm down but I was so angry. It's a good job Sandra is one of my best friends, because she took a whole lot of shit from me this afternoon. I spent weeks organising this. I do everything myself because then I know it's gonna be done. Once I rely on someone else it all fucks up. It's the age old adage, if you want something doing properly, you do it yourself. There is a school of thought that a good manager is able to delegate responsibilty to others. Well I tried that and look what happened. Fuck all. But despite those fuck wits at the Evening Telegraph the evening went well. I gotta sleep. Tomorrow it's me up on stage with Sandra and Simon. God help us.

      You know that buzzy feeling you get in your head when you are doing loads of stuff non stop. Well that’s what I’ve got tonight. Life is non stop and I have to keep going. It turns out my daughter is just the same, she can’t rest, she has to be doing something all the times even when she’s so tired that any normal person would sleep. I guess we’re not normal. Both of us must be hyperactive or something. Or driven by some unseen force.  Today I worked all day and at 5:30 shut the shop and high  tailed it to Sandra’s. She was waiting on the pavement outside her house for me. WE drove to Simons for our last rehearsal before Saturdays gig. Simon had dinner waiting for us. Pizza chips and curry. Hmmm! You wouldn’t believe what he has in his kitchen. A pin ball machine. Then he spent a while showing us his guitar in this book called “The guitars of John Entwhistle”. He has a guitar that was owned by John Entwhistle. And to make it even more special it was owned before that by Pete Townsend. So Sandra and I have both played the same guitar as both John and Pete. Incredible. People would pay for that honour. He even has the paperwork to prove it’s the real thang. So we played for nearly two and a half hours. I know you aint gonna be there so here’s some of the songs we’ll be playing.  Wicked game – Chris Isacks (Me guitar, simon guitar/ vocals, Sandra vocals) Aint  no sunshine – Bill Withers  (Me on guitar, Sandra vocals and Simon bongos) Free bird – Lynerd Skynerd  (Me guitar/vocals, Simon guitar, Sandra mandolin) Wild world – Cat Stevens (me guitar/vocals, Simon Mandolin, Sandra guitar) Handbags and gladrags- Stereophonics (Simon guitar/vocal, me guitar, Sandra Mandolin) Suspicious minds –Elvis Is she really going out with him- Joe Jackson Dreams – Fleetwood mac  Oh there’s a load more and I’m bored listing them. You’ll just have to imagine them for now. So we finished the rehearsal and I went to pick up my children. Dropped off Sandra because she was tired and we went to Geneva’s to see Abi and her band “Within”.  I’ve told you before how incredible Abi is. Well Jamie, my boy, was watching and he nudged me and said “You know you said that she had stage presence?” “Yes.” “Well she’s got a lot hasn’t she?” “She’s got it in spades. You can’t keep your eyes off her can you?” “No. She’s fabulous.” As a tease I suggested that he had fallen in love with her. At first sight. He said he hadn’t. I looked around the pub and saw the band list for the coming month and there was my band on the 24th June. “Ad Hock” that is, not my new band “Mike da hat and friends”. It could get complicated when our gigs clash, but then I know Del and Tony can do without me in Ad Hock. They’re professional.  “Within” played their first set of three and we had to leave because the kids have school tomorrow. We said our goodbyes and Abi gave my children big hugs. Gemma is used to being with musicians and didn’t bother much. But I guess Jamie was really pleased that he got a hug from Abi. You know I wish you could all meet Abi. Your lives would be so much better for it. http://www.within-band.co.uk  It’s my first showcase event tomorrow night. I am not playing tomorrow night. But I have two new bands playing. I am more nervous for them than I am for myself on our first gig Saturday. I know we’re good. I know we can play what people want to hear. But the showcase is my baby. And the new bands have to come through for me. I just want them to take it as seriously as I do. I’ve worked hard for this. On their behalf. I’m putting my reputation on the line here. It could all fall apart if they are crap. But I console myself that when I was in their position I would have been practicing like mad. I still do. So I hope they have been rehearsing so they can be as good as they can possibly be. It’s in their own interest if they want to get on in the music biz. I hope they don’t let me down. All I ask is they take it seriously and do their best. It’s something I have no control over I guess that’s what’s making me nervous. I’d better sleep before I go crazy with worry.

      We’re cracking on apace. Only two more days before the first gig of my new band “Mike Da Hat and friends”.  Some wag commented, “That’s rich! You’ve actually got friends?” Tonight we rehearsed at Sandra’s until she called it a day before the crazy old woman downstairs threw a wobbler and started hitting the ceiling with her walking stick. We tried to tone it down a tad, but, when you’re getting into one, it’s hard not to just go for it. Especially when we’re practicing the thrash bit of Free bird.  Thump thump thump.  Shit!  Sandra is in trouble at work. And it’s all my fault. I don’t normally swear much in real life but in my writing I call it like it is. If someone swears like a trooper I will write it just as they say it. So she was at work and in a spare moment thought she’d have a snoop at my blog.  The automated webmaster, der fuehrer  of the internet, interceded With a message about obscene language, and came up with a warning. It reminded me of that film starring Sly Stallone and Sandra Bullock where he is automatically fined for every incident of swearing. An automatic written warning will arrive on her desk in two days time. Scary huh? I suppose it’s to stop the workers downloading pornography and pictures of naked children in provocative poses onto the firms mainframe. But my blog?  I’m not sure whether to be chuffed to bits that my material is dangerous enough, controversial enough, to contravene the public decency laws or disgusted that I am being tarred with the same brush  as pornographers.  I have a new toy. It’s my new computer that Danny built me for very little money. OK nothing special about a new PC but this one has a huge 120gb hard drive filled up with a library of 12,000 songs, all CD quality. He’s even stuck in a DVD writer so I can create my own CD’s for the car when I’m cruising. According to the PC if I started playing all the songs today it would still have a few more days of playing to go a month from today. Incredible. That’s approximately just over 800 hours of music. So now I have a PC/ jukebox in my flat.  Think of a song, type it in, by either Artist or title, and push the button, up it comes. I’m listening to a selection of the Rolling Stones right now on continuous play. Fool to cry. Someone said the other day “What do you want 12,000 songs for?” Well I don’t really, but as a musician it’s a reference library. For instance tonight we decided that we were going to put Chris Isacks “Wicked game” into the set. I thought I’d have a listen. Typed it in and up it came. Bill Withers “Aint no sunshine” just the same. It’s so useful and convenient. Before I used to have to go round all my friends and ask them if they had a copy of a song so I could listen to it. Get off of my cloud.  ON my old computer I could burn a CD in about forty minutes. This new one will do a 70 minute CD in 6 minutes flat. And with blanks at 10p each……. I rest my case.  I got a phone call from a friend of mine this morning, it was Frederic Becognau,  a film camera man for Canal 5 in France. Gimme shelter. His son is in England at the moment and could I check up on him? Sure, no problem, except he’s in Exeter and that’s gotta be three hours away. So he’s invited me to his wedding. He’s marrying a good friend of mine a French Artist from Brittany. I wonder if he needs a band for his wedding reception. Two years ago I was going to blow this gaff and go and live in France. But the shit hit the fan and it all fell through. I’d even got a job as a manager of an Art gallery. Such a shame, chances like that don’t happen every day. But that’s another story. Satisfaction.  On one of my regular trips to France a few years ago we went to support a friend of ours at a gig in Carhaix, Brittany. We were guests of honour and given a slap up feast, then my friends went on stage to play their set. I stood in the Audience watching when patric announced an interval he came of stage for a beer and we stood talking. He said “Mikel you’re on next.” ”What I haven’t brought my guitar.” Honky tonk women. “No problem. I ‘ave brought you one from Paris.” “But I don’t know what to play.” “You play anything. My band is a good band they play anything.” So he dragged me up on stage. I was really nervous. 400 in the crowd. What do I play? I remembered “Back to the future”.  “OK Boys a blues riff in E. Just follow me for the lead breaks.” I went into one. Jesus H Christ! The crowd went wild. We played and played. One by one his band got tired and walked off stage leaving just patric and me. Eventually at three in the morning the manager said “Ca suffit!” That’s enough we want to go home now.  We came off stage. All these young girls came running up to me asking for my autograph. They were screaming “Anglais Anglais” All I could think off was “I’m just a bleedin’ shop keeper I ain’t nothing special.” I signed a few autographs just to keep them happy. Bloody hell! They thought I was famous. Poor disillusioned fools. If only they knew the truth. Because I used to love her but it’s all over now. I had loads of Adventures in France. One day we were on the beach, my artist friend was sitting next to me stark naked and her friend the same. My Artist was painting a beach scene and no one took any notice. I sat there real cool like in my clothes because Martine (my artiste) had told me “Mikel you are so white you should not take off your vetements. Wait until le soleil is low.”  So I sat there next to two very cute naked French girls scanning the horizon. When my eyes lit upon this one girl in the middle of the beach wrapped in a beach towel trying to get changed. Let’s spend the night together. I noticed that every male eye was on her. Strange, because there was loads of naked women on the beach. But this one girl was wrapped in a towel. I must have felt what every other man felt that day. Please God make that towel slip. Christ I was sitting right next to two beautiful naked women, but this one girl struggling under a towel had everyones attention.  It made me realise that if a girl wants attention she doesn’t have to be naked. She has to make the guys want her naked and tease them.  If she had stripped off on the beach no one would have even taken a second glance, but because she was trying to hide herself, everyone was eyes front. On stalks. I could tell you stories all night but I guess I’d better sleep now. Little red rooster. And so it goes.  May your God be with you Rock on dudes  Mikel

      A few years ago I had occasion to have to deliver an Electric cooker to a pensioner. Install it and take away the old one. No problem. Except the cooker was sealed into the work top. I tugged and tugged at it but it wouldn't budge. Eventually i got a flat bladed screwdriver and started chiselling away at the seal which turned out to be thirty years of dirt grease and filth. After ten minutes of chiselling. I gave the cooker another big tug. There was a huge crack and the cooker flew forward, the over door fell open and a tray of blue green granules fell out onto my shoes.  "What's that?" I asked the old man, who was standing there, still in his Jim Jams with his tool hanging out the front opening. The cleaning lady and daily help fussed round him. "Now the Mr ****** you just let that young man get on with his work. And don't be letting that little man of yours escape." and she rearranged his pyjama bottoms. He wouldn't be turned though, and he looked at me dead straight and said "It's rat poison." "What? you've got trouble with rats?" "Not anymore boy." and then he turned and allowed the daily to usher him to his chair in front of the TV. He sat down. Settled himself and looked over his shoulder at me. "Them were big buggers too. The size of cats." "Really?" I said, humouring him, from behind the cooker. "When I were young we'd blast the buggers with a shotgun. Chase them round the barns an blast 'em. There wouldn't be much left for the cats after that. Bloody useless cats anyway, they were all too damn scared of the buggers. Silly devils would run away." I finished installing the new cooker and turned to the old man "There you go you can cook whatever you want now." "There'll be no cooking done on that bugger, I get meals on wheels boy, meals on wheels." "So what did you want a cooker for then?" "I don't want a cooker. It's bloody free isn't it? If them thar government wallers are daft enough to buy me a new cooker I'm gonna let 'em. Bloody social workers coming round telling me my cookers aint safe. Bloody do gooders wanna give me a nice new safe cooker, well let 'em tha's what I say let 'em and hang the lot of 'em. I got me meals on wheels and my TV. I got all I need. I don't need no bloody social worker. So if they wanna do that, it's their money, what do I care? I'll be dead afore long any road." "Well I'll be seeing you then." I said cheerfully, picking up my tool box. "I'll be dead before I bloody see you again boy. Hey and don't forget to put that rat poison back in the new oven. Bloody Rats........"

      Just been watching some workers digging up the pavement. They spent an hour shovelling the broken tarmac onto the back of their lorry. Then the driver decided that he wanted to redistribute the load because it was all at the front. So he got into the cab and started raising the tipper. Well the load was redistributed all right. Straight back onto the road. Oh golly! How they laughed. This is the British workforce at it's finest.  Earlier a scruffy chap came into the shop. Nothing unusual about that, except he was carrying a cup of coffee, which he placed on the counter. "Got any kettles?" he asked.  "We've got a few." "Give me one." "Which one?" "The first you come to.Any." I gave him a kettle. He paid, picked up his coffee, took a mouthful, and walked out muttering something.

      Just heard on the Radio, and I admit that this will be old news to some, but it needs repeating. The police, in this country, when they find any asylum seekers, are more likely to hand over the address of the nearest home office building so they can hand themselves in. What's all that about? Then last week the police arrested three illegals for trying to LEAVE the country. It beggars belief. If they want to leave, let them. Why waste money arresting an illegal immigrant when he/she wants to go home?   Then earlier, and this is a totally different subject, I was listening to a few minutes of Radio 2. This woman had written in to request a song REM's "Losing my religion" The DJ read out the request and announced that he was sorry but that particular song was not on todays playlist so "how about this one?" and he proceeded to play some absolute rubbish tune. Very shortly after that there was the jingle announcing how they are playing the music we want to hear. Hello? We try to tell them what we want to hear and they still insist on playing what the record companies want us to hear.  Hmmm call me cynical if you like.  Better do some more work I suppose.

      Life gets more interesting. Friday I went to see Steve the landlord of the Wheatsheaf, to give him the definitive list of all the acts we’re putting on over next weekend. It’s a bit of a showcase for new talent, and it made me think, perhaps we can do this regularly give new talent a chance to get some public exposure, some live playing experience. I put it to him that we could do this on a regular basis. Maybe once a month. Well it was all agreed on a handshake, except he wants it every three weeks. I put the word out on the street immediately. I’ve already got one E-mail from a band who wants to play. So that’s encouraging.  So now the hard work starts. Actually I’ve already covered a lot of ground. I’ve spoken to the local newspaper and got them on board.  Also I’ve got the Peterborough Live Music centre enthusiastic. Hmmm in amongst all that talent out there we might find someone who really shines. That would be great. Spoke to Simon my partner in this project. He was initially worried that we were going to get paid for effectively doing nothing.  I explained to him that we were doing far from nothing. I was doing all the organisation the planning the bookings the liaison with newspapers etc and he was doing the sound engineering on the night. Making sure that each band sound as good as we can possibly make them sound.   Saturday was Del’s wedding. Beautiful day. Except for his father. Del’s parents are known as the Whiteadders.  That being a reference to the “Blackadder” series, where the Whiteadders were strict puritans who never smiled, never drank, smoked or did anything vaguely enjoyable. MR Whiteadder came to me during the “standing-about–in-the-church-yard” bit.  “I think I’ve upset Del.” he said.  “Last night I mentioned that he was a BIG fat pig. I  don’t think he liked that.” No shit Sherlock! I thought Later Del and Di were having their pictures taken beneath a beautiful tree full of brilliant purple blooms. Whiteadder turned to me and said “That will be the last year that that tree will bloom, after they’ve been under it.” I couldn’t believe the vitriol coming from this guys mouth.  Del   is one of the guitarists in our band, we all love him to death. On stage he sparkles with energy and humour, and even when he’s falling over drunk, he can still play like he wuz a fucking demon. So it was a bit galling to have to listen to his father continuously making snide and cutting remarks about him and his bride. We were under strict instructions not to rock the boat and ignore the remarks.  Last night (Sunday) we went to see Leons final gig in this country before they go on tour of America (adamleon.com). There was a guy came in wearing a baseball cap. He was already pissed and started dancing all by himself. He had a very strange way of dancing. I decided he’d been taught to dance by Boris Karloff.  Paul came to the shop today. We have a joke, he has the same surname as me so we’re brothers,  which is great, except he’s black and I aint. I say “do you think they’ll guess we’re not really brothers?”  He asked how the music was going. I said “Pretty good. Why do ya wanna sing some?” And Paul went into an impromptu rendition of “Aint no sunshine”. I was impressed. He’s got a great voice. Very soulful which is lucky because he loves all that soul music. Stuff I don’t normally play. “Can I get you to sing at my Showcase night?” “I’m working.” “I’ll get you a backing band, you can do a couple of numbers. Join in on the Mike Da hat and friends nights.” “yeah ok brother.”

      Tonight Sandra and I took my children Gemma and Jamie to party for the launch of a new CD. Friends of ours have a band “Leon”. It was pretty special because my daughter Gemma filmed it. She’s going to do film at Lincoln University. So she was commissioned to make the video for MTV. She’s only 18. Unfortunately we had disaster upon disaster while trying to edit the film and eventually it was taken from her hands and redone by a professional outfit in London. They used her ideas and story board and made a video which was far short of what she had planned. That’s not to say it wasn’t good but it wasn’t what she wanted. Never mind her stuff is on the DVD that’s for sale and she is credited in the titles. Actually so am I. Shit I’m gonna be famous.  Every one was there. The hangers on. The fans. The family. The curious. The boys did an interview on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire the other day, I heard it. The interviewer was useless. He asked them three times “So lads when do you fly out to America?” making them answer the same question three times and try to make it still interesting. Where do the BBC get these idiots from? Well I took my Children home. Gemma was so high with excitement. We left Sandra with her beloved.  I mentioned yesterday that I have been blogging for over twenty years and didn’t realise it. Well in the early days I used to write about stuff that happened to me.but then I started thinking I need to write about more interesting stuff and the only way to do that was to do more interesting stuff. So with that in mind I started Scuba diving just so I could write about it. And Gliding. And travelling. After a while I got so busy doing all this stuff I was getting worried that I hadn’t got time to write about it. So it was a sort of trade off. I’d have to do something. Maybe I didn’t really want to, maybe I was even scared to do it, but it had to be done for the sake of my journal. Because that was what it was in them days, not a blog. So I forced myself to do more and more exciting stuff so I could keep my readers entertained. If I was going to write about my life it had to be a life worth writing about. Well now I’ve got this life by default. It’s not my choosing. The writing has forced me into it. And now I have an exciting life. And  I don’t really have time to write. I play in a band, in fact two bands. I travel, I organise events, I do stuff I never dreamt I would. And it’s all your fault because you want to read this shit. Or is it because I want to write this shit? Whose life is this anyway? Yours or mine. Denise said to me today “you seem much happier now.”  “Yes, I guess so.” “Is it because you’ve started writing again?” Shit! What a question. Am I that shallow that my life depends on whether I write or not? It’s something I agonise over. I want to live my life the way I want to. I want to be in control. But it seems the writing has taken over. When I stopped writing I got depressed. Now I’m writing again life has got better but at a cost. I have to stay up late to do what I have to do. It’s like an addiction you have no control over. A friend of mine told me tonight that it’s becoming a struggle to keep up the writing. All I can say is there are no rules or regulations. You write when you have to. I read in a blog sometime recently that a true blogger writes religiously every day. It’s a prerequisite to be able to call yourself a blogger. No, that’s not true. I’d rather read quality stuff occasionally than crap every day. Every one is different. Just like some people make love once a month and are happy, others once a week, others three times a day. Whatever lights your candle. Whatever works for you.  Well I’m all blogged out now. Gotta sleep.  Keep the faith  Mikel

      Went to see Sandra tonight. God! She looked like shit. Eyes red and streaming, lost her voice, but bless her, she was still practicing her guitar. Trying to put a brave face on the fact her beloved is going on tour of America next week and she wont see him for two months.  And when he does get back he's almost immediatley off on tour of Scotland for six weeks. Hey that's what happens when you fall in love with a professional musician. The music comes first. You are young grass hopper, you will learn. We didn't play tonight. But I went to the club all the same. It was the same old crowd. Howard with the impossibly deep voice. Andy who is so bad he is brilliant. He is the only person I know who can play "Baby hit me one more time" on a fender stratocaster and and play it for laughs. Absolutely brilliant. And John Quinn. What can I say? This boy has talent. I spent three weeks learning to play "Substitute" by "The Who" we were playing on the same bill and he played it first. I was mortified. he played it a million times better than I ever could. So it was dropped from the set immediately. Don't you just hate that? I'm happy to follow anyone on stage......except John. The bastard how come he has ALL the talent? Why do I have to work so hard just to be competent, when he just does it so easily? I could easily learn to hate him. But then hate isn't in my vocabulary. I had a great idea today. Simon and I can do showcase events using our PA system. We invite up and coming wannabees to do a gig, a proper gig at a pub. We get maybe three or four bands and they just plug into our PA. They do a thirty minute set each. They'll be gagging for the opportunity to play live in front of a crowd. To prove themselves and to have the honour of telling all their mates that they have a proper gig to do. They'll even pay us to play. Then we charge the pub £150 for the privelige of us putting on the show. We win all ways. Sounds great doesn't it? Now tell me the drawbacks that I haven't thought of. Yes I know the drums will be a problem. I've fielded the idea to a few other musician friends of mine and they all seem to think it's a good idea, so maybe it can work. Jeez I can be so altruistic sometimes. Helping out the up and comings and lining my pockets at the same time. And help Simon pay for his J200. A worthy charity. We were going to go on a road trip to this place in Bath to buy the J200. But he thought it was too dangerous. he'd want to buy everything in the shop and make his credit card go into overdrive. He's a sucker for a classic guitar. Me? I'm happy with my 12 string and my 6 string and my mandolin. What more do I want? OK maybe an adoring crowd, all screaming and shouting for more. Shit! I'm just a music junkie.  Someone who'd rather be up there on stage, than in the crowd screaming for more.  I'd write more but I know I must sleep. That's the problem with being a writer. It's in your blood. It's the very essence of your soul. When you don't write you feel uncomfortable. Uneasy. I didn't know I was a blogger until a few weeks ago. I've been doing this for over twenty years. Writing regular letters and Emailing them to a select group of friends. I'm not sure I like to be a blogger, just as I'm not sure I like to be human, or like to be alive, but that's how it is. This is what I am I have to accept that. Perhaps it's the name that puts me off. Being a blogger. Sounds shite doesn't it? Sound like I'm an anorak. But I'll deal with it.  I've scrolled through the blogs posted on just this site and they go past at an everage of three every second. I try and read as many as I can stand. Most of them are absolute dross. But occassionally I come across a gem like "The hackney lookout". It's not often. It gives me hope. In amongst all the rubbish is some talent. It just takes some finding. But in the end worth it. If you are reading this Quink tell me how to make a link to your blog. It's got  to be shared.   May your God be with you  Rock on  Mikel

      I had to deliver light bulbs to my local pub the other day. It's a strange feeling to go into your local in the middle of the day. It doesn't smell the same.  There's a hoover in the middle of the floor and Mandy, the bar maid, is wandering around with a duster and pledge, polishing the tables. A couple of early birds are sitting at the bar with pints of beer. Smoking. The blue smoke curls and twists in the air around them.  You don't notice that at night. The sun sends shafts of light through the window diagonally. The place smells of disinfectant and furniture polish. Steve the landlord is sitting, hunched over a  newspaper, his hair dishevelled, a cup of coffee steaming in front of him. He looks like shit. "Morning Mike." he says, hardly looking up. "Morning Steve." But he's too engrossed trying the read the back page headlines of the Sun. "Fucking West Ham won last night" he says "They played a blinder." I think "so fucking what?" but say "Really? They're doing well." "They need to only scored five points in the last three games." As if I'm in the least bit interested. But I carry on "so who they playing next?"  He tells me. It goes in one ear and out the other. I don't care. He looks up and calls to Mandy. "Sort out Mikels bill will you." Mandy comes over and takes the invoice from my hand, inspects it, as if it's  her business how much it's for, shrugs and wanders behind the bar to get the money. It isn't. She just shells out the cash.  "you in tonight?" she says "Maybe."  Eleven o'clock in the morning who gives a shit? I trouser the cash and look into the other bar to see if I know anyone. Then into the conservatory where we meet for our music club. There's a group of women sitting in there chatting over coffee and plastic bags full of embroidery. Some are just sitting picking away at their work, others standing holding up their latest creations. It's all very quiet. Steve still looks like shit. He's been on the piss with his Speedway chums the night before. He's only been into Speedway for eight months but already he fancies he knows everyone and everything. he spouts on interminably about his dream team. telling anyone who hasn't the heart to tell him to "fuck off" all  about his latest passion. Two years ago it was football, last year rugby,  this year it's speedway, and  next year it'll be something else. But he will always be an authority on the subject I suspect he has Aspergers syndrome.  Regulars walk in. I don't know them because they're not regulars when I am. I can't be doing with this day time drinking mularky. "You stopping for a drink Mike?" "NO I never drink before nine." I say. "But it's eleven now." "I gotta work. I'll see you later."

      It's less than two weeks before the first gig of my new band. We've been rehearsing like mad. My old band Ad Hock never rehearsed. We never rehearse on principle. From the very first day I joined that band I was expected to just get on stage and play. It didn't matter that they never told me what song we were playing next or what key we were going to be playing it in. I had a matter of milliseconds to work it out, then catch up. But it was a lot of fun. last year we had been to the beer festival and Del and I were totally plastered. We were in the beer garden of our local and Del got the call. A gig had been cancelled, can we fill in at short notice? Del was standing there mobile in hand clinging onto the fence. He swayed a little. Thought about it, and said "Yeah! We'll be there." "Shit Del! We're pissed we can't play tonight." "I need the money,and anyway we've got two hours to sober up." So we dashed of home to get our kit together. Me for my 12 string and my Mandolin, Del to go home and get some sleep, which I thought was pointless.  We got to O'Niells bar and fell through the door. Tony was totally sober,but resisted saying anything. I could tell he was really pissed with us.   We started playing after Tony had set up. The first set was appalling. I swear at one point, that we all started playing three different songs at the same time. After fifty minutes we came off stage. Del said "I know what the problem is." "What's that?" "Not enough beer. We need more beer." So he ordered another round. Then he said "We're getting there, we need another drink each." Eeeek!  So more drinks were ordered. Tony said "we're on in five minutes." Del said "Best we have a beer each to take on stage with us. Just to make sure." So more beer was ordered.  We staggered on stage. Now  you must realise that this was the weekend of the peterborough Beer festival and the whole audience had been to the festival as well and they were just as pissed as we were. The second set was incredible we played like we were fucking demons. At the end Del said "told you so. All we needed was more beer." I'll drink to that. So tonight we were rehearsing again. With my new band with no name. Some one suggested "Mike Da hat and friends". But I'm not convinced. So if you've any suggestions shout them out. Snadra never turned up. She was with her beloved.He's off on tour of America this week with his band and it's her last chance for a shag. So I think I'll forgive her that one. No excuses next week though. Simon thinks he's sold his Lotus Esprit so he'll be buying his J200 very soon. That's it. Tune in same time same channel for the next installment.   May your God be with you  Rock on  Mikel

      The power of caffiene. For someone like me it should never be under estimated. Last night I went out to dinner with Denise to a friend of mines house.The chairman of a large porcelein company was there. The people who make toilet bowls and bidets etc (that made for scintillating conversation) What a scoundrel he is.His secretary had to phone him up one day to tell him that two policemen were waiting for him in his office so he said he wasn't feeling well and stayed away from work so he didn't have to explain to the police how he had dented this guys car late at night whilst pissed and pulling away from an illicit rendezvous with this woman he shouldn't have. It's amazing what people confess whilst pissed round the dinner table. But me, I was stone cold sober, because I was driving and so had the advantage of being able to remember everything everyone said, for use at a later date. Ha Ha!!!!  Mind you I confess enough stuff to you guys so I guess I'm just as bad. There was a lot of money round that dinner table. One guy was a top man of some tyre company and travels all over europe. He told us something interesting. Two tyre companies merged a while back so the two companies became one but because of the history they remained virtually two companies with one on one floor and the other guys on the floor below. Then the MD decided that was ridiculous they had to merge properly. But it still didn't work because the one lot always turned up at work in their suits and ties and the other guys in jeans and T-shirts. The office space even had demarcation zones where the suits would have their desks and the jerk-offs theirs. So much rivalry and criticism. The suits seriously objected when the jeans guys decided to hold a cricket match in the entrance foyer of the Building, previously they had only just managed to tolerate the golf tournaments in the offices and corridors. So dinner was nice we had Gnocchi (OK that might not be how you spell it) but it tasted nice then moules maraniere then fruit fondu. Now that was fun. You get all this fruit on a plate in the middle of the table grapes, strawberries, pineapple chunks, raspberries, banana chunks, you name it. Then there is a bowl of molten chocolate with a table candle underneath to keep it melted. You have a spear and get your fruit chunk and dip it in the chocolate then eat it.  Eeeek! I love chocolate, but I can't eat it. It was driving me crazy, the smell of hot chocolate wafting across the table was enough to make the hardest heart weaken. So I chose a strawberry and dipped it in. Friends I've got to tell you this it was one of the most delicious mouthfuls of food I have experienced in years. The strawberry so succulent and tasty with the chocolate just melting onto my tongue, it was an almost religious experience, you could even describe it as intensely sexual. God it was nice. But boy did I pay for it. Just one tiny bit of chocolate. I was on a promise last night. Denise had come down to see me and was stopping the night. We got back to my flat and she was there all expectant and naked and being really cute. All I could see was flashing lights and I had a splitting headache. Shit! Thank you GOD! I was losing the power of speach. I started stuttering, hardly romantic but to be honest sex was the last thing on my mind. All I wanted to do was sleep. I fell into bed and passed out.  I was woken next morning at 5:30 Denise had to get back to go to work. I was dieing. She left and I went back to bed to wake again at 8:00. I opened the shop. I was not feeling well. I struggled until 1:00 then went to bed again and slept until closing time. All for one poxy little bit of chocolate. I would have preferred a  hangover. It would have been better if I'd have drunk too much at least then I know the hangover would be over by 10:00am. Experience has taught me this. As it was I only had one pint all Sunday. Ever felt cheated?  I've got an incredibly good business opportunity for someone who is good with their hands. if you are interested. You may recall that Pat has a client list as long as your arm of perverts, cross dressers and the like. Well she was asked this week if she knew of a discrete carpenter. It seems one of her customers is a baby man, he has since formed a relationship with the dominatrix I told you about a few months ago, well they want building for them, larger versions of cots, high chairs, and changing tables. Really! No questions asked, no pack drill.  Then there are the sado masochists who want all sorts of equipment building that I can't begin to describe. They will pay over the odds. So you can forget your high finance deals, your multi national corporations, you just build these guys what they want and you charge what you like. No arguments. Money for old rope.  That's where the money is. In sex. I've known that for a long time but not had the courage or the inclination to do anything about it. People will pay good money for their BASIC requirements, and they don't argue for fear of publicity. We could have a franchise "sex toys R us". A branch in every major city or town. We could rake it in. One of her customers is a high court judge. He is so polite with her. She can charge him anything and he pays without question. That's why she is now driving a fuck off sports car and lives in a £300,000 house. And that's from starting with nothing two years ago.  What are we doing wrong?

      Well Sandra and I hit Geneva's Bar. We'd been rehearsing all the early evening and got our set note perfect. Simon was late and Sandra was panicking. She's never played live before. Simon and I are old pro's. With the emphasis on old. We met Sandra six months ago as a enthusiastic amateur and we made it our mission in life to get her into a band and train her in the art of playing live, never suspecting it would be our band.  WE got on stage ready for the first number, Sandra says "I can't remember the chords." "WHat? You played it perfectly earlier." "It's all gone."  and bless her she was shaking like a leaf.  I started playing Rod Stewarts "I don't wanna". It's a good job Im playing a 12 string it's worth two guitars in sound. She fell apart. TRied a few chords then stopped playing tried a few more an stopped again.  Then it was a fleetwood Mac number "dreams" she was singing. That went well and she was getting into her strie. until finally we did Free bird. Sandra slung on her Mandolin and we rocked it out. Brilliant fun. WE came off stage Sandra threw herself into the arms of her loved one. He's another professional musician. But that's another story.  Anyway in walks some friends of mine. Abi and her band Within. (Check out their website www.within-band.co.uk)To see Abi is to love her, she is a free spirit I guess. It's hard to pin down what it is about her. Her boyfriend describes her as a gift to the world and I can see what he means. She is special. I leant Richard my 12 string and they went on stage. Incredible. Abi has such stage presence and her band plays brilliantly.   Simon phoned today. Wants to go on a road trip. We are on a mission. To buy a Gibson J200 guitar. He's found one in Bath. So we're taking days off work to go and buy it. J200? Hey it's a geetar. But not just any old geetar it's a fuck off geeetar. costs about uk£2000. Eeek he's selling his Lotus esprit to buy it.

      what better way to spend Sunday or indeed any other Sunday than to have a lie in with the missus (without Joshua jumping all over you) followed by a leisurely read of one of the multisection broadsheets over breakfast of fresh brewed coffee and cornflakes. During which you wonder why there are so many sections to your Sunday paper. Appointments? Who the hell wants to worry about appointments on a Sunday, only the sad bastards who can't get a job any other day of the week. And  what about the business page? Who cares? The shops are shut anyway. Well ours is.It's supposed to be a day of rest so why encourage people to carry on working when they should be relaxing with the kids. Hang on that's a contradiction in terms. Kids and relaxation don't actually go hand in hand. I've come to the conclusion that the only reason I get this multisection broadsheet is because it has a damn good TV section so I don't have to buy the Radio Times or TV quick and get all the soap updates and the inside stories on programmes I don't ever watch. Anyway I've read what I've wanted to read and chivvy up the kids and go to the football. Our team "The Royal Oak" thrash the opponents 4:2. It was a great match. Now as you know I've been supporting "The Royal Oak" team for years. I even get offered coffee at half time. But the truth is I've never once set foot inside that particular pub. They don't have a huge following usually there's me, Phil, my brother in  law, the landlord of the pub and his wife and the substitutes and an old chap called George who must be at least one hundred years old. Today he nudged me after he had said something to the opponents coach saying "Do you know what? I love to pull his pisser." Then after the victory we retire to the pub. This time the Botolph Arm where we join the other Sunday lunchtime set over a couple of pints of Sam Smiths. So there we are, Phil and I discussing Mendeleev and the periodic table while the other Sunday lunchtimers are chatting passing round the sections of the same broadsheet I'd left at home. The kids wanted to play snooker and we gave them a quid. Later the barman came over to us to ask us if we could tone the children down a mite. They were getting a tad boisterous, argueing over who's turn it was and whether a shot could be retaken and the finer points of the rules for instance whether Rosalind could legally belt Caroline over the head with the cue. Christ! it's not as if any of them are Steve Davis. But that's tame compared with what they were doing earlier. You remember I mentioned the periodic table well they thought it was a hoot to think up new compounds that spelt out rude words. For instance Sulphur Hydogen Iodine and Titanium. They rocked with laughter. Phil and I tried to maintain our composure by showing a joint face of indifference and at the same time wondering if other parents had the same problem. That's the problem with having intelligent children they still go through the toilet humour stage just like the rest of them but it's more sophisticated. "Iodine Carbon Uranium Phospherous." said one of them and they all fell about. We sat their stoney faced.  "Don't you get it?" they screamed. "I see you pee!" and they fell about even more. God what have we spawned? So suitably flushed with the old Sam Smiths we head on for home and a siesta in front of the telly. It would have been a great film but I missed most of it. "The lady Vanishes". Well she Vanished and then I woke up and there she was again playing a piano with Elliot Gould and Cybill Shepherd walking into the room. And the titles ran. So what happened in the meantime? Who cares? It's Sunday.  So what happened at the fireworks? Well Dangerous Dave let off a Smoke flare. And it stained the side of the swimming pool bright red. Whoops! He tried to clean it with a yard brush but the stain is there to stay. Rob Harrison suggested that we put on our dry suits get in the water and  take a wire brush to the pool side. And if that didn't work he was going to put a wire brush on his black and decker. Now I don't know if that was the drink talking or not but if he's getting in the pool with a Black and Decker I'm getting out. I don't fancy two hundred and forty volts in the same water as me. Amy lit a firework and accidently dropped it into the water. It carried on burning, glowing eerily like something from the Quatermass experiment. Pulsing as each section caught. Other than that it was a good night.  Yet again I have been asked if all these stories I tell you are true. Do I make it all up? Well friends I have to tell you this. It's all true. Everything I tell you really did happen, give or take a few liberties of poetic licence. A few embellishments. But it's a writers perogative. I've got to make it interesting. For instance today I could tell you I got up went to the football went to  the pub came home fell asleep and woke up. What sort of story is that? At least I don't have the excuse that I was born in Peterborough.  "Nothing ever happens to me." "Why?" "Well I was born in Peterborough." "So?" "Well you've lived. You've been about. You've done this, done that, I was born in Peterborough so what chance do I have?" Surely there must be someone born in Peterborough who has done something? I can't believe that a prerequisite of having an exciting life is to have been born anywhere but Peterborough. Perhaps it's the local mentality. Thank Christ I didn't get here til I was twenty something. I tried an experiment on my children (who were born here) "tell me the most exciting thing that has ever happened to you." They shrugged their shoulders. Nothing. "Ok what about the most interesting thing that has ever happened?" Again a shrug of the shoulders. "Gemma. What about the time we got up real early in the morning to watch the meteors?" "Oh yeh! That was good." "Tell me about it." "Well.......... we got up and looked at meteors." "And................" "It was cold." "And..............." "It was early in the morning every one was asleep." "And.............." "And ..... and .....I was born in bloody Peterborough alright?" SO there you have it. If your wife is pregnant keep her away from Peterborough. Try Rotherham. In fact try not to even concieve your child in Peterborough. You may live to regret it. I was fortunate I was born in Wales. OK sound the death knell straight away I lose all crediblity now. Bloody welsh bastard. But my saving grace was my parents are both thoroughbred Yorkshire people.  Yorkshire, Gods country. I spent my early years in Yorkshire learning to speak like a northerner. I had to because at school they'd beat the crap out of me because I was a southern bastard who spoke funny. Then when we moved to Buckinghamshire I used to get the crap beaten out of me because I was a northern bastard who spoke funny. Then we moved to Cyprus and everyone spoke funny. I liked Cyprus. Then we moved back to blighty and I hadn't a fucking clue how to speak. So I adapted to whereever I found myself. That's one of the problems with being a forces brat. You travel a lot. I remember I got to Aylesbury and one of my first friends there was Paul Merridan. I asked him where he lived he said "Princes Risborough." So I aked him how long he'd lived there. "All my life." "WHAT? ALL your life?" "Yes why?" And to him it was the most natural thing in the world. To me I couldn't believe anyone could stay in the same village all their lives let alone the same house. It was a revelation to me. I'd just assumed that everyone moved every two years.  "So Paul what's happened to you in your life?" "Nothing." "anything exciting?" "NO I was born in Fucking Princes Risborough alright?" There could be a trend building up here. IT may not just be the Peterborough effect.  Here's a thing, this year I celebrate thirty five years of having normal ears. When I was born they had to use Barnes Wallis forceps to deliver me because my ears were so large. I mean they stuck out so wide they were stuck in the uterus. Worse than a breach birth. It was touch and go whether I'd make it or not. Well I mentioned at school they used to beat the crap out of me because I spoke like a southerner well that's not the whole truth. They used to beat they crap out of me because not only did I speak like a southerner I had these huge ears. I was called "Dumbo" or "Jumbo" or "Big ears" or "Mickey Mouse" or even "Mickey Big Ears". They used to throw me out of upstairs windows to see if I could fly. Well to a five year old that was really hurtful. So when we got south I had plastic surgery. Thirty five years ago. You can still see the scars. My ears are now svelte. Streamlined. I don't look like Prince Charles. And with all his money, or mummys money why didn't he have the same operation. He could have come into hospital with me and met Ringo Starr like I did. Well he said he was Ringo Starr and what can a six year old do but believe?  Looking back what Ringo Star was doing in an RAF hospital was anyones guess.  I'd like to tell you more but I live in fucking Peterborough alright?  Mikel

      We (ad Hock) played Geneva’s bar last night. We got there early to set up so we could watch the football. The instructions were we don’t play until the football was finished. So we sat and had a few beers, and some Rachi or is it Rakki? Del had O.D.ed on the stuff whilst on honey moon and he was determined I should  try some. So we went outside where his wife was parked up waiting for us with bottle of Rachi and some glasses. Great drink, aniseed flavoured, although I was thinking, a few seconds after swallowing the stuff, of Gollum screaming “It burns, it burns ussssss.” Del was getting restless wanting to get on stage.Tony laid back as usual said “Look at it this way Del. We’re getting paid to sit here drink beer and watch football. How many jobs give you that?” Across from us were a group of foreigners who were intent on drinking the pub dry of Stella Artois.  Spookily enough they were the only ones shouting “Eng-er- land” eventually one of them collapsed in an alcoholic stupor sending pints of Stella flying to the floor. None of them moved they just stared at him. Poked him a bit to make sure he was unconscious then stole his beer,  and bought yet more Stella Artois.  A few pints later he’s still unconscious and the others are getting close so with 15 minutes of normal time to play they stand up to go. One stumbles and falls on Del who catches him. He apologises profusely. IN Latvian or summat, so he could easily have been telling Del anything like “next time I am falling on you I will break your stupid head.” So we guessed it was an apology by the tone of his voice. Two of them pick up their unconscious buddy and drag him out the pub the toes of his shoes been polished to a nice shine on the carpet.  It got to the penalties and the punters were pulling their hair out and screaming and burying faces in hands. I thought this is going to be a hard crowd tonight.  We started playing just after 10:30. It turned out the crowd wanted to be entertained after all. So a great time was had. After a while we stopped for a break and the hostess came up to me and said “I didn’t realise you were so good. We’re going to have to have you back here again. A Sunday night next time it’s usually packed,  I’ll give you a call.” Great! We finished at one in the morning and the landlord said “Will you be stopping to have a drink with us lads?” Daft question really. Of course we’d have a free beer with him.  Well one free beer turned into two which turned into three along with the Kentucky fried chicken which was being handed out.  A tall guy was there with us indulging in several glass of the dark stuff. He started singing caberet.   “Start spreading the news” Doo doo di doo do do doo di doo “I’m leaving today.”  And he’s falling about throwing his arms around Del and my shoulders urging us to sing along. “I wanna be a part of it “ raising to a crescendo  “NEW YORK NEW YORK……. Someone give me a mouth organ…… I wanna mouth organ……..has anyone got a mouth organ here?”  I think he’d lost the plot somewhere. Del and I fell out the door at 3am and got a taxi home. This morning oh joy ! I had a parcel arrive. Wonderful. It was my new football t-shirt to wear at the pub during the football. Only trouble is we’ve been knocked out the tournament, so it’s a day too late. C’est la vie.  There’s always another football tournament England can lose in. I must tell you that I am not actually a football fan. So this may be the first and last time I ever mention football here.  Gotta go I need to rest. We’re playing the Fox at Folkesworth tomorrow night. That will be another late night I guess.

      Let me tell you about John. (Check out previous posting) John came to me one night and told me he used to be the chief engineer for the Saudi Hydro Electric power project. Hello? Plenty oil, not much water. So he let me in on his latest project which he couldn’t understand why no one would let him go ahead with it. That is to flood the entire Nene valley and make it into a huge water park for boating and such like. I pointed out that if he did that Peterborough and more importantly where he lived would be under twenty foot of water.  Another John would walk around with his fore arm stretched out in front of him. He had a lobster resting on his arm.  If he dropped his arm the Lobster would fall off. No one could see the Lobster but we all knew it was there. I asked him one day if it ever fell off when he took off his coat.  He looked at me incredulously. “No of course not. It just dematerialises for a second then comes back.” “Doesn’t it get tiring having to hold your arm up like that all the time so the Lobster won’t fall off?” “It’s a fucking pain.” He said. “So why don’t you just shake it off?” “It would be really pissed with me.” “But it’s just a lobster.” “They bite you know.” “Yes I know.” I replied “Do you want a really pissed Lobster  biting you?” “No I guess not but surely you can run away from it when you’ve shaken it off?” “No it just comes back and it’s really pissed and angry and then it hurts me so I have to be careful with it.”  I’m not sure if I’ll ever understand the schizophrenic mind. They have logic that is totally illogical but real to them. Another John said to me one night “Can you come back tomorrow and walk with me to the post office?” “Why?” “Because they all laugh at me.” “Who laughs at you?” “Everyone. And I don’t know why.  So if you came with me you can tell me if they really are laughing at me or not. I need to get my money but I can’t if everyone is  laughing at me.” “I’m sure they’re not. Perhaps they’re just smiling at you to be friendly.” “But I can’t tell. I get nervous and the voices tell me things.” “Like what?” “That they are laughing at me. So will you come with me tomorrow? Please!” You could almost weep for him. We take it for granted that we do what we do. But these guys hear voices and have strange ideas that they can’t explain themselves. To them  it’s real. To us they’re crazy. It’s a chemical imbalance in the brain. They have medications to control the extremes and mostly they work, except for some it leaves them very tired, lethargic and unable to function properly.  I got into trouble a while back. Giving my guitar lessons a couple of the inmates started refusing their “meds”.  The duty officer came to me and said “Have you been telling them that this is music therapy?” “No. Why?” “Because they claim they don’t need their medication because they’ve had music therapy instead. So could you emphasise that you are not giving them any therapy, you’re just giving them music lessons.”

       urlLink    "The Kidnaps" at The Wheatsheaf Peterborough 18th June 2004.  Julian is playing base. he told me that he had just one and a half weeks to learn the set as he was standing in for their regular bass player. The singer is James he describes himself as "The guy with the long girly hair". Justin (guitar right) is manic. I've never seen anyone so enthusiastic. The previous night they played The fiddlers Elbow in the battle of the bands competition and won. They played in your face heavy rock. but for this night they played acoustically. For my money it was better, you could see the talent in their playing. Excellent night.&nbsp; urlLink

      Where Do I find the time to do all this stuff? I don’t know. It just kinda happens. It’s like I’m driven to keep going, to never stop,  because if I do…….hell I don’t even want to contemplate what would happen if I stopped doing stuff and actually relaxed. Probably nothing but there’s something in the back of my mind that starts going into panic mode if I’ve got nothing to do. So I was doing this guitar workshop at a home for Schizophrenics. Yeah really! I kid you not. I can’t mention any names to protect the guilty so for the sake of  this story all the schizophrenics are called John. So I turn up with a car full of guitars and  report to the evening duty officer. “Is John ready for the Guitar workshop?” “Yes he’s been looking forward to it all day. He’s in his room go and knock on his door.” So I went to his room knocked on the door and muffled voice screamed out “Come in!” I walked in.  John was sitting in his arm chair with his back to me masturbating furiously with a biro stuck in the end of his dick. Eeeek! I quickly turned round and walked out, shutting the door quietly behind me.  I walked into the common room to wait for John and a man dressed in a three piece suit walked in, head held high and hands clasped behind his back. He had a definite air of authority.  He looked about the room, like a sergeant major inspecting barracks.  “Everything OK? Yes? Fine. Excellent.  Good to see everything running smoothly. I’ll be in my office if you need me.” He walked out.  I turned to the duty manager, who had just walked in. “Who’s that?” “Oh that’s John. He likes people to think he runs the place.” “And he doesn’t?” “No he’s quite mad. Lovely guy though.” So another John came in for his guitar workshop session and I started playing something. “Thank you for the days” “You know what Mike? I wrote that.” “Wrote what?” “That song you were playing.” “No that was Ray Davis of the Kinks.” I say firmly. “Yeah that’s what they want you to think.”  “Who wants me to think?” “Them. Y’know them.” he says confidential like. “So have you written any songs for the Beatles or the Stones.” He goes into a panic and starts looking around furtively this way and that “Keep it fucking down.” He hissed, “nobody writes beatles or stones songs and admits to it.” “Why?” “Because it’s a cut throat business out there, they’ll cut your throat if they found out you were writing songs for the Rolling stones or the Beatles.” “So what’s the most famous song you’ve written.” “My most successful was “My way” sung by Frank Sinatra.” “Really? When did you write that?” “I wrote that about 1986. You know, that was a bastard as well. I wrote it on the Friday and by Monday morning bloody Frank Sinatra was singing it on bloody Radio 2. I never got a penny in royalties, not one penny. Do you think I should write to them to complain? I’ve often though of doing that.” “Yes but just remember what you said before it’s a cut throat business, you start making demands for royalties and they've instantly got your name and address.” “You’ve got a point I’d better keep quiet." Later on I saw the sergeant major and asked him if he wanted to join me for a coffee.  “Absolutely old boy. Love to.” He stopped at the door of the kitchen. “I’m afraid I can’t come into the ol’ kitchen.” “Why is it restricted or something?” “No the cupboards will eat me.” “What?” “The cupboards will eat me if I go into the kitchen.” “But they’re just cupboards. Boxes of wood with doors on them. There’s no teeth or muscles, no brain, nothing, just an inanimate box.” John flared up “Don’t you think I know that? Do you think I’m stupid?” “No no it’s just a little difficult for me to se the problem.” I said, back peddling as fast as possible. “Well that’s alright. I know it’s just a box an’ all.” “So let’s go and get this coffee shall we?” “Sure.” “You coming?” “NO I can’t the cupboards will eat me.”  I'll tell you more about the Johns another day.

      Well I have to tell you the Kidnaps went down really well Friday night.It wasn’t a packed house but 80% of the pub goers were listening to the band.  They played virtually the same set as the night before but  acoustically. It worked. Unfortunately at the end of the evening the landlord  wasn’t happy.  Bless him, he’s been understaffed for the last few weeks and has worked 7am until 1:00am for the last week, so he was tired. I’d had a great evening and had a few beers so I wasn’t in any position, or inclination, to argue with him. So Tony, my friend from Ad Hock, chatted with him on my behalf. Basically he said The Kidnaps were not the sort of band he wanted in his pub. OK onwards and sideways, I’ll go and have a chat with him later and find some bands he does want on stage.  Saturday was my turn to be on stage with Ad Hock at the Swiss cottage. Brilliant fun.  In the toilets this guy came to me and started telling me he was an editor of a magazine. Poetry world.   “Wow! A poetry magazine. I’ve written two books of poems none of them published. I was thinking of having a book of rejection letters.” He looked at me as if I was mad. “Poems? I don’t do poems. I do poultry, not poetry. It’s poultry world. Not poetry world.” “Oh! What they hell is there to write about chickens.” “You’d be surprised. It’s a huge business.” I think I’ll wait to be surprised.  Sunday Sandra and I played Charters. Mike da Hat and friend. No Simon. Haven’t spoken to him in over a week now. I guess he still has problems. WE arrived at the boat (Charters) and dale was sitting there playing guitar. he’d been playing an hour. “Do you want me to take over?” I asked. “Please.” So I started playing. Smashy turned up with his amplifier and microphone and when that was set up, while I was playing, I called Sandra up on stage and we started our set.  Forgot to capo the guitar for “Aint no sunshine” so Sandra had to sing it down in her boots. She struggled. But the rest went down really well. That is until the bar manager told us to turn it down a bit. At the end I spoke to dale and asked him if he’d like to play a showcase night for me. he didn’t seem to keen until I told him he’d be sharing the bill with Richard and Abi from within. Then he leapt at it. Seems he’s a great fan of Richard and Abi and their band.  So that’s the next Showcase night sorted. Just got to speak to Steve the landlord to confirm it. Hope he’s still keen on the idea, especially as I’ve got publicity for the event in the newspaper.

      Last night I went to the "Band of the year" competition. Or battle of the bands. Whatever. They had a really curious way of deciding the winner.On entering the venue we were all given voting slips. OK they were raffle tickets but what the hell! So that seemed sensible. Each person had a chance of voting. But then I was given another voting slip when I bought a drink. Hmmmm? I looked along the bar and everyone was getting extra voting slips with each drink ordered. So then we had the situation whereby the people most incoherent with alcohol, the most unlikely to be able to think clearly would have the most votes. Wow! Who thought that one up? Well my friends in the band "The Kidnaps" won the competition. Now does that mean their fans were the most outrageously drunk, or did they just have more fans or were they actually the best band?  I wonder what would happen if the government introduced this voting system to decide who runs the country? I know in the pub I go to there are always a load of people who think they can run the country better than any elected government. Especially after copious amounts of beer. This must be the way forward. So let's go to the pub and decide the fate of the country over a few beers. It sounds much more civilised than the slanging matches we have in the houses of parliament.  Rock on dudes.

      Just been to the Fiddlers Elbow to see the band (The Kidnaps) I am showcasing tomorrow night (Friday). It was a "Battle of the bands" competition sponsored by The Live music centre and The evening telegraph. Well The Kidnaps won and I'm very pleased. Admittedly they were quite heavy. but they told me that they are looking forward to playing this gig acoustically. They said "It's gonna be very different. Laid back and mellow." So I'm looking forward to that. Had a call from Richard and Abi tonight. They've confirmed that they'll play the 9th July. I can't wait. I've told you about Richard and Abi before.But it's worth repeating. Richard is a brilliant guitarist and Abi is an incredible vocalist,  she has such stage presence. Check out their website:  www.within-band.co.uk  Who to put on with them? Eeek! That's a toughy. Obviously they'll be the headline act but who to put on first? I'll have to think about that very carefully. Being a music promoter isn't as easy as it first appears. There's so much going on behind the scenes that the vast majority of the public don't even know about, or care about. But hey! It's a lot of fun. I wonder if my ex-wife, Vikki, will play a set? Now there's a thought. She is good. She's very good. I might ask her. Good job, even though we're divorced, we're still friends. I'll let you know what she says.   May your God be with you  Rock on!

      Met a new person in my pub the other day. Quite an amazing girl. Young enough to be my daughter.  She’s slim with short brown hair and petite. I was introduced to her by someone who was talking about fishing.  “That’s  where I’ve just come from.” she said, looking like the most unlikely fishing type that ever walked this earth. Dressed in her smart black jacket andblue jeans.  “Yeah right!”  “No.  Really I love fishing it’s my way of relaxing after a hard week in London.” “So what do you do in London?” “Oh I’m a stripper.” she said it like she might have been telling me she was a secretary or something. “And I do a bit of pole dancing, some private work, you know.” “Why a stripper?” “Because I’m not stupid. I’m intelligent and educated, I speak five languages, French, Spanish, German, Italian and of course English.” “But with all that talent, again why be a stripper?” “I’m 22 next birthday. Next month I’ll  be moving into my new house. It’s  costing me over £200,000. I’m paying for it in cash. Now  you tell me why I shouldn’t be a stripper. By the time I’m 30 I’ll be retired and living an easy life.” Well I don’t know how much of that was true. How much of it was spin. But I tried her out on her languages. First French then Spanish. She could certainly speak those two. I can’t vouch for the German as I’ve never learnt it. So she could have said anything and I wouldn’t have been any wiser. The italian sounded convincing too. Leslie was sitting near me. She leant over when the girl had gone to the bar, and hissed at me “Don’t encourage her.” “I’m not encouraging her. I’m just talking, finding out stuff. I’m a writer I have to know about stuff.” “But she’s a .......prostitute.” “So what? Does that make her evil? I don’t think so. She’s certainly clever.” “She’s after something and you don’t want to have any part of it.” My stripper friend came back after getting herself a drink at the bar. “So what do you do Mr Hat?” she asked looking at me over the top of her glass. “I’m an electrician, part time musician, part time writer and I used to be a biologist.” “I’ve always been interested in science. I took a course in quantum physics a while back, You know all that stuff about breaking down atoms into electrons and neutrons and protons then breaking them down a bit more into positrons and gluons and all those other strangely named sub atomic particles, hey did you know one of the particles is actually called strangeness?” “Yes Quark ,Strangeness and Charm. It’s the title of a Hawkwind Album.” Well guys I’m still not totally convinced but she was interesting if nothing else. “Thank God! She’s gone.” says Leslie,  “I thought she was trying to get in your wallet, via your pants.” “Leave it out.  You don’t half talk some rubbish.” “I call it like I find it. And she’s no good. You mark my words.”

      I have a great view from where I am sitting.  Across the road is a cemetary. In the middle of this city it's a beautiful patch of green. OK full of dead bodies but hey you can't have everything. The council deliberately don't cut the grass round the sides, to allow wild flowers to grow. I can stand in the middle of all this grass and without moving my feet I can stretch out and touch at least 8 different species of grass alone. (I didn't tell you I used to be a biologist, but the money was no good so now I'm an electrician and musician) anyway in the air above the cemetary I can see swarms of flying insects all picked out in the setting sunlight.   Saturday night we got to the pub to play. Spent a while setting up and got on stage.  We played two songs and the landlady asked me to come off stage.  They don’t have a full music license so only solo or duo artists are allowed to play. Not trio’s or bands. So I came off stage and became a member of the audience.  That’s hard you know.  I wasn’t angry with Jane the Landlady at all, it’s her pub it’s her license so she was doing the right thing. But  I just sat there as Del and Tony played the favourite songs I love to play.  Of course there were a few songs they couldn’t do without me. but they’ve got plenty material to cover for me not being there. So now I can only play in places with a full music license. There’s plenty of those. But some of our most fun gigs are in small intimate pubs.  Sunday phoned Simon to meet him at a pub in the afternoon. We had to discuss the plans for the showcase evenings and other stuff but his mind wasn’t on it. He had other worries to occupy his thoughts. He said he’d tell me all about it one day.  But for now he had to deal with it himself.  Today Sandra phoned, she wanted to know what was happening. I had to tell her that Simon was preoccupied with a few problems and we were on our own for a while. So we’re practicing tomorrow evening for a gig we’re gonna do just the two of us at Charters next Sunday. It won’t be the same without Simon but we can do it.  If he says he needs time, well he’s got it.  This guy came into the shop today with a grill element from an oven.  “Have you got one of these?” he asked. “What’s wrong with it?”  “I had an electrician round to look at my cooker and he says this element is faulty.”   I had a look at it and put a meter on it.  “Well? Whaddya think?” he said. “I think you need a  new electrician.” I said  “Why?” “The element is fine. What’s the symptoms of your oven?” “The fan oven doesn’t work, there’s no heat.” “So your electrician has sent you to find a grill element?” “So what DO I need?” “I guess you need a fan oven element.” “That makes sense, why didn’t he tell me that?” “Hmmm!”  So now I’m gonna go and play pool.

      We're playing the glass onion tonight. I had a long chat with Tony last night about the direction we want to go in with the band. He'd like me to play a few lead bits on mandolin. So I've been practicing the first song he suggested, in between customers, as I sit behind the counter. Should have that sucker nailed by tea time. I play with other people and bands but none is them is as much fun as playing with this band. We never rehearse. That is we never rehearse as a band. I practice a lot by myself, songs I know we are going to play. But most of the time I never know what I'm going to be playing.  Most of the songs we do I played for the first time ever while on stage. They rarely tell me what the next song is going to be and as for what key we're playing in; forget it. So I havea a split second to figure out what the song is, what key to play it in and then jump in and catch up. Often it's a song I've never played before. People in the audience just shout out songs for us to try. We give it a whirl. It's not often we're beaten totally, we usually manage a verse and a chorus at least. Anyway gotta play some more. See ya.

      Someone at Google has a wicked sense of humour. Try this out. Go to google.com and type in “weapons of mass destruction”, then hit the “I feel lucky” button. I wont spoil it by telling you what comes up. but try it. It’s very funny.  Had a phone call tonight, the first band to answer my ad in the music shop. It’s got to be a good sign. because the band is “Heathcliffe”. Two seperate people have independantly recommended them and I’ve been trying to get their number. So I’ve provisionally booked them, for the 30th July, subject to their audition. Their audition being  next Thursday at The Fiddlers Elbow, Peterborough. They are entered into the Peterborough Evening Telegraphs battle of the bands competition. So I’m taking a look. (Note to my children: Now you know why I’m taking you to the Fiddlers Elbow next week. Ha Ha!! Am I a cool dad or what?)  You know it’s great being the owner of your own business. If I worked for someone else I would have been sacked years ago because I don’t take things seriously enough. The concept that the customer is always right, is alien to me. Hells teeth I’m a professional I know my job. My customers come to me because I know what I’m talking about. Well one day this guy came tyo us with us shaver, it was very very old, obsolete in fact. But I told him we’d do our best for him. So I gave the shaver to my brother, Chris,  who is a genius at fixing things. He can fix stuff that’s not supposed to be fixed according to the manual. Luckily he never reads manuals.  He fixed it and when the customer came back, Chris said, “I’ve fixed it, but I can’t guarantee the repair, it may last another ten years but it may pack in next week. So don’t charge him anything.” Fair enough. So, full of bon hommerie, I present the customer with his shaver telling him we’d fixed it, but there was no charge.  The customer picked up the shaver and started looking at it very closely peering over the top of his glasses at it.  “Is there a problem?” I asked, in all innocence. “I think I’m being ripped off here.” “WHAT? How can you say that we are not charging you a  penny. You brought in an obsolete shaver that didn’t work, and now you have an obsolete shaver that does work, for no charge.” He looked a bit more at his shaver, turning it this way and that. “You are a bunch of charlatans.” Well that got me really angry because I had honestly thought we’d done this guy a favour. We didn’t have to go to the trouble of fixing it for him, we could have told him it was obsolete. We could have charged him £10 for the repair, but we didn’t. We were doing him a favour and this was how he repaid us.  he said a few more things that can’t be repeated so I pointed to the door and said “There’s the door, fuck off and don’t come back.” “You can’t talk to me like that. I want to speak to the manager.” “I AM the manager, and I’ll speak to you any way I choose in MY shop. So fuck off and don’t come back.”  He went, but not before threatening me with the trading standards office.  Like I’m suppose to be quaking in shoes over that one.  Two months later he came back, carrying something that needed fixing. The shop was full and I noticed him walk in the door. I guess he thought I wouldn’t remember him.  Either that or he was incredibly stupid. So I said to the customer I was serving “Excuse me one second. I have to deal with a difficult customer.”  I looked his way and said “I thought I told you never to come back to this shop.” Everyone turned round to look at him. He looked decidely sheepish and walked out. “now then where were we.........” I have to tell you that that was the first time I ever had to throw someone out of my shop. The rest of my customers are lovely people. I treat them like my best friends.  In fact a lot of them are.  They are all different. But they’re great. My customers make my life at work so much fun. I take the  piss out of them. I joke a lot. I call little old ladies “Miss”. I’ve even been know to entertain customers by playing my guitar. We have a sweety jar on the counter. I give away stickers and sweeties and poppers (bubble wrap) to the kids. Even the answerphone message when we’re shut is funny. If you’re really keen you can listen to it 01733 565128. Leave a message. I couldn’t do all this if I worked for John Lewis, or Radio Shack, or Currys. Because the customer is always right.  Who invented that phrase?  If the customer was always  right they wouldn’t need me.  Todays work uniform for me was Guiness T-shirt, shorts and trainers.  My father who started the business has long since given up trying to make me like him. I remember him telling me years ago “You can’t talk to customers like that!” “Why not?” “Because........” “They keep coming back. I rest my case.” Later on I noticed he was telling the same jokes as I was to customers.  You see being a shop keeper isn’t just being a shop keeper. It’s like an act. A part in a play. I play this part and I tell my jokes and it’s like a stand up comedy routine. When I was a teenager I vowed I would never work in a shop. I would rather die than demean myself by serving customers. But you know it’s one of the greatest jobs on earth, when you do it right. It’s so much fun. So I will eat humble pie and admit I WAS WRONG. My father, although as good as retired, still comes to the shop occassionally to “oversee things”, has given up criticising my methods. although he still rolls his eyes when I go into one. People tell me “you should be on stage”. But my shop IS my stage. Well that, and when I’m really on stage, playing guitar.  That’s it for now. Keep the faith. And may your God be with you.

      Some one phoned up the  shop yesterday. A young lady. It was an emergency she needed her sunbed fixing urgently. Hello!! It's 31C out there today and there's more rays out there than you can shake a stick at.   Today I had a phone call from a friend of mine.  "Hey can I send a young lady over to you to see if you can fix her hand buffer?" "Sure no problemo." So and hour later this girl walks in with an industrial car polishing machine. Not the  finger nail buffer I expected. She looked close to tears. "You gotta help me. I kinda broke it and now I've got to get it fixed." "It doesn't look broken, in fact it looks brand new." "It is brand new. But I broke it." "How?" "I cut the wires. I was having a bad day so I cut the wires." "What for?" "I was upset." "Ok let's have a look." "I've been to loads of places and they all say it can't be fixed." "I'll be the judge of  that." I said. So I took it apart and sure enough she'd cut the wire to the carbon brushes. So it wasn't so much she'd broken it but subtlely sabotaged it. Later in the conversation she let slip that she was in a hurry to pick up from another repairer, the industrial car valeting machine that she had similarly sabotaged along with a steam cleaner and vacuum cleaner.  Hmmm I wonder who'd upset her that much to make her do all that damage. Well I fixed it for her and she went away happy. Well as happy as an amateur sabateur can be.

      I asked. Some one replied by E-mail. Tell me the  Gordon Giltrap story. Last year I was asked to play guitar at a village hall near Stamford, I was to be the support act for Gordon Giltrap. Wow! I said yes straight away. Not because I was any good, or needed the money, but just because I could say I supported the Trap. Well on the night through some quirk, Gordon was playing first and me second. So technically I was  top billing. Gordon was brilliant. I say brilliant because he was. But to be honest after I’d heard three absolutely brilliant songs I got bored. There’s only so much brilliance a boy can take, only so much perfection. I sat there hoping beyond all hope that the Trap would make a mistake. just one little one, so he could stop being a God, and become a mere mortal like the rest of us. But the sod played it all note perfect. Don’t you just hate that. Well played his set and name dropped like mad a list of the famous he played with. All done in that easy matter of fact way, that shows us that to him it’s just an every day thing. He finished his set and when the tumultuous applause had died down announced that “Mike da hat is going to play his 12 string guitar for us, where are you Mike?” I put my hand up. “Here. Ready and waiting.” “Well I wouldn’t want to play 12 string myself. It takes forever to tune. So over to you Mike.”   Hmmmm having a  dig at me already? “Thanks Gordon. Oh yeah and thanks for doing the warm up act for me.” The crowd went wild with laughter and clapping. Gordon was not impressed and never spoke to me again. So while he was putting away his nine guitars at the front of the hall I set up at the back with my single twelve string. A good 75% of the audience pissed off, they’d only come to see the warm up act. But I was left with a decent crowd. I started playing. I got through a load of old favourites and had them singing along. Then the cleaners turned up. They started putting away the chairs that weren’t being used. Fair enough. It was only 10:30. But I carried on. No one told me to stop. Someone got up to visit the toilets came back and his chair was gone. I thought that was so funny I started laughing in the middle of a song.  I laughed more. I was laughing so much I had to stand up to play and someone took MY chair away. It was getting beyond a joke. Then one of the cleaners got out a hoover and started cleaning. WHAT? This was getting beyond a joke. There were murmurs  among the audience. Finally I gave up. There was no point battling against the sound of a vacuum cleaner. I packed away my guitar and went outside to join my friends.  “Where’s Pat?” I asked. “Can’t you hear her?” I listened. Pat’s voice came through loud and clear she was giving the organisers a piece of her mind. She told them in no uncertain terms that she’d never seen such downright ingorance and rudery. Yes rudery.  She was fuming. She had booked me to play at their request and this is how they treated a guest artist. their behaiviour was unforgivable. She finally came out, still shaking with anger.  “I need a drink” she said. “Let’s go back to my place.”  So we did. And that friends is what happens when you let  amateurs organise a professional gig.  Or more to the point small village amateurs, who are more used to organising coffee mornings.

      Life gets better and better. Yesterday we went to The Strawberry Jam on the embankment. There was no one there. So went to Charters. Charters is a pub on the river and I mean literally on the river, as it's a converted grain barge. Mike Fowler was there setting up his PA system for an afternoon of music.  WE asked about The Strawberry jam. Apparently the organiser was stuck in Cambridge after getting blasted. So the hippy chick was spark out on drugs instead of being here to organise things. Far out! So we had a few beers and a chat with Julian who is playing on my next showcase night on the 18th along with a band caled the Kidnaps. Mike played for half an hour then announced "Mike the hat is gonna play next" WHAT! Oh well.  So I got up on stage and took his guitar and started playing. Wild wood, Wild world, wild thing. in fact anything with wild in the title. Played for twenty minutes. It went ok. Meanwhile outside on the embankment people were wandering around with guitars looking for the action. No Strawberry Jam.  Went home to print out the flyers to take to the Wheatsheaf, the definitive list for the night, E-mailed the newspaper and a music mag. Stepped outside and walked straight into Richard from Within. He agreed that he and Abi would do a set on the showcase night 9th July. Fabulous. I said I'd let him borrow my 12 string again to do pink floyds "wish you were here". Saturday night we went to Goodbarns yard to see my friends Pip and Steff playing with their band The Electric Warriors (That's a reference to Marc Bolan I think)anyway Steff wants to do a spot as well so I've pencilled him in for the 30th July. He has this plan for a set including himself, Pip, a saxophonist and Cat. Cat plays electric violin in my friend Tonys band Pooks Hill. So that should  be really interesting.  So we hit The Wheatsheaf, stopping to talk to Julian and jac's on the way, to show them the advertising flyer we'd produced. Negotiated a fair rate of pay for the nights. Which is great because now we can afford to pay the bands something. Not a lot, but enough for their beer money on the night. So I'm happy at that. Simon and I could have trousered the lot. But we're neither of us money grabbing little bastards. OK we want to be paid for our work but at the same time it's nice to be able to pay the players something. So things are really panning out great for the showcase nights. Everything seems to be falling into place nicely.  Don't you just love the music biz?

      Went to see the hound dogs last night. Great band. They play rockabilly stuff. Three young lads but great showmen. They don't just play, they entertain. They all sport impossibly large quiffs, the drummers quiff actually points vertically upwards by about eight inches. At times the drummer sets fire to his cymbals using lighter fluid. Then he crashes the cymbals making the fluid jump and it all flares up. Brilliant. There were the usual bunch of interesting people there. Like the young girl who stood right in front of the double base player arms over her head playing with her hair and trying to look real cute. Or the guy sitting near to me who was so drunk he put his coat on backwards, like an operation gown.   Got an E-mail from the Evening Telegraph, finally seem to have found someone who wants to do something. Looks like I'll have to change my opinion of them. They could be redeeming themselves. Although yesterdays paper announced the hound dogs playing sunday. And tonight a band called Mind the gap. But I know my Friends Pip and Steff are playing tonight. So they've still got a lot of work to do to get it right. It's not as if it's rocket science.  Tomorrow is the Strawberry Jam. Previously we've had the willow festival. But the organisers decided that they'd taken it as far as they coould and gave up. Which is a great shame because it was a great event. A free music festival over three days. Usually seven stages, loads of those ethnic stalls selling T-shirts posters and piercings. Along with marijuana seeds and pot paraphanalia. Tie died dresses and the usual alternative life style products.  But tomorrow we've got Strawberry jam. An unofficial free music festival. Featuring loads of bands playing unplugged acoustic instruments. The organiser Trina (a latter day hippy) told me they expect to be closed down by the police because they haven't got permission to stage the event. So that's gonna  be interesting. Think I'll go down and have a nose. Check out the groups and see if I can find any talent that needs to be put on a proper stage.  Trina says my friend Abi will be there. http://www.within-band.co.uk Hmmm wonder if she'll sing at one of my showcase nights? That would be nice. urlLink

      After seeing my kids tonight I went to the pub. I was parched. I was going to have just the one pint then come home. Andy was sitting at the other bar as usual all by himself staring dead ahead and occasionally rolling himself a fag. He's there everynight, never speaks to anyone. I usually say "hello", just to be friendly. he grunts at best, but usually ignores me. One night last week I slapped him on the back and said "Hey Andy! Great to see you how's it going?" He ignored me. Sraaring dead ahead and not moving. One hand on his usual pint of kronenberg 1664. later that same evening we happened to be at the free standing urinals together.  "What's the matter Andy? Would you rather I didn't speak to you?" He said nothing. So I got pissed off with him.  "Look I'm trying my best to be friendly. I don't want to swap spit or anything. So why are you such a miserable bastard?" "I keep myself to myself. All you have to do is say hello and I'll nod. I don't need any more than that." "Ok Andy. We'll just nod to each other then." "And don't hit me on the back again. I'm not a fucking baby who wants burping." Well that told me.  Sandra wants me to tell you all about her and her beloved in this blog. God! I hate that word. I'm a writer, not a blogger.  The other night she said to me "tell the world about me and Franco"."Write a story about the two of us. Make it up if you want." But I aint one to make up stories. I write it as it is. So tonight I'm not going to say anything more. Just to tease her. I might write about them another day. When I am inspired. It's almost a teenage love affair. Even though they are not teenagers anymore. So I'll bide my time. Chrikey have I contradicted myself?  Today a woman came into the shop. She said "are you the guy in the band?" I said "Yes. But which band?" "I saw you new years eve." "that will be Ad Hock then." "yes can you play at my wedding?" "I'll phone Tony and find out." I phoned Tony. We're clear for the 3rd July.  Last night I went to Geneva's to check out the scene. No one turned up, just Mike Fowler with the PA. he'd already played by himselkf for three quarters of an hour. So we sat and had a few beers chatting. he said "are you playing tonight?" I said "No I haven't brought my guitar." "You can borrow mine." "I've had a few beers. I can't play." Now I have this rule I don't play if I'd had a few beers. but then when I've had a few beers I don't care so I play. Badly. But I stuck to my guns and said no. That's the sensible me. So I had another beer. And Mike went up on stage and did a few more. Then out of desperation to get someone to play something. anything. he got this girl Trina to play tin whistle. So she did a few Irish numbers and came off stage.  "ladies and Gentlemen. Mike da hat is going to play!" What could I do?  He'd announced me. I couldn't say no. So I played Elton John's "Your song" and "Rocket man" followed by cat stevens "Wild world". NO audience response at all. No reaction whatever. So I did Louden wainwrights "Rufus is a tit man" very risqué" still no response. So to take the piss out of the audience I sang "How sweet to be an idiot." I came off stage and people came up to me saying "brilliant" "So why didn't you clap?" "no one else was, so I couldn't be arsed." OK the honest answers are the best. It's tough being a musician sometimes.  You thrive on audience response. When they don't respond you die.  Or you take the piss. So they paid me. I played, they paid. What's the big deal? A dead crowd that's what it is. It's not the money, it's the reaction of the audience.I would play for nothing if the audience was good. I often go to see other groups play and I sit there in the audience wishing I was up there instead of them. That's the difference. I love to play for my audience. But sometimes my audience don't give a shit.  last year I played support for Gordon Giltrap. He was amazing but it turned out, for logistical reasons, he was on first. So I made a joke that he warmed up the audience for me. I think that really pissed him off because he never spoke to me again. But that's another story for later. Make a comment if you want to read the full story.   Meanwhile I have a lovely bed that's calling me.  Rock on  May your god be with you.  Mikel

      The other year we had a Tattoo parlour situated next to our shop.  Guys would turn up and go to the corner shop for some liquid anaesthetic, usually in the form of Tennants super, which is quite frankly, almost impossible to drink uless at freezing point. There was this one guy, on the dole and a staunch Manchester United fan. Surprise surprise. He'd been begging Rob the tattooist to do him a cheap tattoo. Rob not been short of work refused. he was inundated for requested for the old spiders webs on the elbow, celtic flashes, "cut here" round the neck etc etc. Eventually the Man U fan bet him that he was so hard that he could stand having a tattoo done on the soles of his feet.  Not only that a tattoo of scorpions. Just to prove he was really hard. Well one afternoon I found him in our carpark slumped against a wall with four empty cans of Tennants super rolling about the carpark by the side of him. He was almost ready to endure the tattoo.  Well apparently he did. because the next week he had a four inch square tattoo of the Man U emblem tattooed on to  the front of his neck just under his chin. I haven't seen him in ages. Not since the council took away his children into care. Hmmmm

       urlLink    This is us playing at the Wheatsheaf Peterborough. We never managed to think of a name for the band, well not a good one so we became Mike Da hat (me ) and friends. Bit like Jools Holland and friends but not so good. I think we were just getting into the thrash bit of Freebird when this pic was taken. Whoopeee!&nbsp; urlLink

       Took the boy to the cinema last night. Got there to find my daughter Gemma, sitting on the grass outside with boyfriend. She was wondering how to get home as Matt (the boyfriend) only had one crash helmet for his motor bike. I said I'd take her home but only after the Jamie and I had seen the film so she might as well come with us and see it too.  Stepford wives.  Yes it was funny but not brilliant.  Gemma was wearing this short blue dress and high heeled shoes. She is going to disown me if I tell you this, but she is not used to high heeled shoes and was tottering around. I couldn't help laughing.  You see my Gemma is more a jeans, sweat shirt and training shoes type of girl. So to see her in a dress is unual. She was  pleased because she almost made a car crash,  the driver was paying more attention to her than the road as he drove past.  Another couple of guys whistled and shouted at her.  She said "I think I'd better wear this dress more often. I'm getting loads of attention."  After taking the kids home I went on to Dels. He was throwing a little soirée for the band in his back garden. He took great delight in playing a new song he'd found by a band call AC Dixy a country and western group that played heavy metal in a blue grass style. OK it sounds bizarre. But it works OK! One of the tracks was "Keeping your poop in a jar." It's a song about this guy who's girlfriend dumped him, and all that he had left to remind himself of her was a jar of ........ well you know the rest. Del said "We've got to do this one on stage." Stunned silence. "Come on it'll be great."    We already push the boundaries of bad taste and decency when we play Kevin Bloody Wilson songs on stage. "Do you fuck on first date?" and "Don't touch you sister she's mine." and "It was over before it began." But I might draw the line at "Keeping your poop in a Jar".  Tonight we play the Wheatsheaf for the charity family fun day and tomorrow we do the music festival in Folkesworth.  So busy busy busy.  Here's a bit of useless information for you.  If something happens only once in a blue moon then today is that day.  Today is the blue moon day.  Not because the moon is blue but because we have a full moon twice in one calendar month. The next time it happens will be in 2007.  My boy Jamie has a new organ. It's enormous.  It's the biggest one I've ever seen. He's very pleased with it as you can imagine, and plays with it all the time. He used to have a smaller one which was OK, but this new one is amazing. His mother has a friend who collects organs of a particular type and in conversation discovered that Jamies old organ was a missing piece of his collection. He had to have it, so he did a trade. Jamies old organ for this new huge organ.  It's like a wurlitzer organ with hundreds of buttons and knobs and dials, two keyboards and fills the entire sitting room.  Just had a mother with a little girl come in. The little girl who was about 4 years old said "Guess where we're going next?" I couldn't guess. "We're going to buy a new cat and a new dog and a new baby."  "Where do you buy babies?" I asked  "At the borning house of course, that's where daddies new girl friend is. She's choosing one right now. It must be hard to choose your new baby because you  have to lie down in beds afterwards.  It better to choose a new puppy or kitten even I don't get tired after that."

      I received an Email tonight from a very old friend.&nbsp; I don't mean he's very old, but that I've known him a long time. He gave me a brief synopsis of his life since last time we talked. Fell in love with another woman, marriage in crisis, other woman dumped him, now other woman is best friends with wife.&nbsp; How complex can that be?  My very old friend and I knew each other at school. We formed what we called the Athiest prayer group. It was a bit of a piss take of the Christians amongst us who were so devout, so intense, that they had to be brought down a peg or two.&nbsp; The holier than thou brigade. The guys who said "We are Christians in a Christian school so we are better than you." Bollocks!!!!!! One day in my shop a woman came in to pick up her vacuum cleaner that we'd repaired. She was a devout Christian. She went to church every Sunday and was a member of the church council. As she took out her credit card I saw a Donor card. I innocently&nbsp; said "OH you've got a donor card. I've got one too." "Yes but I have a rider on mine." "What's that?" I ask in all innocence. "It's to make sure that if I die that my organs are not given to any muslims or anyone who isn't Christian." "That's not very Christian." I said laughing. But she was serious, and she launched into a tirade of abuse about those damned heathens. I've got to tell you I was shocked.  You may have already guessed that I don't give a shit about religion, any religion. But if I die I don't give a tinkers cuss who gets my body parts. If someone can benefit from my untimely death then it's got to be a good thing. My attitude to this customer, a white british female, took a dive. I was ashamed to be part of her world.  OK I don't believe in God or such like. But I do believe that what goes round comes round.&nbsp; if you are bad then bad things come to you. If you are good then good things come to you. If you smile to someone and make them happy then they will smile at the next person and make them happy in turn and so it goes on until it gets back to you. I have noticed that there are some&nbsp;days in the shop when almost everyone who comes in is in a bad mood. I've often wondered if that isn't something to do with atmospheric pressure. Or something that can be quantified. I've yet to figure it out. This is the scientist in me. I am a trained, but lapsed, scientist. A degree in Biology doesn't get you anywhere.&nbsp; I'd love to finish on a funny note. But I don't feel funny right now.&nbsp; Writing about this has made me want to just shut the fuck up and go to bed.

      A local publican came to the shop today to see me.  "Hey Mike do you want to come to a barbecue I'm having.&nbsp; I'm holding it on the roof of the pub and I'm inviting a select group of friends, so what are you doing on the 14th August.&nbsp; You can bring your other half. Oh yes Del and Tony and there wives are invited too. Bring your guitars we'll have a bit of music a laugh and some good grub." "So you want my band to come to your barbecue?" "Yeah as mates, you know." Cheeky sod! What he wants is for us to play for nothing all night and entertain his friends for him.  Anyway I had a look at our on-line diary and found........... "Sorry mate we're playing&nbsp; at The Swiss Cottage that night.&nbsp; I'd have loved to have come."  Which is actually true. I really would have loved to play at his barbecue, even for nothing. But I know Tony and Del would not be so enthusiastic, for different reasons. Tony because he is a self confessed mercenary and Del because he is hard up for cash and would prefer to work for a wage rather than a beef burger. That's not to say we don't ever play for nothing. We often do. I've lost count of the charity events we've played at. But even that isn't totally altruistic because doing favours for people has got us a fair bit of lucrative work.&nbsp; This weekends music festival for one. We played for nothing as a favour one day and so now it's payback time the organiser is charging £5 a head entrance and ticket sales have been very good so we're going to get a generous pay off this time.&nbsp; Especially as we're the headline act.  Just had a call from a musician friend&nbsp; of mine who is a drummer. But he also plays keyboard.&nbsp; He's converting some of his house into a recording studio.&nbsp; His partner is a nationally famous clairvoyant working all round the country playing town halls and the like giving demonstrations of her uncanny powers.&nbsp; He's going to be producing CD's of mood music and meditation music for her.&nbsp; Needless to say I offered my services.&nbsp; But somehow a chunky mandolin sound wont really work when someone is trying out self hypnosis.&nbsp; Maybe we could fit in the gentle guitar stylings of Mike Da Hat.&nbsp; GOD! Don't you just hate that phrase/ word "stylings".&nbsp; I first came across it when I was going to art galleries working for Martine Cotten my french Artist friend.&nbsp; Some French dude had a poster proclaining "the Artistic stylings of Jean Lagadec." But I suppose it's marginally better than having a&nbsp; poster saying "come and look at these pix what I jus' done." Another artist friend of mine David Holmes, God! I hope he doesn't read this, painted abstract pictures. I'd be walking past his gaff and he'd call me in. "Come and have a look in the studio Mike."  I'd go in and there'd be a load of canvasses all over the place on easels, leaning against the walls, on the floor and stacked in piles. To tease him I usually asked which were the ones that were finished.&nbsp; I never could make head or tail of any of them. One I remember well was a four foot by three canvas mounted vertically on which was painted three circles two blue and one yellow and then a huge rectangle of brown.&nbsp; I asked what it was supposed to be. "Isn't it obvious?" "No not really." "Well it's a birds eye view of a beach near St Ives in Cornwall. That blue circle represents the sky that one the sea and the yellow is the beach. Now do you see it?" "I guess so the big brown rectangle is the cliffs?" "Exactly I'll make an art lover of you yet." I don't think I ever actually told him they were rubbish. But the scary thing is he actually sold this stuff and made quite a good living at it. So someone must have liked it.&nbsp; Although I go by "The Emperors clothes" theory on art. If you're told often enough that something is good you'll end up believing it. Although personally I usually end up taking the part of the stupid boy in that story.&nbsp; I don't care how often I'm told something is good if it's crap it stays crap in my eyes.&nbsp; Here endeth Mike Da Hats master class on art appreciation

      Seems Mrs Dakin is going to be late.&nbsp; She isn't arriving til Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp; So Pete the grave digger has had to temporarily board up the grave and put concrete slabs over the hole. I shall be leaning out my window tonight watching for&nbsp; grave robbers and body snatchers.   Cambs constabulary has got this great system where they E-mail a load of people on their network about what's going on. Today it worked. I heard the "You've got mail" message on the PC. Had a look and it was a news flash from crime central. A car had been stolen just two minutes ago. We all got a description and told to look out for car.  Half an hour later "you've got mail" another message thanking everybody for their help and with everyones co-operation the bad boy was caught in possession of £80 worth of stolen meat from a&nbsp; supermarket and with the car. The boy was in custody pending further investigations.   The scruffy undercover man from todays earlier posting is in fact a friend of the flower girl next door.&nbsp; She told me he would have been &nbsp;the least likely person to end up in the police force.&nbsp; A bit of a rogue in his youth. She's known him and drank with him on many occassions.&nbsp; I said it takes a rogue to catch a rogue.   Smashy has arrived we're going ot have another go at this recording studio software.

      Comment from customer just now regarding Hawaian shirt. "Could you speak up a bit sonny, your shirt is a bit loud." PC Jamie was outside earlier arresting some young yobbo who&nbsp; looked sullen and surly, a bit of a curl to the lips and had the sneer.&nbsp; But PC Jamie isn't one to be messed with. The yob could sneer as much as he liked, but a few minutes against the wall&nbsp;surrounding our car park,&nbsp; sort of calmed him down a tad.&nbsp; They all start off with a bit of fight in them, y'know the old total lack of respect and total disdain for the law. Then after a few minutes of been questioned in the street. Or in this case in my car park, with everybody crowding round to watch the collar, they start to look a bit sheepish and start shuffling their feet and being uncomfortable. They kick at little stones on the ground. And stand their staring intently at something on the ground while PC Jamie is on his two way checking name and address details and form. Eventually the van turns up and&nbsp;the yob is put inside&nbsp;and made to wait some more. When the van had gone PC Jamie came up to me. "What's he done?" I ask. "You know I can't tell you that." says PC Jamie "Tell me what?" "Tell you that he was caught shop lifting in Boots." "You didn't." "That's right.&nbsp; So don't ask me again." "And he made it all the way here." "Oh he was followed by my colleague over there." he points to a tramp like figure with a baseball cap leaning on a wall across the road. "No! I thought you were going to arrest him as well." "No he's undercover that's why he looks like shit. Mind you there's room in the van for one more. It must be illegal to go out wearing a shirt like that. If I check my regs I think we can have you on being a public nuisance and &nbsp;being a menace on a public highway." he laughed and wandered off. To chase more bad guys presumably.  Meanwhile Mr Dakin has been exposed to the world for the first time since 1988, well his coffin has anyway. Solid oak.&nbsp; Quality stuff. Still looks good as new.&nbsp; He's just waiting for Mrs Dakin now, she's late, and they can't leave him exposed all night. There's no telling what the crazy people will do. We have enough of them around here.  We have Wurzel for instance. He is delusional, completely convinced that THEY are out to get him. Unfortunately he's never put his finger on exactly who THEY are.&nbsp; Anjim at the&nbsp; corner shop habitually tells him that he's being watched and certain people have been asking about him. Thus adding fuel to his already rampant paranoia.&nbsp; Late at night he can be seen in the street sometimes dressed in a long ladies evening gown and sometimes in pyjamas but always with a baseball cap on. Occassionally he can be seen hugging lamp posts and rubbing his body up and down it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation is that he is getting energy from the lamp post through the friction of his body.&nbsp; Much&nbsp;in the way &nbsp;you can impart static electricity into a balloon by rubbing it on your pullover.&nbsp; Well that's what he says anyway he's revitalising his inner electricity by tapping into the council mains supply for free.   Better do some work I guess.&nbsp; More later

      Here's todays exciting news.&nbsp; Pete the grave digger is in the graveyard opposite, digging up Mr Dakin. Apparently they're making room for Mrs Dakin.&nbsp; According to Pete, the records show that Mr Dakin is only three foot under, so they have to raise him from his slumbers, and dig another three foot deeper, so he'll then be&nbsp;six foot under. Mrs Dakin can then take her proper place in death, as in life, on top.   In an effort to celebrate what we laughingly call summer this year, in my shop I am sporting that lovely, but very loud hawaian shirt. It's blue and white with red bits on it. I've already drawn a few comments from passers by as I unlocked our boutique.&nbsp; Good job I don't work for John Lewis, I'd be sent home.&nbsp; Actually I'd have been sacked years ago. My ex loves to point out to me that "You're not all there are you Mikel? You should think seriously about getting some proffessional help." Yeah right!

      I've got to tell you this. It wasn't a wind up. There really is in the US of A a company that bottles dog water. It's called the K9 water comany. They have four flavours.&nbsp; Beef, Chicken, Liver and .... shit I can't remember the 4Th.&nbsp; It's fortified with vitamins essential for your dogs well being.&nbsp; The 4 flavours are called puddle water, gutter water, hose water and .... shit! I can't remember the 4th.&nbsp; I tried to download the pictures from their website for you but it didn't work. Oh well you'd better look for yourself if you don't believe me.   &nbsp;I never made it to my mates gig at The Cock Inn. My lift was working late that night and I never drink and drive.&nbsp; So sorry guys. My licence is worth more than my support. I ended up seeing locally, walking distance, The Untamed.&nbsp; "Prepare yourself for stadium rock" was their catch&nbsp; phrase.&nbsp; Well in this small &nbsp;pub they had a stack of speakers eight foot high by four foot wide each side of the stage and the same again back of the stage. A bit of over kill I thought. The lead singer was tiny about four foot nothing in his stockinged feet. When they put on the smoke effect the whole pub was filled and no one could see any thing.&nbsp; People were rushing out of the door with Asthma attacks reaching for their becotide inhalers. But they brought rent a crowd, all dressed up in leather, heavy rock gear, despite the heat.   Sunday was my pubs annual music fest in aid of a charity for the mentally challenged. God I hate this politically correct speak. Well it was a great day. We drank copious amounts of falling down water, bought raffle tickets and very loud shirts.&nbsp; So guess what I'm wearing for this saturdays gig at the Wheatsheaf? Yep A very loud Hawiain shirt with "Fosters" all over it.&nbsp; I tried it on tonight. The girls at the pub said I looked cute in it. I'm still not sure if they were taking the piss or what.  Tonight I had a house full of friends. You see I've got this new soft ware on my PC for recording music. It's a twenty four track recording studio.&nbsp; With bolt ons it costs one and a half grand. The only problem is it's so professional, so complex, no one could figure out how to work it. Needless to say I didn't pay one and a half grand to acquire this amazing piece of soft ware. I wont go into details but it cost me zip. But with a whole team of computer experts on the case, we haven't got anywhere with it. So my new solo CD&nbsp; is still on the back burner.&nbsp; IN case you're wondering I left the team upstairs while I struggled with AOL. Occassionally they called me upstairs thinking they'd made a break through, for me to play some guitar. But it still didn't work so I spent the next few hour listening to my mates upstairs, &nbsp;who can't play guitar, playing very odd chords here and there trying to create some music on the system.&nbsp; Eventually they got pissed off and went home so&nbsp;I went to the pub to play pool. Played seven lost one.   I made this box. It's a music computer data interface box.&nbsp; So I can plug my microphone and guitars into it and from there into my computer for recording. It cost me about £11 for the bits. Paul Smashy had it apart and spent an hour rewiring it with my soldering iron. Despite me telling him that it was OK. It still doesn't work. Danny reset the volume controls on my PC and Brian sat there drinking my coffee making useful comments like "Are you sure you know what you're doing?" Well no shit Sherlock! Of course we don't know what we';re doing because we don't have the manual because we haven't actually paid for the software. And Jenny sat there saying "Don't look at me. I'm just a driver for Sainsburies home deliveries." Smashy made a really good attempt at making us think he knew what he was doing by opening and shutting windows at a remarkable rate. But the bloody thing still doesn't work. &nbsp;Although I have made a recording of "Oh Lord wont you buy me a mercedes benz, my friends all drive Porsches and I must make amends, I worked hard all my life with no help from my friends, oh lord wont you buy me a Mercedes Benz." I'm sure it sounds better hear than on the recording. That was Janis Joplin if you must know.  So now the night is getting late. We've had the obligatory fight outside the fried chicken takeaway. Staff and customers spilt out onto the street.. I've fixed my floodlights outside the back door so maybe we'll get some more interesting video footage.&nbsp; The roof man came to fix the bathroom roof. He was a long time doing it. Then later he told me he was scared of heights.&nbsp; WHAT? So I had to go up on the roof to put the final touches to his good work while he recomposed himself at ground level. I think he must be in the wrong job. Well I thought that until he gave me the bill. Shit! I'd go up ladders for that amount.&nbsp; Just tell me what to do and I'll bleedin well do it myself.&nbsp; I think I'll buy one of those surfers T-shirts that say "No Fear", or "If it don't scare you, it aint worth doing!" Bring it on.  Rock on dudes and may your God be with you

      A customer came in earlier today with a large black dog, which sported a triangular yellow neckerchief. She picked up my coffee mug and said “Can I use this to give my dog some water?” “That’s my coffee cup.” “Sorry. What about this one?” she said pointing to Brians mug. “That’s a coffee cup too.&nbsp; Would you like me to fetch a bowl of water for your dog.” “No just the bowl would be lovely I have the water already.” And she holds out a bottle of Volvic. “You’re giving you dog Volvic?” “Yes of course he loves it.” she insisted “In this heat a dog will drink anything, even from a muddy puddle.” “Not my dog. He only has the best.” and she pats the dog who is panting heavily. “So why not Perrier?” I ask. “Oh he doesn’t like the bubbles.”&nbsp; Hmmm. Makes sense So I got the bowl and she filled it with Volvic mineral water, totally convinced that the dog loved it. The dog had a&nbsp; little then walked away, finally slumping in a cool corner of the shop. “I’ll throw the rest over his head.” Says the girl. “What?” “Oh I’ll wait ‘til I get the dog outside of course.” So she calls the dog over and takes it outside. “Sit!” The dog sat. And she pours the bowl of water over the dogs head.  I saw the dog looking just a little surprised at this and it looked at her sideways like as if to say “What the fuck was that all about? How would you like it?”  She went and the next customer came in and commented on the water all over the floor. “That’ll be the girl giving her dog mineral water. Can you believe it?” I said. “Actually yes! I’ve just got back from the USA and Dog Water is a big thing there. Special bottled water just for dogs.” “You’re kidding.” “No it’s true. They’ve just started to introduce it into this country.”  So I guess now all the dog owners will be training their dogs to open screw top bottles instead of lifting the toilet seat for a drink. And that begs the question what’s the&nbsp; difference between water and dog water. OK if we start with our basic H2O. Whats added? Or do we start by lifting the toilet seat and dipping the bottles destined for the doggy supermarket into the bowl.  I phoned a friend who is an animal lover and mentioned it. She said “Actually it’s cats that mostly drink from the toilet. Dogs don’t usually have the sense. They’ll drink anything. A cat knows the toilet water is “nice”, a dog doesn’t care.” Me I don’t own a dog and I don’t have a cat that owns me. So I’m not an expert in this field. I just tell it as I find it. So any comments would be welcome.&nbsp; Is this a wind up or is this life gone crazy?  &nbsp;

      Got a call yesterday from Mike Stewart, he’s a professional musician, unlike me, semi professional, which means I don’t give up the day job. He was in a panic. Big show that night, and his stage lights had failed. So 5:30 I dashed over to the venue in my car and after unloading a ton of equipment from the back of his transit, speakers, amplifiers etc I set about stripping the lights apart to find the faults. Got them all working in 45 minutes flat. Not bad.  Came back home had dinner and went back to venue with friends. Mike and his band were doing their “Rockology” show which is great, and very different. It is an anthology of rock music which&nbsp; features audio&nbsp; visuals on a big screen. It’s all computer controlled as are the lights and the backing tracks. Featured songs are from Led Zeppelin, Gary Moore, Carlos Santana, Eric Clapton, Free, Black Sabbath,&nbsp; Lynerd Skynerd, Deep Purple and lots more. It’s a great show and Mike is a great guitarist.  Standing behind me was this young girl with long brown hair and glasses with a crop top and jeans. She was dancing in front of what I thought was her boyfriend, very seductively even to the point of sucking her finger in front of him in a very suggestive manner. I say he was what I thought her boyfriend because ten minutes later he’s playing tonsil hockey with another girl. Meanwhile glasses girl was in the middle of the floor doing a solo turn much to the delight of various guys clutching pints of lager with both hands for fear of spilling anything in their excitement. Leather skirt girl, had been sidling up to Mark the drummer and managed to blag a pair of drum sticks from him. She went back to her table and proceeded to drum along with the band, before she too joined glasses girl in the middle, shaking her booty. Fat girl decided to join in.&nbsp; At which the various guys turned their attention back to the band and relaxed grips on pints of lager.  At the bar some teenagers were ordering drinks. Three thimble full shots of something blue. Six Quid!!!! They were downed in one hit. Then they decided to have another and queued for another ten minutes. Haven’t they learnt yet to double or even treble up on orders if a pub is busy?&nbsp; Obviously they’ve never been to a festival. The youth of today. You are young grass hoppers you will learn.  Trevor phoned me. He’s in the band "Hooker" a heavy rock band. Excited? I should co-co. He’s just got a new PA system for his band. 3kw of amplification and quote “Fuck off bass bins…… it’s the dogs bollocks, come and listen tonight we’re playing The Cock Inn.” So that’s&nbsp; what I’m doing tonight. Although 3kw pPA system for a small pub does seem a bit of overkill.&nbsp; But it makes a change for me. Normally I don’t get to see my friends play because I’m usually playing myself. But this weekend we’ve got a clear diary. Next weekend though, we’re playing a charity fun day on Saturday and a music festival on Sunday. We’re the headline act. Whoopee!! Last time I went to The Cock Inn, a young lady was intent on exposing herself to the band and by way of her ample size, to everyone else as well. My friend always seemed to be looking the other way when she did it. And I spent the whole evening saying “She’s done it again. Did you see this time?” He was convinced I was pulling his leg until he noticed the drummer was wearing the girls bra over his head like a pair of ear muffs and tied under his chin and the girl who had leant over the wooden barrier a little too far had toppled over and was hanging upside down with her boobs round her face screaming for help. There was a rush to help her. It’s a wonderful life.  Keep the faith. Mikel

      I wont say I live in a rough area but to give you a clue I have 1/2" steel bars on every downstairs window of my place. I also have 3/8" steel plate covering my back door secured by a 4" Chubb "invincible" padlock. The police know our area like the back of their hands and regularly can be seen (and heard)&nbsp; arriving at great speed, lights flashing and sirens blaring.&nbsp; Followed quite often by ambulances. I also have a video security camera linked to my TV and a very friendly message to the bad boys painted onto my back door. It says "Smile for the camera." But that doesn't stop various couples giving me a free porn show at my back door, which is not visible from the main road. And as I habitually sit in the dark writing this crap. With only the light of the monitor. No one even suspects I'm here.&nbsp; So I'm treated to grunts and groans and moans and "Give it to me big boy" not 6 feet from where I'm sitting.&nbsp; I usually wait til the critical moment and turn on the flood lights. Cruel aren't I? Now you may think it must be aweful to live here. Well don't. It may be a lot of things but&nbsp;it aint boring. I love it. Never a dull moment.&nbsp; Even as I write this the police have sped past to the estate behind me.&nbsp; The police helicopter is overhead, searchlight piercing through the darkness. It reminds me of "Apocalypse now". Except even Charlie Sheen wouldn't be seen dead here.&nbsp; I habitually stay up late. There's no point going to bed early. There's too much noise outside. People screaming &nbsp;at each other, fights going on.&nbsp; Drunks falling about and singing. Girls in tears because their psychopathic boyfriends have ditched them.&nbsp; Sitting slumped on the pavement opposite, their stockings in a mess and mascara all down their faces The boyfriend with more testosterone than he can handle is is itching to land one on her.&nbsp; Sometimes he does. But he's torn between been desperate for&nbsp;the &nbsp;shag that he's incapable of, and wanting to hit someone very hard. I can see him fidgiting in the street.&nbsp; All tensed up, stressed out, somethings gonna give, very soon. The girl is crying. He is frustrated. He hasn't the mental capacity to know why she's crying, all he knows is that it's fucking annoying him. He's done everything tonight, he's bought her drinks, got her pissed, and now she's crying. What the fuck is going on? A mate turns up. The boy's so wired up he wants to hit him but the mate is laughing and joshing with him. "Come on ditch the bitch. She's not worth it." "But I love her." comes the plaintive cry.&nbsp; Love? Two seconds ago he wanted to punch her lights out. "go on just talk to her then." So the boy goes to the girl slumped against the wall of the grave yard opposite my place. "Come on love. Let's go home." "You bastard! I've had enough. I can't&nbsp; take anymore." He's &nbsp;still trying to be nice. "Come on you can't stay there all night you'll die of cold. Let's go home." "Leave me alone you bastard. I can't do this anymore." "Think of the baby?" he tries. "You think the baby is yours?" I'm not sure she means that. But it has the appropriate response. "You fucking bitch." And the mate is holding him back while he tries to kick the girl on the&nbsp;pavement. She screams some more. The police arrive. Him and his mate walk nonchalantly off up the road. They don't even know her. By the time she's stopped crying they're long gone.  "Where do you live love?" "Just up the road. I'll be alright." A four by four screeches to a halt. "It's OK officer that's my daughter in law.I'll take her home." "OK."&nbsp; They bundle her into the trooper and speed off up the road.  All is quiet and finally I can get to sleep.  Goodnight!

      Can you believe it? It’s bleedin’ well raining again. The roof man came today and fixed my kitchen roof, but it started raining, so he fucked off. Leaving me, still with a hole in the roof above my bathroom.  “What about my bathroom roof?”  “I’ll come back &nbsp;when it’s not raining.”  “But it doesn’t leak when it’s not raining.”  So the buckets have to come out again. At least I can put away the bucket in the kitchen now. What happened to summer? Did I oversleep and miss it all? Apparently it was very nice one Sunday morning but that was probably the Sunday morning I had an enforced lie in due to exhaustion.  All this brings back memories of when I lived in Cyprus. All summer it would never rain then toward the end the small showers would start and we’d all run out into the street, arms outstretched,&nbsp; faces pointing upwards, welcoming the rain. Which incidently, was warm. In fact during those days at the end of summer when it rained it was so hot that our faces would get wet and the heat from the ground evaporated the rain before it hit our feet. Weird. Then later on in the year, the heavy rain would start, with the rain drops big as dobbers, bouncing two foot off the road. Soaking us to our skin. Not that we wore much in the way of clothing. khaki t-shirts and khaki shorts and open top sandals, no socks. We were dry again in ten minutes after the rain stopped.  I was once visiting my sister in Kingston Jamaica. She had a swimming pool that everyone in their compound used. Every morning we’d wake up, the sky would be blue and the sun shone. By 10:00am it started clouding over, by 11:00am it was full cloud, then at midday it just chucked it down. I was in the swimming pool and it started raining. Everyone in the pool except me jumped out the water and ran to get their towels, hid under them and ran for cover. What the fuck was that all about? If you’re already in the pool you can’t get any wetter. OK if there was a thunderstorm to go with it I might make an exception. But there never was. Then it would stop raining and for the rest of the day it was beautiful again. Spookily enough on the north coast of Jamaica they didn’t seem to have the same daily weather pattern of midday rain. So guess where all the tourist resorts are?  I used to take to walking alone through Kingston. Went to see Bob Marley at Tough Gong Studios, But he was out. The studio is easily missed it’s just a bungalow in a row of bungalows. One day I asked a taxi driver to take me to Trench Town. A place spoken of frequently in Bob Marleys lyrics and I wanted to have a look.  The taxi driver almost had a coronary. “White boy don’ wan go dat place. Is bad fo’ white boy.”  “Just a quick look? I’ll stay in the taxi.”  “No I don’ take no white boy to Trench Town. I take white boy to museum irie?”  “Irie.”  So in a cloud of dust, the taxi lurched forward, throwing me back into my seat at the back. We sped off across town. The wheels screeched around every corner. Apparently they are so keen on American gangster shows that they deliberately run their tyres on very low pressure so they screech round the gentlest of corners. Fuck aweful handling but then this is Jamaica. We stopped at the museum and the driver got out the car to open my door. He had only one leg. It wasn’t an automatic. It was a stick shift. He used his crutch to operate the accelerator pedal. I wasn’t going in that taxi again. So I nipped into the museum and after a quick look round, high tailed out the back door and found a bus. I got on. I was the only white face on the bus and it all went disturbingly quiet. Eeeek! A big fat woman with a brightly coloured turban poked me in the ribs.  “Hey you whitey! What you doin’ boy?”  “Taking the bus back into Kingston. What you doin’ girl.”  She laughed out loud. “White boy don’ take no bus. What you &nbsp;really doin’?”  “Well I am a white boy and I am on this bus, going to Kingston.”  Before I knew it everyone was asking me questions and being incredibly friendly.  I guess I must have been one of the first white boys they ever saw on the bus. They seemed to enjoy the fact as well. I&nbsp; got up to get off the bus in Kingston central and the fat turbaned lady poked me again. “Hey White boy! You can ride MY bus any day you want.” And she looked round to the other passengers and laughed wickedly. They all laughed as well. I just felt myself going bright red. “anytime white boy!” and she laughed again.  Back on the streets I was stopped by a Rastafarian “You wan’ buy bag?”  “No thanks.”  “Twenty five dollar.”  “Best smoke on the island. Only twenty five dollar.” He showed me the bag. It was almost the size of half a standard carrier bag. Packed full of grass/weed/ganja, whatever you want to call it. There was enough to keep the whole of my university stoned for a week. I walked on. Time for a beer. I stepped into the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel, into the bar, ordered a Red Stripe and picked up the Daily Gleaner. Really there is a paper called the Daily Gleaner. Also it has on the back page the British Daily Telegraph crossword from a month ago. Hmmm! At the time I was an avid crossword fanatic. So I bought a copy and took it back to the house. My brother in law, who fancies himself as a bit of a genius at crosswords had a go and got stuck.  “Can’t do it Phil? Sling it here I’ll help you out.”  It was just like filling in the blanks as I already knew all the answers from a month ago. I made a point of making comments like “Christ Phil didn’t you get this one?”  And “How did you miss that one?” To this day I have never let on about it to him.  &nbsp;  Hmm! It’s stopped raining.&nbsp;

      Bizarre incident of the day. I had a knock at my back door. This guy stood there in a bright orange fleece and baggy trousers and dragging a blanket behind him. He said "Excuse me mate have you a piece of cardboard I could lie on?" I gave him a large cardboard box he thanked me and wandered off across the road to the cemetary. The gate was locked so he threw his carrier bags and the card board box over the gate and climbed over.  He was last seen making a nest for himself behind a gravestone. I hope he has a peaceful night.

      I’ve changed the name of the blog again. I don’t mention vacuum cleaners that much, so it seems to be 1. A blessing and 2. More relevant. After all I don’t stand on stage with a Dyson slung over my shoulder.  Went to the music shop to pick up an XLR socket. That’s a socket that I can plug my microphone into.&nbsp; Rick said “That’s £2.50.”  “What?&nbsp; They’re only 26p in my catalogue.”  “Impossible. Tell you what, you have this one and fuck off!”  “I must pay you.”  “No need. Fuck off!”  “Thanks Rick.”  “Anytime. By the way I’ll do you a really good deal on an Ovation guitar.”  “How good a deal?”  “A really good deal. I’ll look after you.”  “What if I want to chop in my 6 string electric acoustic?”  “I’ll do you a good deal on that too.”  &nbsp;  Our new website has music on it. It’s us playing the first few bars of “Stuck in the middle with you.” It’s looped to drive you crazy. You can sing along. There’s a picture of me there with baby. (That’s what we call my mandolin.) Pix of Del and Tony too so you’ll know who I’m talking about.  &nbsp;  I used to work security at a rock club in Aylesbury. I say security with a laugh, because I was an eight stone weakling at the time. Now I’m a thirteen stone weakling.  The club was the famous “Friars Aylesbury”. One night I was stage left, watching Iggy and the Stooges. Iggy Pop was stripped to the waist leaping about the stage, when this guy came up to me in the darkness.  “Alright?” he said to me, standing at the bottom of the stage steps.  “Yeah great!” I said.  “Good group huh?”  “Yeah Great!”  “Well that’s my cue.” He said, “Love to stop and chat but I’ve got to go on stage.”  He walked up the steps and sat behind a keyboard, the lights went on and it was bleedin David Bowie. Fuck I’d been standing next to David Bowie and all I’d managed to say was “Yeah Great!”  I met quite a few famous artists over the years the ones that stick out in my mind, stick out for the strangest reason. Rick Wakeman and Steve Harley both &nbsp;in the bar before the doors opened. They were a lot shorter than I expected. I still wonder why I remember them more than any of the others, perhaps it was simply because I was a lot taller than them.  I hada&nbsp; great arrangement with this girl called Sue. Her father would drive From Stoke Mandeville to Wendover to pick me up and then drive the two of us to Friars. In return for this kindness I got Sue in for free every week as my guest. We’d sit and chat before the doors opened and she’d have great fun waving to her mates stuck outside in the cold and the rain. She’d even buy me drinks during the night and bring them to me where ever I was stationed at the time. Then at the end of the night her father would drive me the six miles home. It was perfect. Sue herself was gorgeous. But being very shy in them days (really) I didn’t dare make a move in case she got upset and I lost my free transport. Years later I was in Aylesbury and met a guy who asked me what ever happened to Sue. &nbsp;I said I didn’t know.  “What? You were going out with her weren’t you? For years.”  “No. I never went out with Sue.”  “But she was with you all the time.”  “There was never anything going on.”  “That’s not what she was telling everyone else.”  So it appears everyone knew about me and Sue, except me. So this is another testament to that stuff at the top of this blog. I never had a mispent youth. Damn my shyness. Damn it to hell and back. The good news is I have cured myself of that. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  We’re doing “Local boy in the photograph” by the Stereophonics. So I’d better pick up the old guitar and practice a bit. Later dudes.

      I've been to my pub to play pool tonight. A couple of travellers were there. How come they play pool so well? They were devastating against all comers. They have this look. A look that sees right through you. Then they thrash the arse off of you. Later on a couple of lads turned up, they were&nbsp;both deaf and dumb. &nbsp;They were Ok. They both played well. And I'm sitting there having my drink wanting to go home because I am old and past it. And I get another drink put in front of me. Then another. Who's buying these drinks? Shit! I just want to come home. But years of drinking training has taught me that you never refuse a drink. I think I'd better start being strict with myself. Perhaps I can refuse the odd drink.&nbsp; Even if I have to upset the donor. But it's not that easy. There's a free drink so take it. That moved me on to another thought about being a musician.&nbsp; I used to think&nbsp; musicians were Gods. They were what I aspired to.&nbsp; I used to sit in an audience and dream of doing what they did. But now I am the one one stage. I am the one playing the music. But I don't feel special.&nbsp; Don't get me&nbsp;wrong I love to be the one on stage.&nbsp;But I'm not special. I'm just like you. Because I play guitar, that&nbsp;doesn't make me better than you.&nbsp; I am now the person I wanted to be, the guy on stage. But I've found I admire so many people who don't play guitar like I do.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't matter that I can do what a lot of people can't. They can probably do something I can't. So I'm no better no worse&nbsp;.&nbsp; It's just that I have the privelige of doing something I love to do. And people scream and shout for more. Try doing that as a civil servant as a tax collector as a salesman. I'll never be famous but people see me in the street and say "Did I see you play at.........." You know that's a wonderful feeling. To have someone come up to you and say they have enjoyed the night. You've enjoyed it? What about me? I've had a great time. Entertaining you. It's been a privelige to be able to play guitar for you. I&nbsp; would do this job for nothing. But if I get paid?&nbsp; Holy shit! Years ago I used to play in a folk rock band.&nbsp; The leader of the band was so up his own arse that any mistake was a hienous crime. I was so paranoid about making a mistake that I got stage fright big time.&nbsp; Eventually I was so paranoid that I was feeling sick every time we went on stage. I was going to throw up. I used to sit on my guitar stool and clench my legs round the legs sp people wouldn't see me shaking. Eventually it got so bad I said "I can't do this any more." And I stopped playing live for fifteen years.&nbsp; Playing with my new band Ad Hock was a revelation to me.&nbsp; I was allowed to make mistakes. Del and Tony made loads themselves but no one noticed. They were not on my case when I fucked up. I just got the odd glance. But we carried on.The crowd loved us, mistakes and all.&nbsp; I can't believe how lucky I am to be playing music with two such great guys. We are not like your usual band. We never rehearse.&nbsp; If someone shouts out a song they want to hear we'll play it. One of us will know it. &nbsp;I love Del to death. He is always late. We have a joke in the band that we are running on normal time or Del Time. Tony is English but was raised in the USA. He speaks with a vague Irish accent but can't explain why. He is the driving force behind the group. He is brilliant when he works the crowd with his radio mike. Then there's the girls in our group.Tony's girl friend Debs cannot take her drink. She will be smashed on half a pint of lager. God! You'd love her. Del's wife Dianne is such a trooper. She is command of the situation at all times. Without Dianne, Del would be lost. But Del throws the most amazing parties. Get yourself invited to one.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we're just musicians. We are just like you. We aren't anything special. It's just that we've done something you lot couldn't be bothered to do.&nbsp; We are human just like you. We have the same problems you have. We fuck up just like you do. But at the end of the day, we are the ones on stage. Don't feel intimidated. We have our faults. &nbsp; May your God be with you. &nbsp; Mike Da Hat

      Call me cynical but if you remember I was complaining about AOL crashing on me every two minutes since they've been bombarding me with pleas for me to upgrade to broadband. I often wondered if it was a coincedence or some cynical ploy to get more money out of me.  Well finally I relented and signed up for broadband.  Guess what? Since I signed up AOL has not crashed on me once and I haven't even installed the hardware yet I'm still on dial up at the moment.&nbsp; I leave it to you to decide........ I personally have my suspicions.

      The band Saturday night was brilliant. A local band called Citizen Smiffy. Fronted by Colin Smith, who does a great impression of Sting, from “The Police”. So as you can imagine they do a fair few Police covcrs. There were a couple of surprise guest artists on stage. Giz Butt, who was the lead guitarist from The Prodigy, and now has another band whose name I don’t recall, and the drummer from The Damned and Morrissey. Both played brilliantly. Giz or Graham teaches guitar here in Peterborough, so if you’ve got a spare £20 a lesson, you too can be taught guitar by the great Giz Butt. No he didn’t ask me to plug his guitar school. It’s just that another friend of mine who also teaches guitar, was moaning that he can only get away with charging £14 a lesson.  “yeah but you aint Giz Butt.” I &nbsp;told him.  We’ve got a new website for my band. There’s not much on it right now. Some of the photo’s are loaded, not the blurb, just the titles. But for what it’s worth the link is on the right.  It’s a beautiful morning the sky is blue and all is quiet. It&nbsp; reminds me of when I used to live in Cyprus. First thing in the morning the sea was very calm. Hardly any waves just a gentle shushing on the pebbles of the beach. Our school didn’t have a swimming pool so early in the morning we’d all take a coach down to the beach for our swimming lessons.&nbsp; We’d all jump into the sea and start splashing about. No life guards, just the teacher walking up and down the beach watching us. I can’t imagine that happening now. All this health and safety regulations stuff.  Another thing that probably wouldn’t happen is the annual trip to the cliff edge to watch the Red Arrows.&nbsp; As you guessed we lived on the coast at RAF Episkopi. Every year the Red Arrows would come over and do a few practice shows so we’d all go to the cliff top and watch. Now this is a million times better than going to an air show. Because they’d come in from over the &nbsp;sea skimming the waves. So we’d be actually looking down on them, then they’d pull up sharply and zoom over our heads. They got quite close the sound was incredible. Kids would be screaming especially the younger ones. Great fun.  I noticed in the paper yesterday that yet another army recruit had died after a one and a half mile run. Hmmm yet another enquiry. &nbsp;OK I’m sorry for the guys family and friends and especially sorry for the guy himself having died so young. But this is life. This is the army, they have to train their people to be tough, fit, capable. The training has to be hard if it wasn’t there’d be no point. We might as well send in a platoon of hairdressers to knock out an enemy position. We are being protected too much. Protected to a ridiculous degree, where people are now automatically looking to blame someone else when something goes wrong, going straight to a lawyer for comensation because they’ve been daft enough to hurt themselves.  One of the most ridiculous things I’ve read in a long time was this guy in the USA who bought an RV he was driving down a long straight road and decided to make himself a coffee so he got out the driving seat and went to the back of the RV. Meanwhile the RV carried on down the road until it left the road and turned over a few times. &nbsp;It was a right off. The RV’s owner sued the company for not telling him that the vehicle would not drive it self. No where in the manual does it say that he mustn’t let the vehicle drive it self. Believe it or not he won his case.&nbsp; I bought a guitar lead no where in the instructions does it say I mustn’t wrap it round my neck or round the neck of anyone else in case they choked. So if I did could I sue the company who made the lead because they hadn’t told me that I shouldn’t in the instructions? It’s common sense. People are not allowed to have common sense anymore, they’re not expected to have it, because we have all these rules and regulations that protect us from our own stupidity. Eventually people will no longer be able to think for themselves. In Sainsburys I saw a packet of Peanuts. On it was written a warning “This product contains nuts” No shit!  Here’s another thing that pisses me off. “The customer is always right”. Well not in my shop they aint. Who the hell thought that one up? The customer is usually wrong. They start shouting to you about going to trading standards and getting a lawyer etc etc So you open the phone book and give them the number of the trading standards office and say “Off you go. Give them a call.” And they just stand there unable to say a word because they know they’re wrong and they know they were just try to pull a fast one on you. They know it, you know it but there’s always this “Customer is always right” thing that makes people believe they can get away with murder. I am very tolerant, very fair and I’ll bend over backward to put right something I know to be my fault. But I wont let customers take the piss. I don’t care how loudly they shout the customer is NOT always right.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Went to see a band last night. I can’t begin to describe how aweful they were. The lead singer, dressed in spray on leather trousers, sported a matching leather cap reminiscent of those leather caps favoured by our homosexual friends. She couldn’t sing. The band member with the most talent was wheeled on stage in his wheel chair. Now he was good. But as this was his first appearance with the band he hadn’t yet learnt all the songs.  Well we sat there listening to them destroy song after song, and watching the crowd disappear out the back door. No doubt Steve the landlord, next week, will try to tell me they were brilliant, and he’s definitely going to &nbsp;book them again. He seems to have an uncanny knack of &nbsp;talent spotting. If there’s a crap band to discover he’ll be the first to discover them and pay them good money to empty his pub for him. &nbsp;  I went to the bar. A friend came up to me “What do you think of the band?” he says swaying a little.  “You want my honest opinion?”  “Yes as a fellow musician.”  “Rubbish.”  “There you go.” and he turns to the guy standing next to him. “If he thinks it’s crap then they must be.”  “Well I think they’re great.”  “have you had new batteries in your hearing aid this week?”  My friends turns to me to shake my hand. “I’m pleased I’m not the only one to recognise sheer total incompetence. I’d rather watch my own Grandmother falling down the stairs, than watch this lot.”  I left very shortly after that. I had to cut my toe nails or something equally interesting.  Actually I got home and started practicing a song by Puddle of mud “Blurry” hit the first chord and thought “Hey that’s also the first chord of Nickelbacks “How you remind me”.” So I tried to work out the rest. Got half the song nailed. I’ll speak to Tony and see if he’s got the other half.  Just had an asian guy come in “You got butch?” he asks.  “What?”  “Butch, you got butch?”  “I can’t understand what you’re saying.”  “Butch for clinner.”  “Butch? Clinner?”  “I got in car I show you.”  “Great.”  He brought in a brush for his vacuum cleaner. “Oh you want a brush for your cleaner.”  “Swot I sed, butch for clinner.”  Gotta go I must lie down before I go to this wedding reception tonight. OH God! It’s another 3 piece suit event. And they won’t let me bring my guitar. “We’ve got the music covered.”they said. “We’ve a Spanish guitarist going to be playing.”  Hells teeth! I think I might be leaving early.

      I haven’t always been an electrician and musician and writer. The crazy thing is when I was young I had absolutely no interest in music. Even less interest in writing. All I wanted to do was be a scientist. So I became a biologist. Went to university etc, landed a job working for the government, watching lapwings on an airfield. Lasham if you must know, it’s in Hampshire. But I was paid a pittance £47 a week. Scandalous. My mate who I shared a house with said “Why don’t you work for me as a landscape gardener?” “How much will you pay me?” “£80 a week.” It was a done deal. Within three weeks that was upped to £100, because I became a worker /driver. Then three months later a job as foreman came up. The boss Bob went round the whole company asking everybody if they wanted to be the next foreman. There was me jumping up and down saying “Me Me Me! I’ll do it. I can be foreman.” “Fuck off Mikel! You’ve only been here three months what do you know about being foreman?” he walked away.  Everybody laughed at me. I was only twenty one.  So Bob asked Steve who had been in the building trade man and boy for the last thirty years. He refused. So he went to the next guy twenty years experience. Not interested. They didn’t want the responsibility. And I’m still shouting “Me Me Me!” Eventually Bob struck out no one was interested and he wandered back to his office. I turned to the guys and said “I’m gonna get that job.” They almost wet themselves laughing at me. But I went to the office anyway. Bob was sitting behind his desk. “Yes?” he said impatiently. “I want that job.” “Fuck off!” “no wait a minute here’s the deal.  You already pay me £100. As a foreman you’ll pay me £140. So you only have to find another £40. Now if you advertise that’s going to cost you. Then when you get your man you’re gonna have to pay him £140. So if you give me the job you save the money on advertising and the time and effort of interviewing and it’ll only cost you an extra £40 a week instead of £140 so in the year you’ll save over £5,000. Money you’d rather have in your own pocket I bet.” He sat silent for a while. I could tell he was going through the figures in his head. I went on. “If it doesn’t work out I’ll go back to what I was doing. And you’ll have lost nothing. But if I do the job which I know I can. Hey you’re on a winner.” He was softening. Eventually he leant back in his chair and said “I know I’m going to regret this but you’ve got the job.” “Thanks Bob I wont let you down.” I walked out of his office back into the yard and all the guys were there. I had my head held low and shuffled my feet a bit for maximum effect. They all started taking the piss and laughing at me. I just stood there and said “Right, you can call me Sir now.” Dead silence. “You got the fucking job?” “Believe it. I’m now your boss.” And I still didn’t know the first thing about being a landscape gardener.  It was the middle of winter and my first job was to lay a concrete path through the middle of a customers garden.  I had my team. Steve the guy who had worked in building man and boy for thirty years was working for me. “What do you reckon Steve?” “well it’s frosty so the concrete could crack in this cold, so we’d better use some Febspeed” “What’s that?” “It’s a plasticizer stops the cement cracking, makes it more pliable in cold conditions.” “Good thinking. What mix do we use?” “Oh five to one obviously. …. Hey! I’m not saying that. It’s not my decision.” “Of course not.” “I never said anything to you alright?” “What ever you want.” “Right then.” I turned to the rest of the team. “OK boys we’re going with a five to one mix and put a dab of Febspeed in it to stop the cracking. Let’s do it.” And so it went on. The next job I had to lay a patio at the back of this rich guys house. When we got there it’s was raining very hard and the patio area was a quagmire. We couldn’t work in those conditions. Steve wanted to go back to the yard to check with Bob but that was an hours drive away. Then an hours drive back. We didn’t have mobile phones in them days. I looked at the situation and  decided that it would be better to do next weeks work this week. That was build the concrete path down the hill leading to the patio. So I gave the order to start work. The guys were obviously worried about this because we were suppose to be laying a patio. “Bob will kill us if we don’t do what we’re supposed to do.” “But we can’t so we’d better do something useful.” “no we’ve got to go back to the yard.” “no I’m not wasting Bob’s money. We’re going to lay this path.” The customer was looking through his window at us and saw we’d started work other than what was on his schedule. He phoned Bob to complain.  Forty five minutes later I heard Bobs car screach to a halt outside the front of the house. The guys all had smug grins on their faces, knowing I was in for a pasting. Or even better the sack. Bob came round the back red faced and ready for an argument. “What the fuck is going on?” “See for yourself Bob. It’s a quagmire here. We can’t lay a patio on this it’ll sink as soon as it dries out.” “So why didn’t you check with me as to what to do next.” “Because Bob you are paying me to make decisions. So I made the decision. We’re laying the path first where it’s drier. That way, later we can use the path to get the materials to the patio easier. Rather than struggle through the mud. And also so we don’t waste all this money you pay us to do nothing.” Bob was desperate to bluster some more but he could see the sense of it. “I’ll go and speak to the customer. Explain what’s going on.” “Ok we’ll just get on with what we’re doing then?” After that I never had trouble with my team ever again. They respected my decisions.  I still didn’t have a clue about what I was doing. But I had logic and common sense on my side. And that’s what it’s all about. It doesn’t matter what you do as long as you have a fucking good excuse for doing it.  You can fuck up big style but if you have a good reason for doing what you have done then the world is your oyster.  When I was still at school I got a job as a refrigeration engineer for during the holidays. Mother didn’t like me sitting around moaning I was bored. One day we had to go to fix the fridge in a mortuary. We got there and it was this ramshackle building with a corrugated iron roof. The mortuary attendant showed us to the cooling unit and we got to work. After a while he asked us if we wanted a coffee or tea. Fred, the guy I worked for, said that would be great. The kettle was boiled cups prepared and and tea served. Then the mortuary attendant said to me “Fetch the milk boy. It’s in that drawer over there. Second on the left.” So I went to the drawer second on the left and pulled it open. Sitting in between a pair of toe tagged feet was a bottle of milk and a plastic bag of sandwhiches. Eeeek! I kept my cool. I wanted to be sick. But I knew it was a wind up. I wasn’t going to let him have the satisfaction of getting one over on me. So with my back to the attendant I said to the body  “Oh pass me that bottle of milk will you………Thanks awefully.” I didn’t have milk in my coffee.  My children are not normal children. I’ve already told you this. Tonight I was talking to my boy Jamie. The conversation was all about contract killers and their methods. We sat in the sitting room and he said “we need to carry on this conversation somewhere else to get a new perspective on it.” “Ok where do you want to go?” “To the pub.” That’s my boy. So we drove to the pub. And discussed how to kill people. Really, I kid you not. Jamie is the least violent boy you will ever meet. But in the interests of research for HIS stories he wanted to thrash out a few ideas. I hope  no one overheard us talking about how to kill people.  On the way home he asked me “How do you know all about killing people like that?” “I’ve looked into it for my own stories. Accuracy is the key. Research. It’s got to be believeable.” We even discussed making a Monty python quiz the first question was going to be What were the knights that said Ni formally known as? But that sort of fizzled out as we went on to other stuff. Gemmalah meanwhile was having a playstation night with her friends. My ex is in Scotland on a freebie holiday. I’m really pleased she told me the kids were going to be all by themselves this week. Not! Cause she didn’t tell me. Am I allowed irony here?   That’s it. May your god be with you.

      I just spent the last two hours writing the most incredibly funny blog and fucking AOL crashed on me. I may be a cynic but AOL used to be pretty good until they started bombarding me with messages asking me to go to broadband. From that moment AOL has crashed on me so many times I have lost count. Is this deliberate?   Are they deliberately making my service crap so I can not continue without paying them more for broadband? I'm not the only person to have noticed this. Is there a conspiracy? A hidden agenda. Am I becoming a member of the conspiracy theory set? I'm too tired to write it all again. So you'll have to imagine the funniest thing you've ever read. Post a comment. Tell me how funny this is. I'm going to bed. Before I fall head first into my waste bin. Sorry Zoe.  May your God be with you  Mikel

      Tonight is my slobbing night. I got really ill a few weeks ago because I was doing too much. Burning the candle at both ends and then in the middle. Thursday we played Geneva's and stayed til 03:00am next night I was up til 02:00 the next night we played the Fox at Folkesworth played until 02:30. Sunday I went to bed early and a friend phoned me at Midnight. Couldn't get back to sleep. So by Monday I was a zombie. So due to old age I have decided that at least one night a week I've got to ease up. OK it's a token gesture. My doctor will hate me for it. I daren't tell him about my real lifestyle he'd lock me up, for my own good. But I can't sit still. I've got to be doing something.  So tonight I've been playing guitar. Practicing a few things Tony wants to do in the band. We're playing a mini music festival on the 1st August. Our band is the headline act. There's going to be six bands throughout the afternoon. Well it's official Simon has sold his Lotus Esprit and bought a J200 guitar and Pete Townsends old guitar or was it John Entwhistles? A J200 for the uninitiated is the guitar of choice of Elvis. he wont tell me exactly what it cost but it was in four figures. Meanwhile Tony last night told me he was buying an Ovation guitar. You may have seen themthey are those guitasrs that have the rounded plastic backs. many years ago I was delivering a cooker to a guy and as I walked through his front room I noticed a fender stratocaster leaning against the sofa. "You play guitar? " I asked "No I just buy and sell them I'm selling this one for £80." "What? I'll buy it." "Sorry I've already sold it." "Have you any more?" "Not this second I had a crappy plastic backed one last week." "what sort?" "I dunno.It began with an O." "Ovation perhaps?" "yeah that's right. Fucking useless piece of shit. I got rid of it for £20. Who wants a plastic guitar?" Well me for one. The twat didn't know what he'd got. I almost died. £20  for an Ovation? I console myself now that they were probably stolen. Delivering cookers is an entertaining line of work. One day the DHSS asked me to deliver a cooker to an old man. I got to the house and knocked on the door. "Fuck off!" shouted this voice. "I've come to deliver a cooker." "Fuck off!" "The DHSS sent me." "Fuck off! Before I call the police." So I went to the kitchen window and looked in to show him my I.D. I was looking down the barrel of a second world war Luger. Shit! They don't pay me enough for this. Another time I was sent by the DHSS to deliver a cooker to a house and as I got there the "Meals on Wheels" guy was handing a dinner through the kitchen window. He turned to me and said "You're not going in there are you?" "Yes I've got to fit this new cooker." "Well wipe your feet on the way out then.I wouldn't go in there if they paid me double or even treble wages." I stood at the door and it was opened by this really scruffy guy. I was knocked back by the smell. The old guy said "the kitchens this way." and walked down an uncarpeted hallway.  "Shit!" he said. He'd trodden in something. Yep it was dog shit."'scuse me" he said as he opened a door and wiped his shoe on the carpet of his living room. I was almost gagging by now. I looked about me there was dog shit everywhere. The smell was incredible it crept into your clothes, your nose, everything.  "would you like a cup of tea?" "no thanks." I said, perhaps a little too quickly. I just wanted to get out and at that moment knew why the "meals on wheels" guy handed him the meal through his kitchen window. It was hell on earth. I had to drag the cooker throughthe living room. In the middle was a single tub washing machine. It was on a boil wash. The water was grey and fetid. The air was steamy and gut wrenching. God what was he boiling? Body parts? The kitchen was horrendous. Mould everywhere and bottles of rancid milk on the window sill. The floor cluttered with empty cartons and rubbish. Every surface was covered with a layer of filth and grease. The dogs sniffed around my legs. Two german shepherds who had never seen the light of day in years. Crapping and pissing where ever they stood. It was obvious that this guy  was never going to use this cooker at all. So why the hell was I here? Perhaps to provide him with another surface to cover with his filth. Perhaps so the DHSS could say they did their best. They've done their duty. How can people live like this? Until you've been there you will never know how fabulous fresh air is. Just to stand outside this house and breathe deeply, suck in that beautiful air.  Cleanse yourself. I had to change my clothes and have a shower after that job.  The DHSS has a lot to answer for. one time they sent me to deliver a cooke to this woman who was having a nervous breakdown. She lived in a second floor flat with no lift. I had to haul that cooker up thirteen stairs. At the top I encountered and empty flat. Absolutley nothing in it apart from a bed roll and a "Goblin teasmade". The woman was painfully thin and had black teeth. She asked me if I wanted a cup of tea. Standard question in this country. I said "OK" even though I didn't really want one. "I've got no milk." she said. "That's OK I have mine black anyway." "I've got no sugar either." "oh well perhaps I can do without." "I'm fresh out of tea as well." she said, "I can do a nice cup of hot water." "That's OK I'll do without." And I got on with fitting the cooker. Suddenly she slinked up to me and said "You've worked hard perhaps you'd like to lie down a while." And she lay down on her bed roll and patted it waiting for me to join her. Flashing her black teeth at me.  Eeeek! I said " this is a little more difficult than I thought I better get our other engineer onto the case." I ran out the flat.  Back at our shop I went to John and said "I've got an important job for you. You've got to fit a cooker. her's the address." John said "OK" and disappeared he was gone two hours. When he got back he came up to me and said "You bastard. You knew she was a nutter. She tried to rape me. She had me down on the floor and I had to fight her off. You'll pay for this." I must admit I had to laugh. But then that's what it's like being in the electrical trade.   May your god be with you  Mikel

      God I wish you guys reading this would leave a comment sometimes. I only to say "Hi"  I was sent a story which in itself is very funny but I'm sure it's an urban myth.  It's one of those stories "from the trade" this time from a computer help line. So, for what it's worth here's the story. Customer: Hello my computer doesn't work. Help line: OK in what way doesn't it work? Cust: It's completely dead my screan has gone blank. Help: Have you tried switching it off and then switching it back on again? Cust: Yes but nothing happened. Help: So there's no lights on the computer at all? Cust: no nothing. Help: then we'd better check the mains lead is plugged in properly at the back of your computer. Cust: OK where is it? Help: it's the cable that goes fromt he plug in your wall to the computer. Have a look at the back and make sure it hasn't come loose. Cust: I can't see it. Help: It's  right there at the back.  Cust: But I can't see it, it's too dark.  Help: Well turn on a light then. Cust: I can't there's a power cut.  As I said it's a great story but I'm sure it's an urban myth.So that won't make it into my book.  Or is it? If you've got better call me. You know where I am.  I've got to tell you to read "My boyfriend is a twat". It's a really great web site. The link is to the right of this. I laughed til I stopped. I haven't laughed so much since the cat died.  Zoe. I once had a girl friend called Zoe. She wont speak to me any more. Seems I did the most cardinal sin and dumped her. Even though she was the best thing that had ever happened to me at the time. But then I was young and stupid. The only difference is that now I am old and stupid. Most of the girls I speak to say the same thing. That it doesn't matter how old a boy gets, he's still a boy. I'd like to think that now I am my age I am more mature, more responsible, I have connected with my inner self and am more in tune with the world.But really I'm just a kid looking to have fun. My children read this so I perhaps I should say something more mature. Sorry kids, your dad is just like you. I do my best, but sometimes my best isn't good enough. I hope you understand.  We are all fallible. No one is perfect. And because of that I don't expect you to be perfect. All I ask is that you do your best. That's good enough for me. You'd love my kids. They're great. Bizarre admittedly. But great. Hey kids! Do you mind me calling you bizarre? I'm sure they'd be proud to be bizarre.  Given permission from the sproglets themselves I'll tell you more about them. But I have to check with them first. So until then it's   Hasta la vista   and all that  may your god be with you  Mikel

      I've got to tell you this. Last night I was sitting here in the dark, as is my norm,  and I heard a noise at my backdoor. So I got up and tried to openthe door there was a little resistance so I gave a big push. It was a young girl in leather trousers down round her ankles. There she was bum in the air on all fours after the push. She screamed a bit then burst into hysterical laughter pulled up her trousers and ran off down the road.With her boyfriend following her all tensed up ready for a fight shouting "what the fuck........?" This is what happens when you live on a busy main road that's half way between the night clubs and the housing estate. Yeah but cute bum or what? So it's not all bad. Before that my darling daughter had phoned me because she wanted a lift home from the "Busted" concert. So I got out the car and went to open the gate of our yard. Sitting on my door step were two young girls. Carrying "Busted" posters and "busted" flags. I thought they look familiar. It was Roz and Caz my neices. They have proper names of course. But their young society mean they have to lose their proper names and resort to these shortened versions. For years my brother in law has fought hard against this, insisting on calling them by their given names Rosalind and Caroline. But even he has given up now and calls them Roz and Caz. Gemma  was full of her self "Charly waved to me."  She gushed. Well I'm sure that's true. Fifty rows back and in a crowd of ten thousand. But she can have her dream. Now I mentioned before that my children are bizarre. Well Gemma true to form hasn't changed her name to be shorter like Gem or Juh, she's made her name longer. So now she's called Gemmalah. Apparently I'm called daddylah and her best friend June is now Junelah. Obviously my ex-wife is mummylah and my two sons are Jamielah and Joshlah. Jamielah is really James.But he hates the name so much he renamed himself Jamie virtually from the day he could speak. My wife changed her name from Victoria to Vikki. Although somtimes the change is from Vikki to Ex. as in "Hello Ex how you doing?" to which she will reply "Can't stop I'm off out." "Oh where're you going?" "Nowhere you need to know about." "I just wondered." And she skips off in her leather trousers and crop top jacket to a car parked strategically half a mile away from the house driven by Sales Rep guy or was it insurance salesman guy. I can never tell. Seems a nice guy though. But what do I know? He could be an axe murderer for all I know. Our gig diary is pretty empty right now. No gigs until August 1st. So if anyone wants to book a really entertaining band, we're available. Weddings and barmitzvas, birthday parties and pub gigs no problem.

       urlLink    This is the legendary hat. It's been digitally enhanced and stuff to take out the person wearing it, which at the time wasn't me but some young lady who tooka shine to it. Sometimes I think my hat is more famous than I am &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    My friend Smashy started off by just wanting a set of bongos. Then he got a stand for it.  Then a bolt on tambourine, a cow bell, a cymbal and that yellow thing in the middle which is actually made of plastic but sounds like a hollow wooden block. He tells me he's getting ready for his world tour. I'd better teach him some more guitar first before the tour bus arrives. We've been going over a couple of U2 songs recently. With or without you and All I want is you. He'll be kicking guitar butt soon.&nbsp; urlLink

      Another story from my friend who mans the Hotpoint customer help line. Cust: I've just taken delivery of my brand new Hotpoint washing machine. And it's bouncing around the kitchen. Help: Yes that may be because you haven't removed the transit bolts from the machine> Cust: Excuse me but I've just spent the last three hours removing the transit bolts. Help: Three hours? It should only take three minutes. Cust: well if your people hadn't tightened the bolts so tight I wouldn't have had to spend three hours chipping away at that concrete block to get the bolts out.  From my friend who runs an Electrical shop. Little old lady walks in with leather handbag. "Can you fix this leather bag for me? "I'm afraid not we don't do leather repairs this is an electrical shop. The shop you want is the shop next door. The shoe repair shop." "I know that. But they're closed."  This is one of my own stories. I was called out to look at a  single tub washing machine. It wouldn't wash.  I lifted the lid and looked inside. It was full of concrete. Hmmm I turned to lady customer and asked. "Is your husband doing any building work at the moment?" "Yes as a matter of fact he was doing our new patio yesterday." "Well he's been using your washer to mix his concrete." "Wha.........?  !?&@!! Wait til he gets home."  That's similar to the time a customer brought in her Braun Multipractic Food processor it was jammed. but only jammed because hubby had used it to mix two part epoxy resin.  Then there was the guy who took his electric shaver back to currys because "it was useless". The store assistant looked at it and plugged it in switched it on and the customer immediately said "What's that noise?" Or the guy who came in with his shaver and a face all cut and scratched. he'd read the instructions that said removed cover before shaving. Well he didn't have a cover so he removed the foil. Ouch!  As I said before you can never underestimate the stupidity of people.

      I’ve been collecting stories for a book I was going to write. The book is a look at life from my side of the counter. Everyone complains about how they’ve been ripped off by shops and businesses and how many cowboys there are in this world. But no one ever mentions what we in the trade have to put up with. How stupid the general public can be.  Many business spend millions on testing products in various rigs like they have a rig to push an appliance forward and backward a million times just to prove it was up to the job. Well I have a much better way of quality testing. Select a hundred households at ramdom and give them all your product to play with. You can bet your life if something can be broken it will be. If anything can be fucked up beyond repair you can rely on the general public to find a way. Anyway here’s a selection of daft stories from the trade for your amusement  A friend of mine in the trade fixes CD players and Hi-fi stuff. The other week a woman brought in her CD player. It wasn’t working. So  Hif-fi boy had a look. He phoned her next day to tell her there was nothing wrong with her CD player. She came to pick it up and went away. That afternoon she’s on the phone screaming abuse at him. Her CD player was still not working.  Apologising profusely Hi-fi boy told her to bring it back he’d have another look at it but this time in more detail. So she brought it back and he did every test he could with it. It worked perfectly. She took it away again and then almost kicked down his door the next day with CD player under her arm saying it was still useless and did he really know what he was doing? He put it on his counter and plugged it in, Took out a test CD and played it perfectly. The lady was gobsmacked.  “Well it doesn’t play my CD’s!” “Perhaps you’d better bring in your CD’s and we’ll try with them.” Twenty minutes later she’s back with an armful of CD’s.  Hi-fi boy takes one opens it up and the whole of the surface of the CD is scratched. With a little self satisfied  smugness he tells the lady. “looks like this is your fault, your CD is scratched what’s the others like?” She shows him the others which are all equally scratched.  “How did you manage to scratch all these CD’s like this?” he asked. “Oh I used sand paper.” “Why?” “Because my ex-husband said it would make the player grip them better and so play better.” Hmmmm    An old, but posh, lady brought a vacuum to our shop many years ago. It was an “Electrolux Automatic”. It had stopped sucking. I had a look. The bag was full. I mean so full I had to use a big screwdriver to dig it out of the machine.  When she came back she asked if I’d fixed the cleaner.  “There was nothing to fix really. You just needed to change the bag.” “Young man!” she said in her posh voice “One doesn’t buy an automatic vacuum cleaner and then have to change the bag oneself.”  Carpet man told me this one. He sold a lady a brand new front room carpet and had it fitted by his team of carpet fitters. A few days later she’s on the phone. “Are you sure that my new carpet has been stain guarded.” “Yes madam it’s certified protected with Scotchguard ©. Why is there a problem?” “Yes I spilt a glass of red wine on the carpet last night and it’s still there this morning.”  Here’s one from a help line of a major washing machine company. My friend who told me this said “ For God’s sake don’t tell anyone I work for Hotpoint.” (Well it’s OK I wont because no one reads this)  A customer phones the help line”I need an engineer to come out it’s an emergency.” “Well I’m afraid it’s too late for today it’s already nearly five o’clock, but we can get an engineer  out first thing in the morning.” “You must be joking that’s no good this is an emergency. I need an engineer today. NOW!” “Surely you can manage until first thing tomorrow? All our engineers have finished for the day.” “Well bring one of them back I need an engineer right now.” “OK What seems to be your problem?” “I can’t get into my house.” “Why not?” “I can’t open the door.” “Well surely you would be better off calling a locksmith.” “No it’s your fault.” “Our fault that you can’t open your door?” “Yes if it wasn’t for your washing machine bouncing around the kitchen and jamming against my back door shut I could have been inside getting my tea by now.”  Washing machine man went to a customers house to investigate a very noisy washing machine. When he got there he looked inside the drum and found it was so badly dented inside it looked like someone had taken a club hammer to it. Seems the lady of the house had taken to putting the cast iron trivets off her gas cooker into the washing machine to clean them. It was a right off. The next week the same lady called out washing machine man to look at her tumble dryer as thick black smoke was coming out of it. HE WENT OVER STRAIGHT WAY TO FIND…….. black molten plastic all over the clothes and the drum. Seems her children had been to Grandmas. Grandma had washed their clothes for them, handed over the black dustbin liner full of wet clothes to the kids mum  saying “Just put this in the tumble dryer they’re already washed………….”  One of my favourite websites is “The Darwin awards”. This is full of stories of people who manage to take themselves out of the gene pool, by being incredibly stupid.   Just this morning an Asian chap came into the shop picked up a 60watt  spotlight and gave me 60p. “No that’s £.140.” I tell him. “No it say 60. I give you 60.” “No that says 60 watts not sixty pence.” “I want two more dozen of these…. is good price.” “You can have two more dozen at £1.40 each.” “No it say 60 I give you cash. You keep for me I come back later with my brothers, we pay you cash… 60p good price.”  HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      My children and I have invented a new game of “Scrabble” ©. It’s called “Call my scrabble bluff”.  The idea of the game is to invent new words, words actually  found in the dictionary are not allowed. But the twist is you have to not only come up with a new word but have a plausible explanation of the words meaning. For instance, “Scafilli”; a form of pasta. Or Poondog, from  old naval usage. On a whaling vessel the Poondog was the guy who had to load the harpoon gun. A very dangerous occupation. Each of the other players then try and come up with an alternative explanation of the word. Players then vote on the best definition.  If your explanation was voted best then you get the points however if you  placed the word and got best explanation it’s  double points. Variations on scoring can be made by using the double words scores etc.  It’s a lot of fun and as a sidenote is useful to teach the kids to think of meanings of words and their derivations from the latin greek etc So it’s not such a stupid idea. My blog friend Quink of Hackney lookout has given me an idea for a sort of game based on blogs and the adverts that appear at the top. The idea is to control the advert by putting in key words that generate the most inappropriate advert for your blog. Not sure how it’s going to work but if you’re reading this B let me know what you think cause it’s you who gave me the idea. All I have to do is write the word mandolin a few times. Mandolin or mandolin strings, or mandolin music and see what sort of ad comes up when I log on again. The next stage would be to find out what the key words are they are using and try to avoid them so no advert is generated at all. I wonder if that could work. lets try it.........

      Just when you think it can't rain any harder, it does. The weather men warned us of this earlier but said it would happen like six hours ago. OK they're six hours too late. But that's weathermen for you. Anyone know of any legal way to make loads of money? I want to retire. I guess not.Perhaps if everyone in the world gave me a penny?????? I loved the idea in that film where this guy programmed a banks computer to round up every cent and put the diference in his bank account. No one would ever notice a fraction of a cent.But with the amount of financial transactions going on those fractions mounted up. I need an idea like that. Come on share with me. I need some input here. Let me have enough to live a quiet life somewhere in the country. I don't want to be rich. Just have enough to live comfortably.

      It's pissing down with rain and my bathroom ceiling is leaking. So I've had to put buckets to catch the water before it leaks downstairs. It's funny but my ceiling only leaks when it rains. So I'm sitting downstairs in the dark with the back door wide open so I can listen to the rain. The perfection to this moment would be one of two things. One that there was a thundestorm as well. Because I love those. And two, I was with my best friend watching and listening to a thunderstorm. I must tell you I often sit in the dark to write with only the light of my monitor. My friends tell me they write with music blaring from their stereos. That distracts me. Yeah You know I'm a musician so I should be listening to music all the time.But that aint so. I love the quiet solitude of the night. I love the early mornings of summer when everyone is still asleep and I am all alone and the world is mine just for a short while. And you can watch the sun rise and listen to the insects waking up. The birds singing their early morning chorus. You are the only person alive on this earth. The only other time that gets close is a Sunday afternoon when a normally busy road is dead quiet and all you can here is the faint sound of the wind rustling the leaves in the trees. Maybe in the distance you can hear children playing. But that's all, for that moment it's just you in a big big world. And it's great. The rain is falling heavier now. Out of my window I can see the gutters filling up; The drains can't take it and cars hiss by my window (The doors). I'm all alone and I love it. No one to tell me to go to bed. No one to tell me I've drunk too much. (not that I have)NO one to moan at me that I'm spending too much time on this computer. I have no one to answer too. I can do everything in my own time. It's pissing down with rain my bathroom ceiling is leaking and everything is alright with the world. That's how it should be. Maybe one day I can share this with my best friend. May your God be with you Mikel

      Tonight I had my music club and invited a guy to join us. He phoned me earlier yesterday after speaking to Richard and Abi. He wanted to play one of my showcase nights. So Charly turned up and we jammed a while. Then he started playing his own stuff. Well I must tell you he is good. His music is very good on the ears. He also told me he’d never had any lessons, which explains why he plays such strange chords which spookily enough work very well. He certainly has potential. He’s young,  has a slightly operatic voice, not exactly rock and roll, but great to listen to. I’ll let you know what develops. I’m not sure you’ll see him on TV, but he has potential as a working musician. I think I’m going to have to book him as a new talent act.   I'm going to watch "The blues brothers" now. Great film. May your God be with you.  Mikel

      My microwave engineer had a phone call today from his wife. Their next door neighbours had police vans in their yard. The door was broken down and articles removed. Most importantly a plastic bag full of white powder. The police waited for them to return and surprise surprise they were taken to the police station for questioning. Now the amazing thing is that their neighbour is a plantsman. He grows herbs and shrubs for his garden centre. Hardly the image of a major drug  dealer. I asked microwave man if he had ever suspected anything. He said “No they’re regular people they have garden parties and everything. Solid citizens.” Well it’s obvious that not is all it seems. Your own neighbour could be a pillar of society and yet be a child molester, drug dealer or criminal. Makes you think doesn’t it? It’s always the last person you suspect. It’s a scary world out there. Behind closed doors anything can happen. Fred and Rosemary West spring to mind.  Another crazy could be living next door to you and you wouldn’t know it. Peter Sutcliffes wife never suspected a thing and he was “The Yorkshire ripper”.  You don’t know about me. I could be anything. I only tell you what I want you to know. I could have some dark secrets. I could have another life and just give you this veneer of a life. I play the part of a really nice guy but do you really know? What sort of dark deeds lurk in between the lines? Perhaps you should lock your doors because I know where you live. Everyone has secrets. Even you, and you know I’m talking about you…………you know who you are, and so do I.  But I’m a musician so that’s alright then. I can’t be bad. How many musicians do you know who have turned out to be mass murderers? None. So that’s me in the clear. I will give you the exception of Gary Glitter who has a penchant for little boys, and Pete Townsend who was cleared of all allegations. Being as he was just doing “research into child abuse”.  I’ve been trying to master U2’s “With or without you”. Actually it’s an easy song. But try singing it in the key they play it. I croak.  So to sing it successfully I’ve had to detune my guitar by one tone. Then play it in C. So effectively I’m singing it in B. Bono sings it in D. Although if you listen to the live version even he drops it down to C#. Here’s another thing you music lovers might not have realised. When these boy bands play, the producer almost always puts it up a key or two so the boys are singing higher than normal. This is because they will then sing more like girls. The girls love this and they tend to scream more the higher the boys sing. It’s all psychological but the powers that be have noticed this and taken advantage of the fact. It was first noticed when the Beatles sang really high, the girls screamed fit to bust. It took them a while to figure it out but now it’s common practice. So now the live version is nothing like the album version. They can’t possibly sing that high in real life. It’s all digitally enhanced. My daughter is going to see “Busted” next weekend. I will bet a weeks pay that they will be singing a couple of semi tones lower than the cd.  One day I might tell you my dark secrets. But I promise you they aren’t that dark. I’m not a mass murderer or a child molester. I don’t deal in drugs and although I’m an atheist I believe in the Christian code of life. What goes round comes round. Be nice to people and they will be nice to you.  Well it sometimes works. There’s always the mad bastard who fucks it up for everyone. But that’s what you have to live with. The only trouble is you never know who the mad bastards are. Until it’s too late.  May your God be with you. Keep the faith. Mikel

      We arrived at the pub just as they were making the speeches, all dressed in our finest, except I was still wearing my hat. Before anyone could say anything I said “The hat stays.” How can I be Mike da hat without my hat? I guess it must have looked odd me dressed in my three piece suit and still wearing my brown leather hat. We got drinks and set about eating the sandwiches, vol au vonts, sausage rolls, chicken legs, quiche, cheese squares with pineapple chunks on sticks etc.  The groom was dressed in full Scottish rig complete with kilt and sporran. The bride in an ivory coloured flouncy bouncy wedding dress that competed for space in the small room. After setting up we retired to the beer garden to plan our attack. “Thank you for the days” followed by “Brown eyed girl”, “love of the common people” and  the REM medley. That’s as far as our plan went. We decided to wing from then.  So that’s new. We actually planned the first four songs. Normally we haven’t a clue what we’re going to play until we play it. The groom came up to me and said “My best man Anton, he plays a bit of guitar, do you think he could do a couple sometime.” Oh God! You know my heart always sinks when someone says that or similar. “I’m a bit of a musician myself.” They say in that God awful tone which doesn’t seem to have any accent at all except that it’s obvious they come from the land of dork. Well to humour the people paying us we agreed straight away. “Of course Anton can play. He can open the second set.” He opened the second set. Brilliant. He played two by himself. We were impressed so we kept him on stage for a few more, Eddie Cochran and Mustang Sally. Finally to rapturous applause he came off stage to be reunited with a large drink waiting for him at his table.  By now I was in my normal stage gear, I was totally pissed off with the three piece suit motif, it’s just so not me. Back to jeans, shirt, boots and leather waistcoat. WE bounced through the rest of the night. Well I certainly did.  At one point Tony just stopped and looked at me as I was bouncing around with my 12 string, he threw a nod to Del and grinned. Mikes off on one. Tony picked up the radio mike and started doing what he is best at. Working the crowd. He is brilliant at it. That leaves Del and I on stage playing guitars. So we’re playing and Tony disappears. He’s singing into his radio Mike but we can’t see him. Then he comes in through the back door, then out the front going round the pub I see him  in the street through the window and he’s still singing, then in the back door again. He loves it. We played until gone midnight, working our way through loads of songs Irish folk songs Wild Rover, Fields of Athone rye (Yeah I’m not sure how to spell that OK) to 500 Miles and the beatles. Great night.  I love it. Especially when you get paid to do something you’d quite happily do for nothing. But being paid is better. Thank you.

      So I'm all set to go, my guitar and mandolin packed,dressed in my stage gear and Di phones. Because we are playing at a wedding Tony has decided we must be smart. He's wearing a Tux. Eeeek! So out comes the black shoes and the three piece, shirt and Mickey mouse tie, and into a rucksack go my lovely stage clothes. In case I want to change later. Which I will do. Definitely. Suits and I don't sit well together. Meanwhile Di is dashing around trying to cobble together a set of clothes for Del to wear. We're gonna be late.  This ain't rock and roll. This isn't what they told me it would be like. Who's my Member of parliament on this matter? Who can I write to? Which particular quango has been formed to administrate the wearing of three piece suits on stage when we're supposed to be rock stars? I think I might have to hang up my 12 string in shame. We'll be like some seventies motown band all in suits and singing and dancing in unison. Oh God I feel sick!!!!!  Just give me some of that rock and rollin' music any ol' way you choose it. It's gotta back beat you can't lose it any old way you use it. Gimme some of that Rock and roll music if you wanna dance with me.

      We are playing a wedding this Saturday. The lady getting married came to me and said "There might not be a wedding." "Oh! Does that mean we might be cancelled?" "Christ no! If I don't get married I'm going to have a bloody great party instead." We played last Saturday night. Started 9:00pm and played til 01:00am Then Tony went home with Debs. Del and I carried on playing until 02:30am.  The pub did't shut. So we just kept on playing while the punters cried out for more. Finally after 5 and a half hours playing my fingers were hurting. I said to the landlord "Throw Del out for his own good." and I took him home. The sun was rising as I got him to his door. I had a few hours sleep and went back to the pub to collect our equipment. Got back to Dels and he was in his dressing gown at the top of his stairs. he looked dreadful.  And in a pathetic voice he said "pub."  "You are in no condition to go to the pub Del." "Pub." "Ok perhaps you're in the best condition to revisit a pub. But count me out." I went to RAF Waddington to see the Air Show. Brilliant except when there was a cloudburst and we all got soaked to the skin. So we stood there watching the Red Arrows with our jeans clinging to our legs. It's a good job the Italian display team went first because there is no way they could follow the Red Arrows. The best bit was when the jets went over at full speed and the noise went straight through our bodies.Very visceral. The louder the better. I was really pissed off when a display came on and they played music to it. I don't want to listen to music I want to listen to the roar of the engines. I want to hear those Jet engines going into over drive. I want to feel it. I don't want some poxy music over the top. Danny came round last night he installed some soft ware on my computer so I can record DVD's. Not just record DVD's but get by the protections of real DVD's. It's illegal of course. But Hey! I forked out good hard cash to watch Lord of the rings at the cinema so I can pirate the box set for my own amusement and the amusement of my children and my good friend Danny. Who supplied the software that over rides the copy right protection stuff. I gave the DVD's to my boy. he said "That's illegal Daddy. You can't do that." He's very moral, that's how I have taught him. So I said "OK I'll take it back then." He said "What's done is done. We might as well watch it." So he can watch it in all innocence. It's the extended version for Chrissakes! So he spent the evening watching the DVD out of the corner of his eye.  Watching but not really watching. Watching by default so he doesn't feel guilty. That's what I love about my boy. He has standards. He knows what is right and wrong. I guess that's his mother in him. I have standards but there are limits. I bend the law a little.  But to me life is a game to be played. There are no rules other than the rules you set for yourself. Those rules are based on the rules where you live and, I don't know, but rules have to be broken. On principle. You have to push the boundaries a little. Just to make sure things don't get too crazy. Beaurocracy can go mad.And often it does, so we need our safe guards.Our private little protests. That doesn't mean we are bad people. It just means we still want our own independance. To think the way we want to think, and to do what we want to do. Without politically correct legislation ruling our lives.   That's it for tonight. May your God be with you.

      I haven't told you this but I've been writing a book.  The posting of a few days ago about Helene was just one of the chapters. So as an experiment and to find out what you think, here's another chapter. You may need a little back ground information first just to put you in the picture. I met Helene when I was fourteen on a  school trip to France. She became my best friend and confidante and penfriend. That was until her father took a  shotgun to me and I never saw her again for twenty some years. This chapter is when I first meet her again after all that time.  I hope you enjoy it. Read on............  Monday 18th December 2000, Ryanair flight FR514, Stansted to Dinard, France. I sattoward the rear of the plane, looking out of the window. The English channel, coldand grey appeared and disappeared through the clouds. I didn’t know what was goingto happen. The question of chemistry had arisen many times in our letters and it was along way to go to find out we hated each other. I had told everyone I was going to visitGary who now lived in Portsmouth. I didn’t want the inevitable questions anddeclarations of insanity. I’ve done some crazy things in my time, and this was yetanother. I sat drinking my Miller Lite, two pounds for a can smaller than a standardcoke. The beer cost more than the flight. Ninety nine pence each way. My mind went back twenty two years to when I last saw Helene, how I had wished Ihad had the courage to kiss her then. No matter what happens I was going to kiss thisgirl. Number one priority. I had decided on that.The seat belt light came on and the plane descended through the clouds. The northcoast of Brittany came into view. Rough white crested waves threw themselves ontothe rocks below. Everything was grey. The sea, the rocks, the clouds. It started raining.The plane banked right for the final approach. Then dropped to the runway. The cowlsof the engines opened up and moved back to create reverse thrust, and sent up hugesplumes of spray off the tarmac. As we taxied to the terminal. I saw for the first timehow small l’aeroport de Dinard really was. My heart started beating faster. My stomach tied itself in knots. I’d arrived in France Iwas here for three days no matter what. No matter what happened between Helene andI. Passengers started moving and reaching up to the lockers above the seats. The airwas a mass of moving bags and coats. Taking my turn I got off the plane down thesteps and across the tarmac to customs. Light misty rain came down and it was alreadygloomy, just three days before the shortest day.Collecting my bag I went through the gate to the arrivals lounge. I looked around thewaiting crowd. People greeted each other kissing and hugging. And then I saw her.Standing by the far wall with her hands behind her back. Not running toward me, notwaving, just standing there smiling waiting for me to find her just like she did allthose years ago. She hadn’t changed.  I walked up to her.“Hello.”“’ello.” she replied softly. “I’m here.”“Yes you are ‘ere.”“God! This is awkward. There’s something I must do Helene.”“Yes what is it?” she said looking round, wondering what I’d forgotten.“It’s this.” I reached out and cupped her face with my hands and kissed her lips. Shethrew her arms round me and held me tight.  “You’re shaking Helene.”“I know. I can’t ‘elp.” She didn’t say anymore she just stood there holding me, herhead buried in my shoulder. I held her closely, stroking her hair, waiting for her tostop trembling. After twenty five years and seven months, I finally had Helene in myarms. She was still petite and slim. Her hair much shorter. She wore a long coat and abright silk scarf. She looked up at me and I kissed her again. It had to be done.“Well we can’t stay here forever.” I said eventually, “where are we going?”Helene let go of me. Wiped her eyes and composed herself. “Shall we eat? I know anice restaurant near here at Dinan.”“That sounds good.” I picked up my bag and followed her to her car. A small whiteCitreon AX. In the back was her small dog. Mendy. It jumped up and down at thewindow barking excitedly. Helen opened the car and I got in.Mendy jumped on mestraight away licking my face and wagging it’s tail.“She likes you.”  We drove to Dinan not saying a word. Everyso often we’d catch each other lookingacross and turn away. But I had to look at her just as she had to look at me. The restaurant was at the bottom of  a hill, overlooking the sea. We chose a table nearthe huge panoramic windows and sat down staring at the view. We looked at eachother, embarrassed with the silence, Helene laughed nervously “So!” she said.“So!” I felt stupid,  after all the months planning this trip, all the letters, I couldn’tthink of anything to say. The ice had to be broken. “What shall we order?” I saidpicking up the menu. Helene chose a sea food dish, I chose steak.“Ah ah! It’s a choice for a man.”“I don’t like sea food much.”“You can not live in Brittany and  not eat sea food. I will show you one day ‘ow goodit is.”“And I’ll show you....... what shall I show you..........” I tailed off trying to think ofsome nice english food.“...that the food in England is not good?” suggested Helene.“well I don’t eat much English food. It’s  all italian and indian and chinese.”“So it’s true English food is bad.”“Well you eat frogs and snails, how bad is that?”“I never eat that.” and she looked at me indignantly before laughing. From thatmoment we never stopped talking. In the years that followed there was never anyawkward silences, we always had something to say to each other, and when we weresilent it was never awkward, just a warm contentment with being comfortable withsomeone. Sometimes we didn’t need words, sometimes just a look told me everythingI needed to know. After the meal we walked back the car. The rain was falling like a mist. Heleneopened the door and Mendy jumped out and ran around excitedly. We got in.“What about your dog?”“Mendy? She comes back in un moment when she’s ‘ad a run. .....So!” and she satstraight up in her seat, hands folded in her lap. Waiting. I kissed her. Mendy jumped up at the door which Helene opened and let her in. Only to run aroundthe car with wet paws. “I must tell you. Do not touch my handbag when Mendy is inthe car.”“What this one?” I said turning and picking up her brown leather shoulder bag whichhad a purple silk handkerchief knotted round the strap. Mendy growled. I patted heron the head and sliding my hand down her muzzle grabbed her and gently shook herhead.“No one can do that. except me. My dog protects me. Kiss me.” I move to kiss her andMendy stood up and growled. “She doesn’t even let my ‘usband kiss me.”“That’s lucky.”“Oui she is my lucky dog.”We drove the two and a half hours to the south coast of Brittany, through many smallvillages and dark country roads. I looked at everything in Helenes car. her cassettesher map books, bit’s of paper, toys in the back and she sat there smiling.“You are curious? No?”“Inquisitive.” I replied.“What is inquisitive?”“Curious. I  like to see things. I like to look.” Helen always found it amusing that I hadto look at everything, I wasn’t being nosey so much as I had a desire to know as muchas possible and the more I looked about her car the more I knew about this girl. Ifound out what music she listened to in her car. My music, tapes I’d sent her.Shopping receipts told me what she liked to eat. We finally arrived at the Hotel in hertown and booked into the room she’d reserved for me. We went up the stairs. Helene,being claustrophobic, refused to use the lift. I opened the door and stood back to lether in. She stepped in a couple of feet and stopped looked round. Into the bedroom shelooked everywhere inspecting the table, the curtains, TV, patted the bed, ran herfingers along a shelf and finally shrugged and said “it’s OK.” as if to no oneparticular. She turned to me “You know I ‘ave just one hour and I have to feed mychildren.”I had nothing to loose. I’d come this far so I held her and said “We’d better go to bedthen.”She said nothing, just looked at me carefully then turned to close the curtains. “oneminute.” she whispered and went to the bathroom, from where she called “Mikel.Turn off the light.” I undressed and got into bed and waited.  I could see her come outof the bathroom,   her slim naked body silvery grey in the darkness. Quickly shejumped into bed and pulled the covers up tight round her neck. Finally my Helene was in bed with me.  I told Helene I was writing a book. I asked her if she minded me telling our story.She said that was OK. But........... “you can write anything, it’s a good story, it’s our lovestory,  but what happens in bed is for me and you, no one else. I don’t want you towrite about that.” So sorry guys. Rules is rules. If that’s the conditions set by the girl. Ihave to abide by them. Anyway I tend to agree with her. Comments criticisms all welcome. Requests for further chapters to be posted will be considered. They're already written. Thank you. Now post your comment.

      What's the matter with you lot? You come, you read, but don't leave any comments. What do I have to do come round your houses and beat the shit out of you? Imagine yourselves sitting in your lounge and someone walks in has a look around and walks out. How would you feel?  I don't care what you say. Just say something. Validate your arrival. Tell me it's crap if you have to. Just say hello would be nice.  I know you're reading this. My counter says so. You lot are going to make me paranoid. It's not difficult you just click on the comments button.  I spent the evening with my children.  Gemma devised this dungeons and dragons game just for me. I've never played it before. It was based on Lord of the rings. I didn't think it would be so much fun. There was Gemmalah in the part of Dungeon mistress, Jamielah and Junelah and me I'm daddylah. My character was Frodo, Jamielah was Sam, and Junelah was legolas. We battled Orcs and Goblins, overcame obstacles and gained our freedom. I'm looking forward to next weeks game. God forbid I should get hooked on it. I stayed longer than I normally do just to escape the scary dragon at the end. Then went to the Cavendish  to confirm next weeks gig. There was only three people in the pub and the landlord was about to lock up. I walked in. "where's your guitar?" he asked. "I'm not playing tonight." "That you are. Go get it." So I left my pint on the bar and ran back here to pick up my trusty six string. Two  minutes later I'm back in the pub with guitar and playing. More people came in to listen. "this is a freeby" I told the landlord. But he poured me a pint anyway. One of the guys ine the pub fancied himself as a musician and sat there criticising everything I played. So I gave him my guitar and said "You do better." he made a pigs ear of everything he tried. He made a fool of himself. He blamed the fact he didn't have a plectrum. We gave him a plectrum. Then he said he wasn't used to this particular guitar. He rapidly lost credibility. This guy is Mick.  He's a lovely guy but he's an alcoholic. he can't help it. He has done his best but can't avoid the drink. Finally his long time partner, Linda, has kicked him out.  She was there with him. They had been moving stuff out of her house to his new place. She sat there watching him drink himself, yet again, into oblivion.  It's obvious that she loves him, but enough is enough. She can't continue to pick up the pieces. I've seen this so many times. Alcohol is a great thing. But it can be very destructive. Treated with respect alcohol breaks down barriers. It makes things easier. But in excess it can destroy. I once read that if Alcohol was a brand new drug it would be immediately banned. The fact that alcohol  has been with us for longer than anyone can remember, makes it OK.  Marijuana is much safer. But that's illegal. Work that one out. I'm not going into the politics of ganga. You've heard it all before. I don't advocate ganga. I just maintain from my own experience that its a lot more preferable than too much alcohol.

      I think we've had one of the polices quickest collars on record today. We were standing outside my shop and this woman walks by and starts looking at the flowers on display outside next doors flowers shop.  Then she picks up an armfull and runs off up the road and round the corner. Just then a police car comes round the same corner Bro flags it down and they pull up. "A woman dressed in pink just stole a load of flowers." "We've just driven past her. Thanks we're on it." Quick u turn in the road and they're off.  I follow on foot less than two minutes from the time of the theft they'd got the woman caught and cuffed and sitting in the back of the prowler, the bunches of flowers sitting nicely on the roof of the car and the policeman running his hands through the perps jacket pockets. She looked pathetic sitting there. "It was my mothers birthday." she was bleeting. "...and I didn't have any money." Great! Mum will be pleased to know the flowers she was going to get were stolen.

      I'd just finished writing the last piece and I heard a scuffle at my back door. I looked outside and there were four teenagers in my car park. One of them had his T-shirt lifted up and he was screaming "Am I cut? Am I cut?" His mate said "it's just a graze he only nicked you." "I've been fucking knifed." "No he missed. There's hardly anything to see." I just stood in my doorway calmly watching them. The merest trickle of blood came from the stomach of this stocky young lad who was swaying, obviously drunk. They had two girls with them. Both very young painfully thin and wearing tight jeans and crop tops. "Come on Darren." said one girl "it's not worth it." "I'll fucking have 'em." "No you won't." said the voice of reason in the form of the tiny girl, "you aint doing anything." She looked at me and said "Sorry mate." I nodded an acknowledgement at her and she led the boys away.  Earlier today I witnessed outside my shop a women beating her boy. She was screaming at him "I've fucking told you time and fucking time again not to fucking swear." Each "fucking"  coinciding with a cuff round the head.Now that's a novel way of teaching kids respect.  I had a letter of complaint today.  This old guy came in and asked for a foil for his shaver. I sold him it. Two days later I get this letter from his son saying that his father really wanted a foil and cutter and if we were any sort of business and gave any sort of service we'd have known. So in view of the fact that his father is a pensioner and penniless could I send  the correct part free of charge being as I should have known that what he asked for wasn't exactly what he wanted. I wrote him a letter saying "Full marks for a good try but I can't give away free spares to rectify someone elses mistake." I await the fury that ensues.  Which reminds me that it's getting close to recruitment time at our local college. I might sign on for a course in telepathy. I've done the course which teaches me to suck air between my teeth and slowly shake my head whilst saying "it's not the labour dear, It's the spare parts." and the advanced module that teaches you to say with credibility "of course your Dyson is worth fixing" whilst holding back the howls of laughter. There is a saying in the trade that Dysons suck. Now you can take that in any way you like and it will be true. There's a sticker on the handle of everyone that says "no loss of suction" the adverts say "100% suction 100% of the time". Now I amazes me that no one has gone to the trading standards about this. Because 90% of the Dysons we get in for repair come in because they don't suck anymore. They have lost their suction. So what's that sticker all about on the handle. "No loss of suction"? Someone somewhere is telling porkies. The world should know. OK I'm not Michael Moore producing an epic like Faranheit 9/11. But the world should know this. Dysons are not what they claim. They tell you you don't have to buy bags so you save money. What they don't tell you is the filters can cost you £20 each and there's two of them. Put them in your shopping trolley in Sainsburys and see your weekly shopping bill go through the roof. £5 for a pack of bags seems more economical to me.  And while I'm on my own personal hobby horse. The BBC who never advertise has done a remarkable job for James Dyson with documentaries and plugs. Then James himself who whilst proclaiming that the Dyson is a true british product,  only moves production to Korea. Making all his British  workers redundant. Well he's a true brit. When does he get a knighthood for that little move? Sorry I'm getting cynical and I still haven't mentioned my guitar or music.  Time for bed I guess.

      So I’m standing in the middle of the town square in Beauvoir-sur-mer. It’s midnight and I am freezing. All I have on is my jeans, a T-shirt and a thin denim jacket. The square is silent and empty. A few street lights and dim lights from shop windows are my only comfort. For some reason the white light of  phone booth is not inviting. To kill time I wander up and down the square crossing the roads like crossing a lawn. I look in the shop windows and for a while get mesmerised by the flashing cross above the pharmacy. It’s cold. The wind isn’t strong, but it’s coming in off the sea and cuts through my thin clothing. I press myself against a wall in a vain attempt to keep warm. A light goes on above the hairdressers in the corner of the square. A man with dark hair looks out and then in my direction. I turn round and pretend to walk purposefully somewhere. But there’s no where to go. I can’t leave. The window is shut and shortly after a door opens below. The man comes out and walks toward the phone booth. He glances in my direction. I ignore him. He walks into the booth and picks up the handset he doesn’t dial any number. After a minute he puts down the phone and comes out. Looks around, and, as if noticing me for the first time,  he walks in my direction. He gets closer and it’s obvious he is coming straight toward me albeit at a diagonal. He speaks with a low growl “Bonsoir.” “Bonsoir.” I say. “Eh Anglais huh? Qu’est ce que vous faisez ici?” « J’attends ma amie. » « Et bien ! Ou est elle ? » “Elle arrivera.”  The French hairdresser looked at me closely. “Eh Anglais you wan’ slip. You slip with me. Is good. Is warm. You slip good.” “NO thank you. Merci. Mais non.” “When you cold you frappez, ma porte compris? You slip with me. » he makes a sign of  knocking on a door. “frappez plus forte. Compris?” “Oui. Je compris.” “Et bien mon ami a toute a l’heure. Salut!” He walked back to his boutique, looking over his shoulder every few steps to see if I followed. I didn’t. A gust of wind took away the little warmth remaining and I started shivering. Christ! What am I doing here?  How do I get myself into these situations?  Just a few hours earlier I had been safe and warm and life was good. I’d come to visit a childhood sweetheart, we were still in love after all those years but she was now married. Her husband away on business. You know the score.  She’d put me up in a derelict cottage. It was close to her house and warm and dry with all amenities except electricity. But then candles are so romantic. I’d spent a wonderful day with Helene, until she had to go and pick up the children from school. So for those hours between them coming home and going to bed I disappeared somewhere. This day I walked the 10 kilometres to Beauvoir-sur-mer. It was hot and sunny and the town was alive with activity. I stopped in a local bar for a glass or two of Amstell, exchanged a few words with the locals and had a very pleasant afternoon and then walked back. The sun was just going down as I got to the outskirts of Helenes village. I was hot, tired and thirsty. Helene was walking her dog and called me. The youngest children were in bed asleep and the tow oldest were out with friends and wouldn’t be coming back. She invited me into her house for a beer. No sooner had I got into her sitting room when the two older children came in the back way. They stopped and stared at me. Who are you? They asked. With quick thinking I announced I was a tourist on a walking holiday and their mother had invited me in for a beer because I looked so hot and tired and the local bar was shut. The boy immediately seeing I hadn’t yet got a beer ran to the fridge. And we all sat down and chatted for a few hours. Eventually I said “Well I’d better be on my way back to my hotel.” “oh where are you staying?” asked the girl. “At beauvoir-sur-mer.” “That’s ten kilometres oh mamman you must give him a lift back to his hotel it’s very late and it’s a long walk.” “That’s very kind of you.” I said getting up. So that was a cinch we’d get in the car drive a ways down the road fool around for a while then she’d drive back and I’d walk the few hundred yards back to my derelict cottage. Except that wasn’t the plan. Oldest daughter pipes up again. “I’d better come with you, Mamman doesn’t like driving by herself in the dark.” Helene and I looked at each other. Shit! Merdre! While the daughter was getting her coat Helene grabbed me “I’ve got to take you to Beauvoir-sur-mer. I’ll drop you off  and come back for you later.” Good plan. We climbed into the car and drove to Beauvoir-sur-mer. The daughter kept asking me questions “Where’s your hotel?” “It’s just round this corner.” “What? That’s a supermarket there.” “Sorry it must be the next corner.” “There’s only a petrol station and a few shops round the next corner.” “It’s too dark to get my barings. I tell you what drop me off in the town square I know my way from there.” “if you’re sure?” said Helene. Helene pulled over in the middle of the town square and I thanked them for their kindness and assured them I’d easily find my way to my hotel. I  waved them goodbye.  The cold was getting worse, the shivering had gone to my teeth and I was jumping up and down on the spot. I didn’t dare hide in a shop doorway lest Helene would miss me when she came back. Half  an hour became one hour and one hour became two. Car headlights would appear in the distance raising my hopes only to either turn off or drive straight past. I was beginning to think that this particular adventure was maybe a huge mistake. I had visions of the Hairdresser finding me next morning dead in a shop doorway. I had doubts about my own sanity, doubts about the reality of the situation I was so cold I wasn’t thinking straight. I kept thinking that as long as I am shivering I’m OK I still have enough energy to shiver. It’s when I stop shivering I should worry. Two pairs of car head lights appeared in the distance. One of them  must be Helene. They got closer four headlights only one car. I was shivering so much I could hardly see. The car stopped and helene leant over and opened the door for me. She was crying, tears streaming down her face. “What ‘ave I done to you Mikel? I’m so sorry.” I fell into the car and she put her arms round me. “Mikel you are so cold.” “Je sais.” was all I could say.  She rubbed my arms and my back trying to get some warmth into me. She said “I’ve brought you coffee and food. Drink! It’s warm, it’s good for you.” She took the plastic cup from the top of a thermos and poured me a drink. I couldn’t hold it. My hands were shaking so much. She  held the cup and I held her hands and she put it to my lips. The car heater was on full and slowly the warmth came back to my body and I was able to hold the cup myself. She started driving back to the village. “per’aps we are crazy to be doing this thing.” She said. “You love me don’t you?” “Yes of course Mikel. You know that.” “Then it’s not crazy.” She started crying again. I knew love, for me, was never going to be easy.   Names and places have been changed to protect the guilty. Any similarity is purely coincidental unless you know better. I reserve the right to withdraw everything I have written should a court case ensue. I unreservedly apologise to the Hairdresser involved for refusing to go to bed with him. If I insinuated in any way that he was gay/ homosexual or in  any way disparaged his character, I apologise.  But I wasn’t taking any chances. Anyway he wasn’t my type. I prefer my men to have a distinct lack of penis, facial hair and have  curves in the right places, breasts are an advantage. Although I have known several women who lacked in that department but excelled in others so it didn’t matter. “Bra? That’s what I keep my Kleenex in.” Oh yeah and I keep my socks in my Calvin Kleins. I apologise to my son Jamie for not mentioning music once in this blog. I apologise to my Daughter Gemma, for not having enough gratuitous sex in it. I don’t apologise for being their father.

       urlLink    IN case you're interested my friend who couldn't sleep, Mike Fowler is the one on the right dressed in white playing his Gibson Epiphone something or other. Simon knows exactly what it's called. Me, I just play the things. I don't care what it is as long as I can get a tune out of it.  I suppose that also reflects my taste in cars.As long as it gets me from A to B I don't care what I drive hence the pile of crap in my car park. It's a box with four wheels what more do you need to know?&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Julie Simons girlfriend wanted to be famous too. She said "I'm not a musician though I'm just a nurse." Well she's cute, she's lovely and nurses are important. So here she is with her beloved. How could I say "no"? God it don't rain but it pours I've just had a call from another musician friend of mine Mike Fowler. he's on his way for coffee. It's 11:50pm doesn't anyone sleep round here?&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Ran my music club tonight. Simon was there with his new Gibson J200. A beautiful guitar. Plays really well. Anyway Simon wanted me to put his picture on the blog. He said " I paid £5 to have my face painted. So if it's on the net I'll get more value for my money." So here he is getting his face painted at the music fest on Sunday. There was a queue of loads of children and then Simon. Tonight we were wortking on an arrangement of "Get back" for the roof top gig this Saturday. It's got to be done. Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner, but he knew it couldn't last.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is Simon and Alison playing as Simile. Now here's a treat for you that really is Pete Townsends old guitar that Simon is playing. The reason they look odd in this photo is because they'd both just had their faces painted. David and I were sabotaging their sound stage right. Not deliberately I must add. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    By this time Del had broke his guitar string and Tony had been walkabout and brought back these lovely girls to sing with us. I don't know how he does it. But then that's Tony. We let him loose in the crowd and he works the magic. What you  can see here is me with my fabulous Yamaha 12 string. So far my official photographer hasn't come up with a pic of Baby. Baby is my mandolin. Hey! How come I don't have girls hanging on my arms? What's Tony got  that I haven't? Hair maybe? Charisma? A BMW convertible? That's more like it.Satuirday night he asked Del and I "Have I got 'Fuck me'  stamped on my forehead. To which Del replied "No, it's on the neck of your new guitar you bastard!" I should be so lucky that girls fall at me feet begging for sex. They say to me things like "Mike da Hat You're so sweet!" Well I don't want to be sweet. I've had it with being sweet. The next time a girl tells me "I like you as a friend but....." Andre help me out here. You know where I'm coming from. I'm a fucking rock star. People scream at me for more, but do I get laid?  Do I fuck! So those of you harbouring dreams of being a musician just to get laid forget it. Unless you are getting laid already it don't make any difference. You just have to live with the adulation and the screams of more more more. More sex? No! Just more of working your fingers to the bone. But the screams for more is a buzz.When they start chanting and banging the beer glasses on the table. Well that's better than sex any day. Don't disillusion me. That's what I tell myself.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    God! Here we are again.Haven't a clue what we were playing but it was obviously before Del broke his guitar string and all hell let loose. Del took Tonys Ovation, and Tony went walkabout with his radio Mike. Leaving just me and Del to play the music. It's great that we don't have a plan. Because then we don't have anything to worry about. We just carry on. We never rehearse. We go onstage and we don't know what we are going to play until we play it. So breaking a string is not a problem. We just go with the flow.   How come I don't have a black T-shirt? At this point I don't think Del had sobered up from the night before. Funnily enough Del can drink as much as he likes and still play like he wuz a demon. Me! I get pissed and I forget everything. I was on decaff coke by this time.  That's Debbie in the back ground. Tony was quite sober and Del was officially wibbly again. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Finally my official photographer has sent me some pix. This is us Del left, Tony middle and me at the far end. How come "me" doesn't warrant a capital letter? How come I don't get a stool to sit on? Yeah but  "the pig in a bun" was really good. There was  a hog roast that day too. I never told you before but then I didn't have time to tell you everything. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    My official photographer so far has released only this picture from yesterdays music fest. I was hoping for better. But you gotta work with what you've got. Don't worry I'm a Scorpio so I will exact my revenge in my own sweet time.By the way that's me on the right with the  Jewish dreadlocks and dodgy moustache. David is on the left. You can't tell it's been digitally enhanced can you? GCHQ would spend  months ascertaining the veracity of this one. Has it been doctored? I don't think so. That's what we really look like.......Ha Ha.&nbsp; urlLink

      It was a wild weekend. Saturday night we were playing at the Wheatsheaf. I pacled all my stuff and started walking up the road to the pub, guitar case in one hand, mandolin case in the other leads and hardware in a pack on my back. As I walked past the Cavendish pub I looked through the window there was Mr Bees sitting in the window playing an accordion. He saw me and shouted “Get in here right now!” “What?” “Get in here. We need a guitarist.” “I can’t I’m due at the Wheatsheaf.” Two guys came out the pub and gently guided me in “What you drinking?” one of them asks. “Really I’ve got to be at the Wheatsheaf.” “Fuck the Wheatsheaf. This is a much better pub.” A pint was put on the table in front of me. “Come on then give us a tune.” I got out the 12 string and started playing. I played about half a dozen songs when my mobile went. “Where are you Mike?” “I’m in the Cavendish.” “What the fuck are you doing there?” “I’ve been kidnapped, I’m playing here for a while.” Turning off the phone I said “I’ve got to go guys. They need me at the Wheatsheaf.”  And started packing away the guitar. The landlord said “I want you to play here. Next Saturday.” “I can’t I’m booked.” “I’ll pay you £90.” “I’m free the Saturday after.” “Done!”  He slapped his hand down hard on the bar. I made it the the Wheatsheaf just a little late but it wasn’t a problem. The landlord came to us and said “I’ve got something to show you.” I already knew what it was. The flat roof.  And so up on the roof, (there’s a song there somewhere) he gave us his best sales pitch for his barbeque. OK we relented. We did a deal. We’d turn up at six and play til 7:30 where upon Del and Tony would clear off to the Swiss cottage and I’d stay and play some more until 9:30 then follow them to the Swiss Cottage. Seems a good plan. We're going to play "Get back" by the beatles. Seems appropriate. We set up and sat on our stools. Tony shouted out “Evening. What do you want us to play?” Someone shouted out “Sweet home Alabama” So we did. From then on it seemed a game for the audience, to try and catch us out by shouting for something we didn’t know. But we managed to play just about everything. Maybe not all the way through. But we gave it a go. Fifty percent of the stuff we played that night was stuff we’d never played before on stage. But it was a great night. Del was getting smashed two jug fulls of some orange Malibu and Archers cocktail to which he added to each jug 2 bacardis and two vodkas. That was apart from the pints of beer he had. Toward the end of the evening he turned to Tony and I and said “I’m feeling a little wibbly boys.” Most of the audience were pretty well smashed by the end of the evening particularly this lady who is quite high up in Tescos. She was shouting at Del for all the pub to hear. “You know Del seven years ago I would have fucked you.” “Why didn’t you say anything then?” “I was married seven years ago and now you are married.” “Doh!” We went home. Next morning Del drove past my place, Diane was driving. He had dark sunglasses on. He looked rough. He’d got home and proceeded to demolish another 5 pints of beer and some Rakki ( I still don’t know how to spell that) finally getting to bed at 5:30am. I quickly loaded my car and followed them to Folkesworth for the music festival. Dels first words were “Orange whip?” a reference to the blues brothers film. Meaning “Beer?” It had to be done.  So before he sobered up we had a beer. Then another. Musicians turned up from all over. Setting up equipment and doing sound checks. We just tuned our guitars. Sound check? What’s that? Rehearsals. what’s that? “Are you boys doing a sound check?!” “No we’re going for a beer.” You see we’re true professionals, we get our priorities right. At this stage I must point out to anyone paying attention that quite quickly I’d persuaded a young lady to drive my car home for me, so don’t start on at me about drinking and driving. We were supposed to be the headline act. But someone in their infinite wisdom decided that this little bit of totty, fresh out of kindergarden, who sang to backing tapes, should have the main slot because she won some talent competition and was destined for higher things. Well after listening to her I guess the only  higher things would be stacking the top shelves at Tescos. Meeow! Put your claws away deary! No it’s not just me. She cleared the field of audience. They all went home after she sang a couple. All the other bands had a strict set list, they’d been rehearsing for months. We got on stage still not knowing what we were going to play. So nothing new there then.  Very soon Del broke a string on his guitar so any plan we might have had went out the window anyway. Del picked up Tonys Ovation and Tony just went walkabout with the radio mike around the field we were playing in. Half the time we couldn’t see him at all as he ducked in and out of the crowd but he never stopped singing or cracking jokes. At the end of the day David, the shows Compere, announced that “For those of you still not drunk enough Ad Hock (that’s us) will continue to play inside the pub.” So we went into the pub with our guitars. No amplifiers, no microphones just us. All we could do was find basic sing-a-long songs, the crowd went wild, singing at the tops of their voices. Del was slumped in a corner and Tony stopped for a fag break so I broke into “Living doll” ok it’s cheesy, but everyone sang along, then  “Trailer for sale or rent” followed by “Lucky man” by the Verve. Finally Del got a second or was it third or fourth wind and got up to play again. We did “Irish rover” all of us just bouncing round the tables with our guitars “The fields of Athone rye”. The drunken looks of joy on the faces of the crowd was wonderful to behold as they screamed for more. Finally alcohol and exhaustion took it’s toll. We stopped playing. A chant broke out “More More More” then it was the beer mugs on the tables thump thump thump. More More More. I said “OK I’ll do a medley over old London drinking songs, my old man, show me the way to go home, and knees up mother brown.” “You fucking dare.” “Why?” “Don’t go there Mike. We’re all too pissed and too tired.” So we walked out the pub to a load of cheering and singing. They were still singing as we drove out the pubs car park. So that’s my weekend, we’re doing it all again next week. MY life may be a lot of things but it aint boring. How was your weekend? Rock on dudes. Photo’s to follow as soon as my official photographer Paul Smashy, E-mails me them.
