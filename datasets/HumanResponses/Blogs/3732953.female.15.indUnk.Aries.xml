      My best friend in the entire world sent me this poem. Here it is.  &nbsp;  I asked my little angels to look after you,  And not to let you frown.  To cheer you up when times are rough,  Or whenever you feel down.  I hope they take good care of you  And bring you lots of love,  Because I called upon them especially  From Heaven up above.&nbsp;  Take care chica...you'll find better days!  &nbsp;  Gal i love you thanks you so much.

      Today was my first day at Quiznos. It was hectic. And we were so busy. It's alot harder working at Quiznos than i thought. Especially memorizing the sandwiches. Since there is a whole 26 of them on the menu. It is a pain to memorize them. Uh. But it's all fun still. I love it, but it is hard as hell. I have to work on Sunday from 3 till 9:30. Its going to be a long day.Im jumping for joy already. Thats so sarcastic, but whatever. Ill write back soon. Love Always Lee
