      Christopher.  He is my 20 month old who has been helping me with the dishes the last 30 minutes.  I think there might be a New Life Principle in his ways.  No less than 30 times he took a cup out of the dishwasher -- put it in the cabinet across the room.  I watched as he peformed the task...over and over and over.  Ahh the focus factor of a 20 month old.  Too many things to do...not enough focus to do them all.    Dishes.  Life.  New Life Principle.  Focus - 2 Tim 2:2

      I watched Tom Brokow's interview this evening and something stuck out as he was asking all the 'lefts' questions.  If there was ever any doubt that many commentators and reporters which deliver our news are liberal a look at their questions should settle the question.  Here is what I mean.  Why is it that reporters are always asking President Bush and members of his cabinet the questions which Democrats are asking?  Why don't they ask the full range of questions that are available to them?  For instance, why is it that the never ask the questions of those who are on the right of the President?  Is there a rule that the press must always take on the role of the largest adversary?  I think they assume the mantle because they wear it so naturally.  S.S.

      When Ronald Reagan took office I was just 12.  His presidency, however, was the first that I interacted with.  When he left office in 1988 I had served for two years with him as my Commander and Chief.  It was Ronald Reagan who had taught a whole generation of youngsters that the struggle against Communism was worth the fight.  In 1986 when I enlised in the USAF the Cold War was in full swing, when I departed in 1990 the Berlin Wall had come down and we witnessed the beginning of the end of Communism.  He gave his famous speech at the Berlin Wall in 1987, and in 1989 the day it began to fall I was in Germany on leave from my base in Turkey.    Ronald Reagan.  Persuasive.  Bold.  Principled.  Thank you Mr. President for teaching a generation about faith.  S.S.

      There are a lot of men currently living who have served our country honorably in a time of war.  Because not everyone who goes to war is wounded there are, safe to say, fewer individuals living who have been wounded while serving in combat.  Still, there are a lot of individuals who served and were wounded and discharged from the military living today.  Question:  Does being wounded in combat while serving as a Lt. make you fit to lead a nation?  From the week which was John Kerry's that was the only rationale given which would commend him to the presidency of the United States of America.  I think it is time to ask the question...what else has John Kerry done with life.  This is the question that has to be pounded home until finally his service as Lt. Governor, which is good leadership training, and his service as Senator, also good training, bubbles to the surface.  Ahhh, but then the record will emerge.  The record which is so, so, so....so difficult to defend.  It is here that many people will see that what John Kerry advocates now -- John Kerry did none of then.  What commends Kerry for President?  Not much.
