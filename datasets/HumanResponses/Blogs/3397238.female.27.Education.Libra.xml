      I'm going to start posting reviews/stories etc. related to this.  Any comments from anyone who's seen it are welcome.    I saw it this past Sunday and I thought it was very well done.  People are bashing MM for being biased, of COURSE he's biased.  All documentaries focus on a certain point of view.  Is it propaganda?  NO.  Propaganda doesn't back up claims with fact.  I seriously urge everyone to see this movie.  It's important.  If you feel you can't give money to Michael Moore - fine.  Buy a Ticket for White Chicks and go sneak into Farenheit 9/11.    From reading books like "House of Bush, House of Saud" and "Against All Enemies" I learned a lot of what was presented in the movie.  Moore uses public records, mainstream media reports, and expert interviews to back up his claims.   urlLink Rattled one Republican  This is one of many stories I've read so far about Republicans going to see the movie to either heckle or just have evidence to help refute their liberal friends, coming out contemplative and changed.  Michael Moore mentioned a similar story in the Newsday (a paper in Long Island).

      Ok.  I've been thinking about this one for a while now.  What is a conservative?  I feel the label "conservative" has been hijacked by the right wing much as the label "liberal" has.  What comes to mind when you think Conservative?  Fiscal responsibility?  Subdued, and well thought out actions and words?  Modesty?  Bush is none of these things.  Conservatives used to be these things, and then they were infiltrated by radicals.  I can respect a true conservative.  A true conservative:   - would NOT promote record deficit spending  - would NOT cut taxes during a war  (in fact, according to historians, NO government in recorded history has ever done this) - would NOT wage a pre emptive war  (with no regard for the ramifications) - would NOT wage a war without a clear plan  (other than 'he tried to kill my dad') - would NOT say the "jury is still out" on evolution  - WOULD conserve the environment  - would NOT make public policy decisions based on his own hubris and narrow religious views   Bush is a right wing radical.  There is nothing truly conservative about what he does and how he does it.   The republican party used to be the party of social uplift.  They were Lincoln's party, the party that supported women's suffrage.  They were contemplative about whether to go to war.  Then what happened?  They figured out they could make money on war.  THEN they became the party of big defense budgets and arms dealers.  We need to get rid of this clown.

      From the New Yorker:   THE CANDIDATE by WILLIAM FINNEGAN How the son of a Kenyan economist became an Illinois Everyman. Issue of 2004-05-31 Posted 2004-05-24  "Jan Schakowsky told me about a recent visit she had made to the White House with a congressional delegation. On her way out, she said, President Bush noticed her “obama” button. “He jumped back, almost literally,” she said. “And I knew what he was thinking. So I reassured him it was Obama, with a ‘b.’ And I explained who he was. The President said, ‘Well, I don’t know him.’ So I just said, ‘You will.’”   First of all, why would a grown man think a Congresswoman would be wearing a button that said "Osama for senate"?  I can see the initial stare - it's an unusual name.  The first time I saw it I went "who?".  But then the logical part of any normal person would take over and point out the 'B'.  But to have to be reassured that it was NOT Osama...  People joke about him being dumb - but I always thought a lot of that was in jest because he ACTS like a yokel.  But now I think he is really just dumb.  Am I being overly critical?  Or do you think that a normal person would have figured that out for themselves without needing an explanation?

      In my opinion, "Professional Development" activities should be one or both, of the following things:  1) Professional 2) Developmental  Today's little juvenille jaunt through "dealing with changes" was neither.  These things are always geared toward the lowest common denominator of employee...  those who need to be reminded to "answer the phone with a smile".  I do my job.  I think I do it quite well.  I adapt to changes when I need to.  Everyone resists change, it's healthy.  I don't need someone explaining a butchered version of Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Therapy (dummed down for pop-psychology purposes) and theorizing that "Fight or Flight" was the wrong way for people to evolve because it doesn't embrace change...  whatever.  Then we got to play a little board game with fuzzy dice and touchy feeling messages of encouragement.  All this motivational stuff is so "flavor of the month" and I hate it.  There...  I said it.

      I hope you will join me in signing this  urlLink petition  from MoveOn. It's about the new electronic voting terminals that are being installed in many states.   As you may know, the owner of  urlLink Diebolt , the maker of the computer voting terminals is an avid Bush supporter and campaigner.    This election will be close, and to not have a paper trail to conduct recounts (providing the supreme courts and over zealous secretaries of state don't intervene) is essential.  Too many are "black box" voting machines -- computer terminals that don't produce paper ballots. Without paper ballots, there's no way to know if our votes are counted correctly. Also, computers are vulnerable to malfunction -- how often does yours freeze up?   Every voting method should produce a paper ballot, so we can verify that our votes will count. Join me in calling for paper ballots, at:   Thank you.

      For all you social psychologists:  Sounds a lot like  urlLink Stanford  Circa 1970s...  From  urlLink The Center for American Progress    Guardsman Posing As Prisoner Brutally Beaten   Gaurdsman Sean Baker's experience raises serious questions about the charges of abuse in U.S.-run prisons. Sean Baker was a member of the Kentucky National Gaurd unit "assigned to the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba." While at Guantanamo, Baker "volunteered to put on an orange prison jumpsuit and portray an uncooperative detainee in a training drill." But a five man "immediate response force" was not told of the exercise and Baker was "choked and beaten by fellow [military police] on the steel floor of a 6-by-8 prison cell." Despite yelling the code word ("red") and repeatedly telling his assailants he was a U.S. solider the beating continued "until the jumpsuit was yanked down in the struggle, revealing his military uniform." Baker suffered serious injuries requiring a 48-day stay at Walter Reed Hospital. According to a September 2003 physical evaluation, "TBI [traumatic brain injury] was due to [the] soldier playing [a] role of [a] detainee who was noncooperative and was being extracted from detention cell in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, during a training exercise." Baker also suffers from "seizures caused by the beating."  GOVERNMENT LIES ABOUT THE CAUSE OF BAKER'S MEDICAL PROBLEMS: Laurie Arellano, military spokesperson, said that Baker's stay at Walter Reed was "was unrelated to Baker's prison injuries," and the military first claimed his medical discharge was "not related to the beating at Guantanamo." Arellano has since admitted that her previous statements were not true. The military also admits "the incident was partly responsible for his discharge."  SPOKESPERSON SAYS BRUTAL BEATING WAS 'REALISTIC' TRAINING: Lt. Col. Jim Marshall said an internal investigation concluded "no one was liable for Baker's injuries." Marshall said "While it is unfortunate that Spc. Baker was injured, the standards of professionalism we expect of our soldiers mandate that our training be as a realistic as possible." According to Marshall members of the "immediate response force" were "handpicked based on maturity, common sense and judgment." Arellano said that Baker's brain injuries were a "foreseeable consequence" of the drill.  INCIDENT RECORDED, MILITARY LOSES THE VIDEO TAPE: Two members of the "immediate response force" told investigators that the incident had been taped. One of Baker's sergeants "attempted to retrieve the tape but was told it had been lost or misplaced." Now a spokesman claims "it was not likely that a video existed of the drill involving Baker."

      BTW, I watched the Daily Show the other day.  He had the douchebag who wrote "Connection" a book about the Iraq Al Queda link.  Jon Stewart made a great comment I'd like to share:   What country is this: 1. Has WMD's 2. Participates in inflammatory rhetoric against the US 3. Oppresses it's own people 4. Sponsors or supports terrorist activity  You can't name just one.

      This is from a woman I used to work with.  Very cool, unique woman, and she's a nun.  A far cry from the Penguin with the steel ruler.  -----Original Message----- From: Jane Sent: Friday, June 11, 2004 11:11 AM Subject: A quiet statement   You may not join me (though I will be pleased if you do), but when I do it I wanted you to know why since my wearing red will certainly be unusual. Jane  Just a suggestion...Wearing Red on Friday  When Norway was occupied by Germany in 1940, Norwegian women began to knit RED caps for children as a way of letting everyone know that they did not like what was happening in their country. The result was that whenever Norwegians left their homes - to go to the store, to work, etc, they could see that the majority opposed what was going on in their country.  Many of us strongly oppose what this administration has done and we need to recognize each other very easily so we can see that thinking people are still the majority.  You might want to wear RED every Friday between now and election day.  Wear a little or a lot -- just be sure that when you leave your house to go about your day -- to work, to school, to the store, to the gas station, wherever you go in your daily routine -- that everyone who sees you will see that you are wearing red because you don't approve of our current administration's policies. * pass this on to your connections and friends!  When the power of love is stronger than love of power, then we will have peace.  Diana Oleskevich, CSJA Justice Coordinator Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet St. Louis Province

      IF YOU'RE NOT OUTRAGED, YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION! IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION AND DON'T VOTE, YOU LOSE YOUR RIGHT TO CRITICIZE!   My way of saying - get off your lazy apathetic american ass and vote dammit!   What is it going to take for supporters of Bush to realize he is BAD for this country?  How many lies will they let him get away with?  Last week, after the 9/11 Commission declared there was no evidence that Iraq was involved with 9-11, Bush himself went on national TV to state that  they never said that Iraq was involved with 9-11 .  So then, what pray tell is  urlLink  THIS:   Presidential Letter  Text of a Letter from the President to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President Pro Tempore of the Senate    March 21, 2003   Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)   On March 18, 2003, I made available to you, consistent with section 3(b) of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243), my determination that further diplomatic and other peaceful means alone will neither adequately protect the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq, nor lead to enforcement of all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.   I have reluctantly concluded, along with other coalition leaders, that only the use of armed force will accomplish these objectives and restore international peace and security in the area.  I have also determined that the use of armed force against Iraq is consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those nations, organiza-tions, or persons who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001 . United States objectives also support a transition to democracy in Iraq, as contemplated by the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-338). ...   Sincerely,   GEORGE W. BUSH    I agree with Janeane Garafolo that at this point, supporting Bush is a character flaw.

      This always happens to me.  I'm outside, a nice sunny day.  I leave the house and 20 minutes later I say to myself: "you know, you shoulda put some sunscreen on".  Thankfully I remembered to put some on my face, and on my tattoo...  unfortunately I was wearing a short sleeve shirt and now I look like someone who just underwent some native initiation involving pink paint.  With the obvious exclusion, a jagged line around my arm where my tattoo is, which is still stark pasty-irish white.  John has been calling me Ms. Zoidberg, and for those fans of the Dark Tower series by Stephen King...  I have a few parting words for you:  Dida-Chock, Dida-Chee

      I know I've told you all many times how much I LOVE  urlLink  The Boondocks .  The artist, Aaron McGruder pulls no punches and it's even funnier since his voice is a bitter, disillusioned, politically savvy and witty African-American boy named  urlLink Huey Freeman .  The latest series has been about the "legacy" of Ronald Regan and how the press seems to have collective amnesia when someone dies, forgetting all the terrible things this man did.  At a time when everyone suddenly was too afraid to continue to criticize Bush and his policies, McGruder kept his edge. McGruder replaced the usual comic during the post 9-11 days with  urlLink  The Adventures of Flagee and Ribbon .    The "new" Boondocks started: "Due to the inappropriate political content of this feature in recent weeks, it is being replaced by 'The Adventures of Flagee and Ribbon,' which we hope will help children understand the complexities of current events. United we stand." Ribbon then declares, "Hey, Flagee, there's a lot of evil out there," to which his compatriot replies, "That's right, Ribbon. Good thing America kicks a lot of *@#!"   If you don't read the paper regularly (like me) or don't get a paper that syndicates this comic, go to  urlLink  The Boondocks  website and get it emailed to you daily - it's free.

      Ok, I'm going to tell you a little secret you might not have heard.

      Well I figured I'd jump on this blogging bandwagon.  So from now on, any events I find amusing, infuriating or just plain bizzare will be posted here rather than emailed.    What prompted this?  Well I just saw on   urlLink Common Dreams  That the Bush run USDA has now classified frozen french fries as a "fresh" vegetable.  They needed a fresh vegetable that went well with Ketchup (which Reagan's USDA classified as a vegetable in the 80s).

      Remember how we were going to go to Afghanistan, free those people, catch the bad guy and make their lives better?&nbsp; well...     urlLink From CNN:  The international relief group Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders)&nbsp;has announced it is pulling out of Afghanistan after  24 years  because of security concerns and frustrations with the U.S. military.    AFTER 24 YEARS.&nbsp; They were there during the Soviet conflict, there through the Taliban rule, helping people who needed medical attention.&nbsp; Now, after the U.S. invaded, promised to make their lives better and subsequently&nbsp;diverted troops to&nbsp;Iraq, it's too dangerous.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of good we did - now people who depended on MSF for medical help will have even less resources than they did under the Taliban.   Way to go America!!&nbsp; Way to earn the trust of people we claim to be helping!

      This morning I was listening to WXRT (who has  urlLink Harry Shearer &nbsp;as their "Unconventional" Convention Correspondent) and he mentioned that Ann Coulter had a column  urlLink rejected  from USA Today after using derogatory language to describe the women of the DNC.&nbsp; For those of you who don't know  urlLink Ann , she's a piece of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;She fancies herself a political&nbsp;pundette, and fact-finding author, when in fact most of the bilge she publishes is either totally misinterpreted or simply made up.&nbsp;  urlLink Al Franken  devotes two whole chapters in his book  urlLink  Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell Them   to Ann.&nbsp; The first entitled "Ann Coulter: Nutcase" and the second entitled "You know who I don't like? Ann Coulter".  Anyway, back to the USA Today thing.&nbsp; She constantly says she's tired of the way elitist liberals use devisive language and attack politics to get their points across.&nbsp; Um...&nbsp; right.&nbsp; The column that got nixed from USA Today begins:  "Here at the Spawn of Satan convention in Boston, conservatives are deploying a series of covert signals to identify one another, much like gay men do. My allies are the ones wearing crosses or American flags. The people sporting shirts emblazened with the "F-word" are my opponents.&nbsp; Also, as always, the pretty girls and cops are on my side, most of them barely able to conceal their eye-rolling.&nbsp;"  Liberals apparently can't wear crosses and american flags.&nbsp; And who's being devisive and elitist?&nbsp; Ann, please continue:  "As for the pretty girls, I can only guess that it's because liberal boys never try to make a move on you without the UN Security Council's approval.&nbsp; Plus, it's no fun riding around in those dinky little hybrid cars. My pretty-girl allies stick out like a sore thumb amongst the corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie chick pie wagons they call "women" at the Democratic National Convention."  She fancies herself an intelligent political correspondent, but the best she can ever come up with is name-calling.&nbsp; She obviously sees herself as better than those "women" at the DNC - how is that not elitist?  In short, she is a blathering idiot who resorts to derogatory language rather than bothering to check her facts before publishing them in her books, which cannot be regarded as anything but fiction.  Ann Coulter- Go Fuck Yourself!

       urlLink  Donna    and I got into a discussion today about the new Star Wars movie.&nbsp; She's still holding onto the thread of hope that it's not going to suck as bad as the Fanless Menace or Bring in the Clowns, but I'm not holding my breath.&nbsp; I mean, anything George Lucas seems to do on his own, without some other talented person by his side, seems to suck.&nbsp; And I don't care what anyone says, Lucas is a HORRIBLE director.&nbsp; Great story writer and idea man - HORRIBLE director.  &nbsp;  Needless to say, this resulted in a strange connection to the Dark Tower books by Stephen King.&nbsp; They started out great - but since the car accident I think he's gone a bit soft.&nbsp; But anyway - there's a connection here.&nbsp; Stephen King borrows from Star Wars in "Wolves of the Calla".&nbsp; I think George Lucas has infected Stephen King, via Lawrence Kasdan...  &nbsp;  ======================   Donna Lee:  REVENGE OF THE SITH   Laura :  ?

Laura :  I dunno, I kinda think after the car accident Stephen King became a pussy   Donna Lee:  yes   Laura :  John and I both think that it's possible the demise of the Tower might come on 9-11-2001   Laura :  if you get my drift   Donna Lee:  duh   Laura :  fuckin cheesedick   Donna Lee:  i wrote a pissedoff amazon review about that   Laura :  THOSE ARABS RUINED THE DARK TOWER   Donna Lee:  that's not cheesedick, that's in the poorest taste possible   Laura :  it's a copout from someone who seems to have lost all imagination   Laura :  stealing from Harry Potter was bad enough   Donna Lee:  no, if he actually does it, it will be crass, wrong, tasteless, and reprehensible   Laura :  Wait - he stole from Star Wars too - coincidence?   Laura :  George Lucas has a mind erasing ray he uses on all talented people so that they suck as bad as him so that he looks good   Donna Lee:  that's possible - he did fuck up Larry Kasdan apparently   Laura :  did he? what's Larry done?   Donna Lee:  from what I heard of Dreamcatcher, yes   Laura :  and there's the connection -   Laura :  Kasdan, involved in Star Wars movies, directing a Stephen King story...   Donna Lee:  although, that would have been an excruciatingly difficult story to convert to screenplay   Laura :  Kasdan is the key   Donna Lee:  even harder than It, and we all know what happened there   Laura :  cuz I normally like his movies   Donna Lee:  Dreamcatcher should never have been made into a film

       So John was out of town the first part of this week, which means in order to keep myself busy I got a few of my girlfriends together and we went to   urlLink  Gejas    a little fondue place in Lincoln Park.&nbsp; This is the type of place John would hate, so it was the perfect time to go.&nbsp; We had chocolate fondue and some wine.    Whenever I say I'm doing something with my lady friends, John asks "what did you do, smoke tampons?".&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure where this came from, but this has now become our universal descriptor for "girls-nights".&nbsp; Do you think smoking tampons would result in brown-lung?&nbsp; Just curious.    Incidentally, Niki did explain to us how to play a tampon applicator like a slide whistle.

      I was going to write about this yesterday but didn't have time.  Now I'm waiting for a slow-ass query to run...    "You don’t support Democrats. Why should your ketchup?"    That's the tagline for the new line of  urlLink Republican ketchup .  I couldn't make this up people...  In case you didn't know, Kerry's wife is the "heiress" to the Heinz ketchup corporation.  It has a picture of George Washington on the label.  I'm not sure why Washington is considered a Republican?  I personally think he'd be horrified that the people who try to claim him as their patriotic representative have collectively done more damage to the separation of church and state and our civil liberties in the history of our country.  In any case, now they have a narrow minded ketchup (which is a vegetable!) to go with their Freedom Fries (which are FRESH vegetables).  Sigh.  On a happier note, the Daily Show was hysterical last night.  John Stewart's analysis of the gay marriage ban is priceless.  I'm sure they'll have it online soon.

      Just because the previous blog is so entertaining, and it reminded me of a great poem by  urlLink Calvin Trillin .  He's got a new book out now  urlLink "Obliviously on he sails"  which is from his two line poem describing Bush's academic records:  Obliviously on he sails With marks not quite as good as Quayle's  Some background - the following poem was written after Bush beat McCain in the 2000 South Carolina Primary.  In case you haven't read analyses of the primary, basically what happened was that the Bushies used "Push Polls" to scare people away from McCain - by  implying  things that weren't true but not actually lying ("if John McCain was a crackhead, would you be more or less likely to vote for him?").   DEADLINE POET by Calvin Trillin A Theological Analysis of the South Carolina Primary    In Kennebunk, land of the Bushes, The men of the cloth all wore tweed. And one didn't meet any Christians Like Robertson, Falwell and Reed.   But politics calls for adjustments. If right is the wing that you need, You praise God and shout hallelujah With Robertson, Falwell and Reed.  So Bush, the uniter from Texas, Said, "Since you're the fellows they heed, Do Jesus's work down and dirty, Please, Robertson, Falwell and Reed."  They blackened McCain with their phone banks And told all the voters that he'd Consort with the people most hated By Robertson, Falwell and Reed.  McCain's just too chummy with Satan, And should he, not Bush II, succeed, The unborn would have no protector, Said Robertson, Falwell and Reed.  Well, W won Carolina, For three days he had back his lead.  For this he had pledged his allegiance To Robertson, Falwell and Reed.  Yes, he made his pact--not with Satan, But, still, he will never be freed. He'll always be part of a package With Robertson, Falwell and Reed.

      So I couldn't help but share this with everyone because it's so god-damned funny.  John's dad, who sends cute political things every now and then sent a picture of Kerry and Edwards with 70's rainbow fro's (in response to the very dumb "we have better hair" comment).    John responded that he'd vote for Kerry-Edwards with any hair vs. a lying puppet.  Oh, boy...  we got a Religious shitstorm from his brother & sister in law in Arizona...  I couldn't help but include it here because I find this very amusing...  I'll be sure to post the rest of the thread once we get responses, I'm sure there will be more.    1) John S.:  Dad, If it means I have to look at bozo hair for 8 years, I'll do it to get rid of Bush. With the amount of bullshit and lies he and his administration have told, voting for Bush is a serious character flaw.   2) Lisa to John:  John,   What person has been 100% honest in their life? At least we can count on Bush for his spiritual beliefs as he has spoken in many speeches throughout his term. Do you realize where we are headed if we don't elect Christian politicians? This country was founded by godly men and everyone is desperately trying to forget why we were placed here on earth. That is to serve God's purpose and facilitate a country full of sins and seeks forgiveness towards one another. No one person will ever be perfect that is why Jesus came to pay and protect us from all the sins we commit daily. Our nation is under serious attack and we need to pray that God does allow the right politicians to direct our country.  Lisa    3) John K. to Lisa:  That's a joke, right? Christian? Whose a Christian? I'll judge people by their actions before I'll believe what they say. Please! I know far too many "Christians" who I wouldn't turn my back on then I care to admit.   So..... if we're not going to judge someone on their actions, and past life, how can you justify judging someone just because they have the Holy Moniker "Christian" associated with their name. Let's not forget why our forefathers "put" us here. It was because of persecution for their RELIGIOUS beliefs (by other "Christians" none the less). Same - Same.  John Kehoe  ==== Here's where it gets fun ====  4) Lisa to John K.:  It is NOT a joke, it's only the TRUTH!!! Well that is a shame because ultimately God judges everyone including you and me! You are wrong our forefathers did not "put us here"...God did! I'm not sure who you are but I hope and pray by the grace of God you make the right decision for you and your family. There are many people out here in this world who claim to be Christians but who are we to judge them. I believe it is about time I respond to all these remarks you all throw back and forth. If you don't want to hear them don't send them to me.  Lisa   5) John S. to Lisa: (it was actually several emails but I combined it for simplicity  The right decision for me and MY family is to vote for Kerry. God(s), if it(they) exists, doesn't(do not) want us to be happy in our lives? That's not truth.   Look - Jesus isn't running for office, and HE NEVER WILL. Not even Jesus Rodriguez or Jesus Jones. Politics should be separate from Religion. Would you vote for a person who's a card carrying Islamic Fundamentalist? No.  Would I? NO. Would you or I vote for a card carrying Hasidic(sp) Jew? Probably not.  Would I vote for a Christian Fundamentalist? No.  Q: Why wouldn't I vote for these people vs. why wouldn't you vote for these people?   A: I know that its impossible for FUNDAMENTALISTS to keep their god out of their decisions. You, however for the first two cases wouldn't because of their religion.  Who's judging now? Isn't you praying for John Kehoe to get right with Jesus and vote the GOP ticket judging? I certainly for one don't want anyone praying for me, I am quite happy in my life, and adding a Christian God even more than I have to deal with now - would just fuck up the program.   I don't care that W's religious, that's fine. He can worship a golden toilet bowl on top of the White House, while John Ashcroft sings choir and Cheney flushes.  BUT DID HE DO HIS JOB? The answer is an emphatic NO, unless you are talking about helping the rich get richer and the corporate fraud beat the shit out of good Americans. Lying and letting your people be manipulated is not doing your job.  Just because Jesus hates the man on man action isn't a reason to vote for a lying, stupid puppet.   Me personally, I prefer the Gay Menace to George W. Bush. I love the GAYS. I know several of them and they've never asked me or anyone that wasn't part of their team to take a shower with them.   But I can't say that for Christians who want me and my friends and family to GET RIGHT WITH JESUS.   Here's my prayer to you Lisa, and others like you.  (several blank lines)  That's right, there is no prayer, since I know your God loves you just the way you are.  As for "oh, who doesn't lie every now and then"...  Nobody. And your bible says we're all fucked for that.  Another thing...  The founding fathers were smart men. They guaranteed that we can all pursue happiness, worship whatever god we want, and other niceties.  The fact that they were all Christian shouldn't surprise us anymore than the fact that they were all white and probably spoke with a British accent.  The fact that some of them owned slaves is pretty well documented, too.  That's the beauty of the way this country is setup, we can fix whatever screw-ups that come our way. Maybe your notion of our nation being under serious attack is another American's pursuit of happiness. Who's right?  I have assumed that you meant moral attack, as Chicago isn't in rubble at this hour. If that's not the case I'll pack up the guns and come help you battle foreign invaders in Arizona (and I don't mean the Mexicans, somehow they have a pass to be here). I should have seen this on CNN by now, though.  Morality varies from person to person, but has some basics between each. Don't kill, don't steal, and don't shag someone you're not supposed to shag.   I kill bugs constantly, I steal time from my employer when I bullshit on the phone or internet, and I only shag the missus.   A Buddhist would be appalled by point 1. My employer frowns upon 2. And Larry Flint is just aghast by point 3.  My morals are very straight forward, don't kill, don't steal, and make sure that you do a good job, and don't stick your religion on me.  Nothing could be ruder.  Also, can you send me some of those Jack Chick tracts ( urlLink http://www.chick.com   in case you need to reorder)? I find them hysterical. My friends and I act them out for old people and at parties for each other.   6) Laura Chimes in with her $0.02:   First: I am the last person to judge someone else's religious beliefs or push my beliefs onto others - and I DEMAND the same respect from other people and my government.  The problem with "true believers" of any sort is that there is no compromise, no wiggle room, and politics is about compromise. Local leaders are a different story - if you want to elect your minister your mayor - that's your business. But when it comes to NATIONAL politics, the president should be the person who best fits the people of the country, not just one side.  Someone who thinks that the "jury is still out on evolution," forces his researchers at the CDC to censor scientific findings because they upset the religous right, and thinks that "God" wanted him to be president has no business making PUBLIC policy decisions. That is just a much more widespread and costly version of pushing his religion down our throats. It is an enormus act of hubris to not only assume that everyone believes what you do, but also that everyone should. Believe me, I too, am afraid of the direction our country is going.   7) Now comes Joey: ( I have to add that it's funny he thinks my dad is "ignorant" about religion given that he spent 18 years in catholic schools (by choice) and dabbled with Lutheranism for a while)    I normally don't get involved in these things, but I feel compelled at this time to do so.   1. Mr. Kehoe - I happen to be a Christian. And, with all due respect, you are correct; it would behoove you not to turn your back on me. Not because I have a "Holy Moniker" rather because I am appalled by your ignorance. To label every Christian as untrustworthy or - based upon your comments - a hypocrite is overkill. Please understand that I am not "judging" you, rather I do not understand your lack of knowledge in this circumstance.  2. Dittydot (I am assuming this is Laura) and John - I am glad that you "DEMAND" that others don't push their religious beliefs on you; that is a fundamental right given you under the first Amendment to the Constitution. However, I do not see anyone trying to do that. Lisa is just trying to voice her opinion on the matter. If you do not like that her basis is her beliefs, do not include her in future mailings. I am disconcerted that you wish to consider her OPINION as pushing something on you. If you are mass-mailing an open forum to discuss ideas, be prepared to get feedback that does not coincide with your beliefs. Also be prepared to consider the validity of that feedback. I believe that such an open forum is healthy in that it will either strengthen your viewpoint or it will cause you to restructure your thought process. It is how we grow as individuals.  3. Mr. Kehoe - Who is a Christian? A Christian is one who believes and accepts that Jesus Christ died on the cross for his or her sins. You may have recently been made aware of this as I believe Mel Gibson made a small fortune on a movie around this fundamental idea. A Christian is not perfect, but is forgiven because of what Jesus did. Christians do make mistakes.  4. As to who to elect and how to base that decision, base it upon your beliefs, whether you get them from religion or from a bubblegum wrapper. Base it upon what you feel is right. And hopefully, it will be an educated choice, although I am not sure if it will be based upon what I have read so far. I cannot support a candidate if I do not know and agree with his or her fundamental ethics and morals.   5. John - As to "getting right with Jesus", this is a personal choice that no one in this dialog has asked you to do. That is between you and God. I do not assume to know whether you are an atheist or you have some sort of belief beyond universal good. That being said, I will pray for you.  6. Laura - I do not understand your comments about "true believers" and no wiggle room. Could you please clarify? I also do not understand how you can differentiate between local and national leaders.   7. I am making an assumption here, but how can you complain about hypocrisy when you exercise the same. You celebrate Christmas (the birth of Jesus) and Easter (the death and resurrection of Jesus) each year. Additionally, you do not want others to shove their religion, viewpoints, and beliefs upon you but you become very agitated if someone does not agree with you. What gives?  If any of you would like to have a real discussion about politics, religion, the issues at hand, or any other item, please let me know. I will be happy to clear my schedule for you.  Bottom line folks, if you do not like my viewpoints or beliefs, or if you are offended by my expression of them, do not include me in these dialects. In fact, if you find me that offensive, remove me and my family from your mailing lists.  Joey   8) At this point, John and I decide to consolidate our response   Joe, My and Laura's answers follow yours. Mine are "J:" and hers are "L:"   1.  Mr. Kehoe - I happen to be a Christian.  And, with all due respect, you are correct; it would behoove you not to turn your back on me.  Not because I have a "Holy Moniker" rather because I am appalled by your ignorance.  To label every Christian as untrustworthy or - based upon your comments - a hypocrite is overkill.  Please understand that I am not "judging" you, rather I do not understand your lack of knowledge in this circumstance.   J: While I enjoy idle threats by you Joey (they’re quaint), John Kehoe doesn’t. I’ll let him respond on his own.    2. Dittydot (I am assuming this is Laura) and John - I am glad that you "DEMAND" that others don't push their religious beliefs on you; that is a fundamental right given you under the first Amendment to the Constitution. However, I do not see anyone trying to do that.  Lisa is just trying to voice her opinion on the matter.  If you do not like that her basis is her beliefs, do not include her in future mailings.  I am disconcerted that you wish to consider her OPINION as pushing something on you.  If you are mass-mailing an open forum to discuss ideas, be prepared to get feedback that does not coincide with your beliefs.  Also be prepared to consider the validity of that feedback.  I believe that such an open forum is healthy in that it will either strengthen your viewpoint or it will cause you to restructure your thought process.  It is how we grow as individuals.   J: Shit, man…I should check the addy’s in the list that Dad sends me.  Now, to be fair, I don’t think he expected a RELIGIOUS shit storm for sending a funny picture of Kerry and Edwards. Before Lisa opened her maw it was just a couple of simple political jabs. Religion and Politics don’t mix, or they shouldn’t. I do love that you made this about religion anyway, even after I CLEARLY stated that religion means nothing in the ORIGINAL point. Which is that Bush has done nothing but lie and stroke corporate chiefs to climax, all while killing Americans for nothing.  I remember saying that for all I care Bush can worship the dark god Kuthulu or an Andy Warhol painting that really speaks to him. I sincerely hope that you don’t think that W has yours or my best interest at heart. He’s a revenge seeking, money loving fake. Also, he can’t remember one lick of Bible passage. Even I can remember Ezekiel 25:17. Thanks to Jules!    L: Actually, my take on this is this.  Since when are opinions labeled as “truth”?  Lisa clearly implied, by using the word “Truth” that all other beliefs, save one’s similar to her own, are invalid.  That is not an opinion; that is an evangelical statement.  This is also what I meant about speaking in absolutes.  I am not saying you should believe anything other than what you believe, but to not even entertain the fact that other’s religious views are valid (a.k.a. not “truth”) is what true ignorance is.  You don’t have to believe what someone else believes to think that their faith is valid – that’s why John and I can get along – he thinks all religion is pointless, but is willing to accept the fact that I believe differently.  In fact, this is the problem with ALL organized religion – I’m not just picking on Christians here.     3.  Mr. Kehoe - Who is a Christian?  A Christian is one who believes and accepts that Jesus Christ died on the cross for his or her sins.  You may have recently been made aware of this as I believe Mel Gibson made a small fortune on a movie around this fundamental idea.  A Christian is not perfect, but is forgiven because of what Jesus did.  Christians do make mistakes.    J: You see, there’s a man that lives in the sky and looks down on you 24/7. Christians are paranoid-delusional too. L: The Goddess loves you too.    4.  As to who to elect and how to base that decision, base it upon your beliefs, whether you get them from religion or from a bubblegum wrapper. Base it upon what you feel is right.  And hopefully, it will be an educated choice, although I am not sure if it will be based upon what I have read so far.  I cannot support a candidate if I do not know and agree with his or her fundamental ethics and morals.     J: Joey, Joey, Joey…you are fool to have opened up this end. I’ll let Laura answer, who gets facts for a living…   L: An Educated choice would be to weigh all the facts, not simply discounting the things Bush has done that you disagree with.  Judge Bush by his actions not his rhetoric. So Christian values support the installment of a candidate who wormed his way into the white house, lost the election no matter how you count the votes?  Do those values support someone who cuts taxes for the rich while placing unfunded, unrealistic mandates on the public school system, leaving millions of children behind?  I guess our homeless and working poor can look forward to the afterlife when they inherit the earth?  Christian values support the relaxing of environmental standards and worker’s rights to a healthy working environment so CEOs can line their pockets even more?  Christian values support a candidate who feel’s it’s A OK to execute children and retarded prisoners but it’s not ok to have an abortion?  Christian values support a man who cuts humanitarian aid to organizations if they even mention the efficacy of condoms in preventing the spread of AIDS in 3rd world countries?  Christian values support the use of lying and push polling to dump candidates in swing states?  Christian values support the use of intimidation and the “outing” of a CIA operative because her husband disagreed with the administration?  Just curious, maybe I was in the wrong theology class freshman year.     5.  John - As to "getting right with Jesus", this is a personal choice that no one in this dialog has asked you to do.  That is between you and God.  I do not assume to know whether you are an atheist or you have some sort of belief beyond universal good.  That being said, I will pray for you.   J: Don’t bother praying for me, It’s a waste of your time, and it only insults me. L: I agree here – religion is a personal choice.  One that should remain in the home, the church the community.  Our country is far too diverse to have religion present in national public policy.     6.  Laura - I do not understand your comments about "true believers" and no wiggle room.  Could you please clarify?  I also do not understand how you can differentiate between local and national leaders.    L: See my first point about truth – that is what I mean about a “true believer”.  Secondly, my point here refers to the nature of communities.  The smaller the community (local) the more homogeneous in nature they generally are.  Therefore you are more likely to find a single leader (like a mayor, a governor, a senator) that closely matches the views of everyone, or most everyone in that community.  The difference between this and the Federal Executive branch is that our nation as a whole is not homogenous.  If we (s)elect a leader that has views so far to one side of the political spectrum (left or right) that it automatically alienates the other half of the country, we are disenfranchising entire sections of our population.  A President should be a balance, should come as close as possible to the center so as to be able to compromise with both sides.  But since he’s what I consider a “true believer” (see point #2 about truth), he is unable to compromise.  This is why religion and politics should never be mixed.  Really, while thinking this point through I almost felt like I was talking like a true Republican – aren’t they supposed to be for less federal government oversight and more state and local governance?  This way you make blanket laws for the whole country on topics we can all agree on – murder is wrong.  And leave the touchy subjects to the local level where members of smaller communities can decide what is morally right for them (gay marriage).   7.  I am making an assumption here, but how can you complain about hypocrisy when you exercise the same.  You celebrate Christmas (the birth of Jesus) and Easter (the death and resurrection of Jesus) each year.  Additionally, you do not want others to shove their religion, viewpoints, and beliefs upon you but you become very agitated if someone does not agree with you.  What gives?   J: I don’t celebrate Christmas, I participate in giving gifts to people I love because they celebrate Christmas. Just like I give my boss Chanukah presents. Just like I give my friend Rajiv Patel a gift for a celebration I can’t spell. Just like I buy Prince tickets for one of my gay friends for Pride weekend. I think Easter is laughable. I haven’t gotten agitated, I’ve gotten entertainment from you and your wife. And even from Dad. I don’t want anybody to share their religion with me. The concept to me is backwards and stupid.     L: Actually I don’t celebrate Christmas or Easter any more either (I used to as a kid before I knew it was more than Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny – both of which are PAGAN symbols by the way).  I go to Christmas and easter gatherings to see my family and because I respect the fact that they believe this stuff.  Now I celebrate Yule and Ostara, funny how those Christian holidays were formatted to fit Pagan dates.  Oh, and to be completely accurate, historical and biblical references place the birth of jesus in the spring.  Christmas was not celebrated by early Christians because no one knew when he was really born.  It became December 25 after the Roman Empire attempted to convert the pagan masses in Europe, thus co-opting Yule (the celebration of the rebirth of the Sun God – sound familiar?).  So really no Christian celebrating Christmas is celebrating the actual birth of Christ.     If any of you would like to have a real discussion about politics, religion, the issues at hand, or any other item, please let me know.  I will be happy to clear my schedule for you.   J: If you leave it political, there’s no real discussion. Numerous facts point to what Bush is all about.    L: Remember who first made this about religion…  Speaking from a pure secular standpoint, there is too much to discount, too many things you need to make excuses for in the Bush presidency to even consider him to be anything remotely close to a good leader.  That’s ok though, you live in a “red” state anyway.    Bottom line folks, if you do not like my viewpoints or beliefs, or if you are offended by my expression of them, do not include me in these dialects. In fact, if you find me that offensive, remove me and my family from your mailing lists.    J: Lets see how you take this. Then I’ll remove you if you want me to.      9) John K:  This is from John Kehoe at my home address.  Sorry for responding so late, but John has been forwarding the thread to me at home, so I'm a little behind.  I have removed the names of those from the original message who have not been participating in this discussion.  They may not want to be involved????   Joey, (although we have never met, I would look forward to it)   When did I ever "label every Christian as untrustworthy"?  Again, that's how these religious arguments go I guess, always in absolutes!  What I said was, "there are far too many Christians who I would not turn my back on".  Just making a point that if it's people of other, (or "god" forbid) no religious beliefs that we're supposed to be wary of, then watch your back.  I guess you missed the "do unto others..." speech huh?   And again I'll judge people by what they do, not idle threats or promises.  To quote a popular candidate of the times, "Bring it on."   You go ahead and accept whomever you want as your "personal" savior.  Just keep it DAMN PERSONAL.  I, for my part have still not decided.  (And, by the way, Mel Gibson doesn't do it for me either)  Even after many, many years of Jesuits and Dominicans, and Lutherans, I still cannot accept the fact that many of the very wonderful, honest and good people in my life will not be "saved" only because of some protectionist, ignorant belief.  That there even HAS to be an afterlife, is just an excuse for not trying harder right here, right now.   Religion STOP - Politics START-   As far as the original discussion goes, I kind of liked Kerry's hair.  It reminded me of  Rainbow wigs and Art Garfunkle.  I too would take Kerry and Edwards with any kind of hair, over a lying puppet president protecting the interests of our too 'oft maligned corporate millionaires.  :->   I do not have you in my address book, but will gladly add you if you're real nice to me.   John Kehoe   10) Joey:  Mr. Kehoe, as John has been so kind as to point out, I would like to apologize for the forcefulness of my first comment.  I did not mean it to be construed as an idle threat or any other kind of threat.  Your comments earlier seem to have been “lumping” all Christians together as being fakes or hypocrites.  If that is the case, I do consider that to be ignorant.  If that is not the case then, again, please accept my apologies.    If I am understanding your rephrasing, you were trying to state that I should be wary of others who are not of the same religious belief as me?  Again, I welcome discussions with others who have differing viewpoints.  It allows me to grow as an individual.     I will respond further when I respond to John and Laura’s email.  Joey   11)John K:  Here is my earlier comment which you either didn't read or didn't understand.  This is not "rephrased" but the actual comment.  Don't try to read any absolutes into it.   "Please!  I know far too many "Christians" who I wouldn't turn my back on then I care to admit."   This was included in my response to the notion that we must elect Christian political leaders, especially now that our country is under attack.  (I must admit, I read something into this last comment - under attack by non-Christians?)   So the meaning of my comment is, "No, thanks!", to electing Christians as our leaders, because I wouldn't trust a Christian, (especially one who felt that ONLY Christians have "the one true way") to lead us any more than I would trust a non-Christian.  See? No religion in politics.  We shouldn't even care what religious beliefs a candidate has.     John Kehoe     TO BE CONTINUED ...

      This is from the Guardian.  How many people even knew this was the 15th annual AIDS conference?  It hasn't been covered in the news even though we know AIDS is resurging in younger, minority populations in the US, partly because the US has curbed education efforts and people stopped paying attention.  Now Bush forces the CDC to retract statements in their literature that condoms can help prevent the spread of HIV...  This shit has got to stop!    Bangkok conference forced to cancel meetings and retract papers after authors stopped from attending Sarah Boseley in Bangkok Monday July 12 2004 The Guardian   The US government came under scathing attack from senior members of the medical establishment yesterday for blocking scientists from attending the International Aids conference which opened in Bangkok.   The biennial conference, with 17,000 delegates, is more political rally than scientific meeting and bears huge significance for those involved in the fight against HIV/Aids.    The US government has sent only a fraction of its usual contingent of scientists, pleading cost - 50 instead of the 236 who attended the last event in Barcelona in 2002.    The Department of Health and Human Services, headed by the health secretary, Tommy Thompson, was yesterday accused of actively preventing certain US scientists and doctors who had a contribution to make from travelling to Bangkok.    Many suspect that behind the action lies a rift between the US and Aids activists who oppose America's approach to the global pandemic.    Joep Lange, president of the Sweden-based International Aids Society, which organises the conference, said it had been forced to retract papers that had been accepted for conference sessions after the US scientist authors had been refused permission to come. Many meetings, some to train developing world researchers, have had to be cancelled.     "I really think it is shameful that they restricted the US government participation, particularly when you think they are putting so much money into the fight and people in the field who have to do the job are directly prevented from coming here," said Dr Lange.    Earlier, the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association (Jama) had also unexpectedly spoken out. Catherine DeAngelis said that Marc Bulterys, the co-author of a Jama paper who worked for the government's Atlanta-based Centres for Disease Control (CDC), had not been allowed to accept an invitation to fly to Bangkok to talk about it.    "It stymies the ability of scientists to discuss and learn from each other," said Dr DeAngelis. "It is wrong."    She pointed out that the trip would have been paid for by the American Medical Association, not the US government. "It is an incredible example of political pettiness. It is anti-intellectual and it is interfering with scientists and the scientific process and means American government-employed scientists are not allowed to be here to share their knowledge," she said.    Behind the fracas lies the gulf between the US policies on tackling HIV/Aids in the developing world and those of Aids activists who tend to dominate the big international event. Two years ago, Mr Thompson tried to give a speech at the conference in Barcelona but was rendered inaudible by noisy protests. This year the organisers have asked activists to be more civil and allow those with whom they disagree to be heard.    Although the US has put more money into the fight against HIV/Aids than the rest of the world put together, including $15bn (&#163;8.5bn) pledged by President Bush in January last year, activists are unhappy with the way the money is to be spent.  Most of it will go to American-instigated programmes in 15 selected countries which stress the so-called ABC philosophy - abstinence, be faithful and condoms "where appropriate".     Peter Piot, executive director of UNAids, said last week that abstinence, particularly for women in southern Africa, was often not an option.     Randall Tobias, the former head of the pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly, who runs the president's plan for Aids relief, heads the US team in Bangkok. Yesterday he said he had "a very large delegation" with him.    The CDC had offered another scientist instead of Dr Bulterys, he said. "It is true that the person who was the author was not part of the delegation but we offered another scientist and they declined," he said.    The significance of the conference was emphasised at the opening ceremony by Joep Lange, president of the International Aids Society. The Bangkok event is the first in the Aids-hit developing world since the conference in Durban, South Africa, in 2000.    "Durban was a watershed event that catalysed many developments," he said. Prices of Aids drugs came down, fundraising was stepped up and there are now plans to put millions on treatment.    "Like Durban, Bangkok could be a watershed event," he said. "The conference is strategically located in Asia, the most populous continent in the world and home to a quarter of all new HIV infections. Asia still has the opportunity to prevent the epidemic from getting completely out of hand."    Kofi Annan, UN secretary general, called for leadership from all parts of governments, all the way to the top, which has not been seen in all Asian countries, just as African leaders took years to recognise the crisis and speak out against stigma. "Aids is far more than a health crisis. It is a threat to development itself," he said.     Leadership was one of three priorities he defined. He also called for infrastructure to be scaled up in Aids-hit countries to allow more people to be treated and he called for a better deal for women who are unable to defend themselves against unsafe sex because of poverty, abuse, violence and coercion by older men. "What is needed is the education of girls," he said.   Copyright Guardian Newspapers Limited

      Every culture has its specific taboos and some taboos cross cultural lines.  Americans are much more prudish than most of the rest of the Western world; it must be the puritan roots.  People argue over abortion, gays, religion, whatever.  But there is one taboo that crosses these cultural lines and is so ingrained into our society that most people scarcely think about it at all.  Not wanting children.  We were on the el this past weekend, and there was a woman with a couple kids.  They got off the train, and this guy sitting by us started talking about how wonderful children were.  He assumed that since we were a young couple, we'd be getting on that soon.  When we told him we couldn't have children (we have decided that lying is easier than arguing - isn't that sad?) his response was that we should adopt.  So we listened to him drone on about how wonderful kids are, not wanting to say anything more.   Why is it, whenever I tell somewhat I don't want kids I get the same, pre-recorded response:  "Oh you'll change your mind"?  They think there's something wrong with me, or that I'm just a dumb kid who hasn't grown up yet, and when I do, I'll naturally get the urge to breed.  They don't seem to get it, that this is a concious, carefully thought out decision.  When I see children, I feel NOTHING.  I don't get all oochie-gaga-goo.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  I have probably given more thought to not having children than most people who end up having them.  I would never presume to go up to a new mother and say "oh, give it a few years, you'll change your mind"...  Maybe I should start doing that, if only to point out the absurdity of assuming what choices someone you barely know should make?

      Former president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein appeared in an Iraqi court to face chages against him.  I have to say that no matter how you feel about the war, you have to feel good that he will be brought to justice.  I wonder how they will find an "impartial jury" for this one?  I'm happy to see this process being undertaken in a courtroom, and that the proceedings will be mostly public.  The people of Iraq and of America need to know the truth about the trial, and the outcome.  It could be a secret tribunal, sealed proceedings, and unknown outcomes...  oh wait...  that's what's happening HERE.  Let's not be too hasty though, there's a long way to go in Iraq before (or if) it becomes a functional democracy.    Now lets get our troops out of there and NEVER send them into harms way ever again for lies, manipulations and greed.

      This was a great weekend for movies.  I love movies, always have, and I saw three great ones.    urlLink Napoleon Dynamite : This is without a doubt the strangest movie I've seen in a long, long time.  It takes the "high school geek" movie to a WHOLE different dimension.  Napoleon Dynamite revolves around Napoleon, this really strange high school kid in Idaho, his internet addicted brother, Uncle Rico, and his two friends from school Deb and Pedro.  I don't want to spoil anything, but this movie is "Friggin Sweet".  I don't think I said "What the fuck?" so many times in a movie.  You can't help but laugh at the pure absurdity.    urlLink Garden State:  Zach Braff from "Scrubs" wrote, directed and starred in this one.  It's another one of those 'home after a long time, reconnecting with people you no longer have anything in common with' stories.  It's really well written and directed, and the characters are great.  I loved it, John thought it was really good but thought it would be better.  Zach Braff is Andrew Largeman, who's come home for his mother's funeral.  He hasn't been home in years and has decided for this trip to not take his medication (which he's been on in some form since he was nine years old).  It's really quite good, definitely worth seeing.   urlLink Collateral:  John really wanted to see this.  I was indifferent.  It was playing 10 minutes after Garden State ended, so we just snuck (is that really a word?) into the theatre and saw it for free.  I don't feel bad since what we saved on the movie we paid in the extra 2 hours of parking.  It was ok.  Your typical, predictable, hollywood hit-man, cop drama.  You knew how it would end within the first 15 minutes.  It was good and Jamie Foxx is a good actor.  Tom Cruise was actually believable as a hit man.  I wouldn't recommend paying $9.50 for it, sneak in or wait for cable...

      I had to post this:  "I deeply resent the destruction of federalism represented by Hillary Clinton's willingness to go into a state she doesn't even live in and pretend to represent people there, so I certainly wouldn't imitate it"  --Alan Keyes in a statement he made to Pat Buchanan on Fox News in March 2000 about suggestions he move to New York to run against Hillary Clinton.  There's no way he'd beat Obama's mojo, but it will be interesting.

      Texas is the second largest school district in the country and holds a lot of sway with the textbook publishing industry.  Usually books that are accepted by Texas and/or California are marketed nationwide.  According to  urlLink CNN  Texas will probably approve a number of sex-ed textbooks that make negligible, if any mention of contraception or methods of STD prevention other than abstinence.  No matter your moral beliefs about the issue, we have a responsibility to educate our young people in a realistic manner.  Teach them to fear and be ashamed of sex if that's your flavor of religion.  But from a public health standpoint it is imperitive to give ALL the facts, not just those that are supported by a narrow interpretation of a two-thousand year old text that has been through so many translations and edits for political purposes that we have no idea what it originally said anyway.  As was pointed out by participants from the  urlLink International Aids Conference , the "'ABC'" policy, which emphasizes abstinence and faithfulness over condoms [is] brutally irrelevant to the millions of faithful women infected by their husbands" in Asia.  I remember hearing a statistic a few years ago in a class that for women in Thailand (where AIDS is running rampant) that a woman was five-times as likely to contract AIDS if she was married than if she was single!  The Bush policy does not take into account any cultural differences across the world, especially in places where women do not control their own sexual lives.  For Bush to push his ideological agenda and deny funds for groups fighting to prevent AIDS through contraception education is criminal.   We're facing a crossroads here everyone.  Are we going to back to an age where scientists are viewed as heretics and the gospels are taken for law?  Are we going to let one scientifically unproven ideology take over in the textbooks given to children?  Especially now when AIDS awareness and education initiatives among young people are at their lowest since AIDS started getting attention?  There are resurgences in younger populations, and we need to step-up education efforts and include realistic (not idealistic) methods for prevention.  Did I mention that Texas has the fifth-highest rate of teen pregnancies in the nation?  So much for ABC.   urlLink http://gbgm-umc.org/health/hivfocus/focus018.cfm

      So, I get back from lunch today. This is the first actual lunch break I've taken in over a week, since I've been bogged down with this stupid project that I won't get into. I think all 3 people who read this know about that anyway.  So I get back from lunch and unlock the office door and notice that the overhead flourescent light in my office is on. I never use this light unless I absolutely have to since it causes a terrible glare and makes a horrible buzzing noise. I have a desk lamp, and a window, and unless it's unusually dark outside, I don't use the light. Well, the light was on when I got back from lunch, so I know someone was in my office while I was out to lunch. Joe is on vacation, our student worker is in England and our temp worker doesn't come in until 2pm.  I check around to see if anything is missing and I pray that my iPod is still in my bag. It is. I do notice that my cell phone is missing. Much to my  urlLink hubby's  dismay, I don't use my phone very often at all and I rarely carry it with me. I have the 20 minute per month plan, and I rarely use that much. Needless to say, my phone is usually resting in one of two states: 1) dead in my bag because I haven't used it or charged it for a month or 2) sitting in my office charging. Not today.  See John, there is something to be said for never using your cell phone - I know exactly when the last time I touched it was, so I know exactly when it went missing.  Here's the kicker - I call Sprint and they tell me there were calls made after the day I know I last had it. 92 calls between July 31 and today. They're crediting me the minutes but that's beside the point. Anyone connecting the dots? The phone was not stolen today. Someone not only stole my phone on or around July 31st, but someone was in my office again today.  I filed reports with security and CPD and explained to Security that not only was my phone stolen last week, but someone was in my office this afternoon. I don't know about you, but that doesn't sound like an after-hours sticky-fingered cleaning person to me.  Needless to say, I'm a bit creeped out. I can't wait to get my next Sprint bill so I can call the numbers that were called by my phone and tell them that their friend who called them from that number is a thief.  sigh

      I can't take credit for this one. This is from my good friend Joe F, but I wanted to share it since he makes a good point.   1.  Kerry makes a very good speech at the convention  2.  Next day, Pakistan announces the capture of a "very important" Al Qaeda member (even though he was captured the Sunday before and, as reported in the New Republic, the Bush administration had put pressure on Pakistan to make a significant capture timed for the week of the convention).  3.  The following Sunday, new terror threats come out.  4.  Monday morning Zogby polls show Kerry with over 300 electoral votes.  5.  Then we learn that the data opon which the warnings were based were obtained in 2000 and 2001.  6.  Now this (from CNN)  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- First Lady Laura Bush, New York Governor George Pataki and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited the headquarters of Citicorp ( C) on Monday, a day after Homeland Security officials issued a terrorist alert for the financial company's offices, Cable News Network reported.  Citicorp was one of several financial institutions that the government said could be a target of an al Qaida terrorist attack. It was the first time warnings were issued for specific sites in the U.S. The other locations include the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) in Newark, N.J., and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington. Amid tight security, Bush, Pataki and Bloomberg sat among hundreds of Citicorp employees in the atrium of the headquarters facility, CNN said.  A major terrorist threat....and Bush send his wife there?!? Anybody else want to argue that these warnings were not politically motivated?   Oh, and if you have time for a frightening read, go there's a great article on electronic voting systems in the Nation  urlLink here . Very scary stuff. No recounts, opportunities for fraud galore, no voter trust. I think we need the U.N. to monitor our election this year.
