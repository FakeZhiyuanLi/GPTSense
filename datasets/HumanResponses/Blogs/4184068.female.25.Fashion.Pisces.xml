      There's a song by Evanescence, Tournequet... And I'm commenting on it because I feel it describes my faith life...  I tried to kill the pain But only brought more ~ my human nature tends to make me forget faith and just control... which usually gets me in deeper crap than I was in originally.  I lay dying and I'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal I'm dying praying bleeding and screaming am I too lost to be saved am I too lost? ~ I think about this a lot- the things I've done in my life, am I too far gone to be saved... I never understood how some christians can say no matter what, they're saved and going to heaven. That to me is carte blanche to live a hedonistic life and at the end of the day say "oops! I'm sorry"... now let me in the gates"... there has to be some reprocussions in the next life that are a result of what you've done... and at what point (if any) are you just so lost that you can't be saved?  Do you remember me Lost for so long Will you be on the other side Or will you forget me ~ Another question I have... what will I see on the other side? Will I see the diety I hold as my Saviour (which is Jesus Christ... my personal belief)? How long do I have to wait in the train station of purgetory? Or even worse, will I be completely cut off in hell?  My God, my tournequet Return to me salvation My God, My Tournequet Return to me Salvation My wounds cry for the grave My soul cries for deliverance Will I be denied Christ Tourniquet My suicide ~ The confusion I feel about what I've done (my wounds), make me so guilt ridden that I do want that part of my life to die, but my infantile faith (soul) wants to rest comfortably in that I will be delivered from the maelstrom.

      Body issues. All women (yes, ladies, ALL) have some sort of issue with their body at one point. I'm a big girl, no doubt about that... and I'm fully aware of the fact that just because an article of clothing is in your size doesn't mean it FITS. However, I've been indirectly taught from a very early age that I'm abnormal because I carry much more flesh than most... my mom and sister are small women... but I'm built (and look like) my dad. To spare you (and myself, somewhat) from this becoming a woe-is-me-I-don't-want- to- be- fat- anymore sob story, let's just say that yes, I want to loose weight. I have absolutely no intention of being THIN... I'm simply not built to be- but I want to be healthy... I may have perfect blood pressure and no diabetes or thyroid syndromes, BUT, I may in the future. I think that explains my borderline (read: just shy of stalking) obsession with Anna Nicole, Marilyn Monroe and Kelly Clarkson. These women were (are) not THIN, but they have beautiful, fully functioning, healthy bodies. Especially Anna Nicole. Granted, I'm not in the financial position to shell out $18 every 15 days for Trim Spa, hire a personal trainer and nutritionist... lord knows I wouldn't still be big if I did. I can't hate on Anna because she's endured a lot of stuff since her late husband died. But IMHO, the 88 year old geezer knew what he was getting into with her... she would be with him for financial stablity and little more. Anyway, she had to be ridiculed in the press for anyone to pay attention. I remember reading a particular diatribe that stated that she was a waste of a great beauty (paraphrased). What in the world?! If I have a pretty face, am I WASTING it being big?  Marilyn Monroe- By far the most recognized beauty of this century. Ask anyone in my generation who Ursela Andress or Raquel Welch were and you may get a blank stare until you mention the movies they were in (Dr. No and 1 Million Years BC, respectively). But say the name Marilyn Monroe and everyone knows. I personally have never met anyone that didn't think she was the epitome of sex and beauty. I was reading another blog (which was an "I'm fat self pity party") that argued that Marilyn was a size 12, which translates to a 16 now [not true- her measurements were 37-23-36, roughly a medium, size 8/10 on Victoria's Secrets site] but I think the bigger point is that she wasn't thin, but everyone wanted/would want a piece of her.  Now, contemporary to my generation- Kelly Clarkson. I was so pissed off when Simon Cowell(sp?) said she needed to loose weight because she didn't look like a pop star. The woman is a size 10, at most? If I get down to a size that small, do believe I will be walking about as if I were the hottest thing since sliced bread. She seems to portray herself as confident in her size. Good for her.  Anyway, I know it seems I'm projecting my wishes on ideals of others, and perhaps I am, but I have no other place to look. Most of my friends haven't had to deal with weight (yet- wait until they pop a few out), or are big themselves. I gave up a long time ago on being a thin woman (ie Faith Hill), because I'm simply NOT a small framed person. I will always have meat on my bones... but sometimes damnit, I want to strut in a two piece without hearing snickers or whispered commentary...  I guess this is turning into self pity, so I'll leave on that note.

      The scandal today brought about a thought.  I'm not completely agnostic.  I know there is a God, and my idea of God is a Christian view, however, I have an issue with churches... CHURCHES, not God.  There's a diffrerence.   I've spent the past while searching for a church.  The first visit is ok, it's all new... then after you attend for a while, a question of tithe comes in.  Not that I'm cheap, but Jesus sat on rocks, so can you.  You do not need to drive a chromed out Hummer (yes, there is a pastor here in town that has one).  I'm all for attaining all you want in life, but not when it's on someone else's dime.  Yes, judgemental, but bugger off- this is my blog.  So, will I find a church that I feel at home in?  We'll see.  Changing gears, I came across a story that I find pathetic.  A girl is living with her boyfriend.  AND HIS MOTHER!  Unless she is an invalid, there is no reason why a grown man's mama is living with you when you have a live-in.  I don't think I could live with anyone unless I'm married to them, but I know my mother-in-law will certainly NOT be living with me unless she is unable to live independantly, and ONLY if she can let us have our separate "married life".  On top of that, this girl finds a suspect wrapper in her bathroom, and they do not partake in protective measures (so to speak- use your imagination)... but she said she wouldn't come right out and accuse him of cheating because she didn't have any proof.  Do you need to walk in on another girl on your man's "business" to have proof?  It may be circumstancial, but odds are- HE'S CHEATING ON YOU!  And then today, find out that she kicked him out of the house and he started calling him names and that he lied when he said he wanted to marry her... ummm, are you suprised?  He's gettin the cow for free, and he outright said he is ashamed to go on dates with you... that shoulda been the clue. He's living in your house and treats you like crap... that's when it's your fault for tolerating it.  Ok, sorry.  Long rant... but women that let themselves be door mats (or on the flipside- control their entire life) RUIN men, to the point that when I'm ready for a relationship, a man is SO distorted that he's unable to see ME... he's too afraid I'm gonna be like the last one.  It's not fair to the few of us that are good women (notice I didn't say perfect... sometimes good is misconstrued with perfect) because we have to deal with the ruins to build something new... that's too much work, especially if the wreckage isn't my fault.

      Doubt anyone is gonna find this... Then again, J found a blog from an unnamed former coworker of ours...  Oh well.  We're so slow at work right now.  I love my job (cough cough)... let me go back... I work in mortgage during the week to pay the bills while I work on my makeup artistry business.  I can't get real far with that until I finish (read: start) cosmetology.   With that slowness comes this blog...  I don't want to constantly go from website to website, considering we're not completely supposed to be on here... kind of the mentality of "don't let anyone see you"... this whole company is a bunch of contradiction.  BUT, they sign my paycheck, so I won't complain any further.  I'm getting SO excited about my trip on the 20th to see my mom's family.  Don't get me wrong, I'm as Southern as they come without being born here, but things are just SO different up there in New England, from the accent to the seafood (FL CANNOT COME CLOSE) to something as miniscule as the water (mountain water is the best!).  It's a comfort though, because my grandfather's people are some country, farm people bumpkins, so I fit right in.  The town my grandfather lives in is SO small.  If you mapquest his house, the result is all tan with two thin grey lines... and NOTHING ELSE!  Should figure, seeing as how he lives on 32 acres.  I'm excited to see my Aunt Chris also.  She and my uncle George are just super laid back, really cool people.  And I really look up to her because she lost 70 something pounds and has kept it off for something like 10 years now.  She and I are gonna work out together... Should be fun.  Keep me from going overboard with my grandmother's cookie recipes.  I'm out of things to say.  I'm sure I'll see something in the news or on some seedy talk show to write about soon.
