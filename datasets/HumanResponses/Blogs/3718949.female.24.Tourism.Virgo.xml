      Well I had never heard of this whole blog thing until recently.  It is kind of different...but cool.  It is sometimes good to let it all flow out...even if it is typed words posted on the internet.  So I am ready to try something new and see if I like it.  A little about myself...I am married to a wonderful guy who just happens to be working in Afghanistan right now.  He took a job cooking over there for the military through a private company.  His contract is for 13months and he has only been over there a month so far.  This is a whole new thing for me to get used to...we have never really been apart and we have been together for almost 11 years.  I am a graduate of a Hotel and Restaurant Management program and am now working at the Hyatt hotel and the University of Calgary Banquet Department.  Right now neither of my jobs are fulfilling and I am constantly on the lookout for something to challenge me.  So far I have found nothing.  I am sure in future posts i will dive into more about myself but for now thats what I'll say.    About my husband in Afghanistan.  I am so worried about him being over there.  I have not watched the news since he has left in fear that I am going to see something that will scare me even more.  I am still not positive why this was an experience that he HAD to do.  I know that life is about experiences I just wish what he wanted to do was safer and it involved the both of us.  The main motivation for him going was money.  He is a real provider and the price was right for him.  He wants to be the breadwinner and for the last few years I have been earning more than him.  The other reason that I think it was important for him to go was to make his father proud.  His dad was in the military and was on a number of peacekeeping missions and I think there was a sense of following in dads footsteps going on.  Whatever the reason he is there and I am here.   I am so extremely lonely here.  It is very hard being apart from someone that has been such a huge part of your life for such a long period of time.  We do talk through messenger and email often but it is just not the same.  I am still left with that lonely feeling even after we have just finished talking.  My friends have been supportive although I believe that they find it hard to see what I am going through.  i long to be able to talk to them openly and honestly but somehow see it as a sign of weakness to tell other people that I am hurting and that I need them.  I see them being busy and think that I shouldn't bother them.  All of my life I have had friendships in which there is a strong friendship although I always feel that I am lacking that one person that I can talk about anything with...that I lose my inhabitions around...my husband is that to me but I do not have someone whom I am in a non commited relationship with.  I think that is also a reason I miss him so very much because I have that with him but not with anyone else.  I always hear of people saying that they tell their best friends everything.  I don't even know if I have a best friend.  I have many dear friends but I sometimes hesitate to call someone a best friend for a fear of rejection.    I talked to my husband this morning on messenger.  It was the first time that we have argued...virtual argument...since he has been gone.  It was so extremely stupid too...mostly because typed words don't always come across the way you intend them too.  I was really upset because I felt as though we had not connected in a really long time.  I hadn't recieved any emails and he was never online...okay it was only a couple of days...but I was lonely and I look forward to hearing from him one way or another everyday.  Anyways through email I made a date to meet on messenger.  I got up early and went online and he didn't come on till 30 minutes after the time I said...it was not a big deal but then he typed that he had forgot...I tried to type a joke about him already forgetting about me and it ended up not coming across as a joke and we ended up arguing the whole time....arghhh...it was so frustrating...I don't want to argue...I miss him so much I don't want to argue with him.  I think it was that we were both frustrated...oh well we will talk again soon and it will be all good.  Anyways that is enough for today...I will try to keep posting however I am an extrovert and keeping a journal has never seemed to work for me...but I am trying new things
