      Its had been long since i last write in Blogspot. It is because i am busy in camp. Life have been ok for me. Lots of things have change since the arrival of the new commander. He restricts canteen breaks and the use of sport facilities at night.&nbsp; There was a blackout in our toilet last night. I gotta got to upstairs to bath.   Anyway, enough about camp. I called F that night. I am so glad to hear F's voice. We only talk for a short while though as F is busy in work.&nbsp;I am just glad that F is fine. Haha! I told my friend that i am gonna wait for F for 3yrs. He says i am too silly to wait but i will wait anyway. I wanna be with F.   Hmm...a person whom i lost contact with finally msg me. I am quite happy. He is my God Bro who i care about alot. He is a nice person. Glad he is fine and hope to catch up with him soon.  I am on Off till Sun so i would be writting blogs when i am free. I really like blogs because it let me express myself and stuff. I feel better and good to have this source of expressing my feeling as i seldom share problems with friends. I just don't wanna bother them with my problems.  Gotta stop&nbsp; here for now.  &nbsp;

      Good morning Blogger, Let me 1st talk about the day b4 when i go for movie with my bros. We watch Brotherhood. It is a very touching and sad story which is worth watching la. Although it is very bloody and stuff. After we watch the movie, we went home and rest as its already midnite. Sometimes, gathering like that do help in strengthening the relationship of our family as we are all busy and seldom have time to be together.  I went out yesterday for haircut and walk around. F seems to be missing again without sms or news. I tink F is busy again. I should understand and continue to wait. I am very determine to wait. As the old saying goes, " Good things are worth waiting for". Actually i was very sad yesterday morning but a good friend of mine call and talk to me. I feel much better as what he says seems to have meaning to it. Hmm...if u r reading this, i wanna thanks you.  Last nite i did enjoy myself, i was walking around Chinatown and came across a mini concert and i sit down n watch. It is very entertaining and i enjoy it alot. The singer although is not very famous has a good voice. The host also have a sense of humour which also sort of cheer me up.&nbsp;  I also met some friendly tourist who is from Burma and Indonesia. They talk to me and we had dinner together at a Thai stall.&nbsp;Basically, yesterday is a not bad day for me. &nbsp;

      Today is quite a happy day for me. Finally, i receive F's sms. I send F a sms saying i miss F. Then i receive F's reply finally. F asks me what my plan. I told F i wanna meet often if F got time or i will wait if F no time. F says&nbsp; dunno how long can i wait. I say i can wait no matter how long.   I am just so glad that F reply. F says will only be free after studies which will b around 3yrs. Its ok. I can wait. It may sound foolish but F is all that i want.   I went out with my campmates for dinner. We ate at Sakura restaurant. The food is very nice. I like it. We had a good time. I just reach home and starts to blog. I am quite tired though. Tomorrow, i will go out with my brothers in the evening. We gonna watch a movie.   Thanks God that F reply. Hope F will not overwork since F is very busy. Lord, Please bless F with good health.  &nbsp;

      I am finally back after a long tough week. I have been through armour familisation. It is quite dry n bored but in the end i did learn something. I learn about armour tactics and etc. Life is not that bored also. I been playing soccer this few days in camp. I scored a few goals and is nicknamed star striker by a few people who is impressed with my scoring.   Today, i play in the field with my platoonmates against other platoon. I scored&nbsp;a goal in&nbsp;each half but i am very tired. Those goals are deal to good vision and assist by teammates. I also got scolded for being too fanciful. Hahaha!   I feel abit sad also. It seems that there is a gap between me and my 2IC. We used to be very close friends but i dunno why. I also just&nbsp;got&nbsp;a news. I am&nbsp;being post&nbsp;for a recce course. It is a 7 weeks course. I heard that it is gonna be tough but&nbsp;I will let nature take its course though. No point worrying as i got more things to worry about. Yup...i still thinking and missing F.   F seems to be so busy and seldom sms me. I feel lonely and abit sad. I wanna cry but i can't. I went out for Night Off on Tuesday because my friends want me to but i didn't really enjoy as i am thinking of F. My friends know about it and they try to cheer me up. I don't know how long more can i bear with this before i broke down. I try very hard to think positively.   Life just sucks without F. Hope F is fine....  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I am missing that person again! I try so hard to keep myself busy so as to not to think of tat person. Lets call tat person F. I just can't stop thinking about F. Life really sucks without F's news. All I wanna know is that F is happy and safe. I don't ask for much.  &nbsp;  I wake up very early today as i kept on thinking and can't sleep well. I went online to check emails and&nbsp;then in the afternoon, i went out alone. I walk here and there, hoping i could bump into F but i didn't. Then i went home. I am so sad. Is heaven playing a fool with me or what? Why can't i be with the person i love and desire? I am sincere and truthful.  &nbsp;  I really hope my true feeling will touched F&nbsp;one day.  &nbsp;  God, i dun blame you for anything. I just wanna pray to you everyday that F is fine n happy.  I will be going to camp tonight so i will&nbsp;write my next journal probably on Friday as i am having Off.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I am sitting infront of a computer now typing down my feelings. I am feeling very down now. I am supposed to attend somebody's birthday party but i didnt go. I feels very bad but i am too tired to go after a long day in the camp. Hope that person will understands me.  &nbsp; I am missing that person again. Someone who i likes. I have been waiting for&nbsp;the sms or call which never seems to come. I feel lonely and sad especially on raining days. Why can't i be with someone who i like so much? When can i touched that person? I really don't know! I am so tired about life. I feel like taking a long break. Sigh!  &nbsp; Maybe only in my dreams can we be together.&nbsp;I will wait and i am still waiting for that person as i promise. Gotta sleep already! &nbsp; Nitez Blogspot

      It has been a long week for me. I am quite sad that day as F msg saying F is attached with someone else. I was so lose and down but after a day, i am fine again. I gotta move on and not stop there. I done alot of things. Now I am attached also to K. K is a nice person who cares and love me. We like each other and things seems to be working out well between us.  I am very glad to have K as my stead. I will never hurt K or be unloyal to K. I really hope our relationship will be forever till old. K is the only person that make me change alot. I starts to eat vegetables and quit smoking. All because of K. I love you alot, K. You are the right one i am waiting for i guess. Going to see K again soon. haha!
