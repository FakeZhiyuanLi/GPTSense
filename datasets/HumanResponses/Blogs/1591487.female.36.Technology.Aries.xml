      It's all happening, really. Reality TV, knitting, a lengthy diatribe about work. What a week! No wonder I'm exhausted, I really need a PA to help me out with these things.  Today, I'm counting my blessings, it is, after all Friday and a whole weekend of wonder awaits. Although I'm most excited about the prospect of sleep and perhaps a thunderstorm or two.  But as Sandra often says, there's no guarantee of fun in life.

      It's fortunate that I don't own any firearms.  No, no, I'm not some violence-loving, freaked out psychopath. It's just that I work on a Helpdesk.  Well, not ON a Helpdesk, I AM the Helpdesk. Apparently.  Once, when I did an Auslan sign language course, we had to sign what we did for a job.  Suffice to say that signing 'help' and 'desk' was somehow interpreted as 'furniture maker' by the instructor.  I should have known then that working on a Helpdesk is not actually a real job.  A real job involves doing something useful, creating good in the world, making something constructive, seeing some sort of result at the end of the day. Isn't it?  Are there any jobs like that left? I'm thinking only if you work at Arnotts making the biscuits.  On the other hand, my job involves gauging the temperament of every single person I speak to. It's never just a question of 'having an IT problem'.  It's more a question of 'which personality am I today'?  Take one of the more popular requests I receive regularly in the course of my work day, for example 'My account is locked'.  This could mean any number of things;  'If you don't unlock my account NOW! I'm going to reach over and poke you in the eyes because if I don't get into my computer the email my boss is expecting me to write to our customer about how bad our programming is I will blow a blood vessel'.  'My account is locked because I'm a dumb-arse who can't remember the password I set for it five minutes ago. Also, can you please tell me where I sit again?'  'My account is locked, Minion Woman. Fix it now, or I will report immediately to your superior the glaring lack of IT skills you demonstrate on a daily basis'  'My account is locked, but I don't really care. I'm so not into being a software engineer right now, I'm making indie films with my brand new Sony Digicam with built-in MP3 player.  That's why I've come to see you from the complete opposite side of the building when I could have phoned you. On my way back I'll stop and chat with seven other people, stop at the vending machine and then maybe come back because by then I would have forgotten what I came down to see you for. Do you like my hair?'.  But it's not all bad, sometimes, just sometimes, in those few and far-between, glorious moments in a workday when you actually perform the task you are employed to do, when someone says 'My account is locked' and means 'My account is locked' and when you unlock it, and when they say 'Thankyou'.  Well, it makes it all worthwhile, doesn't it?  On those days, I really need to resist leaning over the Helpdesk, untangling my headset so that I don't garrotte myself, and give the account-locked person a big hug.  I wonder if Arnott's has any vacancies in it's Tiny Teddies divison?

      I feel that I'm boring people with my knitting obsession.    I can't help it, but dammit my scarf is glorious. And now I'm onto glorious scarf number two!  Clearly, there has been a miraculous revolution in yarn technology which has created a whole new genre of funky knitting fun.  And goodness me, haven't I jumped on that bandwagon.  I also feel that I  now need to say sorry to those people to whom I have turned down social engagements in the past few weeks with some flimsy excuse, but in reality it's because I'm knitting.  There, I've said it. I prefer knitting to socialising.    What's happened to me?  I know what's happened to me, I've fallen into the 'craft sphere'.  Me? Doing craft? Can you believe it? How guilty do I now feel about the scoffing at the 'craft people' and making a face at the ones who said 'I made it myself'.  When now, that person is me.  Me, who spent all of yesterday wishing and hoping that someone would complement me on my scarf which, after wearing it all morning, even though I didn't feel cold, then after sweating it out, nonchalantly leaving it 'draped' over the back of my chair and making sure that I kept swivelling around so that people could see it in its full glory.  When finally someone did say something I didn't even let them finish before saying, a little too shrilly  'I made it myself!'.  But don't think I failed to notice when one of the hapless bystanders gave me the 'craft' face.  The face that I used to make, the face that says, 'Help yourself to having enough spare time on your hands to make shit'.  Why don't you get a life'.   But I didn't care.  I'm a craft person now. I can stinkin' knit a life if I want.

      Why do I persist in watching reality television? Because it's there. And because the compulsion to watch others humiliate themselves for the masses is just to much to resist.  Also because it makes me feel superior.  All good reasons, don't you think?  Not that I feel the need to justify my television viewing habits to anyone, but it seems that some seem to cast aspersions on those who do indulge in trash TV.  Oh, cast away then I say.  I love it.   Also, I feel it brings people together.  Making sure you regularly view at least one reality television show allows you to converse with a myriad of people from hairdressers, people in shops and the canteen lady.  And even, once in a while, with my own colleagues. I won't go into the weirdness just yet, of the dilemma that is conversing with my various workmates, that's for another time.  Reality TV - it's the new social lubricant.  Try it sometime.

      Goodness me, it's here, my blog.  Words cannot express my thanks to the lovely  urlLink Cousin Peter  who did such a splendid job in designing this particularly beautiful page. All I can say is Peter, you're a dead-set legend.  I think it's fair to say also that I look so much better morphed into a creepy, cat-nosed person that I'm seriously considering surgery to make it a reality.  I've become more and more accepting of surgical enhancement lately and let's say I'm considering my options.  But I digress, well, actually I don't, because this is the point of a blog isn't it? Digression, discussion and narcissism - the blog is a forum for all these things, isn it?  And good heavens, I will certainly be taking advantage of it.

      The small-talk reserve is getting smaller. And I think it's because I've been rattling around a big house by myself for the past week.  It's amazing. I've enjoyed the solitude immensely, but it's done nothing for my social skills.  And just think, as single occupier households are growing in numbers, there may be more and more people out there who might actually be forgetting how to converse.  It's kind of scary, but also secretly a bit of a relief, possibly. :)  Maybe the future will be silent. Sshh.   Of course, there's always the dilemma where you are so used to saying things out loud without thinking of the consequence when you live by yourself, that there's an inherent danger in doing this in public.  I need to check that the brain>mouth editor is engaged a lot more than I used to.   Also, I've been watching far too much pay television.  It's not good. I'm getting RSI from changing channels, and not just in random order. I need to start at 1 and keep going just to make sure I'm not missing something really good.  Fortunately, I never am. Although that doesn't stop me watching.  Ironically, someone gave me a notepad today with 'Things to Do' written on the top. In first place I wrote 'get a life', in second place I wrote 'find another job', in third place I wrote 'go cold turkey on Foxtel'.

      Today I'm wearing the same shirt that I wore yesterday. And no-one's noticed. Which is good. But then again I work with boys, who I feel, don't actually care about these things. Or maybe they have noticed but feel too embarrassed for me to say anything.  If that's the case, then they must be embarrassed for me for much of the time, as they hardly say anything to me, anyway.  Although to be fair we did have a brief conversation this afternoon about the merits of movie violence.  And I did comment the other week to one of my co-workers that we never have conversations that last longer than 10 minutes, he brought in a stop watch the following Monday.   We made it to 15 minutes, however, I mentioned that this was because the pressure was on and it felt forced.  Do you think that you can sustain a relationship with someone with which you have an average of two conversations a day that last only 10 minutes each? I'm not sure, because I quite like him. Perhaps it would be good practice for when we have been married for years and years, we'd have no place to go but up in terms of conversation time? It's a thought.  Anyway, I'm wearing the same shirt because I'm currently house-sitting and trying to bring the whole wardrobe with you is virtually impossible.  I never plan what I'm going to wear on a given day and accessorising is definitely on a whim. Has watching too much Video Hits over the weekend inspired me to wear the big hoop earrings today? Or shall I be demure and not wear any earrings? Shall I wear furry scarf no. 2 or shop bought scarf no. 27?   When you don't have these choices at hand dressing is limited. So I'm having to improvise with the things I could fit into one washing basket.  Clearly I didn't calculate enough underpants for the duration of the stay too.  I really should think these things through.

      Clearly, I have nothing to say anymore. To anyone, or anything. My small-talk reservoir has dried up.   I think, and think and basically, I got nothing.  This is why I've always disliked parties.  I love the concept of a party, the organisation, the food, the careful selection of the music. But the reality is quite different.  Getting a group of disparate strangers to stand around chit-chatting is a lot more difficult than you first think.  I just can't do it anymore.  The thing though, is that in a desperate attempt to be a 'party person' I end up doing the most talking, however, the talking consists of an endless barrage of questions from me, and then, not actually listening to the answer because I'm inside my brain desperately trying to come up with the next question in a vain attempt to keep the conversation flowing.  It's quite a sad spectacle to watch.  I'm sure people are relieved when I get up to get a drink or attend to some alleged 'urgent' incident in the kitchen.  Sometimes I just go to the toilet not because I have to, but just to get away.  Isn't that awful? Surely I have the makings of a sociopath.    This is why I like functions with a focus, rather than the aimless 'party' or 'get together'. This is why I love a quiz night, or a games night, or a poker game. You need a focus, something to get excited about. Competition does it for me. And if there's a reward involved, then even better!   And with that thought in mind, here comes the Christmas season! It's not as far as away as you think.

      I think I must be getting old. Old and tired. Saturday night at work and I'm flipping out because someone is sitting my spot.  And then everyone is so nice and helpful and I'm just getting crankier and crankier because someone is sitting in my 'normal' workstation. What a nut!   I feel it might be the lack of chocolate, or possibly, cheese in my life.  Clearly, being Mrs Routine is quite limiting.  I should just go with the flow and chill, shouldn't I? Big deal, right? I should take my own advice (which sadly, I never seem to do) and remember what I keep saying to The Nieces; 'Some children have nothing, some children have no shoes'.  Once when I said that to Niece No 2, she said 'But I don't care about those children'.  Their Catholic education has a lot to answer for.  Did I mention that Niece No 1 is currently obsessed with Hilary Duff? She's 7 for heaven's sake! It's creepy. I told my sister not to take her to see 'The Lizzie McGuire' movie, but no, did she listen to me?   Now, she's got a 7 year old going on 17 year old mooning about the house waiting for Christmas so she can get the latest Hilary Duff CD.  I don't think I can forgive my sister for encouraging mainstream cinema and music tastes in her children.  It's just not right.  Finally, I quite like the way I seamlessly diverted this blog from my own shortcomings to those of my family members.

      I'm still knitting, by the way.  I'm onto scarf number three, silvery furry wool striped with black, it's not quite what I'd imagined, it looks like a bit of a drag queen's footy scarf.  It will be different at least. But hey, you need to experiment with these things.  The other night I made a new compilation tape for my car.  Every now and then I get the urge to put together songs based on a theme for listening in my car (I don't actually have a CD player in my car, just an old fashioned tape deck/radio).  It started off being an 80s nostalgia tape with a bit of Spandau Ballet to start off with, however, the choice of songs degenerated into a diva-festival with Dusty Springfield, Lena Horne and Shirley Bassey. Go figure.  Then, I felt the need to include a bit of Alanis Morrissette, Indigo Girls and The Smiths.  So, don't be alarmed if you see me driving, wearing my drag queen footy scarf, singing at the top of my lungs, and then five minutes later down the road, wiping the the tears from my eyes feeling slightly depressed after hearing 'How Soon is Now'. :)

      I really must get rid of all my magazines.  Hi, I'm Goss and I'm a magazine junkie.  More and more parts of my house are slowly being overtaken by so many copies of 'Table' and 'Food Ideas' that one room is beginning to resemble some creepy, out of control dentist's waiting room.  I don't know why I need all those copies of Martha Stewart Weddings, in fact I don't know why I even bought them - with no wedding anywhere in sight either in the planning or attending stages.  But I think I can be forgiven for them as the lure of Martha is too much to resist.  It was difficult enough going cold-turkey with the Martha Stewart Living magazine, so many times lurking in the newsagency aisles picking up the copies, putting them back, picking up, putting back.  I had to break the Martha magazine habit, it was hard but I did it.  It doesn't stop me going  urlLink here  though every five minutes though.  Sort of like an online methodone program.  I don't know, do I really need to keep four years of back issues of Good Taste? All those dinner parties I'm having  - not!  And surely, I can't possibly need a recipe for pumpkin risotto from the August 1998 issue when I can easily look it up on the net, or perhaps find it in one of the myriad of cookbooks I own.   But it's the  possibility  of things that makes me hold onto those copies of food and wedding magazines, I'm sure.  And besides, it's better than being addicted to Vicodin, eh?

      I'm an optimist when it comes to parking I don't know why, because I'm certainly not one in other areas of life.  I always feel that I will be able to find a carpark close to where I actually want to go, but it seems I never do. It's this eternal optimism about parking that's costing me a fortune in petrol, I'm sure.  In the end I always end up parking quite a way from where I want to go and actually the walk does me a world of good.  But you never know when that person with the great park is going to leave, do you?   Also, I feel guilty about buying the quantity of nuts they don't have a price for.  At the place where I buy nuts they have prices for 100g, 250g, 500g and 1kg.  I always buy my nuts in 200g lots.  I don't know why.  The nut lady never seems to mind, though.  It's weird, I'm thinking I could always eat another 50g of nuts, couldn't I? They'd never go to waste.  That's about the extent of it today - yep, nuts and parking.

      You would think the coughing season is passed us, but apparently not.  A number of people I know have heralded the arrival of spring coughing their guts out as the remnants of various dreaded lurgies wrack their bodies.  Here is a small poem by Anne Sexton  I have recently read, memorised and loved, I hope it makes them feel a little better.   As it has been said: Love and a cough cannot be concealed. Even a small cough. Even a small love.  And no, I don't have a cough.

      Blogs, they're interesting but you wouldn't want to write one would you?  I've been spending an inordinate amount of time reading blogs lately and I've discovered that my fascination for minutiae is insatiable.   But I particularly love the detail about what people eat and when.  Being such a stickler for routine myself,  I think that basically I'm living vicariously when I read about people eating all sorts of things at all sorts of times.    Wacky young people living on the edge, eating chocolate and fried things at all hours,  keep it up! An old woman depends on you for entertainment, you know.  I know why I love reading about the small things, because the older you get the more you realise that's what life is.  It's the succession of small things, some good, some bad all come together to make the big picture.   Life - it's just like knitting, really.

      Up here, the sounds are different.  I can hear the wind in the eaves, I can hear the clatter of the keyboards as people actually do work.  Some people are laughing, which is a nice sound. Although it sounds more as if it's the nervous laugh of someone who might be under quite a bit of stress. Is that me laughing? No, I'm not laughing.  I know what the sounds are, those of collaboration. That's also a nice sound.  People always say that 'nice' is an insipid word, but I like it. It's 'nice'.  I like my world to be 'nice'. What's the opposite of nice? I think it's 'nasty'.   I think I was nasty today though, when I threw a box of teabags at one of my colleauges.  The tea in the teabags is always nice.

      How did it get to Monday again?  How did it get to be the end of October 2003?  The year has passed so quickly, it's giving me panic attacks. Surely the axis is spinning faster, everyone says so.  My boss was recently on a jury for a murder trial, she said it was a life-changing experience for her, she said that she knew the jury had made the right decision because she slept very well on the night of the verdict.  I think so too.   However, while she was on the jury listening to evidence, it occurred to her that some people have no concept of time. She realised that the value of an hour, a minute, a day is different to different people.  She said that to us, meaning her and me, the value of an hour is very different than to, say, someone who is looking after a child, or someone who does not have the constraints of a structured day to deal with ie. a drug addict.  Or, indeed, a murderer.  And it made me think, so does the day go quicker or slower for them?  An hour used to be so long, but now, it seems an hour is the new five minutes. An hour late is an acceptable time to arrive at a party now, isn't it? An hour TV show isn't even an hour anymore, not even on SBS or the ABC! And who has a full hour for lunch during the day anymore?   Consequently I can't help feeling slightly resentful about the hour that has been taken from me by daylight saving. I know that I will get it back sometime in March next year, however, I could have used it today, if only for a bit more sleep. Would that be a waste though?   Which begs the question, if I had more hours, what would I do with them?   What would you do with the hours?

      I don't understand people who just let their email build up and not read each one as it arrives straight away.   Obviously I don't have anything better to do than to obsessively check whether there is any new email on the server. And boy, am I disappointed when there isn't. This happens about, oh, a million times a day.  Additionally, I'm disappointed when I don't get any Instant Messenger messages either, people should know that I am sitting at my computer waiting to be messaged! Clearly, the reply to an instant message takes any precedence over any actual work being done.  Although I do admit to a certain level of pathos when I send an instant message to someone who is less than three feet away.   I unravelled about a week's worth of knitting the other night, I should have known better than to start knitting to a pattern I knew would not fit me. It seems that patterns are only tailored to Very Thin People living in Thinland.  I could have kept knitting I guess, however, I don't know that many small children who I would feel would like to wear a black jumper with scarlet feathered edges.    I may have to see if I can purchase a Knitting for Lardies pattern book over the net.  There's bound to be one somewhere.  Look! A weekend is looming, which is wonderful.

      The world has shifted.  Do you ever get that feeling? Some small change in life prompts a whole lot of dominoes falling and life shifts plane and things aren't quite what they used to be?   Most people I guess, try constantly to make that happen - most young people, perhaps. But not me, I like my comfort zones - er, der! That's why they're called 'comfort'!  Perhaps this is how the first protozoa felt on the way to becoming a fish or whatever it was that came out of the swamp to eventually become life on earth.  I would have stunk at evolution. Seriously. I would have been the one saying 'no, that's fine, you go on ahead'. I'm quite happy staying here in the middle of the space rock, it's nice here, I know where everything is. But send me a postcard when you make New York City'.  Anyhoo, there's a whole bunch of comfort zones being intruded upon currently, so it's pretty much occupying most of my head space. Which makes for a very dull blog I'm sure, so why don't you go  urlLink here    urlLink   and look at something nice.   Or  urlLink here   urlLink   and learn the words to a lovely song. Go on, then.

      Me and my big stinkin' mouth.  Sometimes, I just don't know when to shut up.  I think I'm getting the 'old woman' syndrome of becoming Mrs Tactless, of thinking that honesty is the best policy, when, of course, I'm old enough and stupid enough to know better.  Again, another blog about work, so tedious, but sorry, I feel the need to be slightly cathartic, if only to make myself feel better.  Today I was told that I would be 'seconded' to another department for approximately six to eight weeks,  'secondment' is another word for being unceremoniously shifted around like a pawn to satisfy some ridiculous concept of 'sfaff management'.    After initially feeling freaked out by the idea - being Mrs Routine, any implication of change sends me round the bend - I eventually felt slightly better after chatting with one of the nice people I will be working with.  As she has gone through a similar process, we both laughed and agreed that yes, we were our respective departments sacrificial lambs being sent to slaughter in order to save the status quo of others in our departments. Anyhoo, dull, dull, dull.  However, after revealing the change to my immediate monkey-boy colleagues it was mentioned as to the reasons why I might have been nominated for the change, and that the reasons were of noble intent to help me out career-wise etc etc, however, I blurted out that I thought I was being used as a pawn, that I can't help but being cynical, that this shift was to save someone else's arse etc etc.  Remember when I said 'brain>mouth editor' needed to be engaged? Well, apparently that didn't seem to be working about half an hour ago.   I really should have just stayed quiet and nodded demurely like a lady.    Why wasn't I sent to finishing school in Switzerland?  It would have saved me a lot of grief.

      I'm in no mood for working today, such lovely weather, the pollen count seems manageable, how delightful!  I almost contemplated driving straight past work this morning and heading onto the Barossa for a lovely lunch in the sun.  It was very tempting, I can tell you.  I'm thinking Christmas, I'm thinking gifts, baking, card-making. I'm thinking - panic.   I think it all started with the David Jones hamper catalogue I've been flicking through. Damn David Jones and it's whole 'Get organised for Christmas early' philosophy.  Christmas 2003 will not consist of icing biscuits until 2am in the morning, wrapping gifts with birthday paper and writing out cards but actually forgetting to give them to people.  By Martha, I will be organised this Christmas!  Although I feel slightly resentful that such a western construct as 'Commercial Christmas' has made me feel this way, even though I know that Christmas is about none of those things ie. biscuits, cards, hampers and that it's fashionable to denigrate any activity associated with 'Commercial Christmas' however,  it is the only time I feel that the excessive use and consumption of fat and sugar in my delicious biscuits is justified.    On a completely different note.	  My new favourite reality TV show is the  urlLink Iron Chef  on SBS.  Those wacky Japanese, such a wonderful healthy respect for the art of preparation and consumption of food.  Apart from that the incomparable English 'commentary' over the top of the real Japanese is rather hilarious and not a little surreal as it's not just plain interpreting but real 'interpreting' ie. acting.  The only negative thing after watching the show is having an enormous hankering for Asian food of any sort, rather than the half a packet of rice crackers I did have which just didn't cut it.

      It all started with wanting to make sure the spelling of the word 'divisiveness' was correct in an email to a friend.  This lead to asking to borrow the dictionary, which then led to the question 'What are you looking up?', which then led to the comment 'Hey, what does 'existentialism' mean?' Which led to the reading out of the definition. Which lead to the discussion 'Am I an existentialist?'   Which lead to the conclusion that you can't be an 'existentialist' and have a job.   The someone said something about the Simpsons and monkeys and the whole existentialist discussion was forgotten.  From the sublime to the ridiculous in the space of half an hour. Don't say to me that philosophy is dead.  Have I mentioned how where I live is now a bit of a craft central?  The most fabulous wool shop called The Yarn Barn has just recently opened up within five minutes walk of my house, and how it has the most beautiful collection of wool and knitting paraphernalia I've ever seen? Clearly, it's a sign that I need to continue with my knitting obsession and that I now need to progress to bigger and better things, such as a jumper or maybe even a beanie.  In addition, another brand new shop called 'Adelaide Beads'  has also just opened up approximately seven minutes walk from my house, selling a wonderful collection of beads and jewellery and trinkets.  Shiny, pretty things all within walking distance!   I'm never leaving home now.   I feel my mother is not as keen on the nearby craft shops as I am.  See 'attitudes to consumerism' in previous entry.

      Yuck! I dislike doing my tax return intensely.  But thank goodness for modern technology, this whole online thing is a bit of a bonus for Mrs Math Challenged such as myself. I do like a inbuilt calculator and little fields that add things up for you.  However, while I feel that life is generally interesting, two things which immediately make my eyes glaze over and wishing that my brain had a secret door to Narnia are superannuation and tax.  I've probably miscalculated all sorts of things and am sure that I'm missing some crucial deduction which could result in a larger refund, but honestly I could care less. It's over for another year and I can cross that hideous chore off my list.  The wardrobe has been done too.  Fortunately, a small disagreement with my mother spurred me onto throw an enormous stuff away, four garbage bags worth.  We always have words when it comes to my blase attitude to consumerism. But you can't blame any post-war immigrant for their attitudes to money.   Count them people, four!   That's terrible, isn't it? To think that I haven't worn four huge bags of clothing, shoes and accessories for more than a year (that was the criteria - it's in all the magazines) made me feel a number of things, ie. I have hideous taste, I have no idea about what to buy, I'm a complete spendthrift who should go and live in a monastery for five years and learn the true value of money.  But I think it's mainly that my whole fashion experience has been shaped by the fact that I have lived within 10 minutes of a Kmart my whole life.

      Crikey! It's the weekend, already! And a long one to boot. How excellent.  I feel the baking urge coming on, so I feel there'll be a bit of that happening, I have a scarf to finish tonight for gift-giving tomorrow. I don't know about this knitting to a deadline deal - it takes the meditative qualities out of the equation, but it's my own fault, so I can help myself.  However the big project is the wardrobe-cleansing project this weekend.  I'm feeling slightly anxious about it because inevitably I have a hard time parting with some clothes.  And there's the whole discovering the ones with the labels still on them, and the ones I've forgotten about because I had to hide them from disapproving eyes when returning home with yet more shopping bags.  There's also the 'I'm sure I'll find something to wear with that', or the 'one day I'll fit into that' or the "surely, that will come back into fashion" lot of clothes.    But this time I'm planning to put my ruthless hat on and go zen on that wardrobe's ass.  There's no room left and I can't keep hanging clothes on door handles and have them go crashing in the middle of the night scaring the hell out of me.  Surely organised people don't live this way.  And really, when I am going to wear a yellow plastic raincoat again?

      It's been four days seven hours since my last blog entry. It's all a bit confessional, isn't it? Well, for a kind of Catholic girl like me it is.   Although I was informed the other day that 'confession' isn't called that anymore, it's called 'reconciliation'. I didn't know that! I feel quite guilty about it actually, not keeping up with the changes in the church, so to speak. Well, there seems to be so few of them, so who can blame me?  I guess it's easy to go on and on about work, when really I should be grateful I have a relatively well-paid job, it can get stressful, but not so much that it infringes on other areas of my life, I don't need to work late, or have horrible managers who harass me about things.   On the whole, I'm fortunate, and outside of my current work area there are good people I deal with. However, (and there is always a however), it's the insidious little cultural things that annoy me the most.  So basically,yeah, today, I am going to go on about work - but just for a little bit.  For example the undercurrent of misogyny I feel have to deal with on a daily basis - it's not overt, however, it is there, in the comments and discussions.   Maybe I'm being over-sensitive, and perhaps in an all-male group dynamic there's no buffer zone as such, so they feel that they can say anything in the name of 'humour'.  But there is a distinct scent of tarring all women with the same brush ie. gold diggers.  Of course, I'm not sure all of the male co-workers feel that way, and again, it might be the group dynamic, however, it's there and it's unsettling at times. I feel have to bite my lip (such an old-fashioned saying, but it's accurate), all in the name of a harmonious work environment.  Weird.   Anyway, no great shakes, I suppose, they can help themselves, and I can always go home at the end of the day, can't I?

      I feel I'm already behind with the Christmas tasks, and it's not even December 1 yet. Where did all this pressure come from? It's madness I tell you.  I'm getting excited about the baking this year though, I'm thinking biscotti and gingerbread.  Although people have already professed their dislike of the gingerbread, even though I'm convinced they ate it last year without knowing what it was.  I'm going to attempt the fudge again, the chocolate one comes out great, but the white chocolate one is always a disaster, I don't know why, must be something to do with the cocoa solids distribution. It's a fine line, I'm sure.  I love the minutiae of cooking!   It's LisaMisa's Christmas extravaganza part-ay this Friday, I've invited all sorts of extranneous people to it. She's so cool and is getting excited about it, but now I'm having second thoughts.   It's that whole party/conversation thing, what happens if they show up and they don't know anyone? And they just stand there, thinking 'why have I come here?'.  And then I'll feel compelled to talk to them the whole night, while the other people who've come and are thinking the exact same thing are also standing there going 'well, this was a complete waste of time, how lame'.  And I'm already trying to think of things everyone has in common and maybe trying to mix and match the people, but then realising that they're all completely different and probably won't be able to stand each other. And then no-one will ever talk to me again.  I really dislike parties.  The toilet better be free a lot of the night, so I can hide in there.

      This point in time, the Rugby World Cup, terrorism, Michael Jackson.   The thing that struck me the most was how small the cup actually is, it's tiny. Although one colleague pointed out that it was being held by a man who could be seven foot tall.  It's a World Cup, it should be bigger. You'd need another five to make a decent set.  Saturday night again, and am waiting for the front page of this esteemed Sunday publication to arrive on my desk, so it can signal the end of another working week for me.  Damn the delays brought on by sports carnivals.    I attempted some Christmas shopping this week, to no avail.  I did buy some things for myself though, although I resisted buying yet another denim skirt, I feel that having four is enough.    It's been a weird week, people stressing around me all over the place, colleagues crying from the stress and having violent dreams. Others confessing all sorts of personal life issues, it's been strange and revealing and fascinating,  I live for that stuff, the humanity, that is, not the suffering. Although some could argue that they are one and the same thing.  It's that time of the year, I guess. It kind of begins around September I think, all the pressure of having to deal with the 'end of the year' I think. People get reflective and think  'what have I done?'.  When really, it's just passed all in a blur of work, sleep, eat, reality television - well, for me it has.  How do you find meaning in between that stuff? I guess it's in the small moments.

      I hope people realise I was joking in the last post about the stalking. Huh, of course I was. No, really, I was joking.  I think the word 'stalking' and indeed, the concept, has become one of those with such an overuse in general conversation that it's meaning has been dumbed down a bit. Stalking is quite a serious issue, 'real' stalking that is, the criminal offence kind.  People seem to use it for all sorts of situations, including just being interested in other people's lives! (god forbid!) I asked someone a question once about whereabouts they lived or some other innocuous comment and the immediate response was 'Are you stalking me?'.  And I've just realised that I've used it myself in a previous post too! Gosh, I'm a hyprocrite.  Okay, I now vow never to use the word 'stalking' in an inappropriate context again.  Anyway, enough of that unpleasantness.  This afternoon, we have been trying to work out ways to put drops in dogs'ears. Lovely colleague, Susan, has  two labradors whom she loves dearly, and fair enough, they're beautiful.  However, the black one has an ear infection which needs drops, but unfortunately is making it very difficult to allow his owners to do this.   Being a bit of clever dog, he's cottoned onto the fact that when both mother and father come out with some treats and a calming voice, that something is up, so makes a bit of run for it. Sadly, the vet wasn't that helpful with tips, so we've resorted to the web and found some useful information.  My suggestion of giving the dog a general anaesthetic each time didn't seem practical, so tonight they're going to try a couple of the tips recommended by the University of Washington State Veterinary School. Good luck!

      I feel there's a song for every occasion.  Today was no exception, unfortunately the song in question was Nelly's "It's Getting Hot in Here".  Stupid song, stuck in my head for the whole day. It was hot, but thankfully, for everyone concerned, no-one took their clothes off.  I'm not sure I'm ready for this immediate transition to summer, why I've still got the quilt on and am wearing the flannellette pyjamas! No wonder I keep waking up in a sweat.  This is why you have seasons, isn't it? Autumn to get you ready for winter and spring to get you ready for summer.  People underestimate the mental energy involved in a seasonal transition.  It's about the clothes, the food, the hair, the hair removal.  It's complex, that's why it's supposed to take three months!  As someone put it to me recently, the penguins clearly have stolen spring and are using it for their evil penguin ways somewhere in the Antarctic, or perhaps, on Granite Island.  Anyway, when the weather is the only thing you have to complain about, then life is pretty good.  And it is generally, except for the ridiculously huge crush I have on a boy at work.  Is it still a crush when you're 35?  Oh no! Maybe it's not! Maybe, technically, when you're 35, it's not a crush anymore, perhaps it's some weird obsessive, stalking neurotic turn by a bitter, unmarried woman?  Nah. It's a crush. I keep sighing a lot and moping about thinking up witty text messages to send..   ..and maybe driving past his house.  ...Or turning up unexpectedly with a cake - or a lasagne...or just phoning and then hanging up when he picks up the phone....    Does anyone know how much those night vision goggle things cost? Are they expensive?....

      This Instant Messaging thing is getting out of hand.  It started off as very useful tool for communication with colleagues in different parts of this vast compound I work in, to answer quick questions, check on pending things etc.  However, I now feel my Instant Messages are becoming 'public domain' with people 'impersonating' other users responding to my messages. How old are we? What's going on? It's ridiculous.  The thing, is that it's making me laugh, and I'm always waiting for the next message.  So unprofessional.  It's such an inappropriate forum for some of the things which are being discussed too.  Surely, there's some way of vetting the things which are said on these applications?   However, the sad thing is that  urlLink Peter  is leaving to go to Japan today, although really we should all be used to him going somewhere after that whole 'moving to Melbourne' deal.  I wish him lots of luck and Japanese fun. He'll be a star in Japan, I feel that he'll end up on some TV show either as a host, or as a regular commentator on the Western perspective to pop culture.  They'll call him Peter-san and have pictures of him on packets of noodles in vending machines.  Bon Voyage, Peter!

      The lure of the smorgasbord was too difficult to resist. The fake chicken and the smoked fish were delicious. As was the wacky mushroom salad with sweet chili sauce? Who would have though to put those two together?  Those buffet chefs must have a hard time trying to come up with something new.  But of course, everyone just makes a beeline for the prawns, don't they? Big deal, so over them.  When you can have the seafood extender! I love that stuff. I never want to know what's in it.  It's delicious.  Sadly, I had to leave dinner early to come to work.  It's difficult to concentrate after a big meal, and I shouldn't really have had that second helping bread and butter pudding and custard.  All those carbs make me sleepy.  Yet another food festival awaits tomorrow, a first birthday party! Apparently there's going to be a puppet show! I'm quite excited about it and will push any children out of the way to get a good spot.  I've had so much birthday cake in the last two weeks, I feel that there'll be a global shortage of sponges and mock cream just because of me.  All that food has clearly dulled any insightful tendency I may have had.  Although many may argue that any insights I have are generally dull.  I blame the cake.

      I've been laughing a lot at  urlLink this   It seems to sum up feelings we all have at the moment, which is excellent and what better way to express them via some lovely craft. It's a shame you can't buy them from Australia, just when we need them most.  Saturday whizzed past in a blur yet again, what with the shopping for mother's birthday present, conferring with my sister on other people's mobile phones because I didn't bring mine, get accosted in the street yet again by the lovely Coralie, who I feel is stalking me (not really, we just keep running into each other at various locations) and then having coffee with her, and then hanging out a bit with the nieces and then going for a walk.    The ladies in the sewing shop were so lovely, I love supporting small local business.  I've made a pact with myself to try and do this more often.  They were so excited that I was buying a sewing machine for my mother's birthday and said what a wonderful gift and hoping that their children would do the same for them. Honestly,  I would have paid ten times more for the thing, just to be spoken about in such glowing terms!   I also ventured into the Yarn Barn again, gosh I love that shop. They had some beautiful cotton. The sign on the door said the shop would be closed for some time in November while the wool lady went to a wool conference.  A wool conference? Imagine that, possibly the only sort of conference where you would have to speak quite loudly so you can be heard over the clatter of knitting needles.  Perhaps they'll talk about compulsive people like me who buy five knitting books from Amazon on Tuesday nights when they should be writing job applications.      I've been thinking a lot of the whole 'opening of the nail salon dream'.  I think that becoming a nail technician would solve a lot of my work-related issues.  Just think, making people feel good, listening to them about their problems, $40, thankyou very much - next! Excellent.    Or opening a  urlLink Baker's Delight  franchise - everyone loves a bun.  But maybe paying someone else to get up at 4am.

      I'm sick of the big-ass spiders hounding my life.  Seriously, I'm over them, and I want them OUT.  The one last night on the ceiling of my bedroom, directly over my head while lying in bed - get the fuck out of here I said. Clearly, at that point my ability to communicate with spiders telekinetically was on 11, because it crawled towards the air conditioning duct and disappeared. However, do you think I could still sleep? I kept waking up every 15 minutes imagining that it had come back again and was crawling over my head.  Asshole spider.  Then, the huge motherfucker on the wall near the toilets at work - YUCK.  I went to the toilets upstairs instead.  And dammit, there's nobody around to get rid of it either. So I guess, I'll be going up and down the stairs quite a bit.  And then there's the one that's living in my stinkin' car.  It's been there for about three months now. It lives in the side mirror, although I"ve never seen it.  I've taken that car through the carwash about ten times, and each time, lo and behold its once again made its intricate web all over my stupid side mirror.  What is the point? What are you planning to catch there, idiotic spider? Another car?   How stupid are these spiders? Really. Charlotte's Web was clearly a load of shit. Now, don't get me wrong, I loved that book and I loved Charlotte, but honestly, a COMPLETE work of fiction.  Tell me, there's a whole fucking world of trees and bushes and plants in parks across the whole world to live in where nobody would bother you, but yet, you choose to make your home in someone else's home who clearly hates your guts and the inevitable is that you're going to get squashed unceremoniously, either by a shoe or a broom, or either have the bejesus sprayed out of you by some hideous chemical.  Surely the spider community would have cottoned by now? Why can't the outdoor spiders tell their friends 'Hey buddy, I wouldn't go in there if I were you'.  Maybe the inside spiders are suicidal and want to be killed? Which would make me feel a lot better, although how would they feel when they encounter the nice people, the pseudo-Buddhists who put them in a jar and then take them outside again.  When this happens, do you think the suicidal spider is thinking 'Oh, man! Now I have to try and get inside all over again, why is this happening to me? I really want to kill myself now!'  What is going on?  I blame the media and hormones in the chicken.

      Well, I wasn't going to write anything until after New Year possibly, but I'm stuck here at work feeling decidely un-Christmassy. I feel I peaked too early with the whole Christmas-spirit thing and now I just feel depleted.  Also, I'm sick of eating.  I know that this is very difficult to believe, but I'm sick of it.  I have had at least one meal out for the past eight days and frankly, I'm so over restaurant/cafe food.  If anyone says the word 'coulis' or 'jus' to me, I think I'll burst into tears.    I really think you can have too much of  good thing, and clearly I've reached my limit.  Even the thought of having one of my beloved mince pies has paled.   I'm hoping that all the food I've eaten in the past week will actually suffice for my energy intake for the whole of 2004 and I won't have to have anything at all for the next 12 months. Think of all the money I'll save.  But I musn't grumble, it's so easy to complain about Christmas isn't it? Such an insane time of year, it's really a time of excess - food, drink, spending, however, the only excess we never seem to have is time.  And really, a few more hours in the day would be the best present of all at this stage.  I've realised that there's a reason to take holidays at Christmas away from the workplace, because the only people who work through Christmas and New Year are the miserable ones, the anti-festive people who have nothing else in their lives. (Of course I do not include all those wonderful people such as doctors, nurses, emergency services, 24 petrol station employees who have to keep the rest of the world going through this time).  I can't help feeling resentful when somebody actually wants work done today.  But really, I only have myself to blame, don't I?   Oh my goodness, maybe I'm one of those people! Argghh!  I am looking forward to a lovely day tomorrow, I am looking forward to a day of R&R on Friday also.    I am a lucky girl, to be looking forward to a lovely Christmas, to be able to have spent time with family and friends during this time.   Okay, I think I've talked myself back into the Christmas spirit! Yay!

      I really should update this more often, eh?  This once a week entry deal is not really using the resources properly is it?  And really it's supposed to be a daily sort of entry like a real diary.  Sadly, I am old enough to remember the 'real diaries', you know, the ones you hold in your hand and write in with a pen, or a pencil.   I loved those diaries, the ones with the lock.  Although, really, what are you writing that needs a lock? Unless you're planning to overthrow the government, or are a terrorist, or a potential mass murderer.  I always felt the lock was unnecessary.  Well, for the things I would write anyway, which really only consisted of 'Today I went to school' or 'I have to lose weight'.  One of my favourite cartoons was one of Robotman - which I have no idea if it's printed anywhere anymore (it was about a robot, funnily enough, with very human traits).  The first cartoon frame was him sitting at a desk with a diary open on the desk.  The second frame was him writing 'Dear Diary', the third frame was him writing 'Today I bought a diary'.  This kind of sums my life in terms of writing any sort of daily account.  But I digress.  Well, LisaMisa's part-ay has been had and was quite tremendous, as it always is. Although the whole 'disparate groups' thing still happened. I guess you can't force people to mingle can you?   I felt though I was running a bit of a party obstacle race, racing from group to group and frantically chatting, in between heating up the party food and wanting to hide in the toilet, and then really wanting to spend the whole time gazing into the eyes of the boy on whom I have a crush.  Which was the whole point of inviting the whole department at work, when really I only wanted him to come along, but thought that might be perceived to be slightly creepy.  In the end I hardly spoke to him at all.  Which is just as well, as I wouldn't have had anything to say.  Who does those sort of things? How pathetic and weird.  Me, that's who does them. Mrs Passive Aggressive, thinking that people might get the hint, but they never do. Hopeless.  Anyway, apparently the caramelised red onion and feta tarts came out a treat, the sausage rolls were apparently quite good and everyone ate the dodgy cold rolls.  Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that people ate stuff but it would have been nice been to try one.    LisaMisa is Mrs Party Queen, really. She's amazing. Everyone loved the candles lining the driveway, the tents, the band. She's a good shindig thrower.  Even though it makes us very tired, in the end, it's all good.   I guess this is not the blog either to dwell on hideous work-land, where the Big Hand Of Retrenchment once again descended on us and resulted in the loss of two co-workers, two very talented boys, without who's knowledge and skills are going to result in us being screwed, basically. Not to mention, making morale non existent and leaving us feeling like a bunch of miserable lost children wandering around a forest of uncertainty.    Fuck corporate America, that's all I have to say.

      The novelty of email has never worn off, even after all these years.  I think I've mentioned before that I'm an obsessive email checker, and the panic sets in when I haven't received an email after about five minutes during a normal workday.  Although, it's quite amazing how I can completely forget about email on the weekends.   However, the love of SMS is now taking over from the email thing. And again, I feel the novelty will never wear off.   Especially unprompted texts about stupid things. Gosh, I love them!  Sadly, though I'm becoming slightly obsessive about checking my phone and thinking that I can hear the message beep, when really it was just a bird chirping, or part of a song, or my mother speaking. Seriously.   And I can't express the disappointment when I realise that no, there is no text message and that really, I should just get on with my life.  Also, I'm wondering if anyone makes a mascara that doesn't make me look like Tammy Faye Baker.    It's kind of giving me the shits.  I feel that there is a conspiracy afoot among the cosmetic industry to encourage multiple purchases of mascara tubes.  They do this by making all their formulations change consistency at exactly the same moment, rendering all current mascaras in one's collection to become unusable unless you want to look as if you have spiders crawling over your eyes.  And I think you know how I feel about spiders.

      Gosh, did you like all that swearing in that last post?  It really wasn't just about the spiders, it's basically because I'm so easily influenced.  While at work during this alleged 'holiday' period (well, for some anyway), I was doing my usual obsessive blog reading and coming across a whole lot of new ones, where the writers were doing quite a lot of expressive swearing and making me laugh.  So, I thought I'd try on the 'swearing voice' and felt a diatribe about creepy creatures would be an appropriate forum for expletives.  It was fun, but really, I don't think I can sustain it. The swearing that is, not the diatribes.   Is it all over then? Is it done?  Is the eating, spending, gift-giving, celebrating, socialising, stressing, tiredness over?   Crikey, I hope so.     I really did have a lovely Christmas, and enjoyed the nice bits in between the madness, but I'm also glad, as usual, that all the palaver is kind of over and routine can be established again. (Clearly, displaying my tendency towards being Mrs Rainman with the whole 'need for routine' thing again).  Happy New Year, by the way, I was remiss to mention this last time because, clearly, I was too busy swearing.  May 2004 be tremendous and full of love, laughter, cups of tea, good coffee, time for friendships and kinships, peace and calm for all of us.

      I have a love/hate relationship with Oprah.  On the one hand I think she's a megalomaniac making millions of dollars by exploiting the fact that intelligent women hang on her every word and are continually being sucked into the vortex of the Oprah world of self-improvement, because maybe one day they can be like her and appear on the front cover of their own magazine every month.  On the other hand, I have been sucked into the vortex of the Oprah world of self-improvement.  I love the Oprah magazine, and the Oprah show. I cry every time I watch it.  I desperately want to reconnect with my spirit and make the world a better place, but more than anything, I want to be an audience member on the Christmas show and get all that cool stuff they give out.  Oprah is to 'new aged-ness' what Martha Stewart is to 'home-making'.  I love/loathe them both.  Both of them have managed to tap into what, I believe, modern women (okay, maybe just me then) , want. Spirtiualism without sacrificing Materialism.    I want to be a better person, but with nice furniture. It's the Oprah/Martha Way.  I want a fully accessorised soul, and a fully accessorised kitchen.  But not just any accessories, I want the autumnal shaded/New England/Turkey Hill/ kind of accessorising that appears in the glossy pages of the Oprah and Martha Stewart Living Magazines.  Also, I believe, both of them are possibly complete cows.  Having clawed their way to the top from unfortunate circumstances early in their lives and careers.   I feel that probably both of them have a completely 'fuck you' attitude to anyone who told them they couldn't make it.  And probably still do.  I don't think you get to be on the cover of every single edition of the magazine which bears your name by being nice to anyone.   I also don't think you get to have seventeen houses in the Hamptons and come up with the concept of an 'Omnimedia' by being polite.      I guess I can keep buying the magazines and watching the TV show, and crying when Oprah gives money to undeprivileged kiddies in the ghetto to go to college, but I guess I can still loathe her when she interrupts yet another movie star in the middle of an anecdote to tell them about herself.  I'll buy the spiritual thing for an hour or so, and I'll keep dreaming about my pristine white kitchen in my house in Martha's Vineyard, but I'll also keep my cynicism in an antique bell jar picked up in a flea market by the door too.

      When did the word 'party' become a verb?  What does it mean anyway? To 'party'?   Serves me right for listening to the dance music radio station, I guess.  I mean, I quite like the music and all, but do they have to decimate the English language in the process?  I don't know, whatever happened to respecting grammar and the proper meaning of words.  Sometimes, I find myself saying 'what was that again?'.  Fortunately, I'm not interested in going to the particular establishments advertised on the dance music radio station, because I would totally turn up at the wrong place at the wrong time, because I didn't hear the details properly.   Also, those events seem to be at really inconvenient times, like 2am, which frankly, is ridiculous.  I've always said, I'd love to go to a rave, if only they were held at reasonable times, say 7pm - 10pm.   I feel that I'm falling into the cracks between being young and old.  Especially in terms of having any alliance to a radio station.  I'm finding this dilemma a little bit stressful.  It used to be that one radio station would serve all my needs for music and information, but lately, I find I'm becoming a bit of a radio station slut, flicking between all of the radio stations programmed  into my car radio, all in the space of a 20 minute drive to work.  I think it depends on my mood, although I have found a number of times saying to myself ; 'Golly, what is this noise? I don't understand young people's music!'   And what's even sadder is that even if there is a song I particularly like on any given station, if it's anywhere near the hour, I will immediately feel the need to flick over to the station with the news on, in case I miss anything of great importance.  I'm turning into my Dad, who has to watch all the news bulletins on television every night.  Although disparaged by my mother at one point, who said 'You watch all that news and you still don't know anything'.   Oh well, until someone comes up with a fabulous radio station which plays a mixture of new stuff, old-ish stuff, sing-a-long stuff and a comprehensive current-affairs and news service without any commercials - but only at the times I feel like it, I'll be flicking the dial like a woman possessed.  Sometimes, being in your mid 30s sucks.

      Whoever came up with the saying 'a change is as good as a holiday' clearly has never been on a holiday.  Who comes up with this stuff? 'Easy as pie' is another one, have you ever made a pie? It takes frickin' ages and is not easy, especially making the pastry, it's difficult, it's tricky and time consuming. 'Easy as pie' - my arse.  'A walk in the park' - what's that about? A walk in the park can be quite arduous, especially if there's creatures around, like spiders and flies, and especially if it's hot.    Conceptually incorrect cliches are very annoying.  Although, really, I'm probably the only person I know who uses them. More fool me, eh?  I don't know if I've made a dumb decision.    I withdrew from a job application that I had probably a pretty good chance of getting. It was the travel thing, not the fact that it was a longer than normal journey to and from home (which was also a factor), but the notion of travelling round the state and possibly, country, made me think about the impact it would have on my life.    I just wasn't prepared to do it.  I think it would have been different if I had been younger and more gung-ho about these things, but I'm just not anymore.  I've come to the realisation that in my dotage my aim for calm and serenity has resulted in me searching for stability rather than chaos and whatever notion constitutes 'excitement'.    The things I find exciting are much smaller now, I think.  While I absolutely love the concept of travel, I'd rather do it on my own terms - for enjoyment,  and for me it's always been about the journey, if I had to work at the end of it, I'd just be focussing on that and not on what's happening on the way there.   I've never had any delusions about travelling for work, I've seen it around me with colleagues and it seems the gloss fades very quickly.  So that's it, really.  I made a decision and have to stick with it now.  God forbid, I should decide to make a stinkin' pie.

      Clearly, I've been having some existential crisis which has resulted in a  complete blogger's block.  You're lucky really, because all I would have blogged on about would have  been work (naturally), the vagaries of love and the current preoccupation  with spending money at $2 shops.  However, I have taken up with the knitting with a vengeance once again and  baby, I'm on a roll.  I've made two beanies, another scarf, and am currently in the process of  knitting a fantastic faux fur Cossack-style hat!  The first beanie was really a triumph, if I do say so myself - knitting on  circular needles - (which would make an excellent murder-weapon, perfect for  garrotting someone who really gets up your nose) - was tricky to start off with.   Was I knitting the same row again and again? Where did it start? Where did it end? It was a bit like knitting deja vu.  However, my mother, who is amazingly talented, worked out the whole circular knitting-needle procedure - even though she'd never used them before herself - what a woman!  Once I got going, I couldn't stop.   It was a circular knitting frenzy!   (I really need to get out of the house more, eh?)  Sadly, however, many people felt the need to disparage my very first knitted beanie solely on the basis of colour (it's a pale pink).  It even has kitten ears! The pattern was from this excellent  urlLink knitting book  (which even though I bought online, found two weeks later in my local bookshop -sheesh!).  My next project will definitely need to be items for two special babies to be born very shortly.    I feel, it's excellent when you can channel obsessive compulsiveness into useful things.

      I'm the worst kind of girl.   I think I'm low-maintenance, but really I'm high-maintenance.  I must be, how else can I explain the amount of stuff I need for day to day existence?  I know this because I'm house sitting again and had to haul four washing baskets full of stuff with me.  And I still forgot the hair dryer and sneakers. And my books.  It would be alright if I was Mrs Glamorous Fashion-plate who looked immaculate every second of the day, but I'm not, I'm just me. Albeit me, with clearly, a hair product fetish.    Oh, bugger, I think I forgot the hair spray too. Hair spray, eh?  Such a dead giveaway for the high maintenance thing, clearly.  But I don't want to be high-maintenance, Mum!   I want to be the kind of carefree, easygoing girl in the old fashioned tampon ads.  Flipping around in jeans and t-shirt with nary a care in the world and without a handbag.  Girls in ads never have handbags, do they? Don't think I haven't noticed.  That's just wrong.  Maybe I just need to face the fact that my carefree days are over.  Actually, did I ever have any carefree days to start off with?  I don't think so, come to think of it.  When have I ever been carefree? Never! Who's carefree anyway? Irresponsible people, that's who!  But I digress.  I guess I just have to come to terms that I'm the kind of person that needs a lot of stuff to do stuff.    I've always advocated better living through chemicals, but only from a cosmetic perspective, of course.  Seriously, anyone with  hair like mine would understand.  Two words 'naturally curly', so 'naturally curly' that if anyone were to see it in its 'natural state', well, let's just say that people would be chasing after me with torches and pitchforks to drive me out of the village.    I also think my need for stuff smacks a little of misdirected hope.  As in 'surely this anti-frizz serum/cafe au lait lipgloss/geranium scented body lotion/egg separator' will make my life fantastic, fulfilling and oh, maybe a little carefree perhaps?  Oh well, hope springs eternal doesn't it? and if not, then at least I'm keeping the people at the pharmacy in a job.

      Hmm, I feel a little bit bad about the whole Martha thing now, especially as she's been  urlLink convicted .    Oh, how the tall poppies get cut down.  But the question remains, was it about greed, Martha? Or should you have really gotten some better financial advisers, and/or lawyers. Maybe we'll never know.  All I do know, is that I have to make some cupcakes in commiseration.  Maybe I could put some tiny files in them.  The Oscars went by in a bit of a blur this year, it seemed that I preferred to go and do a step class at the gym than watch them. What was that all about?  I think it's about the blandness that has beset Hollywood.  It was all there, the bland and the beautiful.  Bland movies, bland movie stars, bland awards.  When one single movie completely blitzes the whole show, you know that the, how ever many, members of the 'Academy' were possibly so bored out of their minds with this year's selection of films on offer  (or completely hyped up on the free coke), that they probably scanned the list of films and just went 'Yeah, Lord of the Rings, the kids loved it' - tick.   urlLink Despondent   has been my word of the week, really.  It's been mainly free-floating despondency, however, I was cheered this week while watching a very interesting documentary about happiness, and informed that basically, humans are predisposed to being happy due to the limbic system and the frontal lobes.   The best thing though, is that you can train yourself to be happy whenever you want!  Although the catch seemed to be that you had to be a Buddhist monk and dedicate six hours a day to meditation, or something along those lines.  But it's good to know that you can do it, if you had the time.  I bet Martha's feeling slightly more despondent now, though.  She'll probably have quite a bit of time to meditate once she's in jail.  See? Every cloud has a silver lining.

      Too tired, can't think, can't write. So tired.  Actually, I'm not that tired. I've become prone to exaggeration lately, if only to make life more interesting. But I am slightly tired. You know, that stumbling around kind of deliriousness, the kind that makes you knock over whole displays of chocolate bars in convenience stores.  Clearly, it was yet another universal sign that I shouldn't not have even veered in the direction of the chocolate bars and just stuck with the bottle of water.  The shop owner was most kind and said not to worry about helping put all the chocolate bars back, but I persisted in helping him anyway while explaining the whole 'it's a sign' business.  His sense of relief when I walked away was palpable.     I think I'm turning into one of those old ladies who accost people at bus stops by beginning conversations in the middle of the story i.e  '...yes, he said that I should keep taking the aspirin for the blood clots' as if you're supposed to know the whole medical history.      Last week was hard rubbish collection week in my suburb. Here are some of the things I saw when I was out walking;  seven ovens (people must go through ovens like tissues in our suburb, this also included our oven, by the way.  There must be a shitload of extreme cooking blasting ovens all over the place in our area)  an enormous metal chest that looked exactly like a treasure chest in a pirate movie, I was almost tempted to open it and would not have been surprised to have been blinded by a great big pile of pieces of eight  a solitary computer monitor perched on the edge of the footpath in one street where there was no other hard rubbish, it looked as if it was waiting to cross the road. Surreal, man.  a huge pile of baby furniture, including a change table, a bath, a pram, a tricycle, a cot.  I'm kind of surprised they kept the actual baby.  a hibachi (so 80s')   Fascinating, really.

      I've had that new Britney Spears song running around in my head for the better part of the week now.  You know the one, the one where she's the hostie in the video clip -  Toxic .  I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic .  Oh, Britney, how correct you are. You are a bit of a cultural toxin.  I think it's the bit with the strings in that song that mainly is sticking in my brain, they're so, I don't know, wrong.   Oh, what am I saying, everything about Britney is wrong. Just wrong.  I've been watching quite a bit of the music videos lately, and golly, it's all a little bit eye opening.  There's an enormous amount of flesh on show at every opportunity, which is perfectly fine, but where does it all come from? Is there some amazing machine creating incredible-looking black girls with double-jointed pelvis' in some Hollywood backlot?  There must be, like, a gazillion of them hanging around waiting to be cast in the next Usher video.  The weird thing is there's never any two alike.  It's kind of scary.  It's like there's a whole race of uber-video girls roaming the planet in tiny outfits ready to take over the world.   Which I guess for the heterosexual male population of the world, I'm sure would be perfectly okay. But I feel a bit frightened that they'd force the rest of us to go to the gym every day and only eat protein.    Okay, so I'm knitting again.  Which is totally cool, however, the enormous amount of yarn (I used to call it 'wool' but apparently that's old school, baby) I have is testament to the ridiculous-ness of my obsession with the whole knitting extravaganza.  I've acquired so much of the stuff, that it's taking over a whole room in the house.  I know this, because while clearing off the stash of yarn from the spare bed to make room for my niece, the pile was so high, at one point,  I couldn't see her standing behind it.    But joy of joys, next weekend is the Sewing, Stitching and Handcrafts Show at the  urlLink Adelaide Showgrounds . I am SO there.  It's gonna ROCK! It'll be the Big Day Out of craft, I can just feel it in my waters.

      I've just had another perusal of the personals on the Yahoo website.  I don't know why.  Actually, yes, I do.  It's my birthday tomorrow, and I think that suddenly I should be doing something about being single and 36.  Somehow, though, after spending the past ten minutes (and believe me, ten minutes is the absolute maximum amount of time I'm prepared to put any effort into remedying this situation) I've come to the conclusion that had it not been for some comments aimed at me in the past couple of days by well-meaning family and friends (well, I'm assuming they were well-meaning, come to think of it, I don't think they were well-meaning at all, but rather blunt and not a little mean) I'm thinking 'Fuck that shit'.  Honestly, I can't be bothered.  Is that bad? Why is that bad?  It's not as if I've had any fantastic role models for blissful relationships around me.   How could I, when just today, I had my mother moan to me about my father's perceived 'annoying' behaviour (Ma, I love you, but it's been 45 years, he's NOT going to goddamn change NOW. It's not as this stuff is NEW!) and then in the same breath, without even blinking, say 'You really need to find someone and get married''?What the?  The whole thing makes me cranky.  Huh, 'what's new', you might say?  I don't understand why it bothers people so much, this single-dom. I wonder if they think it's catching, like some creepy disease which will render everyone alone, a little bit crazy, and wanting many, many cats as pets.  It's not as if I don't know the consequences of being by myself forever.  I'll just get myself one of the groovy alarm things to hang around my neck, you know, those big alert necklaces that look like the clocks that Flavor Flav from Public Enemy wears.  I'll be hip when I break my hip! (ha!)  I know, ultimately, the people in my life want me to be 'happy', but clearly, they can't see the forest for the trees.    Oh, feel free to dismiss these ravings as cynical bitterness, but you know what? Tomorrow, I'm 36. I couldn't give a shit what you think.  :)

      I guess I should work backwards from today when I fell over during step class.  The Universe doesn't really let you get away with anything, I feel. The falling over was clearly payback for thinking ill of the completely uncoordinated girl I was looking at during the beginning of the class and thinking to myself, maybe she's a bit mental.  Not less than two minutes later I'm on the floor having stumbled over my own step and recalcitrant feet.  Thankyou Universe, lesson learned, people in glass houses etc etc.  Generally the week has been a test for me, as it's been a bit of  a routine disruption one, mainly because of the whole house-sitting business.  Oh, generally it's been fine, but I'm beginning to wonder what the neighbours think of my constant to-ing and fro-ing from the premises. Not that I'll ever find out, because I've never seen any sign of them in the whole two weeks I've been there.  Not one sign. At all. No-one. It's like the Marie Celeste in that cul de sac, I tell you.   I have however, been privy to the  sounds  of the neighbours, in particular the sounds of the creepy Eraserhead-type mewlings of the baby who's room is approximately two feet from the bedroom I'm currently sleeping in.  Well, I guess that's a bit harsh, I'm sure the baby is completely delightful, however it seems to cry at incredibly irregular intervals, and although it's never constant or goes on for long periods of time, it's a little unsettling.  The thing is, living in a newish, high density development-land, I find myself jolting awake at the sound of the crying baby because it seems to emanate from inside the room, and I immediately think  'oh, the baby is crying again, must get up to feed it'!  It takes a few seconds to register that  a) I'm in someone else's house b) it's 3:32am c) the baby is not mine.    While I must admit I'm pretty okay on the whole domestic front generally, my forte is clearly inside the home.   Having lived my whole life with wonderful parents who've pretty much got the 'looking after the house' thing covered, especially my father who, had he had the means and resources would pretty much have blitzed freakin' Don Burke in terms of gardening prowess, I tend to forget about the outside of homes, ie. how, when and why to water the lawns, unlock unfamiliar gates, sweep away hideous creatures, mainly because I've never really had to do it.  Which prompted the phone call to my sister today to ask 'how long does one leave a sprinkler running on a smallish patch of lawn'.   Her answer? 'Until it looks like it doesn't need watering anymore'.  This is from the same woman who said, prior to her wedding, 'Yes, I'm happy to do everything inside the house and he can do everything outside the house - that's why I'm going to put the washing machine, vacuum cleaner and kitchen out in the backyard'. My sister is a classic.  Also, I had to replace the smoke alarm battery, I realised this only because someone said to me, 'You need to replace the smoke alarm battery because it's beeping'.  I said 'Beeping? Oh, I thought it was a bird outside'.  Thankyou Universe, once again, for ensuring I learn these things, because, clearly, my destiny as a spinster will mean such incidences will crop up again and therefore I'll know exactly what to do next time.

      The Canberra Chocolate Festival has continued this week, even though I'm no longer in Canberra.  A weekend spent in the nation's capital was delightful, catching up with friends was fantastic, eating three blocks of Lindt chocolate and one block of Green and Blacks organic chocolate was not.  Well, it was fantastic in the delicious sense, but not so fantastic in the glutton sense.  I think I might have to come up with the supermarket tour of the world, I can't tell you how much I love wandering about supermarkets in foreign lands, to me they epitomise the local culture.  Where else would you find what makes a community tick but by what they buy to eat?  Canberra residents clearly like good quality chocolate, well the particular area I was staying in anyway.  The Lindt section was extensive, so of course,  I bought a selection of the Lindt under the guise of giving them as gifts to those back home.  Sorry kids, no gifts, I ate the gifts.  They were delicious.

      In between the Google stalking, the working, the tiredness and the computer viruses, it's been a little bit hectic. But not so much that I haven't been able to finish another scarf.    I wonder if the things I knit become imbued with the programs I watch while knitting them. For instance this last scarf would have quite a bit of  'Law & Order' in it, so hopefully the wearer will not feel the need to go out and commit a crime, but perhaps feel more of a need to fight for justice. I hope so.  I'm hoping that the ones knitted during Sex and the City result in people getting laid (or at the very least being able to afford a pair of Manolos).  Oh, the Google stalking thing? I came across this term while reading another blog a while ago, and thought 'heh, what sort an idiot would do such a thing'.    Clearly, me.  Here's the  urlLink beginner's guide  to Google Stalking   I love that there's a guide.  Who was I stalking may you ask? Sure, go ahead.  It was a bit of response to a group email sent out, one name looked unfamiliar, could this be the long lost school friend Mr Some Sort of Potential Paramour had been talking about?? Yes! It was!   No more than two links later, there she was. Excellent! I was actually more proud of my internet search abilities than anything else.  Of course, the social ramifications of what I had done failed to register just then. They did later.  Yes, I am psycho freak stalking poor defenceless people on the internet due to insecurities and clearly not having anything better do to.  How did I become this person? Why did I become this person?  I blame the media.  And Google's comprehensive search capabilities and ease of use.

      Here's a tip for you knitters out there.  When planning a knitting project make sure you buy all the required yarn before you FUCKING START!!!  This will save you much anguish and petrol money driving all over the countryside attempting to find discontinued balls of yarn to finish your stupid jumper.  And just so you know, this is mainly a tip for me.  This is has been my life for the past couple of days, beginning from the initial 'shit, shit, shit' realisation that eight balls of anything was never going to cut it for a lardy ladies' jacket, to the 'I'm sorry, we don't stock THAT particular yarn', said in a very noticeable condescending tone' to my creepy gratitude expressed to the lovely manchester assistant Sharon at Big W, who knew EXACTLY what my crisis was (clearly, there's A LOT of disorganised knitters out there).  She was able to scrounge the required balls of yarn from the very back shelf.  She even had to get a step ladder! What a nice person, if I had not been on the phone, I would have hugged her.  Of course, did this stop me from purchasing yet even more yarn at a reasonable cost, with no particular project in mind? Because yes, three balls of something fluffy and nice will make a scarf, but do I really freakin' need another scarf? No, I don't.  I need to get my knitting shit together and start planning shit.  I'm not even going to begin to attempt to translate that to other areas of my life just yet.  One major thing at time, thanks.

      Is it weird to be frightened by a hot water bottle?  I guess the circumstances warranted, coming home late after work one night and finding a strange lump under the covers of one's bed and momentarily waiting for it to perhaps move. What the hell is that?   It turned out to be the hot water bottle my mother lovingly placed in my bed for me. So an act of love, temporarily turned into an act of terror for only for a very short time.  I don't know, I seem to regularly be confronted with small terrors on returning home from work late on Saturday nights, usually of the creature variety, ie. spiders, moths, mice.   The late night is a lonely time and having to fight off things with brooms and cans of insect spray (sometimes hairspray, perfume whatever is at hand) can be a little bit daunting, especially when you're trying to not wake the rest of the household.  Woe is me, eh?  Clearly, I don't have anything of merit to complain about.  Apart from the fact that I think I've been scorned.  The dictionary definition of scorn is; Contempt or disdain felt toward a person or object considered despicable or unworthy.  The expression of such an attitude in behavior or speech; derision.  One spoken of or treated with contempt  I don't know if what's happened to me can constitute contempt and disdain, which I feels requires some sort of passion on the part of the scorner (me, being the scornee), and there's really been none of that, much more of a shrugging 'don't really care' attitude.  Anyhoo, I've always loved that saying 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned', and basically that's true. Although being  passive aggressive, my 'hell' has pretty much been internal and lots of fantasising about potential vengeful acts and witty sayings. But of course, none of this has eventuated in real life, and I've spent quite a bit of time moping instead.  I guess it's winter,  and it's okay to mope in winter, I have all the accessories of moping, the aforementioned hot water bottle, pyjamas, big fluffy bed socks, a really droopy cardigan.  It's actually quite easy to mope with such attire.  I figured I could take up smoking, I think that smoking is a good moping activity.  While ultimately not good for one's health (I don't know the health merits of moping, I think as it doesn't require much physical exertion, it could be classed a sort of meditation), people who smoke always seem to have that pensive quality when dragging on a ciggie - although in reality it's probably the high from the nicotine rush.  It is difficult to mope at work though. Which is a bit frustrating, as dealing with people tends to negate any moping activity. For which I'm feeling slightly resentful and grateful at the same time.  At which, on cue, here comes someone now who needs some help and clearly, my allocated moping time for today is done.

      I'm so resisting the urge to delve into the land of self pity with this particular entry, consequently, instead I will focus on the slow descent into spinsterhood dementia I'm currently experiencing.  No, that's not the same.  It's like, totally funnier.  It started with the wearing of two different shoes.   Yes, for a whole day I was wearing two different shoes.  I don't quite know how this happened, well, yes I do.  An early, dark, wintry morning, usual morning rush, lack of  wardrobe organisational skills, three pairs of shoes almost identical in shape and colour.  Gradual onset of dementia.  You do the maths.  What I find most incredible was that this particular day included a visit to the chiropractor, a longish conversation with the guy fixing my car, walking home to pick up alternative car, normal workday dealings with people, not actually noticing differing of shoes until approximately 3pm.  Which says a lot of things really, from 'how excellent that no-one noticed', to 'hang on, why didn't' anyone notice?, to 'Girlfriend, I really need to get some new shoes'.  Although I am glad that I entertained a number of colleagues, including Upstairs Dave who, after being told via Instant Messaging about the differing shoes, instantly descended the stairs to appear by my desk in approximately two seconds to verify the fact.  On the one hand, I'm happy that I'm surrounded by people who don't actually care about matching shoes, but on the other hand makes me feel a little sad about the variety in my wardrobe.  And it's nice to know that people are positive about these things, as another coworker pointed out, 'Well, you don't work with any gay men and they definitely would have noticed'.  Also, I forgot about three people's birthdays. For which I have no excuse, really. It's not as if they're not written down in my diary in big silver letters, or that these people have these birthdays on the same day every year. Well, I do have an excuse, mainly the self-pity thing alluded to earlier.  But I've realised that, ultimately, I'm too busy for self-pity and in fact, apart from ruining my day, really fucks up my timetable.

      I'm feeling slightly overwhelmed by technology at the moment.  In the past week I have acquired a new computer, a new mobile phone and an MP3 player. None of which I have even removed from the box yet. They have been sitting in the spare room untouched for the past week.  This begs the question, did I really need any of those items in the first place, despite the total purchase sum of these objects being relatively substantial?  Why the fuck then, did I buy them? I don't know, peer pressure, I guess.   Additionally, the situation begs the question - what have I been doing with my time, that I haven't even attempted to sit down and tinker with each of these new acquisitions?  Well, let's see, this week included a substantial television mini-series commitment, the baking of cupcakes for morning tea for a departing colleague, attempting to do more knitting and, oh I don't know,  I guess talking with people in person!  Gosh, completely low tech pursuits, while the potential for a high tech lifestyle sits untouched gathering dust.  How can this be in 2004?  While I felt slightly anxious at the whole inability to schedule time to plug everything in, I finally came to  the conclusion  that feasibly, the quality of my lo-tech life is possibly far superior to anything which can be provided by an electronic piece of equipment (oh, get your mind out of the gutter).  Although be warned, clearly, this time next week I'll be extolling the virtues of my groovy new mobile phone which apparently has lights which flash in time to loud music.   How cool is that?

      Just so you know, cat shit stinks. If you can avoid it don't please don't step in it. However, if you do, please make sure you're made aware of the fact before you A) get in your car to drive to work rather than be bemused by the hideous smell for a whole 20 minute drive , B) spend a whole morning  dealing with people while the aroma of cat shit permeates your particular section of the office C)  realise that yes, that hideous smell is coming from you.  All I can say is bless lovely Mrs Cleaner who opened her heart and her storerooom to me to use all manner of industrial strength cleaning products to help me out of a particularly nasty catshit jam.  You know, even the thought of that smell is making me gag. I won't bring it up again.  I was Ms Hardass consumer today, my computer broke (after 8 years, it's had a good innings, I'll miss it), so  I need a replacement, I waltzed into the computer shop, stated my budget, what I needed, when could I have it? Mr Computer Shop person was slightly bemused and said 'okay' to all of my demands for a new computing system.   If only I could be as assertive in other areas of my life.     Oh dear, one of my 'alternative colleagues' ie. from job no 2 thinks my name is something other than my real name.   While this isn't a global problem on a universal scale, seeing as I deal with him for no more than two minutes each week to hand him a piece of paper, I can't help thinking that I should have nipped this misunderstanding in the bud earlier on in the piece.  What happens, if, during the two minutes I need to deal with him,  I collapse in a heap or other untoward event and he has to ring an ambulance and he'll say it's for 'Lisa', 'Lisa's collapsed', and then, while they're treating me, they're calling "Lisa, Lisa can you hear us?" and I don't respond and they think I'm dead? Or I wake up say my name is not Lisa it's Gossy and they think that I've got amnesia and give me inappropriate drugs?     It's a minefield, I tell you.  Should I tell him? It's been nearly four years.   I don't know about this Miss Universe thing.  I mean good luck to Miss Australia and all, but really, in 2004 is it still relevant? Oh hang on, chicks in bikinis strutting around a stage while people judge them purely on physical proportions and ability to walk in killer heels without looking down? What am I thinking? Relevant? Damn straight.

      How's  urlLink this  for a nifty idea.  Of course, not available for Australians, but a girl can dream.  Although thinking about it, in theory a fantastic concept, if all the girls borrowing the bags are anything like me, I don't think I'd be too thrilled receiving my borrowed Prada with bits of tissue, a sticky Kool Mint and about $7.25 in loose change stuck in the bottom.  I don't know about you, but my bed-time ritual is getting out of hand.  Honestly, these days I'm having to plan what time I actually want to go to sleep, because the bed-time ritual has suddenly become a bit like a steeplechase.  Without wanting to bore you with the details, there's just seems to be an inordinant amount of cleansing, flossing, eye-makeup removal, hot water bottle filling, teeth brushing etc etc (well, that's pretty much it), and it seems to take fucking ages.  I swear, I'm lucky that I'm asleep by midnight, having decided to go to bed at about 9pm.  Why can't I just be like Courtney Love and fall flat on my face onto the bed in my slutty clothes and smeared mascara?  I'd save a heck of a lot of time.  Today I played Cluedo for the first time in my life.   I don't know what you think about it,  but that game is seriously whacked.   At one point my sister said 'do you think it's appropriate we're playing this game with a six year old?' when we had to explain to my niece what each of the weapons were and what the actual concept of the game was?  Fortunately, she was not conceptualising the premise of the game in terms of the notion of murder and suspects and weapons, as one at one point, after throwing the dice her 'Suggestion' (as opposed to 'Accusation'- I also didn't realise it was a game of fucking semantics) was 'Professor Plum in the kitchen eating vegetables with a knife'.  We then played Uno where I learned a few home truths about members of my family in regards to their incredible lack of sportsmanship and shameless ability to cheat.

      Okay, while I don't usually see the world in black and white -&nbsp;that would completely set me up for some ridiculous psyche overload and push me right over the edge -&nbsp; today, I've decided to delineate between good and bad, for no reason other than I'm procrastinating and am only waiting until&nbsp;afternoon tea time&nbsp;to try a new hot drink (some weird, low-fat white chocolate concotion, bound to be vile and full of xenoestrogens and fake chemical froth, but hey, whatever floats my boat, Right?).   Here's the bad (and remember, this is only bad from my perspective at this point, so I'm not talking global 'bad', this is just 'bad right now, for me')   - I've stayed at the same weight for the past 11 weeks (okay, for me this is bad, as I'm attempting to persevere with losing weight, and this is beginning to become less of a plateau and more of&nbsp;a giant fucking Mongolian steppe and frankly, it's giving me the shits. Don't even get me started with the whole weight loss 'tips and tricks' for getting off a plateau because if I read one more time that I have to 'vary my exercise routine' or 'persist with patience', &nbsp;I swear I'll get out an&nbsp;Ouzi and open fire)   - All the nice people at work are leaving, which makes me very sad because soon, the only people who are going to be left are a bunch of freakish self-serving managers and clearly, unemployable, me&nbsp; and that frightens me quite a lot   - While we're on the subject, well,&nbsp; work - work is bad, I'm sick of it.&nbsp; I'm over it. I want to win a billion dollars in Lotto and go work in a shop for 2 hours a day selling things to people they actually want and like   - My sleep pattern is shot to shit and I keep waking up every half hour after consistently strange dreams involving trips to Spotlight wearing unusual sneakers   Right, that's enough of that, here's the good;   - Chocolate Le Rice  - my new MP3 player  - I have a job, don't I?  - I am healthy, aren't I?  - I'm not defined by my work, am I?   So quit complaining, right?   Right.  I'm going to have my fake white hot chocolate now.  Right.

      I really don't have a lot to say.   Oh, except to say that the sleeves of the jumper I'm knitting are so wrong. But you know what? I refuse to unravel shit this time and they can just be kooky for all I care.&nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly, as if there aren't enough rules and regulations in life, I'm not going to be dictated to by some dogmatic manifesto of a knitting pattern dammit!   Also I think I've realised that I can't drink coffee after 6pm. &nbsp;This has officially put me in the category of 'old person' I think.&nbsp;&nbsp; Long gone are those wild days of sucking up the espresso at 11pm and still being able to sleep like a log immediately after.   Uh uh, not anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like last night, having a lovely latte after dinner at about 8:45pm, and then lying in bed approximately two hours later with my eyes wide open a la 'A Clockwork Orange' with a procession of ridiculous thoughts running through my mind such as " I wonder if there'll be any Craisins at the supermarket tomorrow because I want to make muffins' or 'I don't know if I can buy a new bike because some assembly is required' and "will I like any of the summer fashions this year?".   Clearly, this is not going to stop me drinking coffee, &nbsp;all I need to do is ensure I have my quota before 6pm. I wonder if I'll get any work done?   Sadly, though I have to admit (and this is not good as the daughter of Italian migrants who mainline espresso every five minutes of the day)&nbsp; I've been drinking a lot of those 'fake' coffees in sachets.&nbsp; I try really hard not to think about the froth in those things.&nbsp; &nbsp;As in, what exactly makes it go frothy when 'real' froth on a coffee is just aerated milk.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't even want to begin to imagine the composition of the 'froth-making' chemicals.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do wonder about the person who's job it was to chemically approximate real coffee froth. How do work that out? Do you do a 'CSI' and put random samples of froth into zip lock bags and race back to the lab? Or would you have to go and do a barista course first? Who knows? I wonder where I can find out?   And while I'm on the subject,&nbsp;&nbsp; I've also been having a lot of Cup-A-Soups, you know the ones, packets of something pretending to be 'Hearty Beef and Vegetable' or 'Seafood Bisque'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, not really wanting to know the exact composition of that shit.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, who are they kidding?&nbsp;&nbsp; Sodium and dehydrated onion bits do not a 'hearty' soup make, do they?&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, they are oddly delicious.&nbsp;&nbsp; And really, it's all so 21st century isn't it? Hey presto, instant food! In one cup! Fantastic and oh so modern!   I told you I had nothing to say.

      This morning I put blusher, instead of concealer, under my eyes.  I don't know if this is related to the 'different shoe wearing' incident the other week, but I'd class that as a 'yes'.  I did have porridge though, for breakfast, and that kind of made everything okay again.  My weekend was slightly weird.  Starting off okay, with a weird bit in the middle and then ending up okay again with a bit of an ice skating fairy tale bonanza.  It was, I guess, a kind of 'bookended weirdness weekend'.  I guess it mainly had to do with taking my Dad to the hospital.   Oh, he's okay, thankfully. But gosh, when you calmly walk into the house and announce that the doctor suggested it might be a 'good idea' to go to the hospital after suffering from chest pains for TWO fucking days. Well, yeah. You can't expect us not to go a little wiggy.  Poor J-Girl, who was eating cheese at the time at my house and had to be ushered out hastily all because of my father's denial of his health. Sorry J-Girl!   I feel I would like to take this opportunity to lament about the state of both the public and private health sector. The first question one is now asked when seeking medical assistance is not 'How are you?' but 'How are you going pay,  girlfriend ??". And I mean  girlfriend  because clearly, there's a bit of an attitude going on with the whole paying thing in hospitals nowadays.    Honestly, the payment information/waiver which was shoved in my face the second we stepped inside the sliding doors  could have said '..EFTPOS, Credit or Cash ..oh, and you will sell your soul to the Devil'.  I didn't give a shit at the time and just wanted someone to make sure my father was going to be okay.  How bizarre! I hope I haven't sold my soul to the Devil? Although, he'll soon realise he'll want his money back, so I'm not too worried.  Anyway, clearly when there are heart issues with people they don't mess around in the emergency medical care area (the cynical part of me believing this to be that if someone does cark it in the waiting room, who's going to pay the fucking bill?).  We were pretty much ushered in almost straight away.  The upshot being that my father's heart is okay and his lungs are fine too. Apparently. Despite being a smoker for 60 years. Can you believe that? My Dad is some freaky dude.  I guess that goes a long way to explaining, well, me.  After the initial relief that it wasn't a heart attack and while we were waiting for other tests just to make sure I entertained myself by eavesdropping on the other patients and their associated dilemmas in the next bay in the emergency room.  The first woman had been thrown off her horse and broken her arm. She seemed to be in a lot of pain (er, DER) The moaning was a bit disconcerting, but then almost immediately she seemed perky and fine.  Morphine rocks, clearly.  I did secretly giggle at the nasty jokes about the fate of the horse made by her father and husband. For example 'well, I know what the dogs will be eating for the next couple of months heheheh'  one of them said at one point. (I am not making this up, by the way).  The second woman came in and starting describing her symptoms.  Hmm, I thought.  Clearly, she has had a panic attack.  The doctor examined her and proclaimed  "You've had a panic attack".   YESSS! I whispered. How good am I? I said to dad, "I should be a doctor". He gave me the 'dad look' that said 'you should be an idiot'.    That's when I knew he would be okay.

      How to creep ME out - part I  Repair my labelmaker and, when I switch it on after having it returned to me from repair, witness the display as reading  'Touch Me and You'll Die'   Um, I don't know if I'll be using those people again to repair anything ever again.

      How to creep out service people - Part I  1) tell the girl at the checkout that it's amazing how time must fly because you remember her when she had really short spiky black hair as opposed to the long brown ponytail she has now.    2) when the guy who organised your car radio install writes his name on your appointment card and you pick it up, read it, pause and then say 'Thank-YOU, Dave!' in an overtly chipper fashion.  3) at five minutes before closing begin to tell the girl behind the layby counter while she is counting change about how grateful you were that the girl in manchester was able to find the balls of wool you needed to finish your knitting, because goodness knows, you weren't very good with planning and how you'd spent the whole week running around trying to find the right wool, but could only find five balls, when clearly you needed 11 and you were wondering if you were ever going to finish it, and maybe how you might have to unravel it all and what a waste that would be because, jeepers, you'd spent ages trying to follow a proper pattern for the first time...etc  4) Ask the boy at the checkout of the convenience store whether they have any copies of The Adelaide Review and he points to the enormous pile of them on the counter right in front of your face

      Yes, I've changed the template.  No, I don't know why.  I think I was obsessing over fonts and thinking that if I had a different font my posts would perhaps be more concise, clever, a little wittier and certainly more relevant. Shyeah, right.  Anyway, thankyou to lovely  urlLink Cousin Peter  for his original blog template and inspiration (this is fast turning into an Oscar speech, quit it).  Good old Blogger really, for making it so easy to look clever (HTML-wise, that is).  Anyway, the bottom line is that only the template has changed, the content clearly hasn't and I guess you can expect the usual drivel.  I'm so apolitical, it's not funny. With an election looming and all sorts of talk of Free Trade Agreements and the like this week, I guess I should be taking more notice, but I don't. Is that bad? Is it un-Australian not to care about politics, no I shouldn't lump a whole nation in with my own apathy. That's not fair. It's just that the blandness (read 'right winged') state of politics at the moment, just doesn't cut it for me, I'm afraid.  Initially, I was a tiny bit interested when Mark Latham came onto the scene with the potential for a bit of bluster and ruddy-faced Labor gung-ho, but that's kind of disappeared hasn't it? It seems he's had his initial political fiestiness kicked out of him in the 'be nice, don't make a ruckus' mode of campaigning favoured these days. Yes, just a bit like the American style of campaigning perhaps? So I guess the Free Trade Agreement doesn't exclude our own election.  Anyhoo, I bought an inordinate amount of cheese today. No, seriously I did. I bought two lots of fetta, a 'new' kind of 'smooth' cottage cheese, some cheese slices and a tub of cream cheese. I wonder if I've got some weird calcium deficiency thing going on and it's subconsciously made me stock up on the cheese.  Perhaps it's all the pseudo-ephedrine I've been taking in the form of cold and flu tablets (because I have a cold and not for fun, I might add). Here's a tip though, dont' take cold and flu tablets on an empty stomach, just so you don't freak out your family by going pale and nearly passing out over coffee and biscuits and frightening the small children.

      Is it weird for a piece of clothing to make one quite happy? I don't know whether clothing is a legitimate source for joy, but by golly, my new skirt is pretty much up there today.  I think primarily because it's a bit swirly and a bit 50s, it's just a tweedy A-line number, but it's swirly! And it was a bargain to boot. All I feel like doing today is skipping along and whizzing around so that my skirt twirls.  Although legitimately that would mean not much productivity and possibly alot of feaking out of coworkers. Although they freak me out regularly, so it would be worh the payback.  Excuse me , while I walk over to another desk and then turn suddenly, ooh look! my skirt twirled!
