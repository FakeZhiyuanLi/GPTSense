      I like the term "heartwrench". It seems like a heartwrench would be a good thing, something to loosen the lugs on the old ticker.  Tonight, I have abandoned the hope that Brian will ever marry me. I have abandoned the hope that there will ever be anything more than this. I have abandoned this hope before, and now I know what it means for hope to spring eternal. It's like fleas, or building your house on a flood plain.  Of course, at first, I had some anguish. We were sitting on the couch, and I asked him, "What have you got against marriage?" and he said, "Nothing. I have nothing against marriage." And I said, "But you don't want to marry me." and he said, "Not right now." and I said, "These things take time to plan." and he (annoyed) said, "I know." and then he said, "Look, I've spent 10-12 years thinking that I didn't want to get married, ever. That kind of thinking doesn't change overnight."  I looked at the TV. Peggy Hill wiped away a latte moustache. I said, "Well, I understand how you could feel that way, though in my mind, this hasn't been an overnight thing." And then we just sat on the couch for another 20 minutes.  So, here's the deal. He and I, we're having different relationships here. We don't have a single, shared experience, but two experiences that sort of twist together, but are really, very different. And, I can't ever know what his experience is, really. I mean, I get the gist of it, like someone telling you about a movie. But, I don't get the reality of it. And no amount of explaining is going to bring his experience into sharp focus for me.  The other night, Sunday night, we had sex, after a long dry spell. We've been so busy getting the house ready to sell, and so tired, just sort of falling in bed and falling asleep. So, he knew that I missed it. He knew that I really missed all of it. And so, he held me really tight,and he kissed me, and he put his tongue in my mouth, and his tongue is huge. He has a really big tongue, and it pretty much filled my mouth, and I was thinking to myself, "Is this what he thinks I want?," and also, "Oh, this is pretty hot." I mean, I couldn't turn my head away. I had no choice but to open my mouth. But I didn't know what he was experiencing. As a typical guy, it was probably no more than a bodily choice, a "gee, I feel like sticking my tongue in her mouth." But considering our mismatched libidos, and considering how often I wonder if he just doesn't like my body, or maybe he just doesn't like to feel that close to a person. He's rather introverted. So, considering all that, his tongue in my mouth took on new meaning, it took on any number of meanings, as I tried each one out for authenticity. Is this for my benefit? Is he joking? Why doesn't he take the time to really figure out what I want?  So, after this marriage conversation, I went back into the kitchen to finish stripping paint off the spice cupboard. And I realized that we were, again, having different relationships. He may see me as his companion, but he doesn't see me as his wife, or even, future wife. We may be buying a farm together, and building a house, and we may share several bank accounts, and fuck most Monday nights, but at the end of the day, he goes in his hearthouse and I go in mine.  My gut reaction, then, is to come back to independence. To abandon hope of marriage, and my own domestication, and go back to the wild, and kill my own supper and cook it myself. It feels good, in some ways, to come back to an independent state. But I will miss that feeling of safety, even if it isn't real.
