      It takes a minute to have a crush on someone, an hour to like someone and a day to love someone. but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. a sad thing about life is when you meet someone that means a lot to you but only to find in the end, that it was never bound to be and you just have to let go. Its true that we dun know what we have got until we lose it, but its also true that we dont know what we have been missing until it arrives. giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they wil love you back, dont expect love in return, just wait for it to grow in their hearts. but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours....

      juz recieved my other test paper...it sux big time....dun really wanna tok bout it....  I can feel friends fading away. I've been dreading this day where life after school no longer has any reasons  for me to keep in contact with school acquintances. with my circle of friends reducing. I don't want to look at my contact list and find only a handful of hangout-able friends.  I don't want to be lonely... I wanna find a GAL hu can go out with me everyday...so bored  I guess I'm the type of guy who falls into the "geeky dude who plays computer games, watch anime,  and hang out with guy buddies only" group. ps:i am not a gay  A horny girl/crazy guy messaged me on irc, asking me to add her/him on irc and MSN. she keep bringing up the topic of sex and dirty stuff If she/he's a she, then Wow, I've found a rare wild girl in Singapore. If she/he's a he, IS HE GAY? Anyway i did not add him/her  Hell yeah man my friend nicholas juz came to my house and fixed up my drums and o my god, its like magic... he tuned it like fark man it sound so freaking good....o mi god will i turn into a gay(kidding)
