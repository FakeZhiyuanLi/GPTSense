      in my "hot or not" post  below, i listed "the princess bride" in my hot column.......tom g responded to this with the following comment:  "i thought i was the only one who thought that girl from the princess bride was hot."    well tom g, i gotta break it to u, u r the only one who thinks that girl from the princess bride is hot... my inclusion of princess bride in the hot list referred to the movie as a whole, its a great movie, from inigo montoya to the posioned challace scene... the girl , however, is butt ugly... tom g's dirty little secret has been EXPOSED!!!...apparently amir is not the only guy who likes pale white girls....what would rani think tom g

      some comments and confessions:  i heard nihar was given the penske file.....but i doubt he's penske material  "lost in emotion" by lisa lisa and the cult jam might be the greatest song of all time  even though shes not muslim or a virgin, and has a korean baby, id marry angelina jolie right now....or just have sex with her  the only thing possibly funnier than amir dancing is seein nihar at prom........aaah, who am i kidding, theres nothing funnier than seeing amir dance  one of these days, im gonna order a large pepperoni pizza....and id like to see u stop me  im just not attracted to black girls....just cant do it...i think its the hair  i cant find blondes attractive either....they look too much like bologne.....  its so hard to talk to white girls now, they seem so damn ignorant of the world.....  i hate chinese girls too.....their breath always smells like shrimp  things in real life dont happen like they do in the movies...i once put ex-lax in someones food...they didnt jump up and run to the bathroom....it takes 4-6 hours for the stuff to kick in  i dont know what the hell a guju is....but it sounds like something u buy at the snack counter at the movies....and it probably taste like doo-doo  lynda carter at 50 is still hot as hell....so is mary ann from giligans island  no matter how hot an indian girl is, hearin that fuckin accent makes my balls retract.....think about that before u marry rani tom g.....about the accent, not my balls retracting  how did monica from friends all of a sudden become a lot hotter than rachel...  why did i used to think sandra bullock was so hot???  "informer" is a very catchy song....

      here r asaads comments: man, i should be one of the cool bengalis; i bring so much of the humor at our get togethers...i thought u were fan...seems like ur just a deceptive faker...and btw, cricket is better than that one afghan sport with the goat-head ball.  someone responded to his comment: asaad, jesus christ, why are you guys obsessed with your colonizer's sport. don't you have any ethnic bengali games? --naaz  my answer: sure they do, it involves ordering the cheapest thing on the menu then mooching food off ur friends to save a buck....cheap bastards

      chinese:  i saw some light beer commercial that depicted 4 ppl doing "power blinking" in order to burn the low amount of carbs in that beer...one of the 4 ppl was a chinese woman....i wondered to myself, does she have to do more reps than the others since shes only doin half the work???  iranians:  why do they all sell used cars?? u can be talking to an iranian medical doctor with 3 phD's and a seat in the iranian government, and the second u mention ur lookin to buy a car, the buttons on their shirt pops off, thick, black chest hair sprouts out, gold necklaces appear,their hair slicks back, and they notify u that they sell used cars in the spare time.    indians:  they just stink...and got crusty lips....and ashy elbows....and some of them have purple lips and gums like my dogs...most r harmless though, theyd rather watch gay bollywood movies than fight for their country....yeaaaa, let the british come shit on u even though u outnumber them 132352343 to 1, theyll still let u watch ur bollywood.....and whats up with indian ppl who say theyre british when u ask them where theyre from...no bitch, ur indian, ur a fuckin patel, ur not british..... (excluding nihar and his family)  pakis: see above....pakis have the same base smell as the indians, except they incorporate a hint of body odor as opposed to the nuance of curry that the indians mix with that same base odor...pakis r also cheap bastards.....they bitch and moan that ppl should be more islamic and that the muslims should help eachother out, yet, when bush waggles a couple dollars in their face, they bend over and spread wide....they remind me of those little flying monkeys from the wizard of oz....short, dark, monkeys....  bengalis: i like tom g  jewish ppl: oh  man, where do i start....all ill say is that iv never seen a group of ppl who run the fuckin world always try to act like the victims in every fuckin situation  arabs: the cause of all the problems in the middle east....theyd fuck a chicken if it had blonde hair.....

      ok bitches, time for the dream to finally put it down.  i know what u homos r thinking, creating a blog is very un-samim like.  yea, i know, but i was struck by inspiration.  what was the source of this inspiration? the answer may surprise u.  as i did my routine check of away messages on my buddy list, i ran across our old friend asaad....in his profile, he had a link that was titled, "my inner soul."  now, for those of u who know asaad, i do not have to explain the uncontrollable curiousity and temptation to click that link... for those of u who do not know this bengali wonder, this is the guy who went to a restaurant and asked for water with no ice, explaining that without the ice, u get more water....now u can imagine the thoughts that ran thru my mind when i wondered what could possibly represent asaads inner soul...a few things crossed my mind: big black womens' asses, asaad crying when his father broke all his 3-6 mafia cd's, gremlins, a stuffed adnan doll he goes to bed with....the possibilities were endless...so i click it, and its a link to his blog where he posts results of bengali cricket matches, because, of course, we all wait in anticipation to find out how many wickets some bengali jackass knocked over...so i figure i needed my own area to say whats on my mind... over the yrs, i have made u laugh, made u cry, made fun of u, started fights, and stirred up much contraversy with my away messages, but away messages r just short, fleeting samples of my hate....i figure with med school startin in about a month, i wont have time anymore to air my greivances with u ppl thru my away messages..this page will keep the hate i spew alive for all time.....

      i officially knew i was in memphis when i turned on abc last night and instead of "friends" they were playing "martin"  celebrity sightings from my first night in memphis: the funky lookin dude who married liza manelli, i dont know what the hell his name is but he looks like a plastic figurine....and he always wears those sunshades, he was wearin them last night  some guys from the world series of poker...they all looked like dicks, but had the hottest bitches with them.....apparently chicks dig dudes with money, who would have thunk it....  and of course, no night in memphis is complete without spotting a member of the 3-6 mafia....i didnt recognize him since half the ppl in memphis look like theyre in the 3-6 mafia, however, having a jersey with the number "666" and the name "lord infamous" across the back kind of  gave him away....  apparently the "finish line" in memphis also has the ridiculous sale rack in the back.....jacket for 5 bucks? thats amazing......tom g and nihar dont know what theyre missing  theres a "church's" chicken on every block....for obvious reasons....  i do my grocery shopping in arkansas?......  germantown puts me at ease......  the indians here r white as hell......their personalities i mean, not their skin color
