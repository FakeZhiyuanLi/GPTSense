      once upon ago, ka went around to explore the wide world, in hope to find a new land. she stumbled upon utopia, and settled down in a small province. she became the leader of the province, and ordered ppl around, train military, and do all sorts of things kings and queens would do...soon, her provice became bigger and bigger, and arts and sciences and economic and military flourished. the province became more powerful. as queen ka sits on her throne, she began pondering about what she really did. nothing, came the answer. and she decided to go back to homeland, giving up her throne, to where she should be, to the reality.  i came back to the reality indead, trying very hard to quit utopia. i did, with both my accounts. and now is trying to get back to my normal life. once i had..........nope, that's past.  problem is, going back to normal daily life is HARD. really, fucking hard.  now i am addicted to blogs. i mean, designing blogs. i know i still suck at it, but is trying to learn all by myself.   everytime i got addicted i just sort of think about something all the time, and don't want to quit it and...addicted physically as well as emotionally. but the problem is  that i KNEW that i was addicted and i KNEW i was squandering my time, and i KNEW that the thing i am addicted to is actually not so brilliant but i still AM addicted.   im still trying to get back...to the reality. internet has offered me too many worlds...once, metropolis..now, utopia...and lots more...i am like quite lost in those worlds...but well, i ALWAYS knew what i am doing..i guess that i need time, that's all.

      听说你要考试了。而且是中考。也听说你有点紧张。  不过，不要紧。因为我会为你而祈祷。  我知道，你要的东西是绝对得的到的。所以，我很放心。  但是，有些东西离得太近，也是有危险的。

      比如，三四个从不让你失望的朋友。  有朋友，的确是件好事，就算两人再也不说话，再也不交流，还是朋友。而且，这种朋友，远远比身边那些开口就是废话，一开口就停不了的人好多了。  想说一些东西，却又说不出来。  我只能深深祝福。

      感觉差不多。  现在，每天都待在家里， 看电视， 看电脑，看书，看报纸。也没做什么。   现在，注意力很不集中，做一件事时，很容易应思想开小差，而去做另外的事。  做了好多事，但好象又没做什么。怪。  好象时间真的过得好快，不知不觉，一天过去了。一天，两天，一个星期，两个星期。就这样过去了。  好象自己明明知道终点站在哪里， 但又在迷宫里打圈子。但又想走出迷宫。矛盾，但又合理。  也许，就向我所说的， 我转了一个湾。

      bought the whole set of LOTR. watching now.truely madly deeply in love with aragorn. not viggo, but aragorn. viggo is really a good actor. honestly..i mean, ALL the actors from the fellowship to small little characters like the ppl in the prancing pony..they all are very good actors...except maybe haldir. er..haldir ist supposed to be so proud and arogant...  another thing, lotr should be watched in cinema to actually have maximun visual effects.  the seat chosen is crucial as well.  should be the last row of the cinema. so that you can have 3d hearing effect.even home cinema isn't good enough...  and of course the best of among three is two towers. er fellowship is rather dry..and return of king too sad..

      and i realised that what i really needed was to talk. not communication in other ways, but communication by talking..open my mouth and talk. i realised i don't know HOW TO talk now, which is...quite a ...something to be taken note of. sometimes when i roamed the shopping centre alone, i had a sudden urge of talking to someone, talking to someone i am comfortable with, talking to someone with a flowing conversation which i don't need time to think about what to reply or how to reply(i ALWAYS have got to screw up my brain thinking about that during conversations) i don't know...but one thing i know is that it will never happen. for one thing, NO ONE is going to roam these shopping centres with me, and the another thing, ONLY my best friend can make me at ease during a conversation. sometimes we talk with our hearts. a lot more things can be said during silence.   bought the whole set of lotr vcd just now, from MJ. that's my favourite music shop. favourite bookshop? MPH. mainly because of these two's atmosphere, and the things they sell. MJ has got soooooooooo many jazz cds, more than any other shop i knew of, and MPH has got soooo many versions of LOTR, and soooo many books(much more than popular), and sometimes (especially the one in raffles city) it will have jazz. god that's really nice. i basically enjoyed the silence when i am roaming these shops..but i realised my need to talk as well. i think that (even though i DON'T like) i need to learn how to communicate with others more efficiently. how to bring across my ideas clearly to my audience...how to TALK. the art of TALKING or CRAPPING. god knows how much i suck at crapping...  i don't know, but when i saw txy online i just felt like talking so much to her, and a lot of topics i wanna talk about and all these topics just like exploded in my mind and i am like...typing soooo quickly...and trying to make her understand all the things, and jumped from this topic to another, and i am like..well, nvm.  i know i can pick on anybody to talk these crap, but txy is someone i felt QUITE comfortable talking with. she is.. okay, but well, much better than anybody else..mainly its because..im to proud or what..i just sort of flinched away from someone i don't feel comfortable with, or look down on. i know. i am too proud. i looked down on too many ppl. that's bad. but i just am who i am. and its soooo common for me too look down on ppl. i even look down on my friends. well, sometimes...  and i looked down on ppl whom most ppl liked. well, if he is really good than i won't but most of the times i managed to see the darker side of ppl. i think that is..pretty sort of not-a-very-good-thing, because i am like..seeing the dark side of everyone and not been able to feel very bright as well. i mean, when you find something not-very-good about someone, i won't feel very happy, and you won't feel very nice and good and comfortable right? of course bright things make me brighter too. i used to live at the end of the corridor of the 4th floor, and the whole corrider actually has pretty girls living in the rooms and everytime i saw them i just felt very happy, very relaxed, very comfortable, and brighter as well. i don't know, but when you see bright side of world, you'll feel nicer..

      「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  A CHAT WITH GOD  God : Hello. Did you call me?  Me : Called you? No ... who is this?  God : This is GOD. I heard your prayers. So I thought I will chat.  Me : I do pray. Just makes me feel good. I am actually busy now. I am in the midst of something ...  God : What are you busy at? Ants are busy too.  Me : Don't know. But I can't find free time. Life has become hectic. It's rush hour all the time. 「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  God : Sure. Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you results. Activity consumes time. Productivity frees it.  Me : I understand. But I still can't figure out. By the way, I was not expecting YOU to buzz me on instant messaging chat.  God : Well, I wanted to resolve your fight for time, by giving you some clarity. In this net era, I wanted to reach you through the medium you are comfortabl 「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  e with 「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  Me : Tell me, why has life become complicated now?  God : Stop analyzing life. Just live it. Analysis is what makes it complicated.  Me : Why are we then constantly unhappy?  God : Your today is the tomorrow that you worried about yesterday. You are worrying because you are analyzing. Worrying has become your habit.That's why you are not happy.   「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  Me : But how can we not worry when there is so much uncertainty?  God : Uncertainty is inevitable, but worrying is optional.  Me : But then, there is so much pain due to uncertainty ...  God : Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.  Me : If suffering is optional, why do good people always suffer? 「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  God : Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don't suffer. With that experience their life become better not bitter.  Me : You mean to say such experience is useful?  God : Yes. In every terms, Experience is a hard teacher. She gives the test first and the lessons afterwards.  「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  Me : But still, why should we go through such tests? Why cant we be free from problems?  God : Problems are Purposeful Roadblocks Offering Beneficial Lessons to Enhance Mental Strength. Inner strength comes from struggle and endurance, not when you are free from problems.  Me : Frankly, in the midst of so many problems, we don't know where we are heading..   「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  God : If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Look inside. Looking outside, you dream. Looking inside, you awaken. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides insight.  Me : Sometimes not succeeding fast seems to hurt more than moving in the right direction. What should I do?    「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  God : Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you. Knowing the road ahead is more satisfying than knowing you rode ahead. You work with the compass. Let others work with the clock.  Me : In tough times, how do you stay motivated?   「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  God : Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing.  Me : What surprises you about people?  「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  God : When they suffer they ask, "Why me?" When they prosper, they never ask "Why me". Everyone wishes to have truth on their side, but few want to be on the side of the truth.  Me : Sometimes I ask, Who am I, Why am I here. I can't get the answer.  「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  God : Seek not to find who you are, but to determine who you want to be. Stop looking for a purpose as to why you are here. Create it. Life is not a process of discovery but a process of creation.  Me : How can I get the best out of life?  「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说： God : Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear.   Me : One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered.  God : There are no unanswered prayers. At times the answer is NO. 「???2」 ηλεκτρον[electricity]// it's GREEK to me [pun]         [more slogging* days to school reopening] 说：  Me : Thank you for this wonderful chat. I am so happy to start the New Day with a new sense of inspiration.  God : Well. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Don't believe your doubts or doubt your beliefs. Life is a mystery to solve not a problem to resolve. Trust me : Life is wonderful if you know how to live.  「???2」  ARE YA READY KIDS FOR SCHOOL?!?

      再一次的断绝。  死了那么多次。  好象还以为自己还在的时候。我疯狂的要找回自己，那个不在现实中的自己。好象被夹在现实和虚幻， 但我知道只能在当中选一个。  真的很难就这么说byebye..

      Getting personal with psychology  personality: the organized psychological and physical components inside a person that create and determine theat individual's unique characteristics and behaviour. it creates and determines what you do.  memories: 1, conscious--aware of thing that are current at the moment 2, preconscious--ordinary memories (eg, birthdays, how to ride a bike)..we are rarely aware of our memories in the preconscious. 3, unconscious--memories and experiences that we're not aware of, deepest and most basic desires that you're not even aware of them urself.  *conscious, preconscious, and unconscious memories help make you unique, giving you personality  id, ego, and superego 1, id--contains all of our most basic animal and primitive impulses that demand satisfaction, driven by a force called the libido. 2, ego--mediate between id's demands and the reality. harness the id's power, regulating it in order to achieve satisfaction despite the limits of reality. 3, superego--conscience. expects ego to be strong and effective against libido, from our parents or a parental figure.  * evil men do what good men only dream of.
