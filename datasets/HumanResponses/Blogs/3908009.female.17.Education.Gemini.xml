      I don't know what I was thinking 'Til I was thinking of you I don't remember a thing before I opened my eyes And you came into view I don't know what I was doing When there was nothing to do Must've been waiting for someone, baby Now I can see - I was waiting for you  I'd give up my sight just to see you I'd beg, I would borrow and steal I'd cut off my hands just to touch you And tear out my heart so you'd know how I feel There's nowhere that I wouldn't follow There's nothing that I wouldn't do 'Cause I wouldn't wanna be me If I didn't have you  Driving myself to distraction Until you got in my way I was just whistling Dixie 'til you struck up the band And they started to play I don't know how I was living Until you came in my life I always knew there was something wrong Then you came along Baby, you made it right  I'd give up my sight just to see you I'd beg, I would borrow and steal I'd cut off my hands just to touch you And tear out my heart so you'd know how I feel There's nowhere that I wouldn't follow There's nothing that I wouldn't do 'Cause I wouldn't wanna be me If I didn't have you  I was alone in the silence 'Til I was hearing your voice I couldn't see my way clear until you parted the clouds And you gave me a choice I couldn't pick up the pieces 'Til I was falling apart I didn't know I was bleeding 'Til your love fixed this hole, baby, here in my heart  I'd give up my sight just to see you I'd beg, I would borrow and steal I'd cut off my hands just to touch you And tear out my heart so you'd know how I feel There's nowhere that I wouldn't follow There's no place that I'd rather be This life without you would be hollow This love is a gift, and you gave it to me All that I am, you have made me And baby, I know that it's true I'd give it all up in a heartbeat Just to spend every moment with you There's no place that I wouldn't follow There's nothing that I wouldn't do 'Cause I wouldn't wanna be me If I didn't have you    mooshie, i only WISH i had the skills to write something so amazing. so until i can do such a thing, i'll just borrow words from these other more talented people..lol...love..

      I had no choice but to hear you You stated your case time and again I thought about it  You treat me like I´m a princess I´m not used to liking that You ask how my day was      Chorus: You´ve already won me over in spite of me Don´t be alarmed if I fall head over feet Don´t be surprised if I love you for all that you are I couldn´t help it It´s all your fault      Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole You´re so much braver than I gave you credit for That´s not lip service   You've already won me over inspite of me dont be alarmed if i fall head over feet dont be surprised if i love you for all that you are i couldnt help it its all your fault  You are the bearer of unconditional things You held your breath and the door for me Thanks for your patience     You´re the best listener that I´ve ever met You´re my best friend Best friend with benefits    What took me so long     I´ve never felt this healthy before I´ve never wanted something rational I am aware now I am aware now   TASH IN later much  CHEERS(B)

I WANNA DO THAT! MOFO!! LETS DO IT!!! hahahahhaa...well anywhos...then we went some other places, dad had some errands to run, then we got home and he needed some help with the car. last summer i helped out a little bit at my dad's friends penzzoil so i'm quite familiar with some ways to care for the engine. like changing the oil, checking the transmission fluid, blah blah blah, so i helped him with that. the chrysler needed some helpage and cleanage and he needed my help. so thats what i did when i got back home. then around 6:30 i came upstairs and sat down for a bit. i was so dizzy. its the heat i tell ye! shoo...i still have a little bit of a headache...gaah! advil! i need some serious advil stat!  kk i got my advil. takes a bit to work...while i wait for it to kick in u can read the lyrics to this song....:  Some people live for the fortune  Some people live just for the fame  Some people live for the power, yeah  Some people live just to play the game  Some people think that the physical things define what’s within  And I been there before but that’s life’s a bore, so full of the superficial   Chorus:  Some people want it all, but I don’t want nothing at all  If it aint you baby, if I aint got you baby  Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything  But everything means nothing if I aint got you, yeah   Some people search for a fountain  The promise is forever young  (You know) Some people need 3 dozen roses  And that’s the only way to prove you love them  Hand me the world on a silver platter  And what good would it be?  With no one to share with no one who truly cares for me   Chorus:  Some people want it all, but I don’t want nothing at all  If it aint you baby, if I aint got you baby  Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything  But everything means nothing if I aint got you, you, you  Some people want it all, but I don’t want nothing at all  If it aint you baby, if I aint got you baby  Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything  But everything means nothing if I aint got you, yeah   If aint got you with me baby, ohh, ooo  Say nothing in this whole wide world don’t mean a thing  If I aint got you with me baby.  -Alicia Keys  GOD that song is amazing!

      Put your head on my shoulder  Hold me in your arms,  baby  Squeeze me oh so tight  Show me that you love me too   Put your lips next to mine, dear  Won't you kiss me once, baby  Just a kiss goodnight, may be  You and I will fall in love   People say that love's a game  A game you just can't win  If there's a way  I'll find it someday  And then this fool will rush in   Put your head on my shoulder  Whisper in my ear, baby  Words I want to hear  Tell me, tell me that you love me too.   Put your head on my shoulder  Whisper in my ear, baby  Words I want to hear, baby  Put your head on my shoulder   -Paul Anka  TASH IN later  much  CHEERS(B)

      Since the moment I spotted you Like walking 'round with little wings on my shoes My stomach's filled with the butterflies...(oo)and it's alright Bouncin round from cloud to cloud I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down If I said I didn't like it then you'd know I'd lied  Pre-Chorus Everytime I try to talk to you I get tongue-tied Turns out that everything I say to you Comes out wrong and never comes out right  Chorus So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever Heads we will and tails we'll try again So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven Cause without you they're never going to let me in  When's this fever gonna break? I think I've handled more than any man can take I'm like a love-sick puppy chasin you around (oo)And it's alright Bouncin round from cloud to cloud I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down If I said I didn't like it then you'd know I'd lied  Pre-Chorus Everytime I try to talk to you I get tongue-tied Turns out that everything I say to you Comes out wrong and never comes out right  Chorus So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever Heads we will and tails we'll try again So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven Cause without you they're never going to let me in  ( Only second time through) And slowly I begin to realize this is never gonna end Right about the same time you walk by And I say 'Oh here we go again' oh  Pre-Chorus Everytime I try to talk to you I get tongue-tied Turns out that everything I say to you Comes out wrong and never comes out right  Chorus So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever Heads we will and tails we'll try again So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven Cause without you they're never going to let me in  So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever Heads we will and tails we'll try again So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven Cause without you they're never going to let me in   ---Santana feat.

      I dig my toes into the sand The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket I lean against the wind, pretend that I am weightless And in this moment I am happy Happy  I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were...here  I lay my head onto the sand The sky resembles a back-lit canopy with holes punched in it I'm counting UFO's, I signal them with my lighter And in this moment i am happy Happy  I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were...here Wish you were here  The world's a rollercoaster And I am not strapped in Maybe I should hold with care But my hands are busy in the air, saying  I wish you were here I wish you were... I wish you were here I wish you were here I wish you were...here Wish you were here

      once again. the title has nothing to do with the blog.  so my day goes like this.  woke up at 8. i thought i was goin driving at 9. but nooo....i had to be all lazy and not write it down yesterday. it was actually at 10. so i woke up an hour early for no reason. soo gay. ok.   after the drive, came home and ate some b-fast. i was online talking to buddies, when the "know it all man who helped my mother conceive me" came out and started freakin out at me. i swear to GOD that man is gonna be the end of me! ggaahh!! so he freaks out and he's all "NATASHA PARVEEN! U NEVER LISTEN TO A WORD I SAY! GET READY! WE'RE GOIN TO SUPERSTORE!" and me being the stubborn talker-backer to that man that i am, i said a couple of nasty things meself. but thast a different story. lets just say there was a lot of "cussing" back and forth. so yes we fought. DER! its the goddang usual round here. i hate him.  so while i'm in superstore shopping away, some people start screaming "DIAL 911! DIAL 911! QUICKLY! SOMEBODDY STOP HER!" and i look around the corner and this lady's stealing from superstore. couple minutes later we heard the cops come and get her.   while i was walking down the oriental section, my phone rang. so i took it outta my bag and guess who it was? MOFO! [gotta get a new nickname for u] so we talked for like 2 mins [definitely not long enough] but i promised i'd call after i got home. and i did. and we talked. not for long tho. his dad got home and he had to go:(  so then around 5 laine came and got me and we went for a swim. shit man these nasty old men that are so damn hory are soo nasty! there were these 3 guys [nasty old men by the way] and they were totally looking at us. eeewww....  on the other hand, the sexiest lifeguard was oogoling laine and i. hahah! we were thinking "make up ure mind buddy" cause he kept looking at me then her and me and her. it was just hillarious to watch. he was hot tho. crazy tattoo on his back...RED DRAGON....ggahh....*drool*...lol. naw he wasnt that hot. he was alrighty. he looked like lance bass from n'sync. pretty cute. not the kinda looks i go for. laine on the other hand was enjoying his attention. hahah! go team laine!  soo all of that aside. today was a mediocre day. we met this cute couple at the pool too. they looked so happy together. *sigh* ME TOO! LEMME BE HAPPY!  so thas it for now. i'll prolly be back later on.  TASH IN later much  CHEERS(B)   >

(huh?) ok anyways...no sleep no relaxation no food. thats fucked up. woops! i mean fuzked up [see u can swear in secret. its not that difficult]  theres nothing good on the telly. i could go and watch a dvd or something but that requires a lot of movement and co-ordination to get to the tv and dvd player and put the dvd in and ....GAH! it gives me a headache to even think bout moving from this spot.  was it hot last night or what? geeze. dang [  i'm still diggin this dude. soo awesome. soo funny. soooooo cute...*drool* and respectful too. unless i'm being taking on a wild goose chase and being made to think that this guy is what i'm actually thinking he is. shit. i hope thats not the situation. i really like this guy. DAMNIT!  so my instructor says i'm ready for my road test. all i could do was laugh when he told me that. shit i suck. well not really i kick ass at driving but still. holy toleto.   well thas it for now. i'll write more later. gonna go find something to do.

Just remember You're the one thing  I can't get enough of  So I'll tell you something  This could be love because   'Cause I had the time of my life No I've never felt this way before Yes I swear it's the truth And I owe it all to you 'Cause I've had the time of my life And I've searched through every open door Till I found the truth and I owe it all to you    Now I've had the time of my life No I never felt this way before  Never Felt this way  Yes I swear it's the truth and I owe it all to you  "cause I've had the time of my life No I've never felt this way before Yes I swear it's the truth And I owe it all to you  'Cause I had the time of my life And I've searched through every open door Till I've found the truth and I owe it all to you -------------------------------------------------------------  that is a song of course. i cant write THAT well. crickey. so i'm here listening to some music and just sitting round. i cant belive this! its the second night that i cant sleep. its fuckin 4 in the morning. jebus! well i'm feelin kinda lazy and dont feel like writing anything else. i'm gonna go. watch some leno.

      ok so this is the shizzle. its 2:30 in the morning. i cant sleep. absolutely CANNOT sleep. my last blog was so retarted. i dont know what i was thinking when i wrote it. i was just confused. had some thoughts on my mind that i needed to be set straight. and that happened tonight or last night if you will so i feel so much better.  well this is what i did today or yesterday or whatever well anyways, i went to the mall with mooshie. we had to bring the dogs along cause well my FATHERS an asshole. he wants to deprive me of the pathetic excuse of a social life i have created for myself. he wasnt letting me out of the house unless i brought the dogs along with me. sad really. well mooshie was super cool bout it. he wanted to "meet them" apparantly. well we all had our fun. first we went to the library cause p-puppy adn a-dawg needed to return over-due shizzle. then they took some books and videos out. afterwards we hit the mall. that was fun. we ate went to the pet store just the usual u kno? well after that mooshie drove us home. i sent p-puppy and a-dawg upstairs and mooshie and i sat and talked in his car for a while. we did come upstairs for a bit to get something to drink and yes well just show mooshie my place. he said he had to get going but really he had to pee. the funny thing was a-dawg was in the shower and mooshie didnt wanna go pee in the bathroom while a-dawg was in it showering. lol. it was so funny! well we went downstairs and mooshie decided to "water the plants outdoors" lol! HAHAH! so he stayed a while longer. we did laundry together. THAT IS HOT! i've always had this fantasy that my boyfriend and i would be doing laundry together, well our laundry not my family's laundry and it kinda sorta happened today. he was standing there while i was loading the dryer. that counts right? he did kiss me tho in the room. which was a PLUS PLUS(Y)!  alright so after laundry, mooshie and i sat and talked for about another hour and 45 mins. which didnt seem that long. honeslty when i'm with him hours pass but it feels like 5 mins. its just not enough time! damnit! i cant wiat till school starts. i'll have an excuse to be out and with him all the time. MUHAHAHHA! but when he has to head off to college he'll be so busy and we might not have as much time together as we'd like. well we'll see when september comes round.  yea so then we sat and "talked"...i'll leave it at that.  he called me later and we talked for a bit but then he got real sleepy so i MADE him go to bed. HAHAHHA!   and now i'm up. i cant sleep. i watched t.v. a couple of movies listened to some music. NADA nothing seems to be helping me get to sleep. i dunno wat it is. well watever it is i hope it passes soon. i need to catch me some Z's!  thats it for now eh. my hands are getting tierd of typing so much. i'll write again later on today.  g'night to all...  TASH IN later much  CHEERS(B)  I FEEL PRETTY AND WITTY AND LOVELY.....well watever the words are. ya'll know that commercial right?  P.S. i'm not sure cause i've never really felt this way before but i honest to GOD with my whole entire being even my ugly toes SWEAR that i think I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE! i know it seems crazy but thats how i feel. i hope he feels the same way. and if he does i'd appreaciate it if he told me :D  HAPPY 3 WEEKS BABY!!

      ok yea the title has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with this blog. lol. it just seemed funny.  i'm trying to stay funny to stay sane. i might blow up soon. theres too much shit going on. i know i can help all of it and just stop everything and fix it. but i cant bring myself to do any of that. i think i have to throw up. i honestly feel sick to my stomach. my brains going to just pop. i'm not going to do anything extreme like kill myself beucase thats stupid. plus suicide is a sin. i cant afford to screw up the good deeds i've been doing for the past little while. [good deeds? yea right!]  so anyways, on a lighter note, the BBQ went great! fireworks were amazing. i still cant believe sweden won though. i was rootin for spain, but oh well, next year i guess. i was lying bout 2 feet away from the water and i was watching fireworks in the sky. it was amazing! cept for the fact that i kept thinking bout how much fun wednesday was. when i wasnt lying on my cousin but on my mooshie. THAT was good(Y)  thas it for now  i feel like shit

      i apologize to all those i have offended with my nasty title. *bow* its just been a horrific week.   THE MAN THAT HELPED MY MA TO CONCEIVE ME is being a jerk-off, as usual. he fuckin accuses me of stealing money from him. now why the hell would i steal money from HIM when ma gives me all the money i need. for crying the fuck out loud! jebus!!! anyways, he accuses me of stealing his money and then he declares that i'm not allowed to go out with friends. fuck that shit. i went out anyways. i went to the fireworks. honestly that was the highlight of my whole week. other than that this week was a total mess. i already wrote about the fireworks in my last blog so i wont write bout it again. but it was great nonetheless. GOD the ride home was good, eh babe? lol.  anyways, besides my dad being a  stupid fuck, my "best friend" flew in on wednesday. hes messing up my life. i SWEAR to GOD. he comes back thinking that we're still together. which was OVER LAST FUCKING YEAR! good GOD! some ppl just dont know how to let go of some things eh? anyways, now hes mentally guilt-trippin on me to make me feel like shit for doing something for myself. which is compeltely gay. i'm trying real hard to keep from killing him. crickey. watever, he can burn in hell.  other than that my weeks been pretty shitty too yea. i dont know who i was kidding thinking that this week was ok. shit.   well tomorrow should be good. we're going to a BBQ then to the fireworks. but GOD hates me too. its apparantly going to be raining tomorrow. like WHAT THE FUCK?!?! the one thing i look forward to for the weekend, and its probably going to get cancelled. sometimes when shit happens, SHIT REALLY HAPPENS! kick me while i'm down eh GOD? i sound like a fuckin depressed person. all this swearing and jazz i apologize bout. ya'll know i dont swear so much naturally. i'm just pissed off right now cause FATHER just siad i cant go out tonight. i was spsed to go watch "harold and kumar" with mooshie. but i guess that isnt happening. wat a fucker. I HATE YOU YOU PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR A DAD! shit.  i should stop before u ppl start getting scared of me. and yes ppl natasha does have a dark scary side. everyone does. if u havent found ure dark scary side yet, theres something wrong with you. so go take ure damn time to find it. sometimes its good to get all the shit off of ure mind. else it just keeps building and building until u blow up. like me. i've decided that hence forth i'll start showing more of my upset emotions instead of being a fucking push-over and letting certain ppl get away with everything and all the shit they do to me. fuck this. GOD. i need feeds.  once agian i apologzie for all the cursing. its really not like me.   later  love u babe.

      ok well lately everytime i've come on here, i've been putting songs up for my mooshie. although that is a great joy for me, i decided to blog today instead of putting a song.   well let us see......  on friday i went to go watch the village with mooshie. movie was slow but plot was good. got me thinking. and i was sitting there with mooshie which was EGGCELELNT! hes so cute.  on saturday i went to marilyn's. it was her birthday. shes 59 now. amazing lady. i hope shes around for a long long time. we had an amazing time. food, music, swimming pool, discussing boys and love, it was so much fun! shes such a wise and great person to talk to about anything. i love her to death. and that party was fun too.   sunday was a slow day. i went to the mall for a bit to "feed the dawgs" [MOOSHIE!!] lol. saw alaina there. she was trying to make small talk but i tried to make it was "small" as possible. afterwards i got home and just sat around. it was so boring! but i talked to mooshie until about 12. which was a plus plus. (Y)  today's just begun. ma came into the room at 10 and started talking to me about something. i'm not sure what it was but she started teling me something. and then my cousin called on my cell and she started tlaking to him. i was just lying there cuddling up against ma. i havent done that in ages. sometimes it slips my mind how much of a wonderful mothers shes been. just lying there made me realize that there have been so many times that i took her for granted. its quite sad actually. now i know to appreaciate her more. shes so comfy. lol. ma, i love you.  so thats about it for now. mooshies probably up already but doing something or watching t.v. or sitting on the porch or on the computer but not online. who knows eh? he said he'd call later.  i'm not sure bout wats goin on tonight. prolly chillin wiht mooshie. *tash crosses her fingers*  thas it for now. i'm done blogging.  TASH IN later much  CHEERS(B)  \m/(-_-)\m/=>ROCK ON! hahahahhaha coco!! i stole it! sorry:(!      i need you baby, if its quite alright, i need you baby to warm the lonely nights, i love you baby trust in me when i say ok....i love you baby.....[so addicted to that song]
