       What a great Christmas gift!  A talking George W. Bush  urlLink doll!   There are others to choose from as well if you are not too keen on George W., check out the Rumsfeld, or Clinton doll.  There is an Ann Coulter and a Dennis Miller doll as well.  How great, I love it!  One for everyone!  I think my friend (you know who you are!) would love the Clinton doll, I'm just afraid what she might do to it...

       Well, it seems that Alabama is not the only state having problems with religous monuments...In August, around the time that the Ten Commandments monument was moved out of the Alabama Judicial Building in Montgomery because of a federal judge's ruling that it was too much of a religious statement for government property, Ms. Blanca Castillo petitioned county commissioners in Fort Worth, Texas, to remove a statue in front of the county's administrative building because it was insulting of religion. The  urlLink offending statue , of a sleeping panther, struck Ms. Castillo as too paganistically feline, and therefore "sinister," and she recommended a statue of something else, such as a steer.

       I love the 70's!  Remember your first  urlLink Lite Brite ?  It was never long before you had already poked holes through all of the patterns that came with the Lite Brite and half of the colored pegs were missing.  You'd beg for more, but Mom would only give you a piece of black contstruction paper to use.  That's not the same! MAN.  We sure had it hard back then...:)

       OK, I just don't get it!  Britney swears that she doesn't think of herself as a sex icon, she just doesn't think that way, "it's weird!" she says.  Then she poses for Esquire magazine wearing almost nothing!  Check out the  urlLink pictures.   Amazing.  She's just posing like that for inspiration, and really only thinking of the children.  She's almost like Mother Teresa, don't you think?  Well, except for the beads...

        urlLink What is Your Soul Worth?  My soul is worth Â£69813. For my peace of mind, 7% of people have a purer soul than me.   Interesting.  So, apparently my soul is worth 116,302.61 in US Dollars.  Well, I guess the good news is that only 7% of the people out there have a purer soul than mine.  That's a fact, it's in writing!  So, what is your soul worth?  Let me know.

       Well, it was our every day ordinary weekend.  Not much happening here.  I have been plagued by the butter in the shoes all weekend.  What could that possibly be about?!  I don't know, I hope one day to have that answer.   Anyway, I was following the story about the twin  urlLink Egyptian boys  who were connected at the head.  2 years old and they were joined at the head.  Apparently the surgery went very well and the prognosis is good.  I really hope it all works out.  I just can't even begin to imagine...  So,  urlLink Kill Bill  came out this weekend.   It hit number 1 right away.  I really want to go see this movie, I love Quentin Tarantino.  He looks at things so differently then most people.  Very interesting guy.  I have heard that it is extremely bloody and gory, he usually has a bit of that in his movies, but I guess he goes above and beyond in this one.  The second part to this thriller comes out in February.  Speaking of movies, I'm also anxiously awaiting The Return of the King.  This is the third and final part of the Tolkien trilogy,  urlLink The Lord of the Rings .  It is due out in theatres on December 17th, that is a Wednesday and only 65 days away.  But who's counting?   Well, anyway, enough of the chit chat for this morning.

        urlLink Stockholm, Sweden AP -- It's buttered sole -- but definitely not of the seafood variety. A couple hiking in the mountains of far northern Sweden found 70 pairs of shoes, all filled with butter. Officials have no idea who put the shoes there, or why. A provincial spokesman says the buttered footwear ranges from sneakers to boots. There are even butter-filled high heels and tap shoes. Each contains about a pound of butter. The province spokesman says they'd like to catch the person who did it and make them clean it up. He says it's going to create quite a mess when the butter starts to spoil. Officials say they'll wait for snow, so they can get a snowmobile into the area.  Aliens? :)

       Well, my friend Tricia has just started her very own  urlLink Blog  and I love it!  So, I am going to give this a try as well.  I will be writing about things that interest me (remember, I am only here to amuse myself) and a few things that might interest others as well.  Anyway, it will be trial and error until I get it all worked out - SO be patient!  We shall see....  OK, a little about me...I am a working mother of 2 beautiful children.  Alex is 6 and Lauren is 2 (She'll be 3 in a month).  I am married to my best friend Steve, he is a wonderful husband and father.  We've been married now for 8 years.  We've made it past the 7 year itch, right?  I work in the purchasing department of a large company in Huntsville, Alabama.  We have lived in Alabama now for 7 years, moving here from Canton, Ohio in October of 1996.  I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Kent State University in Kent Ohio (which I am not using at all, except to win vague trivia questions about artists...).  So now I am also becoming a Blogger, to add to my resume!  Anyway, more to come.

Oh well...what can you do about it.  SO...Just needed a quick little vent there.  I don't want to go on, cause that won't help...Hope everyone is having a good day!

       OK, so my friend Tricia was reading this Blog and said "What's all this about the Buckeyes and the BCS?  What is it?"  I said "Tricia, you're such a girl!" :)  So, I'm wondering, does everyone know what the BCS is and what I'm talking about?  Let me give a few details and explanations just in case...  So, it's all about College Football!  The NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association), the Ohio State Buckeyes and the BCS (Bowl Championship Series).  I love College Football.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not a Superfan, I just enjoy watching it, and even more so when the Buckeyes are doing well.  OSU is not my Alma Mater (I graduated from Kent State University, not much to watch in college football), but since I am from Ohio, I am by natural rights a Buckeye.   urlLink Article from the NCAA News - includes a history of the BCS.   So, long story short....Before the BCS there was never (or very rarely) a championship game.  There would be a #1 team and a #2 team in the polls, but these 2 teams would not pair off and play each other.  Therefore leaving an inconclusive National Champion.  That's no way to end the season, who's to know what would happen if these top 2 teams would play?  So the BCS guarantees that the top 2 teams will play each other in that years Championship bowl.  Make sense?  Another reason that the BCS was started was to make the rankings more subjective instead of objective, all of the other polls are ranked according to sport's writers, coachs and others, while the BCS is comp[uter generated on stats from each of the teams.  So that's the quickie version of it, as far as I know it anyway...hope it clears things up.

       First, a quick update....Ohio State is number 2 in the  urlLink BCS  series!  WOW, they did manage to pull up because of their Strength of Schedule scoring!  Woo Hoo!

       Here's some more updated info on  urlLink the BCS ....  Everything is still up in the air, it could go many different ways.  I'm pulling for the Buckeye's and hope they will come off with a win this weekend against Michigan.  They will be playing in Michigan at 12:00 eastern time.  Anyway, if the Buckeye's manage to pull it off and beat Michigan (#8) they can move up to #2 in the BCS and will be playing Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl.  If they lose to Michigan...who knows.  Anyway, just wanted to update y'all.  Everyone root for the Buckeyes!   urlLink My earlier post on the BCS with a link.

       Has anyone ever heard of this new "sport"?  Here is a blurb on it from the website:  Geocaching is an entertaining adventure game for gps users. Participating in a cache hunt is a good way to take advantage of the wonderful features and capability of a gps unit. The basic idea is to have individuals and organizations set up caches all over the world and share the locations of these caches on the internet. GPS users can then use the location coordinates to find the caches. Once found, a cache may provide the visitor with a wide variety of rewards. All the visitor is asked to do is if they get something they should try to leave something for the cache.   Anyway, I've stumbled upon this awhile back and I've always wanted to go get a GPS system to do this!  It sounds like a lot of fun to me, a treasure hunt!  They are all over the US and we could do it while we were traveling, or just take a weekend and do it around here.  Check this out and let me know if you are interested, we could start doing this, great Christmas gift idea...

       In Windsor, Ontario at Leopards Lounge and Broil, they are staging a  urlLink dwarf throwing contest ...well sure.  Sounds just fine and dandy right?  Apparently Renaldo Agostino is helping to stage this event and he is a dwarf.  "It's all a matter of personal opinion" he says.  Anyway, the legislature is now trying to pass a bill to make this event illegal.  Hmmm, guess I just would have thought that....well nevermind, guess you just have to make it a law for some people.

       So OK, yes I am one of those people that occasionally check out my horoscope, so OK, it is set up on my Homepage for me to refer to constantly, but I don't always do that.  Anyway, here's what mine says today...   urlLink ARIES  In a series of days that have tested your patience to the limits, here comes the moment of truth that could make or break you. You can expect a high-pressure day, where you'll be induced to express your deepest motivations. A confrontation with an authority figure could trigger an outburst. Do your best to remain levelheaded, dear Aries.      It's just soo funny to me, because I am having an extremely hard time today, trying not to go off on the next unsuspecting person to walk into my lair, I mean office.  Anyay, check out  urlLink your horoscope  and see what it says.  Sometimes it just rings so close to reality it makes you wonder...

       OK, if you ever get a Plantars wart, take care of it right away!  The shot they gave me in the bottom of my foot hurt so bad I screamed.  Childbirth was easy, the shot in my foot - that hurt!  But anyway, I survived and I lived to tell about it.  I'm just going to work a half day today and then head home to keep my foot up.  So, anyway, just wanted to let everyone know that I'm OK for now...

       So today I go into the Doctor at 4:00 to have a  urlLink Plantars Wart  removed from the bottom of my right foot.  It's really been bothering me, so I am very ready to have it removed....but, I'm also very nervous about having it done.  Apparently they will give me a shot on the bottom of my foot to numb it, and apparently this shot hurts pretty bad.  I am very afraid of shots...It's not a rational fear, but I am.  So I plan on popping a couple of my urlLink  Xanax  and heading on over there.  Hopefully that will ease some of this anxiety and make the whole procedure run smoother, we'll see.  Steve will pick me up after it is done and take me home.  There I will rest and not do anything tonight, I will have an excuse after all...

       OK, found a very interesting site today.  Here is a  urlLink Marilyn Manson  fan site.  Anyway, I was just checking it out and thought I would share it with everyone.  I just have this odd fascination with Marilyn Manson.  We went to high school together (Old  urlLink GlenOak  in Canton Ohio), he even signed my year book (woohoo!).  Anyway, I just have an almost obsession with him now.  I wonder if he still talks to anyone at all from high school?

       Well, I made it through the weekend...I was here for 12 hours on Saturday, and back in early Sunday morning.  I was able to get out of here at a fairly decent hour on Sunday and then had to go grocery shopping.  I am just exhausted today.  I am extremely frustrated, we are just really struggling with this new system at work.  They are just not ready to go LIVE with it yet, and somehow we are! AAAUUUGHHH!  Anyway, gotta get back to work...just needed to vent for a minute.  Bye.

       OK, so here it is, 9:10 am Saturday the 1st.  Where am I?  At work.  MAN.  We are going over to a new system here and we have to come in to migrate the data over.  How much fun is that?  So no big deal, except that I've been sitting here now for over an hour and still no word on when we might get started.  It is just so frustrating.  All day yesterday we were just waiting to get started.  Now, here we are again early this morning waiting.  We will be here alllllll weekend at this rate.  I expect that I will be here late tonight and back in early tomorrow morning to stay all day again tomorrow.  Hurry up and wait.  Anyway, just needed to vent for a minute...got to get back to waiting, something might happen soon.  Bye.

       Yeah, right! sure!  Anyway, each day I get a bit closer!  I will go shopping tonight and hopefully be able to finish it out! YEAH!  This weekend was a total waste...I got a really bad migraine on Friday, missed work (that part is not so bad...) then it carried over into Saturday!  Well I had been planning on going to the Tavern Christmas party for weeks, and then I miss it due to a migraine!  What a #@&!!!  Well anyway, the headache would not go away, I was miserable for 2 whole days and I am actually still sore from it....Oh well Life is a bitch and then you die, or something like that.    Well OK, here is a cool little Christmas site to check out... urlLink The Northpole.

       So much has been going on and I'm so far behind!  Sorry everyone.  Anyway, like I always say...I'm only here to amuse myself.  Actually that's my husband's line, but he doesn't read this anyway, so I can steal it!  So... I just added a new link on to the side over there...PUSH.  I bartended at a Christmas Party last Friday night and this was the band playing there that night.  They were really good.  It was such a fun night, the company that was holding the party was very laid back, and very good tippers (!!).   Then at the end of the night, the guys in the band played a special "Kelly" song!  How awesome!  They just made it up right there on the spot, it was soo cool.  It was my first song ever, so now they are my FAVORITE BAND ever!  Everyone needs to check them out!  I'll have to catch up with them again out somewhere.  Definetly.

We are going to Pauli's Chophouse...a wonderful restaurant, mmmmm.  I'm already hungry thinking of it.  Steve will get the kids and go home, he's so good isn't he?  Well, I think so anyway.  We've been so busy with everything going on here, it's nuts.  Trying to get ready for Christmas, stay afloat at work and help at Grandmothers...well it just takes alot out of you.  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? sure.  ANyway, just wanted to say a quick hello..must run! Bye!

So I've got so much work to catch up on...Just want to say hi...sorry that I've not kept up with this through the Holiday's but you know what they say...."Obesity is widespread".

       OK, well I just bought 2 new books at lunch time today.  I bought " urlLink Girl with a Pearl Earring " and " urlLink The Portrait of Dorian Gray ".  They both look very interesting...I will let you know.    I really want to start reading more books, make myself well-rounded, you know?  Anyway, it's a theory...but where to find the time....well I will work on it and we will see.

       So, I think we've ruled out a vacation for this year - besides that, we can't decide where or when we want to go.  I think we are going to focus on putting an addition on to our house - we want to enclose our back patio and make it part of the house.  So, next year is our 10 year anniversary and I think we will go to Europe then.  So, now we need to work on plans for the addition - that should be fun.  We'll see.

       OK - so much has been going on lately - where to start?    Well I spent the past 2 days running around with my 3 year old daughter Lauren.  She had  urlLink Nursemaids elbow  and it was not fun!  My poor little baby!  She was hurting so bad.  Monday night we were over at Grandmother's house (where we are every single day now, but that's another story...) and Patience (She's Grandmother's caregiver) was playing with Lauren and swinging her by the hands, we all do that with kids, right?  Well, we shouldn't ever do that, especially with Lauren.  So she gets her Nursemaids elbow and she is just miserable.  We try to put it back into place, but with no luck.  We take her home, give her plenty of Tylenol and Motrin and put her to bed.  She slept so-so, kept waking up every time she rolled near that arm.  So Tuesday morning then, I take her to the Pediatrician (The same pediatrician who told me that if I was a good mom I would take her out of daycare and stay home with her - yeah nice...I just haven't found a new pediatrician yet.) So they check out her arm and they are concerned it might be broke so they send me to the Medical Mall to go get X-rayed.  So we do that, then go back to the Pediatrician and they review the pictures - nothing is wrong.  They try again to put her arm back in place - still no luck.  So we leave, they make an appointment for me to go see an Orthopedic Dr. because they are very concerned that she keeps getting this (she used to get it when she was very little, but hasn't had it in almost a year and a half).  So I head into work to pick up my computer and some paperwork so I can work from home a bit - by the time we get into work, she's using her arm again and says it doesn't hurt anymore.  I guess they got it back into place again that last time.  CRAZY...  So yesterday I leave work, pick her up and drive to the Orthopedic Dr. where I wait for 2 hours to get in and talk to him for about 3 minutes... Him: "Why did the pediatrician send you here?" Me: "They were concerned it kept happening so often with her." Him: "No, that's what happens - there's no treatment for this, she'll just grow out of it." Me: "*&^^$&(^#$$%@#"  So I just wasted 2 hours and $25.00 - because my Pediatrician is a moron!    Oh well, so I took Lauren to McDonald's for a sundae and then back to Daycare....  AUGH.

       Well, not so much help, as I need suggestions...anyway, Steve and I are planning our first vacation.  We want to go somewhere different, that's not going to cost a huge fortune, and it will just be the 2 of us!  I'm so excited.  I just don't know where to go...I'm thinking maybe a cruise, or down to the Bahama's, or Cancun.  Also have considered New York City, Las Vegas and San Francisco.  So - please send me some suggestions!  I'm anxious to start planning!

       Hi there! It's been a very busy week.  We've had so much going on here at work and at home augh!  But anyway - supposed to go out tonight, so that should be fun.  I'm looking forward to it.  Not sure where we will be going yet.  I happen to know that  urlLink PUSH  will be playing down at  urlLink Sammy T's  tonight - and of course, they are now my favorite band ever since they made the Kelly song!  So, maybe I can get everyone down there.  That would be fun.  We'll see.  Not sure what else is going on around Huntsville...it's limited.  So anyway...got to run and get some work done!  Talk more later.

       So this weekend a friend of mine had a run in with his "girlfriend".  As it turns out, she's a psycho - which he somehow manages to end up with every time!  I don't get it - He's a very good looking guy, nice, funny, good job - well he works at the same place I do, so it's a decent job anyway...Yet, everytime, he seems to land the psychos!  Anyway...Here's a site to send  urlLink dead flowers  to your ex's!

       So over the Holiday's my friend Trish ended up battling with her bank and credit card companies - how lovely.  I know how awful this is, almost the exact same thing happened to me last year.  We were making monthly payments on a large bill, well apparently we were late one month - by 5 days - OH MY GOD!  So as we are getting ready to finally start our Christmas shopping on December 20th (I know, but we are always late starting it...) we discover that the $1500.00 that we thought was in our bank account (from selling some stock that I had) was nowhere to be found.  What possibly could have happened?  We had absolutely no earthly idea...we didn't realize we were late on that payment.  So after many calls we find out that the lawyers we were making payments to had seized all of our bank accounts and cleaned out everyone of them.  They didn't even have to notify us of this happening, they sued us and didn't even tell us!  Anyway, it all ended up fine and dandy - after many calls and what not, threats of more sueing blah, blah, blah...the lawyers finally sent us our money back.  Of course, we didn't get it back until after Christmas - nice.  So what can you do when stuff like this happens?  Are you just stuck?  Most importantly - How do you get revenge?  Well here is  urlLink one site  that might be able to help with that.  urlLink  Another site  to give you some ease...Anyway.  I don't know the answer.  All I know is that they can walk all over you without any trouble at all, they don't even have to tell you what they are doing.  Very nice.

       In the year of 2004 I hereby resolve....  ...to be a more positive and optimistic person. ( This one will be tough, but, I will try...) ...to keep my weight down.   ...to flatten my stomach by going to the gym more often.  Then, if I get my stomach flat I want to get it pierced.  (I just think that is sooo sexy.) ...to finally finish my kitchen.  (Painting the walls, redecorating, etc...) ...to start painting and drawing again.  And to take some art classes. ...spend more time with my kids playing. ...spend more one on one time with my husband! ;) ...write letters to my family and friends far away. ...be more organized!  Well, that seems to be a good start.  Now the tricky part - actually doing it!  We'll see.  I'll keep you updated and let you know how I'm doing.  OK

       I hope to get back in the swing of things now!  The Holiday's are over and we are back to our "normal" life.  How scary is that? VERY.  Anyway, it was a very nice Christmas, full of fun and festivities.  Well, OK, not so much festivities...but it wasn't a total bummer either.  So...Here we are in a brand new year and so much to look forward to!  Does anyone have any great resolutions they have made?  I haven't really made any yet....I need to do that - RIGHT NOW.    Let's see....here are some lists I found out on the web.... urlLink The American Jerk's Official New Years Resolutions.    urlLink Osama's list...(not real funny, but there are a couple in there...),   a  urlLink New Year's Resolution list  that I can relate to.

       I'm not mad at my husband anymore, obviously.  No I didn't get an apology...I just got over it.  Believe it or not - I  kinda  over reacted....I know, shocking that I would possibly do that.  I'm such a freak!  Anyway, thngs are back to normal - which are good - very good.  Just thought I'd keep you updated that my husband is not as big of an idiot as I felt that day!  He really is a great husband - Thank God - as well as being my best friend!

       Here's an interesting concept... urlLink The Giving Game.   Do good deeds for people, only with the request that they pass it on and do good deeds for some other person.  Pay it forward.  The Giving Game was inspired by Catherine Ryan Hyde's novel,  urlLink Pay It Forward.    Anyway, I think this is a great idea.  Check it out!

       SO here I am - MAD!  Sometimes, husbands can be complete idiots!  Anyway, I will not get into the how's and why's...Let's just leave it at - HE IS AN IDIOT!  I still love him, and I will get over this, but for today - AUGH.  I don't even know if he gets it - that's what is frustrating.  No, he knows, he knows he was wrong but he will not admit it and won't let it go.  As for me, I just do not want to talk about it.  I said my piece this morning and let it go.  Sure, I'm not talking to him either right now - but what do I have to say to him?  I mean really, what do you say to somebody that has ticked you off?  I don't want to get into it with him - I'm not looking for an argument, I'm looking for an apology - something with  meaning.   Whatever - if that means anything to him.  So anyway...who knows...I did make it to the gym today though.  That made me feel somewhat better.  A little, anyways....  HAHA!  Here's a good one: A wife was furious with her husband, saying, "You're an idiot. You have always been an idiot. You'll always be an idiot.    If they had an idiot contest, you'd come in second."  "Why would I come in second?" the husband asked.  She replied, "Because you're an idiot!"

       Well, How am I doing?  Back in the beginning of January I posted my resolutions, let's check in to see how I am doing...  My Resolutions  In the year of 2004 I hereby resolve....  ...to be a more positive and optimistic person. ( This one will be tough, but, I will try...)  This one is turning out to be tough - some of the people out there make this very difficult!  I AM trying.  ...to keep my weight down.   Ah, so far so good...not losing anymore yet though...  ...to flatten my stomach by going to the gym more often. Then, if I get my stomach flat I want to get it pierced. (I just think that is sooo sexy.)  No real progress here yet, I have taken some Ab classes at the gym though, that's a start.  ...to finally finish my kitchen. (Painting the walls, redecorating, etc...)  Absolutely no progress here.  Haven't really even started to think about it.  ...to start painting and drawing again. And to take some art classes.  Nope.  ...spend more time with my kids playing.  That's been good, doing some reading with Alex, playing dolls with Lauren.  ...spend more one on one time with my husband! ;)  Yes!  ...write letters to my family and friends far away.  I've made some phone calls to friends I haven't talked to in awhile...really need to write letters though...maybe I'll just send them a link to my blog and they can keep up with me that way! Hmmm....  ...be more organized!  I'm really and truly trying - little by little... Hmm...any new resolutions?  Well, one thing I've been trying to do is to read more books.  I've joined Bookcrossing (check out the link on the side there) and I've already read several books.

       So, got up this morning - got the kids ready and took them into daycare.  Steve slept in a little bit because he had a dentist appt. this morning.  (Normally we drive together everyday and take the kids in together)  So anyway, I'm dropping them off - Alex leaves without so much as a goodbye and Lauren decides she will throw a fit!  I hate that!  I don't really feel guilty about the fits anymore - cause I know, as soon as I'm gone - they stop - it's only for my benefit that she does this!  I mean literally throwing herself around as the teacher is carrying her away.  LOVE IT.  As soon as she is in the gym, where she can't see me anymore - it's silence.  That quick.  So it's just a hassle for me, don't you love it?  Oh well - she is 3 and quite the Drama queen.  She is such an actor, you wouldn't even believe it.  For the most part though she is a very good kid, just like her brother, but she defintely is more high maintenance than her brother.  I guess it's the difference in boys and girls...Anyway - got an exciting meeting to go to!  Talk to you later!  Meanwhile, check out this site  urlLink Faces of the Fallen , this is a list of US Fatalities in Iraq.  Very nice tribute.

       So, is anyone following this phenomenom of  urlLink American Idol ?  It's such a rage - I hear everyone talking about, I just can't get into though.  I do love the first several episodes where people go on there who think they can sing.  I LOVE IT!  Here's one that has a website now.... urlLink William Hung ...This is priceless.

       WOW!  How about this...Maurice Clarett can  urlLink enter the NFL draft .  Will this be agood thing or a bad thing?  I've read several opinions on this and I think I have to agree, that this is a wrong decision.  The NFL has very clear guidelines and on when they will accept a player and they are not discriminating.   urlLink Whatever happened to good common sense ?  Here's  urlLink one guy  that thinks it won't make a difference to the NFL.  What do you think?

       I am so damn emotional lately, I cry at the drop of a hat!  It's really starting to bother me, it gets so that I can't function during the day.  I mean some of the stuff is understandable - this morning when I heard they had  urlLink found the body  of that 11 year old Florida girl - I just bawled.  UNDERSTANDABLE, that is such a tragedy.  I can't stop thinking of her and her parents.  But there are other things that make me cry - that I just don't get...I mean, I'm getting weird.  I'll cry at commercials, songs, just plain weird things that I shouldn't be crying over.  Why am I like that?

       So....Steve's grandmother has been very sick - long story short: They found cancer, removed cancer, did radiation.   Cancer is gone now, but the radiation just totally FRIED her brain.  Nice.  So she's slipping further and further into Alzheimers.  She's just loosing it.  So everyday now since about Thanksgiving we go over to her house.  We spend nearly all of our free time there.  She enjoys it - and we do too, most of the time.  It has been very difficult sometimes to go there - but you know, you do what you have to do.  So anyway, now her 2 daughters have decided to move her.  I knew this day was coming - but it seems so quick - this Wednesday when Paula leaves to go back to Dallas, she will take Mothers with her.  When I found that out, I just sat down and cried.  It's the best thing for grandmother - I'm just being a bit selfish.  I will miss her.  My kids will miss her.  Anyway, she'll live in Dallas with Paula until Connie, up in Ohio, is all set up and ready and then will move there.  I don't think she quite gets it all - she thinks she's going for a visit, and will come back.  She's worried about the house, but we keep telling her that Steve and I will be here to take care of it.  So anyway...just needed to vent a bit.  OK that's it for now....

       SO, tomorrow I've got my mom, my sister-in-law and my 2 nephews coming for a visit.  I'm so excited.  They will be here tomorrow night around dinner time.  They can't stay long - I think they are leaving Saturday late afternoon or so...Oh well.  At least we get to visit for awhile.  That will be fun.  My house is trashed though...ugh.  Shelly (my sister-in-law) keeps a perfect house - it's always clean!  She's always up doing something in it, cleaning, painting, their house is beautiful!  Well, mine will never be like that!  But, that's OK.  baby steps...at least we can walk through the house.  It's fairly decent.  One of my favorite sayings... "My kitchen floor used to be so clean you could eat a meal off of it - now you can find a whole meal on it."  I love that one!  I found that one off of my brother and Shelly - went on vacation and a lady they met used that line!  How great!  So I've stolen it and made it my own!  I love it.  Of course - my kitchen floor has NEVER been clean enough to eat off of...Oh well, sounds good anyway...

       It was just absolutely gorgeous here!  Saturday and Sunday - just wonderful.  Saturday, I worked out in the front yard, planting more flowers.  Steve worked on his car all day on Saturday - washing and waxing it.  Trying to cover up some of the scratches and dents.  Alex got invited to a movie with a friend, so he went to go see Scooby Doo 2 and then went to the park after that.  That was soo cool.  First time he's been invited on something like that.  He's getting to that age now - I love it.  He wants to have a couple of friends over and have a slumber party - I think we will try to do that in a few weeks.  Should be fun!  So anyway, I planted geraniums (red) all across the front porch and then some cilantro and basil at the corner.  I also bought some more basil, cilantro and mint and planted that out in the "big" garden out front.  Lauren wanted a pink flower so I bought some gerber daisies for her.  Then I slept on the couch for about an hour....nice.  Sunday, Steve went over and started on grandmother's pool early in the morning.  I joined him soon and started working in the yard.  I got the rose bed all weeded and started on the cactus garden.  I hate working in the cactus garden - always get pricked! OUCH!  So anyway, we worked out there for quite a bit, then I took the kids home.  They were having an open house there and I didn't want the kids hanging out.  Steve stayed and finished the pool.  We ordered Outback for dinner - that was nice...mmmmm.  I love Outback.  We were so exhausted last night then, just went to bed and watched TV.  We are sooo exciting!  Anyway, got alot done this weekend and I feel good about it.  I even got a bit of sun on my arms.  Not so Casper looking now.  Still very pale though...Oh well, what can you do?  Hope everyone is having a good day!  Talk to you later!

       So Steve and I went running around at lunch.  I went to the thrift store and he went to the sporting goods store right next to it.  I found a really cute skirt and about 5 ties.  A woman I work with is making purses out of old ties - so I want her to make me one, so I brought her a bunch of ties to do that!  Steve bought himself some Roller Blades and we got Alex a batting helmet.  Apparently Steve thinks he will start roller blading for exercise...sounds like a good plan - in theory!  Oh well.  We shall see.  It is such a beautiful day!  How gorgeous!  I love it.  So anyway, then we went to the mall where I got a Very Berry smoothie.  Life is good again!  I have a smile.  Now back to work because I want to leave early today.  So much to do, so little time!  Hope everyone is happy too!  C'ya.

       So, I am having a  very  good day so far - then out of the blue, somehow I stumble onto a section of the book "Jude the Obscure" online.  Has anyone ever read this book?  It is thouroughly depressing.  Do Not EVER Read this book.  So anyone, there I am - innocently surfing the web...and I run across this horrible section.  Now, I already know what this chapter is about because I have read the book and back in college - when I was fixated on death - this was one of my favorite readings.  I'm not even going to go into it here - because I don't want to bring anyone else down...if you really want to know what it is you can go  urlLink here  - But SERIOUSLY it is DEPRESSING!!  So I really do not suggest it.  Now I am trying my very best to pull myself out of this dark place that I have fallen into.  Anyone have a happy site to visit?   Please?   Isn't that just the saddest thing?  Happy thoughts, happy thoughts...hmm..kittens...no that doesn't work, brown paper packages tied up with string?  That's a good one.  Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens - no, not so much...happy thoughts...  Well, you know what they say - "It's a poor musician who blames his instrument."

       Anyone who really knows me, knows that I hate onions with a passion!  I cannot stress enough - how much I dislike them.  As I was growing up, my mom had to keep the onions, double bagged in a drawer in a dresser that was downstairs in the basement so that I didn't smell them.  I cannot be around when someone is trying to cook with them.  I mean the smell - UGH.  I had a boyfriend once that did not understand how I really felt about onions - I warned him that they made me physically ill, he didn't believe me.  So after eating a burger with big, thick slices of onion on it - he tried to kiss me - I threw up all over him.  He understood after that.  Now I know I am not  urlLink alone.

       So, I've not been having a good couple of days...I just cannot figure out how to shake this.  We (my husband, and my kids and myself) are at the best point of our lives so far - everything is going so good!  Yet I have this overall feeling of blah, sort of a depression, I'm not particularly sad - but I cry a lot.  I feel tired, extremely tired and just cannot focus on all of the little things around me.  I'm falling behind in work - never before...just don't get it.  So I've been on Lexapro for about a month now, but I've also been taking sleeping pills with it.  I'm thinking it's the sleeping pills that are hitting me hard now.  I'm going to stop taking those for awhile and see if I don't improve.  Keep your fingers crossed for me.  Last night, I slept great without a sleeping pill and I feel so much better today.  Yesterday, I was walking around like a zombie!  So anyway...Maybe I am going crazy?  Nah, I've been there already - that's not it.  Oh well...Spring is here, and that always cheers me up.  My flowers are starting to bloom in my yard - pretty tulips already!  I love it.  OK, that's a quick update - talk to you all later!

       Well, we survived our 7 year old's birthday party at the skating rink!  It turned out to be a very nice time.  Alex had a blast and that's what is important.  We had about 12 or 13 kids show up in total.  That was a good turn out.  Of course, Alex ignored the girls and they were all trying to get his attention.  That was hilarious.  He spent most of his time playing video games with the other boys.  Good thing that I spent all of that money for the skating rink! haha.  Next year I know - have his bday party at the video arcade, give each kid $20 bucks and I'll still be ahead!  Anyway, it wasn't so bad yesterday.  I may even do it again....We'll see.  Another day survived.  I came home and slept for about 2 hours after that - I was bushed.  I even skated some while we were there, it's been a long time...but I didn't fall.  My legs are sore today, I am soo out of shape.  Oh well.  Just wanted to let y'all know we had a good time.

       Well, I've hit the big time - I'm posted as a Cliffhanger in another  urlLink blog ...George from Panama.  (I think it's Panama, anyway...)  How funny!  He's holding his breath to find out what happens today with Alex's bday party.  As am I!  I couldn't sleep all @$%(*& night.  I just tossed and turned.  What if 47 kids show up?  (So far 3 have called to say they cannot come)  Worse yet - what if no one shows up?  God How terrifying is this whole birthday party thing?  I don't want to EVER do it again.  Of course, I'm sure I will be doing it all over again for my little 3 year old girl...Will I forget the pain of it all by then?  We'll see.

            It's been very beautiful here lately.  We've been working in the yard alot!  So far this month I have planted 20  urlLink Hyacinth bulbs , 25  urlLink tulip bulbs , 75  urlLink daffodills  and 20  urlLink gladiola bulbs .  I can't wait til they come up!  Yeah!  So exciting.        Then Alex starts baseball practice Thursday night at 5:00.  That's going to be tough getting there by that time, we told the coach, we would make it as early as possible.  He's going to be playing for the  urlLink Phillies .  He's getting excited about it.  Not sure when the first game will be - not far off.        Steve is starting an adult softball team here at work and they will play every Tuesday and Thursday night.  (of course those are the nights that Alex will have ball practice).  Nice how that works out isn't it.      Saturday we are having a birthday party for Alex - he turns 7 on Sunday!  I can't believe my baby is getting so big!  We are having it at the  urlLink Roller Skating Rink .  I sent out 50 invitations!! OUCH!  (The policy at the school and daycare is - if you pass out invites, it has to be to the whole class - so noone feels left out.)  Keep your fingers crossed that that many don't show up!  It's 6.95 a person.  It would be fun to have that many people, but it would put me in the poor house!  Oh well.  That's all that's going on here right now.    Got to run!

       In order to give everyone time to prepare some appropriate April Fools joke for loved ones, coworkers, friends and family - here is a  list put together of the  urlLink top 100 April Fools jokes  of all time.  Please review this early so you're not left behind!  I love this day - although I very rarely have pulled any pranks on any one.  The best one that I have ever done was to use a 100 yd roll of saran wrap and completely wrap up my husbands car in it.  We were dating at the time and working at Chi-Chi's in Canton, OH.  So while he was working, I was out in the parking lot wrapping his car!  Everyone knew about it except for him, so we were all in the windows watching when he went out!  PRICELESS!  That was a good one.  Anyone out there have some good April Fools jokes that they have used?  Let me know....email.

       Things just don't seem to slow down.  So Saturday morning, got up early - set Alex in front of the electronic babysitter, Thank God for Cartoons.  Then Lauren and I did a Sam's Club run.  Those are usually tiring enough for me, but to do it with her was even more so.  I got home just in time to get Alex in his ball uniform and out to the park for baseball tryouts.  We got there and it ended up taking about 2 1/2 hours.  Lauren does not like to sit still for that long, and there was really nothing for her to do.  Meanwhile Steve is home in bed sound asleep.  So we get home after his 5 minute tryout - he was in the last group! AUGH.  Lauren's throwing a kicking and screaming fit, because now all of a sudden, she doesn't want to leave, she wants to stay there.  So I'm dragging, literrally draggin her, through the parking lot to the car.  Just keep on smiling!  Get them home (we live about 3 minutes from the park) and then I give her a couple of good spankings - stung my hand!  Throw her in bed to try to get some sleep.  Alex and I played 3 games of Disney Yahtzee.  That wore me out, then I went out back and weeded the flower beds there, then back inside to the couch with Lauren - she never did take a nap yet.  So we both lay down on the couch and cover all up and then I put on her cartoons and we were both out within 5 minutes.  Very nice.  Just laid around the rest of the day.  Sunday we didn't do too much, I planted some gladiola bulbs in the front, did a Walmart run, prepared the menu for dinners all this week.  Something new I'm trying - preparing a menu for dinners a week at a time, that way I know I will have the food, we won't waste any of it, I can prepare some of it ahead of time...It's a really good theory.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  Anyway, went to bed early Sunday night - but just tossed and turned all night.  I took my happy pill and my sleeping pill, but was still up all night.  Finally about 3:00 am, I popped a couple of xanax and that helped.  Of course now this morning I feel hung over.  Can't win.  I think I will switch to taking my happy pill in the morning, and just the sleeping pill at night.  Maybe it's my Lexapro that is keeping me up.  We'll give it a try anyway.

       So Steve went out tonight with a friend.  They just went to Happy Hour, now here it is almost 3:00am.  He called at about 2 and said he was at the friends house and was just going to spend the night.  I said "absolutely not" take a cab home if you can't drive.  So now I'm up waiting on him cause I'm worried about him.  I hate this feeling.  I really don't mind if he goes out - he doesn't do it that often.  When he said he was going, I just said "I'd rather if you don't stay out all night", he said he was just going for Happy hour and then would be home.  He gets so mad at me if I stay out late.  I hate this.  Anyway, just a quick vent.  Nothing really to be mad at - I'm just worried...

       Steve: One dr. told him it was a  urlLink herniated disk , but we are still not sure.  He is going to see a back specialist now and she is telling him it sounds more like muscle spasms.  We are waiting on the results of the MRI to come back.  Lauren:  She had  urlLink strep throat  and both ears infected.  We are started her on anti-biotic right away, she seems to be getting better, although the way she acted you could hardly tell she was sick in the first place.  Mom:  She was experiencing some chest pains, and heart problems run VERY big in her family.  So they checked her out thoroughly and she was fine.  Not really sure what the problem was there.  They have given her some sleeping pills to start taking, she had taken a sleep test too and apparently she never goes into a deep REM sleep, so she was tired all of the time.  That may have helped cause the chest pains.  Grandmother:  She is living in Dallas now with her daughter Paula.  We miss her very much.  It's hard not seeing her all of the time.  On one hand, what a relief not to "have" to go over there every single day to visit and take care of her, but on the other hand - we don't get to go visit her every day.  We talk to her fairly often and she misses us a lot too.  She doesn't understand why we don't come over for dinner like we used to do.  That's hard.  She seems more and more scattered too, I think the dementia is getting worse.  Alex:  He is great!  He acts like a typical 6 year old, which is crazy, but he's a pretty good kid nonetheless.  He's doing very good in school and getting all A's :).  He is great with his sister and loves to play with her.  His birthday is coming up - March 21st.  He wants to have a party at the skating rink, you should see him skate, he's good!  I can't believe he's going to be 7! WOW.   Me:  So it's going on 3 weeks now that I've been sick.  YECH.  First it was just a regular cold, then it turned into major congestion and a head cold.  Then it moved down into my chest with the lingering cough.  So finally I broke down and went to the Dr. about it.  He said I have bronchitis and gave me some VERY strong cough syrup and an anti-biotic to start.  Well, about 2 days into that I've developed strep throat.  He said this anti-biotic should work on that too, but so far it's just gotten worse, I've been on the anti-biotic for 5 days now, and not much better.  I think I'm going to give it another day or 2 and then go back to him and say FIX ME!  I'm really tired of being sick.  I've got no energy...blah.  Also, right before I got sick, I went to the Dr. about some other things that were going on with me and he said that I have  urlLink depression .  So he put me on an anti-depressant called  urlLink Lexapro .  So there's that fun stuff too.

       So here it is nearly 2 1/2 weeks later...I'm still sick.  I just can't seem to kick this thing.  I finally went to the Dr. on Saturday morning, and he really didn't have anything to tell me.  Gave me an antibiotic prescription and some cough syrup to start on.  The cough syrup though, has hydrocodone in it and that is just kicking my ass!  Way too strong for me.  My husband, on the other hand, loves it.  So he can take it - I'm trying to find some other medicine.  All of the cough drops I'm going through are giving me a terrible stomache ache.  I think I'm going to go home early again today and try to get some rest and kick this a bit more.  We'll see.  I missed Friday at work because Lauren was sick, took her to the Dr. on Friday morning and she had a strep throat and both ears infected.  Poor girl, you wouldn't even know she was sick though, she was bouncing around like crazy!  What a nut!  Anyway...I'm going to get some rest.  I hope all of you feel well.  Bye.

       So I have just been so busy!  And sick on top of it - AUGH!  So it began on Friday the 20th - I woke up feeling horrible, I came into work but only lasted a half day and went home to sleep.  I slept until Sunday morning, yeah I guess I needed some rest!  Isn't that nuts?  I mean, I barely budged those 2 days in bed, boy was that nice.  So anyway, ran around a bit on Sunday (grocery shopping etc...).    Then I needed to get ready to go down to Florida, I left on Tuesday afternoon to fly to Ft. Lauderdale for work.  It was so beautiful down there!  MAN was it nice - sunny and warm.  I stayed at a really nice  urlLink place  too.  It was right across from the beach.  But anyway, I was down there for work, an  urlLink ISO audit  of our Sunrise facility - so I didn't really even get to enjoy the area or weather.  I left there Thursday morning and flew to Cincinnati and then back to Huntsville, I was supposed to go through Atlanta but they got snow and the flights were all getting delayed and cancelled.    So I worked all day on Friday trying to catch up from being gone - I can never catch up!  Then I went home packed up our suitcases and the car just in time for Steve to arrive home with the kids and we got in the car and drove to Cincinnati (I know - I was just there yesterday!)  So, I'm still sick, Lauren is starting to catch the cold and Steve went to the Doctor that morning and was told he had a  urlLink herniated disk  - this is going to be a fun drive!  We were so exhausted, but we made it into my brothers house around 2:00 am local time.    Got up early Saturday morning and getting ready to head up to Canton where we were going to spend the afternoon with my parents.  So we call to tell them we are heading out and find out that they are just heading in to the emergency room with my mom.  She had been having hot/cold flashes all night with chest pains.  SOOO, now I'm really anxious to get up there.  So when we get there we meet up with Dad in the parking lot.  She's fine, she's just being monitored right now and the kids can't go in.  I'll go back later and visit her by myself.  So we go to lunch with Dad - that was really nice - went to The Irish Exchange out on Tusc.  Had lunch and then went over to my in-laws.    Which, this is the whole reason we were even making this crazy trip - they were having a party Saturday night for my Mother-in-law's 50th birthday.  So everyone knew we were coming except for her.  So we show up and surprise her - she was surprised, so that was fun.  OK, so then the party Saturday night - it was out at  urlLink Peter Shear's  and was really nice!  We had so much fun, the kids were good, just a great night.  They are really fun people (my in-laws and their friends).  They are a bunch of crazy people, for sure, it was fun!    Naturally then Sunday morning I'm a bit hung-over, ugh, and still sick, ugh again.  We get up early and round the kids up and head on to my parents house.  Everyone at my in-laws is still sleeping soundly.  Mom is home from the hospital, she got home really late Saturday night.  She's excited to see the kids so she takes over and Steve and I go back to bed.  (Catch a bit of sleep, not nearly enough.)    So we just visit for awhile, then get back into the car and drive back to Cincinnati, I'm getting really tired of this drive.  We get to my brother's and they are just firing up the grill for dinner.  We have steaks and fish and it was all wonderful, everything.  We're waiting on our friend Steve Youels to come over and visit for a bit.  I'm about to fall over I'm so tired and I'm still hacking away from this cold.  Steve doesn't even get there until 9:00, which is way past my bedtime, so I try to hang for awhile, but give up fairly soon and go to bed.    Get up early Monday morning cause the kids are running around like mad animals.  LOVE IT.  Once again, we pack up our stuff and head out on the road to come home.  The drive home was not too bad, we got in fairly early and had a chance to just kick back and rest.  We ordered in Chinese for dinner and did not much else.    So anyway, that pretty much brings me up to today.  I'm still sick...I want to feel better...I know this was a really long read...sorry about that.  And  urlLink Trish  - sorry we didn't even call you while we were in Canton!  I meant to, just ran out of time.  Anyway - I'll keep it shorter now that I'm all caught up...well mostly caught up!

       Last night I was helping my 7 year old son do research on Tiger Sharks.  All he had to do was write 5 measley sentences on Tiger Sharks! AUGH.  So we are out there searching on the web.  Lot's of sites - he can't come up with 5 little sentences... Me:  Why don't you write what they look like? him: No, I already know that. Me:  Well, maybe not everyone knows that... him: Yes, mom, everyone knows that - except for kindergartners - 'cause they don't read. Me: (sigh) Well, why don't you write what they eat. him: No, they just eat people and stuff... Me: (grinding teeth) So write that. him: No, I don't want to write that either... Me: (clenching jaw) You have to write something, what else are you going to write - WRITE SOMETHING NOW! So this just goes on and on...he ended up throwing down 5 quick sentences that I forced him to write because it was getting so late.  This is what you other parents of little ones have to look forward to.  Get used to the idea now.    Besides that though, I did learn some interesting tidbits on Tiger Sharks.  :)

Great for him, he'll be doing an interview with Al Roker and have his own website soon too.  He seems like a funny guy, we'll have to watch for him!

       Running late today - I feel awful!  YECH.  Must be coming down with that stomache bug - but I guess if you want to be technical about it, then a HANGOVER would be the more accurate term.  MAN, did I do some drinking last night.  Ouch.  But I had SOO much fun.  What a blast.  A girl here at work is getting married, so we had a little girls night out!  We really had a great time.  I didn't get in too late either, it was about midnight.  However, I did start drinking at 5:00 - makes for a rough day today.  Oh well, I don't do it that often.  I feel better now, but didn't get into work until around noon.  It was just SO much fun!  We had guys all over buying us drinks - good to know that I've still got it.  :)  So anyway...Steve has a softball game tonight at 6:00, so I need to run and get the kids and we'll go watch him play.  That should be fun.  I guess anyway.  What else is going on?  I don't know, can't really think.  Well, I'll just leave it at that and talk to you more tomorrow.  Got to wake up!  Hope everyone is having a better day than me!  Bye!

       Well, kind of anyway....I'm at home again today with my little brat, I mean darling daughter.  Since I picked her up at noon yesterday, I can't take her back for 24 hours of symptom free.  She was fine all day yesterday... not sure, she just may be trying to fight off that stomache virus.  Just have to watch her.  So I ran into work this morning and grabbed some more of my paperwork and stuff I needed and came back home with her.  Besides, where else can you work in your underwear?  Well besides like a strip club or something..(which I am not qualified for...)  I love to hang out in just my tank top and bikini's!  What a great work atmosphere! :)  Anyway, so I will be working from the luxury of my couch in my undies :) NO PEEKING!  Hope everyone is having as good a day as I am!  I'll chat more later....bye!

       Well, got the call today.  You know, the call that every parent dreads....The call from daycare to tell you that your child is sick and you need to come pick them up.  So Lauren, it seems, has this nasty stomache virus that is going around.  I had to leave work and go pick her up...Oh well, at least I get to hang out at home today...right?  sure whatever...Now I have to wait at least 24 hours until I take her back to daycare as well.  So, I will probably be home tomorrow morning as well.  Kind of good, kind of bad - I'll get behind at work.  Oh well, don't want her at school like this anyway.  Gives me some time to hang with my little princess.  OK, she wants to watch Tarzan, got to go get that started...talk to you later!

       Just a quick hello to everyone - hope you are all good today.  I'm fine here - it's been a VERY busy morning already.  Looks to be an extremely busy day.  Oh well - that's OK - it should fly by fast then.   So anyway...what is going on?    Well, my son is becoming very diplomatic - too cute - Last night, he comes home from school and tells us he was on yellow yesterday.  WHAT?  Why?  He looks at us with these pitiful little eyes and says "I was just so excited about my dad coming home Friday night that I got on yellow today."  How could you be mad at that?  Ha ha!  He is learning so young!  I LOVE IT!  He also had a ballgame last night, they lost 7-6.  Oh well, we'll get 'em next time.  What else?  Not much that I can think of, it's a bit cold out today - and of course I wore a little short skirt...hmmmm, not a smart move, my legs and toes are freezing!   Oh well, it's better to look good than to feel good, right?  right.  OK all, have a great day - I'll try to post more later.

       I won't get in to all of the juicy details - but WOO HOO!  This was a great weekend.  Steve didn't get in until late Friday night -  Man, it was great to see him come down that hall in the airport!   So anyway...it was just an awesome weekend...it almost seemed as though we were going for some kind of record...hee hee!  We did go out Saturday night, went to 801 Franklin - WOW.  Yummy, that place is just always incredible.  We started off with a bottle of the Acacia Pinot Noir and a cheese sampler for an appetizer.  Then I had the spinach salad and trout for dinner.  Steve had the filet.  Everything was mmmmm good.  We also had the wine flight for the night, which was a set of 3 whites.  Those were quite delicious as well.  (And no Groonk - I didn't see Blake bartending...as you predicted, my mind was elsewhere...)  So anyway...got to get busy here at work this morning.  Hope everyone has a great day!  Talk to y'all later!

       I can't wait!  Steve is coming back home tonight!  YEAH!  We will pick him up at the airport tonight at 9:00!  How exciting.  It's been a fun week with the kids, but I'm so glad to have him back.  Not sure how single parents do it!?  I guess you do what you have to do.  Anyway - got a very busy day here at work, and I'm feeling like crap today.  My stomache and head are both spinning.  Hopefully I am not catching that stomache virus that is going around here at work and daycare.  Keep your fingers crossed - cause that would just ruin my welcome home plans for Steve!  OK - got to get working here!  Have a great morning everyone!

       As soon as I picked up my not-so-little girl, I felt it pull right in the middle of my back....Man that hurts.  I should know better, but I guess I don't.  Oh well.  So I was wrestling around, tickling my brats this morning and now I have a shooting pain in my back.  At least we were having fun!  I had both of them going, they are such a riot sometimes.  Not sure what I would do without them...except have some peace and quiet.  But who wants that? :) Not me!  I kid around a lot - but I really and truly love those nerds.  They are really fun to mess with!  Ha ha!  So, tonight is our last night without Steve - he comes back home tomorrow night!  I cannot wait!  I'm getting ready for a HOT date with him Saturday night.  Lining up a sitter and we are going out to 801.  (Check out the link on the side there...)  I love 801 - yum!  Anyway - should be fun.  Can't wait.  OK - hope everyone is having a great day!

       So, it was around 1993.  I was working at Chi-Chi's - Belden Village in Canton Ohio.  This was an awesome place to work at the time!  I was going to school full time at Kent State University, dating Steve, and having a blast!  It was one of those places that everyone got along.  We all hung out together, we worked together, we partied together and a lot of us slept together...but that's another story!  Anyway...So, Tricia started working there - somewhere around '93 anyways...maybe a bit earlier...Well, she was friends with one of the "odd" girls.  So, we really were not sure about her...watch what you say around her - cause we don't know what she is like yet! :)  So, then Steve and I got engaged - that was December of 93.  She had just gotten engaged as well and we were both starting to plan our weddings.  That's when we became fast friends.  We just clicked and hit it off from the start!  There was actually 3 of us - Me, Trish and Susan.  We were very close friends - but somehow - Trish and I were more alike...had more in common...I got married in '95 and at the time of my wedding, they were my best friends.  Even though neither of them were in my wedding.  How odd is that?  Well, when we set the wedding and party and all of that - we really weren't hanging out.  Then we did...but it was too late to change it.  I remember on my wedding day - I was fine, not nervous at all...I walked into the back of the church holding my dad's arm - no prob!  This was a piece of cake - then I turn the corner and the first people I see in the jam-packed church is Susan and Tricia - looking at me, smiling and a little teary eyed...I lost it.  It just hit me so hard...I really had to grip on to my dad to make it up the aisle. So here we are 10+ years later and Tricia and I are still fast friends.  She is surely one of those fair and foul weather friends.  That's a great thing to know.  Susan turned out to be a fair weather friend...but that's OK - a lot of people are like that.  I don't keep in touch with any of my other friends from Ohio - I tried for a long time...but eventually just gave up.  It was always a one way connection - they never tried to keep in touch with me.  Oh well, again, you learn who your friends are.  So, that's how I met Trish!  Just a little bit of history...I don't know if any of you cared - but you know what?  I don't care if you care!  Again, I am only here to amuse myself! Thank you!

       It seems like our lives are running parallel.  Although, I guess that's what happens with good friends sometimes!  We have so many things in common!  It's really freaky sometimes.  So Saturday, I went in to the Dr. and find out that I have  urlLink Vertigo .  Not really sure why though.  I started feeling really dizzy at Alex's ball game Friday night and by Saturday night it was getting much worse.  What a really bizarre feeling.  I had never had it before - but I knew Tricia had been getting it often recently.  So there you go...Sunday I felt slightly better and today - so far - I feel fine.  Keep your fingers crossed!

       I feel like my days are just flying by me and I am not really accomplishing anything.  How bizarre, well I guess that's not really bizarre - just life.  Today is a VERY beautiful day out.  I don't want to be here.  I have been having a very bad case of Spring Fever.  I just don't want to work - I want to be outside playing!  Oh well...Now I have a huge pile of work here on my desk and how will I ever catch up?  I'll be taking it home with me this weekend - great.    So Steve is leaving on Sunday for Vegas.  He's going out there for a tradeshow and will be gone until next Friday.  Just me and the 2 brats! :)  I'm kind of looking forward to a little alone time with the kids.  I'm hoping we can do some fun things.  We'll see.  Alex will have baseball practice and games several nights next week - so that will take up most of the time.  I don't know yet...I will miss Steve though.  I hate when he goes.  It's not that often that he travels, I travel more than him.  (I love to go on trips!)  Well anyway, supposed to be very nice all weekend.  I'm planning on working in the yard some more and lounging around.   Doesn't that sound good?  MMMMmmmm!    OK everyone - going to attack this pile of work and try to get out of here as early as I can!  Hope y'all have a great day!  (I'm really starting to pick up this Alabama accent!)

       So, I am still working away at this one...my goal in losing my weight and trying to flatten my stomache is to be a Milf.  This is a term I heard on the movie American Pie, and I just love it!  I want people to look at me and say - WOW - you have 2 kids - unbelievable!  Yeah, I know, it's very vain.  But, what can I say, that's what I am shooting for.  Apparently I am having some sort of mid-life crisis.  I did just turn 35 - in my family, that's beyond midlife!  So, if anyone has any tips on reaching MILF status, or if they are trying to reach it as well, let me know!  I'd appreciate it!

       So we had a very nice Easter this year.  This is the first Easter in about 7 years that we have actually had an Easter dinner!  Very nice.  I got up very early on Sunday morning and put together the easter baskets for the kids.... Lauren's:  A cute little white basket filled with candy (not much), a plastic tea set, a jump rope, crayons, coloring book, a little stuffed easter bunny,  urlLink silly putty , umm...what else?  I guess that might be it - it was just all a bunch of small goodies from the dollar store (I love that place for things like this!) Alex's: A baseball duffel bag was his basket and it was filled with candy (again not much), a  urlLink spirograph set , a silly pen with hair, colored markers,  urlLink silly putty , a drawing book, construction paper, a water bottle and some hot wheels. Once I got them all put together, I put the baskets on the end of each of their beds - so they wake up to them.  It's so fun hearing them wake up and start going through the stuff!  I love it.  So Alex comes running in to our room, where I'm pretending to be asleep, and yells "Mom, the Easter Bunny was here!!!" - he is so excited!  I love it!  Anyway it was fun.  My parents were down here this weekend as well, so we just kind of hung out all day.  It was rainy and wet - so there was no playing outside...I cooked a leg of lamb, a ham, mashed potatoes, corn, and we also had deviled eggs and a big salad.  It was all so good!  Really yummy.  That was the first time that I've cooked lamb, it turned out wonderful.  I bought all of the stuff to make gyros with the leftovers and made the gyro sauce too.  That's what we will have for dinner tonight.  I can't wait.  MMMM. :)  So Mom and Dad left this morning and headed back home to Ohio.  I hope to get up to see them again soon.  We'll see.    Today is my 35th Bday - wow.  Not much planned, going out to lunch with some girls from work.  That will be nice...I guess that is it.  Steve already got me my bday present (That digital camera).  So that's all.  Boy, as you get older, there is just less and less to look forward to!  haha!  Oh well, just another day.

       So right now, Lauren is sleeping, Alex is drawing with chalk on the front walk and I am sitting outside talking to mom and dad.  They got here late last night and we have just been hanging out visiting.  I think we are going out to dinner tonight for my bday.  (I turn 35 on Monday the 12th).  Not sure where I want to go yet, we'll decide soon.  Steve is over at Mother's house helping his parents with loading up some of that stuff.  They are trying to pack up and head out soon - quick weekend for them.  I wish I could go see them too, but my parents are here - what a busy weekend.  So anyway...tomorrow, we'll have a nice little easter dinner and just kick back again, then my parents are leaving here Monday morning.   It's been a nice day here, we've been working in the yard and cleaning up out front.  Now I want to go buy my new front porch funiture, not sure if we have enough money though....guess I'll wait. So anyway...just wanted to say hi.  I'll holler at y'all later!  Hope everyone is having a good day! Bye!

       So here it is - 4:39 in the morning - aren't normal people sleeping right now?  I suppose so...I just keep laying there thinking about everything that I need to get done both at home and at work...not fun.  So I thought I would just go ahead and get up.  This is ridiculous!  So anyway, today I did go and have lunch with Alex - that was fun.  He loves that, gets to show off his mom to the other kids.  And all of the kids come running around and want to sit next to you too.  It's so cute.  I do like doing that, especially when I see him smile like that.  I need to do it more often.  Anyway - not much else...going to go shower and get ready for work.  Hope everyone has a good day, I'll talk to y'all later!

       Here's one I got today - thought was funny...again, I am only here to amuse myself!  A drunken man walks into a biker bar, sits down at the bar and orders a  drink. Looking around, he sees 3 men sitting at a corner table. He gets up, staggers to the table, leans over, looks the biggest,  meanest, biker in the face and says: I went by your grandma's house today and I saw her in the hallway buck  naked. Man, she is one fine looking woman!" The biker looks at him and doesn't say a word. His buddies are  confused, because he is one bad biker and would fight at the drop of a  hat. The drunk leans on the table again and says: "I got it on with your grandma and she is good, the best I ever had!" The biker's buddies are starting to get really mad but the biker still  says nothing. The drunk leans on the! table one more time and says, "I'll tell you  something else, boy, your grandma liked it!" At this point the biker stands up, takes the drunk by the shoulders  looks him square in the eyes and says,  "Grandpa,....... Go home, you're drunk !"

       Hello all!  Well, I had a good night's sleep last night - the first night in months!  I love it, I feel so much better today! :) Yeah!  Anyway, another busy day at work today and I must get started.  I am going into school to have lunch with Alex today.  He's been asking for weeks and I never have time - not have time for your son - isn't that terrible?  So I will go today - he's so excited, I can't wait!

       In the year of 2004 I hereby resolve....   ...to be a more positive and optimistic person. ( This one will be tough, but, I will try...)        Yeah - well I knew this one was going to be hard...I think I'm better...  ...to keep my weight down.        So far, so good on this one - even have lost a few more pounds.  ...to flatten my stomach by going to the gym more often. Then, if I get my stomach flat I want to get it pierced. (I just think that is sooo sexy.)        Well, I am going to the gym 3-4 times a week and doing lots of abs exercises - I think I see a bit of a difference.  ...to finally finish my kitchen. (Painting the walls, redecorating, etc...)        I bought the primer and tape - left it sit in the garage now...  ...to start painting and drawing again. And to take some art classes.        I looked online, but have not signed up for anything yet.  ...spend more time with my kids playing.        I am playing with them a lot more!  ...spend more one on one time with my husband! ;)        Definitely doing that!  ...write letters to my family and friends far away.        no letters yet...I need to move on that!  ...be more organized!       Yeah - I'm about the same there!  I'll work on it.

       Last night Alex had baseball practice.  We hadn't been there for very long, I had just started reading my book (The portrait of Dorian Gray) when I hear this loud thud...uh oh - I look up and all of the coaches take off running to Alex.  He had turned to catch the ball - but the sun was right in his eyes and he lost it. It nailed him right in his nose - blood was just ouring out of his nose like someone had turned a faucet on.  Oh boy, so they bring him over to the bleachers and sit him down - boy it was hard to get that blood to stop pouring.  It just kept on coming.  I finally got it slowed down and put some ice on his nose - poor kid- he was just bawling the whole time - "this is why I don't want to play baseball!".  So after I get him calmed down and cleaned up some, I just took him home.  He's OK, but he does have a mark under his nose from the stitched on the baseball....poor kid...

       Went out to dinner last night with one of our Sales Reps that is in town.  We went to  urlLink Mikato's restaurant  - yummy!!  Had a really good time.  After that, we went to a little bar, Rugby's, and had a couple of beers and then called it a night.  I was back home by almost 10:00.  It was good for me to get out - don't get to do that all that much!  I really enjoyed it.

       Another monday.  This weekend flew by fast and furious.  My family got in Thursday evening, it was a great visit with them.  I wish I could see them more often.  But anyways, it was fun.  They stayed until Saturday afternoon and took off around 2:30 or 3:00.  Lauren went with my mom - (yeah!).  My mom and dad are coming back down here on Friday the 9th, they'll spend the weekend and bring Lauren back.  It was so quiet here on Sunday without that girl.  I just layed around all afternoon - wonderful.  It was too cold outside to do much of anything anyway.  So I just watched movies.  So this morning, we're running late for work because we overslept...go figure.  I just could not drag myself out of bed this morning!  So, we're getting in a big rush - I tell Steve - "go ahead in, I'll take Alex and then come in."  No sooner had he left, then I realize I cannot find my car keys.  They are nowhere.   I'm tearing everything apart looking for them.  I'm suspecting that they fell out of my purse in his car.  Well, he doesn't have a cell phone, so I have to wait until he gets all of the way into work to find out.  So, after a few calls, he goes out to his car...sure enough - there they are.  Now I need to wait on him to come all the way back home to give me my keys.  What a pain in the ass!  MAN.  Then I need to go get gas right away because my car is way past E.  Run Alex to school, he's so late, I have to go in and sign for him and take him to his class.  So, by the time I get to work it is now 9:45.  Most of the morning gone...Now, I'm trying to catch up again - as always.  So, no workout today - no lunch today - work late.  Actually I have  a dinner tonight.  One of my sales reps is in town from New Hampshire, so a few of us are going out with her.  Should be fun.  Not sure where we are going yet....OK - got to get to work then.  Hope everyone else is having a good day!  Talk to you later...

Your enthusiasm is very high, dear Aries, as is your physical energy, and so you're likely to want to channel a tremendous amount of energy and personal power into whatever goals you want to accomplish. Today you have the courage to focus on matters that others might not even attempt.  Move forward with caution, but go to it!   This is just very interesting to me today - it seems to fit my day perfectly! Hmmmm.... very interesting ...

       OK - don't have much time, but wanted to let everyone know that I finally got back the results from my MRI.  They were negative, they didn't find anything there that would be causing my vertigo.  So, I guess that is good - but that means that I still do not have a reason as to what could be causing this DAMN Vertigo!  So, most likely it is some kind of infection that we are just not seeing.  OK, got to get back to work, just thought you might be interested in knowing...then again, you may not!  I don't care! haha! :)

       OK - here's the plan...  Friday - we leave here right after work and hit the road, head to Cinci and spend the night at my brother's house (about 7 hour drive). Saturday - get up early, drink coffee, visit a bit, head off to Canton (about a 4 hour drive).  Go to the in-laws house, we'll be staying there this visit, that should be fun - they are crazy people!  We always have a good time with them and yummy food!    Our main intention for this visit is to see Grandmother in her nursing home up there in Canton.  So we will be visiting with her several times.  We also need to see my parents at some point - not sure when, not sure when they will be home either.  Dad will just be getting home from a big trip and Mom is down in Cinci watching my nephews while my brother and sister-in-law are galavanting around Europe.  So anyway - maybe on Monday to see them...I think.  I want to see Trish at some point too and have some drinks or coffee with her.    Tuesday - after lunch, head back to Cinci.  Have dinner (go out maybe) with Ken/Shell and Steve Youels, then the kids and I will head back to Ken/Shell's and Steve will go out with Steve - or maybe Steve Y. will come over and hang out - whatever.   Wednesday - get up early, drink coffee, head back home!  That's all I have of it so far...just don't know exactly what all of the details will be.  But yes - Trish!  I want to see you - we must get together up there!  We are going to try to spend some time with everyone.  We'll see...

       So - I am trying hard to get back in the routine of going to the gym everyday at lunch time.  What do I do today...forget my clothes at home.  NICE.  How can I work out with out my gym clothes?  I'm considering running to the store to buy new ones - but I really don't have enough money to go buy a whole new set of clothes.  Oh well - I will take the kids for a bike ride tonight - that will work.  I want to lose 5 lbs before we head up to Ohio this weekend.  I'm watching my food and getting exercise everyday - I certainly think I can drop that.  Mostly just water anyway!  I'll let you know...I did already drop 1.5 lbs from yesterday, that's a great start!

       OK - checking out  urlLink Groonk  this morning and reading about his success this weekend at the Tavern.  Congrats to you!  But I was thinking about back in the day, and somewhat even now, of all of the cheesy pickup lines I used to hear.  And which of them ever worked...What are some of the lines you remember?  Who's got the cheesiest?  One of the best ones that I can think of was - a guy I used to work with, he would go up to a girl and say "You know that sweater would look great balled up at the end of my bed."  Somehow, it must have worked for him - because there usually was a sweater balled up at the end of his bed...?  Sometimes I just don't get it!  Anyway - leave a comment on your cheesiest pick up line!

       Alrighty then, just a quick update to tell you that I do not yet know the results of my MRI.  I went in Friday and had it done, believe it or not, it was not a lot of fun.  Crazy, huh?  So I lay down on this flat 'bed' and they pack my head in with these stiff pillows so that I will not move around.  Then they drop a 'cage' over my head...hmmm...wasn't expecting that.  So, I slowly start moving into the tube and my thought is "well, this is just like going into a coffin" - not a good thought, I can see why some people get anxious in these things - "yes, it's very tight in here" - hmm...having a hard time breathing, is this thing closing in on me..???  OK - focus on breathing just relax...listen to the LOUD noised...OK, calming down.  After the initial bit, it was fine - almost got to the point where I could go to sleep, if they hadn't of given me that ice cold shot half way through - brrr.  Anyway, I'm going to wait til after lunch and give the dr's office a call if I hadn't heard from them by then.  Which I'm sure I won't.  You know how dr's work.  On one hand I want the Dr. to say - "yes - we see what is causing your vertigo" so I will know what it is and we can treat it.  On the other hand, I don't want them to see anything in that MRI...make sense?  I'm sure you understand.  Well, we just have to wait and see in any case.  So, just wanted to give you an update, there you go!

       Blogspot rules!  I'm now able to post photos on my blog!  Woo Hoo!  I am so excited...the possibilities are endless!  Anyway, my first test worked...on to bigger and better things (well, not that you could get better than those darlings!)

       Well, I now have a 2nd grader at home!  I can't believe it!  Alex is 7 already - how time flies! WOW.  Anyway, yesterday was his last day of school.  He ended up with all A's!  I know, some of you are saying - well - sure, it's only 1st grade, he better have all A's.  But that is not always the case - it's not like his whole class finished that well.  So - I am  extremely  proud of him!  As a special reward for him doing so well - we stopped off and bought him an  urlLink aquarium  and a couple of little fish.  We got 6  urlLink neon tetra's , 1 male  urlLink guppy , 2 female  urlLink guppies , an  urlLink algae eater  and a  urlLink shrimp .  The shrimp got in the bag by accident, so that one will be Lauren's.  She has named it Rex.  Nice, huh?  Oh well.  Anyway...so we get up this morning and one of the little tetra's is dead already...  Me:  Well, Alex - we lost one of your tetra's already honey. Alex:  How did we lose him - didn't we put them all in the tank? Me:  Yes, but one of them died overnight. Alex:  Where is he? Me:  He is in the plant, mommy will have to pull him out of the tank this morning.  So, a few minutes go by, we are all getting dressed, and I walk by his room to see him sitting on the edge of the bed, near tears.  Me: What's wrong honey? ALex: I know why the fish died...you told me not to put my finger in the water and while you weren't looking last night, I did... Me: *hug* Oh honey - that didn't kill the fish!  You should never put your finger in the water - but still that wouldn't kill the fish! Alex: Are you sure that I didn't kill the fish - I went and looked at him and his face is all white.  Anyway - how pitiful is that?  I went on to do my best by explaining that the fish was probably either already sick or just didn't like the new water...I think he was OK with it all by the end!  I think...of course I still had to pull that fish out of the water...ick.  Oh well! Got to run!  Have a great day everyone!

       I learned yesterday, that you could light  urlLink C-4  on fire and it would not blow up.  You can use it to cook with off in the jungles of Thailand (say for instance a monkey that you just shot), just don't stomp that fire out - that would be the last time you did that!  Apparently what causes it to actually blow up is the shock.  So it needs both fire and shock to explode.  I did not realize this!  See you really do learn something new each day!  I hope I could share a small bit of this wisdom with all of you!

       What do you mean Tricia?  How bad can a MRI be?  I think I may have had one done a long time ago...but don't really remember - that may have been a CAT scan.  Anyway, I figure the worst part will be getting the IV done.  I HATE needles - terrified of shots!  An irrational fear, but a big fear nonetheless!  So now, you have me wondering...How bad will it be?  Well, one thing is certain - I will find out tomorrow!  I am rather anxious to have it done because I really want to see what is causing this vertigo and I hope they find in explanation in doing this MRI.  He feels that it could be one of several things...a deep down sinus infection that is just not seen by looking in my ears, or nose, or eyes...a growth on the inner ear canal (he called it something, but I don't remember what)...a tumor (he said, very small chance...nervous haha).  I did ask him about the vertabrae, trish, he said he didn't think that would really cause Vertigo.  Not to offend you or what you are doing - but he said "That probably came from a Chiropractor - and that is just really not medically founded - he's probably got her on some kind of herb or mineral too."  SOOO...not sure, but that's what he said.  Obviously though, your treatments seem to be working for you.  Well OK then, that's what is up there.  I'm back to our ISO Audit all day today, so I will be out of pocket.  Hope everyone has a great day and I will write to you more later.

       OK - in the famous words of AC/DC - I'm back!  The vertigo came and hit me hard again on Sunday morning, and really hasn't gone away since.  I went to the Dr. about it again last night, still not real sure what is causing it.  So he is scheduling me to have a  urlLink MRI  done.  After that, we'll see!  I'll keep you updated!

       Well, I just found out that  urlLink Ocean's Twelve  (the sequel to  urlLink Ocean's Eleven ) will be coming out on December 10th!  Thanks to  urlLink The MovieBlog .   urlLink Jen  - you need to check that site out - between the 2 of you, I get great movie info!  I love your movie critiques - don't always agree - but still like them!!  Anyway, I  really  liked Ocean's Eleven - I don't know how many times I have watched it - but the combination between, the actors, the "hip" music, and the storyline - I am just mesmerized when I happen to catch it, and cannot turn away.  So now it is back and with  all  of the original actors - how awesome is that?  PRETTY DAMN AWESOME - I say!  So, OK, just though that I would share that useful bit of info with everyone!  And thank you Groonk, for leading me to  urlLink The MovieBlog !

Mr. Owl grabs the Tootsie Pop from the boy's hand. Mr. Owl: One ... *lick* Two ... *lick* Three! *bite* Pan to disappointed boy as Mr. Owl hands back the now vacated stick. Mr. Owl: (declaratively) Three.    urlLink Now we can find out the truth...

       So far I have written and sent off 2 letters to  MY  soldier.  It's kind of exciting, I am not sure how long it takes for these letters to get over to wherever he is.  I hope he will like receiving them and will write me back.  We shall see...I want to get together a small care package today or tomorrow to send over.  I've been checking out several sites and will link them here - if any of you want to "adopt" a soldier or just send a few letters or maybe a care package...check out the following...   urlLink Operation Gratitude   urlLink Any Soldier.com   urlLink Operation Uplink   urlLink Books for Soldiers   urlLink Angels 'n Camouflage   Anyway, there are many more out there - these are just a few that I have found and thought were interesting!

       I feel as if I am drowning in paperwork! AUGH.  My desk certainly has lost the battle already, and I may not be far behind.  I have a workshop this morning for training and also another audit this afternoon.  How will I catch up on the paperwork if I'm doing other stuff all day!?  It just don't add up!  Oh well - tomorrow, I will just barricade myself in my office, close the door and not come out until I'm done!!  That's all there is to it.  I hate having to do this, but that's what it had come down to!  Just grin and bear it now.  I think I need to plan on one day this week to clean my office as well - I just keep bringing more and more "stuff" in here and it's getting to look really trashy.  I just need to take one afternoon and go through all of this junk and get it out of here.  That's it!  I'll do it on Friday - even going through my files and cleaning those out.  ORGANIZATION!  If anyone has any tips on how to better organize an office - I'm all ears!  PLEASE HELP!  OK - that's it for now, got to run to my workshop (more training).  I'll talk to you all later!  Take care!

       I've got a hectic schedule today - hope I'll be able to fit it all in!  We'll see.  Work is piling up on my desk, and I have an internal  urlLink ISO Audit  today as well.  I am one of our few Head Auditors here, so I will be running the audit this afternoon.  I enjoy doing it though, it's been a really great experience for me and has brought me many new oppurtunities.  So - I'll try and write more later...but if you don't hear from me - that's where I'm at!   Have a great day everyone!

       So, yesterday - I went to  urlLink angels 'n camouflage  and signed up to adopt a soldier.  I am really excited about it.  This morning when I came in, there is my new soldier!  So I've just written off a little card of introduction and will mail that out today.  Isn't that fun?  I suggest that everyone check this out!    Anyway, as I wrote  urlLink yesterday , I want to start up a little letter writing campaign of our own!  If anyone wants to send a letter - what you can do is email the letter to me and  I will print it out and mail it for us.  There are still lots of deployed soldiers not getting any mail!  I figure this is just a little something that just might make them feel a bit better.  I will also be putting together some care packages to send off as well, maybe you might want to put together one of your own and mail that out!  Just let me know and I will get you the info you need - addresses, and what you are allowed to send.  It's a win, win situation!

       Make sure you check this out -  urlLink Books for Soldiers , and this one too -  urlLink Adopt a soldier .  OK - So I'm thinking, that we need to start a letter writing and care package campaign to our soldiers that are on active duty all over the world.  Anyone interested?  Well I am!  If anyone wants to donate towards this - be it letters, care packages, books, movies, whatever - I will send them off!  If you want more info on this please post a comment or send me an email!  I will get back in touch with you and let you know how you can help!  They can use so much over there - wouldn't this be great?

       So much is going on right now around our country and around our world...it's hard sometimes to just get through the day.  I normally don't go on about politics and world affairs - I guess I try to leave that to the "brillant" minds out there.  I try to add a bit of my life, a bit of lightness to the world...when I can anyway.  Sometimes it does get difficult.  I guess, I struggle within myself on how I feel about some of these "heavier" issues and the reality of it is - We NEVER know the whole story.  The war in Iraq, the prisoner abuse scandal, the beheading of an American...I mean - we only are getting half the story, and that's all we will get.  The Kobe Bryant rape case, the Scott Peterson trial...we only know part of the story!  I try to be an optimist - maybe I'm just naive.  I don't know.  Anyway - not sure that I really have a point at all to the post, sorry about my rambling.  I just get depressed sometimes about the situation of the world...especially since I have become a mom - I just want the best for my kids - of course.  But then, I look at what my kids see - and I think that right now, they think the world is a pretty good place.  From their point of view - Life is great!  That makes me feel good, that means that I am doing my job right for now anyway!  Well - ok all - have a good day - I'll post more later!

       So, GFD posted  urlLink this  today...I never really considered that before, but now - when I say I have a quest to be a MILF - all that I can conjure up is an image of a very young man, boy...wanting me.  No - that will absolutely not work.  I guess I have just really been focusing on  my  aspect of the MILF - how I want to look, not who was doing the looking...Now...it just doesn't hold the same connotation to me.  So...that said - I need a new term...Does anyone have one that I can steal and use, and call my own? :)  Let me know...

       Another relaxing evening at home last night.  Sat down with a glass of wine and watched Alex splash around in the pool.  Very nice.  Calming, relaxing, enjoyable.  So now on to today.  I've got a lot to do today, and not much time to do it in.  I'm leaving a little early this afternoon, I've signed up to donate my platelets at  urlLink LifeSouth .  This will be something new.  I give blood often, but this will be the first time to  urlLink donate platelets .  Apparently it's a longer process, but they take less "product" from you.  So, we shall see!  I like to donate blood, it makes me feel good - makes me feel like I am making a difference somewhere.  We all need to do what we can, don't we?  Not to mention that I am Freaking terrified of needles and shots! haha!  Isn't that funny?  I mean, if I see them putting the needle in my arm, I will just flat-out faint!  As long as I don't look - I'm fine.  So that's what I'm up to... how about you?

       What an awesome weekend!  I really had such a great time.  It all started off on Friday...  I went and got a manicure, and a full set of nails put on.  Then Friday night Steve and I sat around talking mushy, drinking wine and eating strawberries!  What a great night.  :) wink, wink! Saturday, I got one of those new  urlLink Mystic Tans , where they spray it on.  It looks great - I have a tan for the first time in my life!  Woo Hoo! Sunday, I woke up with an incredible craving for a  urlLink Waffle House  Pecan Waffle...mmmmm yummy!  So I woke Steve up and made him take me there for my Mother's Day breakfast.  We came home then and worked in the yard, he mowed while I planted and weeded.  I love to work with my plants now - so relaxing!  We bought a small  urlLink pool  for the kids and I just sat back and watched them play all afternoon in it!  What a great, fantastic weekend!    Hope all of the other Mom's had a great day as well!  It is the most important job out there!  God cannot be everywhere, so he made mothers. -Arab Proverb

       Got this in an email today and thought it was funny!...Thanks Mom!  MARK YOUR CALENDARS FOR NEXT SATURDAY!  AS YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW,  IT IS A SIN FOR A TALIBAN MALE TO SEE ANY  WOMAN OTHER THAN HIS WIFE NAKED, AND THAT HE MUST COMMIT SUICIDE IF HE DOES.  SO THIS SATURDAY, AT 4 P.M. EASTERN TIME, ALL AMERICAN WOMEN ARE  ASKED TO WALK OUT OF THEIR HOUSE COMPLETELY NAKED TO HELP WEED  OUT ANY NEIGHBORHOOD TERRORISTS!  CIRCLING YOUR BLOCK FOR ONE HOUR IS RECOMMENDED  FOR THIS ANTI-TERRORIST EFFORT.   TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR ALL AMERICAN WOMEN, ALL MEN ARE TO POSITION THEMSELVES  IN LAWN CHAIRS IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSES TO PROVE THEY ARE NOT TALIBAN,  AND TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY THINK ITS OKAY TO SEE NUDE WOMEN OTHER THAN THEIR WIFE.  AND SINCE THE TALIBAN ALSO DOES NOT APPROVE OF ALCOHOL, A COLD  6-PACK AT YOUR SIDE IS FURTHER PROOF OF YOUR ANTI-TALIBAN SENTIMENT.  THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT APPRECIATES YOUR EFFORTS TO ROOT OUT  TERRORISTS AND APPLAUDS YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS ANTI-TERRORIST ACTIVITY.    GOD BLESS AMERICA ! !  IT IS YOUR PATRIOTIC DUTY TO PASS THIS ON ! !

       Hello all!  How are you doing today?  Good - me too.  So, I'm down 3 lbs.  :) WOO HOO!  10 more to go.  Keeping on track now.  FOCUSED.  I am going to call this morning about getting that  urlLink Mystic tan  done...have you heard about that?  Check it out.  I think it's pretty expensive - but I'll see.  I also want to get my nails done either today or tomorrow - kind of a mothers day treat for myself.  We'll see.  Anyway...hope everyone is having a good day - I'll chat more later.

       So, the Powerball is up to $205,000,000.00...what would you do if you won this money? My list.... * quit my job - yes, definitely!  I mean come on! * get a private tutor/nanny for the kids... * tour the world, my husband and me with our kids - I don't want to be separated from them, just want the tutor/nanny to help. * give large sums of money to family - both of our parents, all of our brothers... * buy Steve the REALLY big boat he is daydreaming about, with a "live-on" crew, ready to set out on a cruise! * buy a really nice house - but not exactly sure where... * pay off all of my debt. * put college money away for both kids...  Well, this would certainly give us a good start....and it would not necessarily be in that order...  What would you do with that money?

       OK...so I'm walking around here at work, dropping off some paperwork and whatnot...still in an awesome mood...I stop to talk to another girl for a bit in the hall and she says "Are you pregnant?"...... Me (sob) no, I just gained some weight at my party this weekend - too much beer and junk food...(Big Sigh...) Her "oh" WTF is that about?  God - how much more depressing can it get?  I did gain about 6 lbs in this past week.  Not Good.  OK got to get back to the gym and  urlLink watching my weight .  I've been watching what I eat this week, but still haven't been back in to the gym due to my vertigo.   NICE.  Well, just thought I would share that with you.  My ongoing weight struggle continues!  When will it cease?  When will I be a  urlLink MILF ?  This is a major part of my depression - why does ones weight carry such a large burden? :(  Do I need to take an extra  urlLink happy pill  today?  Do I need to just sit in a corner and sob...what to do - what to do...I guess the better answer would be to have a healthy salad for lunch and get some exercise today!  That sounds about right...I guess...OK, till later...hope everyone else is having a better day...

       Today is such an awesome day!  I feel good, I look good (my humble opinion...), it's just a beautiful day!  My vertigo is getting much better now - Thank God.  That was driving me nuts.  I didn't have any of it yesterday, and so far none today.  :)  What a nice day.  And here I am, chained to my desk with all of this paperwork...ugh.  That's OK - I feel so good, I will just rip through all of this paperwork this morning and maybe I can get out of here a bit early this afternoon.  That's a plan.  We'll see.  I think I may try to have a nooner with my hubby too - that is one of the perks about working with him!  And to all of my family, that really didn't want to hear about that - Sorry!  But isn't it good to know that your daughter, sister, neice, cousin does have a really EXCELLENT sex life?  That is important! haha!  :) wink, wink!  I know, I'm incorrigible - but you know me, I've always been that way!  That's how I landed me that husband in the first place!  Anyway - hope everyone else is having as good a day as I am!  Talk to y'all later!

       My brother Ken sent this to me today!  I love it - Thanks!  As you probably know, they've released John Hinckley from the mental facility and allow unsupervised visits to his parents' home on weekends. You will recall that, John Hinckley shot President Ronald Reagan to impress the actress Jodie Foster. This is such a nice letter from the President:  THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON D.C.  Mr. John Hinckley St. Elizabeth's Hospital Washington, DC     Dear John:       Laura and I hope that you are continuing your excellent progress in recovery from your mental problems. We were pleased to hear that you are now able to have unsupervised visits with your parents. The staff at the hospital reports that you are doing fine.  I have decided to seek a second term in office as your president and I would appreciate your support and the support of your fine parents.  I would hope that if there is anything that you need at the hospital, you would let us know.  By the way, are you aware that John Kerry is screwing Jodie Foster?   Sincerely,   George W. Bush   President

I left work early yesterday due to taking one of my XANAX here at work.  Now everyone I work with probably thinks I am some sort of druggie.  NICE.  I was really stumbling around, hitting the walls, fell asleep at my desk.  It sure comes across as professional - I know that.  God - what an idiot!  Oh well, Shit happens.  OK - that's it - get to work everyone.  I'll talk to you later!

       I made a quick mention of our party the other night - but didn't really get into it...so just thought I would write a quick blurb about it.  I hope to be posting some pics from the party in my photo album soon - we had a blast!  We had about 20-30 people show up and hang out and drink beer.  It was a lot of fun!  (Just a little side note:  Boy, do I work with some cute guys!!  And they are fun too!  Woo Hoo!)  Not as cute as my hubby of course (That's for Steve if he is reading this...which he normally doesn't...)!  Anyway...nothing really bizarre happened - it was just a great night of hanging out with some cool people and drinking.  Brandon brought his guitar and played music for us, we played some poker (I was the only woman playing and I ended up even..), we just ate and drank.  That was a perfect night for me....got to get to know some of these people better - I liked that.  Will definitely do it again.

       Just to let you know too, I've decided to remove the mouse effects - at least for a while - I just can't look at my website right now with the Vertigo - Boy that mouse effect, really kicks the vertigo in to gear and makes me DIZZY!  So, for now, it's gone.  Not sure if I will bring it back or not yet.

       So I went in to the Dr. today....still no reason as to why I have  urlLink Vertigo .  He believes I have some Viral infection that is causing it.  So he gave me new meds to try and see if they work.  So I will give them a try, we'll see...keep your fingers crossed.  He also said that I need to be very inactive - moving around alot will aggravate it.  How do I do that with a full time job, a husband and 2 kids?  Hmm...that would be a good trick.  So anyway, one of the meds he gave me is  urlLink Xanax , which is a tranquilizer - he said this will help to "force" me to slow down.  Interesting...we'll see....of course, now I may be a zombie here at work.  I guess it's better than banging and bumping into all of the walls...Hmmm.  Oh well, I will keep you updated!

       OK...so ended up throwing a little 2 keg party on Saturday night!  HOW FUN!  We had a blast.  Got a keg of Sam Adams and a keg of Bud Light - still have some left, so if anyone is in the neighborhood - just stop by and have a beer with us! :)  Anyway, it was fun that night, we had a good time....what else...  Well, had my vertigo all weekend again, and now I'm getting it again this morning.  Not sure what is causing it and I don't like it.  Not one little bit.  Everything is just spinning and spinning, feels terrible.  It seems to be getting a bit worse, the meds aren't really helping and I kind of feel more like I'm losing my balance now too.  Isn't that fun?  I probably need to go to the doc about it...but who's got the time and the money.  I KNOW, I know, that's just being stupid.  I need to go and get checked out.  Alright then, I will.    Alex has a ball game tonight, not sure on the time...5:30 I think...that's just so early.  We're going to be late to this one.  Normally I leave early on his game days to get him there a bit early, but I didn't get in this morning until 9:00, so I can't leave early.  And, if I go to the doc, that will be more time out.  I've got way too much going on!  I need to be better organized. AUGH.  It's my own fault I know.  I'm working on it.

Then I discovered...Hey - I'm not getting me work done, due to all of this!  That's not good!  How crazy?  So, I'm trying to back off a bit and just get my work done and stay current here.  Hope you can all hang with me for a bit!  Thanks....

       Woo Hooo!  OK, 4 days and counting...for what you ask?  Well, Friday night we are flying (the whole family) up to Ohio, spending the weekend and then Monday just hubby and I are leaving!  That's right, we're going to leave those 2 kids up in Ohio for 2 WHOLE WEEKS!  They won't be coming back until the 19th!  They'll spend a week with Steve's parents and then a week with my parents!  Yeah!  How exciting, whatever will we do without any children around?  I'm betting that you can guess what I will do! haha!  I just really cannot wait!  I will miss them some, don't get me wrong - but this is just a win-win-win situation!  It's great for hubby and me to have some well deserved time alone, it's great for the kids to be away from us and seeing all of their grandparents and it's great for all of our parents to spend time with the long distance grand children!  So, lots to do in between...got to get the house cleaned and the kids packed!  I hate leaving with a dirty house, nothing worse than coming home to a mess!  Oh - I'm just so excited!  And, it will be Lauren's first time on a plane, and really Alex's first time that he will remember!  OK - got to run, get some work done...just wanted to fill you in!

Isn't that fun?  Just something we like to do every now and then, and it is now and then! haha!  So we have all of this free ice cream in the break room right now - mmmmmm....fudge bars, popsicles, ice cream bars, Klondike bars, drumsticks, sherbert, yummy!  This can be such a fun place to work sometimes - all due to people like me - lol!  Yeah - I know, but that's how I am.  Get over it!

       "There's nothing in there!" haha! No - he believes that what I'm experiencing is due to allergies and it's not something that can really be easily treated.  He says that it will most likely go away when the pollen count goes down.  The best way to treat it is with Xanax, 2-3 times a day.   We'll see if I can function on that! haha!  He also did some blood work, so we'll see if anything comes of that either.  I have noticed that the past few days, when it's been raining heavily here, my vertigo has been almost non-existent.  So the allergy thing does make some sense.  Anyway...we'll watch it and see.  Just wanted to update y'all!

       I keep blowing you all off!  Well, it's just that I'm VERY busy lately!  I've got this whole vertigo thing going on, so I am falling behind in...well, everything!  I'm getting a bit of grief here at work and I'm not liking that at all!  NOT a good thing, it's just that I've never had problems keeping up before so I'm not used to getting these "what's going on" talks, and the "do we need to get you some more help" talks.  I DON'T LIKE IT.  So, I'm trying to work my butt off to keep up and to get ahead.  The other part of that whole thing is that YES - I DO NEED HELP! AUGH.  They keep giving me more and more responsibilities and I keep saying, "sure - I can do that, no problem!"  Yeah - sure, I need to say no sometimes, but that is just not me.  OK - so the key is to get better organized, that's a start anyway.  Won't help with the whole vertigo thing...but maybe with the rest of it.  Again - AUGH!  OK, got to run, leaving early today for the neuro - so there is more time that I'll be missing....fun, fun, fun!

       Something I ran across and I really like...   - Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.  - Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills   will be as important as any other. - Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want.  - When you say, "I love you," mean it.  - When you say, "I'm sorry," look the person in the eye.  - Be engaged at least six months before you get married.  - Believe in love at first sight.  - Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't have much.  - Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only  way to live life completely.  - In disagreements, fight fairly. No name calling.  - Don't judge people by their relatives.  - Talk slowly but think quickly.  - When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile and ask, "Why do you want to know?"  - Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.  - Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze.  - When you lose, don't lose the lesson. - Remember the three R's: Respect for self; Respect for others;  and responsibility for all your actions.  - Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.  - When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.  - Smile when picking up the phone. The caller will hear it in your  voice.  - Spend some time alone.

       Well I did the test yesterday - not a lot of fun, but it wasn't as bad as I was expecting either.  So now I am just waiting on the results of the exam - I should hear something this morning - I hope.  My feeling is, I'll get a big fat negative  AGAIN  and still not know what the hell is going on with this vertigo.  But, I guess I should be more optimistic.  I am having a very hard time with this stuff.  I am getting very stressed out over it, and even more frustrated.  I'm trying not to let it get me down, because after all - it could be so much worse.  There are people out there having to deal with so many things that are so much more difficult.  Still...I don't know, it's just not the easiest thing to deal with.  But, life goes on.  I guess.  OK - sorry about being such a downer this morning... Life's a bitch though ain't it?

Apparently this one is not so good - they make you dizzy on purpose...OH FUN!  Anyway, we shall see how it goes.  I'll keep you updated as I hear.  Meanwhile, still waiting to hear back from my GP about seeing a neurologist as well.  Got to get that set up and started.  DAMN VERTIGO.  I can't believe that when I was younger - I used to take drugs to feel like this on purpose????  NUTS....maybe if I started that again, it would have the reverse effect and...ah, nevermind - too old for that crap now!  Oh well...

       I go in to the ENT today at 10:00 to run a test to see if this vertigo could possibly be something called  urlLink Meniere's Disease ...the Dr. feels that it is really nothing inner-ear related, but we will check this stuff anyway just to rule it out.  Depending on the results of today's test I go in on Friday for another test.  So, we shall see - just wanted to keep you all updated.  Hope everyone is having a great day.

       What a weekend - didn't really get much done at all...I had my vertigo again - BAD.  All weekend, I was so dizzy - OK dizzier than normal.  I really hate that feeling, I wish they could figure out what is going on with me - I'm not liking this at all.  Then I also had a HUGE anxiety attack on top of it all.  Nice, huh?  I just can't take the noise - the kids, the hubby, the tv, the dishwasher, the washing machine, the air conditioning running - all of it just seemed to be BLARING in my head and I just couldn't take it - so I BLEW up - just literally blew up on hubby and was ready to walk out the door.  Of course, he didn't let me - which was a good thing - I shouldn't have been driving of course.  Oh well...after a bit it passed and I was fine the rest of the day.  I'm just mental is most of it...maybe not clinically insane, but on my way!  OK - I'm just joking about the mental part, why did you have to agree so quickly? MAN.

       So hello again...seems like it has been forever.  Here it is - late Thursday night...well late for me, normally I am sound asleep by now heavy with the Zzzz's...but alex had a baseball game tonight and I had to give both of the brats - I mean little darlings -  baths when I got home....soo, Lauren is tucked away now and I am waiting on Alex to get out.  Steve had a softball game so he is still out there playing...this is a good thing, it means that they won their first game at 7:00 and they played again at 9:00 - so we shall see.  Anyway - that's my night...I've been surfing around a bit on the web, checking out some blogs and catching up on what all of you have been up to.  There sure are some interesting blogs out there - and it's funny on just how different we all are...everyone has such a different perspective on things.  Oh well - that's what makes the world go round, right? right!  Hope y'all are having a great night, just wanted to say a quick hello.  I'll write more later...see if I can find any interesting sites to link to.  Bye!

       We are leaving tomorrow to go camping and I'm not ready at all!  I've got to go grocery shopping today, wash some clothes for us, and just get everything organized and together.  Lots to do tonight - not enough time.  Shouldn't be too bad - I mean afterall - we are only going for like 2 days...won't need much.  As long as we have plenty of food and beer - all will be well!

       Hello all!  How are you today?  Good here...just busy as a little bee this morning...and you know how busy those bees get?  Shwew!  So...I was online this morning looking for another SNL skit.  My brother Kev had requested the Will Ferrell - Neil Diamond skit and I can't find it anywhere!  DAMN.  I found the transcript  urlLink here... but no luck on actually finding the video of it.  If anyone knows, PLEASE shoot me a link - pretty please, with sugar and a cherry on top?  It looks hilarious.  I don't think that I have seen that one...Funny stuff!

       We had so much fun this weekend and I just haven't had a moment to post about it!  So...finally....ok, well start in the beginning I suppose...  So Friday night we went to some friends house - up on Green Mountain.  They are actually friends of my mother-in-law's, she went to high school with them, but we have met them several times and have hit it off, so we decided to get together.  They are really fun people and have an awesome house.  The kids had fun too, it was a nice night.  Saturday, we just stayed around the house for a bit then went shopping.  Steve bought himself a new  urlLink little toy .  He's so fascinated with this...can't stop playing with it!  We also bought more "stuff" for camping too.  Sunday we went up to  urlLink Madison County Nature Trail  on Green Mountain, that was so much fun!  We've lived here for 8 years and never even knew it was up there!  Anyway, we went  urlLink Letterboxing , that was fun!  The kids loved it, it was like finding a buried treasure.  And now that we have the GPS device too, we are going to start  urlLink geocaching .  This will be a great family thing for us to do on the weekends.  Aren't we cool?  I know....  Anyway, we did have fun...can't wait to go camping this weekend now.  Really looking forward to it.  OK, all...have a great evening!  Talk to you later.

       Woo Hoo!  It's friday and I am doing the TGIF naked feather dance here in my office to celebrate!  It's a bit tricky, and the feathers really tickle - but it is called for!  I am so looking forward to this weekend.  Why, you ask?  Well - just because I do not have to work for 2 WHOLE days!  Now, I like my job and all - but I LOVE the weekends!  Saturday morning is so awesome.  I love sleeping in and then getting up and sipping on some coffee while watching HGTV.  What a great way to start they day...so much that I want to do this weekend...both work around the house and playing with the kids, but not sure yet what we will do.  We will just kick back and play it by ear I guess.  Hope everyone else is having a great morning so far - Come on everyone - The Naked Feather dance must go on!

       Hope that I could shed a bit of light for you Trish...here you go.  urlLink Trish  writes: Really? Good! I really need the answers to the following: - Do the actors on Unsolved Mysteries ever get arrested because they look just like the criminal they are playing?  Yeah - well, not really - in fact quite often the actors have absolutely no resemblance at all to the real criminal, most likely this is to keep this from happening in the first place.   - What if you were to ask a genie to grant you more than three wishes for one of you wishes?   That calls for immediate disqualification and the genie will then revoke  all  wishes.  This is a good, but hard way to learn not to be greedy.   - Why is it that when adults have multiple personalities it's schizophrenia, but when a child has imaginary friends it's cute?  Well - in my opinion, it's just a bit freaky no matter what age you are.  I mean really a kid talking to an invisible friend is NOT right, that is just plain weird...the stuff that horror movies are made from!  An adult talking to an invisible friend well - just stay away from them.  Not to be confused with an adult talking to themselves however - that's fine.   - When people say, "Iâm so tired it's not even funny" or "my head hurts so much it's not even funny", why would it even be funny in the first place?   You have no sense of humor...I mean really, think about it - just a slight headache - Freaking hilarious!  God, makes me chuckle now just thinking about it...hehehe...and the tired part!  WOW - now that is humor!  But as in all things, there is a fine line...when you get too much of a good thing, well you know - that will generally spoil it.  Then it is just not funny anymore.   - Are children who act in rated 'R' movies allowed to see them?   Absolutely not, this little law is strictly adhered to.  They are allowed to see their own shots - but not in order, so they don't even know what the movie is about sometimes.  Now, however, if it is an R movie they will be allowed to come see it as long as they are accompanied by a parent or an adult guardian - if it is an NC-17 movie - no way jose!   - When French people swear do they say pardon my English?  Some English-speakers stereotype the French as permissive about anything risquÃ©. This was particularly true a hundred years ago when the phrase took off as an "apology" for swearing. "Excuse my French" or "Pardon my French" isn't just play-acting that you're speaking a foreign language. It's also a bit like saying, "I know those words are naughty - but maybe I could get away with behaving like that in France, where people are more tolerant of obscenity."  So, NO, the french do not say that.

       These are all important, but not necessarily in this order....    1. My favorite movie is Breakfast at Tiffany's, with Audrey Hepburn.  2. The feature I most like about myself is my smile.  3. The first thing that I look for in a friend/companion is a great sense of humor.  4. I absolutely, positively  HATE  onions.  5. My nails are done with a French Manicure.

       She has both of my kids this week and they are going nuts!  Lauren is crying all of the time, being a brat and picking on her big brother.  Alex is hitting her back, and just not listening!  They are a lot to handle and my poor mother is not used to this...I feel so bad for her.  I know that her and dad are certainly enjoying this time with the kids, but I also know how difficult it is for them.  I mean - all I want is for my kids to behave with others, it should be simple.  I believe that we are teaching and showing them proper manners, but then....I just never see it.  Anyway...so my kids are brats and they are being terrible to my mom...  I'm sorry mom, you always told me that you hoped I would get kids just like me...guess not though, these ones are bad...I know that I wasn't.

       Lots going on....Kids are still gone...(so sad - NOT!)  No really, I do miss them a bit, but I am having such a blast without them too.  This has been really great, and well needed for Steve and I.  We have had a terrific time so far, a week still to go.  Kids are having a great time up in Ohio...I think wearing my mom and dad out though!  They will be glad to see them go this time! ha-ha!  So what else...well....working on our kitchen finally...trying to tear all of the wallpaper off...having a #^$^%$&@ of a time doing it.  Oh well, when we get that done we are just plastering and painting the walls.  Should look good.  We'll see.  Sunday, Steve and I went out boating with some friends.  WOW, that was fun.  I hadn't been out in awhile, well deserved break.  We were out there all day, water skiing, tubing, swimming, eating and drinking.  Just wiped me out...and I got burnt too.  I need ALOE...ooohhhhh.  I kept trying to put lotion on, obviously didn't do it enough though...Oh well.  It's not all that bad.  I will Survive. (OH - awesome disco song...i will survive...I'm going to be singing that the rest of the day now...)  Anyway...tonight we are grocery shopping and doing laundry.  We need to work on the kitchen some more as well, but we are both too tired and sore for that.  We'll get to it later...yeah - right!

       Be alert to this one....  I hate people that forward those phony hoax warnings as much as anyone, but this one is important! Send this warning to everyone on your e-mail list! If someone comes to your front door saying they are conducting a survey on deer ticks and asks you to take your clothes off, do not do it.  IT IS A SCAM;  they only want to see you naked.  I wish I'd gotten this yesterday.  I feel so stupid and cheap now.

       OK...so no kids around the house, Steve and I are sitting on the couch in the living room and we start "fooling around" a bit...lol!  Then all of a sudden there is a knock at the front door, startled both of us good!  He jumps up to see who is there, it's our neighbor - just coming back from Egypt and he brought me a necklace that I had asked for - when Steve opens the door, our neighbor just leans in, gives Steve a big hug and pat on the back and says "I love you man".  We were just dying!  So funny!  Obviously saw us fooling around and was congratulating Steve! DAMN...hilarious...we moved to the bedroom then...

       Freedom!  So, last night, I went to Steve's softball game, then we went out and had some beer and wings!  We used to do that all of the time BK (Before Kids) and just haven't in ages...It was SO much fun!  We went to 3rd Base grill, it was really nice hanging out and talking to hubby - I love to spend time with him, he's my best friend!  Then we went home and...well - it was just a really nice evening *wink* *wink*.  haha!  I'm hoping last night was setting the pace for the rest of our time without kids!  We'll see.  Anyway, just wanted to keep you all updated.  Talk to you later!

       I've got a Gmail and 6 invites to pass out!  Hmmm....apparently this is some hot property!  There is a  urlLink swap list  of people trying to get a gmail account.  Is there anyone out there that is looking for this and doesn't have it yet?  Let me know and I can send you an invite!

       A bus carrying only ugly people crashes into an oncoming truck, and everyone inside dies. They then get to meet their maker, and because of the grief they have  experienced; he decides to grant them one wish each, before they enter  Paradise. They're all lined up, and God asks the first one what the wish is. "I want to be gorgeous," and so God snaps His fingers, and it is done. The second one in line hears this and says, "I want to be gorgeous too." Another snap of His fingers and the wish is granted. This goes on for a while with each one asking to be gorgeous but when  God is halfway down the line, the last guy in the line starts laughing.  When there are only ten people left, this guy is rolling on the floor, laughing  his head off. Finally, God reaches this last guy and asks him what his wish will be. The guy eventually calms down and says: "Make 'em all ugly again".

       So, I've finally done it.  I've signed up for an oil painting class at the Art Museum.  It starts this Saturday morning.  I can't wait to get into it again.  It's been years, well since I've graduated college, since I've painted.  Can I still do it?  Will I remember all that I have learned?  Well...it really doesn't matter, I'm just so psyched about getting back into it.  REALLY.  Ah, the masterpieces that I will be churning out...don't worry - I will share them with all of you, my faithful disciples.

       Yes, there is always something going on in this family...So...Alex developed a bladder infection like a week ago or so, he's over it now and all fine.  He was never actually bad - it just bothered him a little bit.  Anyway...so now we need to look into it, because apparently it is not common for children to get bladder infections, and even less common for young boys to get bladder infections....of course.  So we went to the Urologist yesterday, he ran a few tests - did an ultrasound.  He said everything looks pretty normal - it could be nothing, but it looks like there is a cyst on his kidney.  Hmmm...OK - a cyst, not so bad...lots of people have cysts right?  No biggie...well, it's a cyst on the kidney of MY BABY though!  If the Dr. had told me I had a cyst, it wouldn't have been a big deal at all...but for my boy to have one...now I'm just freaking out!  Yeah - I guess that's what mom's do.  So anyway, we go in again today to have another ultrasound done at another place and check it out a bit further.  So we shall see how that turns out and I will indeed keep you updated... I told him after the ultrasound today we will go do his school shopping.  We have to get all of his school supplies and some new clothes for school as well, he is growing like a WEED! LOL!

        What is it that makes a complete stranger dive into an icy river to save a solid gold baby? Maybe we'll never know.

       Boy did we have a blast up there!  We camped out all weekend in Cave City, KY - Mammoth Caves.  It was real fun.  We got bad thunderstorms Friday night, but it was beautiful the rest of the weekend.  Kids had a blast, and the adults did too!  I was worn out, really just beat after it was all said and done, but it was a good tired!  We went through the caverns on Sunday morning and that was really interesting.  It was a 2 hour hike through the caves - about 2 miles and it was cold in there!  We were prepared for it, thank goodness, so we stayed fairly warm.  Then we got back outside where it was just roasting hot and very humid.  Headed back home Sunday night after stopping for dinner and ice cream.  We ate SO much this weekend...food, food, food - my kind of camping trip!  All of the great camping food, cooked out over an open fire - YUM!  So, now I need to watch what I eat again and work this off!  Oh well, it was worth it.  Anyway, we are definitely planning on doing this again, it was just So much fun!  It was a good place too, almost exactly halfway in between us and my brother's in Cinci. - worked out well.  There was lots to do around there and we didn't do much of it....so next time we'll do more!  This trip comes highly recommended!
