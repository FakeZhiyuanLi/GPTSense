      So I had today off (Friday 5/21/04)… joy. As a result, I got to partake in one of my favorite pastimes. What per say would that be. Well like most 27-year-old single cats, Sloth, Lust and Gluttony are always in the line up. Today though I was in rare form.  After defiling myself at the local watering hole last night I had the extreme pleasure of sleeping till approximately 1:00 PM. Now it would be appropriate to assume that like most nights of debauchery, the evening ran into the wee hours of the morning. As a result I didn’t actually hit the rack until about 4:00 AM. So realistically I only scored about nine hours of shuteye. Compared to the to the six to seven I usually grab that may not appear a first glance to be all that big a deal. It was that almost better than sex morning sleep, though. The kind of slumber that bestows a wry sense satisfaction and accomplishment. Somehow you have put one over on the rest of the world and your body just oozes with unabashed warmth. Speaking of… I’m heading back to the rack. -Eger

      Heh.. got to love the Simpson’s... speaking of - work that is- I'm currently not doing it. Why pray tell... the same reason a dog licks it sack... So there I was slowing becoming more chemically unbalanced when I decided to start plugging random words and phrases into google in a selfless attempt to see what kind of entertaining and demented pages I could stumble upon ... (by the way beer.com is a procrastinators wet dream) So just then fates fickle friend (inspiration for you pure of heart) steps in and bang, like a freshman girl at the junior prom, my blog cherry was shattered... Which oddly reminds me of Mr. Smith... Adam Smith and that invisible hand of his… more like hand job... (unchecked free markets just like to fuck the masses) I like to be kissed when I’m being fucked Mr. Smith… Anyway, here it is my first blog... Much like a light beer, it probably didn't do much for ya and you’re not sure if you want another... Until next round…  -Eger

      When the cats away... well the mice eat rat poison and slowly die of thirst  (Chemicals are our friends people… at least that’s what the drug companies keep saying)  So as of late I’ve been experiencing what could be best characterized as a benign yet persistent feeling of cognitive dissidence. That would be the scientific term that marking gurus have assigned that uneasy feeling of dissatisfaction a customer may experience after a luxury purchase. This uneasiness keeps creeping out and attacking the quiet sense of accomplishment and the reasonable person logic I’ve been cultivating over the last five years. (Wasted time perhaps) The question of happiness (not just my own) but its nature seems to be weighing upon me as of late. I have dreamed a dream but now that dream is gone from me…   What dark design does this ash hart cradle Its amber glow amongst the billowing exchange Permeating, infecting truth Levying chaos betwixt reason and memory    I can’t prevent the chaffing  My tong wrought and swollen The ill fruits of anticipation and impending malice  Such lingering, cured benevolence (Pandora’s child)  Tracing the faint edges of misgiving, bound by shadow and ale   Rye smile in tow, the casual approach Pausing briefly within the fold A snapshot, frozen imperfection The gilded prize of concupiscence  Lofty tenets, sanguine desire Ethereal thoughts of yesteryear Decimated dreams my sweet friends  The petrified excrement of history
