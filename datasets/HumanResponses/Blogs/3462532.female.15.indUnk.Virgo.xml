       hello all  on friday I went to space (a youth group not the real thing) hehehe. There was not many people there this week which was a bit pants but it ws still fun except that stupid lindsey cross who decided that her and her homies would try and beat me up. haha. thanks ghigo for being a great body guard!! i owe you one.  saturday i went croydon with toni and tom came along too and moaned that we were doing girl shoppin. but he bought shorts for rome cause he is on holiday now as i speak. eerr or write. then we went to rachels and watched vidoes and big brother. I thought that when they said evil big brother that they meant there would be like witches and stuff in there but it wasnt. just gay people. when i say we went to rach's house i mean myself of corse and tom and aroon (sorry i duno how to spell his name hehe) and sam and emily. It was good fun except when we went outside to eat pizza and loads of fly and misquito things kept flying round me because i have sweet blood! hahaha well i do u no! and its not because i smell btw so shh. errrmm and thats that really. today i didnt do much but i am going to go to my step cousins 18th soon which should be interesting.  have a nice half term all!  bye xxx

      today is thursday and i am sitting next to swampy in IT. I am very bored, and am sending random insulting emails to swampster which is fairly amusing. err my cold has still not gone you no! its got worse and it hurts loads n loads wen i cough now. (hehehe no of corse i dnt want your sympathy!) charlotte has gone off to spain now and left me. woah is me! errrmm i have cadets tonite. A flight (i mean A flight the name not just A flite like a flight of birds u get me) are going on a fun trip to the police station. this should be quite fun i feel but one can never tell in truth. errrrr i have to go now cause Palmer is making me do some work. damn it. bye actually i have just come back now as it took me like 5 seconds. because of my vast intelligence of corse.  iTS 10.30 and iv come back from cadets. sadly nothing thrilling there. err we were sposed to go to the police station but that didnt exactly go to plan but o well. i just sat in the NCO room and ate biscuits and talked to cadets. but i did have to be duty NCO which was a bit of a bugger. The fit army cadet was on the gate so i was happy! nite nite im shattered. bye

      today i went to school. i woke up late so i had to run a bit. o well eh always good for the thighs. I had art in which i did shit all and made some COOL butterfly thing with like random bits of wire and tissue paper and then went about showing ppl it all day n making then tell me it was nice. hehe but it was very good i thought. I had mrs Lanky for maths and me n charlotte had not done our homework for the god knows how many time so we continued in pretending to mark homework we did not have and then she started singing her 'lalalalala' song which pisses me off so much so i pushed her and then she drew on me loads and then toni joined in but it was fun. I have like a cold o summing and i keep coughing like every second so i coughed loads today and am actually coughing as we speak. joy. In two days time it will be the start of the half term (whoooaaaahhhh) and that is good. I cant say i have anything planned but in general i never do. im guessing loads of sunbathing as i need to beat carter at suntan as it is unfair. roumer is that he uses fake tan. oooooooooo go spread the roumer go. (actually i just made that up you no but still spread it please) got to go now im having like some coughing fit. bye
