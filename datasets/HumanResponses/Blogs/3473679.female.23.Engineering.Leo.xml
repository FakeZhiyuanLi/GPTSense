        Today is one of the few days where I will eat out for breakfast, lunch and dinner!! I don't remember the last time it happened!  I found out that the business professor I work for went out of town, and she didn't even tell me!  This morning I was browsing the computer waiting for her to come in and I decided to check out some blogs from Brazilian...  I found a great one!  This lady can write! Here is the website:  http://jeitodeviver.zip.net/  very good, but sad.  It really made me feel bad about my blog... Oh well, I will get over it!  I gave up on waiting eventually, when I found out her mother had surgery and she went to DC...    I had lunch with a friend, she wanted to hear all about my trip to Honduras.  Which was great by the way!!!!  I wish I could have stayed there longer, but I THOUGHT I had work to do. Never mind that!  I met some great little girls there, I hope that I am able to keep in touch with them.  This weekend should be fun, I really hope that the weather stays great.  We will have fun out on the boat.  I wish they still had the ski boat, but o well...  sorry this is so short... I have a lot more to write, but no time!

      Hello!  My name is Lia Almeida and I am from Brazil.  I live in Auburn, AL.  I am in my second year of Graduate school for electrical engineering.  I am usually very busy, but this summer I am not taking any classes.  This is the first time I stay here without having to go to class, I love it!    This summer I decided to start ridding my bike everywhere during the day (I just started Tuesday).  So far so good!!!   It is actually a lot of fun!  It's a totally different world out there when you are riding a bike!  It is a little scary sometimes!  People around here drive with their minds in another world...  This morning I woke up a little late, I have been sleeping too much lately!  After working at the business building I went to have lunch at the conference center with the Dean, and the director of electrical engineering, and others.  There was some people from Scitor Corp. here, and the wanted an electrical engineering student to go.  It was very fun, the place is way nice!  They were very smart, and some things they talked about were over my head, but that is always fun!  After that I took my car to get the air conditioner fixed (now you know why I am riding my bike!!! Kidding), I hope it doesn't cost too much!  I have a fitness goal this summer, I am hoping to challenge my body a lot more than usual, I so out of shape!  Right now I am running 15 minutes almost everyday at 6 miles an hour, and at the end I am very tired!!! This is awful!  I want to be able to be able to run by the end of the summer, at least 30 minutes at 7 miles an hour!!! We will see!!!  I guess this is enough for today!

      Hey!  I kind of lost track of time!  I was going to write everyday but after the long weekend I got lazy.  Last week I had the appartment all for myself, Estevam was at a conference in Indianapolis and only got back yesterday.  It was good because I got to clean and organize the apt.  I had a hard time last week.  My advisor finaly got back from India and we had a meeting, I was counting on the fact that I was going to start working on the research project with the vet school.  But he didn't even mention it at the meeting...  Good thing that I was smart enough to find something in the business department, because if I was to depend on him I would be SOL.  I am not so upset now.  Since I am not working on the project I get to go home!  I can't wait... That is if I find a ticket that is not too expensive.  Estevam says I should go in the middle of July, because he will probably be studing like crazy.  I am thinking about it.  I hope I can stay 3 weeks.  Since my Mom can't come to the states anymore, I really miss her.  I didn't get to see her much during x-mas because she went to France with some friends...   Estevam still haven't heard about the Assistant Tennis Coach position... But now he decided that his true call is to coach the women's team, and it just so happened that position is also open.  I do believe he would be a better coach of the womens than the Men's.  This would be such a great opportunity to him, I am really praying that he gets the job.    Since I am not making much money, I am really having to watch what I spend.  I wish I started doing that in the begining of the year... I would have saved so much...  I made a spreadsheet to keep up with my spendings, and I went back and wrote the data since Jan 1st... So much wasted money!!!  I am not allowed anymore at the mall!!  Why does us women have this urge to buy, buy, buy???  I wish I could be brainwashed in order to be satisfied with what I have!  I do have a lot of stuff!  I buy it, and then I don't use it.  And I know I am not the only person that does that!    I am still running only 15 min, but I am getting better.  Today I am going to try to run for half an hour!!! A lot of it is just psychologic.  A lot of people don't think they can run, but with that attitude of course you can't!  That's why you have to start slow, allow yourself to walk when you get tired, and work your way up.  After a while you start enjoying, because you don't get so tired anymore, and you can just enjoy the view, or the TV in the treadmill in my case!  So now I hear that my professor went to a conference... But he didn't tell me, who told me was his PhD student thas share the office with me.  He also went to the conference.  He said that they left on saturday... I will see if he is at our meeting at 2pm.  This was another reason I was so upset, I couldn't believe he wouldn't tell me about that.  I could have stayed in Honduras for another week!  It was such a waste of time to come back early!!   Monday!!!  It really doesn't feel like it. Auburn is so empty!  I love it!
