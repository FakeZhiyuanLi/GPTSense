       urlLink Digby Neck in Stories 

Take the tour on this site, this is the reason we're going home-- thats the school I went to, and the one Travis will attend in the fall, my dad went to the one room school that came before it, and it really is a community place the place where we all come together for all occasions ....  and the neck really is a community, where all of our lives and stories come together... All of Travis' life, I've told him stories of home and explained to him starting with his middle name how his story is tied to the place, and no matter what the future holds for us, I know in my heart that this move is right for us, and it will all be worth it to have given him the opportunity to live within the story that is his heritage.

      Getting really excited about this move...  

I've found a couple of casual jobs for the fall, doing shore work for some fishermen, which makes me feel a bit easier about going home without the assurance of something full time.... And although I love the office environment, I've also really missed the physical labor, so it'll be nice to get back into that kind of thing...  Actually looking for ft work in a more labor oriented area too...

Registered my son in his new school today, and got a couple of good leads on some temporary spots to live while we work on the camp, one is at the lakeside that was my childhood home.  Travis has decided to extend his 3 day stay with gramma to the rest of the summer....  He's been fishing in the weirs and playing with his cousins, and he doesn't want to come back up the Valley.  Well, at least I don't have to worry about him adjusting to the move too much!!!  And it certainly is easier to get things done without him under foot....  I'll probably go visit him this weekend and put a few more feelers out in the employment department...

Our dog is loving it too... (she goes wherever travis goes) and she can go to the beach anytime she wants now...  she never was meant to be a town dog!  Its a bit lonely without either of them, but I'm pretty busy so it doesn't matter much except at night...

So thats this day so far...  

Back to work lol

      Well, day two since decision day, and I'm stalling here not sure where to start with all that needs to be done! 
 
Thanks to be given already to a couple of people, first to Darrin, for never having left, and for knowing what home means, and for not saying "you're crazy" but instead saying "If its in your heart and blood to be back there than thats where you should be."

And to Toby-- I met Toby a few years back when I adopted my dog from him (SURE you don't want her back???) He spent the day yesterday supervising my packing efforts and without the company and conversation I'm sure I wouldn't have accomplished half of what I did...  And of course for the three pile trick- pure genius lol!  You should be working for the government Toby lol!  And I'm gonna take you up on that break offer and swing out by the lake one of these evenings soon-- I'll bring my own water too :-)

Things to accomplish today:
 
 Call dad
 Call leonard
 Call kathy
 
then after those neccesary but still procrastinating calls:
 
 Choose  at least  three quarters of the library to sell...  (I hate this part, started it last night...  I love all the books that I've collected over the years...  but it's silly to lug them... and even to own them with the public library option)
 Choose five of the books I think I can't part with and release them with bookcrossing.com  (this is a beautiful idea-- check it out!)
 Take clothes to consignment shop (I sorted out a full half of my closets contents last night!  Still need to get rid of half of whats left, but haven't got the heart to do that just yet...  Rough night lol!  Any girlfriends who've always loved any certain item please ask for it!  It'd be a lot easier to give some of my favorite things to a  friend!)
 register Travis at DNCS, start looking for childcare! 
 pack up kitchen, side and front porches, hall closet (this will wrap up downstairs!!!)
  tsp downstairs walls and ceilings
 Arrange Canadian Diabetes pickup (these guys will come to your door and pick up donations of clothing and small household things once a month-- highly advised for the warm feeling!)
 Start in on Trav's room-- get rid of all the junk before he gets home, and let him sort out what he wants to keep of the good stuff (evil mom!)
 make something special for supper (cause I deserve a treat :-)
 Garage (optional today)
 
That should be enough...  well, my procrastinating served a purpose!  now I know where to start!  

Love you all :-)

      Hi Everybody,
 
Yep, I'm leaving Wolfville!  I hope to be out of here in 2 weeks time, which means an awful lot of work to do around the house to get it ready for the market and not so much time to get in touch with everyone individually (I will really try though, before I go, and if anyone feels like painting do feel free to stop by lol!)  If I don't get a chance to say proper goodbyes to you all, well, I promise to come back and visit, and please accept this impersonal mass email in the mean time:-) 
 
So why the short notice?  Well, the idea has been stored away in the back of my head for a couple of years now, but I didn't really realize that I was seriously going to do this until this morning when I was clearing out the kitchen cupboards to paint them and I realized that I didn't have any desire to put it all back when the paint dries...   In fact I don't even want three quarters of the stuff at all (I don't know why I have three spring-form pans, for example.  Yes, it does make me feel rather womanly to have a fully equipped kitchen, but actually, I don't think I've ever used one of them once,  Idon't  even really like cheesecake! lol)...  I've always said I wanted to get out of here and live simply, but the timing or the money or the job was never just right....  In reality, this place, lovely as it is, has never really felt like more than a temporary resting place on the way to, well, something less lol --and now that its  just me and Travis bouncing around  and trying to keep up with all the household stuff staying  has become quite ridiculous, but it's been comfortable in a safe kind of way...  And the timing still isn't perfect, but it's never going to be either.   I feel a certain relief having made the decision but I'm feeling a long way from comfortable!  But the decision has been made...  and now the race is on to get resettled before a new school year starts for Travis.
 
So, where am I going and what am I going to do when I get there?  Well, for starters, I'm going home to Waterford.  When Travis was a baby I promised myself  that I'd bring us back to the Neck  and our family before he got into elementary school, but here he is going into grade one and we're still here...  We've been settling, and someone said to me awhile back that "too often the good is the enemy of the best" and that's been weighing on my mind.... (I think they were referring to settling down with the wrong man, but since I'm unattached I took the liberty of shifting the context a bit lol) And with another school year fast approaching we've got to either jump now or stay again till June.  We're selling everything worth selling, and junking the rest (scary).  I can't realistically get everything done that I need to in the Valley before school starts, so Travis will likely stay with Gramma for the first week while I take care of loose ends....  In the meantime, the selling of everything part should be enough to make it possible for us to have Leonard start building us a little camp, and I'll help with that once I get down there... (in the interim, we'll stay in one of my brother's logging camps)  getting firewood at this time of year is the biggest issue, but doable...  running water is something we won't worry too much about until next year...  and we'll wire the camp but worry about energy sources other than wood and kerosene a little further down the road.   We'll set up temporary camp on a piece of moms 200 acres while we test drive this idea for the winter.  Come spring we'll probably be looking for a bit of land to call our own so we can spread out a bit and start taking care of some of the comforts.   I know it all sounds crazy, but those of you who know me well know that all I've ever wanted is a two room camp, a couple of brown chickens, and to be free of all the extra junk.  Which is a scary thought even to me, and to be honest, I'm not 100% sure that I can do it.  The idea wasn't scary when Johnny and I talked about doing the same thing in Cape Breton, but doing it alone  scares me, and the challenge of staying clean and sober through the stresses that are bound to come is  scary too, but we're gonna give it an honest go for a year  because I'm sick of saying that this is what I want and not doing it just because it's not going to be easy. Besides, if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.  Well, that's no big deal! :-P
 
Well I realize that I'm using this email to work out my feelings just as much as I'm using it to let you all know that I'm off....  I could keep going with the entire pros and cons list I've been composing in my head for months, but suffice it to say that the pros have won out loud and clear (albeit in a very untimely manner), and we'll work the cons out as we deal with them one by one.  
 
So, I'm here for what's left of August and hopefully not too much of September, and after that you can track me down (or at least an answering machine that will know a bit more than I do just now) at my moms landline which I swear she only maintains as a central forwarding number for all her wayward children, 902.834.2228.  I probably won't bother too much with email, but I'll transfer my address book to the  necker_girl@hotmail.com  account before going, and I'll try to remember to check it from the CAP site often enough to keep it active, and then the good old fashioned one, my mailing address will be RR#4, Digby, NS, B0V 1A0.  And if you ever find yourself down the Neck, do swing by!  
 
With Love and Crossed Fingers,
Georgia, Travis, and Mutt
