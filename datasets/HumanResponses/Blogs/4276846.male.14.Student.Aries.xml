       Today I woke up on the floor (as I was sleeping over my cousins house) WITH A TERRIBLE NECK ACHE. I obviously slept in a bad position. I had breakfast and then we left our cousin's house. When I arrived home I went on the web (checking and writing my blog) and talked to my friend Sean Fong (his blog is   urlLink  http://brainynerd.blogspot.com    ).  After I had finished talking to Sean, I watched the 3rd Semifinal of Australian Idol. The judges were very nice even Ian 'Dicko' Dickson, the nasty, mean judge. Due to them being nice it was quite boring to watch as I like the judges being nasty to untalented or talented singers who do not sing very well.  After that I had an early night as it was a school night and I was quite tired.  Until tomorrow   C'ya

       Today I had a well deserved sleep in. I woke up at around 9 am. On tv I watched the Olympics (2 channels have 24 hour coverage). I was hoping that England could win a few more gold medals as they were not doing very well. Fortunately they won a few medals mainly in rowing and cycling. My parents went to a party so we all went to my cousin's place (my aunty and uncle also went to the party)  and for the first time ever our whole family slept over there. While my parents went to the party, my grandparents babysitted. They always make our time with them enjoyably. When my parents came back (at around midnight), I was trying to go to sleep but there was lots of talking and light so I couldn't go to sleep until 3am, which wass quite annoying. Anyway, our Saturday ws ok but not great.

      I live in Perth. If you do not know where Perth is well get an atlas. Hint: It is somewhere in this Galaxy.  My family consists of 5 members: me, my mum Brenda, my dad Gavin, my 12 year old brother Sam (who is the most annoying boy ever) and my sister (who does not want to be named)  I used to come from England but emigrated in 1996 to Perth. Since then I have been to two schools:  - St. Andrews Grammar (a greek school) where I was there since 1996-2002 (from year 1 to Year 7). I loved that school, the kids there were so nice as well as the teachers where they were so easy to get along and I got a great education. At the end of the year, there is an awards night and I got 7 awards (6 for academic excellence {6 years in a row} and citizenship). I'm sure some of the other smart people were glad for me to go as they wanted an award but anyway. I moved after year 7 because my mum wanted me to have the best facilities (I later learnt that a school is all about quality not quantity). On my last day I was extremely sad and didn't want to leave but eventually i pulled away.  - John Septimus Roe Anglican Community School is my current school. I joined last year (2003). On my first day I was extremely nervous however I did know a few people there so that helped (Around three people from my old school were suppose to go to JSR as well but they pulled out at the last minute). Some of the teachers are good but some are the worst and I came away learning minimal (My engish teacher last year was not fantastic last year so blame him if i make some grammatical errors). I've made some good friends but some people are not very nice. I am looking forward to the future whether it will be a good or a bad ending to my schooling.  Well that is me, josh2803 and wait to see the next posts i create.
