      Ive been thinking about things.  To me the general population is stupid. They are happy with petty desires and hopes and aspirations. In the mind of them celebreties are cool. TO be honest i dont care about david beckhams new haircut, and i dont care about a bunch of whiney teenager popstars.   Its just like the book 1984. The dumb people are left to their own devices. They are given a choice of beer and a choice of celebrities to follow they are happy. Meanwhile the interlectuals are not allowed to do anything "big brother" is scared that they will break the rules (and goto room 101).    Im sure that the dumb people of this country, who have children at the age of 13 and their aspiration is to work in macdonalds, will one day realise that they are petty, and narrow minded. But maybe they are too dumb to even do that. Their mind poewr is all used up on the celebrity cult which has possibly even taken over religion.  People's lives are so empty that they have to follow someone elses.   Its pathetic

      I currently play Americas Army (www.americasarmy.com) which is an online based shoot em up game. It is made by american government people to try to recruit people into the army. Cracking game, superb grfix, and great gameplay. The other bonus is that it is free. My name is "aahamiboy" on it, so if you play it look out for me.... im the one who sucks.  The other game i play is counterstrike. It is simialr but at a much faster pace. You have to buy halflife the game in order to play it. Then you goto www.steampowered.com and download steam and install counterstrike. Its amazing the amount of people who play it. Word of warning... its massively addictive.  Lineage 2 is a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game) where you take the role of a mage or fighter. Usually of a elven or drarven race. I loved this game when it was free. It was the best game i had ever played, but then they introduced a price to play it, you pay $13 a month or something, but being only 15 its hard to find money when you need to buy magazines cinema tickets and train fares...

      I am currently in training for a trek in belize.... I am going out walking with my huge rucksack on. Almost as big as me! lol  MY dog enjoys the exercise, but i come home red and sweaty, knackered to the depths of my bones.  I dont know about all you lot, but i love cofee, and have started drinking a lot of it, to help keep my mind focussed when im revising. Its all very fun.  You can tell im new at blogging, nobody has left a comment on my page, and i feel very lonely now. lol.  Im hoping that someone will stumble accross it, leave commetns and tell people about it. That would be swish.

      I have just had my first real look of some bloggs on here... TJ's place is a very good blogg. Interesting and funny. Sadly nobody seems to visit mine... maybe i need to make it more appealing.  If anyone out there know an easy computer language that they can teach me please get in contact.. i could really do with some help.  I have noticed that some people have created bloggs about food, now food is a subject i can talk about... I love food. Im always eating food (mainly as im growing a lot at the moment and need lots of energy).  Im listening to the sex pistols, good olf johnny rotten. Hes classic.  On TV in britain at the moment is a program called "Big Brother" Now for those who are unfamiliar with BB, it is a documentary sort of thing about 12 housemates (ordinary people) who are locked in a house for 10 weeks, with cameras everywhere. Basically you can see everything they are doing. Although i find the people on them arrogant and annoying, i find it amusing. It is mainly the clash of cultures which makes it funny, people arguing over things that dont matter. People bitching about eachother behind evryones backs. 2 faced people accusing others of lying.  Well enough of Big Brother. more about issues. About the war in Iraq. I am for the war in general. I feel that sadam hussain was mental, and had no right to run the country. He was a facist dictator and has no right to even control a shoebox let alone a country. I hope that the situation in Iraq improves and the people can elect a government of their own choice.

      I live in a small village in England. I love sports, walking and music. I try to keep up to date with modern issues, but if someone posts something which i do not know about, you can be sure that i will research it to the max before i make a pointless response.  I am nearing the end of my GCSE's (exams much like the american finals) and will now have more time to do things like blog.  Next month i am going on an expedition to Belize with my friends. We are spending a month in Belize and aim to trek through the jungles to a remote viallge in the north east (cant remember the name off hand). We will then help build a school or lay water pipes. Which i believe will be a once in a lifetime experience.  Currently i am into older music: for example  Queen  Adam and the ants The stranglers The rolling stones  My alltime favourite band is Muse. They produce rock music which is passionate, energetic and full of emotion.   Does anyone else like Muse?  What are your favourite bands / styles of music?

      Well, i am new to this blogging business. I am going to attempt to show people how a 15 year old boy thinks about certain issues: music, politics, sport and Girls.  As i am new dont expect a flashy blog, i am sure that with help i will soon be up to standard. I will feel gratefull if people send me suggestions. (alex.hamilton@gmail.com)  I encountered blogging this morning whilst surfing the net, it looks very interesting and i suppose this is a test to see what it is like.  Can people help me by posting interesting posts and not abusing this blog in anyway.   Thanks and happy viewing

      Well, there is football on in the other room. Its not that im unpatriotic or something but i just cant be arsed to sit still and watch a bunch of overpaid wankers kick a ball around. People get violent over footie... why? Its really sad. There should be other programs on, like groundforce..... That would be swish.   2ndly, I often find myselfon this computer with nothing to do, so i make games in my head. Or visit rather funny sites. For example www.madblast.com Its a site with funny little games to play and little flash films to watch.  I have been getting a few more posts and visits on this site, which is good. I like people to read stuff i write.  My dog is so cool, and as soon as i figure a way to put pictures up (without that "hello" thing which doesnt work) I will post a nice piccy of her..  Im thinking of changing the layout of the page.. Id better save my script codes now.  Il talk again later

      Well today i was walked to our local shop.. Being rather cool with my money, i decided to walk around and see what there was. To the horror of horrors they were not selling "tuc" biscuits.   I always buy "tuc". Now there is "mini sesame sead tuc," they taste like someone has let a donkey leak onto to a twiglet, and they put them in a bag.   Eugh!  Another thing, They now sell Rolos, mini rolos, giant rolos, and biscuit rolos.. I was spoilt for choice people.

      its been a few days since i last posted. I have been busy revising. I tried to get to blogger.com from school, but it was blocked.... grrr....  I was reading a poetry book by Tim Burton called something or other (i cant actually remember the name) and it was really funny.   It was a bit childish but i though it was hilarious. The poems had titles like "the boy with nails in his face" and "stain boy"  It was all very smooth.  I have completed all of my exams and am now looking foward to doing work experience and such.. Oh the joys!!!  Another thing, when somebody tells you not to do something you immediatly do it, even if accidental. For example :  My mum told me to wear an apron whilst eating pasta with tomato sauce, as i was wearing a white shirt. Normally i dont spill any at all. But today after i finnished i looked down and to my horror there were about 5 dots of source. I ran upstairs to get changed. I was upset at myself for being an ass and not wearing the fucking aporn. lol.

      Being English, i feel that i have a sort of natural hatred for the french (kind of harsh i know, but i just hate them). I do know a few french people who i like, but the french in general really annoy me.  Something that made me laugh was (i heard it somewhere) there was a wine tasting competition in france somewhere, and the British sparkling white wine beat the French champagne!!  They must be really pissed off as wine brewing is the one and only thing that they are good at.

      Well, its about quarter to 10 here. Im quite tired, although i havent done much.  To be honest i feel very impressed with the site so far. I have had a few posts by a few faithful readers, and ive only been on here for a day or so.  I got a friend to join up, bu i think he only wants a gmail account. He wont get one... lol  I got one for offering a teabag to the person who sends me an invite.  If you really want one, a good site is www.gmailswap.com  Just read it through.   I would really appreciate if people mailed me with any suggestions or topics they want mentioning. I would be happy to post things people want to discuss.   I must get up early tomorrow to goto school, oh joy of joys.  And if Dan returns (which i hope he does) i want to thank him for the help, and I think i have turned on my atom thing. I even put a link to the atom site feed on the right on the toolbar thing.  I might post again tomorrow evening if im not revising.  One last thing, a question: Does anyone know how to make a blog more widely availible to people?  I know there is the noted blogs on the blogger.com homepage. How do i get on that, or if there are anyother ways.  Some people write jounals and things, which are not really intended for a vast amount of viewing (yet they are still interesting to read) I want this site to be a sort of jounal and discussion area. Or area for stories. (much like Tj's place [link on the right])   Alex

      Well, im sitting here drinking tea. The weather is dreadfull.. Rain, been raining most of the afternoon now. It is supposed to be summer.  Earlier i went out with my dog, i came home and did some revsion. The thing is i procrastinate. I just put it off, even though i know how important it is. Usually once i get down to it i can revise for ages, but this afternoon i didnt really get into it. I probably only did an hour or so...   At the moment, my favourite blogg is Tj's place. I went through a whole archive just now. Kevin has a style of writing which is unique. Even if hes talking about something which is really boring, he makes it sound exciting and funny. I wish i had that tallent for writing.   Im starting to learn basic html, and managed to put some links to other good sites. If you want your site linked from here just tell me and il put it in for you. (that is if i think you are worthy of having a link on my site)  There is a definate air of sunday gloom. Its very overcast here. I prefer the sun, no doubt il get a lot when i goto belize.  Im getting into this blogging thing now, maybe one day more people will look at my site... that would be cool.

      I was comming back from a BBQ on a train. I had just been out having a gd time with some friends. I was with my mate Daniel. But there was a problem, the train was being delayed due to train wreckers (people who go around smashing up the train). I was listening to music at the time so did not hear the announcement. When i saw the looks on peoples faces, i asked a nearby man (he must have been in his fourties) what was going on. His reply was "People like you, of your generation are ruining the train, sodding children"  Now this was not fair. I had not done anything, i was merely sitting there on the train listening to music with a mate. It wasnt loud, i hadnt done anything to aggrevate this man. Yet he saw fit to have a go at me.  I replied to him "i havent done anything, why are you blaming me?" his reply was "im not blaming you, im just saying people like you are..." This was starting to get on my nerves by now. "so your saying that on other occasions I go around and smash up trains" He did not reply. Then a woman (early 20's) piped in for me she said to the man "i think you are being very general in your accusations." "why dont you keep out of it woman" was his reply.   At this point i could not take any more, so i moved seats to get away from this really annoying man.  I came to the conclusion that a few people are getting all young people a bad reputation. These people are usually Dumb, they just think its funny to cause havoc and get drunk. Well, the truth is that It is gaining the whole of our generation a reputation, a bad one.   It is my opinion that now every person of my age has been attacked, either verbally or physically.  Most of us have done nothing wrong. And the few emptiheaded pikeys who stand around intimating people and trash public transport, are so wrapped up in their individual world (or maybe they are just to sttupid) to realise that they are ruining it for everyone else of their genertion... Losers

      Most Girls of my age have probably been on a diet before. Some of them may have needed to, but im sure that others wouldnt have. Mainly, i see that the whole celebrity cult, and girls magazines are to blame. Every time we watch TV we see very beautiful very slim celebrities. They have usually got boyfriends or are married. The girls who see this, or read about it in a magazine are just going to think... "well if im thinnner then il get a boyfriend." We should not be angry at them for doing this, but we should feel that they have lost their willpower and have fallen into the depths of the celebrity cult (allthough in a different way to some) And i do accept that some people go on diets for genuine reasons. But the human body wasnt made for dieting... The best way to lose weight is to exercise... go out running every day.   Its early here, il be back later... I have to awalk my dog and do revision.
