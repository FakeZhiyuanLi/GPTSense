      I've been playing Magic for about&nbsp;six months now.&nbsp; I've gotten pretty good at it, and believe, finances permitted, I could compete with anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also come to the conclusion that there are two kinds of players in this game.&nbsp; There are those that beatdown, and win early.&nbsp; There are also those that play, can win fast, or, can make you draw out, or just&nbsp;wear&nbsp;you down till you concede.&nbsp; There is also the bad players, but we won't talk about them, they suck.&nbsp; I agree, beatdown is absolutely the most fun to win with, but on an everyday basis, not my choice.&nbsp; To me, everyone can play the game where beatdown will win fast, you jus' have to have the cards to do it with, effectively.&nbsp; Beatdown is so fun, but it isn't a true test of your ability to manipulate the cards, and ultimately, your opponents.&nbsp; My goal, as far as MTG is concerned, is to find a T2 second or third turn win, but there has to be a backup plan.&nbsp; Damn counterspells can ruin a Vengance or Tooth and Nail.&nbsp; Trinisphere can absolutely kill raffinity,&nbsp; and goblins, Oct. 20, those and elves, for the most part, will be gone.&nbsp; What do you do to recover from a counterspell, or some black bs that wipes out your little ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tell ya what, since I play this game alot, and if you read this, than you prob' do to.&nbsp; Figure the cards out, play them out, in your head vs. another effective deck, see where you can go, against whatever it takes. Lata!

      Hey all, Dogg here.&nbsp; I've been a jock, athlete all my life, and have been blessed with my athletism.&nbsp; In high school, I was one of those people everyone knew, and I'm pretty sure everyone liked.&nbsp; If they didn't, it was because, well, I was a friggin' jock.&nbsp; Arrr.&nbsp; I was a foot taller than everyone else, could dunk a basketball when I was eleven years old, and could compete on a high school level at that same age in every single sport.&nbsp; Every basketball coach in Oklahoma knew who&nbsp;I&nbsp; was  when I was in the 7th grade.&nbsp; What is funny about all that is the fact that things tested my brain and ability to strategize have never any kind of interest to me.&nbsp; Agreed, the absolute best athletes in the world have the ability to use their brains in such a way that all us other really talented athletes didn't.&nbsp; Hence the success of professional athletes over, well, me.&nbsp; Not saying that I was stupid, or didn't know how to put my head where it needed to be, I was just using for&nbsp;the wrong things.&nbsp; Sports, every single one, was very important to me then.&nbsp; But only the good parts.&nbsp; Ya'know, dunkin' a ball, hittin' a homerun, or scoring touchdowns.&nbsp; The little things that it took to win was what all the talent I had was lacking the most.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I'm older, have lived a little, I&nbsp; realize the&nbsp;&nbsp;reason&nbsp;why my talent never took me anywhere.&nbsp; I was gifted in such a way that I cannot believe that I never made it to any professional ranks.&nbsp; But to be able to do the things that I was able to to will always be overshadowed by that inability to realize what exactly it takes to be the very best.&nbsp; This is my documentation that I, yeah, I realize what I did, and,&nbsp;if you're reading this, and have even mediocre talent, don't waste it. You can be great with far less than what I had.&nbsp; Jocks, wake up a learn the finer points of your respective sports, and maybe, you'll live my dream for me.&nbsp; Lata!

      Yea, my metabolism is slowing down a bit. I'm getting fat.  Really, I'm 6'7", topping the scales at 190, I think it's time to do what everyone else is doing.  The tried and true Atkins. Yep, avoid those pesky carbs.  Yea, think that might work.  Or I could just eat normal, and EXERCISE!  Hey, I think that beats the Atkins diet anyday.  Stupid Atkins diet.  Yes, it is true that carbs can cause you to gain wait, but only if you let it.  Regular exercise and activity can keeps those carbs at bay.  They're there to give us a lil' more energy, so we can turn around and burn them right off.  This world wants it the easy way, and to diet like that is the perfect example.  We NEED those carbs,  yes, watch yourself, and your carb intake, but don't make yourself suffer!  I did weight training on and off for the last few years, and my diet consisted of high carbs, chicken, and lots of milk.  Well,  I maintained a nice lil' sixer and only until recently, due to a stupid injury, have I had to actually contend with gaining in the wrong places.  Just thought I'd vent, since the last three commercials on t.v. all had to do with the Atkins.  By the way, there is no way I'd go on any kind of diet,  I'm so damn skinny, I'd probably die.  Lata!

      Well, this past weekend was MLB's all-star weekend.  My greatest time of year.  It is the time of the year to reflect on the performance of the best players in each league, and, of course, the homerun derby.  This year, there was so much emphysis on the longball and Roger Clemens.  Well, with my luck, I dozed before the first pitch, and didn't come to until the 8th inning.  Shit!  Doesn't matter, it was in the air for me. I love the game so much, that to miss a few innings really isn't a problem for me.  I still get goose bumps when I watch a regular season game.  Even though all the players I grew up with have all retired, except Clemens, I realized this past weekend that I'll never give up on the game.  Through scandals, strikes, and the occasional ridiculous trade, I will die loving almost every aspect of the game.  I can loose myself watching old black and white games on the classic ESPN, or even the old baseball movies.  Those newer ones, like Bull Durham, really piss me off.  The Natural, what's up with that?  At least get an actor that could pull off being "the natural".  I can go on for days about baseball, and if I was to loose my eyesight, well, I'd still be able to imagine the smell of the grass, hear the sounds of the game, and be in my most comfy place, lost in the world of the greatest game of all time.

      I could come up with a thousand more, but that one has stuck with me since I was a child.  I'm sure it's all simple, and probably stupid, bit I don't care.  Where does this whole world come up with anything at all?  Why did we evolve the EXACT way that we did?  I'm sure there is a scientific reason for all this, and I probably know the explanations for a few, but what fun it is to speculate!  Why does spit bubble, or toenails get gross and funky when we get old.  Why does the moon just happen to be white, and why on earth is there so much water on this planet that we can't drink? My sister once asked me where do they get the middle bun for a Big Mac?  I got insider info on that one, but I haven't told her yet.  Yes, I'm sure there are many people who can answer these questions,  but I don't need the answer. I don't want them.  I believe that life is always much better if we don't know as much as we could.  Leave that other ninety percent of our brain alone, we're much better off without it. To find out life exists elsewhere, in ANY form, could be great, or it could be bad.  No telling how many people have asked this same question before, and why am I asking it now?  Well, just because.  Don't humor me or you with answers, please, part of the fun of life is not knowing.  I can't wait to not find anything out, it's so much fun!

      Check it out.  I built this deck out of an idea this dude gave me online.  He was bouncing the Viridian Shaman in and out of play, while turning all my elves into artifacts and wiping them out.  I thought that was cool, and thought I'd go ahead and build a deck around that combo.  I didn't realize just how effective it would be.  Here goes:  4 Neurok Transmuter                      4 Eternal Witness 2 Troll Ascetic 4 Viridian Shaman  4 Oxidize 4 Crystal Shard 4 AEther Vial 4 Condescend 4 Serum Visions 3 Last Word 3 Thirst for Knowledge  Sideboard: 4 Myr Landshaper 4 Echoing Truth 1 Thirst for Knowledge 4 Annul 2 Conjurer's Bauble  Lands: 8 Islands, 8 Forests, 4 Darksteel Citadel.  Alright, you get the idea of this deck.  Even if you do, I'm gonna lay it out cuz I'm bored.  The basic idea is to control every move your opponent makes.  Starting with countering early game spells, such as opposing Troll Ascetics and such.  AEther Vial is what I always make sure and top deck with.   It lets me play every creature for free(they all have the same converted cost), and lets me throw a Shaman on my opponents turn.  The Transmuter lets me turn all their creatures into artifacts, thus letting me wipe them out easily with Oxidize and the Shaman, over and over.  Eternal Witness is there to let me get all my counterspells and Oxidize back to do it all over again.  Troll Ascetic is there to handle a huge Ravager, and not die, as well as a little bit of beef.  Its fun to watch a Raffinity deck attack with all there creatures, sac all but one to the Ravager, wait for me to block, then I turn their Enforcer into a blue creature, cancelling out the Ravagers mod ability, then Oxidize. Good times.  The Landshaper is sideboarded for Tooth and Nail decks, and protected from artifact removal thanks again to the Transmuter.  Sometimes, I like to take the Crystal Shard out against artifact removal, and throw in the Vedalken Mastermind, and he's even cheaper, with the same effect, only with my own permanents.  So fun, ya should try it out.

      This last week, I was helping my boy Andrew and one of his bosses do some work.   We were replacing a window in one of the trailers that they work in.  Well, since I don't have a job, because of this stupid injury, Andrew comes and picks me up and takes me out to his job so I don't become to terribly bored.  We play Magic and talk alot of shit about....shit, anything to keep me from going completely insane.  Anyway, on this particular day, his "other" boss(his real boss is on vacation), needed some help putting in this window.  I didn't do anything to help, really, except screw in the screws.  With my go-go gadget abilities, I could reach those high as hell screws and took it upon myself to do the rest of the job.  As we finished, Andy casually made the comment about me being injured on the job, and me being on workmans comp.  His jackass of a boss for a week made the comment"Well, I hope you didn't pull a muscle!"  What kind of shit is that!?  If it was just a muscle, I would be working.  It happened six months ago!  I've never been injured in my life.   Work is one of the things that has always made me...me.  I wouldn't let a little mucsle injury keep me from working.  I'd be one of the first to drown my eyeballs in sweat.  I love to work, I need to work.  It is a-friggin'-shame that this world has let so many people get away with freeloading off being "injured". Almost naturally, all the self respect I have is almost totally gone anyway.  I just know that some people think that I am not hurt.  Doctors haven't proved anything, and I personally think my lawyer thinks I'm just trying to get a free ride, er, whatever.   I don't even care what happens, I just want to be fixed.  I just wish this world hadn't made it so hard for those of us who are really hurt.  I'm only 27 yrs. old.  Way to young to be suffering from a stupid neck injury.  Sucks that one of the hardest injuries to find and fix just happens to be the one I have.  Sorry, just had to vent.  I love you, Nikole.
