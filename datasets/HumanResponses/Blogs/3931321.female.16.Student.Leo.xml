      Guttermouth - She's Got The Look  Arg. Today I went to town and got nothing. It was really hot. I saw a lot of people I knew. Other than that it sucked. I hate it how you see people that you NEVER EVER EVER talk to ususally and they get all friendly and call you "Megs". At BK (as if not enough funny htings happen at BK...) I was getting food and teh girl who was at the cash did not stop staring at me.. even when I looked at her back.. mom thought that was funny... I was thinking that mabey she was trying to read hte pins on my hat or something. Mabey not. Mabey there are more BK lesbians than the two me and Tiffany know.  I got home and went up the souwest nad it was broing hardly anyone was around and everyone was all sick and did not feel well so no one went swimming. Then we were told that someone called the cops on us since we were "blocking" the road. They heard it on the scanner. So we all left jsut because it would be simpler to leave than to stay and get told to move.. I need to think of a new name for Brittle Boy (jordan) since he doesn't like that name... LOSER!! lol jk  Then I watched 28 Days.. which i thought would be a really cool movie but it was really boring. I thought that there would be more action or something.. but their wasnt.

      Misfits - Last Caress Today I went swimmin with Jemma and  urlLink Caroloo  up at the bridge. There were all these weird french/native people putting their tubes on the raft which prevented anyone else from using it. Bastards.. there was a movie on tv the other day called bastards... true story... but i watched it and it was liek a documentary.. and they ate muffins.. ANYWAYS.... Caroloo had this bag and then it turned into a dirty water bag. Then we got cold and went home. Meatlof tried to have a vacation in Red Bank and meet the whore dogs down there but he did not end up going.

      Listening To - Operation Ivy - These Boots Were Made For Walkin'  Today was a weird day. Maya woke me up at 2 cuz Grind was comming on at 2:15 or soemthing and I wanted to watch it again. While we watched grind I braided Maya's hair in little braids.. yesterday I parted it all and put littel elastics in so it would be easier to braid it hte next day. It only took about 30 mins to braid it but still the little bitch complained. Mom "cooked" a turkey for supper it was gross. I dont know how she does it but mom always manages to fuck up. The turkey basically was in two pieces by the time it was done cookin.. yeah my moms a bad cook. I fell asleep and didint wake p until 8 so i had way more than enough sleep so now i am right wired.  Last night i got in a lil fight with this guy.... and he called me a stupid head among other things,, but hey he is in level 3.. hes not smart. stupid head must have been the best thing he could have thought of. L  Last night as well a few of these people whom i do not know kidnapped me and forced me to do things that involved darkness and a lot of pulling.... lol. Mom questioned hwat i brought home and maya thinks my souvieners are pretty cool. she wanted to put them on her bike but nooo.

So that means I might get the mohawk.. or just get my damn hair cut. It seems so long ago since I had my "normal" hair. People are still bitchy.. more or less the same.

        The last few days have been a  mush of no sleep or too much.  I hate how in the days seem to run together.... I actually kept thinking that today (Friday) was either Wednesday or Tues.. until I looked to see what was using the shows that were comming on.. yeha.. I do watch too much television.   Last night   (I think it was last night..   ya it WAS last night!!  )&nbsp;We (myself. Carolyn. Jemma and Vanessa)  all went to Carolyn's sisters house and watched tv.... did some other stuff... and did not go to sleep till about 5?  Then I came home and went to bed. Did not wake up till about 3. I am trying to remember what  (if anything)  I did Wednesday night.... was that DQ adventures in the topaz? I cannot recall. And no I do not have a  drug problem . Its a  SLEEP  problem.&nbsp;   In the meanwhile I am peeling like crazzzzzy from a sunburn I got a week ago... I HATE PEELING! Blah. Nasty Shit.

      Today was a boring day. I was laying in the liivng room chillin out with my cookies when Hamilton called and was like "dude come up. let's go swimmin'" So we went swimmin. We got some lovely FRENCH beer thrown at us... (I have always said that french people should die!! So I am saying it again!). I got in a lil fight with a red haired kid who is about 13. So after he almost died... me and hamilton and vanessa and jodee went crusin in the TOPAZ to Dairy Queen. We also saw the Topaz's twin... whose name is Marcel. So we went cruisin' home playing with some MARSHMALLOWS!! and windows. and even the fuckin' doors. Yeah. We ARE RETARTED!     ........and that was my day.. I have a hair appointment 'morrow. TO FIX MY EDGAR! (thanks carolyn!)I really wish that people would fuckin' be online so I can talk to hem But sadly... they are losers and not spendin their night on MSN!
