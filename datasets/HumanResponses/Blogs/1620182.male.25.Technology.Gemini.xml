      it's time.  i've the forum, and now i need the audience.  perhaps i should think of a really interesting topic.  yes, that's what i need.  no one enjoys reading the random thoughts of some anonymous, utterly average author.  maybe i should grow a  urlLink sense of humor  or ponder just who's on which side of the  urlLink matrix  or become a  urlLink girl .  honestly, this whole blogging thing is new to me, so you'll have to bear with me.  in the mean time, feel free to punish my 1MB  urlLink inbox limit .

        "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil - prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore - Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore - Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."                                         Quoth the raven "Nevermore."  --  urlLink E. A. Poe     Obviously, there is a fine line between ignorance and beligerance.  I mean, come on!  The dude just lost his girl.  I don't mean misplaced-lost, either.  And you're going to taunt him like that?  But how can you get mad at a bird?  The situation, yeah, sure, maybe.  But the bird?  No.  So when your laptop crashes and your digital camera deletes your vacation pictures, you can't exactly get mad.  You can't even get even.  You have to suck it up and move on with your life.  Afterall, what's more important?  Honestly, people.  Hippie:  "Whoa! Man, you just ran through a big pile of dogsh*t!"  Forrest:  "It happens."  Hippie:  "What, sh*t?"  Forrest:  "Sometimes."

       "You say that as if it's my fault."  -- Space Ghost coast to coast.  It's official.  The laptop is in the infirmery.  Let's all have a moment of silence for it.......Thank you for your attention.  You know, I was actually hoping that I'd somehow be able to weasle myself into a new laptop, but that's not looking so likely now.  The repair guy at work said he thought it was the mother board.  Honestly, people.   If you need to replace the mother board, shouldn't you just get a whole laptop along with it?  Especially when this one is about 1/1000 the power of the latest and greatest?  Whatever.   As long as it works.  I finished Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on the plane back from Vegas yesterday.  What a fantastic read.  I'm now 2/3 of the way through the next book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  I've quickly come to realize something about these books.  The whole reason I'm reading the first two (despite seeing the movies already) is because I was told by a friend that they wouldn't make sense out of order.  What a load of horse dung.  These books are totally written as episodes.  There were parts in the Prisoner of Azkaban where Rowling rehashes what happened in the first book (the scar, the Dursleys, Hogwarts, etc).  I somehow suspect that the same thing will happen in the fourth episode, the Goblet of Fire.  For some, this type of repetition will get old very quickly.  I, on the other hand, don't really mind it at all.  Life is repetitious, and Rowlings does a good job of bringing points from the past up when the reader needs reminding.    What I find most shocking about the tale is how Harry Potter has not been herolded as the magical savior he is.  I mean, he's faced off and defeated Voldemort (the Wizard so terrible that nobody will say his name) three times before the age of thirteen.  He single handedly (well, mostly) protected the sorceror's stone, found the chamber of secrets, killed a giant snake, and lead his team to victories in Quidditch nearly every time he's on the field.  This kid is 13.  How is he not on the cover of every magazine?  The subject of every television special?  It's amazing.  The teachers at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry treat him as if he's another boy....simply amazing.

       "I'll see your seventeen and raise you a year."  -- Jon, obviously corrupted in multiple ways, guessing the age of some girl in  urlLink Caesar's Palace .  Yeah, so it's been a while.  Don't think that I haven't wanted to get back to this.  I'm on the verge of taking my laptop to the emergency room tomorrow.  It won't even boot now.  It coughs and sputters, and just gives up.  To top off my computer woes, this computer crashed while downloading my pictures from the  urlLink Elph .  The Elph didn't like being caught in mid-transfer like that, so it deleted half of my pics just to spite me.  Don't worry, though.  I'll have my revenge.  In the meantime, you can believe that I'm going to be on the  urlLink Dell website  shopping for a cheap computer this week.  There's so much to say right now.  The good news is that I'm no longer a slave to the evil  urlLink conference .  The bad news is that I'm out a ton of money.  The funny part is that I only lost about $50 gambling.  Vegas is just expensive as H-E double hockey stick.  Regardless, I'm going to need to cool my jets for a while...which leaves plenty of time to write to my adoring fan.  So what have I been doing?  Let's see.  There was the conference,  urlLink night clubs ,  urlLink bars , gambling, old friends, new friends, Egyptians, books,  urlLink Blue Man Group , a  urlLink Tournament of Kings , the  urlLink Grand Canyon , shopping, and more books.  All in all, the trip was enough to stir more than my fair share of mixed emotions.  I'd love to write all about it right now, but my clock says it's almost 11:00p, my body says that it's almost 8:00p, and my mind is trying to get them to agree again.  So, alas, I am off to sleep.  Good night everybody!

      No news on the laptop.  I have one more 5.5 hour shift talking about our product to customers.  This wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have to stand for the entire duration.   The good news is that the lady arrives this evening.  This may interfere with "corporate night" at some resort, but it's worth it in my mind.  I might go ride some rollar coasters while I wait in eager anticipation.

      Well...I was just in the middle of writing a new blog detailing my life at the  urlLink conference  over the past couple of days when my laptop bit the big one.  I'm not sure just how bad it is, but I'm fairly certain that the monitor is gone.  My fingers are crossed for the hard drive though.  Everything is backed up, but I don't want to lose that blog.  I'll upload it as soon as I can.  Until then...check out this  urlLink sexy web site .

      I didn't get enough sleep last night.  Not that there's anything wrong with being tired, but I'm a touch embarrassed as to why I'm so sleepy right now.  I had to get up in the wee hours of the morning (yes, I consider 5:00am one of the wee hours) to catch my flight to Las Vegas.  Normally, this wouldn't be so bad, but this morning's trial was particularly taxing considering I was up until nearly 2:00am packing for this stupid trip.  I convinced myself that it was okay to stay up late packing.  I could always catch a nap on the plane, I said.  Do you think I slept?  Nope.  What kept me awake?  It seems silly, but, umm...Harry Potter did it.  Can you believe this?  I know I'm not always one to go against the norm for the sake of being different, but I never thought I'd stoop so low as to buy into a franchise like Harry Potter.  The mainstream bandwagon (or mindlessly media-driven cult as I like to call it) has lead me astray more than once in the past.  Consider this short list of purchasing mishaps: Marky Mark's second album, Titanic (the movie), and yes, even Star Wars Episodes I and II.  I know what you're saying.  How can I throw the heralded Star Wars franchise in with this group?  Trust me, I could go on and on about the corruption of one of the all-time great franchises - the subject for a later blog.  So yes, I admit it.  I have been bullied into consuming some of the worst media ever produced solely because it was popular (or so I thought at the time).  Maybe I was curious.  Maybe I was trying to fit in to something I didn't understand.  I'm not sure what was going through my head at the time, and immediately after buying my first Harry Potter book, I had to ask myself:  Have I been suckered yet again?  And them something quite remarkable occurred: I actually read the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  You know what?  It's really quite good.  It has humor, suspense, mystery, and drama all wrapped in the tale of a heroic child who represents everyone's fantasy - the "average" kid who is destined to do great things.  What's not to love about this?    Suddenly, this purchase isn't looking so bad.  The Sorcerer's Stone is light, short, succinct, and unassuming.  All welcome changes from the last book I read, Tom Clancy's Executive Orders.  Where Executive Orders is arrogant, Potter is humble.  Where Clancy brings the reader to the brink of political and social disaster, Rowlings gives us the purity of childhood.    Perfect!  This is just what I need at this juncture of my life.  Do you think I want a novel about hell bent terrorists or contrite politicians when I can read about hate in the Middle East, political unrest, or random shooting-sprees in the news every day?  No, I don't.  Reading Harry Potter is pure panacea - a child's story immersed in morality and sprinkled with heroism.  You can forget about your personal problems.  You can forget that the world is a tad unstable these days.  For a brief moment, there's nothing more important than escaping the clutches of Voldemort, or getting a passing grade in your "Defense Against the Dark Arts" course.  No, buying in to the Harry Potter franchise was not a bad decision on my part.  Perhaps waiting so long to do so was.

      " You're so money, and you don't even know it. " -- Trent,  urlLink Swingers   We're looking at less than twelve hours before I  urlLink leave  for the sin city (not to be confused with  urlLink Vice City ), a land of harsh neon lights,  urlLink extreme (dry) heat , and fabulously overdone  urlLink luxory .  You'd think I'd be excited about my first trip to Las Vegas, but I'm not.  Why?  Mostly because I know that this is just a change in venue for my toil.  I almost envy my teammates who get to stay behind and "support" our efforts at the conference.  On the other hand, I  will  be in Vegas after all.  And despite the fact that I'll probably have to work a few 14 hour days, I have a feeling that my friends and I will somehow find a way to squeeze some  urlLink gaming  into our schedules.  AND,  urlLink the conference  will be over on Thursday, which just happens to be the day after Rachael arrives.  PLUS, there is a light at the end of the tunnel with the product itself: we somehow talked the QA engineers into letting us release a beta version to a few clients.  So it looks like the conference truly will be the hump we've all been waiting to get over.  " Vegas baby, Vegas. " -- Trent

       "Hey, I know everybody's coming back to take stock of their lives.  You know what I say?  Leave your livestock alone."   -- Debbie,  urlLink Grosse Pointe Blank .   Well, you know what I say?  I've got some life stocking to do.  Here I am, on the verge of my big trip to fabulous  urlLink Las Vegas , yet I can't help but feel down.  Why?  It's quite simple, actually.  There are too many parts of my life that are pulling me in opposite directions.  Here's a sample in no particular order:       1.) My current work -- I won't lie.  It's kicking my ass right now.      2.) My girlfriend -- I won't lie.  She's really bidding for the rock right now.      3.) My family -- I see them maybe twice a year.  Three times, tops.      4.) My career ambitions -- A bit muddled right now.      5.) Money -- There never seems to be enough to go around.      6.) My friends -- &lt;Chandler Bing&gt;Could they  be  any more geographically dispersed right now?&lt;/Chandler Bing&gt;  As you might imagine, more than just a few of these issues are in direct opposition of each other.  You wanna talk about the job?  Okay, let's talk about the job.  The job is killing me.  I lead a group of three (myself included), which is supposed to do the work of about 20.  If you do the math, that's roughly seven jobs per person.  And they're not even seven of the same job.  Oh, no.  I'm the manager, the analyst, the architect, the product carrier, the support guy, etc, etc.  Our company wants the world without committing resources.  A brief discussion with my boss this afternoon yielded an interesting nugget: The company, realizing that my team is severly under-staffed, has decided to commit off-shore resources to the project "soon."  What does this mean?  Well, it probably means that they are going to hire people from China or India, who cost about one third the price of hiring people to do the same work here in the US at twice the management cost minus a fifty percent hit in performance as we get the new people up to speed.  It all comes out in the wash.  You may be saying, "So what?  Companies do that sort of thing all the time."  Well, I've recently put myself in a rather awkward position.  A couple of weeks ago, I told my boss that I was interested in moving to Northern Virginia.  Why Northern Virginia?  A few reasons:       a.) Said girlfriend lives there,      2.) Living in Northern Virginia places me within range of my parents (4 hours driving or so), and      d.) Northern Virginia is the epicenter of two career options that are weighing heavy on my mind.  Now things start to take shape.  So we have a girlfriend in VA, unwilling to move.  We have a steady income stream in New York.  We have the family, which we never see.  We have friends and business contacts who we shouldn't leave.  School and starting a business with old college pals beckons from the Commonwealth.  The Empire State has, well, it has stability.  What's a guy to do?  Punt.  Debbie-  "So what's your business?"   Martin-  "Professional killer."   Debbie-  "You get dental with that?"    Yeah.

        WARNING: Plot spoilers follow ***    I finished  urlLink Tom Clancy's "Executive Orders"  on the  urlLink train  back from DC last night.  This has been quite a long read for me, considering that I was forced to put it down thanks to current events.  I'm one to find an escape in novels, and I can't say that Tom Clancy took me away from the "real" war in Iraq.  Despite taking a three-month break, I have to say that the quote on the book's spine doesn't lie.  "A colossal read," the   urlLink Los Angeles Times   proclaims.  I think  long-winded  and  repetitive  more aptly describe the novel.  I'm not sure, but I think this was the same book as " urlLink Debt of Honor ," Clancy's last "colossal read," with the American flag on the cover instead of that of Japan.  All in all, I have to say that I found this novel to be wholly unsatisfying.  If you don't know the back-story to this novel, here's a quick reference.  At the end of "Debt of Honor," the protagonist, Jack Ryan, becomes the President of the United States after a wacko Japanese airline pilot decides to fly his Boeing 747 into the Capitol building during a joint session of congress.  Ryan, who was just sworn into the Vice President's office (recently vacated after the former VP has to step down for womanizing), his wife and kids, and a handful of secret service agents are the only people to survive.  Convenient.  "Executive Orders" picks up with Jack Ryan at the head of a largely empty US government.  Reluctantly, he tries to do the right thing, rebuilding the government from scratch while fending off various internal and external attacks.  Essentially, Clancy leads the reader on for about 1200 pages of twisting and turning plot lines that all involve independent factions who want to destroy Jack Ryan's presidency, and the United States along with it.  The reader has to wonder if it is actually possible for one person to have to deal with so much drama, even if he is the President of the most powerful nation in the world.  Listen to this (probably abridged) list of conflicts:  * The former Vice President decides that he didn't really resign, and therefore challenges Ryan for the Presidency both politically and through dirty smear tactics in the media. * The Iranian shah somehow assassinates the President of Iraq and forms a new United Islamic Republic. * People plot to kill Ryan's daughter. * Iranians plot to release Ebola all over the United States * Iran threatens to invade Saudi Arabia and Kuwait * India threatens to wage naval war if the US sends their ships through the Indian Ocean * China shoots down a passenger jet and then pretends that Taiwan did it * Two militiamen from Montana build a bomb and plot to blow up the White House * Iran manages to get an assassin in the secret service  If the lunacy of one man dealing with all of this isn't enough to turn you away, consider the resolutions to all of these problems.  After around 1200 pages of reading, maybe two of the problems have gone away.  Then, in two hundred dominating pages, the US, lead heroically by Jack Ryan, wipe all of these problems out with their smart bombs and superiorly trained army with practically no loss.  The book ends with Ryan showing a smart bomb dropping on the Iranian leader's house.  How nice.    If only the real world were so clean.  Several months after our real smart bombs and superiorly trained army dominated the overmatched Iraqi army, we can't go a day without hearing about some Iraqi ambush that ends with US casualties (usually deaths).  If only we could have dropped one bomb on Baghdad, said this wasn't about religion, wiped our hands and become good trading partners with Iraq.  Unfortunately, life doesn't work that way, which is something the diplomats should consider before throwing their hands up in the air and giving up.

        UVA 27 -- Dook 0    Ah, the blissfulness of my old stomping grounds -- the  urlLink University of Virginia .  My how things have changed in the two years since we parted ways.  The grounds (that's campus for those of you who are not  urlLink Wahoo afficianados ) is mostly covered with horrendously ugly red walls, each hiding some sort of new University construction project.  I arrived about three hours prior to game time in hopes of soaking up the pre-game culture for the very first time as an alumnus.  A stroll from the University Hall parking lot to the corner via Lambeth, Beta Bridge, and the Collonades revealed two University icons on their way out the door.  The new basketball arena has broken ground, with the construction project occupying an entire half of the U-Hall parking lots -- bummer for the first years (freshmen).  Also on its way out is the Lambeth scamper...no longer will the students have to play  urlLink frogger  while crossing Emmet street to get to their cars; a walkway over the road is under construction.  Passing down Rugby road and into the Corner area we were reminded of being an undergraduate at UVA.  Dressing up for football games is a popular tradition, and the students were looking fantastic.   urlLink Mincer's  was packed.  We fought our way through the crowd and picked out some t-shirts.  Mine is bright orange with Virginia written across the chest in Navy letters.  We concluded our Corner tour with a pizza from  urlLink Mellow Mushroom  and some ponchos from the Student Bookstore (a wise purchase).  From the corner we walked to the football stadium.  The Rotunda, the Lawn, the Ampitheater, and finally the  urlLink Engineering school ...Mr. Jefferson's finest all passed before Scott Stadium loomed large in our view.  A finer collegiate stadium I have not encountered, though I am obviously biased.  We entered through a gate that did not require swiping a student  ID for the first time ever, and after collecting our thunder sticks, we settled in, four rows from the top of the stadium, for the time of our lives.  Four quarters, 27 points, several electrifying plays, one rainy spot, and one injured " urlLink heisman candidate " later, we departed the stadium happy fans (despite the injury), and headed for the Theta Tau house.  Thanks to a record number of people at the game, traffic wasn't moving, so we decided to head to Buddist Biker for a drink or two.  We walked to the car in the pouring rain, and if that wasn't fun enough, we got within a block of the car before we realized that our keys were still at the house.  So we trudged back to the house (in the rain).  Thankfully, one of my fellow Theta Tau alum was willing to give us a ride back to the car.  We left Charlottesville around 12:30a and managed to be in bed by 2:15a.  Ahhhhh....

      Is it just me, or is the entire universe consipiring to beat me into the ground?  I've managed to keep my head up, but that just gives them an easier target, I think.  Right now, the gods are hurling hail stones at me.  Well, I haven't really seen any hail stones, but I've been told by "trustworthy"  urlLink sources  that they're on the way.  I'm supposed to be away from windows in the lowest level of my house right now.  Instead, I've opted for a cubicle on the second floor of my office building with a great view of this storm.  Mother nature's really taking it to the parking lot.  She's giving it a right good thrashing.  But she's not going to get me.  Oh, no.  In less than 17 hours, I'll be on my way to the beach for a nice vacation.  Oh yeah.

       "The first amendment is here to protect religion, not to protect us  from  religion."  -- Some guy on CNBC protesting the removal of the ten commandments tablets from a Birmingham, Alabama state court house.  On August 23rd,  urlLink Chief Justice Roy Moore  was removed from his seat on the Alabama Supreme Court for deliberately disobeying a court order to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments from the state judicial building.  Now, every school kid learns that one essential tenant of the US form of government is separation of church and state.  But what exactly does this mean?  The  urlLink first amendment  states, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."  So the man on CNBC was partially right; in their usual shifty wording, the founding fathers were attempting to restrict the government’s ability to tread on citizens' religious freedom in two ways.  First, they believed that there should be no government sponsored religion such as the Church of England.  Second, they wanted to make sure the government would not restrict anyone's freedom to practice religion.  Unfortunately (and contrary to what Justice Moore's supporters might state), it is clear that the court ruling to remove the statue violates neither condition set forth by the first amendment.  Removal of the statue does not constitute the establishment or prohibition of religion.  It merely means that no religion may be practiced in the state owned court house.  If the statue were left in place however, the state could be viewed as condoning one particular religion, which in fact, it is.  This was the opinion passed by a federal district court judge who ordered the statue removed.  Moore disagreed with this decision, but was denied an appeal by both the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court.  Out of legal options (or so he thought), Moore decided to disobey the ruling and left the statue in the court house rotunda.  This type of disobedience is not new to Chief Justice Moore.  He has a  urlLink history  of clashes regarding the ten commandments -- so many, in fact, that he was known as the "Ten Commandments Judge" even before this event boiled over.  Raised to believe that Christianity is the foundation of the entire government and its laws, Moore has consistantly refused to separate church and state and in doing so has broken the law.  Moore seems to have some delusion that he is standing up to an oppressive law,  urlLink as if he were Dr. Martin Luther King .    No, Justice Moore, you are no Dr. King.  Moore may have some sort of morale case here, but he is in no position to argue.  He must uphold the law, no matter how much he may personally disagree.  We need judges who do not uphold the law as much as we need airport security screeners to fall asleep on the job.  Chief Justice Moore has blatantly refused to accept the decision of superior courts, which lead to his fellow Supreme Court justices' unanimous decision to suspend him.  Those justices should carry forth and fully dismiss Moore.  He does not belong in our justice system.  This is not a question of whether or not the statue should be allowed in the Birmingham court house.  This is not a question about whether or not the U.S. government is indoctrinated by God.  This is about Chief Justice Roy Moore's history of disobeying court orders and his outright refusal to stand down in the face of the highest law of the land.  He has broken his oath to serve as a judge, and for that he should be permanently removed from his position on the Alabama Supreme Court.

      Worst weekend ever...  But let's not dwell on that fact.  Wednesday is Saturday and I'll be in Hilton Head, South Carolina splashing around and trying to even out this horrid farmer's tan that's left over from fishing last weekend.  Beaches tend to make all your problems melt away if you'll let them, and I'm more than willing right now.  I've spent the past month trying to rid myself of one problem in particular: the fact that I drive down to Virginia at least twice a month.  I've estimated that I spend approximately $5000 a year traveling between here and VA.  So, considering that my family and my girlfriend are in Virginia, and the fact that my company has an office there, I put in for a transfer.  My boss has been pretty understanding.  I really don't think he wants me to go.  He's tried in several subtle ways to convince me that I want to stay in NY.  I've been steadfast though, so he's tried to help me get approval to move.  Unfortunately, the approval process passes over the desk of my boss' boss, which is not a good thing.  He seems intent on stopping any type of request, whether it be for a laptop battery or for a move, and I don't expect this request to proceed any differently.  I threw myself into the move yesterday, though.  I moved the majority of my "stuff" down to VA last night.  I DO NOT want to EVER do that again (if I can help it).  Moving sucks -- thoroughly.  I kept my essentials up in a room that I'm renting in NY, but I anticipate moving to VA as soon as possible.  When will that be though?  The majority of my stress aside, I have two days of working out of the Herndon, Va office.  I'm heading to the beach the day after tomorrow and then it's back for the UVA versus DOOK game on Saturday night in Charlottesville (I got season tickets).  It's a packed schedule, but I think it'll be worth it.

      Why are Americans fat?  Ralf in Germany summed it up best when I visited last summer.  He offered me a cup of coffee and immediately followed up with sugar.  "I know you Americans like everything sweet," he said.  Yes.  Yes, that is true.  "We Americans"  love  sweet things.  And whatever is not sweet, we make sweet.   We are a society of excess and waste; Gluttony is our national pastime.   We build out, not up.  We have plenty of space for garbage dumps, so we don't bother recycling.  We have power bars.  We have oxygen bars.  We have Sams Club.  We have saccharin.  We even have pets too fat to play fetch.  We have too much of a good thing.  We have too much of everything, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.  Would you?

      I had planned on going to the gym this afternoon (roughly 5-ish), but I was side-tracked when our "specification by committee" meeting turned into a bash-session directed at my team.  I tried to take it in stride, but it's hard to not take things personally when you have a group of ten people spitting at the result of two years of hard work.  I think I did okay.  I joked; I joined in the bashing.  I think my ego may be bruised, though.  How can I tell if my ego is bruised?  Am I going to turn purple somewhere?  You know what the best part is?  We have two more scheduled ego-bruising sessions on the horizon...I can't wait.  In the meantime, I plan on taking my car to be serviced and then it's home to continue my packing / apartment search.

      I managed to fit the audit in to our allotted time despite a plethera of complaints on my part regarding the Quality Management processes.  In addition to that meeting, I've also managed to eat lunch, arrange for a ride to the BMW dealer after work, and took a training course in "Mutual Respect."    The training was the best part.  Basically, it tried to get the point across that you shouldn't be an a$$hole at work.  Duh.  The funny part is that my team seems to break just about every rule in the book (as far as ethnic jokes are concerned), yet I think we're one of the closest knit groups in the company.  We have one girl from Ukraine, a guy from Russia, a Greek guy, one guy from Hong Kong, one from India, one who's half white, half Chinese, one fully Chinese guy, one black guy, and one white American guy, all managed by a guy from India.  It doesn't get much more United Nations than that.  But it's good, and we have fun with it.  We experience and share each other's cultures as much as possible, and I think we work much better as a unit because of it.  Okay, back to the doomsday meeting...

      Ugh.  This meeting has just re-enforced a thought I that came to me earlier this morning:  Specification by committee does not work.   Specification is very, very important, true.  But when you try to determine what a product should do in a group discussion, things don't work out.  Here's why:     Experts are rare.   It's entirely unlikely that you will be able to gather a group of experts in the field that your product addresses.   There is no BEST solution.   Even if there was a "best solution," the metrics required to accurately measure the differences between solutions does not exist.   Group discussions among non-experts go nowhere.   This wastes time.  It's true that your specification period should consume a large portion of your development cycle, but not ALL OF IT! So what's the solution?  Specification by mandate.  You should have one or two people who are experts in your product's field.  They should know the market, what users you are trying to address, and where your product falls in with your company's other products.  With this in mind, the expert should develop the product specifications, run them through some sort of approval process, and then hand them to the developers for implementation.    Okay, lunch at my cubicle now.  Meeting with the QMS Auditors in five minutes, and then back to the doomsday meeting at 3:30p.  Cheers!

      Much better.  I spent the majority of hour two reworking a piece of legacy code.  It's a servlet with a lot of bloat.  I cut out the fat, removed all the "magic numbers," added JavaDoc comments, and targeted components for a later move to a common utility class.  Ahh, that was satisfying.  Now it's time to prepare for the doomsday meeting in thirty minutes.

      Okay.  Following a brisk and pleasant twenty minute drive (gorgeous weather this morning -- 68F and sunny!), I arrived at work around 8:10a this morning.  That's pretty good for me lately.  I don't think I made it in before 9:30a one day last week.  It's now 9:10a.  Let's take a look at my morning accomplishments:    Made coffee and consumed one (1) cup from my bright orange UVA mug... urlLink go HOOS !!  Checked personal e-mail hoping for first piece of fan mail.  Disappointed by lack of fan mail, but managed to forward one e-mail...  Read news  urlLink article  about new calculator feature in  urlLink google .  Played with new calculator feature in google.  Checked work e-mail.  Accepted invitation to seven hour long discussion about what we can add to our product to make it sellable in the next two weeks.  Not going to be a pleasant one...  Bathroom break...  Added items to Outlook about my  urlLink vacation  next week.  Consumed second cup of coffee.  Started weblog about my day. Wow.  Not going too well.  Let's try to pick up the productivity level, shall we?

      Today, I am going to perform an experiment.  I'm looking over at the girl who sits across the isle from me, and I'm wondering: How good can she be at her job that she remains employed despite working approximately one (1) hour a day?  I mean, she's here for a good seven hours a day, but I'm estimating that she only works for one (and it's definitely not a contiguous hour).    This made me think.  How effective am I during the day?  Naturally, I'd tell you that I put in a solid eight hours day in and day out, but I'd be lying.  So, I'm going to put it to blogger.  Blogger will be my independent consultant who will measure my effectiveness.  Let's begin...

      No really, he is.  You know the one -- from  urlLink Green Acres ?  Nevermind, but while we're on the subject of  urlLink Arnolds , let's talk a little bit about this California recall vote.  &lt;Dr. Evil&gt;Honestly people, how is this not a slap in the face of democracy everywhere?&lt;/Dr. Evil&gt;  If you don't know the back story,  urlLink Gray Davis , the current sitting governor of California is under fire.  Despite being elected to office twice (most recently in the 2002 election), Davis' opponents were unhappy enough to circulate a petition requesting a recall vote.  They obtained over 1.6 million signatures, so we now get to watch a highly rediculous election this coming October.  Now, California does not have an official impeachment procedure.  Actually, I guess you can call this current circus their version of an impeachment.  Basically, a very small minority of the registered voters can ask for a "do-over" if they are unhappy with the outcome of an election.  If you do the math, the 1.6 million signatures is less than 5% of the roughly 33 million people in the state ( urlLink according to 2000 US census data ).  Even worse than the fact that it only took 5% of the populate to recall Davis is what it takes for Davis to successfully defend his position; He  MUST  receive more than 50% of the vote to stay in office.  If he gets even a hair under 50%, even if he receives the  urlLink simple majority  of the vote, even if the next highest vote total is 5%, Gray Davis loses the election.  Now,  urlLink according to CNN , only 29% of the voters are willing to keep Davis in office.  The second highest vote total is 22%, garnered by Davis' Lieutenant Governor, Cruz Bustamante.  This doesn't bode well for Davis' career.  That's fine.  I don't necessarily understand all that has gone on in California during the past year.  I know that California's economy was heavily dependent on Tech Companies, and I'm sure that the tech burst hurt Silicon Valley and the overall California job market.  I also know they've had problems with energy and the environment.  I'm not here to defend Gray Davis as a politician.  I'm here to say that this recall procedure is nothing short of anti-democratic.  If this recall succeeds, and the current numbers suggest that it will, it will become a prime example of exactly what our founding fathers feared most: the overwhelming minority.  Assuredly,  urlLink Alexander Hamilton  was speaking of the operations of the Federal government when he wrote of "factions" (or special interest groups in modern terminology) in The  urlLink Federalist Papers  number  urlLink 10 .  In his paper, Hamilton describes two ways to control factions, or groups of people who are united under a common belief that is opposed to the well-being of the community at large.  You can either remove the causes for the faction or you can limit the damage it can do.  Hamilton elects for the latter because, "If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution."  Unfortunately, the current system of recall in the  urlLink State of California  does not allow for this.  It only takes 5% of the population to request the recall and doesn't even require a simple majority to remove the standing governor.  There's nothing wrong with removing a poorly performing governor.  There's nothing wrong with electing an action movie star to replace him.  There is something drastically wrong if a state allows a small minority to overrule what the majority has already decided.  That is anti-democratic, and anti-American.

      Today's music of choice is  urlLink MOS ' "The Chillout Session" Volumes  urlLink One  and  urlLink Two .  How can you go wrong with a set that starts off, "You give new meaning to the word delicious.  You're putting me in...OVERDRIVE!!"  Now _this_ is music to code by.  Or is that, "music by which to code?"  Who cares.    If you've never worked while listening to electronica, you are missing out on something special.  Electronica is the new classical music.  No words (unless we're talking Vocal Trance or something), just beats and melody.  You can get stuff to energize you, numb your mind, freak you out, or relax you.  Its your choice, but you'd be surprised how this music can help you harness in the good energy.  Harness energy, block bad.  Feel the flow.  It's circular...the flow... urlLink all good things .

      Hey!  How's the weather in your area?  We've got many a handsome looking thunderstorm prowling the island tonight.  This summer has been abysmally disappointing.  First it was cold until mid-May.  Then it rained for about two months straight.  Now I find myself a month from fall and wondering where the summer has gone.   Where are all the good summers dead: In the work, or in the bed?  Blah.

      I am a man with too much on my mind.  Maybe it's the mix of  urlLink driving fast ,  urlLink Paul Oakenfold , and reading the  urlLink Atlantic Monthly .  Maybe it's my relaxed state of mind.  I'm not sure of the source, but there are about a million thoughts buzzing through my head right now.  When I say a million, I'm only slightly exagerating.  There's everything from the lawn watering schedule to the sticky white rice at How May's to  urlLink Amtrak  going out of business to Tony Blair and " urlLink communitarianism " to the multi-national demographic that is the greater  urlLink Washington DC metro-area  to what Donald Duck is going to say next in  urlLink Kingdom Hearts ...  Craziness.  I have a  urlLink friend  whose eyes light up when I get this way.  He used to love to sit and watch me start my rapid fire idea engine.  It's his theory that I'm like this when I'm relaxed.  I tend to think he's right.  If that's the case, then I've been working too hard all my life.

      I was there in '03 when the great cable flap brought the whole Eastern Corridor to a screaching (okay, silent) halt.  That's right, I was sitting on a wonderfully spacious (okay, it was almost tomb-like)  urlLink Amtrak  train for six hours on Tuesday night.  Let me tell you, there's not much to look at on the south side of Newark New Jersey.  Why was I stuck on a south bound train, you ask?  Especially when I had just returned from Northern Virginia two nights prior?  Well, and I'm serious now, I had to go back to attend my girlfriend's grandfather's funeral.  It's really sad, actually.  We just visited him in the hospital on Sunday night, and he seemed fine.  It was a shock to everyone, including me.  So here I am, three days later, still in Northern Virginia.  I've learned a few things over the past few days.  Here's  a selection in no particular order:    I love my girl a whole lot.  Jewish funerals are extremely drawn out, extremely draining affairs.  New Jersey Transit sucks.   That is all.

      Jet set take two, go!  Tonight's destination is Indianapolis, Indiana.  For those of you who don't know where Indianapolis is (or even Indiana, for that matter), it's in the heart of this fine country -- snuggled just over the mountains, south of the lakes, and north of the equator.  You may be wondering why I might want to visit "Indian-apolis" (root, Native American city) -- there's nothing there but Colts and, well, what is there?  The answer is in your pocket.  Well, it might be.  Dig around for some loose change and see if you can find an  urlLink Indiana quarter .  Clear off the pocket lint and take a look on the non-George Washington side.  What's there?  A race car, that's right.  I'm going to go see some of the fastest automobiles on earth at the  urlLink US Grand Prix  this weekend.  This is the fourthUS Grand Prix to be held at the venerable  urlLink Indianapolis Speedway , and it also marks my fourth time attending.  If you're not familiar with  urlLink Formula One  cars, shame on you.  They are some of the most amazing machines on this planet, and largely drive the technology that you see in modern street cars today.  The fantastic part of this years trip is that it will be the first time the race will have meaning.  In the past two seasons, the driver's championship has been all but won before the cars even arrive in the states.  This year is different.  Only three points separate seventy-five time champion  urlLink Michael Schumacher  (he hasn't won that many times, I guess) and the up-and-coming superstar  urlLink Juan Pablo Montoya .  It's age and experience versus youth and enthusiasm.  Ice cold precision versus brash aggressiveness.   urlLink Ferrari  versus  urlLink BMW .  It's going to be great!  See you when I get back.

      Good evening, America.  I'm   urlLink Rusty Ventura  .  I'll be doing a guest column on  "they're already here"  from time to time.  I'd like to be able to promise you humor, tears, or thought-provoking insight, but unfortunately I'm an amateur so I can't guarantee quality.  With that said, we'll get right to this week's topic...   Friends   Relationships are indescribably complex, and they're built on emotions so of course they're going to be difficult.  But, as everyone knows they can be immensely satisfying (emphasis on "can").    The question I've been working over for the past month or so is how to treat friends and what to expect from them.  I think I have a lot of friends, or at least I used to.  Attending two colleges and serving as the social liaison for several university organizations presented me with a lot of opportunities to be both a coordinator and a participant in numerous parties, bar nights and excursions.     Unfortunately, as all graduates discover, no sooner than your student ID expires, you find emails and phone messages start getting replied to with a monthly lag, if at all.  Are these people still your friends?  Maybe they're just too busy settling, or maybe work tires them out and they can't stand to use a computer at night. Or maybe you're just not that important to them anymore.  No matter how much you try to rationalize things, you can't argue the fact that you're just not physically a part of their lives anymore.  You're probably miles and timezones apart, and most of what they see is a job and new people.  So feeling estranged in your new surroundings, you may try to make relations in your new surroundings.  Unfortunately, 99% of the people around you have been there for some time, so they probably already have a full cache of bar buddies, shopping pals and lovers.  If you work in a competitive industry, people of your age and class are probably battling fatigue from overwork as well, so they're even less inclined to go out and meet new folks.    Despite this, imagine you get lucky.  There's one or two people you find in a chat room or a special interest group.  Great!  You're no longer confined to your own moping for all non-working hours.  However, good relationships, like wine, take a while and can't be pestered into quicker results.  So even though you want to go out every weekend and bounce humorous banter back and forth in volleys of email, you'd best not smother your new friend lest you become a nuisance and better avoided.  In addition, people in your new town don't know you, so any kind of support you could get is going to be topical at best (if you're lucky enough not to scare people away in the process).  So what good _are_ friends anyway?  The old ones you laughed, bled and cried with now ignore you, and the new folks you meet have packed schedules and no foundation with you.  Being out there isn't easy, and it'll never be the way you've grown so used to.  What this means you have two choices: give up and stay a recluse, or keep on plugging and wait it out.  It'll take longer this time around because most people are settled and comfortable with their routine.  But if you stick it out and develop a strategy, you may just find what your heart is crying for so much.  I recommend the scattershot/blitzkrieg approach by signing up to a bunch of personals, carpet-bombing chat rooms, and scouring weeklies for special interest clubs, events and mixers.  This is may also be bolstered by frequent phone calls to mom.  So, the closest thing to a conclusion I've come to is that it takes time and effort, probably more than one is used to.  But, life is long, you are young, and there's a lot of personal discovery to be down in the meantime.  Perhaps a self-affirming ballad will help, so I'll leave you with the words of Paul Simon.  Take care, and stick it out!   A winter's day In a deep and dark December I am alone Gazing from my window to the streets below On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow I am a rock I am an island  I've built walls A fortress deep and mighty That none may penetrate I have no need of friendship Friendship causes pain It's laughter and it's loving I disdain I am a rock I am an island  Don't talk of love But I've heard the words before It's sleeping in my memory I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died If I never loved I never would have cried I am a rock I am an island  I have my books and my poetry to protect me I am shielded in my armor Hiding in my room safe within my womb I touch no one and no one touches me I am a rock I am an island  And a rock feels no pain And an island never cries   PS - If you're interested in more biochemical reactions by me, check out   urlLink Autumn Tactics  . ^^;;

      Last night I stumbled upon  Bowling for Columbine , a film I've been meaning to rent for some time now.  If you're not familiar with the Oscar winning film, it's essentially a documentary that follows   ULTRA  -liberal (note: I cannot emphasize the word ultra enough here) Michael Moore in his quest to determine why the United States has so many gun related homicides compared to the rest of the "civilized" world.  This is an interesting question to ponder.  The thesis put forth in the film is three-fold.  Firstly, there is an enormous number of guns readily available in our country.  Second, there is a pervasive fear that is constantly fed from all directions that creates an edginess amongst our citizens.  Third, there are fundamental break-downs in the social fabric of our nation, causing rifts in the family unit.  These rifts give reason and opportunity to those who wish to perpetrate gun-related crimes.  Personally, I find part two of the thesis to be the more intriguing part of the equation.  I've felt it myself: why are people so afraid of everything in this country?  I'm no psychologist, and I certainly have not performed any research in this area, but I can definitely go along with Marilyn Manson's comments in the film.  The government, mass media, and big business all want you afraid.  They want you to be afraid that the terrorists are going to kill your kids.  They want you to be afraid that if you don't get rid of your acne, you won't get married.  They want you to suspect your spouse of infidelity.  They want you to buy duct tape, sheets of plastic, teeth whitening strips, and a Lexus.  Fear motivates people to spend money and convinces them to allow others to act in an immoral fashion.   Fear is the lubricant of our great nation's empirical engine.   Why do they want us to be afraid?  What does our fear do for them?  Essentially, the government, mass media, and big business are not exempt from this fear.  They are equally afraid, but for different reasons.  You have to ask yourself, "Who has the power in this nation?"  Answer: rich white guys.  What strikes fear in the heart of a rich white guy?  Losing their power; their strangle-hold on the wealth and the ability to make the decisions in this country.  President Bush and his conglomerate of fear-mongerors are afraid that the United States will cease being the ultimate-super power they think (and I emphasize think) we are.  Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch, and the rest of the media giants are afraid that they will lose their grip on the public (and their pocketbooks).  Fear of losing power drives these men to a means to hold on -- by making sure that the general public lives in fear.  The worst part of the situation is the side-effects.  We have to be afraid of something.  So the media must pick someone to terrorize us: black men, Muslims, women, etc.  The United States, the supposed melting-pot of the world, cannot come together as one because the media divides us.  Whether consciously or not, mass-media drives the public's pre-conceived notions of other people.  Sadly, those notions are ones of fear -- not the type of emotion that glues a nation together.

      I just had the strange feeling that I should be wearing my seatbelt.  Yeah, I wish.  I wish I were in my  urlLink car  blasting down the highway to reach some spot where I can just leave it all behind -- some tranquil oasis where the ebb of existence slows to a standstill.  Instead I'm sitting in my cubicle being almost as effective as  urlLink Neo  after a night chasing the  urlLink White Rabbit .    I blame my current state on  urlLink my cell phone.   During the chaos that was my aborted move to the beautiful  urlLink commonwealth of Virginia  I managed to wash one last load of laundry before my departure.  That load of laundry happened to have a pair of cargo shorts in it, and in those cargo shorts was one (1) cell phone.  As you can probably imagine, cell phones don't take too kindly to the soap and water normally associated with the inside of a washing machine.  I just hope it didn't suffer.  After spitting and sputtering for a good week, my cell phone was suddenly resurrected from the dead.  The buttons didn't want to work as well, but I was happy.  My cell phone was working.  It kept working for a good week before the LCD panel started to fade.  Two days ago, I was unable to see a thing.  Obviously, this isn't going to work.  So I ordered a new cell phone today.  It's the  urlLink Sanyo 8100 , replete with all the bells and whistles.  It has a built in camera and my plan allows for all of those goodies I've been denying myself over the past two years: wireless web, wireless instant messaging, text messaging, oh my.  The only problem is that it doesn't arrive until Friday, which is much to long to make someone wait for such a toy.  So, in eager anticipation of my new play-thing, I have lost the ability to work.  You can understand why, can't you?

      There must be some overarching message that I'm missing here.  How is one supposed to properly balance all the rigorous demands of life with out letting one side dominate another?  Just consider all the complexities.  You need money to live, which generally requires work.  Of course you don't want to just work.  You want to work  for  something.  You have goals you want to reach.  You want to accomplish something; to leave your mark in this life.  Plant a tree.  Write a book.  Have a child.  Which is segway into even more complexities: Family life.  I think most would agree that there are certain internal desires that drive you to socialize.  Your acquaintances can take many forms.  You have friends who give you steady and morale guidance in this life.  You have family who can be the most treasured of all companions.  And you have romantic interests who can be the most emotionally demanding of the lot.  In between your external influences is yourself.  There are personal and spiritual endeavors which must be addressed in the coursing river of life.  Communing with higher forces, submersion in nature, and absorbing knowledge are significant aspects to knowing you -- to understanding who you are, why you are here, and where you want to go.    Understanding is the challenge of this.  Enlightenment lies in feeling how you want to prioritize these individual aspects.  I hesitate to say "individual" because they are not distinct.  They intermingle and bleed into one another.  You do business with friends.  Your job requires schooling.  You have crushes on your co-workers.  Time spent in one area is time lost in another.  It's an intricately complex matrix and solving the riddle is not easy.  So let's revisit the question.  How do you balance life?  Career, Friends, Spirituality.  What are the criteria to prioritize?  How do you keep your ambition from driving away your loved ones?  How do you keep your desire to be with the one you love from putting your career on hold?  How can you keep from losing touch with God when you can't get a moment to breathe?  Does anyone know the answers?  May I speak to her?

      Well they think a lot of things.  Why me alone I think because I am, I think because my Dad told me to, and I think because I'm paid a tidy sum of money to do so on a monthly basis.  However I  don't  think now is the time to acquiesce, for not thinking is exactly what other people thought wouldn't get them into trouble (and it did).  So if I have to decide whether being such a thinker is a blessing or a curse, I'd have to say I'll get back to you because I'd have to think it through.

      If life were like  urlLink Toy Story , todays toys would be considered nothing short of slaves.  As I slumped into my cubicle yesterday I was a bit perplexed to note two large packages on the floor next to my computers.  I opened the first -- a cheesy bag for my help in this years company conference.  I then shifted my attention to the large brown box with  urlLink Amazon.com and a smile  on the side.  I opened it hessitantly, but that couldn't surpress my shock.  Let me give you some background on this package:   Rusty:  Tell me you've already pre-ordered this!  [Referring to the newly released Unicron Transformer repleat with glowing eyes and fist]   Sword:  No, I'm waiting for somebody to give it to me as a gift.  ::hint, hint::  I was kidding at the time.  But when I opened that package there was none other than the planet consuming planet himself:  urlLink Unicron .  Thanks,  urlLink Rusty .  He's awesome.  He's the subject of many of my coworkers' jealousy -- I received more than one threat that he'd go missing if I left him alone...so I had to hire a baby (planet)-sitter while I was in meetings.  I guess toys like Unicron are the fruit of six years of friendship?  Just kidding.

      They Yankees are almost dead.  Oh, please let it happen again.  I know that's blasphemy coming from someone living in the shadow of Yankee stadium, but it's high time I let these feelings out.  Some of my finest baseball memories of late almost all involve the Yankees losing in October.  Watching Mariano Rivera's meltdown in game 7 of the 2001 World Series against the Diamondbacks tops the list.  Last year's loss to the rally monkey was fun, too.  This year the Yankees managed to beat one of my favorite teams, the Red Sox in the ALCS.  That was horrible.  I hate the Yankees.  I hate the fact that they have  all  of the good players.  I hate Derek Jeter's swagger.  I hate how Jorge Posada always gets the bloop hit to break his opponent's back.  I hate how Matsui only becomes Godzilla during the post-season.  I love how Enrique Wilson keeps making errors.  Now the Yankees are facing elimination from one of my former favorite teams, the Marlins.  I say former because I, like almost all Marlins fans, felt alienated when their championship team of 1997 was immediately dismantled to become the worst team in baseball.  I lived in Miami when they received the Marlins as an expansion team.  I followed them closely for four years.  Then they sold out...took the money and ran.    But now they're back from the dead, and about to beat the greatest dynasty in the history of modern sports...probably...well, maybe.  Oh, please.

      I went to see Kill Bill Volume 1 last night.  This movie is easily the most violent film I have ever seen.  In fact, I cannot summon the words necessary to adequately describe the outrageous carnage this film leaves in its wake.  Uma Thurman -- not my favorite actress -- can play a pretty mean woman with a vendetta.  But then again, wouldn't you be pissed if you were beaten senseless and shot in the head by your good friends on your wedding day?  Yeah, I thought you would.  Somehow she survives the ordeal, losing her baby in the process (yes, she was pregnant) and upon waking from a coma, decides to kill every one of her former death squad comrades.  All quite logical.  Tarrentino somehow manages to throw in a little art here and there.  Actually, the movie itself makes for more entertainment than what the movie is actually about, if that makes sense.  The visuals, sets, fight scenes and music are all amazing.  This movie, as you might expect from Tarrentino, manages to include Kung Fu, Japanese anime, cool music, stylish clothes, and time play into a montage of blood and guts.  The fight scene between Thurman and uber-cute-in-a-domineering-sort-of-way Lucy Liu was particularly dramatic for its stark contrast between the serenity of a Japanese garden covered in newly fallen snow and the ultra-violence which transpires within it.  In short, if you can stand a heavy dose of maiming and killing mixed in with large amounts of spurting guts and blood, I highly recommend the film.  If you are easily disturbed at the sight of people losing limbs, stay away.  Thank you, I'm here all week.

      Good grief, Charlie Brown.  I can't seem to shake the weekend from my body.  Isn't this backwards?  Aren't I supposed to recover from the week on the weekends, not vice versa?  Even at mid-day, my eyes are still drooping, swollen with the joy of living another weekend.    I fought tooth and nail to get off this island at a decent time on Friday.  It didn't work quite the way I planned, but I managed to arrive in VA around 9:00p.  This allowed plenty of time for the corruption of Disney through our invention of the Emperor's New Groove drinking game.  Fully 1/3 of a case of Bud Light later, sleep forced itself upon me.  Damn "llama" rule.  Saturday was devoted to UVA football.  My girlfriend and I arrived in Charlottesville in time to see our beloved Wahoos fight gallantly in a 19-14 loss.  We should have won.  Damn Seminoles.  The drive from VA to NY was a quick and smooth 4.5 hours last night, despite three leisurely stops along the way.  Traffic was pristine, and the batmobile hungrily devoured the open roads.  Yeah, even FSU couldn't rain on my parade (although that was highly disappointing).  I hate to see my girl cry, but when she is shedding tears at my departure I know that all is well again in that department.  ...and the peasants rejoice.

      Scott Granneman raises some excellent points in  urlLink this article, yet I feel he is missing some fundamental points.    First off, let me say that there is no debate that Windows security is a disaster.  Buy why is it a disaster?  Is it because the guys working up at  urlLink Microsoft  are idiots?   NO!!   The engineers who work at Microsoft are some of the most intelligent people in the business.  I'm tired of people acting as if Microsoft is stupid for creating all these problems in their software.  I'll tell you why they're there:  1.) Microsoft is in the business of making money.  This fact alone should give you a good idea how the Microsoft culture is different from that of the Linux community.  Linux is free.  Linux is built as a gift to the world.  Windows is built to make Bill Gates a ton of money.  2.) Microsoft is market driven.  Granneman stated this himself.  Microsoft makes decisions based on what marketing thinks will sell.  See point 1.  3.) One major marketing goal is to make the Windows operating system easy to use.  This always adds complexity that will, without a doubt, introduce bugs.  Some of those bugs will be security vulnerabilities.  Linux is not easy to use, which therefore costs its users more money to install and run, which therefore causes customers to purchase Windows, which therefore gives Microsoft a monopoly in the market.  Microsoft does not need to stop interconnecting its components.  Microsoft does not need to stop selling so many copies of their software.  Microsoft does need to inforce some security principles such as not executing files unless the user explicitly requests it...Such as fixing key common components such as Internet Explorer...or encouraging users to run with ordinary privledges.

      I'm broken.  The infamous "maybe we should see other people" idea was tossed around last night.  As you can imagine, it was pretty crushing.  At least I was crushed because it was of course not _my_ idea.  It was my partner's idea.  I've pretty much resigned myself to the end now.  I feel alone.  I still have a girlfriend, but I know that the relationship is on its death bed.  It's only a matter of time.    Of course, I've sensed this day coming for a while now.  Thus, Sunken Fog.  I was desperate to save the relationship.  Despite two years of separation, I still felt that it was right and that she was the one.  The one with whom I want to start a family.  The one with whom I wish to share everything.  There is a shread of light peeking through the door frame...there is hope.  I've boiled the situation down to two fundamental questions:  1.) Do we still love each other? and 2.) Are our lives compatible enough for this to work?  The answer to question number one will hopefully be answered this coming weekend.  She and I are going to spend a three day weekend in upstate NY -- exploring each other (Do I still know this person?), exploring ourselves (Am I being fair and honest with myself and where I want to go in life?).  Answer number two, unfortunately, is all but answered.  She is an ambitious, snobby, and sometimes selfish person.  I can say these things because she herself has said them to me.  The problem is that we are young.  And neither of us is really willing to allow our career ambitions to become subservient to the other's.  This is a problem.  I can't move down to VA unless I know that we can make our careers work together, and it's looking more and more like it's not going to happen.  At least, it looks like she's not willing to make it happen.  There's no compromise.  I am willing to make sacrifices to a certain degree.  She is not willing to sacrifice a thing.  So I have my doubts (serious doubts).   The saga continues...

      I'm not sure what it is, but I'm more and more getting this sneaking feeling, this hint of something in the pit of my stomach.  It's not a good feeling at all.  I'm not sure what it is, but I just don't feel like things are working out between me and my girl.  This is despite the fact that we always have good conversations on the phone, we don't really fight, and I yearn to be with her every day.  I just feel like my situation with my job is going to strangle this relationship until the two of us have grown so far apart that there's nothing to salvage.     ***  Background for the common reader (don't snicker).  I live in NY.  My girl lives in VA.  I requested a move to VA to be with her, but that was denied.  Instead, they promoted me.  So I'm stuck, and I'm miserable without her.  ***   Upkeep of the relationship is hard.  We try to talk every day, but our busy lives keep one or the other from the phone during normal hours (before 11:00p).  Lately it's been small things that have made me think twice about whether or not we're meant to be.  For instance, I went to bed around 1:30a last night.  She called me at 2:30a, complaining about not being able to sleep.  I woke up at 8:30a, rolled into work around 9:15a and called my girlfriend.  Somehow, she still managed to get up at 6:00a and in to work by 8:00a.  How does she do that?  Is it bad that I need so much sleep and she so little?  Am I going to end up being an anchor for her when she wants to go dancing until late in the night and I'm too tired to go?  To battle these feelings, I've been trying to lead a life of self-improvement.  I've been watching my diet, running, lifting weights.  I've been considering getting braces again, maybe whitening my teeth (my teeth run a close second to my feet and ankles for most beat-up body part -- another story).  I've been reading a lot, studying and thinking.  I've been improving my relationships with friends here in NY -- socializing more.  This war I've been waging has a two-pronged effect on my life.  First, it keeps me sane by making me feel better about myself.  Second, I feel it makes me more appealing to the woman in my life.    This is the maddening part.  I know she is the one for me.  I love her with all I have, all that I am.  But I have these doubts...these feelings that she doesn't really care about it any more.  She's resigned herself to  fatalism; "What will happen will happen," she said.  That's crap.  I know what I want.  I just need to find a way to get it.  I know that relationships are hard work, especially long distance relationships.  And I'm willing to work hard, to make this work.  It must work.  It's just that...  I'm so far away.  The strain this distance puts on me is getting to be too much.  I don't know what to do.  My job won't let me move.  The only other option under my control is to quit, which would be suicide for my career considering my recent promotion.  I'd probably have to start over.  So, I've been backed into a corner so to speak.  I now have three options:   1.) Convince her that she needs to come live in NY for a year or so or 2.) Get over it...learn to live with the mental strain or 3.) End it.  I'm going to scratch off number three because, well, that should be obvious.  So really I only have two options.  Option number one is tricky.  To convince her to move to NY is to convince her to take the biggest risk of her life: to leave all that definitely makes her happy (her family, her friends, her job, her home) and move in with the one she loves.  In my mind this is a no-brainer.  Not so in hers.  Option number two is equally tricky, but for different reasons.  No matter what I try, I cannot rationalize this situation.  I cannot convince myself that one more year is tolerable.  I cannot fool myself into thinking that things will just "work out" in a year; that things will be different and somehow better.  It's true I'm young.  I'm impatient.  I want this now.  It must work.  Always,

      Finally, now that the dust has settled from the debacle that was the ACC's summertime expansion, we can truly start to guess what will be the final outcome.  My take on the issue?  The ACC has screwed itself.  Look at the current state of ACC football plus its three incoming teams.  Of its original nine teams, it has one (that's one) in the top 25.  Granted, Florida State is third overall in the BCS standing, but who honestly thinks they belong there?  NC State, Maryland, and UVA have all had disappointing seasons this year, and the remaining five ACC schools are border-line pathetic.  Actually, Duke and UNC not only cross that line, but have redefined it with their abysmal play.  Miami and Virginia Tech even these standings out a bit, each landing in the top six of the BCS.  But are they are really the powerhouses that everyone expects to arrive next year.?  No.  They are not.  Witness West Virginia absolutely destroying Virginia Tech in all ways last Wednesday night (and I mean absolutely in every way).  Witness Virginia Tech crushing Miami.  Did either of these teams look like a top calibur team during those games?  No, they did not.  Neither had an offense to speak of.  Neither could keep from making stupid mistakes.  So we have these two new teams joining the conference next year with Boston College joining the next.  None of these three teams are the dominant programs which the ACC thought they were getting.  Florida State has been hanging on to their history by a thread the past few years, and I fully expect that thread to break once Bowden retires (and you know it's going to happen soon).  NC State, Maryland, and Virginia seem destined to remain mediocre at best.  Basically, the ACC is now just a much larger conference full of average teams.  The worst part of all this is that the ACC basically plucked the worst basketball teams from the Big East and watered down one of the better basketball conferences.  The Big East, meanwhile, has picked up four new basketball programs that will easily make it the best conference in the country.  So the ACC now has a big and average basketball conference and a big and average football conference.  Hmmm, I hope that conference championship game pays for all of these mistakes...

       urlLink This  is why we need a change.  The American software industry is going down the tubes, and there's nothing you or I can do about it.  Really, it's not a problem though.  I know that it's my lifeblood right now, but you can't fear these things.  The economy changes.  The country evolves.  It's happened before, and these forces will continue to erode this industry until it's completely left us for India and China.  Sure, you can fight it.  You can try to unionize and fight for your jobs to stay here in the US.  It's worked for steel workers, right?  Well, it depends on what you call working I suppose.  Personally, I don't want to constantly come to work distrusting my management.  I don't want to worry every day that they will find some loop hole that will allow them to eliminate my job in favor of five off shore workers.  That's just not a peaceful work environment in my mind.  So what choice do Americans in this situation have?  One, you can become your own boss and start a company where you won't worry about shipping jobs out of the country.  But how are you going to compete against those companies that  are  willing?  You can't.  Or, you can try to fight for what jobs are out there.  That doesn't sound too fun, either.  Can you imagine the pressure there will be for you to perform.  There are literally thousands of people out there who can do your job as well or better than you.  Your team will constantly be understaffed and you're going to have to interface with off-shore resources on a daily basis.  Again, this doesn't sound too pleasant.  Option three, my option, is to reinvent yourself.  You have to accept the fact that these things are going to happen.  Look forward to the future.  Predict.  Plan strategically.  Where will the industry be in five, ten, fifteen years?  What are you skills?  What skills do you need to be a part of the picture down the road?  What other industries seem to be on the rise?   Don't be afraid of change; it's going to happen.  There's very little you can control in this life.  Work on those things, and when it comes to whole industries, just make sure you have the right surf board to carry you to where you want to be.

      On a scale of 1 to F (we speak hex now), where 1 is a stubbed toe and F is a catastrophically dislocated and fractured ankle, I'd say that this one is an A.  It's not so bad that I need to spend a week in bed but it definitely gave me pause to consider giving up basketball.  I ask you, why do I have to turn my ankle so frequently?  Actually, why do I need to turn my ankle at all?  Yesterday would have been a good day if I hadn't a.) forgotten my inhalor and b.) sprained my ankle.  Today is looking up though.  I made it in to work "early," we have a brand meeting this morning in which I hope to hear good news about our progress, and tonight I'm going to see Return of the King.

      Here's a fun site:  urlLink Colley's Bias Free College Football Rankings .  Wes Colley is a professor of Astronomy at the  urlLink University of Virginia  ( urlLink Wahoowa!!! ) who runs one of the seven computer polls used in the BCS formula.  Thankfully, he has yet to be stoned to death (although my only evidence of this is the lack of newspaper stories -- maybe there's some coverup here?).  Try entering this series of "what-if's."  Add: UVA beats Clemson UVA beats Florida State UVA beats South Carolina Virginia Tech beats West Virginia Maryland beats Northern Ill  Remove: The opposite of the five games listed above.  The results?  UVA miraculously moves up from being ranked 42 to the number five slot!  Oh, what could have been.  But this web site introduces some interesting questions.  Is this system fair?  I've thought about this a lot over the past year or so.  My conclusion?  Who cares.  I'm not going to take  urlLink Stewart Mandel's  position that this is what makes college football what it is, but I will say that it makes for interesting lunch conversation with the boys.  I don't think schools (read any team not in the six BCS conferences) should be excluded from the system, but this is fun.  If the powers that be do decide to tweak the system, they need to preserve the number one reason why college football is the most fun game to watch:   Every game must be of the utmost importance.   Any change must maintain the fact that fans and players alike contemplate jumping from the seventh story of the campus library any time their team loses.  Of course, this causes a bit of a problem with the whole playoff idea.  While I like the idea that a playoff will almost always choose the most deserving champion, it has two flaws in my mind.  First, there must be a method for selecting the teams that will be in the playoff.  What are we going to use?  The BCS?  The human polls?  All flawed.  Second, you have to select enough teams to start the playoff as to make sure that all teams that have a remote possibility of winning the championship are included.  What is that number?  If it's greater than four then we have a problem, as that adds three or more games to the end of the already lengthy season.  So here is my simple four step plan for creating a (nearly) perfect college football system.  1.) Limit the regular season to 11 games, all against division 1-A teams.  Conference championships must be included in the 11 games.  2.) Set up a 16-team championship using the following rules.  One: There will be eight (8) automatic berths into the championship -- one from each of the BCS  conferences, one from the MAC, and one from Conference USA.  Two: There will be eight (8) at-large berths -- the top eight teams in the BCS to not receive an automatic berth.  3.) The first round of the championship will be the regular bowls.  The rest will be played at a later date.  4.) The team to win the tournament will be the undisputed national champion.  The key to making this work while preserving all that is good about college football is to make sure that every game matters.  Therefore, the BCS ranking system needs to weigh heavily on losses, especially in-conference losses.  This isn't a perfect proposal (I doubt it would make enough money to keep the bowl officals happy), and I'm sure I'll change my mind before I go to bed tonight, so check back tomorrow for my next brilliant idea.  Toodles.

      Okay, so I was using my badge as an excuse to sleep in every morning for the past week.  Now I have a new badge and I STILL slept in until 9:00am EST.  Oh well.  The great thing about living less than 1 mile (that's 1.609344 km for those of you on the metric system) from my office.  I can practically roll out of bed and be at my work station.  Heh, heh.  Work station.  I should just call it my "station."  Then, when there's an emergency, my boss can yell, "All hands to their stations!" and I can sprint from the kitchen back to my "station" to defuse the "situation."  Ah, to dream of a more exciting work day.    I don't  really  have a work station, per say.  Instead, it's more of a cubicle, lined with various corporate propoganda and miscellaneous toys I've received as gifts over the past 2.5 years.  There's the ubiquitous "magic" 8-ball, the model BMW 328Ci (far inferior to my  real  330Ci), the Ken Morrow bobble-head (don't worry, I don't know who he is, either) wearing the wooden elephant mask from India, a stuffed cow holding a football with a "Go CAVZ" sign around his neck, and the clock made from a baseball.  Wow, where did I get all this junk?  This isn't a work station.  This is a playstation.  I wish.  ::shrug::

      Well, it's more of a white badge of courage.  Isn't white kinda symbolic of fear, though?  You turn white when you see something that scares you a lot, right?  It's been a busy day, full of meetings with people who don't know up from down, forward from backward.  These are people who want me to deliver version 2.0 features for version 1.5 and 1.5 features for 2.0.  People who want me to cross the i's and dot the t's.  People who want me to walk on water and eat my cake too.  I think it's time to pass the buck.  I dropped by yonder security office on the way back from my daily exercise routine in hopes of replacing my lost ID badge.  Alas, I am now sitting at my computer, still without a badge.  The security folk are fighting off a serious bout of crashing camera drivers.  These aren't the drivers who take you to Winn Dixie to pick up a pound and a half of ham.  These are the drivers that tell your computer how to take pictures of my mug, and if you don't tell your computer exactly how to do something, well...you can imagine the problems.  So I'm still badgeless, and if they don't correct this problem in the next 15 minutes, I'm going to go crazy...Crazy?  I was crazy once...

       Virginia Tech to the ACC?  They didn't Mullet over very long.  -- Someone's sign at the VT vs. UVA football game on Saturday.  I have never in my life witnessed a sporting event that had a truly lasting impact on me.  That was until Saturday afternoon around, say, 4:00pm when Matt Schaub took a knee to end what turned out to be the  urlLink utter dismanteling  of the once proud Virginia Tech (c)Hokies.  Maybe it was all the turkey and stuffing.  Maybe it was hostile crowd.  Whatever it was, Virginia Tech looked completely confused as Virginia blitzed them from all directions in route to scoring four touchdowns on their first four possessions in second half.  And with chants of "Welcome to the ACC" pouring down from the stands, the Hokies were left to wonder why they can't win in the month of November.  You want to know what I think?  WHO CARES!!  The Commonwealth Cup is back in its rightful place: Charlottesville, VA.

      Try finding your Bill Murray...or at least a cute married girl, complete with full lips, clear skin, and a bad hair cut who can take you out for Karaoki, dancing, and drinking.   If you haven't seen it yet, go see  urlLink Lost in Translation.   It just won three  urlLink Golden Globes  on Sunday.    The film is about Bill Murray who plays a washed up actor by the name of Bob Harris who comes to Tokyo to endorse a Japanese whiskey company.  He's tired of his wife and he wants to be acting in plays rather than shooting commercials in a foreign country.  Staying in the same hotel is Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johansson), a recent graduate from Yale University, who is visiting Tokyo her newlywed husband who is town for a photo shoot (he's a photographer).  Charlotte is young, doesn't know what she wants to do with her life, and is quickly becoming overwhelmed with the complexities of married life.  Both Bob and Charlotte are miserable in Tokyo, and it's their misery that brings them together.  I'm not going to give any more plot details away.  Go see the movie.  It's artsy, and a little dark to be considered a comedy, but you'll be glad you saw it.  I promise.  Later.

      Hola.  I have some bad news, friends.  Well, it's not so much bad news as a setback of sorts.  My landlord told me that he could not run Internet access into my apartment today.  If you didn't know, I live in a basement apartment.  Aparently, my landlord's cable modem access is paid for by his company and they said no to the idea.  This is quite a bummer.  I was hoping to get my home PC back online so I can chat and read e-mail...maybe even surf the web for movie times or something.  I also wanted to install Linux and setup a web server on "Old Reliable," my Gateway PII 233MHz computer I bought before going to study at  urlLink The University .  I thought I could get my own domain name, set up my blog, put up a wiki for brain storming, maybe host my photos a little better than  urlLink Ofoto  can.  Alas, my dreams are dashed.    As I see it, I have three means of recourse.  First, I can use dial-up.  How 1995 can we get?  Plus I would need to get a phone line in my apartment, which costs $.  Second, I can try to get DSL.  Again, I believe this would require a phone line first, which costs even more $.  Third, and I hope I can pull this off, I can try to get another Cable Modem set up in the house.  I can have my landlord tell the cable company that he wants to set up a second cable modem for his own personal use...not sure if this will work.  No matter the scenario, this is going to cost me money that I don't want to pay.  I'm going to have to suck it up if I want access at home, though.  In the meantime, I've located two nearby  urlLink Starbucks  where I will be going to drink coffee and surf the web as necessary.  I'm going to need it if I want to research anything outside of work.  Bummer...maybe.

      This whole India experience has given me time to consider our current outsourcing problem.  Indian people here are constantly asking me if Americans are angry about it.  The sad part is that people really don’t realize that it’s happening.  At least they don’t understand the extent of the damage to our industry that has already occurred.  There are thousands and thousands of people working for US software industries in this one small city alone.  The worst part is going to be when people realize that there’s nothing they can do about it.  If you think the economic disparity in the US is bad, you should see this place.  I haven’t had the time to explore really, but just driving from my hotel to the office shows the highs and lows of living in India.  There are so many people in this city who live in rubble.  I mean, this is the filthiest of filthy as far as living standards are concerned.  These people live in huts that are basically a blanket hung over a wire.  And right next to these shanty towns are some of the nicest houses…houses that would go for millions of dollars in the US.  It’s amazing.  The paradox is almost comical.  These people live in absolute squalor.  Their front yards are just piles of dirt and broken stone, yet they spend a large part of the day sweeping their front porch.  It’s really sad.  But really, it’s this type of disparity that is the ultimate driving force behind the Indian take-over of the US software industry.  I was watching the news last night when a major executive was explaining the reasons why he has outsource several thousand computer jobs to India.  His primary reason was not cost, he said.  The primary reason was talent.  Yeah, right.  The primary reason is cost.  Don’t get me wrong.  These people have loads of talent, but consider how they live – what they see around them everyday.  There are billions of people in this country.  If you are going to be one of the people who is not living in a shanty barely able to find enough food, you’d better work hard and you’d better be good at what you do.  What else can motivate you more?  Sure, they’re only getting paid $10, $12K a year, but that’s way more than you need to get by here.  What drives the average US software person?  Money.  The software industry was a cash cow five years ago.  Companies could not find enough people.  Which do you think is going to drive a person to be better?  Cash, or survival?  There’s nothing more motivating than knowing you might die if you don’t succeed.  America stands no chance, and should just start moving toward re-training itself in newer technologies that cannot be so easily shipped off-shore.  It’s their only chance.

      I have arrived.  I know that most of you didn't even know I was going, but nevertheless: I am here and alive in Hyderabad, India.  Hyderabad is the location of my company's newest office building full of fifty of our newest star employees.  I'm here to train them on how to test and develop my product.  I should say one of my products, because I now manage two products.  The sister product in our product line has now fallen under my supervision also.  I'm happy about that, but that's the subject for another blog.  I departed NYC around 7:15pm on Thursday evening.  My flight took me through London, where we landed and deplaned at 6:00am local time.  This was a bit annoying because we were just going to get on the same plane to continue to Mumbai, but we had to get off with all of our luggage to allow them to change crews and clean up the place a bit.  After an hour of sitting in a lounge area which we were not allowed to leave and an hour of standing in line to get back on the plane, we were finally back in the air for the 8 hour trip to Mumbai.  This was followed by a three hour layover in Mumbai before my flight to Hyderabad.  I traveled on India Airlines for the entire trip over.  I honestly thought this would be the most miserable travel experience of my life.  My company had denied business class due to budget restraints so I was prepared for the worst.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the trip go by rather quickly.  I read and played Advance Wars and watched some movies.  The food was very good.  I'm a big fan of Indian food, and Indian Airlines did not disappoint.  I ate mostly vegetarian meals, which were quite delicious.    I met another American from the New York area in the Mumbai airport while waiting for my flight to Hyderabad.  It turned out that he too was a development manager for a small software company traveling to Hyderabad for training.  In contrast to my short stay, he will be here for a month.  When I told him that I work for CA, I was shocked that he knew our headquarters is located on Long Island.  It turns out that he attended Stonybrook University, which is practically right next door to our office building.  He started naming people he knows who work for my company and I happened to have dinner with the first person he named not two nights prior.  I am constantly amazed by how small this world is.  After an hour delay, we boarded our plane to Hyderabad.  I was shocked to see that this 55 minute domestic flight was being served by a Boeing 747.  I was half expecting a turbo-prop puddle jumper.  When I boarded, the first thing I noticed was that the entire first two sections were packed with Muslims.  It was a strange feeling being the only white American on the plane and getting dirty looks because of it.   I was very disappointed to find out that I felt negative feelings toward Muslims.  I guess it's not really Muslims in general, but people from this area scare me.  I don't know how the feel about Americans and I certainly don't want a problem because of it.  I need to reflect on this some more.  My flight arrived in Hyderabad around 3:30am.  Since I was sitting in row 78 or 84, I was naturally one of the last people off the plane.  We all had to go through immigration and customs, which took forever.  Somehow, I kept picking the slowest line available.  Amazingly, my driver was still waiting for me when I finally emmerged from the airport.  All of these events conspired to delay my arrival in the Taj Banjara until 4:30am where I was able to settle down and immediately fall asleep only to awaken for dinner around 6:30pm.  Almost immediately after I had awakened, my friend who also works for my company (in Tefen, Israel) called my room.  He wanted to let me know that the driver would pick me up in the morning and to ask if I wanted to have dinner.  Considering the fact that I will be largely alone for the remainder of my trip, I took him up on the offer.  We ventured out of the hotel to a North Indian restaurant up the road.    Our walk to the restaurant gave me my first taste of traffic in this city which is chaotic at best, but leans more toward deadlock during rush hour I hear.  It's not uncommon to be late for work due to a water-buffelo crossing.  There are no real rules for driving here it appears -- more guidelines than anything.  They of course drive on the left hand side of the road here, which is tough enough to get used to.  The best part is the fact that people really don't pay attention to lines on the road.  Or lanes for that matter.  People don't seem bothered when cars come the wrong way head on into traffic.  They have developed a system of honking that seems to keep everyone on the same page and prevents any serious accidents.  I'm looking forward to seeing how the system works at rush hour.

       urlLink Gay Marriage Debate Shifts to Small New York Township   Oh, jeah.  If you didn't already know, this country is staged for an epic battle.  I really mean it.  This place is a powder keg ready blow.  Bush and his associates have made for an amazingly charged political atmosphere.  It's hair raisingly exciting and terrifying at the same time.  You watch.  The shit is going to hit the fan and *pop!*  Gay Marriage The Middle East Corporate Ethics Affirmative Action Foreign Trade Homeland Security The Patriot Act State vs. Federal Governance Poverty  If you read the US Constitution, you'll find one very important issue that is conspicuously ignored: slavery.  The reason?  The founding fathers didn't think that the country was strong enough to survive the debate over what to do about the huge population living in bondage.  Sometimes you have to ignore an issue until all parties are ready to debate without trying to kill each other.    The issue of gay marriage, or gay rights in general, has come to a head.  We can't ignore it anymore.  In the red corner, we have the religious right who think homosexuality is morally wrong.  In the white corner we have those who believe that homosexuals are a true minority who are fighting descimination in the same way women & blacks have over this country's short history.  Soon the debate will be on.  Are homosexuals a viable minority?  Is marriage a human right of the life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness variety?  I'm looking forward to the outcome (mostly because I'm optimistic of the outcome), but I can't help but be weary of the consequences of a decision...  ::[WU TANG] The saga continues...

       In no fashion have I lost my passion for the pen. It's just that lately life has been a lot less inspirin'.  --  Simply Cee-Lo Green   I learn as I go.  I wish wisdom could be bottled and sold.  Can you imagine the price that would fetch?  I've found myself smack in the middle of a very important life lesson of late.  People are not always motivated by the obvious.  I'm not sure why my QA manager decided to search extensively for a reason that would prevent us from releasing our product to beta testers today.  I don't understand why my friend's girlfriend decided to stir things up between me and my fiance today.  Are people stupid, or are they working on some yet undiscovered set of logic?  I can understand idealism motivating someone.  I can understand being motivated by money and power.  Sometimes reality is what drives someone.  But I have to admit that I am totally at a loss when people make decisions that obviously hurt everybody and help nobody.  I suppose there are depressed people out there who just want to drag you down to their level.  They see you succeeding.  They see that you are happy and they want to be equal with you.  Instead of rising up, they can only drag you down.  But that can't possibly be the only answer.  Sometimes you just can't tell what drives a person.  That's scary.  Especially when that person has a lot of power.  Our QA team managed to hold the project hostage for over 72 hours.  It looks like we are good to go in the morning, but any more delay could have meant people's heads.  But the worst part is when the person just won't tell you why they do the things they do.  Then you're left to wonder, to guess, to speculate...and this only makes you paranoid.  Does this person have something against me?  Did I do something to piss this person off?  Is this person jealous?  Is he just setting me up to fail?  Is he using me to attack someone else?  That's the worst.  Am I a pawn in someone else's game?  I must be making some sort of basic fundamental assumption that is miguiding me in my analysis.  What am I assuming?  I assume that the person is mentally stable, and logical, and competent at what he or she does.  Maybe that's too much.  Because this implies that the reasoning behind any decision is rational, which is probably not the case.  I should let the torch shine on my own inner workings, though.  How stable am I right now?  I think I'm okay.  I'm a little stressed by this mess of a release at work.  :: [ASIDE]  Can you believe that this is the "good project" of the two products I'm managing? ::   If I'm stable, then what else can it be?  Is it that I just don't understand what's going on?  Is it over my head?  "If I'm reading this right, and I like to think that I am..."  It's more than possible.  I can't claim to be able to play the political game at the highest levels.  Let's be honest.  I am an unarmed, (not quite so) innocent bystander in those types of battles.  But these instances are not being played at a high level.  One situation involves a kooky girl who is desperate to get married and has a well documented history of pissing people off that's longer than my...well, let's just say it's long.  The other situation involves a minor player in his organization.  He also has a well known reputation for pissing people off in the same way.  So if it's not me...if other people have the same problems, then it must be them.  What makes them tick?  What makes them insist on ticking me off?  Will they ever let me in on their secret, or am I destined to never know.  That might kill me.  Now I wish I could drink a bottle of wisdom elixor and just understand.  I'm going to go check 7-11.

      When I say things like, "the whole software industry is crashing down around us," I'm only partially serious.  And by partially serious, I mean don't worry about it yet.  At least, don't worry about it the way some of my team members worry about it.  One girl on my team will shoot out of her cubicle and into a conversation faster than you can say "offshore outsourcing," which is the usual trigger for such an occurance.  People say that this emminent industry collapse is going to be much worse than any before it because it consists of losing white collar jobs.  In the past, you could at least tell blue collar workers that they could work "harder" and get a better education to spring into the IT industry.  Ppffft.  Work harder, you say?  What is harder than working heavy machinery for eight to ten hours a day?  More like, "work differently," I say.  And don't worry about the next big industry.  Why are you looking to be herded from one big industry to the next?  Do what you like, and good things will follow.  I (almost) promise.

      44,000 miles in 21 months does things to a man.  I love to drive.  Relaxing in the driver's seat, listening to  urlLink Oakenfold  or  urlLink Corsten , catching up with friends on the telephone.  Most people would despise the drive.  Most would resent putting this many miles on their car, this fast.  I don't mind, though.  I bought a driver's car, and drive it I will.  One unfortunate side-effect has been the exhaustion of my musical resources.  Quite frankly, I don't think I can listen to Oakenfold's Cream or Dave Ralph's Tranceport II again without forever revolting against the genre.  I keep forgetting that there's a lot more out there, though.  I definitely don't keep up on the industry like my friends do.  But I decided to do something about it this week.  This week, I refreshed my collection -- and I didn't just stick to Trance.  Here's the list in no particular order:  Tiesto - In Search of Sunrise 3 Tiesto - Nyana Thievery Corporation - The Richest Man in Babylon Outkast - The Love Below / Speakerboxxx Outkast - Aquemini Outkast - Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik Cee-Lo - Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections Goodie Mob - Still Standing    I'll let you know what I think once I've had time to listen, but early results are in and Tiesto's In Search of Sunrise 3 looks like an instant masterpiece.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Panel Says Mad Cow May Not Have Been Lame   Life in America is interrupt driven.  There was a time when I thought that it was just my company.  When a problem arises, let's take care of it.  I don't care that you're still working on the last problem.  But maybe this opinion was formed a little too early.  Maybe I was a little near sighted on this issue.  So I have shifted my gaze away from the grindstone to which my nose has been pressed for roughly three years to the beyond.  And lo, I have discovered that "my" problems extend far beyond my initial expectations.  In general, people do not realize that resources are always finite.  There is an infinite source or problems.  Infinity is greater than finiteness.  Therefore, only a subset of all problems may be addressed at any given time.  (I feel like I'm back in  urlLink professor Martin's  urlLink Discrete II class again...ugh.)  If you want your problems solved correctly, you need to give people the time to do so.  If you don't want the problems, then you need to let people plan.  And time spent planning is time spent not dealing with current problems.  But hopefully, this type of investment will pay off with less problems that need immediate attention.

      At this point, a powerful sigh from the gathering crowds of on-lookers would probably send me over the edge.  Even the best laid plans cannot hope to stand before the rampage that is executive management with a neat new toy.  In terms of revenue, we were on the right track.  We were a coiled snake ready to destroy our competition.  Then the stupid crocodile hunter came along and grabbed us by the neck in mid-flight.  Crikey!  When the executives start telling the engineers "how" to do something before they know "what" they want done, it's time to consider moving on.  And that's just what some of our key people have started to do.  Me?  I'll see how things play out over the next few weeks.  I still have faith that we can bring them to their senses.

      What is a good strategy for succeeding?  Is it better to try to do your best at all times, or is there benefit to letting someone else succeed and then reap their rewards?   urlLink Nonzero  talks about east versus west in the  urlLink industrial revolution .  Why didn't the industrial revolution start in the China instead of England and France?  Euro-centrist theory says that Europe was either better suited for the revolution due to proximity to resources (not really) or it was lucky (almost).  Interestingly, history shows us that China came very, very close to an industrial revolution.  Much earlier than Europe, in fact.  But they never made the leap into industrialization.  Why?    At the time, China was the place to be.  Europe was in second place.  China was developing technologies and their economy was booming (by their standards).  This naturally drew attention to them -- bad attention in the way of barbarian hordes who rampaged through the country, eventually subjugating them.  After 100 years of barbarian rule, the Chinese broke free, thus starting the Ming dynasty.  During the Ming dynasty, things changed for China.  They still had an imposing economy, but they changed their policies.  With barbarian rule fresh in their minds and still under threat of invasion, the Chinese stopped sea-born exploration.  They severely clamped down on free trade with foreign countries, banning many foreign goods.  Essentially, they developed a very isolationist policy -- investments in  urlLink the Great Wall  being a prime symbol.  The result?  The lack of free trade and internalized policy stagnated Chinese progress.  England and France developed the steam engine, and the rest is history.    But what can we learn from this?  First, it sucks to be the leader.  Whether you're a rich businessman, a sports team, or the world's most powerful nation, people, organizations, and countries are going to be gunning for you.  You are the number one target.  How do you stay on top?   urlLink Speak softly and carry a big stick , but don't isolate yourself.  Instinctively, people try to prevent the sniping from tearing them down.  Isolationism leads to the decay of idealism.  And if you can't take the heat, then maybe there's something to be said for second place.  Maybe.

      In my mind, there is one very important question that needs to be answered to sustain the survival of our society.  I'm going to pose it in several different ways, but they all point to the same underlying point:  What is natural?  What is right, and what is wrong?  What are the fundamental foundations upon which everything is constructed?  Are there fundamental laws that govern everything around us?  Let's assume that there are laws that govern the Universe that cannot be broken.  We'll call them "natural laws."  Physists definitely think there are rules that cannot be broken.  Religious people feel the same way.  So do philosophers, anthropologists, psychologists, biologists, etc.  Problems arise when nobody agrees what these fundamental laws are.  Take Kant for example.  In one article, he posited that human vanity is a major driving force in human history.  Without it, there is no reason to do more than what is necessary to survive, which in turn causes cultural stagnation.  A Christian, on the other hand, would not want to hear this.  To some, vanity is a sin and removing vanity from life is part of improving human culture.    But can you really overcome vanity?  The philosopher would say no.  The Christian would say yes.  If you can overcome vanity, is it a fundamental and therefore "natural law?" According to our definition, no.  Natural laws are rules that simply cannot be broken.    What does it mean for something to be natural or unnatural?  In my opinion, something is natural if it is  supposed  to happen.  This lends itself to a discussion on destiny and whether or not events are predetermined.  I don't think that destiny refers to being able to predict the exact state of the Universe at a precise point in time.  Instead, I think that destiny refers to a general orderly procession of events.  The Universe is moving in a certain direction (and I don't mean physically) -- a direction steered by a certain set of fundamental laws.  So if something is natural because it is  destined  to happen, then it follows that unnatural occurances are when you alter the destiny of something.  Is this possible?  This reasoning provides a sort of feed-back loop that can quickly become a confuscating trap of nature versus morality.    For example, take the issue of stem cell research.  The US government is banned from funding any stem cell research.  Why?  Because President Bush decided that it was "unnatural."  But is it unnatural?  President Bush, being a religious man, might say that a person who loses both their kidneys to disease did so because it was pre-ordained by God.  To find another person who might have a kidney to donate is natural.  To grow another kidney from stem cells would be unnatural, because only God should have the power to create people (or parts thereof).  But if natural laws are impossible to violate, and it is clearly possible to violate this law of creating useful organs, then how can this law be natural?  It's not.  It is immorale (in the eyes of some), not unnatural.  This brings us to an important point.  Morality is a set of artificial laws that  should  be followed, but can be violated.  Therefore, morality is not a set of laws that ultimately govern the Universe (unfortunately).  What if you take a non-religious view on this issue?  What if you think that instead of following the will of God, that the world follows the rule of evolution.  If a person is born with a defective heart, is it okay to give that person a new heart so that he may produce children with defective hearts?  Is it okay that we have medicine so that people with asthma can produce more asthmetic children?  Would the world be a better place if there were no people with heart defects or asthma?  Again, if it were a natural law, it could not be broken.  But are we really breaking the law?  Some might argue that medicine, gene therapy and genetic engineering included, are a natural extension of this law, not an exception.  So why is it so important to discover these fundamental natural laws if they can't be broken?  The reason is that even though you cannot change destiny, you can certainly slow it down.  You can try to keep people from researching stem cells.  You can try to keep gays from marrying.  You can try to dictate your own false and artificial laws to those around you, but you are doing nothing but retarding the development of humankind.  You must understand the laws to understand your destiny.  You must embrace your destiny.  You can help it, but you can't force it.  You can slow it, but you can't fight it.   So in the governance of man, leaders should follow a certain philosphy.  Look for policies that grease the wheels of destiny.  Avoid those that fight it.  Those who abide by this go down as great leaders.  Those who don't will be remembered for driving their followers into the ground.

       "Aww, you can use facts to prove anything."  --  Homer Simpson   So K, do you think that people didn't really know that Kerry is a "Ted Kennedy Democrat?"  It should have been apparent when Kennedy came out of nowhere to right Kerry's ship when his campaign went into free-fall early on.  If it wasn't, then it must be obvious considering who was with Kerry all night on Super Tuesday.  If what you say is true, then people thought they were going to get a middle-of-the-road democrat, but instead got a left-wing liberal.  Oh!  I feel a great conspiracy theory coming on here.  Maybe, just maybe, the Republicans somehow manipulated the media into painting Dean as a left-wing extremist and John Kerry as someone who leans toward the middle.  Then, after the national conventions, the Bush camp will be able to use Kerry's liberal-ness to turn everyone against him.  Yep, that's definitely it.  Stupid people.

       urlLink Kerry Lays Claim to Democratic Nomination   Ladies and gentlemen, your democratic presidential nominee.  I took a "sick day" yesterday, meaning I only worked from 9:00am to 5:30pm instead of my usual doctor like (or  urlLink Rusty -like) hours.  I spoke to an old friend from college friend on the telephone, and her stories of delivering babies was enough to send me over the top.    Thankfully, or maybe not, the democratic nomination process is coming to a close.  Senator John Kerry destroyed Senator John Edwards last night, so the game between President Bush and Kerry is now afoot.    Several cable news stations made note of Kerry's liberal voting record last night.  In fact, one anchor cited Kerry as having the most liberal voting record of all 100 current sitting senators.  That's pretty liberal.  If this is true, I find it really fascinating that he was chosen to run for president.  It seems like the democratic party has been trying to stay in the middle of the road lately with candidates like Bill Clinton and Al Gore.  In this presidential nomination process, when the nomination came down to either Edwards (who was the last person who could claim to lean toward the middle) and Kerry (far left), Kerry blew the middle away.  Is this some sort of backlash against the ultra-right?  Are the democrats looking to fight fire with fire?  Is Kerry going to be ultra-left when he gets in office, or will he mellow and slide toward the middle?  Tune in next time...

I hate to think that the best player of our generation and probably one of the top five players of all time has earned his reputation through the use of illegal substances.  I don't think baseball wants to go on any more.  They have one team that is willing to spend 50% more than their closest rival (the Red Sox).  Their players union and team owners are so far apart on most issues that they have to have a strike or lock-out every three years or so.  And now the superstars in the sport are under heavy scrutiny because of this BALCO scandal.  What a ridiculous business.

       urlLink Stillwell  kicked my ass again this morning.  Better than where it kicked me last time, yet I'm still somewhat disappointed.  Somehow, when I was contemplating breaking in to the whole mountain biking hobby thing, I didn't think it would be a death defying sport where I'd be constantly worried for my life.  I didn't see the steep sandy downhills over steps, roots, rocks and logs in the brochure.  In fact, I think I missed the brochure entirely.  No, I pictured myself riding through the woods, communing with Wally the woodchuck and Mitch the muskrat, stopping occasionally to listen to the whisper of the wind through the trees or find pictures in the clouds slowly drifting overhead.    Boy was I wrong.  Stillwell gave me my first spectacular over-the-handlebars wreck this morning.  I don't know who built this one black diamond section on this trail but it is rediculously difficult.  Somehow I came off a hill with a little jump and managed to plant my front wheel sideways.  If you've ever ridden a bike, or seen a wheel for that matter, you should know that wheels roll front to back better than they slide side to side.  So naturally my bike decides to stop in its tracks which was news to my body as I did a superman over the handlebars and landed in spectacular fashion on my head and shoulders.  Thankfully it rained a little yesterday so the ground had a nice cushy give as I collapsed in a heap in the middle of the trail.  But I carried on.  I picked myself up, gathered my dignity, gave Wally and Mitch the finger and rode on.  Until next time, Stillwell.

      My weekends are quickly turning into the anti-week.  I guess that's redundent, but you'd have to be me to understand.  There are people who work here on Long Island during the week and return to their families in Minnesota on the weekends.  That's insanity.  It makes my semi-monthly trip to Virginia look like a trip to the grocery store.  Nonetheless, my trips to the Old Dominion can be quite taxing on mind, body and soul.  Actually, taxing is probably not the word.  The return trip is taxing.  The week of work between trips is taxing, but the trip down and the time I spend there is not taxing in any way.  In fact, it's refreshing.  Enlightening.  Moving.  Thrilling.  Whatever adjective you want to use (positive ones only, please).    Last week was hell, so a quick jaunt to VA was well appreciated on my part.  Saturday was spent watching the beautiful people at  urlLink Foxfield .  If you've never been, it's basically a really big  urlLink UVA  greek tailgate party set on the infield of a horse track.  Everyone get dressed up (guys in their ugliest pants and shirts with ties, girls in their sun dresses) come to the track and sit around in the sun, drinking heavily, getting their first really bad sunburn of the season.  It's tradition.  Consider yourself lucky if you glance the rear end of a horse as it sprints past you.  Sunday was spent at the  urlLink March for Women's Lives  on the Mall in DC.  The march was originally planned as a Pro-Choice rally, but it quickly snowballed into a " urlLink Bush-must-be-removed-at-all-costs-to-improve-everyone's-lives-world-wide " rally with a women's theme.  Not a bad place to pick up a cute, intelligent, empowered woman if you have the guts.  I don't really have a strong opinion on the abortion issue as it doesn't really personally affect me, but I thought I'd go to experience my first rally.  It was worth it.  Some people project that there were over a million people there.  To say it was massive would be an understatement.  Definitely a good life experience.  I keep telling people that Bush is creating a world-wide political environment that could potentially be more explosive than it was in the 60's.  Just watch.

      It's been raining for three days straight now.  This isn't the good kind of rain, either.  This is the long, barely there, soaking everything to the core kind of rain.  Actually, it   is   the good kind of rain, isn't it?  The rain is toying with me, though.  On one hand, it's keeping me from the one thing I want most right now -- to go mountain biking.  On the other hand, it suits my mood perfectly.  I want to sleep a lot and not think about the billions of things that need to be done -- taxes being high on that list.  But I can't sleep.  Well, I could sleep, if I let myself.  But in the words of a good friend's t-shirt, "I'll sleep when I'm dead."    I saw  urlLink The Producers  on Broadway this Sunday.  Sunday was Easter for you atheists and agnostics out there.  I'm not a hugely religious person, but I do like to be with my family on major holidays.  So why was I in NYC, you ask?  Usability, my friend.  I wanted to book tickets to The Producers a couple of months ago.  I went to their website, entered my date of choice and clicked submit.  I got a result back which surprised me because I expected the show to be sold out.  It was.  What the website gave me was the first show available after my date, which was Easter Sunday, April 11th.  I being, the typical bumbling internet user that I am, immediately bought the non-refundable tickets.  This is quite a racket they have going here.  I took the Kona out for it's first long-distance spin on Saturday.  I rode about 15 miles on the  urlLink W&OD Railroad .  It was a fantastic ride.  The weather was immaculate.  The trail -- although paved -- was perfect.  And 15 miles was just about my limit for riding before my a$$ went numb.  I love the bike.  I'm taking it out again as soon as the trails are dry enough -- this time off-road.  I'll keep you posted on its performance.

      The trip to Vegas started out a little sloppy this morning.  I had to get up at 5:00am to be picked up at 5:45am.  I shared a car with another CA employee who I didn't recognize even though he was wearing a 10 year anniversary watch.  The controller at the car company told me that he was a "big shot" at our company, but I've never heard of him.  Oh well.  I got through security at the airport okay.  It's much easier when all you wear is a shirt, a pair of shorts, and flip-flops.  I chose not to go with heavy clothing despite the nip in the air.  I remember the 114 degree oven that I encountered the last time I arrived in Vegas.  I picked up a cup of coffee and a muffin first thing once I got through security.  I then promptly spilled a third of the coffee on my table.  I was quick on my feet though, so I didn't scald myself.  That's me in a nut shell -- a klutz with a pension for moving quickly when necessary.  A guy saw my predicament and helped me clean it up.  Nice guy.  I read that Song airlines is giving away free tickets to people who are nice to other passengers.  Too bad he was flying the wrong airline.   "How's that working out for you?"   "What?"   "Being nice."

      Remind me not to drink coffee with my American Idol next time.  It makes for bad moods the next day (indirectly, of course).  And yes, you read that right.  I watched American Idol last night.  It's not so much that I like to watch American Idol as I don't have a washer/dryer in my apartment.  Therefore I must use my friend's washer/dryer, which comes with an evening with said friend who happens to be obsessed with the show.  It's a small price to pay to not have to use a public facility.  In fact, this friend is so obsessed with AI that he is participating in a pool to see who can pick the order in which the contestants are dismissed.  It's sick, I know.  Anyway, American Idol is not the cause of my bad mood.  The coffee is.

      I just got back from VA last night.  I dropped the lady off at the airport for her business trip to Boca Raton (I am so jealous) and cruised on back to LI via Penn.  This route tends to be 1+ hour longer, but I think it's worth it to not have to sit in the Beltway parking lot.    I spent the weekend down in Bedford this weekend.  Sorry Adrian, but it was a family weekend -- I'll be sure to drop in next time I'm down there.  Susan graduated from  urlLink UVA  on Sunday.  Despite the ubiquitous red fences marking construction and renovation, Charlottesville remains as enchanting as ever.   I really miss college.  I wouldn't say that I missed it last year or even three months ago, but I miss it now.  I think it's because my job has transformed into a glorified e-mail answering / forwarding service.  All I do is try to keep the project moving, addressing problems with kludgey solutions that will get the product out the door.  There is definitely no creativity in my job at this point of the project, so I can't help but think about how things would be different if I went back to school.  I'll entertain those thoughts later, though.  I haven't had a chance to ride my mountain bike since last Wednesday.  I rode Stillwell again.  This time I think it was a draw, which brings my record to 0-2-1.  She didn't throw me over the handlebars, but the climbs got me a couple of times.  One day I will overcome the sheer terror I feel on the downhills and the complete exhaustion I experience going back up.  You have to wonder why I do this.  It's back to Las Vegas for another seven days of company conference fun starting this Thursday.  I'll give them one thing: this thing gets better organized every year, which in turn translates to less 16 hour days for me.  Nonetheless, I am not looking forward to this year's trip.

      Not unlike the always clever  urlLink Sports Guy  from  urlLink ESPN , I'm including a running diary of this past weekend (which miraculously was held here on LI instead of in some exotic place like Northern VA or Indianapolis).  Actually, I take that back.  This is about as disingenuous as blogs come, so don't hold your breath for a high degree of entertainment here.  So, without further ado, here is my weekend.  ** Note that this account is abridged as I did not really keep a "running" diary, nor is my memory what it used to be.  You know how it is.     Friday, June 25th 5:45pm  -- After a grueling day of waiting for some forms to be processed, a couple of the guys decided to go grab dinner.  Where to go?  ...Where to go????   6:15pm  -- Following a heated discussion via Exchange Messenger, we finally decide on  urlLink John Harvard's  where much food, beverage, and work-related gossip was consumed by all.   7:15pm  -- We've finished eating, but decide to stay at our table and continue our conversation.  Who cares if the waitress is trying to make a living?   8:00pm  -- We're guilt ridden at this point.  George and I order desserts, Omar a coffee...I'm not sure if we were hungry or just submitting our orders as a peace offering.   8:10pm  -- My dessert emerges from the kitchen.  It's a brownie with about a gallon of ice cream piled on top.  I mildly complain about serving sizes in America as I start shoveling it in...   9:00pm  -- I'm down to three scoops of ice cream.  I don't think I'm going to make it.  I can feel all five days worth of working out slipping away.  Oh well, there's always next week...   9:30pm  -- Omar and I head back to my place to meet Ed before the movie.  This seems like a dumb idea considering John Harvard's is right next to the theater, six miles from my house.  I can't believe these guys have lived on the island for over three years and still don't know how to get to the mall from our office.     10:20pm  -- Omar, Ed, and I arrive at the theater.  That's theatre for you Brits out there.  There's a huge congregation of teenagers out in front, dressed in the most skanky outfits you can imagine.  Okay, maybe not that skanky... "Are you going to ask?  Alright, I'll ask.  Where do the high school girls hang out around here?"      10:30pm  -- The theater is packed.  So much so that we can't find three seats together.  The best part is when people just needed space for their purses / other personal items.  Purses are people too.  I don't know why we bother sometimes.  There are too many damn people on this stupid island.   12:30am  -- Okay, we were just subjected to two hours of intense Bush-hating.  I felt a little like Winston Smith in  urlLink 1984  where everyone is supposed to watch the TVs for the "Two Minutes Hate," screaming to the point of turning purple over the images being flashed in our faces.  Well, maybe more fuchsia than purple.  It was a good time.   1:00am  -- Ah, another day in the books.  Good times.

      Sorry for the temporary disruption in posts.  You know how deadlines can be.  So I'm back from Indianapolis, slightly sun-burned but no less for wear.  The  urlLink US Grand Prix  was, as its name suggests, grand.  Here are some of the highlights.  First of all, this race seems to get more run-down every year I attend.  My Dad picked up on this as well.  We've been to this race all five years that it's been held in Indianapolis.  Every year, the races are great, but we've noticed a decline in the team merchandise that's sold in the track's infield area.  Personally, I think this trend could be caused by one of two things.  Either Tony George is charging the teams too much to bring their stuff in or it's simply not cost effective to haul all their sideshows with them across the pond.  Personally, I miss seeing all the high-end  urlLink BMWs  and  urlLink Mercedes .  The  urlLink West McLaren Mercedes  team didn't even show up this year.    One highlight of the weekend was getting a chance to ride a  urlLink Segway .  After signing my life away in case of a freak accident (and so that they can get a telemarketer to call me every night at dinner time), they let me hop on one of these things for a spin.  If you don't know, Segways are supposed to revolutionize modern urban travel.  Personally, I think they're just a way to get urbanites to join in the American obesity craze.  It took some time to get my balance on it, but after three laps around the course I had the hang of it.  It's a fun toy, but nothing to replace my standard bipedal form of locomotion.  The race itself was pretty exciting.  Ferrari finished one-two again, with Michael Schumacher taking the checkered flag.  Only eight of the starting twenty cars actually finished the race.    This was the first year with a significant number of wrecks.  I'm quite disappointed in how the wrecks were handled by the track officials.  There was a huge crash on turn one that knocked four cars out of the race and littered the track with carbon fiber debris.  F1 is known for red flagging (stopping) races to clean this type of mess up.  We learned why that's such a good idea in this race.  After three or four laps with a safety car governing the pace, they let the field race again.  On his first lap after the caution Fernando Alonso decided to turn left instead of right at the end of the straight.  This would have been fine had there not been a wall immediately to his left.  Why did he turn into a wall, you ask?  He had no choice after his right rear tire went flat from track debris.  This wreck left even more debris on the track that remained there for a few laps.  A few laps after Alonso's wreck, Ralf Schumacher hit the wall at full speed (around 200 MPH) after suffering a sudden flat tire.  Thankfully, he hit back first, resulting in a bruised back and a concussion.  I say thankfully because his injuries would have been very severe had he hit nose first.  He easily could have died.  Now, as it turns out, both wrecks were caused by flat tires.  Flat tires that were almost certainly caused by running over carbon fiber that was left on the track.  Flat tires that could have been prevented if the race had been stopped to clean up the mess left from the first wreck.  I'm just glad Ralf was not more seriously hurt, or the  urlLink FIA  would have a lot of explaining to do this week.

      Since I still don't have an internet connection at home, and because I can't spend all day at work writing in my blog, I'm now instituting a new format.  When I don't have time to write down what I want to say, I'll just update less frequently with a "notebook" of items that I think are noteworthy (to me, not necessarily to the world).  This is the first such notebook...  ---  I went to go see  urlLink Control Room  on Wednesday night.  This film is a documentary following  urlLink Al Jazeera , outlining the differences in perception between western and middle eastern media sources on the Iraqi war.  It was an interesting concept and started out well but started to feel very repetitive towards the end of the film.  If you don't have 1.5 hours to spend on this movie, just read the  urlLink Washington Post's   urlLink synopsis .   Note that the article requires free registration with Washington Post.com.   ---  I was in a very annoying meeting yesterday.  Basically, the team that was supposed to deliver the meat for one of our applications is finally in position to do so.......one year too late.  So they want to compare applications, theirs (an acquired product that they extended) vs. ours (a bandaid solution that was put in place waiting for them).  So they showed off a little bit.  The guy presenting constantly had this cocky smile on his face.  That bothered me.  Another guy came in late.  That bothered me.  His arms were freakishly short (circus short).  That bothered me.  An all-in-all annoying meeting.  ---  I'm on the road again tonight.  I have to get to LaGuardia airport for my flight to Indianapolis for the  urlLink US Grand Prix   urlLink Formula One  race on Sunday.  This is an annual trip for me that was bumped up from its usual September time slot to June.  I'm hoping that the weather will be okay.

      Phew...this health binge is murder.  I've decided to not only reform my exercise behavior (work be dammed) but to also focus on what I eat on a day to day basis.  I've done pretty well today.  Thus far, I've consumed the following:  1 cup of oatmeal (Raisin Date & Walnut variety) + 1/2 cup skim milk 2 cups coffee + 1 Equal packet + 1/4 cup skim milk 1 sandwich with:    - 1 slice turkey breast    - 1 slice harvarti cheese    - Yellow mustard 1 banana 1 20 oz Lemon-Lime Gatorade  All in all, not too bad by my standards.  Now I just need to keep this up for the rest of my life.  Watching "Super Size Me" can be a life changing event.  Evidently, subsisting on  urlLink McDonald's food  alone can kill an adult male in little more than 30 days.  Go figure.  Don't believe me?  Check out the  urlLink film by Morgen Spurlock.

       urlLink Yahoo e-mail battles Google's Gmail - Jun 15, 2004   Ahh, good stuff.   urlLink Yahoo  and  urlLink Google  squaring off for the battle of the century.  It's interesting to see Yahoo make these moves in an attempt to quell the coming storm that is Google.  First, a new search engine, now better e-mail services.  Yahoo has to realize that Google's play in the e-mail market is about much more than just giving people more space.  It's about redefining how people think about e-mail.  They're treating e-mail as information, and Google is the ultimate in organizing information so that you can find what you're looking for.  Yahoo on the other hand is about bringing people together into one place.  Will an extra 96 MB of e-mail storage be enough to keep them around?  Who knows.  What I wonder is how this will affect  urlLink Hotmail .  You know that Mr. Gates won't sit idly by and watch these two grab up an even larger share of the market.  This will be a fun one to watch unfold.

      I really need to break out of this cycle of working out like a madman for three months and taking three months off.  It kills you when you try get back into being active.  I played tennis last night and today my legs are killing me -- which is great since I'm riding the mountain bike this afternoon.  Sore legs make for fun hill climbs.  Speaking of mountain biking, I read a great  urlLink article  in  urlLink National Geographic Adventure magazine  last night.  Apparently, I lived an hour away from "Little Switzerland" when I was in  urlLink college .  I really wish I had known about these places while I was there.  They would have made for fantastic pledge rolls or even day hiking trips.

      Alright, I've almost got it now.  The charge to my credit card from paypal finally showed up today, so I was able to submit my lifetime membership payment to freeshell.  Of course, I forgot to bring my laptop in with me today, so I can't go out to the conference room to telnet in and setup my web site...  One step at a time.  Soon I will have my own site where I can host pictures without worry.  Just wait.

       urlLink CNN.com - Kimmel show pulled for comments - Jun 11, 2004   I watched this "incident" live and didn't think anything of it.  Apparently, Kimmel really ticked some people off in Detroit saying that he didn't want them to win because it isn't worth seeing the fans burn the city (I'm paraphrasing).  His reply is classic:   "What I said about Pistons fans during halftime was a joke, nothing more. If I offended anyone, I'm sorry.  Clearly, over the past 10 years, we in L.A. have taken a commanding lead in post-game riots. If the Lakers win, I plan to overturn my own car."  -- Jimmy Kimmel

      Just kidding.  I'm not really leaving.  At least, I'm not leaving for good...yet.  Another day, another trip to Northern VA.  I'm slipping out of the office early today to hopefully beat the traffic off of the island.  May I make one recommendation?  Never, ever, never ever ever live somewhere where you have to regularly cross a bridge.  Bridges suck, and you can't help but cross them when you live on an island and you want to get off.  Unless that island is Hawaii.  Then you have to fly.  But who would want to leave, anyway?  I wish I lived in Hawaii.  With no job.

      *** Warning: Nerdy commentary that belongs in the new blog follows.  In Software Engineering, as with all other things, you cannot know where you're going, which direction you need to go, or how long it is going to take to get there if you don't know your present location.  This is my pain for the week.  It took our combined teams (development, QA, technical writers, etc.) over three days to gather our summary status to put in a six slide powerpoint presentation for one of our executives.  Can you imagine?  The big boss says, "how's it goin'?" and it takes us four days to reply.  Actually, this is what really happened.  The big boss said, "how's it goin'?"  It probably wasn't that nice, but I'll keep it clean for the kids.  He said, "how's it goin'?" and we said, "Oh crap!  How   is   it going?"  So we scramble around for a couple of days and then we realize that our teams are anywhere from two to eight weeks behind schedule.  Now mind you, these dates that we're going to miss are already four to eight weeks removed from the original target.    It's a comedy, really.  I guess we were going to wait until we had missed the deadlines before we told anybody.  Actually, we probably would have to miss the deadlines to realize that we're behind schedule.  Ridiculous.  The way things should be: If someone says, "how's it going?," we should be able to say, "hold on, let me pull it up."  We need a web site that shows us the important stuff.  What's our deadline.  How much work is left for the dev team?  How many issues do we have?  What's the run rate on our issues?  How's our in-house implementation going?  How many beta clients do we have?  What issues do they have?  This is so obvious that it's painful to talk about.  I have to stop now.

      As I mentioned earlier, I'm trying to get some "free" webspace through  urlLink freeshell.org .  I say "free" because in actuality, you have to mail them $1 in order to activate your web space.  Either that or you have to send them $5 through  urlLink Paypal .  Apparently, there's some overhead of sending it through Paypal.  Anyway, this $1 (or $5, depending on how you do it), will get you 20 MB of free web space.  I said, "cool."  Then I realized that if you give them $37 USD, you get a lifetime account with 100 MB.  I said, "that's really cool."    So, not wanting to expend the energy necessary to find an envelope and mail it to freeshell, I decided to go the Paypal route.  Little did I know that getting a Paypal account is a lot like I imagine getting your own combination to Fort Knox would be.  To start using a paypal account, you must do the following:  1. Create an account. 2. Activate the account by clicking on the link emailed to you. 3. Add a credit card to the account. 4. Allow paypal to charge $1.25 to your credit card. 5. Check your credit card statement for a magic 4-digit PIN. 6. Enter your PIN into your account to activate the credit card. 7. Spend money.  Now, I'm all for security, but this may be overkill.  First of all, you have to physically have the card so that you can enter the security number on the back.  Secondly, you must either wait four days for the charge to be posted to your credit card account, or you have to wait for the physical bill to arrive at your house before you can start spending.    What kind of an online service is this?  I thought that by using Paypal that I'd be saving myself some time.  In actuality, if I had instead just mailed the money to freeshell from the beginning, I'd probably have my account up and running well before Paypal comes through for me.  So for future reference: if you don't already have a paypal account and you need to send somebody money immediately, don't use their service.

      Did anybody else see Kobe's game tying three-pointer with 2.1 seconds left in regulation last night?  Kobe is ridiculous.  As soon as the Lakers closed the gap to one score I knew Kobe was going to make the shot.  There's no way that shot does not go in.  And he got that opportunity thanks to Rasheed Wallace's foul on Shaq, which he miraculously converted into a three point play.    And did anybody doubt that the game belonged to the Lakers once that shot went in?  The Pistons didn't have a chance after that basket.  I'll be surprised if they don't get swept at home to lose the series 4-1.  All this after dominating the middle of the fourth period.  It's sad, really...I don't even care about the NBA.

      Okay.  Some of you are wondering what's going on with the site.  If you haven't been keeping up, we've undergone some transformations of late.  It's nothing special, really.  I lightened up the place a bit, getting rid of the black background.  These new templates are a huge improvement over the choices available before  urlLink Google  took over. Yet another sign of progress marching forward.  The most significant change has been the metamorphosis from being a catch all site to becoming a more personal blog.  Hence the pic of my beautiful mug to the right which may or may not be working right now.  No worries regarding guest authors and the like.  I plan the launch of a brand new blog, replete with superstar writers, in the coming weeks.  I just need to line up the superstars.   urlLink Interested?   You may have noticed the nasty banner that appeared at the top of the page.  This was an unfortunate side affect caused by my change in template.  I really didn't have the energy to dig through the HTML/CSS code to figure out how to cover it up again, so it's going to have to stay for now.   However,  I do plan on activating my  urlLink freeshell  account soon, at which point I plan on moving the entire site (which in turn will remove the advertisements).  If only Paypal weren't such a pain in the a$$ to activate...I'll keep you posted (so to speak).

      We were on the way down to the cafeteria for lunch when the elevator opened to reveal our interim CEO today.  We froze a bit as we processed who exactly was staring back at us.  "Come on in, guys."  He was quite friendly.  We introduced ourselves and told him where we work.  That was about all we could get in before we got to the first floor.  All in all, a pretty awkward situation.  I'll have to prepare some questions in case I run into him again.  I have to work on being prepared for this sort of thing...

Tuesdays are fruit and cereal days, and this lady was here to get her fill.  She came in with a box full of food already in hand, grabbed four ( FOUR! ) boxes of Lucky Charms and disappeared.  Now, I normally would have said something.  Okay, no I wouldn't.  But believe me, I would have given her a scornful look if not for one thing -- she was pregnant.  So I took it easy on her.

      Does anyone else think that the internet has a long way to go to facilitate finding people online?  I conducted an experiment today.  If I wanted to, could I find people with whom I haven't spoken for three to five years?  The resounding answer was no.  No, I can't.  Well, for the most part.  So I'm wondering, if the internet is really mean to bring everyone in the world together -- to connect everyone in the "world wide web," then why can't I at least find a definitive reference to everyone?  The reason?  You can't be found unless you are advertising yourself.    For example, try typing in your full name into your favorite search engine.  Something came up, right?  Why?  Because you use the web and you read things like this stupid blog.  Now try typing in the name of someone who does not use the web the same way you do.  Someone like your mother or grandfather.  What were the results this time?    In my experience, there are four ways for your name to end up on the web:  1. Post your own webpage under you own name. 2. Contribute to online forums such as commenting on  urlLink Amazon.com  or  urlLink Epinions.com.  3. Contribute to an organization that posts their results on the web. 4. Be interesting enough that someone will write about.  So basically, if you are online only to read and not contribute to the world wide web, you are promoting a uni-directional relationship with everyone else in the world.  You are not part of the community.  While this type of anonymity can be useful at times, it denies the true power of the internet.    I don't think there is any way to overcome people's desire to remain anonymous.  I do think that search engines could be made more useful.  Since most people are not going to contribute to the web, someone must contribute for them.  We need better data sources.  I don't need access to the FBI's database, but I would like to find an old friend with whom I've lost contact and would like to call or e-mail.  Is that asking too much?

      God, I'm lame.  I've now moved from my everyday cubicle to a conference room to make myself feel like I'm not at work.  That and the fact that this room has what I thought were "unfirewalled" connections to the internet.  I was almost right.  I'm able to use some applications like AIM which I wouldn't ordinarily be able to access, but I'm still blocked from some websites that I want, such as  urlLink Hello BloggerBot .  Again, bummer.  I  have  had the opportunity to review some of the new "advanced" features that are now provided by our friends at  urlLink Blogger , which have remained as yet untapped.  For one, Blogger now provides real comments.  No more of this external comments crap.  This is good for two reasons (well, three reasons).  First, the site will load faster since it's not depending on external JavaScript files.  Second, the site will come up if said external JavaScript files are unavailable.  And third, your comments will no longer be stored in some shady external database for all the world to read.  You may now resume telling me how sexy I am and whatnot.  A second feature I have now found is the fact that you can now subscribe to a syndicated XML feed of this site.  Simply point your news reader at the URL below and you will receive updates as they occur.  Cool stuff.    urlLink http://victualer.blogspot.com/atom.xml   So thanks be to  urlLink Google , which has completely transformed my blogging (among other  urlLink things ).  May they never start charging for all this cool technology.

      Yeah, that's right.  I'm posting a blog on the weekend.  How is this possible, you ask?  Easy...I came into work.  Many of you know that I still don't have an internet connection at home.  Why?  Because they cost too damn much.  My landlord might get fired if he shares his connection with me.  Something about me possibly downloading kiddie porn or something (which I wouldn't, obviously).  Corporations are weird about getting sued.  ::shrug::  In fact, he's not supposed to use it for personal reasons himself.  His company also won't let us add a second IP address, which would cost me $6.  So cable modem service is entirely out.  The alternative high-bandwidth solutions are DSL and Satellite.  I'm not getting DSL because that would entail getting a phone line, which I don't have.  I'm not paying $80 a month to be able to use the internet for 8 hours a week.  Satellites are equally stupid for me.  So I'm pretty much SOL.  At least until I move some place normal where I have my own cable and phone accounts where I can have control over my own services.  Until then, I am stuck with coming in to the office if I really need access to the web.  Bummer.

      It must have been crossing the 50K mile threshold on my car that did it.  Or maybe it's the Air Force brat in me.  Whatever it is, I'm starting to feel that itch -- that desire to go some place new.  Did you know that my stint at the  urlLink University  tied for the longest I've ever lived in one town.  And you can't even really count that considering I moved every year (yes, even  urlLink Lambeth  counts as a move since I couldn't leave my stuff there over the summer).  Wow...nostalgia just set in.  The image of moving my stuff from ole Courtenay to Sugarmeyer's apartment while I was at beach week my first year just rushed back to me.    Anyway, I can see two potential targets squaring up to compete for my presence.  First, there's the Northern Virginia area.  Serviced by the metropolitan city of  urlLink Washington DC , Virginia certainly has its draw.  It also has the unfair advantage of housing my fiance at the moment.  On the other hand there's  urlLink Raleigh, North Carolina .  Raleigh has its own potential, especially in the real estate department.  It's very important to me to own my home in near future, so Raleigh has some draw for me.  As you can probably guess, Northern Virginia is dominating the competition right now.  Tune in later to see how the competition is going.

      I managed to catch up on my reading a little on my way out to Vegas and back.  I finally finished Nonzero, which -- thanks to an unscheduled three month hiatus from reading -- ended up taking me four months to fully absorb.  If you'll recall, Nonzero's tagline is "The Logic of Human Destiny."  Fascinating book.  Pick it up if you want to think about why things are the way they are.  I followed up Nonzero with The Tipping Point -- a book recommended through multiple channels.  The Tipping Point basically outlines how information is disseminated.  There are three people who move information: Connectors (people who know everybody), Mavens (people who gather inordinate amounts of information), and Sales People (people who can convince people to try something).  Then there's everyone else.  I am none of the above.  Well, I'm part of everyone else to be more accurate.  Bummer.  What are you?

      Okay, I'm back from my travel binge.  I experienced a lot over the past few weeks, and I hope to capture at least some of it here.  Not all of us carry a travel log with us which can be transcribed to the web.  So I'll have to try to pull it from memory.  I got back from my Memorial Day weekend trip last night.  I would have been back sooner, but I was trapped by the same storms that spawned 90+ tornados the day before in the Midwest.  This weekend followed immediately on the heels of my trip to Vegas.  And by immediately, I mean less than 12 hours after I arrived in NY, I was on the road down to VA.  So you can imagine that I'm not too well rested at this point.  Rachael and I headed down to Amar and Connie's house in Raleigh on Friday.  We got there around 2:00am and immediately fell in love with the area.  The most attractive thing about NC is its affordability.  I really want to buy a house down there now because lord knows I can't afford one here or in Northern VA.    The four of us set out to Wilmington Saturday morning.  We stopped along the way at  urlLink Duplin Winery  -- the largest winery in the south.  This place was amazing.  Not only did they have one of the more comprehensive tours I've ever been on, but they also have a free wine-tasting session where you can sample 12-15 of their muscadine grape based wines.  Good stuff.  After purchasing our fill of wine (they liquored us up), we headed further into Rose Hill, NC to take pictures of the world's largest frying pan.  That's right.  This bad boy uses over 200 gallons of cooking oil to cook over 300 chickens at the annual poultry festival.  I guess they really like fried chicken in NC.  I have pictures if you're interested.  Sunday was supposed to be our day at the beach, so to speak.  Connie, being a west coast baby, had never seen the Atlantic ocean before.  Unfortunately, it rained all morning.  No worries, though.  We're an all-conditions crew, so we went to the beach anyway.  Albeit, we were only there for ten minutes while Connie dipped her toes in the pond.  Later that night we went on a ghost tour of historical Wilmington.  It wasn't all that scary, but the tour lead us through some gorgeous homes and the stories weren't bad either.  The only problem is that Wilmington is a typical southern coastal city.  It was extremely hot and humid and we were perpetually chased by a cloud of mosquitoes.    ...

      At the behest of a near and dear (not deer)  urlLink friend , I decided to attend a one day seminar hosted by none other than E.T. ( urlLink Edward Tufte ) yesterday.&nbsp; The title of the seminar was " urlLink Presenting Data and Information ."&nbsp; Personally, and I think Kendrick would agree with this, I believe that this course should be requisite for all engineers, statasticians, graphic artists, software designers, accountants, and anyone else who ever needs to communicate a large amount of data to someone who might care.&nbsp; Tufte's critique of Power Point, especially the case study revolving around a single slide that decided the fate of NASA's Columbia space orbiter, is alone&nbsp;worth the $320 admission fee.&nbsp; Company won't spend the money to send you?&nbsp; Don't work for a company?&nbsp;  urlLink Go  on our own.&nbsp; It's that good.&nbsp; I kid you not.

       urlLink Stillwell  (or SW as those in the know like to call it) is coming apart at the seams.&nbsp; It's to the point that I don't know if I can ride there any more.&nbsp; I guess I have to, since there aren't many trails to choose from here, but I don't have to like it. &nbsp; Mother nature is the culprit.&nbsp; That and the trail is not cut correctly in some places so erosion has become a huge problem.&nbsp; This trail scared the bejeezes out of me the first time I rode it.&nbsp; You might recall some other posts I've written about it.&nbsp; The downhills were scary to me then because they were so sandy with tons of roots, so it was hard for me to trust the bike and just let it go.&nbsp; Now, water has eroded the downhill sections so that there are repetitive drops as high as a foot and a half in some sections. &nbsp; One downhill&nbsp;section got me pretty good last night.&nbsp; The section in question starts at a relatively steep downward angle and then turns 45 degrees to the right.&nbsp; Immediately after turning there are three drops in a row, averaging about a foot in height.&nbsp; I hit the first two drops okay, but I came off at a weird angle on the third.&nbsp; I hit the ground leaning back and slightly to the left, which immediately&nbsp;put me off balance, causing me to fall off the bike to my right.&nbsp; Thanks to the excellent grooming on this particular section, I landed on a particularly hard packed patch of dirt, covered with gravel.&nbsp; Needless to say, my shin, hip, and forearm are a little worse off than they were yesterday at this time. &nbsp; The bike held up okay.&nbsp; The handlebars only looked like a twisted mess when all was said and done.&nbsp; I untangled the wires from the post and made sure everything was in working order.&nbsp; It took a good few tugs to get the rear break working again (which is essential for this type of trail), but I eventually got everything (including my legs) back into riding shape.&nbsp; You can imagine that I was a little more hessitant on the rest of the downhill sections following this spill. &nbsp; The only problem I've had with my bike is my toe clip keeps breaking.&nbsp; The toe clip is just a strap that keeps your foot on the pedal.&nbsp; I smashed the reflector that was holding it in place, so now I can pop it out of the bolts that "hold it down" at will practically.&nbsp; I'm thinking about getting clipless pedals now.&nbsp; Don't ask me why they're called clipless, because they're the type that you "clip" in with special shoes and everything.&nbsp; I'm a little hessitant to buy them for two reasons.&nbsp; First, it's going to cost me about $100 for the pedals and the shoes.&nbsp; Second, I'm not so confident about my riding skills that I can trust myself to not wreck all the time.&nbsp; You can imagine what it's like to wreck when you are literally attached to the bike...I don't think it would be much fun. &nbsp; It's time for another long ride at Rocky Point.&nbsp; I think RP is approximately 21 miles long if you do the whole thing.&nbsp; Last time I did this, my legs almost snapped in half from cramping.&nbsp; I hope to avoid such a fate this time.&nbsp; Until next time, cheers!   &nbsp;

       urlLink Mase: The Second Coming   I'll admit it.  I don't know if it was the flashy clothes or the catchy tunes (written by other, more talented song writers of yesteryear), but I bought into the whole Bad Boy group back in the day.  I think the year was 1999 and yes, I bought Mase's first CD.    Mase dropped off the face of the planet that year.  He had a couple of hits, cultivated by Sean Combs, aka Puff Daddy, aka Puffy, aka P-Diddy, master of the  urlLink Bad Boy  empire which went into rapid decline following the murder of Biggie Smalls.  Where did Mase go?  He apparently went spiritual, pursuing his relationship with God by becoming a pastor and forming his own church.  MTV says he needed to recharge his batteries.  Well, they must be at full rev now, because he's back.  I couldn't help but laugh out loud when I saw this video last night.  Welcome Back is the title of his first single, obviously appropriate for the situation.  It's pretty catchy, but it's hilarious to see Mase again, looking the same as he did in 1999 when he disappeared.  For those who don't know any better it appears he just stepped out of a time machine with the same style of clothes, jewels, and dance moves...utterly unbelievable.  My favorite part of the interview is when "Mase addresses all the MCs who copped his style while he was away..."  This stuff is classic.

      Tales of the insanity of buying a house in Northern Virginia...  The little woman and I started looking at houses immediately following my boss' approval of the move to VA.  Now, I have very little experience with this.  Actually, scratch that.  I have  no  experience with buying a house.  My experience is on the order of overhearing guys talk about it in the locker room here at work (no, I don't work for a football team).  Fortunately, I have my parents to fall back on, considering they have bought and sold many a house in their day.  My Dad was in the  urlLink Air Force , afterall.  Even their abundance of experience could not prepare them for this market.  Houses stay on the market in Northern VA for about three days.  THREE DAYS!  This isn't the kind of market where you can sit and think about what you want.  You also can't make any mistakes as we found out the hard way.  Ah well, that house wasn't meant to be, so we will just find something better and cheaper and save money in the meantime.  Jerks.

      Amazingly, my only bicycle part mishap occurred on my very first ride, and I wasn't even riding at the time.  Jason drove Dave and I over to Rocky Point one Saturday morning with their bikes on the roof and  urlLink mine  mounted on the trunk.  Unfortunately, we mounted my bike in the wrong orientation so that the front tire was dangling right in front of the car's exhaust.  We heard a loud bang about half way there, but thought we had just run over something.  As it turned out, my front tire had melted, making the innertube explode.  Jason ended up lending me another tire, but it's always bothered me that they don't match.  Like my man  urlLink TJ , I'm big on  urlLink symmetry .  Tomorrow, I plan on finally remedying this problem by going down to Bike Junkie in Bethpage and picking up a new front  urlLink Tioga Terra Firma 26 x 1.95 tire .  They apparently don't make these tires anymore (which shouldn't surprise me since they don't even make my bike any more), so I have to get a set of "slightly used" tires for less than $20.  Or so the bike store owner's wife told me.  The next step?  I have to read the chapter in  urlLink Zinn  about replacing a tire.  I don't quite trust my own bicycle maintenance just yet.  So I'm going to have to take it easy for fear that my wheels fall off in mid-ride.  I don't have to describe how catastrophic that might be.

      Pictures in blogs are cool.  That's why I thought I would download  urlLink Hello  and try uploading a few photos.  Basically, there is a bot out there somewhere that connects to the Hello network that you send pictures to which will post them to your blog for you.  It's a pretty cool concept.  Hello is a pretty nice program.  The idea is to create an instant messaging service (much like  urlLink AIM ,  urlLink MSN ,  urlLink Yahoo ,  urlLink ICQ ,  urlLink etc .) that is centered around sharing photos.  For that much, it succeeds.  It provides a pretty area where you can pick your photos and send them to your friends.  Unfortunately, I don't seem to have any friends but the blogger bot.  Picture connoisseurs will be a little disappointed with this as a web publishing tool.  The pictures that get uploaded are little grainy (as you can tell from the Space Needle below) and there aren't enough options for how you want the pictures published.  I was hoping for an easy way to tell a story around a picture, but this is really just a tool to get the picture up on the web fast and easy.  As for options, you're pretty limited.  You can pick which size you want your thumbnail and picture to be (thus the poor compression), what color your border will be, what tagline to add to your photos, and which blog to publish it to.  I'm disappointed that I can't publish more than one picture per post and that I can't format it better (i.e. center).    All in all, this is not a bad tool for the average person.  But if you want to keep your blog "professional" looking (or at least like a human made it), stick to manually adding the images using your img tag.

I say it is apt because on August 2, 2004, Herndon, VA will become my new home office.  I'm moving to VA!  And not just for the weekend!  I think I'll still be traveling between VA and NY a lot, but it will be by plane from now on.  Soon I will have broadband service at home, I'll be able to reduce rate I'm putting miles on my car, and I'll be able to visit my parents more than twice a year.

       urlLink Senate Report Blasts Intelligence Agencies' Flaws (washingtonpost.com)   This is a huge problem.  After all the reorganization and restructuring, our intelligence agencies are still unable to clearly prove that a particular country poses a threat to our own.  Working off assumptions and making guesses, our intelligence community allowed the Bush administration to pull the wool over congress' eyes.  Senator John D. Rockefeller IV's (D-WV) quote pretty much sums it up:   "...our credibility is diminished, our standing in the world has never been lower."   I think the most frustrating part is that Bush won't do anything about it.  He decided to send young men and women into a hostile environment, close to 900 of which lost their lives.  How can he not be upset that the foundation for this decision was based on evidence that simply did not exist?  He took our country to war because the intelligence community failed to do their job.    If I were him, I'd be pissed.  There's nothing worse than your subordinates maneuvering you into a bad decision with their own incompetence.  But he insists on remaining loyal to his people.  Bush might gain some credibility by actually firing the people who are ultimately responsible for all of these mistakes: George Tenent (already gone), Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz...  Instead, he refuses to admit that his administration has made a mistake.  Worse, he refuses to admit that  he  made a mistake.  This isn't leadership.  This is the story of one jerk hanging on to power by his fingernails such that he can continue to pad the wallets of his friends, family, business associates and other cohorts.  It's time for this to end.

      I swear that Bush is aiming to destroy everything that America stands for -- everything that has been built over the past 228 years has been damaged in little more than a year and a half of destructive governance.  That's not even half of a presidential term, which is more than he deserves.  I am completely flabbergasted that he has been able to single handedly exposed every flaw in our system of government.  He proved that the electoral college is an antiquated system that fails the people.  He proved that a maniacal executive can steal war powers from congress under cloak of public tragedy (read 9/11).  He proved that he could pass legislation ( urlLink The PATRIOT ACT ) to "fight terrorism" by making sure you don't read the  urlLink wrong books .  He proved that Americans are capable of equal to greater degrees of torture than the "dictators" we like to overthrow.    Now Dubya is trying to prove that he can write discrimination and religious ideology into our federal constitution.  This while we are still fighting the affects of our past discrimination against blacks and women.  I know that you may not be the most politically active person out there; I'm definitely not.  I know that you may not agree with gay marriage.  But please try to think long term and do the American thing, the right thing.  Send an email your  urlLink Senator  asking him or her vote against  urlLink writing discrimination  into the fabric of our society.

      I can't think of a better name for my favorite place to commune with nature than Cathedral Pines.  It is truly becoming my temple, even if the act itself is less pius and more aggressive than most people of the spiritual persuasion would approve.  Yesterday was another me and my Nunu experience, laden with high speed cornering and plenty of climbs.    Cathedral Pines is the "beginner's" trail on the island, which is the reason why I practice there.  I'm less likely to kill myself at "CP" than I would just up the road on the significantly more challenging Rocky Point trail.  You can gauge the level of difficulty by the names of the black diamond portions of the trail.  Deer Path versus The Dragon.  Boundary Line versus Rattlesnake.  It turns out that Deer Path is aptly named as I happened to scare up a doe as I ripped through one section.  This is nothing compared to when Dan and I had to slam on our breaks at Rocky Point to avoid running over a man who was leading a baby fawn away from the road.  The fawn stopped at each of our bikes in turn to sniff our legs as it followed the man like a puppy.  I hope it made it.

      If there ever was a poster for OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder), Omar would be its child.  Omar is a short, neurotic Indian fellow with a hodge-podge accent accrued while living life all over the globe.  Just his name is a funny, misleading contradiction, and if you ever heard him speak, you would never guess his origin.  He looks Hispanic (people speak Spanish to him wherever he goes), his name is Muslim, his accent is indecipherable, and his family is counted among the microscopic minority of catholic Indians.  Don't tell him I mentioned this on the web, but his drunken adventures are legendary.  He, of course, is completely embarrassed by the stories that come from his nights on the LI bar and club scene, but I won't let him forget.  This is the man who went up to a girl in a bar and said straight faced (and I quote to the best of my ability), "I've been studying them, and I'm positive that your left breast is bigger than your right breast."  ...which of course lead to her denial, which lead to him insisting, which in turn lead to her proving it.  You get the idea.  Omar saves some of his best material for when you co-habitate with him.  And this type of material just keeps coming.  In fact, two years of living with him was not enough to witness all of his quirks.  I knew that Omar had an obsession about washing his hands, but last night was just too much.  I couldn't stop laughing.    First of all, he was doing his laundry while we were watching TV.  So every few commercial breaks, he would go to the laundry room to move his clothes.  Every time he got back, he had to wash his hands.  When I took a bathroom break, I noticed that he had about four bars of soap next to his sink.  I asked him why and he told me that if he drops a bar of soap in the shower that it has to be relegated to hand washing duties.  There are too many chemicals on the shower floor.  I asked if he would reuse it if he had just cleaned the shower, to which he gave the same reply.  Secondly, he won't take a shower without his flip flops.  This is his own shower where NOBODY else ever sets foot.  He told me about how he had to use the restroom on the way back home from VA last weekend but couldn't because he was wearing his shower shoes and would have tracked that mess into his bath tub.  Third, and this is probably the best, he told me about another of his outstanding bathroom rituals.  He apparently has to line his toilet seat with toilet paper no matter what.  This is his own toilet!!  He's been doing it since he was a teenager.  This really used to get under Andrew's skin since they shared the cost of toilet paper and it was obviously being consumed at a rapid rate.    So if you ever meet Omar, you'll instantly like him...I guarantee that.  But don't mention any of this stuff to him.  He'll tell you eventually.  Plus, he'd kill me if he knew I was writing about this online.

       urlLink CNN.com - Kerry names Edwards his running mate   I think this is a good idea.  I think McCain would have been a better selection, but there's no way he's going to associate himself with the Democrats.  He wants to be president one day, which requires party backing, which requires him to not alienate the republicans.  That's why you saw him sliding closer and closer to the republicans as the democrats tried harder and harder to woo him away.  Edwards is a good pick for  urlLink Kerry .  He balances out the hardcore liberal image that the Bush administration has been trying to paint on Kerry.  I think that he will strengthen the Kerry ticket (which is completely rediculous considering that the VP has the least job responsiblities of all elected officials), so I'm glad he's on board.   "I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, Straining at the start.

      To continue a past line of thought, and bare with me because it's 1:30am and I just got in to Northern Virginia after a 5+ hour drive...  I was wondering why there are no documents that succinctly describe the problems faced by the current administration (and by administration, I obviously mean President Bush and his group of merry cronies).  After discussing it with a friend from NC, I have to come to the conclusion that the Republicans don't want such a record circulated.  Maybe this is obvious to most, but please stay with me because I lean toward naive.    Obviously, controlling knowledge controls opinion, and the republicans need control more than ever.  I really look forward to the presidential debates to see how Bush tries to spin his first four years in office.  I mean, what has he done for us as a nation?  I can see some sort of weird television internal monologue thing now...   In Bush's stupid cowboy twang:  "Well, first of all, I'm the elected president, which means that the simple majority of people liked me in 2000."  --  WRONG    "I passed the biggest medicare reform ever -- something not even your beloved intern molester could do."  --  And your consituents can't even figure out how to use it.  A medical system that exists to make a profit will never provide adequate health care to those who truly need it.    "Tax cuts.  They seemed to help."  --  Yeah, they helped your buddies, "the haves and have mores" while helping to build the deficit back up to where your daddy left it.    "Okay, forget domestic issues then.  Let's talk foreign policy.  I pulled out of all those stupid treaties.  We don't need our pollution or ability to shoot down missiles governed by international agreements.  We're our own country and we answer to no one."  --  Way to start out strong.  Now everyone's pissed at us.    "My hallmark will be fighting terrorism.  I'm really kicking some behinds."  --  Okay, so this stuff wasn't even on the radar screen until 9/11.  You didn't even meet with your anti-terrorism staff until after that horrible day.  Since then you have completely botched the attach on Afghanistan, letting the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden slip away because you couldn't afford to commit troops to that country for fear of not having enough for your real objective...    "And this Iraq war has been great for the war on terrorism.  My long term strategy to convert the evil-doers to an axis of democracy is going to pay off."  --  Uh, huh.  So this is your strategy.  Come in, remove an already teetering, toothless enemy who thwarted your daddy, and then leave a standing army in the midst of some of the holiest sites in all of Islam?  This is supposed to end the problems of the middle east?  Did anybody tell you that the reason Osama Bin Laden is flying planes into buildings is because there was a standing US army in Saudi Arabia?  Now you've inserted a cardboard cutout government, propped up by a US military that is growing more and more weary of an increasingly violent insurgency?  I can tell you had a plan for bombing and taking control of this land.  What was your plan for after that again?    "Okay, enough about my cowboy ways.  You must realize that I've created over 2 million jobs over my administration's term."  --  But how many did you lose in the first place?  And I'm sorry, but the "job starts" are not what we need.  How many part time jobs does this number include?  And just the fact that everyone's unemployment checks have stopped does not mean that less people are unemployed or under-employed.

       urlLink CNN.com - U.S. leak 'harms al Qaeda sting' - Aug 9, 2004   This is so idiotic.  Regardless of whether or not the White House used the threat warning for their own political reasons, they really screwed the pooch on this one.  I don't understand this stupid threat level scale.  It seems to me that its only purpose is to scare Americans into believing that Bush and Co. can protect us.  The fact of the matter is, I don't really need to know what specific buildings are threatened because I can't do anything more than cower in a corner somewhere hoping that the intelligence is accurate this time.    What they  should  have in place is a simple communication hierarchy for the powers that do have the authority and the means to affect local security.  When they discovered that the financial buildings in New York, Washington DC, and Newark were under threat, those towns and the owners of those buildings should have been warned directly.  There was no need to raise the threat level publicly.  Because then you need to justify it because it looks like you're trying to give the sitting President a bump in the polls.  Which leads to exposing a sting operative, which kills your chances for completely unraveling a major al Qaeda cell that is actively plotting to commit mass murder in the US.  What idiocy!

      Rachael was at a "girls night in" last night so I decided to see what the old gang was up to. I met Ken at his swank apartment in McLean and we headed in to a bar called Blue Martini in Georgetown. The plan was to meet up with Mike C, Christy, Chris, and Kuang, who, being who they are, were over an hour late.  This place was just recently written up in the  urlLink Post  as being a kind of lounge where a young, hip crowd sip on martinis and listen to pounding electronica. I found the description to be largely accurate, but the crowd was a bit strange.  The place was small, with a few low lying tables scattered throughout. Ken and I grabbed one despite the bogus sign marking it as reserved. The din of the electronica made conversation next to impossible, but we struggled through it. My voice is suffering for it this morning, though.  Mike C and the gang eventually made their appearance. I'm not trying to get on their case for being late as they had a much more logistically complicated journey than I. I just think it's funny that you can pretty much bank on this group running anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour late.  Mike was standard Mike, uttering his usual "you are the man" type philosophy to Chris after downing a few blue star martinis. I can't say marriage has changed him that much as he and Ken spent a good portion of the night studying a nearby "latin woman" (as he liked to call her) shake her barely covered rear.  So upon getting Mike completely trashed, we headed over to Johnny Rockets to get some burgers and allow Mike to completely berrate Chris for "not getting laid by the latin woman." This type of conversation lead me to wonder if Christy will ever let Mike go out with his fraternity friends again. We'll see.

       urlLink Five teams that fit title mold, three that don't   Are you kidding me? If that wasn't the all time jinx for Virginia football, I don't know what is. Seeing Virginia put in the same class as (defending co-national champion) USC, (perennial favorite) Oklahoma, and (SEC powerhouse) Georgia is something I did not expect. I can understand how West Virginia might slip into this list. They were a fun team to watch, especially when they completely humiliated Virginia Tech on national television last year. Plus, they have nobody in their conference to contend with them, and their toughest out of conference game is Maryland (at home).  Virginia on the other hand, does not have it so easy. Yes, we have a relatively weak out of conference schedule this year: Temple, Akron, and Syracuse. But our conference schedule is going to be murder. Clemson, Florida State, Maryland, Miami, Georgia Tech, and Virginia Tech are all strong teams that will likely end up in bowls games next year. To win a national championship, Virginia would need to beat all of these teams, a tall feat to say the least.  One issue listed in the realities of title teams is that you need game breakers on both sides of the ball. I'm not sure we have that on offense yet. Marques Hagans is a spectacular athlete, but I'm not sure he's ready to be "game breaking." Wally Lundy and Alvin Pearman are above average backs, but I'm not sure they're ready to take over games. And I don't think we can depend on Heath Miller (the tight end) to take over. Or not. Defensively, we're solid. The entire front seven could be considered "game breaking." I'm anxious to see how the secondary holds up, though.  I have faith. And I have season tickets, so I'm going to be there as a witness every home game this year. Last year's experience was fantastic. I hope it's the same this year.

      Reprieve over? I doubt it. My life is upside down right now. Last year around this time, I moved out of my apartment at Alexan thinking I was on my way to the greener pastures of Northern VA. I moved my stuff from my apartment into a moving truck and drove it down to Reston where I was promptly jerked back by my boss' boss. That was a good $800 lost, but more importantly it turned my whole life on its end. Most importantly, I had to scramble for a new place to live. I finally settled into a room where I had no AC in oft scoffed Central Islip. I was in a small bedroom in a run down house with nothing but my TV (with no Cable), my computer (with no Internet), and my clothes. That had to be the worst three months of existing of my short life. Things were so backwards that I started changing other things in my life. I started shopping at different grocery stores. I parked on the other side of the building at work. Why not change every last detail of my life?  Well now, a year later, I find my life equally, if not even more upside down than last time. Now, not only am I changing residences, I'm also changing my job location, I'm changing my job responsibilities, I'm hanging out with different people, I'm buying a house, and my Grandfather's getting remarried. Yeah, that's right. My Grandfather's getting remarried. I'll tell you about that a little later. To the point, nothing is the same in my life as it was just two short weeks ago. And that's okay. I have to go through this chaos to get what I want -- a nice, relaxed life in the great Commonwealth of Virginia. And you'd better believe I'm going to enjoy it after the dust settles. Wouldn't you?
