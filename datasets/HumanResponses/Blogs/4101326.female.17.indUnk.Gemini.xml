      No, i'm not in preschool, i'm a senior. But this blog is gonna be about school and school hasn't started yet. In some ways i guess i'm looking forward to it, but don't tell anyone cause that would totally ruin my reputation. Soon it's gonna be time to dig out all my black and start with the eyeliner. I'm also debating whether i should dye my hair black or not but i don't think i'm gonna because i really like my natural hair colour *well...ok...slightly enhanced hair colour* My mom says i'm gonna have alot of clout this year since i'm a senior. I wunder if she's right. I don't really think so but maybe i will. That would be cool if everyone like, worshipped me since i'm graduating. I picked all my courses for this year. Its gonna be alot better than i thought it would be. Since my schedule is so messed up, advanced mathII/calc and speech/health were in the same period and we couldn't move anything anywhere else. So now i take half a year of Advanced Math II and half a year of health. I get to skip calc and speech. Anyways...this is really boring, so i'm gonna go. And i probly won't update this one till school starts. So, my invisible non-existent readers, you will just have to wait to hear more from me...or you can check out my other blog...its slightly more interesting.

       Hey...i don't really know what to put cause this is my very first blog, but someone told me that this is like an online journal, so i dunno...maybe i'll reveal all my deepest, darkest secrets on here...or then again, maybe not. Cause who knows who is reading this? there could be a psycho stalker and i wouldn't even know it. i've never had a psycho stalker. i wunder what its like...?

        I got to go out with my friends last night! It was so nice to get out of the house. And i got to see josh and amanda and i hadn't seen them for what seems like years. actually, now that i think about it, it has been about a year since i'd seen either of them. sux, kinda. But anyways...yeah, shawn came and picked me up and i hadn't even been sure if they were coming cause he hadn't been able to get ahold of them but i went out to his car and there they both were and i was so happy to see them. And so we started driving to the theatres and amanda decides that she needs to air out her feet or something, so there i am sitting in the front seat, and all of a sudden there's this white foot right next to my head. Talk about a heart attack! They all seemed to think that it was funny that i'd almost experienced massive heart failure. hmph. And then josh decided that he would play around with shawn's seat...while shawn's still driving. I swear, it was totally a miracle that we reached the theatres alive. And then we go in and cruise the mall for awhile then go in and find out seats. Turns out Little Black Book isn't the best movie to take guy friends too. The part where she goes to the gynacologist(sp?) was especially mortifying. But i think it was worse for the guys. The ppl that were behind us were watching us more than the movie i think cause they kept laughing whenever shawn or josh would do something funny. Kinda weird. And then after the movie we hung out outside the mall while amanda called her bf and josh went to get a soda *anyone that has ever tried to get soda outside our mall knows that there are two soda machines right next to each other and that one has soda and one has water and powerade* well...josh put his money in the wrong one...the one with the water...and then when he realized that it was the wrong one, he tried to get his money back and it wouldn't work, so he had to powerade. And he opened it and took one sip and almost gagged. and that was my Movie Adventure.

         I got in a big fight with lisa last night. BIG fight. And then after i blocked her, everyone that knows both of us were telling me that i am completely in the wrong and acting stupid and selfish. I dunno. Maybe i am. But i still think that i have a right to be upset. And i didn't apologize. And i'm not going to cause i don't think that i have anything that i need to apologize for. I think that she has a few things that she could say sorry for tho. But i just don't know what to do. I was up all last night trying to figure it out and i still haven't thought up a good solution. I don't even know whether or not i want this friendship to continue. I have alot to think about. I did, however, upon erin's advice, send lisa an email explaining why i was angry and hurt. I don't know if she'll understand. She sure wasn't acting like it last night. So i dunno. I'm very confused right now.

        Hey          I went school shopping on friday. Its the first time i've been shopping in forever. And since i was buying my own stuff and its my last year in school, i decided that i wasn't gonna spare any expense. I got the pretty pencils that i've been wanting for a year and these really cool flat highlighters and some really pretty pens with awesome ink colours. And then we went to the mall and i got two new black short skirts and a couple new shirts and 2 pairs of sunglasses cause i have developed a love for sunglasses. And i almost forgot...i got the most awesome hair gel...its colored!!...I got red and purple and tried them out last night and then tried to wash them out cause i didn't want it to get all over my pillow, but now all of it came out...so now i have streaks of pink in my hair...not cool streaks...yucky streaks. Still...its soo cool. I'm thinking about getting my hair cut real short so that it'll work good on my hair. Right now my hair's too long to do anything with. Anyways...thats my Shopping Adventure.

        Ok...i know i know...3 posts in one day...but this is the last one, i promise. and its not even gonna be real long. Just gotta record this for posterity's sake. My dad took us to Dairy Dip for ice cream and i was standing there with megan waiting for my food, when who should drive up to the light but...you guessed it...nick! I saw his truck but i didn't wave or anything cause i like to feel like i'm not desperate even tho i am. Plus he had a friend with him and he can be a real prick around his friends. So anyways...i didn't wave and i hadn't looked at him while we were standing there and the roads were wet cause its been raining all day and the light turned green and man, he revved the engine then hit the gas, and the wheels spun and then he just peeled outa there. And i think that he was showing off for me! Such fun! i luv it when guys do that. Plus i really like nick's truck. He has an awesome truck. Anyways...i won't tell you the rest that i put in my actual diary cause someday *not real likely* nick might read this and he can't hear the rest of it. But yeah...that was my adventure of the day.       ok...little update...i talked to nick the next day and it turns out he waved to me and i just didn't see it. How cool, huh? Usually he doesn't even acknowledge my presence unless i wave first or whatever. And guess what else! It turns out that he really did go so fast just to get my attention! I feel so special!

      Yesterday i saw the biggest baddest spyder there is. I open my window and there he is, the granddaddy of all spyders. Big ole fat thing with yellow and black...biggest one i've ever seen. I thought about catching it to make it my pet...but then i thought it might be poisonous, so i sent catie out to catch it...but she botched it up and lost him. growlies...i probly could have sold that baby to the pet store or something.

      Today i had to wake up really early and go to school to choose my courses. It really sucks waking up early. Then i had to sit in the gym for half an hour waiting for my mother to do her excercising. But the truly awful part was coming home. I've been wanting to attend public school for a long time, but my parents would never let me. Well, mother finally told me why today. Wanna know what the biggest reason is? They don't trust me with nick. They thought that he would be in my class at the school i would go to. They'r so dumb. I could have told them not to worry had they told me about it...he's graduated this year and even if he hadn't, he went to a different school. But my mom and i really got into it. And it seems that the real reason*she wouldn't admit this but it was clear to me* is that they don't trust my judgement enough. Its like they think that if they let my go to public school, i'll turn into a crack hoe that goes to every party and gets wasted. Its just so stupid. I'm very very angry with them. But the worst part was that my mom kept saying, "no, we trust you...its not that we don't trust you..." but that is what the problem is. GRRRR

      well...i just got like, THE bad news of the century. At least, it is to me. I was talking with my 'best friend' last night and what does she tell me but that she's gonna skip the 1st day of school! Wanna know why she's abandoning me to the mercies of the evil pseudos at my school?? Because she wants to hang out with her boyfriend. God, don't ya just luv having loyal friends?*a.k.a. evil bitches that liked you well enough when they had no one else but now that they do, they don't need you anymore* But that wasn't all...she also said that she wasn't coming that friday either...wanna know why? Cause she wants to 'go to a bible conference'*a.k.a. hang out with her boyfriend* So now i get to spend virtually the first week of school alone. So i have decided that i am gonna work my hardest to get my dad to let me transfer to a diff. school. One far away from this acursed place. Cause you know what...she might not need me, but i don't need her either. I'll be just fine on my own. Yeah...just fine...

        ok...now i think i'm ready to talk about school. Boring, i know, but this is my blog and this is what i feel like talking about and since there's really no-one out there reading this*i can tell from my lack of comments* it doesn't really matter. So anyways...as i was saying before i got sidetracked last time...as i walked thru the doors of the school, the familiar feelings of impending doom and depression started to overwhelm me. I felt my pseudo-gothness coming back to me in full force. I felt powerless to stop it. Luckily*i guess* for me, emily was there in her best form, so i managed to sort of forget that i was standing in the school and just focused on her. I mean, i still remembered that i was in school cause there were teachers walking around everywhere*one that i despise above all others~if you know me, you know who this teacher is~* and the physical was given in a classroom down near my typing class. I'm wundering tho if this school year will be like the last two. Or will it be different since its my last year. Will i begin to like the crowded halls and stuffy classrooms? Will i miss the teachers that i don't even like now? I know one thing i will miss. My Locker. I'm getting one of the awesome ones in the Senior Alcove. I've been wanting one of those ever since i saw them 2 years ago. And now i finally have my chance. I'm hoping that Bethany, Lisa, and I will get the 3 that are close together next to the stairs. Bethany and Lisa have always been beside me. I wunder if i'll miss having a locker to go to after every class. I know i'll miss having Lisa and Bethany nearby. Hopefully they won't go too far tho. You know, its kinda funny...i don't even remember my 1st day at school. It was such a blur. I remember being terrified cause i didn't know anyone and i didn't know what to do. Lucky for me Bethany is the way she is, and she picked me and Amanda up and showed us around. Otherwise i don't think i would have survived. I wunder if i'll remember my last day or if that'll be a blur too? Scary thoughts. I'm just gonna stop now.

      Well...today i had to go back to school. No, not for the beginning of the school year already but for a sports thing. But as i walked thru those doors, i felt the familiar feelings of sleep-deprivation and depression overcoming me. I felt too conspicuous in my colourful clothing and i wanted to go change into something black. Black is my comfort colour. In it, i feel safe. It's part of my self-protection mechanisms. When i first went to school, i didn't know anyone. I felt very vulnerable, which to me means weakness and that is not something that i accept in myself. I found that in dressing in all black and picking clothes that looked goth, i could keep most ppl from approaching me. That could explain why i have so few friends. I blame my fear of social situations on my parents. We've moved around ever since i was little, and everywhere we went, we had to meet the neighbors and go to new churches trying to find one that was acceptable. I have a terrible fear of going anywhere that i won't know anyone...especially if i have to be by myself. I usually find some way to avoid going to those at all. However, my parents decided that my old familiar church wasn't acceptable for them, so now they are dragging the whole family from one church to the other, trying to find one that they think is good for us. Frankly, altho i see why they felt that our old church wasn't good enough and i think that they had some valid points, i think that it also had many factors in its favour, including the fact that we had a real church family there...not to mention that we were related to quite a few members of the church. It felt like we were accepted. And we were. The old ladies at my church were proud of all of us, you could tell...it was like we were their adopted grandchildren. All of our successes were talked about and we were congratulated. It was very close-knit and comfortable. Now all feelings of comfort have left. I dread the weekend for it means another new church to face and more ppl to stare at us and make all those wunderful remarks like "FIVE gurls?!?!..i feel so sorry for you!!" or "My, how Do you STand it?!" Do the ppl that say that think that we can't hear them? Its so rude. But oh well...builds character, right? If thats true, then i should have lots of character by now. And i had a whole different point to make when i started writing this, but i got sidetracked. Sorries.

       Hey           I thought i'd give you a play-by-play of what i've done today but that really wouldn't take that long. All i did was get up at 1:30 and read The Jungle till 6:00. Then i went to the library with mother, which is where i am now. So there you go...that is my life. I have decided that another step in my quest for self-improvement will be to give my room a major overhaul cleaning. Cause i haven't vacuumed or dusted for who know's how long and frankly, i just can't stand it anymore. I did most of it last night cause i had insomnia. I revamped the bookcase *i need another one cause i am, yet again, out of space* and alphabetized some of them...yeah i know...obsessive compulsive, what can i say. Then, i did the Unthinkable. I cleaned out under my bed. lol. No, it wasn't that bad, altho it wasn't exactly a pretty sight either. But i have decided that from now on, my life will be organized with everything put in its nice little slot. Yeah, nice thoughts huh? wunder how long they'll last...            And there you have it, folks...another DAY IN THE LIFE OF MELISSA

       Hey            I read about half of The Jungle. I would not reccomend that anyone ever read that book. It's totally disgusting. I stopped when i got to the part where Jurgis bites someone's face off. Kinda turns me off when ppl turn cannibal. And i am now debating turning vegetarian. Now i see why some ppl decide that they never want to eat meat again....just think if they were still doing the things to meat that they are doing in that book. Its just soo gross. I almost didn't eat my hamburger for supper. But i was kinda hungry, so i decided to run the risk of getting half-rotten meat that was filled up with tons of scraps of spoiled meat and nasty chemicals. I don't see why thats a Great American Classic. I mean, sure, it started a reform in the meat packing industry, but who really wants to read about meat that is spoiled and dropped and bled into and ppl getting dumped into the lard bins and getting left there?? YUCK!! the teacher said that we might not want to read Grapes of Wrath or Uncle Tom's Cabin cause we might find some of the stuff offensive, but she might have warned us about The Jungle. I had no clue it was gonna be that bad. Maybe i'll sue the school for millions of dollars for subjecting me to that with no warning...

         Aloha              Time to update you on my self-improvement efforts. I had a Great Adventure yesterday. Lets just say, they didn't go quite as i had planned. We were gonna start out at like, 8:30 but SOMEONE forgot to wake me up so i woke up at 12 and then my sister balked until 3:30 and then we finally started out. It was soo awful...the sun was beating down on us and the pavement was melting...seriously...there was like, little bubbles in the tar...thats how hot it was. I thought i was going to die. We only ran one mile and then we walked another to my mom's work and then just caught a ride home with her. But i almost didn't make it. I felt like i had been hiking thru the desert for days and days and not getting anywhere. But then we got to 7-11 and we got slurpies..yummy...thats the only thing that kept me going...i do luv slurpies. So anyways...thats my big adventure. And when we met momma at the library, i went in and checked my reading list for school and i have to read a Great American Classic. So i checked to see how many we have in the library...lets just say its very very sad. I found maybe 1/2 of the books on the list. But luckily, i only have to read one. I checked out 6 of them...i'm gonna read them and find out which one is the most interesting...i really liked My Antonia cause thats just a really good book, but i'm thinking that after i read The Jungle, that'll be the winner, cause that could be a really gruesome book report. I mean, this book is supposedly so gross that it caused a major reform in the meat packing industry. How awesome can you get?? I stayed up till 1:00 reading...i do that alot tho cause i'm just a little bit of an insomniac. And i came home and my dad had made the best lasagna i have ever eaten!! mmm...soo yummy...and he made up the recipe all by himself. I'm gonna see if there isn't some kind of Noodle Contest i can enter him in so he can get famous for his delicioso recipe. The only bad thing is that its soo good you don't want to stop eating it. ever. and that is not good for my new self-improvement resolutions. but oh well. Cause its just so yummy i don't even care. And thats all i can remember that i was gonna write yesterday, so tis The End.

         Hey               This is fun having a blog...don't ya just luv sayin that...blog...that has to be the greatest word out there. anyways...still don't know what to write...hmm...i could tell you about my latest self improvement resolution. kinda boring, but deal with it. I tried on some of my skirts for school today and they didn't fit and i was like "NOOOO" so now i have determined to diet and excercise. fun fun.:( i'm gonna drag my sister with me tho...then when she's gasping for breath before i am, i'll feel a little bit better.lol. and i'm only gonna eat lettuce and other rabbit foods until school starts. *yeah right...this is just in my dreams...probly by tomorrow i'll be pigging out* My dad told me that the best way to get in shape fast is to run long distance, so now i get to run four miles...it'll be up one hill and down the other side...up one hill and down the other side...over and over and over again. One of the curses of living in WV. soo much fun *major sarcasm, in case you missed that* Anyways, i'll end the boredom there, cause i just read it and i almost made myself fall asleep. Byes
