       As an addition to BBC's weekly Middle East pictures series, BBC News Online would like you to send them pictures of your city. Every week a different city will be chosen - this week they are asking for images from the Egyptian capital, Cairo.   Send images of your experience of Cairo - your everyday life, your favourite view, the people where you live or interesting things you have seen that you would like to share with the world.   The best photos sent to BBC will be put into a weekly photo gallery, so please send your name, where you live and some brief details about the picture you have sent.    Photo Subjects:   Ideally you should aim to take a variety of photographs - it's a good idea to plan the story before you start. A good first photo would be one that introduces the subject to the readers.   Makes sure you take some close-up photos as well as some wider pictures to show the subject's environment but remember to include something in the foreground to add impact.   When you take the picture, remember to look up or down to see what's around you. You might get a better shot if you kneel, or find a position to look down from.   The completed photo essay will have no more than 10 photographs, but you can send us more to choose from. Make sure you have permission from anyone pictured before submitting the photographs.    Words and Captions:   Each picture will need a caption.   Who, what, why, where and when is a good place to start when gathering information for the caption, but where possible quotes from those pictured and a description of how you are feeling will help bring the essay to life.   We don't need many words - no more than 40 per picture.   E-mail them to  urlLink yourpics@bbc.co.uk  &nbsp; or visit   urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2780295.stm  &nbsp;  -----------------------------------  for the latest Egyptian news check:   urlLink http://www.el-shella.com
