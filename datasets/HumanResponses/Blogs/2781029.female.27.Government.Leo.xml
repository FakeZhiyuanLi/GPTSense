      Energy Bill Woes  Being a "flack for the oil industry" as John calls me, or an advocate for energy producing small business owners, as I call myself, I'm quite alarmed by  urlLink this turn of events  on the Hill today.  Personally I think that jackass in New Hampshire, John Sununu ought to be embarrassed for taking campaign funds from small oil and gas producers less than two years before his vote on the energy bill in November to kill it.  Even though I'm an ardent conservative, you'll never hear me say another good thing about him again.  Also, I think they should just take out the MTBE waiver (since that's the major stumbling block), even though if people actually educated themselves on the issue they would realize that it makes sense to include it since MTBE, by it's nature, is not a flawed product.  Oh, woe is me.  --J of J Pickle fame

       In case you were wondering how the Constitution might be amended:   urlLink Salon.com News | How the Constitution could be amended  The link doesn't explain how the states would ratify the amendment after getting a 2/3 majority vote in the house and senate...However, let's hope that this anti-gay amendment doesn't get that far. The article also notes that an amendment to give DC congressional members was never ratified by the states after passing the house and senate. Where is the love? I guess the thought of Marion Barry in Congress killed that amendment's success. NW

       Take This Seriously, Please   After careful consideration and an extremely long conversation last Saturday night about my bet with Kris, I have received some great feedback on what I should subject Kris to when I win the Kevin Smith $15 million bet.  To begin, these suggestions may be heavy on the  urlLink bacon  content, but this is because Folks In The Know claimed that there is no food that cannot be improved with  urlLink bacon .  This included chocolate ice cream.  So this started me on my quest to not only prove these Unnamed People Wrong but also inflict the most heinous of cuisines on Kris.  So what I came up with are the following:  Bacon Cupcakes With Bacon Infused Icing Oatmeal Bacon Cookies and finally, the winner  urlLink Lime Jello  With Suspended  urlLink Bacon Bits  urlLink    Any other entries will not be turned away, bacon infused or otherwise.

"JULIEN MACDONALD, one of London's biggest fashion names, admitted that he may decided to show in Milan next season. "There just aren't the facilities to keep the top designers here," he said. "The government needs to give the British fashion industry more funding. I am the one who stayed but if I don't get the international press and buyers, I will show in Milan next season."

       Trend Alert   I know I've been slacking off on my observations of fashion week but I have noticed just a few things.  First of all, I was disappointed in New York fashion week (part of the reason why I didn't have much to say).  Diane von Furstenberg was abyssimal, Michel Kors didn't wow me like he normally does and even my go-to guy, Oscar de la Renta didn't give me much.    However, I've noticed some trends shaping up.  The first one I've noticed is a little fur shruggy thing.   urlLink Kors did them ,  urlLink Carolina Herrera did a variation ,  urlLink Julian MacDonald did them .   urlLink Diane did several.     Another trend is that  urlLink 80's business suit blouse with the big bow in the front .  Look at  urlLink Marc Jacobs ,  urlLink MacDonald ,  urlLink de la Renta .  I think London Fashion Week is shaping up to be the best.  But that's only because Milan never agrees with me, Paris is never very wearable and New York has already disappointed me.  I'll post more later, including my favorite London shows.  J.

       Jersey Madness   So, I know this falls outside the realm of this blog, but I must get some feedback on this.  About six months ago, my dear friend Kris and I were enjoying a tipple at a  urlLink Capitol Hill Watering Hole  when we started talking about the public catastrophe that is/was Bennifer.  I made a prediction that Jersey Girl, their second publicity vehicle would tank just as Gigli did.     We decided to place a wager on this.  He argued that since it's a Kevin Smith movie, it has a built-in fan base.  I said because it's an Affleck-Lopez movie it will not spread past the built-in fan base.  We settled on $15 million opening weekend.  For every million the movie goes over that sum, I will eat one  urlLink chicken wing .  For every million less than that sum I get to subject him to  urlLink some equally disgusting food item.   Tell me.  To what should I subject my dear friend Kris?  J. Nizzle

       Are My Boys Scared?   I'm normally a political pessimist and always assume the worst for my party.  So lately I've been in pretty high spirits, with that freak Dean doing so well, Michael Moore doing a disservice to his party, and the general strength of my man, W.  But lately I've seen some irratic behavior from the guys in the West Wing, that is starting to make me think they might be...um, scared of something.  Their behavior this week has not been consistent with the well oiled political machine I've gotten used to seeing.  First look at  urlLink this,  and then look at  urlLink this.   Berating a Hill staffer (I'm dying to know who it is)?  Releasing pathetic dental records?  If that's the best documentation they can release showing his service in 1973, they've got problems.  By showing they are scared, it's making me scared.  But, better for this nastiness to come out now, rather than post-Labor Day.  Posted by Jeannie

       Gender Double Standards   I know, I know, it's a tired topic, but every now and then I feel like I need to take up the cause of men.  Mainly because I really like men, and don't like to see them bullied.  So over the weekend I saw an article about  urlLink this tee-shirt  and was appalled.  If a young man wore a shirt like this to school he would be sent home, and probably suspended (assuming the subject gender is girls).  And now I see that not only does this company sell this shirt they also market it with  urlLink a really funny, irreverent game  for girls to play.  However, I'm also mad at the Grammys for allowing Justin to attend the ceremony but telling Janet she better stay home.   Nick, what do you think of this stuff?  Jeannie

       Lieberman at 53%   So a friend of mine  urlLink who shall remain nameless , sent me  urlLink this link  to figure out who matches up to your presidential vote best.  I was pleased to see George Bush came in first with me, although I was kind of surprised he got 100% since my stance on gay rights is different from his, but I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw that no Dems got a passing grade.  The closest Dem was Lieberman with 53%.  It's not surprising that he came in second, since he ran his campaign to get the Independent vote, but all he succeeded in doing was alienating everyone.  He was a combination of the worst parts of the GOP and the worst parts of the Dems.  He wanted to censor music but he also wanted to take back the tax breaks.  He reminds me of the kid in third grade who raises his (or her) hand and requests more homework and also tattles on you.  Good riddance.

       New Favorite Republican OR Favorite New Republican    urlLink Ralph Hall (D-TX)  had long been my favorite Democrat in Congress.  It goes back several years when he told a packed hearing room that he believed in drilling in cemetaries if it meant finding more domestic sources of oil and gas.  But now it seems he's my new favorite Republican since  urlLink the septegenarian cutie  switched parties last month.  Granted he only did it to save his redistricted butt in Texas, but hey, at least he didn't pull any punches with House leadership:  "When I decided to switch parties, I didn't call anyone. I didn't call the president or the speaker. I didn't even tell my wife - which was a mistake." - Rep. Ralph Hall, R-Texas, talking to reporters about his decision last month to leave the Democratic Party and become a Republican.  Regardless of the party, he still is heads above his competition for Funniest Member of Congress.  Jeannie and Ralph Forever

       Bridesmaid Pickle   So I'm in a pickle with my sister's pending nuptials.  This is the dress she has pick(l)ed out for us and I don't know exactly what to do about it.  If you think that this dress looks like a Charlie's Angels Pool Cover-up, let me know.  If you think it will be a cute trendy bridesmaid dress that will flatter the pants off me, let me know that too.  I'm love some feedback....     J Bridesmaid

       MTBE Out   Looks like Congress took my advice from last week, on this blog.  This from an article in Environment and Energy Daily today:  "The Senate appears ready to call the House's bluff on the energy bill as Senate leaders yesterday outlined a plan to delete the legislation's safe harbor language for the fuel oxygenate MTBE and slash its $31 billion price tag...Yesterday's announcement marks the first time Senate energy bill negotiators have publicly acknowledged they cannot muster enough votes to overcome a filibuster over product liability protection for producers of methyl tertiary butyl ether, known as MTBE."  Now if I can just get them to agree with me on ANWR we'll be all set.

       NERD ALERT!   urlLink Scientists calculate how high heels can go  Sex and the City stars stay upright because h = Q.(12+3s/8) say scientists The Q variables are: p – the probability that wearing the shoes will help you 'pull' (in a range from 0 to 1, where 1 is pwhooar and 0 is stick to carpet slippers). If the shoes are a turn-off, there's no point wearing them. y – the number of years experience you have in wearing high heels. As you become more adept, you can wear a higher heel. Beginners should take it easy. L – the cost of the shoes, in pounds. Clearly, if the shoe is particularly expensive, you can put up with a higher heel. t – the time since the shoe was the height of fashion, in months (0 = it's the 'in thing' right now!). One has to suffer for one's art, and if the shoes are terribly fashionable, you should be prepared to put up with a little pain. A – units of alcohol consumed. If you're planning on drinking, be careful to give yourself a little leeway for reduced coordination.  -NW

       A Passionate Dispute   My friend Kris sent  urlLink this to me this morning .  Speaking of passionate disputes, I'm happy to report that we have finally settled on the terms of our wager on Jersey Girl.  I don't know what rock he's been living under but he hasn't seen any of the ads for the movie and thusly thinks he is going to lose the bet.  If he does in fact lose the bet, he will eat a single shot of bacon infused lime jello for every million dollars short of $15 million.  If the movie makes more than $15 million opening weekend I will eat a single chicken wing per million up to a cap of $30 million.  I secretly think that it could go over $30 million opening weekend.  Nothing else good is opening that weekend, and it's a romantic comedy which means it's a date movie.  Woe is me.  J.

       MLK Library plight  I'm concerned that the DC government is going to allow the MLK Library designed by Mies Van der Rohe to be demolished. These concerns were prompted by an evening news piece discussing Councilman Orange's efforts to scuttle the Mayor's nomination of developer Robert Levy to the DC Public Library Board. This was confirmed by a recent  urlLink Marc Fisher column  about the need to revitalize DC's library system. This paragraph alarms me: "With slots to fill, Mayor Williams chose Richard Levy, a Georgetown developer, and John Hill, the bookish former director of the D.C. financial control board. Levy and Hill have been working behind the scenes with the mayor on a new central library to be built on the old convention center site (along with a Smithsonian music museum and office and retail development.) The idea is to sell off the Martin Luther King Jr. library, gaining about $40 million for the library system."  This is a valuable building. It is on the  urlLink DC Preservation League's Endagered List . From the AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington DC: MLK Memorial Library 901 G Street NW built 1972 The traditional Miesian package is the great man's only work in the District. That the commission came from the city government rather than from a private client, coupled with the fact that giants such as Wright, Gropius, and Le Corbusier are completely unrepresented in town, says much about the low architectural aspirations of mid-20th-century corporate Washington. -NW

       Foster's Glass Canopy    The American Art Museum/National Portrait Gallery have been closed forever. Just when the Chinatown area has arrived, the museums' closure has been the missing piece in revitalization of that area. Foster's solution isn't very shocking and is very respectful of the architecture. Not even the columns compete with the elegant neoclassicism of the court. This is okay, if boring, since the Old Patent Office building is one of the best Federal-style buildings in the city. A woven hankerchief has landed on the court and will be a draw to the museums in the same way that Pei's glass pyramid increased attendance at the Louvre. The solution here is similar to Foster's solution for the  urlLink Great Court at the British Museum . Ideally, this project will have a similar latice of shadows cast on the walls and floor of the newly enclosed court.  urlLink WP: Smithsonian Picks Norman Foster to Design Cover for Old Patent Office Building's Courtyard   Foster is a world class architect with many prestigious and admired projects already under his belt:  urlLink Swiss Re HQ (AKA The Gerkin),   urlLink The Reischstag ,  urlLink Millennium Bridge ,  urlLink London City Hall . The Smithsonian commission raises the bar for Washington's architecture. -NW

       Conservatives and Gay Marriage   Nick has been blogging a lot about the recent gay marriage goings-on, but I finally found something on young conservatives (like me) who are "ambivalent" about gay marriage.  Personally, I thought I was one of the only conservatives left (besides maybe  urlLink Andrew Sullivan , although he might take issue with being called a conservative) who was supportive of civil unions.  Anyway,  urlLink here's a great article on how urban conservatives feel about gay marriage,  contrary to what Karl Rove and Ralph Reed may say.  J.  PS Nathan thinks the editor on that page is sporting the Tucker Carlson appeal...nice.

       Paris Fashion Week, A Little Late   OKay, I haven't been up on my fashion voyeurism as much as I wanted to be, but I have made judgments on a few of the key lines that I was really looking forward to seeing.  First off, Michael Kors still cannot do any wrong in my book.  I do think  urlLink Celine  was better this year that his  urlLink eponymous line.   What I love about Kors is that he puts his models in sunglasses.  It always looks so jet set and casual.  I love it.   urlLink Balenciaga  has incredible outerwear again this season.  I always love the jackets and some of the dresses are just lovely. Favorites:  urlLink This ,  urlLink this ,  urlLink this ,  urlLink this  and  urlLink this .   urlLink McQueen  once again is my favorite.  He gets better with every passing season.  He makes me swoon.  He's a genius.  Some  urlLink favorites   urlLink here,   urlLink here,   urlLink here,  and  urlLink here.    urlLink Stella McCartney  continues to disappoint.  I think basically she needs a better runway consultant.  Her pieces are good on their own, but she presents them on the runway is such a  urlLink cluttered ,  urlLink unflattering  way it's difficult to see  urlLink what she has going for her.   Some of the dresses are liked are  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .   urlLink YSL  was such a great way to end, although I didn't see much difference from his 2003 Winter line.  Velvet, satin, velvet, satin.   urlLink Andrew GN , was nice to look at but not as strong as his  urlLink Spring/Summer line.   These are just some random thoughts.  I'm gonna try to do the same for the other cities at some point soon.  J.

       Anything You Ask, Tucker...Just Not Hillary   I'm no lesbian, but if Tucker wants to make out with me and a woman of his choice, I'm game.  Just please, Tucker, not Hillary.     From Liz Smith:  'TUCKER CARLSON, the bow-tied conservative of CNN's "Crossfire" chats with Elle magazine this month, on the subject of women and sex. Carlson says "One area of liberal phenomenon I support is female bi-sexuality - this apparent increased willingness of girls to bring along a friend. That's a pretty good thing." What do women want, Elle asks Tucker? "They want to be listened to, protected and amused. And they want to be spanked vigorously every one in a while." He also admits if he had to spend his life as a woman it would as Elizabeth Birch, "formerly of the Human Rights Campaign because you'd be presiding over an organization of thousands of lesbians, some of them quite good-looking." (Folks, nothing you can make up is better than what people actually say these days!)     Who is Carlson's guilty fantasy bedmate? "Hillary. Every time I see her I think I could, you know, help . . . She seems tense."   Asked to choose between conservative talkers Laura Ingraham or Ann Coulter, Carlson believes "Laura would be less likely to hurt you. With Ann you could get bruised on the angles."   Tucker opines that it is best not to argue with a woman. "Most of the time you can beat a woman in an argument. But what do you win? Nothing. You get short-term pleasure followed by a lot of pain."   He also says, "I like women." Well, good luck getting them to reciprocate your Neanderthal feeling, kid.   J.

       Gay  Marriage Overview   urlLink Same-Sex Marriage Vaulted Into Spotlight (washingtonpost.com)  The Post has a very helpful overview of recent gay marriage events. I didn't realize that Mayor Newsom attended the State of the Union address and that is what spurred him grant licenses in SF: "The speech turned pretty dramatically when the president brought up the Defense of Marriage Act and quite unequivocally talked about defending marriage as between a man and a woman," Newsom remembered. "I started looking around as people were giving standing ovations and applauding and cheering wildly. . . . I thought I was on another planet."   It was also nice to have confirmed the idea that Bush was put up to his recent comments backing an amendment. One could tell from Bush's demeanor that he really didn't want to make a firm statement on this issue and was pushed to by Rove: "For weeks, presidential adviser Karl Rove had been assuring FRC conservatives that Bush would endorse a constitutional amendment -- when the timing was right. Administration officials say Bush's support came with an 'if necessary' clause." The explanation of the tactical maneuvers of both sides is also interesting. -NW

       urlLink  History of the Dill Pickle Club    Chicago social club, established in 1917, to provide an unconventional meeting-place for the uninhibited and free-thinking, including Socialists, atheists, anarchists and liberated women, lecturers and soapbox orators, artists, actors, playwrights, literary hopefuls, and a range of Bohemian types.  The Dill Pickle Club was founded by John (Jack) Jones, a former labor activitist, in 1916. Called at first the Dil-Pickle, the club was chartered in 1917 as a "non-profit organization for the promotion of arts, crafts, literature and science." One of Chicago's best-known Bohemian locales, the club became a free-speech forum, frequented by labor movement radicals, drifters, rebellious academics, literary figures, prostitutes, actors, tourists and left-wing artisans of all sorts.  To find the place, both the famous and infamous were exhorted to squeeze "Thru the Hole in the Wall Down Tooker Alley to the Green Lite Over the Orange Door." 22 Tooker Place was located just south of the Newberry Library on Dearborn Street, and a sign outside read "step high stoop low leave your dignity outside." Those who entered would find a variety of fare - lectures or debates on controversial topics, perhaps a play, even a dance or a swinging party, supplemented by coffee, tea, sandwiches, and bootleg whiskey. The atmosphere of the club was an enjoyable mix of the radical, the rough, the erudite, the creative and sometimes the inane. And there was always plenty of stimulating talk.  The "Pickle" was frequented by such literary figures as Carl Sandburg, Edgar Lee Masters, Maxwell Bodenheim, Ben Hecht, Charles MacArthur, Sherwood Anderson and Floyd Dell and many others. Besides the tough owner, Jack Jones, another mainstay of the club was Ben Reitman, lover of Emma Goldman. Noted Chicago doctors, professors and other local intellectuals were among the assorted lecturers, for throughout the twenties, Jack Jones and the Dill Pickle Club played host to all sorts of people.  As the depression progressed, the Dill Pickle's fortunes declined, and in 1932 tax difficulties caused its demise.  -Thanks CWB!

Nor should you go if you are a Bible-waving zealot hunkered down in a Family Research Council bunker, writing out checks to reelect Rick Santorum and praying that the president would take a little time out from pressing pins into his Osama bin Laden doll to get that Karl Rove Marriage Amendment passed."  urlLink Full Review  -NW

       The Cher, The Donald, The Domald, The Jeannie   I found  urlLink this column on nicknames  in my hometown newspaper.  I have a strange nicknamey name.  I was named after my grandmother Jean.  But my mother's name is Deane, so whenever we were in the same room together, there were too many "eans" so they gave me Jeannie (although for the first 6 months Momma called me Polly, and my uncle called me by my middle name, McVeigh (?)).  I've been pretty content with Jeannie over the years, it's served me well, I think it's kinda cute.  So why do people after they've known me for a while and have gotten a degree of familiarity with me shorten it to Jean? "Hey Jean!"  I hate Jean.  It reminds me of my grandmother.  Or people assume my middle name is Louise and call me "Jean Louise."  Maybe it's from  urlLink To Kill A Mockingbird ?  So my name is actually not anything "for short" but actually "long for" Jean.  And my last name has never had a ring to it like guys who are only called by their last names in high school.  My dear friend Mittendorff, was forever known as Mittendorff among her guy friends in college.  my last name doesn't roll off the tongue with such fun ease.  Do I need a nickname?  Momma calls me Bug, but that doesn't really count since my firends aren't going to call me bug and it has nothing to do with my name (and  urlLink I'm reminded of Uncle Buck  whenever anyone else calls me Bug).  I guess all I can do is hope that one day I'll be known as The Jean (like Donald) or just Jeannie (like Cher), but then wouldn't that have to be just Jean, since it's one syllable?

       I'm Finally Part Of The Most Wanted Demographic!   I was always so jealous of the Soccer Moms, the Single Guys, the AARP and all the other trendy demographics.  Finally I get my turn!  Single Women Voters!  However,  urlLink after reading this Salon article , I'm just reminded of how often I get steamed at women from Jane Magazine and Candace Bushnell who claim to represent my views.    First of all,  Karen Catchpole, senior editor of Jane  has this to say:  "It's not like they should start thinking 'let's do a mall tour because we're going to talk to women.'" She paused, and said with audible disgust, "By the way, I'm 100 percent sure that that idea has come up, and that's just offensive."   Then  Simon Doonan, creative director for Barneys New York  says this:  "The 'Sex and the City' single women are never going to take an interest in politics. They are so completely mired in fashion and style and self-indulgence. They have, maybe quite wisely, decided to center their entire lives on themselves. They're very inwardly focused; they make random attempts at caring about the world by going to yoga class."  Then  Elle editor in Chief Roberta Myers : As for how candidates could catch the eyes of single women, Myers said that in practical terms, "One thing the Kerry campaign could do is get John Edwards [as the vice-presidential candidate]." She was quick to add, "not just because John Edwards is cute. It's that he's got a magnetism, and you can hear the message a little more easily. It's true that you actually pay more attention to people who are compelling speakers and deft with language."  And then  New York magazine sex columnist Amy Sohn :  "[Kerry] should hire really good-looking men to stand outside the polling places in high-single areas," she said. "All the men should have sideburns and good breath. Any time they see a harried woman walking by in unreasonably high heels, they hand her a flier that says Choose, Then Booze...When I was single I always voted because I never had a date and it was one way to make the evening go by more quickly. Plus, it takes less time to vote than to masturbate, and the feeling of satisfaction lasts longer."   What I find far more offensive than the thought of candidates going to malls looking for women voters, is women who claim to speak to my views on politics saying that women choose a candidate like we choose a one-night-stand, and then compare it to masturbation.  No wonder candidates are listening.  J.

       Is She Finally Gone?   Looks like a fashionable men's clothing store in DC isn't the only thing that's tough to get off the ground, Nick.  Apparently  urlLink portly girls who give good head and sell ugly handbags  isn't a business model that, say,  urlLink Domenico de Sole  would follow.  I'm just glad that she might actually be on her way out for good now.

       The state of mens shopping in DC  If I were to open a mens clothing store in DC, it would fill a void for items that aren't available here. Sure, there is Saks where you can get all the high-end name-brand stuff that costs an arm and a leg and is super fancy. And then there is the local neighborhood shop,  urlLink Universal Queer , which leans a little too  urlLink International Male  for me. I would love a shop to carry these lines:  urlLink Yoko Devereaux  (check out the wiglets too!)  urlLink Unis   urlLink Nice Collective   urlLink Obedient Sons  Though I'm skeptical about whether there would be enough customers to support a DC store with these clothes.

       There Is No Sex In Clowning   According to Jenny Bayly, my only friend who has actually been to clown college, there is no sex in clowning.  No wonder there's nothing remotely funny about clowns.  They can't joke about the funniest topic in the world.  So imagine my surprise when I found this article about  urlLink "Spanky"  who obviously disagrees with that tried and true maxim of clowning.

       TREND WATCH: The Vaguely Ethnic Wail   This is  urlLink a great article  on the now cliched trend to add female ululating vocals to any epic movie.  Some great lines from the article for those non-Salon subscribers:  "Probably the oddest recent wail sighting came in Danny Elfman's score for "Hulk," which featured the jolly green giant skipping through the Nevada salt flats to a quasi-Arabian rhythm section and a spirited female screamer of dubious descent."  "Debney and other composers aren't going for accuracy at all costs. It has to sound good first. This is Pier 1 ethnicity; chipotle chicken sandwich ethnicity; and that's OK."  ""Troy" is rife with wailing, from battle scenes to funeral scenes to Brad Pitt showing his right butt cheek scenes."  "Apparently, somewhere on an Aegean beach, among throngs of extras in leather minis, a musical fad was trampled to death."

       Wedding Fashion Update: Rehearsal Dinner   I know nobody cares, but since I've been posting about  urlLink the hideous bridesmaid dresses  I've had to wear this season (like  urlLink the one for my sister's wedding  coming up this weekend), I thought I'd let everyone know that I've decided on something to wear to the rehearsal dinner.  It seems like every damn event this weekend is "black tie" (read: tacky) including the rehearsal, the bridesmaid luncheon, the overkill brunch, the Friday night BBQ, and golfing with the groom.  So I've decided that I'm going to channel  urlLink J. Lo at the  2003 Oscars  for the rehearsal dinner.  Anne will hate it but I love that look (how many times have I emoted on  urlLink caftan chic  in this space?) and the scarf I'm using is a gorgeous black paisley silk scarf my mom bought in Spain about 35 years ago, perfect!

       American Candidate   A guy I sort of know is running for President via the Showtime show  urlLink American Candidate .  If he gets enough supporters he will be on the show.  Let's all  urlLink vote  for him!  My friend Fred who told me about it says, "They'll pick 12 contestants from over 400 and Max has a good shot as he is a pragmatic quasi-libertarian candidate (he's currently a Policy Analyst for Center for Sound Economy) who has already competed in a real political race (Mass. State Legislature), receiving almost 35% of the vote. He only needs 500 support-clicks to be in the top 50 and "just" 7,000 to be in the top 12 so feel free to send to friends and fellow reality show afficionados."  Or you could go for the gay activist  urlLink Brad Bailey , also a friend of Fred's.

       Wholesomeness Versus Tackiness   I get stressed out when I think about swimsuit season and I personally think that over the age of 16 women look best in sexy one-pieces on the beach (rather than bikinis).  As much as I'd like to deny it, I don't look as good as I did when I was 16. Although, come to think of it, I had a swimmer's body back then.  Men look better with swimmer's bodies than women...maybe I shouldn't have been in a bikini back then.  Maybe I'd look better in a bikini now (after my yoga practice) than I did then.  Anyway, I think  urlLink this is an extreme  (thanks Kandy).

"I gave them both City of Night and said: "If you want to know the life of a street hustler, this is the place to start.'

       30 seconds of Magnetic Fields goodness from the new album out today:   urlLink I thought you were my boyfriend  I plan on purchasing this cd, titled I, as soon as I get off work today from Olssons. It is their first release in five years. Their last album was the 3-disc 69 love songs on indie label, Merge. This new release is on Nonesuch records which is the subsidiary of a major label so I am expecting the new album to sound more polished than the previous, home-recorded albums. Hopefully this will be a good thing, and one will be able to better hear the layered instrumentation that is a hallmark of their sound. -NW

       !!! were okay  Last night at the Black Cat. White Magic opened which is a high profile local group but as I expected, I wasn't that into them. Plodding chamber goth pysch or something. !!! sounded alot looser and raw than their recordings which made it more rockin' but also harder to enjoy the interplay of the instruments cause there are 7 of them. The lead singer was a total ham sort of like Mick Jagger but less sexy. It was funny to see white indie kids dancing to it. The lyrics were painfully simple, stupid and almost fratboy. But, if you were able to ignore that then it was fun music. The revved up version of their "hit" from last summer 'Me & Guiliani down by the schoolyeard' was missing the crispness and steady pace of the recording. And the transitions/bridges on all songs weren't as carefully developed as they could be. I don't plan on buying their new album or going to see them again. But I'm glad I went.  urlLink !!! homepage

       Kerry For Job Losses   How noble of Kerry to announce he wants to  urlLink raise the minimum wage  to $7 an hour all the while criticizing Bush for lost jobs in his term.  Says he, "If you're down at the bottom of the labor market, an increase of $3,800 a year can make a real difference to families struggling to put food on the table, struggling to pay the rent."  Sure, until this same worker's employer can no longer afford to pay him.  It's a simple fact: raising minimum wage will result in job loss almost immediately.  If employers can afford to pay ten people they'll hire 10 people.  If they subsequently can only afford 8 people, they'll lay off two.

       RIP, Grandpa Ronnie   Lots of people have asked me to comment on the blog about Ronald Reagan's death.  It's taken me a few days since I'm so very sad and still grieving.  I always said that I would be absolutely torn apart when he died and sure enough, even when it hit on Saturday I wasn't prepared.  I have been far more upset than I thought I would be.  Monday was particularly hard for me as I watched Nancy in California, her first public appearance, so frail and sad.  She reminded me of my own grandmother.    I'm just one of a million people who was too young to vote for him, even too young to be politically aware of what he was fighting for, and yet he still inspired me.  He was a cultural force.  A giant.  If people want to know why I'm so sad, it's because he was my hero.  Plain and simple.  And while I grieve for his family and for the fact that he is gone now, I also grieve for  urlLink the people who just don't get it .

       Salon Catania article provokes concern  Dear Mr. Catania, As an often odd-man-out, being a Republican in this city, I just wanted to write to you to beg you to remain with the party during this difficult time.  I just finished reading your interview on Salon.com and I agree wholeheartedly with everything you say in it.  The party has certainly betrayed you and I feel betrayed as well. (I take to heart any unnecessary meddling with the Constitution, especially when at odds with the principles of the party).  But as you say in  urlLink the interview , let's be worried about the next 40 years so that we do not end up losing the gay vote the way we lost the black vote in the 60's. Mr Catania, you have done so much to open up the political process in the Republican party to include and embrace gays because it is the true and right thing for us, as a party, to do.   Likewise, you've done so much to crack the Democrat Party stronghold on politics in DC and set an example for gay Republican office holders across the country.  You've done so much!  Please don't make it be for naught!   There is so much more to be done, and regardless of how Bush acts on this amendment issue, if we lose all of the gay voices in the party we will no longer have ANY voice to cry out when the party goes counter to it's principles.  I just wanted to voice my support of all that you have done for the party, and to tell you that you are not alone in this fight!  Please don't leave us now! Sincerely, Jeannie Mills Mt. Pleasant, Washington, DC   Additional J.Pickle comments  Axel Foley says: It's such an alarming article. NW says: Catania sounded pissed about outing gop staffers. i really dont think bush is v behind the amendment thing. he has been put up to it. Axel Foley says: I agree. NW says: most likely by Rove -you think? tho Catania wouldnt go there in the article. Axel Foley says: no, I think people put alot on Rove just because he's his political advisor on how to win.  I think it come from major fundraisers.  Rove knows this is politically stupid in the long term. Rove is just an easy target. NW says: So the people who talk to Rove about their concerns which Rove then synthesizes into strategy?  -Ralph Reed et al Axel Foley says: no, Rove is a numbers guy. He doesn't look at policy at all. He's like a Lee Atwater, pure strategy. As Catania says in the article, if you keep paring down the party, it leaves you with a core and nothing else. NW says: so if a certain percentage of Republicans need to hear strong words against gay marriage to secure their votes then... Axel Foley says: I think the religious right is trying to put it to Bush (and Rove that way).  And they are throwing tons of money at it.

       More Modesty, Please   Chrissy, ever so modest herself, has pointed out that  urlLink Wholesome Wear  has started a trend that just won't stop!   urlLink Ella, an eleven year old has requested  more modest clothing from Nordstrom Department Stores.  What I find most alarming is the response from Seventeen Magazine:   "We like to call this new girl Miss Modesty," said Gigi Solif Schanen, fashion editor at Seventeen magazine. "It's such a different feeling but still very pretty and feminine and sexy. It's just a little more covered up."  Why does an eleven year old need to look sexy?

       More of Bitsy's Bits. . . .  Well, I am happy to report that I did spy, with my little eye, a rather handsome lesbian couple last weekend.  Today at the market I passed on a rather garish handbag.  It was only EUR10, so I hope I don't regret passing it up.  One of the big crazes here is cartoon prints on bags, shoes and tee shirts.  This one had a very poorly translated cartoon with a woman crying on her girlfriend's shoulder wailing "I will never get him out of my eyes."  LOVE IT.    Cheap canvas belts in bright colors can be seen on every girl and even sometimes the boys. Such a simple concept, such a large fashion statement.  I have also noticed that these days the Italian's are very monochromatic.  That is, they pick a color and do it head to toe. If they have a pink tee, they have pink heels, and pink bag, and probably a pink scarf or something too.  So you see pink people, blue people, white people, etc.  I think the key is having lots of bags and shoes. . .  It's also election season over here.  I don't know Italian so I have to infer the candidates platforms from their photographs.  Mostly they are old white men, but I did pick up a flyer for a younger guy who made me think of DC's own Adam Eidinger minus the big nerd glasses.  No worries Jeannie, I'm bringing the campagin literature home.    Okay, off for a nap.  The Rotary Club is throwing a dinner for us tonight so it's going to be a late one. Last night we didn't eat dinner until about 1:30a, but it was a wonderful dinner with 60 people or so sitting around a big community table drinking lots o' vino. Even my dear mother had a wee nip.  More soon. . . B to the itsy.

       Travel Dispatch from Elizabeth in Italy  Ciao,  The town I am in is a lot like Annapolis minus the water, so there isn't much to do but eat gelatto and shop.  The Italians seem to loooooove underwear.  It's everywhere.  Wine and cheese too, as expected.  I haven't seen any gays or references to eBay as of yet.  As usual, my eyes are peeled.  I bought a few things at the market this week, but am pretty euro-poor so I mainly have to stick to eating gelatto.  I do have my eye on a bag from a shop called Pinko.  They don't have one in Alba, but hopefully I'll be going to Torino next week and can pick one up there.  It's just a canvas totebag that says PINKO BAG in sequins.  I don't normally worry about flashing brand names, but this pun is just too funny in English.  And, if anyone needs one of those fake plastic Birkin bags, they are che-e-e-ap here, only about $15.  You will all let me know.   And, on to the people.  They are all wonderful.  Tons of handsome Italian men, but none of them undressing me with their eyes as I'm in northern Italy.  And there is no university here so the people tend to be older or of the jailbait variety.  Oh, and what young Italian girls like as much as underwear are really tacky tee-shirts that say things like FREE SEX on them.  It's almost as if I never left home.  I was also hoping to splurge on a pair of trainers that one can only find in Europe, but the latest craze here is Nikes. Go figure. More later! Ciao,  Bitsy

       Pickle coaching   So this afternoon I went to an hour and a half career consulting session. I met with Marshall Brown who runs a small consulting outfit called  urlLink Marshall Brown & associates . I'm very glad that I went ahead and met with him. It's been something that I've been intending to do for almost a year.   I came out of the session with a list of things to work on in order to move towards getting a better job.   He put me to work on several things to do in the next week:  1. re-write my resume adding a "summary of qualifications" and short list of strengths to the top. Also use active verbs in the work experience section and describe things in a way that shows results and quantifies your accomplishments at work.  2. buy and read the book  urlLink Taming your gremlin   -this is because he sensed that I was too negative and was short-changing myself.  3. set up some volunteer work. I'm thinking about being a docent at  urlLink a museum , if they'll take me.  4. make a "mind map" that tracks all of my interests, options, skills, experience, etc. -this is basically a series of bubbles that contain lists that are connected by lines - i think.  5. sit down and sort through a stack of special cards that will help me asses my skills and abilities, likes and dislikes etc  (more on that later cause I don't have those yet)  6. Lastly, we talked about networking and setting up informational interviews instead of simply asking friends if they can help you get a job. The difference is talking to people about how they got their jobs and what kind of skills they have. Then, I  will see how I might learn from them to develop my own skills. This is also a better approach to then talking with others about what sorts of skills you may have. So, if you have any insight about how you landed your job or developed your job skills then  urlLink please send them in . I have to set up 2 informational interviews by next week.  I hope to update regularly on the blog about my job search.

       Turbo Conservative   So today some funny things happened when I went to the Whole Foods on P Street. I always enjoy the political volunteers who stand on the sidewalks of the city and ask you to sign petitions and whatnot. Invariably they are liberal activists and it's always fun for me to get a solicitation to "take a moment for Greenpeace" and then tell them politely that I work for the oil industry. The looks on their faces are always fun and I continue on my way. Simple pleasures. So today I was heading into the Whole Foods, picking up some last minute items for a dinner party tonight, and some guys were standing outside and one asked an older woman if she wanted to "help defeat George Bush." She gave him a dismissive look and said, "Lord, no I don't! I want to help him win!" I was ecstatic! I always assume I'm the only registered GOP in the district and all alone, but lo, there she was! The other Republican living in DC!    So then, I finished my shopping and upon leaving the same guy asked me if I wanted to "help defeat George Bush" and without thinking I said, "No, I'm turbo conservative." Turbo Conservative? What is that? If you don't know me that sounds ridiculous! My friends know that I tend to overuse certain words, "turbo," and "buster" being two of my favorites, but this dude had no idea what I meant by that. However, he gave me a forlorn look and for a brief moment I thought I saw a look of inevitable defeat in his eyes, so I guess he did understand what turbo conservative meant.

Last night she was at home with her son M. and his fiancé S. when A. and his brother stopped by with two trays of raw meat left over from the firehouse cook-out the day before. A said, "Fire up that grill, M. We cooking out tonight." D said, "Excuse you? You don't come over to somebody's house with no damn trays of RAW meat at nine o'clock at  night on a Sunday. You wanna get back with me? It gonna take a lot more than some nasty old  salmonella raw-ass chicken that been sittin in your trunk all day!" A's brother said, "Oh come on Gloria. Relax. Let's have a good time." Well. You can imagine what followed. "Gloria? Gloria? Gloria? Who the hell is Gloria? There ain't no DAMN Gloria up in this house! This is D's house! Always has been always will be. Don't forget it! Now get your damn ass of my house. Gloria? You must be crazy." A and his brother quickly left, followed by M and S. The meat, however, stayed. D called her bigqueen upstairs neighbor and offered it to him. "Mmmm" said Queenie, "You know I'll come down and take that fireman meat off your hands. Mmm mmm mmm."

The man was a gross  urlLink self promoter  who only looked out for himself.  The Duel is the least of his historical woes at this point.  And don't get me started on the Election of 1800!

Half was "come hang out at Banditos tonight" and the other half was "are you too busy to date me?" (She actually said that).  I haven't called her since Tuesday.  Last saw her Thursday.  So my question is: Is a bipolar DTR* voicemail ever appropriate?  I was trying to give this girl a chance because I decided it was really lame to dump her for her dolphin obsession."   *DTR = Define The Relationship

       Missing Tom Ford already  Images from the first mens collection for Gucci sans Ford are up. Caftan mania!! I know that  urlLink J. is a big fan  of caftans for women but I question their value for men. -particularly when they are paired with highwater pants and traditional gucci loafers. Yuck! -and the turtleneck/medallion/tux combos are pretty tragic too. John Ray: You're Fired!  urlLink See for yourself at GQ.com

       Double D. Dispatch  Ms. D went to Zanzibar last night with her future daughter-in-law S. and her girlfriends. She told me she called S. this morning and said, "If you hoochies think I'm going make this reglar, you crazy. Ain't no damn reason a grown woman need to be all up night on a Thursday drinking apple martinis and flirtin' with mens." "So you're going back next week?" "Oh you knows it, Boo."  and...  C. just called Ms. D over in the Guest House to ask her a (work related) question but she was talking to someone else. "Girl. Get the stiff out your hip. Mmm mmm mmm. Puh-lease. You mean to tell me that how she grinds? Ooooh child. I feel sorry for your man." "Who in the world are you talking to?" C. asked. "Star Jones. She trying to do a strip tease on the TV."

       Fashion On eBay   I've been getting most of my wardrobe on eBay for several years, but now it seems  urlLink everyone is catching on .  I hope this doesn't mean that all my bargains are going to dry up.  I just recently won  urlLink a vintage Ronald Reagan tee .   I feel terrible because from looking at the won items of the person I was bidding against, I think the guy was a true RR fan, like me.  But of course, in the end, nobody beats my swooping prowess.

       urlLink  Dem Dates     Here's a good example of  urlLink how tolerant  Democrats can be of differing viewpoints, and people unlike themselves. They have to date along party lines. I should know, I'm a recovering Democrat Dater.  They always tried to convert me.
