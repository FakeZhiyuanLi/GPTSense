       Almost the end of July.&nbsp; How is your summer going?&nbsp;   Yesterday I visited some Blogs on the Internet and picked up a nasty adware or spyware virus, which has disabled my Internet browser, closes open windows automatically, opens up pop-up advertising windows indiscriminately, and seems to keep reinstalling itself, despite my best attempts to delete any foreign files that I find in my operating system.&nbsp; Mind you, I am such an inept technophobe that I couldn’t differentiate a malicious virus from a harmless bug.&nbsp; None the less, as I am not the administrator of my computer at work, I have to wait until he comes back on Monday to access my computer remote, and reboot it after, hopefully, isolating and decontaminating my hard drive.&nbsp; What a nuisance.&nbsp; I was doubly surprised to find out that my networked PC did not even have any anti-virus software on it, thereby making it a perfect roaming target for this adware or spyware to attach itself to my computer, as I casually surfed the Internet.&nbsp; Apparently, the IT gurus in Moscow felt that the firewall on the server was safe enough.&nbsp; These days you don’t want to leave home without a little added protection.&nbsp; Eh, nudge, nudge, wink, wink.   However, thankfully my computer is still running, so I am able to keep on working on this bright and sunny Friday afternoon.&nbsp; Last weekend we took a cruise to Beirut and had a really great time with our Dutch friends.&nbsp; This weekend, my Russian colleague and his girlfriend and I will drive first to Nicosia, and then depending on our luck, we will pass through the main check point onto the Turkish side of the island and then proceed to the famous Famagusta Beach on the East side of the island.&nbsp; You cannot drive there directly, and Greek Cypriots and visitors have only recently been allowed to cross over onto the Turkish side.&nbsp; I hope I do not need a visa, being a Canadian?&nbsp; I know that I need one to visit Turkey?&nbsp; We shall see.&nbsp; However, assuming I do not have any problems, it should be fun to see that side of the island.&nbsp; If I do, I will, of course, take some good pictures, with my amazing reappearing camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   As you may remember, my apartment was robbed in Moscow.&nbsp; The thieves ram-sacked my apartment, turning all things upside down, looking for my loot, which they found, of course.&nbsp; First of all they found everything, and then they stole everything, that is, except for my new digital camera.&nbsp; The camera was inside my old rucksack.&nbsp; That knapsack is so beat up and weathered that I am sure they thought there would be nothing of value inside it and therefore they simply ignored it.&nbsp; They didn’t miss much else of value, so its not like they were in a hurry or anything.&nbsp; So happy days, my camera was preserved, along with all my photos on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Then in June, I was flying back to Munich for the weekend from Larnaca via Budapest.&nbsp; I had only carry-on baggage and my briefcase.&nbsp; However, the plane was full, and Malev Airlines insisted that I also check-in my luggage as it was quite heavy.&nbsp; Basically, I forgot about my camera in my bag.&nbsp; It was 03.00 in the morning, I was tired, and I guess I assumed that it was not a problem, as the luggage was locked.&nbsp; Needless to say, I was distressed to learn at home in Munich, that my camera was no longer in my suitcase.&nbsp; It is one of those dumb moments, when you cannot believe it, and you check a second time through the bag to make sure you did not miss on the first look through.&nbsp; No such luck, the camera was gone.   I telephoned Hungarian Airlines in Munich and reported the camera missing.&nbsp; The airline confirmed that I was not covered by their insurance, as they had no way to know about small, valuable items in luggage such as laptops, mobile telephones and such things as cameras.&nbsp; Still, I thought I might be able to claim it on my credit card insurance, if the airline didn’t reimburse me, and for that I needed a report from the police or the carrier that I reported it stolen.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Then a few weeks later the Hungarian airport police called to say they had found a camera and was it mine?&nbsp; Yes, we had reported the camera as stolen, and luckily I had written my name, address and telephone number on the inside of the camera case.&nbsp; However, the police spoke very poor English, and I cannot speak Hungarian.&nbsp; Therefore, I had a friend in Budapest contact and arrange to transfer the camera to him.&nbsp; He then mailed me the camera special delivery to Limassol, and a week later I had my camera back, with all my pictures still on it, and one of him and his family.&nbsp;   So, the amazing reappearing camera is back in my possession once again.&nbsp; It reminds me of a song we learnt in elementary school.&nbsp; ‘’The cat came back, it wouldn’t stay away, it was sitting on the porch on the very next day.’’&nbsp; I cannot remember anymore, but you get the idea.&nbsp; Never the less, I am being more careful now.&nbsp; If three times lucky, then in this case, perhaps third time unlucky, so I won’t push my good fortune, by leaving it lying around anymore.   I am, however, quite happy with the quality of the photos from my Olympus 750-C digital camera, and it is in many ways more practical than my 35mm camera.&nbsp; I can store up to 100-150 images on it depending on the quality of the photos.&nbsp; I usually shoot at high quality, which makes nice prints, and then downgrade the resolution for sending via email, as they are otherwise too large.&nbsp;   When we were hiking last year in Mallorca, and I did not have my new digital camera, I was taking pictures with my Pentax ME and another smaller automatic Olympus camera.&nbsp; I was using some old Fugi film that I had lying around the house.&nbsp; I took about three rolls before I decided to get them developed.&nbsp; I was so disappointed.&nbsp; The island colors were all washed out.&nbsp; I do not know if it was the older film or ‘the fast-tourist fotos in one-hour shop’ where I had them developed, as I have heard sometimes they do not change their developing solution very often and this can muddy the clarity of the prints.&nbsp; I have now switched to Kodak 200 film and I am much happier with the quality.&nbsp;   If I made one mistake, it is that the new Olympus 750-C quite large and bulky.&nbsp; That is because it has a 10x4 optical-digital zoom lens.&nbsp; This is very convenient, but adds weight.&nbsp; I can still put it in a jacket pocket, but I would prefer a smaller camera, which was thinner and lighter and that I could have with me at all times.&nbsp; For this reason, I still carry the 35mm automatic camera, and shoot film once in a while.&nbsp; The digital camera is also power hungry, so it is nice to have a back-up camera when I inevitably run out of batteries.&nbsp; I now have 3-sets of rechargeable batteries, but they take a long time to load-up and still do not last that long.&nbsp; A back-up camera is nice to have.   Now, in my rucksack I have one or two cameras, one or two mobile phones – one Russian SIM card & one Cyprus number – extra film, extra batteries, and if I am going to the beach, also my small radio and headphones.&nbsp; I am like a walking electronics store, and whatever else I happen to be lugging around with me at the time, like a book and The Economist to read.&nbsp; Same old, beat up knapsack, though.&nbsp; It is my lucky backpack.   Well, that’s all the news that’s news and possibly more, so will sign-off now.&nbsp; I am off to the beach for a swim, and then looking forward to the weekend.&nbsp; Take care and hope to hear from you next week.&nbsp; Ciao.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    urlLink Bill

       urlLink The fun never stops .    So anyways, I am on my home last Friday.  It is cold, dark and slippery.  The day’s previous snowstorm had buried us in the fun, fluffy stuff, and it promised to be a good weekend for skiing or just playing outdoors.  No sooner had the white layer started to settle, then the temperature shot up from deep in negative territory to around freezing.  All that glorious snow began to disappear or worse to transform its purity into a brown slush, that by Friday morning had turned piles of plowed snow at the side of road into running rivulets and then into sloughs.  I needed to jump from island to island of wet, slick pavement to avoid stepping into a deep mud puddle and pulling up a soggy foot.  No thoughts of skating on ice in Gorky Park’s winter wonderland now.  However, then the thermometer plummeted Friday afternoon, and by the time I was on my way home, I needed not duck feet, but was walking like a penguin on newly frozen, uneven ground, which doubled as the sidewalk.    Slipping and sliding my way along, nursing a cold all week, I was looking forward to just getting home to where it was warm.  As I approached my building on the barely lit street, I saw it was cordoned off like it was under siege or a bomb threat?  Nope, just to keep falling icicles from impaling passerbies, forcing them to share the road with the cars, which were also inching along, hemmed in on both sides by frozen snow banks.  I can only feel sorry for the elderly that have to negotiate their way on these dark, slippery and icy streets, and wonder in awe at the girls that can manage it in stilettos.    Finally, I made it around the roped off area and to my own entryway.  The front door had been broken for weeks now, and propped open with a piece of ragged carpet.  Not the most high tech way to secure the building, but then again, I have another two doors between my apartment and the street, so did not think too much about it.  When I reached the door, I realized that they had decided to fix the door by welding a piece of metal over where the keyhole used to be, forcing everyone to use the alternative key pad.  Of course, no one had informed anyone, and therefore no one could have known that this was how the landlords would fix the problem.  I searched frantically through my wallet, looking for that scrap of paper - the back of a store receipt - on which I had scribbled the key code number over four months earlier, and which I hoped I had not since lost.  I was dreading a Friday night, with no one to call, and standing outside my apartment building with no way to get in.  Thankfully, I was able to find my key code and it worked.  As it turned out I did not have to worry.  It seems my apartment building is about as secure as a siv.    The weekend came and went, as it does, as did Monday night ice hockey.  Since I sharpened my skates, I found I could actually stop quickly and turn sharp corners without falling on my butt, which is definitely a plus when you are playing hockey.  Tuesday, I finally got paid, in cash, my outstanding business travel expenses from last year.  I may work in a bank, but it does not mean they part with their money quickly or willingly.  In any case, so went the week.  Wet and gray mornings, icy winds in the evenings, and getting home after dark.  Yesterday promised to be no different.  I had Russian lessons at 8 p.m., and left the office a little earlier so I could be home on time.  I need not have bothered because by the time I got home, my teacher had sent a text message saying she did not feel up to braving the elements and begged off our planned lessons.  No problems, but what to do with a free evening?     As I mentioned, the outside door to the building is controlled by a key code.  Then there is another door, from the staircase landing, which seals off two adjoining apartments, the neighbor’s and mine.  Then there are two doors, one-steel with two locks, and one flimsy wooden door into my apartment.  The minute I turned the key in the outer door lock, I knew there was something wrong, as the key would not go in properly and needed some jiggling to get it to work.  Inside the first door, I saw somewhat to my surprise that the doorknob on the metal security door was hanging loosely, and had been pried-off with some sort of crowbar.  I tried the deadbolt lock above, and to my displeasure saw that the deadbolt had already been sprung, and therefore someone had been in my apartment.  However, now that the metal door was closed again, it was effectively locked from the inside, and the key obviously would not turn the lock, as it had been pried almost completely off.    What to do?  I dialed my boss in the office on my mobile and tried to explain what a wrecking bar is, and how someone could use it to debilitate my door.  He promised to contact the office manager, a kind of all round fixit man, who in turn would call the building superintendent, Sergei.  He also promised to come around to see what was wrong himself.  Sergei is the one that has been promising on and off since before Christmas to someday fix my leaking radiator in my living room, that has been the source of two of my three apartment floods.  He just laughs when I mention the oven does not work.  Of course, it doesn’t he explains, it used to be a gas oven, and when they renovated it was replaced with an electric one.  There was, unfortunately, no power source to the stove, but it is new and looks good in the kitchen.     Somewhat to my pleasant surprise, Sergei comes running up the steps to my apartment less than thirty minutes later.  He is most concerned, and as he does not speak English and I am hopeless at Russian, we sometimes talk a few words of German together, and manage to make ourselves understood.  I point to the lock, make the motion of someone using a wrecking bar as leverage on the lock, and then point to the innards of the lock and indicate I need a screwdriver.  I think about 10-percent of what I say is understood, which isn’t bad when you have the visual clue of a broken door lock, and he grasps the nettle of the situation.  He disappears to get some ‘instruments’, which I take to mean ‘tools’, and I wait a few minutes until he returns with a hacksaw and a pair of pliers, not the screwdriver I had requested.  In for a penny, in for a pound, he decides the best course of action is to completely remove the doorknob with the hacksaw.  I am a bit leery, fiddling with a crime scene before the police arrive, but it has not occurred to Sergei, yet, to call them, and I am curious to see what’s gone on inside my apartment?  I hope for the best, steel myself for the worst.       Meanwhile, the cavalry arrives in the form of my boss, Andrey, Anatoliy Ivanovich, the other fixit man in our company and an ex-KGB officer, which is always handy when having to deal with the police, as well as, Alexei.  Alexei is the head of our IT department, but the three are sometimes inseparable, and under the circumstances I was happy for all the help I could get.    After the pleasantries are over, Sergei, Andrey, Anatoliy and Alexei survey the situation.  I again do my miming of a crowbar on the lock, and indicate that, as I found it, the top lock was already open.  Not how I left it this morning, I assure them.  Hmm?  All hands reach for their cell phones and we decide to call either 911, the police or the militia depending on which busy line we get through on first.  And, the winner was the militia.  Sergei quickly explains the situation and our whereabouts.  I have never successfully been able to explain to anyone that although my address is on Ulitsa Burdenko, that my entrance is around the corner on Novokonoushenny Pereluk, but that there is no number on the door, and the number on the building around the corner is not the actual address.  I am at number 12, but the number on the building is 16.  However, there is a large tooth attached to the corner of the building, as there is a dentist in the basement, and this is a handy reference point.  However, Sergei is able to convey this message to the militia without having to resort to pointing out famous local landmarks, such as the tank mounted on the top of the military academy kitty corner from my building.     We stand back, there is no place to sit except on the dirty stairs, and wait for the militia to arrive.  Our best guess is sometime in the next hour or two?  Within in 20-minutes they are also coming up the stairs, but not first without calling Sergei to ask where the entrance is?  I am vindicated.  The three-militia officers climb the stairs and join our small, but growing, group outside the door in the hallway.  The usual explanations are given.  No one quite knows what to do, so maybe we should stop for a smoke and think about it?  The cigarettes and lighters come out, and everyone but me gets their nicotine fix.  Cooler heads prevail, and Anatoliy Ivanovich digs through his pockets and comes out with a longer key than I had to use as a screwdriver.  He is then able to spring the lock as I predicted.  I have changed enough doorknobs and locks in my previous lives before I was an investment banker to know at least that.  However, now the door is open, and no one knows if anyone is inside?  We all step well back and out of the way, as the Kalashnikov rifle comes off one officer’s shoulder and the other draws his pistol.  It’s all business now.  Two officers go in and make sure there are no further surprises, while the third accidentally lets the metal door close again, locking it from inside.  No need to panic, there is nothing going on anymore inside, and one of the officers is able to reopen the door from the other side.      Skip a few minutes and I am finally given the go ahead to enter and have a look around.  I have been mentally thinking what I had of value to lose and where I had stashed them.  My hopes were quickly dashed.  Everything was upside down and nothing was spared.  It was honestly just like in the movies when the thieves give your apartment a good going over.  Everything was out of the cupboards and thrown on the floor, and it looks worse than it actually is.    I headed for where I kept my money, thinking it had been quite well put away safely, at least from honest thieves, but found out immediately my hopes had been misplaced.  Empty jacket pockets confirmed my worst fears, $2000 in long awaited expense money was gone.  That’s equivalent to ten dinners for two at Café Pushkin or a ski week at St. Moritz.  Money better spent for sure.  I then turned my attention to the new notebook computer the firm had given me, under the bench in the kitchen.  Also, gone, contents from my laptop case emptied on the kitchen table.  They were only taking the good stuff and planned to travel light.  The buggers even grabbed my Swiss Army knife.  It was the perfect size, with just the right functionality, and I will miss it.  My Omega watch, which never quite worked well, my credit card, my bankcard, my driver’s license, everything of value, gone.  All kept in various locations throughout my apartment, but not one nook was overlooked.  They searched in places I would never think to hide things.  Under the baseboards of the kitchen cupboards; behind the toilet where the hot-water mains are; up in the filter above the stove (clean, as I cannot use it); and in every empty carton throughout the apartment, testament to my transitory nature.  They even took a bottle of Crown Royal and left me with the Canadian Club.  The police confirmed this often happens.  I guess they take a bottle of whatever they can find to toast their good fortune, in this case, my best whiskey.         I do not have much stuff, but collectively on the floor it looks quite impressive.  Ironically, I do not usually have that much cash.  It is an idiosyncrasy of not having a ruble bank account for expenses.  They missed my digital camera.  It was in my old, blue knapsack, which I take everywhere.  It was thrown in the same cupboard as my dirty laundry.  They had rifled through the unwashed clothes and sheets, but did not bother to check the rucksack.  Good for me, at least that is one thing they overlooked.  Thinking about urban legends, I turned the camera on to see if the thieves could not resist taking a picture of themselves with my toothbrush up their butts, but not even that.  I guess in their leisurely pace of haste they had simply overlooked it?  I am glad because I still have lots of photos on that camera, and the ones I had uploaded were on the laptop, which now has a new home.          I was told not to touch anything.  The ‘serious crime unit’ of the Moscow police showed up shortly afterwards and sheparded me out of the apartment.  First photos, then the sniffer-dog with its handler, and finally the finger print expert.  In all, another four police officers arrived, and as it was starting to get crowded, the militia bade their farewells.  I cannot complain about the speed or effectiveness of the police.  Far from being inefficient, lazy and inept, they were thorough and professional.  Not the impression you get when you see the grunts on the street stopping traffic and harassing drivers.  Or what you read in the papers.  They took three separate statements from me, which was interesting given the gap in language skills.  I assume so that they can then cross reference them, but perhaps to ensure they are accurate and the officers do not miss anything important.  The K-9 handler came in and went out to see if the dog could catch any scent of the intruders in the neighborhood or perhaps confirm that the crime was not committed by someone in-house.  The finger printer dusted everything down.  I am dubious about the value of this, but perhaps they can find a match, if not now, then in the future.    I am not confident it will help me get my stuff back, but at least they tried.  I was more interested in it due to insurance.  I was hoping I would be able to claim something back under my household insurance, and I would need identity theft protection if they used my credit cards and ID for fraud.  The police stayed in the apartment until almost midnight.  The Three Musketeers, or the Triad as I call them, got a little bored after the police came, so they wandered off for dinner, but promised to come back.  Around eleven they did, and Andrey was able to translate everything for me before I signed any of the three testaments.  Surprisingly, given the language problems - we used Russian, English, German, a dictionary and much gesticulation to communicate at times - that the statements were extremely accurate.    The hardest part of the evening was calling my wife, in Germany, and telling her about the break-in and asking her to cancel all my credit cards and report my driver’s license as stolen.  Of course, this news just made her worried.  Then I had to clean up the apartment, or at least the kitchen and bedroom, so I could go to sleep.  I slept surprisingly well after Sergei and I had a few shots of vodka to settle our nerves after everyone else had left.  Then he bid me adieu and promised to replace the locks in the morning.  Mindful that he had promised to fix my radiator before New Year’s we shall see?    Tomorrow I will call the police and make an appointment to see them next week.  Monday, with my translator in tow, I will give yet some more statements to the police, and clarify any questions they might have.  I also have to get finger printed.  Oh well, it is not the first time, so I guess Interpol can find me if I decide to abscond with the company’s pension plan.    I do not know, it can happen anywhere at anytime?  This is not unique to Moscow.  However, it is a bit disturbing to know that I was probably targeted.  Followed home from a nightclub or restaurant, so they knew where I lived.  Maybe they made a copy of the key for my main lock from the keys in my pocket when I checked my coat in one of the mandatory cloakrooms around town.  They might have watched my movements to know when I was and was not home.  They certainly planned well and were professional.  Of course, none of my neighbors saw or heard anything, although it was most likely perpetrated in the middle of the day.  However, this is the best time of day for thieves, when occupants are most likely to be out working.    As a foreigner here, you do stick out, and as soon as someone engages you in a conversation they know you are not Russian.  From then on you are a target, and my friends here tell me I am far too open and too friendly to complete strangers.  Oh well, I guess this is because, this episode aside, I have had very few problems, and mostly the people I have met have befriended me and helped me in new and strange places, in languages I had not yet learnt to speak.  However, I guess I will have to be more careful in the future.  At the end of the day, it is only money and a few things that can be replaced.  I did not lose anything that was dear to me.  I just have to notch it up to experience and hope my string of floods and bad luck in my apartment in Moscow will take it a little easier on me from now on.  On the other hand this is all just speculation, and it might have been a random break-in based on the probability that in a good apartment, in a good area, that there is something worth stealing inside.  It was great to be able to call friends and have them drop everything and come help me.  And, thanks to everyone who called and was concerned about my well being.        Bill.      Moscow, February 5th, 2004   urlLink Epilogue     So, it is Friday morning.  No, Sergei did not manage to fix my locks, so I spent my second night in the apartment with the same locks on the doors that had already proved themselves worthless.  Yes, I had to spring the lock outside again with my house-key, and made a note to myself to carry a Leatherman in my briefcase.  However, the big news makes my problems miniscule.  This morning, while I was on the way to work, a terrorist bomb went off in the Metro station near my office (not my stop, but not far by foot), killing at least 39-people.  I am off to Germany this weekend, for my wife’s birthday party, and was already looking forward to more adventures with infuriating traffic jams; customs problems; slow check-in; poor, indifferent service from Aeroflot; and rogue taxi drivers.  Now, I see these minor irritations as background noise when more than 39-innocent people lose their lives in a pointless act of political violence.

       urlLink Just a matter of Faith    It was his job to put the coffee on in the mornings. As he sat in bed, propped up by pillows, drinking his first cup, he could look out over the Keuzeck Alm and see the Oesterfelder plateau. The Zugspitz was hidden behind the peak of Alpspitz. At least he could not see it from his bed. The narrowness of the doorway prevented him viewing more of the panorama other than what was directly in front of him. However, if he opened the patio door, he could catch a glimpse of the mountains in the southeast. With the door positioned just right, the reflection in the glass made it appear like the mountain range continued further to the west. Of course it did, but not same ridge as he saw in his make-do mirror. Still, this illusion provided him a wider view, as he sat in bed drinking coffee, and he liked it.   The birds were singing their praises quite loudly for this time of morning. He was already feeling guilty about lying around for even a moment on such a beautiful day. However, his wife was still sleeping next to him, and he knew how unpopular he would be if he jumped up to go hiking, leaving her to do the grocery shopping. They usually went hiking together after the weekly chores were done. Even though this often meant wasting the best part of the day. The mountains were like that. They often brought their own change of weather when least expected. How often had their plans changed after starting out so promising?   So, he made his compromise, and sat in bed looking out the window at the view he loved so much. Drinking his coffee and thinking. After four summers, he could still look at this view everyday.   He tried to avoid looking at them. He always tried not to see them, and to look beyond at the mountains, but it was impossible. Once you know they are there, you cannot help but see them. And, once you see them, you cannot help but stare at them.   Eventually, his gaze was drawn to the two faces in the cliff, and then automatically his eyes were pulled down and to the right, to the third, smaller face. Together the three faces stared back at him, as they had done every morning.   At first, he had seen only the one face, and then later another. He had not seen the other face immediately at all. He had assumed it was only the shadows on the rocks and vegetation and, like cloud watching, that the images would disappear in a short while. However, the two faces, and then the third, were always there looking down on him.   He thought this was interesting, but that is was temporary. Surely they would disappear as soon as the seasons changed? True enough, when winter arrived, they partially vanished from view, and he thought less about them. When spring returned, and the world was reborn, they were there again. Now, after four years, he believed they were here to stay.   Impressed, he shared his observations with others. They too could make out the familiar faces, if only after a bit of coaching. Wanting evidence that they existed he took photographs of the images, and was not surprised when they appeared plain for all to see.   He wondered why they were not more famous? He wondered why they were not known at all? New Hampshire had their Old Man of the Mountains, their State landmark, and thousands had flocked to see it. Until it fell off, like the Sphinx’s nose, one day.   He was sure these faces had been here a long time, and yet no one else had seen them? He had wondered if they could only be seen from his balcony, but when he had looked for them from other places in the valley, he could see them when he looked for them.   In Fernie, they had an Indian motif that appeared in the twilight shadows, and then was gone. They had built a legend around those shadows, and people came to see them. Why not here? Perhaps legends are easier to understand and demand less from us?   It did not take much imagination to see who those faces were that stared back at him each day.   In the upper, right hand corner, near the top of the cliff, was a young woman. Her head was tilted slightly upwards. Her face slightly turned to him. Her eyes were shut, as if in prayer. She had a clean, straight nose, and a gentle, benign smile. The sun played on the meadow above her head to give the impression of a garland. The slope continued on around her cheek and down past her neck to finish the illusion of hair. He had seen her in the rock first. Only after he had seen her, studied her, and marveled at her likeness, did his eye pick out the second, half-hidden figure behind her upturned, smiling face.   On the crown of the slope where her garland ended was a noticeable dip, and then the start of his profile. The left half of his face was obscured forever from view by hers. His face was more oblong than her face, and clearly masculine, almost Roman. He had thought at first that it was a sinister looking face, and early on he had imagined sad legends involving a young Germanic maiden and a Roman soldier to explain how the angry gods had cast their busts in stone.   The right hand side was quite well defined, and he could make out his eye, the nostrils at the end of a long nose, a slight frown, and a jutting chin. The cheekbones were high, and a large ear peaked out from under his hair and the start of his own headpiece. It was perhaps the long face, and high cheekbones, plus the dark, brooding eye that had lead him to conclude it was a sinister face? Perhaps it was only the disapproving look from this man in stone that gave that impression? Sometimes it made him feel uncomfortable to be judged by such an unyielding figure.   For a long time he had watched these two faces and wondered who they were, and how they came to be frozen in the rock? It was only after he came to see the third face that he realized who they were. He did not come to see the baby’s face on his own. It was farther down on the right hand side. As if in the crook of the arm of the man in stone. He had first missed it until his stepfather had pointed it out.   His mother had remarried a number of years after his father had passed away. Paul and his mother had come to visit during their second summer in Garmisch. Paul was a religious man. He had pointed out his find, and then they had argued at length about Pius XII’s complicity in the Second World War.   He was being a devil’s advocate, but the merits of the book were obvious, and he had read enough of the Church’s excesses to question that the Pope was God’s representative here on Earth. Although not agnostic, he seldom went to church. His own beliefs were strong, but not always consistent. And, he had sinned enough that he kept his true views to himself, not wanting to be accused of being a hypocrite.   The truth of the matter was when he was hiking in the mountains, sweating, taking in the valley far below him, and seeing the peaks reaching up to caress the sky, was when he was in His Domain. No church on Earth could inspire him like Nature. He was happiest, when he was up in the mountains reveling in all they had to offer. If he sinned, it was only the pleasure that he would feel taking his lunch in the sunshine, or in linking perfect turns on skis in the fresh powder. Regardless of his other sins on Earth, he was sure the Redeemer would not frown on his use of the Lord’s Day to enjoy the splendor He Himself had created.   So he enjoyed challenging somewhat the views of the believers in organized religion. Were not far more than the sins of the flesh, the sins of pride, and especially of religious pride, the more serious of the sins? Although Paul was a wonderful fellow, he poked at his arguments, and gave him Hitler’s Pope to read and to reflect on. And, if by answer, Paul had found the missing figure for him.   Given it was a small apartment they had given up their bedroom to Paul and his mom. They had slept on the inflatable mattress on the floor in the living room. Although the apartment was not large, it was warm, cozy and inviting to friends and family. They had enjoyed having their family visit, even though it meant giving up their bed. For many months now, perhaps from the beginning, they had had their problems. It was nice having others around during these tough periods as a relief from the guilt and pressures that come from a shaky marriage.   Paul had been reading his new book and contemplating its message. How could God’s representative on Earth allow such horrible things to happen, and to remain painfully silent? Although not a one-sided debate, the evidence at hand was quite clear in its condemnation. The Pope had been more of a politician, lawyer, and diplomat, than a moral voice in the wilderness of a man-made world gone horribly wrong.   As Paul sat on the bed and reflected on these things, the boy became visible to him. The image that had escaped them all up to now had made itself apparent to Paul almost immediately. Perhaps it was his faith and looking for answers to unsolvable questions?   Outside his apartment the noise of a lawnmower broke the Saturday morning’s silence rather rudely interrupting the singing of the birds. Somewhere a dog barked. She was up and around, busy getting ready to go shopping, and he knew it was time to rouse himself from his thoughts.   He drank in one last look at the majestic view just beyond his reach, took a last sip of coffee, and decided to roll out of bed for good. If he was going to climb any mountains today, he couldn’t do it by sitting in bed just thinking about it. Even though it was not Sunday, yet, it was a good day to spend worshipping in God’s Cathedral.&nbsp; He knew he would not walk alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   May 24th, 2003 – Garmisch

       What's in a name? Well, I just did a  urlLink http://www.google.com/  search on my first and last name. After 50 google pages of about 500 webpages, I turned up just a few pages that had anything to do with my family or myself. All the rest were about notorious serial killers, Jeffrey & Clifford Dahmer, and a civil right's activist, Vernon Dahmer, killed by the KKK in 1966.  Nothing about  urlLink John Dahmer ,  urlLink Member Elect  for Canada's House of Commons.

        urlLink Is The New York Times a Liberal Newspaper?    So, in my very first Blog,  urlLink getting started is never easy , on July 7th, I mentioned the fact that The New York Times tended to pass their own journalistic point of view on a range of&nbsp;subjects&nbsp;off as unbiased&nbsp;fact.&nbsp;   "Also, there is a lot of garbage written and passed off as journalism. You soon get a feeling for the right- or left-lean of an editorial. I prefer well balanced views, and not personal opinion masquerading as unbiased fact. Now you're probably wondering why do I read the New York Times then, which is almost always biased by their social agenda? Well, it is always useful to read other points of view, and on occasion, they can write some interesting stories."   And, then on July 8th, in  urlLink The Chinese Century , I acknowledged just such an article, which was well written and carried an interesting message.&nbsp;   However, even I was surprised to read the editorial today by Daniel Okrent, The Public Editor of the NY Times, who poses this very question, and then unabashedly answers, yes, but by benign neglect not&nbsp;design.&nbsp; His point, which I accept, is that NY is a fairly liberal place, and that the NY Times reflects that.&nbsp; In fact, the reason why so many people are drawn to live and work in NYC, including their own writers, is that it is a fairly creative place, and that is part of its appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;   His criticism, which I share, is that by not providing the three-dimensional perspective, which balanced&nbsp;journalism requires, the&nbsp;writers and&nbsp;editors of the paper can end&nbsp;up cheerleading a particular social cause du jour without providing their readers with any balanced reporting.&nbsp; This inbred approach&nbsp;of narrowing their and their readers' views, so that they can only come to one conclusion, say left versus right, liberal over conservative ideals, excludes the possibility that the otherside may have a point afterall.&nbsp;   It is not so much what the journalists write per se, but what they do not write about that cheats their readers out of balance coverage&nbsp;on any particular issue.&nbsp; This encourages the reader to become polarised in every&nbsp;debate without having given it much thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure this is not the leftwing conspiracy of the neo liberal elite, but just a case of preaching to the converted without a&nbsp;healthy dose of cohabitation of outside views which may be uncomfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would be interested to know how many NY Times subscribers also read the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times and or&nbsp;The Economist?   I recently spent the weekend in Beirut, Lebanon.&nbsp; A country not so long ago&nbsp;divided by an ugly civil war.&nbsp; Now being rebuilt, the downtown is one of the most pleasant places I have been lucky enough to visit this summer.&nbsp; Although the pockmarks of bullets in the walls of the surrounding buildings can still be easily seen from the main square.&nbsp;&nbsp; What made the city so interesting were the many readily identifiable groups cohabiting the square on&nbsp;a&nbsp;Saturday night.&nbsp; Each simply enjoying a pleasant evening, their children playing in the streets minded by their mothers or foreign&nbsp;nannies, as the Mosque called the men to evening prayers.&nbsp; While the non-devout enjoyed wine, beer or the smoke of a bubble pipe in the sidewalk cafés.&nbsp;&nbsp; Young girls in short skirts, walking, talking and giggling, while at the same time conservative women wore their traditional veil and garb.&nbsp; No one took exception with anyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Beirut, an ancient city with Roman ruins, Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches and Mosques all within a stone's throw of one another, and armed soliders on every corner just in case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I do not pretend to understand Middle Eastern politics, what caused the hosilities, ongoing problems in the region, and what is driving the rebirth of the city now, while the rest of the area seems to be consumed by confict.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, it seems that all sides are making an effort to understand one another and to stop demonising the other.&nbsp;

       Unfortunately,  urlLink Caroline Baum , and  urlLink Richard Cookson , don't agree on one thing, Do higher oil prices act like a tax? For me it is a very interesting question because they both write very intelligently about the world economy and markets, and both appear to know what they are talking about?   Caroline Baum is a journalist for Bloomberg, and Richard Cookson, a.k.a. Buttonwood, writes and edits for the Economist. I follow their stories with great interest. So why the disagreement?   Here is Caroline Baum's point of view, which stoked a small tirade of reaction, but probably for the wrong reasons.    It's axiomatic that  urlLink higher gas prices  act like a tax  on consumers.  It's also dead wrong. There is nothing about a demand-driven  rise in oil prices that will discourage oil production and reduce  the quantity supplied to the market, which is precisely the  effect of a tax.  Tax something more, and you get less of it: Now there's an  axiom you can hang your hat on. If the government imposes a tax  on a good or service, the effect will be to shift the demand  curve back (inward) or the supply curve upward, depending on  whether the tax is levied on the consumer or producer. In both  cases, the quantity supplied at the new equilibrium is lower than  it was before.  Bloomberg, May 24, 2004   And, here is what Richard Cookson, had to say,    A nice argument, except that a demand shock from China looks very much like a supply shock to anyone else, and worries about the Middle East are arguably just as important. Moreover, the situation looks very different in America, where the effects of rising crude prices flow through to the forecourt much more quickly than in Britain because the dollar has been weak and because taxes account for a smaller proportion of the pump price (23%, versus 75% in Britain). A short-lived third oil shock, in 1990 (just ahead of the first Gulf war) was enough to help tip America into recession. America’s gasoline prices have risen 40% or so since December. The effect of this rise is  urlLink much like a tax , and it will eat into consumers’ wallets at the same time as the government’s huge fiscal stimulus is wearing off. Unless they can put up prices, companies, too, will have to accept lower profits.  The Economist, June 1st, 2004   So are higher oil prices a tax or not? Caroline Baum is correct that higher oil prices are caused by increased demand, and that these petrol-dollars are reinvested in $US-denominated stocks and bonds, and therefore, they are recycled and do not leave the financial system. However, the reinvestment rate will always be less than 100-percent. Richard Cookson is correct in that prices and wages are sticky, so that even if higher growth causes higher demand, not everyone will benefit, at least not in the short term and certainly there will always be winners and losers in a competitive market. And, for those that cannot increase their earnings to compensate for higher oil prices, they will have to cut back someplace else, just like a tax puts a break on consumption.   If the government raises taxes, but redistributes tax dollars domestically, especially to low- and middle-income families, most of those redirected taxes will be recycled back into the economy, i.e. a high multiplier effect. However, if oil money flows from the consumers to the producers of this petrol, the money leaves the system, at least temporarily, unless it is immediately reinvested in $US stocks and bonds. However, if Saudi or other OPEC governments choose to redistribute oil wealth to their own people, to put it into London real-estate, or choose not to fund the US-budget deficit, then these dollars leave the US domestic economy. The Sheiks are not driving around in Ford's and Chevy's, so the multiplier effect is much lower, or could be seen as a net drain from the local economy. In this case, the higher oil prices act somewhat like a wealth transfer tax, but instead of from high income earners to low income earners, from consumers to producers. When oil is $40 per barrel, which would you prefer to be?   What you don't want to be is your average European, say a German. The economy and your income have stagnated; you're being asked to work a 40 hour week instead of a 35 hour week, for no extra money; your house has not risen in value with lower interest rates, as elsewhere; and your job may soon migrate to eastern Europe, so consumer confidence is plumbing the lows. The demand that is driving oil prices higher at the pumps is coming from the USA and China, not local industry; and due to green- or eco-taxes on petrol, the government's take adds 67-percent to the price of benzine.   Exactly how expensive is gasoline in Europe or Germany in particular? At EUR 1.15 per liter, and a EUR USD exchange rate of 1.23, Germans' pay $5.35 per US gallon or $224.86 per barrel. If Brent is trading at a discount to WTI, say $38 per barrel versus $40, then the government's share in taxes is $168.65, and the remainder $18.21 is for transport, refining, distribution, general sales and administration costs. Two things become obvious, don't blame the oil companies for the high cost of petrol, as it is the government that takes an overwhelming share, assuming a consumption tax is more efficient and fair than increasing general income taxes, which are higher in Europe than in the USA for example. And secondly, between stagnating incomes, higher taxes and higher benzine prices, the effect is working exactly like a tax, it is curbing end demand, but not stimulating extra supply. But, as gasoline demand is inelastic in the short-term, consumers are forced to make cut-backs elsewhere, slowing down economic growth. Stagflation anyone?   Bill.

       Buttonwood urlLink     Dear  urlLink Buttonwood ,   The one thing that I cannot get my head around is who will benefit from the US' malaise, if and when the dollar falls on a trade weighted basis? Falls against which currencies exactly? China's Renminbi is pegged against the dollar at approximately 8.2765. Should the Yuan strengthen dramatically against the dollar, this should slow exports to the Great Spender, Importer & Consumer of Last Resort, and hit Chinese growth and therefore stability prospects. Slower growth in China would derail Japan's own nascent recovery, and put a serious dent in other SE Asian interregional trade balances. Despite strong trade flows to China, and directly or indirectly to the US, the last thing Asian governments want or need is a weaker dollar making their own currencies too strong, hence their decision to purchase US dollar assets in the form of US treasury bonds. As you have pointed out, Asian central banks may already be worried about their high exposure to a lower US dollar and holding bonds, which will depreciate when interest rates do move higher, and the negative cost of carry to hold these assets.   Weaker growth in China and SE Asia would also put a dent, perhaps much needed, in mine, mineral and energy prices hurting such emerging market economies as Russia and S. Africa, who are dependant on these commodities to pay for their own much needed structural reforms and the high cost of battling such scourges as HIV &amp; AIDS, which are necessary to avoid social discontent at home. S. Africa aside, the rest of Africa is dependent on debt forgiveness, foreign aid, and the goodwill of their neighbors, and there is unlikely to be an African renaissance anytime soon. Higher global interest rates and perhaps lower commodity prices will certainly not help the emerging market universe. Where Argentina has led, Brazil and Turkey may follow, and if there is turmoil in Russia, Brazil and Turkey, it is hard to imagine that other developing countries will attract foreign capital easily or on good terms. With the exception of Chile, the outlook in Latin America is more likely to muddle through versus being a poster child for economic reform. I do not forecast peace and prosperity breaking out in the Middle East anytime soon, and any windfall from higher oil prices now, will be spent mopping up social instability at home, invested abroad and or tucked away in Switzerland. Might EU countries benefit from a weaker US dollar and higher interest rates in the US? Not likely, with aging populations, deep structural problems, and a lack of political will to tackle them, it is hard to see how a stronger Euro will deliver higher growth and confidence to Europe, who are already moving their jobs eastward? That leaves a clutch of other countries such as Australia, Canada, Switzerland, the UK, and perhaps a few others which may benefit from an outflow in investment from the US, but still not be hurt too much from higher global interest rates and lower commodity prices. However, there are likely property bubbles in both Australia and the UK, and Canada and Australia are the drawers of water and hewers of wood for the rest of the world. Therefore, they are also not immune from higher interest rates and lower global growth.   This reminds me of the really bad movie in the 70's called Rollover starring Kris Kristofferson and Jane Fonda. The whole premise was that the Arabs would stop funding America's huge budget deficit plunging the currency markets into turmoil. When the crisis comes our protagonist instructs his traders to sell everything. Sell dollars, sell Sterling, sell yen, sell francs, sell Deutschmarks, sell everything. It made for great cinema drama, but the question was, if they were selling every currency, what were they buying? I assume they were not taking delivery in Martian pesos?   There are no simple answers, only dumb questions it seems, but I really do not see who will benefit from a dramatically lower dollar? It is clear that the US cannot fund its deficits, debts, and unfunded pension and healthcare liabilities, as far as the eye can see. But, it is also unclear how this bad trade will unwind itself and to who's benefit? Rollover II, The Debt Hangover of The Day After Tomorrow, starring Dennis Quaid, Tom Cruise, and Jennifer Aniston? The day the Americans stopped buying from the Asians and importing oil from the Arabs, who in turn stopped funding America, and how the rest of the world watched in horror (France with schadenfreude), but didn't know what to do? Directed by Micheal Moore. Music by K.D. Lang and The Dixie Chicks. "Beef stinks, but so does George W." There may be a small part for Ben Stiller, as it is hard to imagine a summer flick without him in it someplace?   Sincerely,   WJMD.

       urlLink    This article is one reason why I still read NYTimes.com.  It is an excellent article.  Sure it is probably a little exaggerated, and it extrapolates linear trends far into the future - trees do not grow to Heaven - but it manages to give a voice to those nagging fears one gets, but cannot manage to put into a coherent argument with facts and figures.    China had always been a big country, with a large population, and, of course, it has long been a regional security threat, but so long as it was The Long March, The Cultural Revolution, The Great Leap Forward, or other ideological experiments, one could rest assured that democratic values and capitalism would prevail as the superior economic model, and that the West would always be rich, and that China would stay backward and poor.  However, when over a billion people enthusiastically embrace capitalism, our model, our methods, and then turn it upside down, then one is not so sure anymore.    As this article manages well to point out, it is not just what China can produce, but the China Price.  Whatever we can produce, if they get their hands on it, they can produce it cheaper, due to an abundant supply of cheap, skilled labor.  Of course, I have a few issues with this line of argument, but the article is none the less excellent and well worth reading, if only for background and a few quite astonishing facts.           Bill.

       urlLink     About a year ago, when I was getting ready to leave Munich and move first to Moscow and then eventually Limassol, Cyprus, I started doing Googles on the cities to get more information about them. My searches turned up  urlLink http://www.virtualtourist.com/m/5c0cc/ , which has been an enormous help whenever I have needed travel related information. I liked it enough that I set-up my own travel pages (see link) and started posting photos and commentary on the various places that I have lived, worked or studied.   Now like any online community, VT has its own quirks and kooks. But, this is not to detract from its core of users which selflessly upload photos of places they have visited, write reviews for other travelers, answer questions, and generally make themselves available for others looking for travel advice on places they would like to visit. Of course, there are some members that always seem to be online, and perhaps don't have as much a real life as they should, along with those who think they know it all, which really annoys us that do. However, let's be magnanimous and say that everyone is just trying to be helpful where they can.   I can highly recommend this webpage for people looking for information or just wanting a little fantasy travel during the day. If you are looking for specific information about a place, you can join a Forum and post a question. Hopefully, one or more VTers will then respond to your question with a useful answer. However, before asking a question, you should have done some of your own basic homework, such as visiting the webpages of hotel &amp; airline booking sites yourself to check flights and availability, as well as prices, and done some research about the place you would like to visit by stopping by some of the Member's pages that have taken the time and effort to upload pictures and comments about 'what to see and do when in Rome' before you go into a Forum and ask, What's the best way to get to Rome from London? How much will it cost? What should I see while I am in Rome? It can get a trifle tiring to answer these same questions again and again, when a simple Google, and a visit to some VT pages on Rome, would have sufficed to answer these basic questions.   One of my favorite questions is 'I am going to be in Europe for the first time this summer for 10-days. What should I see? How much will it cost? Which currency should I bring?' Well, there are several obvious problems with this question. I do not know you or what your interests are? Are you active or more culturally inclined? Do you like crowded cities or wide open spaces in the Alps? I have been in Europe for 12-years and haven't seen it all, so therefore should I reccommend you see one city or one area well, or try to hit multiple cities? What is your budget? Are you traveling business class or hitch hiking and staying in hostels? What currency should I bring? Well, euros if your in one of the 12 countries that accepts them, and which ever other local currency if you're not. So take your choice of 13 different currencies just for the members of the EU, plus those other countries in Europe that are not members of the EU, like Switzerland and Norway, just to name two. So you get my drift, do some basic research before you ask a brazenly bizarre question. I am not saying people will be rude to you, but we'll laugh at you behind your back! haha   Also, one of my pet peeves are people that ask for advice and then never say thank you to those that take time to respond to their queries. Be polite. If someone helps you out, say thank you, visit their travel pages, leave a comment and rate some of their tips. It is just common courtesy, and will be much appreciated.   Like any online community, personalities become known. They're are some that use it like a dating service. Some that flame others or try to prove that they always know better. Some that just seem not to have anything else to do, so they hang around in the Miscellaneous Forum and just send one-liners and inside jokes back and forth that no outsider can be party to. The question being, why not then just send an email? Different keyboard strokes for different online folks, I guess?   The burnout rate for some dedicated users is quite high. You go through a lot of effort to contribute pictures, commentary, answer questions and make tips, and then you wonder for what? However, I found it was a good way for me to relive certain times and places in my life, and like a blog, to document it. I wish I would have started building such pages when I first moved to Europe 12-years ago. My most recent pages are my best, and they get weaker the farther back I go. Especially, because I have so many pictures, but they are not in digital format, and I haven't had them all scanned into the computer. Had I started years ago, I would have more or less a permanent record now of my travels, complete with actual names of street and bars, which are now just in the fog of my imagination. I can hardly remember the names of cities, much less the name of that wine I had in that great restaurant down near the Charles Bridge on that summer evening. Hence, like a blog, to document it all for posterity or until some virus wipes out the central servers.   So, that is my plug for VirtualTourist.com, and I welcome you to stop by my pages. As I explain, they are a work in progress, and I will try to keep them updated and enhanced. Take care and enjoy your own travel planning and vacation this summer.   Bill.

       Getting started is never easy, unless you know exactly where you want to end up and how to get there. However, the whole point about wandering around with no particular destination in mind is about the journey.  Everyday I read a ton of material online from Bloomberg, Reuters, the New York Times, the Financial Times, and many other sources, such as The McKinsey Quarterly, Harvard Business Review, and, of course, The Economist. I would read more, but I am limited by how much I can read in a day, and still work, and also by how much eye strain I can stand. However, all this reading tends to make me think as well. One conclusion is that there are a lot of smart people writing about many different fields and it is a full-time job just to keep abreast of a hand-full of topics, much less all there is to learn. Duh.  Also, there is a lot of garbage written and passed off as journalism. You soon get a feeling for the right- or left-lean of an editorial. I prefer well balanced views and not  urlLink personal opinion  masquerading as unbiased fact. Now your probably wondering why do I read the New York Times then, which is almost always biased by their social agenda? Well, it is always useful to read other points of view, and on occasion, they can write some interesting stories. However, given how much I need to read, I really do not have anytime for 'news lite'- something that takes time to read, but doesn't give me any new or interesting information. A lot of daily newspapers fall under this category, which is why I rarely read them. Pick-up a copy of any Daily Telegraph, the Sun, the Daily Mail (just because I have access to UK papers here in Cyprus), and they have absolutely no news in them. Just photos, gossip, sport, poorly written editorials, and other garbage. What is really scary is that these are the only sources of news that the average person reads, if they read, to help them form their views on politics and economics. No wonder politicians pander to the lowest common denominator when making policy. The electorate is ill-informed and uninterested, unless it affects them directly.  However, mainstream publications can be equally bad. Compare the Economist to Business Week, News Week or Time Magazine, and you will see the latter are 'news lite'. It is not real journalism. It is a form of entertainment for when you are sitting on the thrown and have nothing better to do. If you are lucky you may learn some little known fact that you might otherwise not have seen, but they are hardly a serious medium for stimulating thought or discussion. By now, you are thinking I am a pretty serious guy? Sometimes, although I tend to read everything I can get my hands on, including the not so serious. One of the things I like to do when I read an article is to think who might also benefit from it, and then I send them a copy of the article via email. If I have already read it, the marginal cost in terms of time and effort to forward it is not zero, but close to it.  I am kind of like a spammer, except my aim is to entertain and enlighten with humorous and thoughtful articles, to fight against intellectual atrophy. It is an excellent way to keep in contact with friends, family, colleagues &amp; ex-colleagues, ex-classmates, and ex-professors, if you take time to send them something worthwhile to read. Better than just sending jokes all the time. I save them for Friday afternoons.  eRelationships are just like the real ones. They take a lot of time and effort to cultivate, and I send more emails than I receive. Just like friends drift apart with time and distance, online friends seem to come and go depending on what's going on in the rest of their life. I really do appreciate real friendships and work hard to maintain them. An added problem with online relationships is that they are so easy to disrupt. I have spent months corresponding with someone, getting to know them, and then they just lose interest and start to slip away. Perhaps they get bored or just have other things to do. Not that it was a waste of time, but just a real shame. Just like meeting people, getting to know them, finding them interesting, and then never seeing or hearing from them again.  Old friends are the best friends. They have survived the ups and downs, and still managed to keep in touch. When you have only the written word to communicate with someone, and only inhabit a virtual word, you have to be very careful what you write and how you write it, not to offend anyone. That often means not having any controversial opinions. However, that is dull. You have to learn to argue online without getting offended. You may have your opinions and others theirs', but unless you can argue persuasively you are not always going to convert everyone to your own point of view. And, rightly so, because over time if you are thoughtful and intelligent you may change your stance as new information becomes available. Shame if you alienated someone in the meantime just because you were inflexible and quick to take offense.  So what do I hope to achieve with this blog? I just want to practice writing and expressing my thoughts. If I go back in a few weeks or months, and read what I have written and don't like it, then I will know I have to write better and with more purpose. Other than that, it is a way to verbalize in print my collective thoughts about what I have read and what I am thinking at the moment. Hopefully it will help me organize my strands of thoughts and give them a voice. At least clarify the jumble of ideas currently bouncing around in my head. If someone enjoys reading what I have written, that would be an added bonus. I like constructive criticism, but I am not interested in defending my opinions from those who will never agree to disagree, as I have seen in so many forums and chat rooms. If you do not like what I write, don't read it. There are many other places you could be expressing your own thoughts, or lack of them, as the case may be.  Have a great day and speak to you soon.  Bill.

       Dear  urlLink British Airways ,  Our dreadfully run, recently State-owned, still majority controlled, over-unionized national airline, finds itself unable to compete in terms of price or service with much leaner, more efficient airlines, such as yours and others, within European airspace. Not withstanding the competition you may be facing from  urlLink low-cost airlines , undermining your own cost structure, it is quite embarrassing to our first world country, third world mentality, to have to continually subsidize, and more than occassionally bail-out, our own national carrier. To let it change into foreign hands or to let it become defunct, in light of so many other embarrassing corporate fiascos, such as  urlLink Parmalat  and Fiat, is more than this government and Italians' pride can bear at the moment. Therefore, this court, although it has no jurisdiction in such matters, must insist that you immediately stop undercutting  urlLink Alitalia  fares or face the consequences.  It is afterall in the spirit of European cooperation, that our government has prevailed on the European Central Bank to stop investing in German and other high quality European government bonds, and instead discretely increase their purchase of  urlLink government of Italy bonds  to support the credit spread between various national governments within the ERM, which allows our government to go on issuing debt at irresponsible levels without having to make difficult fiscal choices, such as cutting state aid to ailing Italian companies. Of course, we only see these stop-gap measures as being a short-term solution until our Italian politicans are able to wrest more permanent and significant aid from Brussels, or successfully lobby them to make competition based on  urlLink price and service  illegal, as they clearly undermine the solidarity of all European workers and their unions.  Once again, we must ask your airline to stop making us look ridiculous or else.  Your sincerely,  The Italian Magistrate. Rome, July 29, 2004.  p.s. Please do not respond directly to this email, but route all further enquiries through the European Commission, as this court is adjourned for the month of August to observe the Italian tradition of taking the month-off as holiday, and using some of our 42-days of vacation per year.  c.c. Lufthansa Airways Mr.  urlLink Mario Monti , European Competition Commission Union representatives for Alitalia, Fiat, and Italian Public Sector  b.c.c. EDF &amp; the government of France

       Everyone is framing everything at the moment as how each singular event affects Bush? Like Friday's  urlLink disappointing payroll numbers . What do over-stretched consumers and a  urlLink bumpy recovery  have to do with politics, so much as being about over-extended debtors looking for a quick fix to their problems or someone to blame? Can  urlLink Kerry-Edwards  to do a better job? Highly doubtful given their combined lack of experience. I am not saying  urlLink Bush  isn't going to get punished in November, maybe he deserves it, but the Democrats did no one a favor, least of all Americans, with their choice of candidate and his running mate. Oh well, Americans will get the government they deserve, and will someday learn there are no quick fixes. Well, not a lot of comfort for everyone else, I guess.  The headline I saw was to the effect, 'dollar, stocks and bond yields hammered on jobs report', as if falling bond yields &amp; higher bond prices by themselves, or a stronger or  urlLink weaker dollar  by itself, was cause for concern? I guess when you run record budget and trade deficits, a weaker dollar may be welcome? I thought  urlLink lower inflation  dangers were a good thing, unless they threaten to ignite deflation and  urlLink lack of consumer confidence ? Oh well,  urlLink get rid of Bush , and then all the problems with unfunded pension liabilities, and unfunded medicare and prescription drug benefits for a burgeoning aging population of baby boomers, will be solved.  urlLink Iran  will not build a nuclear bomb. And, magically the problems in  urlLink Iraq  will disappear with  urlLink France  and  urlLink Germany  lining-up along side of the USA and Britain to  urlLink heal that warn torn country . The world's largest ever debtor country will learn to consume less and save more. Democrats will convince Americans of the benefits of smaller cars and public transport, wean them off  urlLink SUVs , so they are no longer dependent of  urlLink foreign oil , and can retreat from world  urlLink political intervention . Then the  urlLink UN  can finally start doing its job without the  urlLink US  always interfering with  urlLink China's  and  urlLink Russia's  ever-constructive multi-party plans for a multi-polar world.  I can hardly wait for Hillary in 2008. Then the  urlLink world's largest economy  will be truly the best managed from the Oval Office since its Confederation.

       I normally like to send such articles to others because I find them so bizarre?&nbsp; Here I have reprinted this article from the The Moscow Times.&nbsp;&nbsp; So what did you learn at summer camp, Johnny?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   News / Crime  Monday, July 26, 2004    urlLink Busted Summer Camp Taught Teens to Steal   By Carl Schreck Staff Writer   Summer camp is a tradition dating back to Soviet times, when children were instilled with the values of the communist system. But some ex-convicts on Sakhalin Island have turned this tradition on its head, organizing a summer camp to train a new generation of criminals.  Police on the island have broken up a camp run by ex-convicts to teach young people the art of theft and robbery, a police spokesman for the Sakhalin region said Friday.   The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said police in the Uglegorsk district received an anonymous phone call informing them that dozens of young people were living at a campground in a forest near the Kamenka River.   When police arrived, they found several tents set up, a cafeteria and a diesel-powered generator. At the camp were more than 30 teenagers who had had previous run-ins with local police, including some who had been convicted of various crimes, including theft, the spokesman said.   The police spokesman would not say how many adults were running the camp, noting only that two of them were Uglegorsk residents and both had served time in prison. He did not specify of what crimes they had been convicted.   The situation became clearer when police discovered printed materials with information on various tricks for committing theft and robbery, explaining the hierarchy in the world of thieves and giving advice on how to act after being arrested.   The spokesman said police were trying to determine whether the camp was the only one of its kind, or whether similar camps were being held elsewhere or had been held before.  The teenagers apparently were attending the camp at no charge. The spokesman declined to speculate on whether the adult leaders were planning to organize a criminal youth group and take a cut of the teenagers' earnings.   He would not say whether a criminal case had been opened, and it was unclear exactly what the applicable criminal charges would be in this case.   "We're looking into it, but probably something like corrupting a minor," the spokesman said.  Under the Criminal Code, luring a minor into "committing anti-social actions," such as abusing drugs or alcohol, working as a prostitute, running away from home or begging, is punishable by up to four years in prison.
