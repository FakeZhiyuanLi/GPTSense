      Today was fun. I managed to get out of the house and have a walk and also have fun at Beth's house. Seeing as it is 11:51pm, i'm tired and i'm a lazy bugger, i will just excert my day from Beth's blog.    "It started with both Hannah and Casey being very late 2 arrive at mi house. Hannah missed her first bus and was stranded at Chatswood while some hobo chased her round saying "Help me find my family! I've lost them!" Haha, would only happen 2 Hanni.... Casey, being the lazy bum she is, slept in and didn't get round 'till 10.30! We had 2 giv her a wake up call. And we pranked her house and left a message on the answering machine saying, "Hello, this is Dr. Al-Ka-Sher-Ba from the pregnancy clinic, and we have Mr. B Hinde's test results. (KC's bro) Could you please call back as soon as possibe on 9451 8117. Thanks!" Once both parties arrived, we basically did, well nuthing!! We had the music up very loud tho. Taking full advantage of Foxtel digital by using their new radio channels. :D And we went onto sum randoms blog and told him Casey wanted 2 go out with him. And we successfully managed 2 cut off a lock of Casey's hair!! Excellent... Then came the infamous pizzas....  We decided 2 order pizzas, and Hannah called up hoping 2 speak 2 Dougie, but she got sum random ass lady, who said, "That will be $17.20. Thanks! Bye!" And hung up, while we stood there baffled, because it was only 'sposed 2 be $14.95 and we didn't have enuf money. So we spent the next half an hour trying 2 figure out how 2 get $2 (possible solutions - sell lemonade, sell hannahs fone, beg, busk, ask pizza guy 2 let us off $2 because our dog had died and finally, to sell casey) Eventually I just put in sum of mi Noumea money. SO neway, the pizza guy was realli late, and Casey goes, "Wouldn't it be funni if your Mum came home right now!" She jinxed it!! Then about 2 seconds later, mi Mum drove down the driveway, while the pizza guy was following the car (we weren't realli allowed 2 order pizza we don't think) So we're like "Shit, she's home!" And KC and Hanni ran into mi room 2 hide, and so i went outside 2 face the music, and the pizza guy had disappeared!! Like totally vanished. So Mum had come home from school just 2 put out the washing, and we were offering 2 help her, 2 get her out of the house quickly, but she wouldn't let us. She ended up going tho! Finally! We got away with it! So the pizzas STILL hadn't arrived and there was the mystery of the missing pizza dude. We could hear his motorbike in the background. So Hanni called up the lady 2 complain. And she's like "Blah, Blah, Blah, I don't care!" and so we hung up, and then the doorbell rang and it was the pizza guy, and to Hanni's dismay, he wasn't hot. He was like 60 and ugly! He denied he got lost when KC asked him, but we think he was lying just 2 save face! :P So we ate our pizzas, forcing ourselves to eat 5 pieces each!! Ahhh, we were like bursting!! So that was mi fun day with KC and Hanni!"    Yeh so, Yeh. Well, bi. LOluv CM

      Decided to write 'bout my day: Today  Bubs, Beff, Morto, Han, Loz and I  all went to Chatswood to see   Mean Girls  . It was a bit of a  steriotypical chick flick , but quite funny. Even the intelligent standards of Lauren gave surprising approval. Yeh so, afterwards we all felt kinda bloated from our boost juices that we had during the movie, we decided to work it off by shopping...Yay...After a while we worked up an appetite so we got some fast food and sat next to a scary bumb. We decided to go to Timezone, except not for the  i-take-your-money-and-stuff-up-your-game  machines but for the  i-take-your-picture-and-cut-off-your-head  machine. We managed to get 6 people in the one little photo! Its a world record i tell you. It was one of those neopick machines not a passport one by the way. Yeh so after decorating our now unseeable wallets with stickers we decided to head off home. Bubs took Han, Beff and i to Ellen's restaurant b4 Beff and i got our bus. I expected it to be like a random little take-away place, but surprisingly they had this full nice sit-down restaurant thing happening. On our way back to the bus stop Han and I bought two nice white fluffy identical scalves. I have needed one for so long. Yeh, so that's about it, Beff and I got on our Davo bus and went home, and lived happily ever after.  Well, that was my day. Feel free to comment bout ur boring day. (poor Davo pplz) LOlove CM PS. I cant wait to go to sleep and have a sleep in, i got up at like 7 this morning, i guess it was the price i had to pay.

      It all happened one innocent afternoon at the Macquarie Ice Rink. Yesterday arvo to be exact. Sarah and Gemma were skating slow so un-co me could catch up, when a fat little asian boy skated up and said "Your so slow" to gemma. The only reason she was going slow was bcoz of me, so i told gem to skate past him and say "well, atleast im not fat" (im such a hipocryt). Neway she said to me she didn't wanna diss a lil kid, so instead we tagged him "Stumpi", a pj to live on 4ever...I decided to skate over to him and ask what his name was, but as soon as the words left my lips, he was gone. After a while i saw his chubby torso again and skated over to him to ask again. "What is your name?" he skated ahead pretending he hadnt heard. A while later our eyes locked and next thing i knew he was getting off the rink.  I lost the chance to meet the man of my dreams....sych . Once my group was off the ice and out the front of the centre waiting for out snail of a teacher, i saw his school pass. When i spotted him i decided to give the innocent, beady eyed, singing school boy one more chance to answer. He approached with caution singing silently to himself as i stood at the door. I asked again and, and, and, he ignored me once again still singing his Yu-gi-oh tune. Bummer. Meh, i think i would've liked Stumpi better than his real name. That one is gold, it gives off vibes. I hope i taught him a lesson " never diss older pplz, or ur stuffed 4 life "

      I am so happy! I have worked my butt off this term, I had heaps of study, the infamous camp where SIMBA resides, half yearly exams, assignments and lots of other things i consistently stressed about. However that is all the past now, and i can just live for 3 weeks without any stresses, i hope. It has been 26 hrs since school broke out and i have already found my self stressing about my history project that i accidently left at school, which is due on the second day back. Oh-oh. N eway, the last day of school ran pretty smoothly. I had CPT, where i just scraped in my web site for marking, then maths; most of the time i was being told off by Mrs. Wilson for talking to Hannah. Then, suddenly she disappeared. It was so strange, 1 second she is helping me with a question, i say thnx, then i say "Wait..." and i look up and at the front of the class another teacher said "right, so, how r we going?" Im like, Dude, Where's my...TEACHER?!. Neways, then i went and got a krispy kreme and watched the slave auction for awhile b4 returning to my group. Apparently 2 slaves went for $60! (by one single person). Then in tutor time i had to swap lockers with amanda kiely. Not only did i have to get a bottom locker, but i had to move to the other side of the locker room, leaving all my friendly neighbours behind, to live in a ghetto locker space. Lol. Soon i found out Loz was also stuck in the ghetto, so it got better. After breaking my lock, trying to get it on my new locker, i went to science. My usual teacher was not there instead, i was stuck with Armi. Instead of staying in the classroom and slaving away, gem, ellen and i walked out and decided to find Batsie in the yr7 locker courtyard. (it is so easy cutting class wen u hav armi, she is so blind) He wasn't there but Mrs. Mitchel decided to give us jellybeans for skipping class, excelllent....Whoever said good deeds are rewarded was obviously a priss, because so do bad deeds. When we finally returned to class mrs. Armi was a bit grouchy, so we finished our work and went to english where we watched "Romeo+Juliet". That movie is weird. Afterwards we had the sports elective program so i got dressed and hopped on the bus to go to ice skating. It was heaps fun except for "stumpi"-actually i think he might've made it even funner...hmm... he deserves his own blog. Ne way once i got bak top school the bell went and i was on my way.

      I have been hearing all about  Mary-Kate Olsen  and her anorexia problems lately. I feel so sorry for her, i mean im not the biggest fan exacly but still its so sad. Specially since she is so well-known, it is such a big deal to all these news reporters that MK Olsen has gone to a tratment facility. Also because she is a twin i think it will be even harder bcoz they have grown up practically exacly the same appearence and as far as i know same overall nature and to have all these people suddenly talking 'bout her supposable case of anorexia would be horrific. (she might be judged next to her sister. If she was not a twin then there is no kind of contrast if you know what i mean. good twin bad twin sorta thing.) Also everyone in melbourne was like 'she is so slack' coz she didnt show up at Knox a couple of days ago and im like 'giv her a break! You know? She needs help'. If i was her i just wouldnt be able to handle it all. The constant pressure of the paparazzi and such in hollywood, itd be hard. To even take that first step of admitting it would not only be hard for a normal person but for her, in hours after she admits it like 1/3 of the population would like know. At least they are not like diss'ing her, that would be all too harsh.  She is human.  Apparently she had to be taken out of school to eat and also her land rover got taken away from her coz her father said they would only give it back if she eats more coz she had already had a crash, and they were scared her fragile frame would just crack. So lord i pray not only for MK but also for everyone out there who is in a similar sitch. Lolove CM

      I just reconnected myself with the internet yesterday, after about a week. Is it just me or is everyone talking about big words? Beth was saying something about her big word and so was Helen and im like WA? So i have decided to go find MY big word. One second, i need to go to the laundry and find myself a bottle of acid. Brb. Back. I found a big word: Presenting the soon to be infamous Casey's word:   Sodium-tripolyphosphate   That is now my word. I don't know how to pronounce it, i dont know what it is, and i dont know how it relates to me, but it is my word. TaTa for now (-tigger) Luv CM

      Mum just said something funny. Well, it was funny for me, depressing for her. She said  "You take the first twenty years of your life growing up, and the next fifty dying."  I find that funny. Wise mum. She doesn't think it's that funny, obviously. I think she got it from a book or something. CM PS. Does anyone know where i can get a claddagh ring without going to Ireland?

      This morning at Auburn i had my Grand Final of basketball. We played the infamous Kambala. We all were anxious because last time we played them one girl used her breath as a weapon. Dam it was bad. But, when we got to the courts the team we were supposebly playing for the second time, weren't those pplz (or so we thought) we didnt recognise any of them. Not even Miss. I-don't-brush-my-teeth. Neway, we played them scoring two goals in the first couple of minutes which kind of held a margin of 4 points between them and us the whole game. So at the end the score was Roseville 12 Kambala 6. Great game. Yay for us. But no more bball unfortunately. I wish it went for two seasons. Well i g2g steal crunchie chocolate from my dad. Ciao, CM.

      Let me start this post by saying:  WA?   Yr 11 Play. Pride and Prejudice. Review, due monday. Need i say more? OMgosh! Last night i went to see 'I have 5 daughters', a take off of Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice'. First of all i arrived at the play 10 min late, no surprise there really. (i was with dad). To make things worse when we got into the hall (all the lights off) dad took me down the middle of the isle only to find seats that were marked 'reserved'. Everyone was staring at us. I went to the back to sit in the seats i saw earlier, dad followed. I didnt understand much, at all really. We couldn't hear anything. We were right in front of the teachers, and when my dad dropped his phone on the ground with this echoing bang, Mrs Douglas gave dad the biggest greasy. Stuff her. I focused my attention to lipsinking again as my dad put his head in his hands. I bent over him and whispered "...only 3 more hours...". Excellent. The second half was not as bad. I decided to ditch dad and sit with Morto and Han. Dad didnt mind though, infact he insisted. I could actually hear from there. Although the play dragged on for too long...Today i did my review on it, the review itself is boring, but bloody brilliant coloured paper.  Cya 4 now, CM

      Everyone had gone to the hall at lunchtime to watch Hannah Sena and Beth dance. So after Julia and I sat in awkward silence for ten minutes we decided to join them. As we got there i saw Beth and Han fiddling with the CD player, and the rest of the group playing Basketball. I decided to join the b-ballers. We were just mucking around for awhile, no real teams, when i saw jacki on the opposite side of the court preparing to pass the ball to Bubs. The quick thinker that i was, i decided to run infront of Bubs and jump for the passing ball. Unfortunately it was more of a dive, a dive that i forgot to  land . Instead of landing triumphently on the polished wood (with the ball in my grasped hands), i seemed to be  diving horizontally  around one and a half metres from the floor. I don't exacly remember how i landed but i remember i was in pain. Not like blood pain, just aching. Everywhere. I quickly pulled down my skirt and looked around. Everyone was either laughing or seeing whether i was OK, how  embarrassing . I don't think i even got the ball. I was curled in a heap on the floor, when i heard Ozzy's booming voice  "That's it, everyone, OUT!".  Well, actually i don't remember that, i was told she said that later. Jess and Gemma pulled me up, i was doing nothing, just trying to pull myself down to the floor. They finally got me up, practically dragging me to the stairs. What was even worse, is that whenever people tried to cheer me up by saying something funny, tears came bursting out of my eyes! I told them to not make me laugh, but i don't think they understood, so as we were walking up the stairs, everyone still trying to make me laugh, i couldn't take it anymore, and ran to the bathrooms. That was my story of how i  'fought the law of gravity ', my  superman  experience, my stupid attempt to be a bird.  Lots of love , Casey-Mai. Ps. Normally (in past years and terms) my stockings would only go without a hole for a maximum of 3 days before i somehow found a way to make them look like fish nets. From the begginging or Term 2 'till today i was making a record of a  gobsmacking  six weeks! When i fell over today i made a massive hole in the front.-there goes my winning streak.

      Here i am in front of the computer, covered in flour marks. I have just made orange and poppy seed muffins.  (*snifffff*)   ah....i can smell them cooking...I am not that good of a cook, i just use those box recipes where the only thing you have to add is 100mL cold water. Simple. Yet still i always get stains all over me or make them too gooey or burn them. Its the casey lifestyle. Mmm...the best thing 'bout making cakes is licking the bowl...whenever my mum is around she quickly rinses the bowl while i'm puting the muffins in the oven to burn. But not today, today i've mastered the art of holding the bowl firmly with my right hand, opening the oven door with my chin, and putting the muffins in with my left hand. Truly brilliant. Big step for me. Next i may even be able to put the muffins down and then open the oven door with my  hand , then pick the muffins up and put them in the oven! What a day that shall be... Oh crud! I forgot! My muffins! G2G! Luv Kc

      In four subjects today i attempted falling asleep. Maths, Art, CPT and English. I successfully drifted off in Maths and English, lucky me. I had a dream in english that i fell down a well, everything else is kind of a blur, then i remember something prodding me, then a really violent prod. I heard a distant person say "Stop that Ellen", i woke up to see Ellen and Mrs. Atmore staring down at me. The bell had gone and i gathered my books and scuttled off to the next desk to sleep on.  Why is it that I always have dreams in english not maths? Is it something to do with mrs atmore's soothing voice? Odd. Maybe it is bcoz in maths whenever i drift away to another dimension i can always feel Hannah drawing towns (you heard me) on my arms and face... Neway, i am so buggered. My daily routine is get up, got to school, come home and watch angel, miss the last half of Angel because i fall asleep, watch buffy, miss the last half buffy bcoz i fall asleep again, then have dinner, and fall asllep again in front of the TV. What really annoys me is when i fall asleep during angel, and my bro comes up to me and takes the remote from my tight grasp, and wen i finally wake up, he has tyaken over the TV.  Do not think i am really obsessed with TV. It's just we got robbed and the insurance company has finally coughed up a new TV, after like 3 months, so i was like entertainment-deprived for so long, now that i have the TV bak i never wanna leave it.  (*Yawn...*) I can't wait for dinner. The best things in life begin with 'f's. Eg.  Food, Friends, Family, Fun,  and i suppose  the Father . ehe. I fank the farva for these few fings. ehe. that is so lame. luv kc. I cant remember wot i was writing bout...

      I'm just listening to Britney's newest song,  everytime . It is so sad, i don't like her that much but this song makes me feel sorry for her. She sings it really well. I'm guessing it is about JT...(duh?) Here it is, the chorus:    Everytime I try to fly, I fall Without my wings, I feel so small I guess I need you, Baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you, Baby    Why is it that alot of songwriters write songs that relate to the artist (singer)? Do they sit down with the artist and brainstorm ideas from the latest traumas in the artist's life? It is odd.  I like it. What is she trying to portray? An apology maybe? It is a big contrast from her last two songs, Toxic and Me Against the Music. Reminds me of Xtina's step down from 'Dirty' to 'Beautiful'...although that was a dare (apparently). Brits should just get over him...man, he's not even that good looking. What ever happened to Love's immortality? Maybe this is the song I should sing on the Middle School Performing Arts night. (haha beth...) I like the tune, but unfortunately i can't relate to the lyrics. (as in a unfortunately in a singing POV, not like 'i wish sum1 just broke my heart'). Sorry this post has been meaningless...just thinking... Luv Casey-Mai  PS. Beth!  Is this meaningful!? I tried hard. :( I just blabbered on about things with no meaning....that is what every1 else does. Should I cram it with rhetorical questions!??

      I am soooo tired. On Saturday morning i got up to go to basketball, where i got a box of Krispy Kremes (excellent) and played a bitchy game of b-ball. We played St. Vincents and they were so dam fiesty. The umpires weren't giving any fouls so one girl from Vini's fully slapped Hannah in the face, and the ref still didn't do nuffin'. By the end of the match everyone was just like hitting everyone, it was kinda fun. Ehe. The bright side is that  good people NEVER lose . Which I kept thinking and we ended up winning, the semi's. Later that day I went to Morto's party at Pino's Pizzeria. The guy who owned the restaurant was fully having a sycho attack bcoz we were being to loud. He was like muttering thing under his breath at us. Afterwards Mel, Beth, Hannah, Gem, Lozza and I all slept at Gemma's house where we watched phone booth and then a Viva La Bam-a-thon. (excellent....that guy is soo funny). After not much sleep we ate  retarded burnt pancakes  and watched Silence of the Lambs. Which was a really good movie. Hannah was like pissing herself though. Anyway my mum picked me up and i went to my first baby shower. (not mine). The baby was soo cute and he gave me chocolate...which reminds me........I'm back. You probably didn't know i left, but i did, i got the rest of Dyl's smooshed chocolate. Any way, i just got home from church, which hannah bludged by the way. I feel sorry for joel, he must be totally freaked. Anyway...im probably boring you with my un-meaningful post ( as all posts seem to be nowadays, meaningfull) so i will go. A-du, a-du, to yer und yer und yerrrr. (hehe) Luv Casey-Mai, bloggin' off...

      I have just got back from small group. Ehe. How fun. Everyone was too tired to do anything though. But we attempted to learn about Titus. I prayed for a girl at school who's mum died last night. So many people were crying, i don't even know the girl but it was all so emotional. She was apparently diagnosed with it 2 weeks ago and died yesterday. She has two daughters at roseville and so everyone in their years had tears in there eyes. (*sniff*sniff*) What's even worse is that their father wants nothing to do with them. So many people are dying from cancer lately it is soo sad. Pip's grandpa has bowel cancer, my mum's good friend has just died of cancer, my dad's mum died of cancer and her sister two weeks ago. Also my dad's friend and now this poor girl at school. So everyone who is reading this right now, this is a reminder to  live life to the max . Luv Casey-mai Ps.  urlLink Beth  i am trying to do this link thing....it is not working!

      After getting home from the rocks, i cleaned my room, then retired in front of the heater. Unfortunately, i drifted off, only to wake at 6 pm, with a really red nose (coz it was resting on the heater) and a burnt pinky finger. I don't know where it was resting but it is like this white bubble and it is really stinging.

          Today we had our [new] small group's social. So Fi, Han, Helen, Ash, Nat, Beth, Anika and I all met up at Glenrose and caught a bus to Wynyard to go have pancakes on the rocks. Yum. When we got there we mat up with Jess and we all ordered. Han, Jess, Beth, Ash and I all had this huge plate of 2 chocolate pancakes, surrounded with strawberries, topped with cream and ice-cream and then smothered in chocolate. It was soooo filling. Before eating it we were all soo hungry, then 2 mouthfulls later we were all rubbing our stomachs. In the end everyone got like half way through theirs and then gave up. We then all played with our food for a while, making faces in it and stuff. Afterwards we all split up and had a wonder around the markets. Everyone was overwhelmed by the tempting chocolates and bought fudge bars and strawberry chocolate things. Not me, they were tempting, but i think i have had enough chocolate to last a life time. Well maybe not that long. ehe. Instead i bought some candy from 'the rocks candy kitchen'. Mmm...Yeh well, we caught a bus back to Glenrose and all went our seperate ways. cm

          Well, i just got home from my Kambora school reunion. It was soo much fun! We went to the President Hotel. I can't believe how much everyone has changed! Like all the guys are a foot taller and actually half decent! Amazing. Harry, where to start. He is as funny as ever, he used to have such a possy voice in P.S. And now, now, he is like really, really deep. I mean, i used to do like duets with him and stuff, and i just can't believe how different he and his voice&nbsp;is. I forgot that Eleanor was such a nice hilarious person. Eleanor is like the knife that cuts the tension. She is soo funny, most of the night we just sat there remembering old times, getting half way through a story and bursting out in laughter. She reminded me of the time Max got a pen up his butt, Shima got a pen up her nose, James sat on pip's arm and broke it and the infamous time when Lazar, on September 11 (terrorist attacks) said to Eleanor "I know who the terrorist was. I will tell you if you if you kiss me. Or even just pat me." Eleanor responded by patting him, and the next second, he scouted the area around them, slowly leant towards her and whispered "Mike...". Lol. Vanessa was as sophisticated as ever. Laura and Karlie are identical. So qte. Luke has a mini 'fro. Sarah is so gorgus...Wiso! Wiso know1 believes that chris actually became popular-they just laughed unbelievingly.  Good times...  LOluv CM

          I have problems. I bite my nails, pens, pencils, textas, (basically anything chewable). Ever since i was young. When i was a baby i chewed videos and tapes and one time, mum was taking apart her camera and she put the battery on the ground next to me, and next minute she went to pick it up and it wasn't there. She looked at me, just in time to see me gulping (swallowing) something. Guess what it was. Yeh so anyway, i was without a pen that was working today (on a account of i chewed my other ones so much that they all either don't work, are falling apart, or had to be chucked in the bin coz i chewed it for too long and the ink spilled all in my mouth...but that's another story) Yeh so im sitting in class and i was like " Em....can i borrow a pen" (in an innocent voice of course) and she's like "Yeh, but don't even think about chewing it! It is a special pen i got for my birthday, it's imported from Switzerland (as hannah said anyway)" yeh so she gave me her precious precious pen, and everytime it crept towards my mouth she would take it back. At the end of the period i forgot to give it back to her, so i went to Commerce with it. In commerce i couldn't seem to find the lid. I searched everywhere, but still know sign of it. I was freakin' by that time. She would kill me. At least i still had her pen. Wait! "WHERE DID I PUT HER PEN!!!??" I bellowed at the supposably 'innocent' hannah. She stood there layghing as i got down on all fours and searched the room.&nbsp;Know where. Just as i had come to the conclusion that it magically disappeard, i once again heard hannah's hysterics and marched&nbsp;over to her&nbsp;damanding Emma's pen bak. Sghe insisted she didn't have it as i started to interrogate the rest of the&nbsp;terrorised class. By lunch time, i figured i should probably tell Emma b4 my friends found her. I sat with my friends untill i saw Emma. When her head bopped up from the stairs, i choked on my tiny teddies from half laughing half crying.&nbsp;As i stood and took the much dreaded walk toward her, she stopped and just stared at me. I think she was as terrified as i was. She looked as if i was gonna tell her that Spud Fairy died or sumthing. N eway, as i could hear my friends laughing in the background i decided to take her behind the stairs so they couldnt here our convasation or see us. I slowly told her the story, and i was surprised to see how well she took it. Honesty pays off. I offered to pay for it, but she sed dont worry. It is quite crazy but i think i felt dissappointed that she didnt make a scene. It would've been superb if she stood up and yelled obsentities and threw stuff at me and such, but i could see that i wasnt gonna get that out of her, so i whispered in her ear "can u atleast pretend to be mad?". She looked at me, and then bak at my eager looking friends, and with that she stood up and yelled "SHIT Casey!!" and stormed off. It was brilliant! Gold stuff. Yeh so that was my day. TTFN-CM

      I never knew that P.O.D. was such a religious band. I've always liked them, but never really listened to their earlier lyrics. Practically all their early songs are to do with christianity. (im not sure bout their recent ones)  Kudos!        "I live my life for Christ, but you live how you choose. We rock a show, we rock some more, He gets the glory, 'Cause this is how we preach his word and tell his story. 'Cause when it comes to my God, there ain't no playing around, we either get on our knees, or we can get down, and we can get down. So, come and get some of this christianity. Dedicated my life, now I'm a soldier of G.O.D. " That is from 'Get it straight'. And from 'Preach' "If it wasn't for my God, I would of already had you. Deny his name are you willing to admit it and if so are you willing to die for it. Cuz I am, He is my life and I don't have to fear death because he already paid the price." and lastly in 'Coming back' "No need for us to go down, the truth is what we know how. That we have life through my Lord Jesus Christ, no one can love you more, than to do the things that he did. So give him your pass, so that he can start to mold ya, Full-Fledged, dedicated, hardcore, christian soldier." Plenty more where they came from. TTFN-kc

          Omg! Today Mum and I went to Warringah Mall to get me some clothes, shoes and to sign up for this softball thing. When we got there we decided to take a quick look in PetWorld. Coincidently, the exact breed of puppies that we were looking for happened to be there! Chihuahua x Jack Russell. They were sooo cute. There was two of them, cuddled up with each other in the corner. Together they were like the size of my hand. I fell in love instantly. The bad thing tho is that during the day on weekdays know one is home...so&nbsp;it would be very lonely. Then we thought 'bout buying the two of them but it would be quite expensive. Neway, we did our shopping then realised that we should foster them for the night. We went bak, but unfortunately they were already being fostered for 2nite. If they are still there next friday or saturday then we will foster them. Awww...i can't wait! LOluv CM

      Aw...It was sooo annoying today. Get this. After sport the teachers were like taking snail steps and everyone was like "hurry up!!!" and so finally everyone was on the bus and it was like 10 past, so 5 min later we arrived bak at skool, so we got there just after the bell (3:15). Ellen, Sammy-G, Mel, Beth and I all sprinted to our bags, where we decided to just put our blazers and skirts on. After that we thought it looked to weird and noticible, so we took off our sneakers and put our stockings and skool shoes on. So we all looked decent (except for mel n ellen, who didnt bother changing) and the only thing different bout our uniform was that we had our sports top underneath our blazer and jumper. Well Guess what...? Good news or bad news first? Good news. We successfully caught our correct bus. Bad news. Guess who happened to have bus stop duty today?  Renalds . The deputy princible. The First [ evil ] (buffy thang). Yeh so she happily gave us all  detentions  and was about to make us go bak and get changed (and miss our bus) except that mel saved us and sed she would b l8 for community service. Ne ways, i just got bak from our VERY BIG small group. It was a merge of Tanya and Helen/Rach's small groups. Yay! Ne way we just talked and ate 4 a while untill we started the small group topic which was  worship . Great fun ! Wow, im havin de ja vu. Excellent. Neways, we sed some words of worship to god and sang a bit, and yeh... LOluv, TTFN-(tata4now, as tigger always sed) CM

           Yesterday was fun fun! During the day i went to Luna Park with Karlie, Rach, Dan and&nbsp;myself. We basically spent the whole day going on heaps of rides,&nbsp;feeling sick, then going on heaps more. Ehxcellllent...Later on, i arrived&nbsp;home at around 6:15pm&nbsp;and recieved a phone call from Mel asking me to come over 4 the night. After being picked up by a complete stranger from squash, that drove me to Mel's, Beth, Mel and I all went to Cristian City Church for youth group.When we got there, we were totally lost, we soon found Rory. He told us to go downstairs. After going downstairs and following the noise&nbsp; we were greeted at the door by the Tom equivelant. He opened the door for us and said something i didn't quite catch bcoz of the loud music. It was so weird. They had this big room, with music just rumbling in side it. The speakers were like double the size of me, and they had a DJ and all this other random stuff. There was no point trying to&nbsp;talk to each other coz we couldnt hear anything coz of the music. It was like sum random cult night club. lol. Ne way, we wanted to ask Rory when the 'youth group' actually started' but he was not there coz he was a youth leader with the younger youth group. Eventually beth felt sick bcoz of the vibrations so we went into the hallway. After multiple SOS attempts on Beth's mobile, we found ourselves huddled in the corner, all alone. It was quite funny, one guy started coming down the hallway and he goes "Hey!..." then he realised he didnt know us and turned around, that happened 3 times. Luke finally got a hint and called Beth.     We went outside in the cold, so we could hear him. Mel asked for the phone and when Beth handed it to her, Mel bolted inside, up the stairs, down the corridor and into a random seminar room, collapsing onto the tables at the back. Beth and I following. All the while Luke was on the phone like "Beth?....What's happening?....Beth?.....Hello!?...".  After Beth spoke to Luke for another 5 min, we decided to check out the room. It was about the size of 2 of the playgroup rooms next to St. Stevo's. It had a white board up the front, and the room was surrounded with cupboards. It was all pitch black by the way, we could nly see things faintly. Eventually, we found a TV. We turned it on hoping it would work. It did. Yay! We stayed there for like an hour watching Miss Match, and Tru Calling.  During that time i went to the back cupboard labeled "KIDS" and opened it to find a big jar of Starburst Sucks lollypops. Yum... we each took two and settled ouselves back down on the carpet to watch the rest of Tru Calling. It was soo funny. Here we were at CCC, in a seminar room, watching TV, and sucking lollypops we stole from kids. lol. We could still here the faint rumble of sound from downstairs even though the room was soundproof. After a while Guy finally came to pik us up and we went bak to Melly's to sleep over. LOluv, cm

      Today i am devoting myself to my art homework,  oh joy . This consists of taking a walk and collecting anything and everything that is natural. (*sarcasm*)  That won't take long . (*sarcasm*) Neway, i am so sick of Art, more just the teacher,  Mrs. Borger . She is so cruel. If you ask a simple question, she will randomly start screaming and yelling at everyone. It comes to the point where we are not learning anything, because know one has the guts to ask her a question. Neways, also today my neighbour is coming over to give me a present. It's quite funny actually. For the last week and a half mum has been collecting their mail and puting their bins out while they were on holidays. Yesterday they came back, so mum went over with their mail, and Joanne [my neighbour] said  "Oh, thankyou soo much, i will come over tomorrow and give a special treat to Casey..."  and Mum is like  "errr....great".  lol. So now i get a lil prezzie for all mums hard work. I feel guilty, but mum says she doesn't mind. LOluv, kc.

      Wow! I am finally blogging again! My internet has been screwed so i havn't blogged in the past week. I will just give you a recap of the week, then i will tell you what i did today. Eh-xcellent...   Wednesday   I didn't do much during the day, but at night i went to the Quarantine Station for a ghost tour. It was kinda scary. The tour guide was blabbering on about something in the showers, then he said "...And it sounded a bit like this..." and with a 'bang!' he knocked on the tin shower walls, which made a huge sound, and the second he did it, me n rach were in each others arms screaming. It was funny, in hindsight n e way. Just before going in there [the showers] tho, it was really dark and he was talking outside and everyone in the back row, simultaneously turned their heads. We [ i was in the back row] all heard footsteps running down the path we had just followed! We all looked at each other and then at everyone else that hadnt heard, sketch, eh? Two other scary things happened. 1) Glenda was walking up some stairs in the dark, following everyone else, and she felt someone tap her on her back, and when she turned, she saw that she was the last person, no-one was behind her. 2) Also my friend Rach has hardly ever got a nosebleed before and the second she entered the hospital wing, blood just came trickling out of her nose. The tour man was saying, "...The people often had really bad flues aswell, some were coughing up blood...", coincidence or not?   Thursday  I honestly can't remember....talk to beth, she knows all about my memory skills.   Friday  I can't remember what i did during the day, but at night, our family friends came over for dinner. Karlie and her family had just come back from China, and they brought me a Louis Vuitton bag, Shrek 2 (DVD), a kimono dressing gown and a toothbrush. (lol). Great Fun. Joods came over aswell.   Saturday  I had a fairly bummy day, i just kept Nanna company and read my book. How fun. Good book. Ne way, in the evening Dan and Rach came over to sleep. Pop gave us a lift up to Glenrose and back to buy supplies for the night, yum. We had 8 DVDs ready for us to watch, in order and everything. We watched Charlie's Angels, Legally Blonde and School of Rock, and decided to go to sleep anyway. So much for the movie marathon.    Sunday  Sunday i had my dad's special pancakes for brekky, then dan rach and i just mucked around for a bit, 'till their mum came. Once they left, i decided to watch Honey, great movie that. Yeh so, later on i went to church, then maccas, then home. Fun.   Monday  On monday i went to the movies and saw NY min. It was surprisingly really good, i liked it.  And finally...   TODAY!!!  Today was great! My family is thinkin' 'bout getting a dog, and my fave dogs r chiwouwa's and pug's. So i decided to go with the Humphrises and Karen Atkins (soon to be mega famous artist, hehe) to a little house about 1 and a half hours drive from sydney, where they bred adorable pug's! It was so cool. When we first arrived, around 30 dogs (pugs) were at the gate jumping up trying to get through. They were soooo qte. The black ones were too, they were like lil demons. We knocked at the door, and eventually an old lady came out and told us to come in. As we entered, we saw two black pugs playing together and a cream one. As we followed her further into her house, we went in a room where on the gound was a basket full of 5-day-old pugs! They were the qtest things i had ever seen. They were smaller than my cupped hand and soo soft. As we crept in further we saw another litter of about 12 little week old pugs, curled up with their chubby mummy. After patting them all, she led us into another room where we saw 3 more extremely qte lil pugs. All cream in colour. After all picking them up and playing with them for a while, Karen was told which one hers was. Although they were adorable, i don't think i am gonna get a pug. They r way too expensive and i don't think my family wants a pug. Dad thinks they're ugly. Neway, while Karen filled out the paperwork, the rest of us, climbed over the barrier to the backyard, where there were 30 pugs and 1 chiwouwa. As we climbed over all the pugs came and jumped up it was so overwhelming, but qte. I have said qte so many times, i guess it is the only way to describe it. After another hour or so playing with the pug babies, we finally were in the car. We stopped at a park for lunch where we had hamburgers n chips. Karen didn't have anything, she was just carressing over her new little baby, who was looking qter than ever, wrapped up in a towel, like a REAL baby. After a long drive home, we finally arrived. It was a great day! I have decided what sort of puppy i want. My couz has it. It is half chiwouwa and half [cant remember] something else. Yay, i cant wait, mum wants the same.  LOluv, kc.

      Today i went to the movies with Danielle and Rach. Yay. We decided to see the Prince and Me. Biggest chick flick ever made. I spose it is right up there with Legally Blonde and Mean Girls tho. My gosh! You should've seen the cinema! It was like double the size of my vicor-on-sunday room. (i dont know wot that means, that is what they call it). It was miniscule...it didnt help us being late, we had to sit in the first row. Neway, the movie was OK, a bit too mushy. Luke Mably (the prince dude) isnt really that qte...so that takes half of the movie goodness out. Ne way after the movie we had a bite to eat, then went SHOPPING! Dan was lookin' for a jumper, I a wallet, and Rach, well, nothing imparticular. Unfortunatelly Dan didn't find her jumper, but i got my wallet. I have needed one for soooo long! Yay! Wait a sec. Cloat is is screaming out 'MAI SAIIIIIIII!' over msn. Bak, she's one crazy girl. Yeh so now im at home, getting ready to watch James Masters on Rove 2nite! I am so excited, he rules. EVERYONE, WATCH IT! David especially. Neway, i better go watch the OC for Melly. TaTa4now... LOluv, kc.

      On thursday Beth, Peter (her father), Sue (her mother, i call her Mrs. Docker), Mi, Callum (her bros) and I all went to Canberra...  the hole of all holes  ...Sue said i should pack light, i took it seriously and brought a make-up bag. They were like "How the hell did you fit everything in there!?" i was like "excellent...". Neway, after much hassling and bickering we finally were all in the car, ready to fall into the hole, Canberra. After 2 minutes, Mi said "I'm hungry", we all laughed and Mrs. Docker said, "we are in Belrose!" i said, "ah...the twilight zone" (i don't know why i said that).  A while later we were on a main road and there had been a crash, so Peter decided to follow the other cars and go off into a little suburb to try to get to the main road on the other side. All the cars started coming in and this small little neighbourhood had a traffic jam outside there houses. It was soooo funny, all these people were coming out of it's houses, scratching their heads, wondering what was happening. All the lebanese women stood by the street with there head cloth things directing traffic, Beth and I were cracking up. This small suburb named Cheyorall or something, Beth and I had tagged "Lebanon". Here is the dialogue Beth and I remembered later that night.  Driving through the streets of  Lebanon .  Mi and Callum:  (*fart*fart*)  Stop pulling my hair! Michael! I'm hungry. Mum....Callum farted again! Peter: Look, now we're off the main road, a half an hour wait! I'll just drive up onto the sidewalk to get one car ahead... Sue: Don't you dare you impatient man! Caaalm down, just calm down. Beth: Be,  (*clap*)  agressive,  (*clap*)  be, be  (*clap*)  agressive! (cheerleading) Casey:  (*singing*)  We're all going on a  (*clap*)  summer holiday. Everyone:  SHUTUP CASEY!   Another thing Beth and I made up was...(*dadada*)   A Recipe for disaster  Take two physco farting boys, two uncontrollably argumentative parents and one cheerleader, put them into a car for five hours and you have Beth's disfunctional family. Add Casey into the mix, and you have hell!   As you can see, Beth and I had alot of time on our hands.  Once we were well and truly out of Sydney, we decided to stop at Maccas for lunch, where i was surprised to see a Mc Feacies burger was added to the menu. lol, yuk! Another two hours or so and after multiple games of "eye spy with my pussy bleeding eye" (as Mi put it) we finally arrived at our lodge. It was quit nice, except that Beth, Mi, Callum and I were cramped into a small room with bunk beds, it looked like a cabin on a ship. I recieved a text on my phone, when i opened it it said "where are you?" it was from my brother, barnabus. I texted bak and said "in canberra you loser!" he replied by texting back, "home". I had no idea what that meant. But it was so pathetic that he didn't know where i was.  Peter, Mi, Mrs. Docker and Callum all went out so Mi and Callum could train for their cycling comp. So they left Beth and I at home, with only 1 TV station, 2 degree warmth, no food (surviving on gum), we were bored out of our minds, found blood on the floor, were terrified and had no civilation. Finally Beth's phone rang and it turned out being Luke. Ahh...civilisation, or so i thought. Beth was on the phone for 45 min, so not only did i have no civilisation, i had no Beth! Stupi beth! I just sat there. Damn her! Later that night, we all went out for pizza at a nice little Italian restaurant. Beth and I shared a meatlovers pizza. Yum...Just as we were finishing, Mi said "Mum, when are we going back to Australia?". He as deadly serious, it was so cute, we all cracked up laughing. As we were walking back to the car, it was like 0 degrees and we saw a girl wearing a mini skirt! She didn't even have ugg boots on. Physco. When i finally got into bed, i heard Mi snoring like mad! Great. I turned on my side, and got ready for a loooong night. The next day we all went to the war memorial and Parliment house. May i say: boring. It just went on and on and on and on. And on. Later that night we went to Zefferelli's. I had a really nice Chicken Kiev...Yum... For the next two days we all went to watch Mi and Callum's cycling races. They both went really well. I liked being there. I mean, who wouldn't? We were surrounded by half-naked lycra-shorted hot guys. It was so funny on saturday night; Beth and I were sitting on my bed at 10:30, trying to capture the attention of kids that were there on a camp. Evertime someone would pass the small window next to my bed, we would call out, "Hey kids!" hoping they would hear us and come over. When they did come over we were gonna go "apple..." in a really scary voice. Unfortunately you had to be there.  On Sunday night we had a really nice din dins. We got take out from Ali Baba's (lebanese) and took it bak to our lodge. I had a mini Dona Kebab and chips and a coke. Yum...My fave food. This morning i woke up to the sound of the single TV station, WIN. I climbed out of bed excitedly, knowing it was the last day in the hole. This morning is kind of a blur, (i have a bad short term memory) all i know is i am now home and the insurance company has finally coughed up the rest of the dvd's. Excelllent...  LOluv, CM.

          I am so annoyed with this english curriculum. I am forced to read a book for english, (in my opinion) about human canibalism. It is graphic and gross. Maybe i could get away with not reading it. Ellen didn't read the last english book, and the whole half yearly exam was based on it.

           I am so sick of robots.  Roadkill is evil,  he tried to make me fail my class mark!  I'll kill him . It doesn't help, Ellen joining our group and breaking Roadkill every second day. That just makes Mr Mackay more angry. Ellen go away,  FAR, FAR ,  away ! You too Roadkill, follow the devil,  just go, go out the door, dont turn around now, coz ur not welcome any more, u were the one who tried to make my marks go down, do you think i'd crumble? Do you think i'd lay down and fail? Oh no not I! I will reprogram! I will make you  self destruct  untill there is nothing left!  Well that didn't go with that stupid song but i just want it to hold Ellen's hand and walk off the side of the earth (if that is possible!?). I shall no longer be captain of this  N*E*R*D  squad who is made to make  killer robots . Hannah, wanna swap electives with me? I think you will find this class alot more  fitting . First period this morning, i swear it was humping my shoe like the lil chihuahua in  American Wedding .  It will pay . Meridith made it follow me around-something to do with the colour of my shoes, it is attracted to them.  Aaahhh!  I hope i dont have to see it again 2morro. It gives me the creeps. I hate picking it up! When i want to turn it off (thank heavens that is possible) i have to pick it up by the body (while it's wings and wheels are still moving) and press the button. I dunno, it sounds easy but (*literal chill down my spine*) i just can't, i can't.  Arghh!  I g2g.   Blogging off,  kCMai

          Lunch was so funny today. Hannah told me i was coming to watch Beth and her dance, since i had no choice, i went. When i got there i met up with Jacki, Gem, Anna, Keira and Mel. We all were trying to get to the gallery without Mrs. Jarret seeing so we could watch Han and Beff's dance in the hall. We started our voyage by crawling under the wall (so she couldn't see us) and then resting by a nearby curtin. We then had two choices. 1) We could make a run for it-to the next curtin, or 2) we could get down on our bellies and slide along the ground like in the army trenches. We decided to run for it, coz by that time our Yr 7 and 8 groupies/followers were copying our style, and we didn't wanna look like complete loonies. Just as we got to the next curtain, Mrs. Jarret turned around, to find heaps of yr 8's running. She ordered them all bak to the start (the sports noticeboard). Game Over. Breathing deeply, us clever yr 9s, ran up the stairs and hid behind the chairs. The lower years had started crawling again way back at level 1. We had now made it to level 3 and were watching the dance. They were pretty good, except for the blinding costume. Just then, Mrs. Jarret caght us off guard as she turned around to see us laughing. She sent us way back to where the yr 7's had just set off. A while later, us yr 9s, the yr7s and the yr 8s were all retiring behind the curtin. We were all watching Kelly and Sian's dance (which was great) when some1 yelled "Code 3, Code 3, Code 3 Alert!!" (not really but uno me) . Just then, every single person in the gallery stood up and ran to the stairs at the opposite side. I lukily enough, was alreadi sitting crouched there. I wasn't expecting this big mob of aroung 60 girls to come trampeding over me. Through legs, i spotted Mrs. Jarret walking up the stairs at the front of the hall, coming towards the gallery. "Ahhh!!!" i screamed as i was kicked numerous times, and crawling (more like rolling) down the stairs on all fours, with another 30 yr 8s screaming and running behind me. When i landed "thump" at the bottom (everyone tripping over me. It was kinda like on Jackass where Wee Man had the witches hat thing on him and he stood at the bottom of the escalator. ) i quickly got up and ran with the rest of the students. With one big push, about 10 people (including me) squeezed out the back door frame, with many following. Afraid to look bak, i kept running, untill i saw Jacki a couple of rampaging yr 8s ahead. As i reached her, we stopped running, and she asked "What's happening?", i answered shortly "Jarret." She nodded and we laughed. Apart from being bashed down the stairs and tumbling with yr 8s kicking at my backside (as if i wasnt in enough pain!!) it was funny. Plus-i got rewarded with a savoury on my way bak to the central skool building-the canteen was giving them out 4 free coz it was the end of lunch. Well i am gonna go get ready for the OC, an hour in advanced. Ehxcellent! Im excited...pplz out there...WATCH IT!

          Last night was the  Winter Sleepout . It was soo much fun! After small group we all went to Luke's factory where we spent an absolutely   freezing   night. But it was cool. We even had a real bum show up. Aka. Monty. I was soo tired today! I got 5 hrs sleep-which is a surprise, yet still when i got home, i had a shower, then slept from 10:30-5pm. Beth and Luke stayed up all night talking-until Luke had to go to rowing in the morning. What the hell could they've been talking about for so long at that time? Weird, weird people. N e ways, we think there may be a  relationship developing  between  Anika and Westy  (!?) -or was that just me? Excellent... Yeh so last night, we watched a documentary 'bout bums, ate lots of junk food and watched ultimate chick-flick, Sweet Home Alabama. Everyone was fighting over the couches all night as Luke and Beth shared a couch for the majority of the night and did   SOMETHING   under the blankets. (lol) We're on to you two.. I wish i wore my  uggies  in my sleeping bag-i had frozen toes this morning, it was nearly as bad as camp. I was soo surprised about the turn out. I thought heaps of people from church were coming. Altogether there was probably only like 18 people, then half of them wern't sleeping in the factory or had to go home. Next year, we sooo should go to  Toronga zoo  (not that i dont like ur factory, luke), imagine sleeping next to the gorilla or lion enclosure! Or in the reptile walkway. Or that part where it is like a glass walkway under water, so you wake up in the middle of the night to see a shark above you. Whoa! Mad.Well, i gotta go read other people's blogs.Tata-CM  PS. Did anyone actually get sponsers? I only got 2! I feel bad for having fun last night. Imagine bums out there who have to sleep in the freezing cold everynight-with not even a sleeping bag. That'd suck bigtime. Maybe that is why there are so many bums in California, the warmth.

      Here i am in ICT (computers). How boring! I just had a science test. You could bring ur notes into the exam, but poor gemma forgot. I didnt know whether to give her one of my page of notes or not. I ended up not giving her one coz i really want to go well in science this year coz bith my parents majoured in it. Ahhhh! I feel bad now. What would u do? Sorry gem.  N e ways, Mrs cenzie is late....yes! Everyone is blogging. lol. It was soo weird last night. I was in the shower, and i heard my nanna singing! I was sooo confused coz she lives in melbourne. I started to panic coz i thought i was hallucinating and also my nanna had a dream she saw my aunty die, the next morning she got a call from the police saying that shehad a drug overdose. I was scared the same thing was happening to me! I wrapped a towel aroung myself and went to the door. I looked outside and know one was there. Both my parents and bro were still at squash, i swear i heard her. It had her exact voice, coz i know how she sings off by heart coz she used to sing the song to me. It is all fine though. Pop would've called if sum thing was wrong.  N e way, my friend Jacki had a baby last night! I am soo excited! She had a Caesar but everything else went absolutely fine. Thankyou Lord. Thankyou with blessing her with a baby. Unfortunately i do not yet know what sex it is. I hope she had a girl. Boys are cuter but she would absolutely love dressing a girl up and stuff! Congratulations to Chris and Jacki! Yay!~ I can't stop blabbering on about it! Yes, well Mrs. Mcenzie still isnt here luckily.  Omg! I am sooo excited bout the winter sleepout tonight! It is gonna be sooo much fun being bums! Doing Bummy things...the joy is overwhelming! I am gonna freeze though. But it'll all b cool. Doubt anyone'll get to sleep. Ehxcelllennnt...  Freeze Frame! Random! I thought i saw a ball fly across the window. TaTa 4 now-kc

          Why is it that my parents never tell me what they are doing? My brother too. Most days i come home to find an empty house, and i get no call or anything untill 8 pm! It is sooo annoying! Right now, i have absolutely no idea where anyone is, my bro came home for 10min, and i was calling him, and he wasn't answering, and so i went down stairs to the garage, and lo and behold, the car is missing. Rejected a-gain. I was gonna write a recount of my supposably 'bad' day, coz i got such good responses from my last bad day, but my stupid lack of short term memory is making it dam hard. I cannot remember anything after last sunday. I used my intelligence, by asking Gemma what i did today, but proving that i couldn't remember whether i had a sex change or something, she answered, "..i wasn't there...". Great. So, i suppose you just have to listen to me babble on about nothing.... I think ur soo mean, i think we should try, i think i can need this in my life. I think i'm just scared, I think too much...  Bleeeeeeeeeeeeep. Wait! Something is coming to me! PD class, yes, yes. Future. O god, that's right! I was in PD, being the mature, sophisticated person that i am. I was writing, with the helpful aid of Hannah, a "Most likely to be a .........." list. Jess is gonna be an alcoholic, Annie-a sex slave (she suggested it), Julia- a councellor, Hannah-Mini Mr. Evil, Lauren-Priminister,  Jacki-a person behind a tourist booth, Mel-a bumb, Keira-prestigious author of 'Erotica', Volume 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 and 12. Also author and illistrator of 'Spot'. Also there were other people and various mean tags associated with them. (eg. prostitute at Porkies, married to Johny Douglas Howard etc). Yeah well, we weren't trying to diss our friends or n e thing, we had every intention of showing them the list, but Mrs. Irwin walked up to my desk and snatched the peice of paper out of my clasped hand. "Can i see that?" she said, as she waddled back to her desk. What's with asking the question after you take the paper, she didnt let me answer! N e way, Hannah and I cracked up, as i realised she is gonna think im for real. She would probably send me and my porno group to the councellor, that is if she can read my droolish writing (unlikely). N eway, Hannah couldn't risk it, so at the end of the period, she snatched it off her desk and ran out of the classroom. Mrs. Irwin just tuned around to see hannah, jogging out of the rooom complete with the confiscated paper. She was just about to say sum thing to me as i jumped out after hannah, and ran off. Hannah and I laughed it off, while walking to the canteen. On the way back, we were walking up the steps towards the library, when we saw Mrs. Irwin standing at the top of the stairs. We silently screamed and sprinted into the rarely seen [by us] library. We retreited there for a while, untill we thought it safe to come out. As we slowly walked into the Yr 9 locker room, we saw Mrs. Irwin talking to some poor kid. We laughed as we snuck past. At that moment she happened to look up and saw hannah and i. Hannah ran away. I thought it was too late, and was about to surrender with Hannah, but i looked at my side, and saw hannah sprinting to the door. I told my self 'what the hell' and ran after her, to leave a fuming Mrs. Irwin with her latest victim. When we got back to the group, we shared the list around and all laughed. Friends r great.

          Tonight i had no homework coz i managed to get out of it at skool. Excellent. Yeh so, tonight i sat down and watched the whole feature commentry on American Pie 3. It was sooo funny. They were talking bout how they had to train the dogs to hump Jim's leg, so they had to get this little chihuahua to practice on a plastic toy. Also, they were talking bout the stripper scene, where the guy that was tied up in the closet had to sit tied up there all day, for like 12hrs. Just sitting there, waiting for his que. Oh...there was soo many things that were funnier that they were talking about, but unfortunately, i can't remember them. Bummer. The other day, i watched the Honey Commentary. I found out that Romeo (is that his name?) , in the second half of filming, had to put his feet apart, so he appeared shorter, coz, he suddenly got a growth spurt while they were still filming the movie, and they didn't want him to look taller than honey. And Raymond, the lil guy, you know how he was missing his 2 front teeth? Yeh, well, half way through filming honey, his two teeth came out, and so they had to blacken them out everytime he smiled. Neways....i shall go watch another commentary. Barnicle Barnabus and Mum were watching the funniest reality TV series before, it was of this family from detroit, that were put on a reality TV show, where they got sent to Peru, where they had to adjust to life with this traditional family. It was a mum, a dad, and 3 boys. I went in there a minute a go, and it was 'bath time', and so the host family brought out this big tin full of murky yellow water, that they sed was their 'shampoo'. fter they all stuck their heads in the buckets, to clean their hair, the host family explained the ingredients. It ended up being the host families supply of urine! It was soo gross! The 15 yr oldd son looked soo pale, coz he is like full hygenic, and he was like ewwwwwwww!!Ahhhh!. N e ways, i g2g, LOluv, kc

          Willow : Ok, say that I help, and you start a conversation. It goes great. You like buffy, she likes you. You spend time together, feelings grow deeper, and one day, without even realizing it, you find you're in love. Time stops, And it feels like the whole world's made for you two, and you two alone, until the day one of you leaves and rips the still-beating heart from the other, who's now a broken, hollow, mockery of the human condition. hehe, just a random line in Buffy Season 4. (she had just broken up with Oz and Riley wanted help asking Buffy out. I hate Riley, and the stupid whole initiative!)

          School was fun today....I know that sounds Oh so nerdish, but it was. It started with Mel, Beth and I walking into the school without our precious blazers, and Mrs. Cranny going ballistic. I believe the last words were a threat. Brilliant. Yeh so when i walked into our locker room the 'We love the OC' vs. the 'We hate the OC' war began. We all fought for a while before slowly resigning to seperate sides of the locker room. After a while Ellen, showed up, revealing that she had watched the OC! Yay! She was soon transported to our side of the locker room. I filled Ellen in on the buffy and Angel news to ellen while she was away. I went on for a while blabbering on about James Masters on Rove, while she interrogated me 'bout what he looked like. Neway, first period finally started, which was science, i raced through my work with gemma, then rested the rest of the lesson as the rest of our dumb, slow class, finished. It is always a plus being in a dumb class. In second period, i was disappointed to find out we would not get our maths test back today. Instead, i tested my dork skills by volunteering to read my 'perfect' answers in front of the class. Ah...prissy casey. We then had recess. I was soo hungry. I gobbled up my food, still getting curious glares from my friends as to what is deppressing me. Quit it. Third period was Civics History. Joy. I started to stress as the teacher told us her new plans to be mean with homework, coz i couldnt find mine. Just as she was coming to check our homework, Morto pulled my homework out and gave it to me. "Thanks" she said. She had taken it to copy last night. I sighed with relief, knowing i allready had 3 red crosses (Ooo) and one more would result in a phone call to my parents. I dont suppose they would care. I remember in Yr 6, dad got a phone call from my teacher, saying that "Mr. Hinde, this is a serious issue, this would be the second time Casey has lit fire to the demountable!", and dad forgot to tell mum. Only joking ( i only lit fire to the school once ) but i remember my year 4 teacher calling up and telling dad that i had been the winner of this prestigious award, and that i was supposed to be at a certain place and at a certain time, wearing a certain thing, and dad forgot about the whole thing. So i had to be given the award at school. Neway, what was i talking about? Oh right! CC History. While the class read the sheets Ms. Mcbeth gave us, i (being oh so smart) started doing the questions, knowing that they would almost definately be set for homework. By the time the class finished reading, i had managed to finish the work and drift off. Excellent. I akoke suddenly as Morto gave me a painfull poke in the gut. Honestly, that girl does not know her own strength, lol. 4th period was Commerce, i just sat there playing with hannah's ruler, as Mrs. Black gave me several evil glances, each lasting for minutes. At lunch, we were all designated original spice girl names and also we played the bin game. You heard me. My idea. I took our bin over to the year 7's bin and emptied out the rubbish as the yr 7's watched in awe. Then i took it back to my group. By this time, the whole playground was watching. They must've been dam bored. N e way, i sat down, and kicked the bin as hard as i could. It landed in an angry jess's lap. She then kicked it back, i kicked it sideways, landing on gem, gem chucked it on the ground screaming, then we all did one big kick at the same time, so the bin flew up in the air, andlanded back on the fuming Jess. "I'm sorry" i said in mockery. Because of the hight the bin had reached, it had captured the attention of CB, as he strutted over in his stomach high pants and evil glare. At that, Lauren had straightened up pretendng to be mature for lover boy. He told us to stop playing with the bin. By that time i had crept off towards the locker room so my friends would have the invisable Casey to blame. All part of my devious plan...5th period was Art. It was prac. thankfully. I finished off my art work, which was a tree sculpture bcoz they wanted us to say sorry to the trees (lol!?) and made a cast for my finger. I went to the other art room where i stood alone, drying my cast under the hand dryer. It wasn't long until i heard the pounds on the window from the year seven's who were trying to come in. I laughed at them. I stayed there a bit longer drying the cast, then deliberately walked up to the door, pretended to fiddle with the lock, then stood back a foot, and watch them all dive to the door trying to open it. When they finally realised i hdnt unlocked it, they looked up to see me laughing maliciously and walking away. How i do like to taunt the wee young ones. They deserve it. Most of them think they are god's ONLY gift to the world. Last period was english. I don't remember what happened coz i fell asleep within 2 minutes of the lesson. Alison Doube screamed out "Casey!" at the top of her lungs as everyone else put their chairs on the desk. With a jerk, i suddnely shot up, hitting my head on her chair. That was my day, then i went home. lol. I suppose in hindsight, that wasn't a good day, but that is about as good as my days get unfortunately. Luv cm
