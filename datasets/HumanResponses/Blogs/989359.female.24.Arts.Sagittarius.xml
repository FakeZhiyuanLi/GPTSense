      I guess I was sort of trying to ignore it, but the fact that I still don't have a job (and my mother's forceful words) encouraged me to go to the unemployment office today. Thanks to  urlLink Susan  for accompanying me. So, it's official I guess. I'm unemployed. Yeah, I'm actually considering taking Brett up on his offer for a job at Blockbuster...if it's still good.  Shit. I think I need to move out of the suburbs.

      Go see it now kids.  I've been a fan of Michael Moore from his meager beginnings. And if you haven't already, you should check out  urlLink his web site  along with his previous films and books.  I think I've stated before that I idolize the man. Someday I hope I'm doing documentaries that make a difference and piss off the president to boot.

      So, according to " urlLink The Political Compass ", I'm Economic Left/Right: -6.88 and Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: -6.72. That little red dot there, that's me.  Extreme Liberal Leftist, who knew?  Apparently I'm more left and more Libertarian than  urlLink Ghandi . There is a lot of information, including a reading list, on this page if you're interested and here's a  urlLink link  to it.

      I'm counting the days until I get to sit at the start line.  I'm pretty sure I should have heard the gunshot by now. Too bad debt creeps in without a sound and pins me for life.  Back to school? Someday.  Right now, I'm trying to forget through frequent use of sedatives. Take one valium down, pass the bottle around. 98 bottles of pills on the wall. I unwind the clock just to pass the time more slowly. And the sun doesn't dissapear as fast when you drive towards it at 85 miles per hour. If I could, I would chase the  urlLink sun  forever.

          You're  Cat's Cradle !   by Kurt Vonnegut   You believe quite firmly that free will deserted you long ago and far away. As a result, it's hard to take responsibility for anything. Even though you show great potential as a leader of a small 3rd world country, the choices are all made ahead of time. You're rather fond of games involving string. Your fear of nuclear weaponry is trumped only by your fear of ice. Take the  urlLink book quiz  if you dare.

       urlLink You  ever have those days where dancing the Charleston makes you invent things?   I bet you don't. I'm just not seeing it happen. That would never happen to the likes of you. Me or possibly  urlLink Susan ?  Yes.  I must informally inform you that sometimes. Things go wrong. They go way wrong, and then you realize. That you have no idea what wrong is.  It's like the wrong. Is gone. And you. Are gone. Way wrong. BOY!

        "Let that be a lesson to you sweetie. Never love anyone." You hate people. A lot. You probably once loved someone, but something went wrong. Because of that, you now despise pretty much anyone and everyone. But while there are a ton of worthless assholes in the world, not everyone is one. There are people out there who do care.     urlLink   Which Advice Quote said by Homer Simpson are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      So, Moore's found a distributor.  Not so much as found, but his friends at Mirimax, the Weinstein bros., formed their own company to release the film.  What the hell?   If only it were that easy for a lone film graduate from SIUC. All I've been thinking about lately is the fact that I don't even have a camera or any equipment at all to be able to continue any of this creativity leaking out of my ears and nose directly from me brains. So, if any of you out there want to invest in a pretty damn good filmmaker, SEND MONEY NOW. Maybe someday Moore and Mirimax and the Weinstein bros. will be helping me to get distribution for my controversial documentary. A girl can dream.

      I feel like I walk a thin line living at my house. It's a line shaped like a figure eight and I'm destined to walk it forever. I'm tired of fighting, tired of "respecting", tired of living here. It's ridiculous, the words that are exchanged in this house. Does it really matter when a 24 year old comes home at night? I'm not 15, nor do I think I should follow rules obviously intended for a 15 year old. Goddamn, I have to get out of here.

      Yeah, I'm a huge fan of the original Star Wars Trilogy. And, hey...The newest franchise George Lucas is working on happens to be associated with some of my favorite films of all time.&nbsp; And just so everyone knows, yes, I am excited (sort of) about Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith (the official title announced this past weekend at the comic-con in San Diego...another good reason to move there) and it's scheduled for release on May 19, 2005. It may be a shitfest of crappy dialogue and computer generated effects, but I'm still going to go see it...even if George Lucas will never be allowed in my house again.

      If any of you out there were wondering what the hell to get me for my birthday (I know it's still 5 months away, but I thought I'd give you a head start)...you should go to  urlLink this place  and buy me some. Fast. Just pick one with a purty bottle so that I can keep it on my shelf after I drink it all. Don't forget the spoons and glasses too! Thanks guys.

      I found myself enjoying a documentary tonight. Not that this is odd...considering the fact that I love documentaries. This one was centered around one man's roadtrip across country. The  urlLink first roadtrip , infact.  It got me thinking about last summer, when I took a roadtrip with  urlLink Susan  and this other  urlLink cat . I miss the open road.  Or, how about getting flooded out in New Orleans, camping in the middle of the desert in New Mexico, peeing over the side of the Grand Canyon, or seeing the Pacific...I miss it all.  And, damn I'd like to do it again.  Anything other than sitting here, typing this.  Hell, I'd settle for driving to Susan's house...which is what I'm about to do.   Anyway. This documentary was mighty good. It was done by Ken Burns and Tom Hanks was the voice of Horatio. I recommend it, and if you haven't already noticed the other two links,  urlLink here's  another one.  And if you can, I also recommend you get out of the house, stop reading this...go west young man...go west!

      There's nothing like getting woken up before you intended to by a friend that's 3000 miles away and actually has a job.  And then having them tell you to go back to sleep and waking up three hours later.  Yeah, I slept till 1 in the afternoon today. I don't intend on doing much of anything to counteract that point either. I'm a lazy human. and  urlLink this  is freakin' great!

      I'm a fan of both Kubrick and (early)Spielberg, more so of Kubrick though.  And when I saw this quote on  urlLink this page , I laughed. And I enjoyed it, because it's true. I thought I should share.  “When I see a film by Kubrick, I see Oz the Great and Powerful. When I see a film by Spielberg, I see a man behind a curtain pulling levers and barking into a microphone.”  —Jerry Boyajian (jayembee)

      A record store. The only place on earth that retail might just be OK, hopefully.  Screw you Barnes and Noble. I knew books, I loved books, but music is much higher on my list.  Number 2 to be exact.  My list of top five all time places to work (made at age 16) 1. Movie Theatre. (new movies, free movies...film = cool) 2. A record store. (Access to music, etc. very important) 3. Book Store. (new books, cheap books, magazines, etc.) 4. Movie Rental place. (new movies, free rentals) 5. Art supply store. (cheap painting supplies, etc.)  If I worked at  urlLink Championship Vinyl , Rob would say the same thing about me... "I can't fire them. I hired these guys for three days a week and they just started showing up every day. That was four years ago." So, I'm destined to sell bad music while wearing cosby sweaters and listening to sad bastard music.  And I'm OK with that.  For now.

      Apparently Lucas is going to show us the wookiee planet in episode three. It's called Kashyyyk. Three y's. Who knows? Anyway. Already dealt with in the expanded universe, I'm excited about the possibility of wookiee everything on the big screen... the city, the weapons, the vehicles. Who wouldn't want to know what a wookiee domicile looks like? You can read more about Kashyyyk  urlLink here.   But, only if you're a giant nerd, like me.

      It's raining right now. I think it's pretty fitting. I like rain. I like the smell of the earth after it rains. I like feeling the rain on my skin. I'd like to be washed away by the rain, like a scattering of ashes. Powdery, gooey and then just watery dirt running down the drain in the street.

      Susan and I went to the "good land" last night to see my favorite band,  urlLink Modest Mouse .  Wisconsin smells funny, but it was worth it.  Speaking of smelling funny, it was unbelievably steamy at this venue.  I still had a fucking blast though.  Goddamn, there's nothing better than live music...especially live Modest Mouse.
