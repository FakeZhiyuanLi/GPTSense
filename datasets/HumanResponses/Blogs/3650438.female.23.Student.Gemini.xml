      Right about now you probably thinking I'm a huge Eminem fan.  Odly enough I didn't even list him under my favorite music.  Hmmm.  Very interesting.  Well today is June 17th, notoriously the day that OJ Simpson took off on a low speed car chase.  This year, the day Martha Stewart is sentenced.  It's also my birthday, but the truth is, I don't have much to write about since my birthday was, thus far, pretty uneventful.  Which is fine, at 23 you just don't need all the hoopla accompanying previous birthdays.    I was thinking back, trying to decide what was my favorite birthday.  It's pretty hard, I don't really remember a lot of them, but I guess my favorite one was when I turned 18.  I've spent a lot of time recently reflecting on that time in my life, I just attended my brother and cousin's graduations, and I did get a feel again of that essence I felt at that momment of my life.  In a word, carefree probably describes it best.  It really was great to enjoy that graduation without the impeding burden of repaying student loans.

      So a few weeks ago, I had never heard of a weblog, and now I have my own.  Crazy eh?  I'm a weblog virgin, so go easy... :) Well Ian and I decided that we have the coolest names in the weblog universe, which I have to say is true.  So let me explain the origin of my blog name.  About five years ago, I had a roommate named Quinn.  We worked together and a friend from work began calling us Quinn Shady and Slim Katie (this was around the time that Eminem's second album came out, and it was all over the radio). Hence, the kick-ass name.

      So Ian put this picture of me on the blog, which I must confess, is not my favorite picture of me.  However, I will leave it up there for the time being, since he seems to like it so well.  Mostly I hate the glasses, they're Ian's, and I've made fun of them  since the day we met, but this my best attempt at a Top Gun impression, and I'll admit it does have a secret service quality to it.  And besides, Top Gun ... the volleyball scene, need I say more?    So as you might have noticed, I've kept the Eminem theme alive, although it did necessitate finding my Eminem CDs,  but I'm kind of a theme person, so I have to run with it... and as often as I write in the blog, he'll probably have another album out before I run out of titles.  (just hope he doesn't sue me)
