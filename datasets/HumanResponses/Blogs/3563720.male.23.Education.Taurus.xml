      Seasons do change. This doesn't happen in California. It's quite strange. Life remains vivid in the death of summer. Some toss around baseballs and footballs while others lounge on the grass. A lovely scene.  Couples cutely walk through the autumnal bliss. Even Ezra and Andrew seem happy today. Their statuesque figures are warm and free from nature's torment, minus periodic spiteful birds. Life's curveballs lose their movement for brief moments.  Anxiety aggraves unpleasant pathologies within my digestive system. I feel evil forces again. They're latent instead of overt. The conspirators can't come here to get me because they're already here.  I try to move my mind back to the place of youthful innocence. Angry joggers take me away from it periodically on my walks. The pleasantness of this situation is a very tenuous equilibrium.

      You appear through the mundane - a world of lines, libraries, and airplanes You leave me with no choice but to stare at your seductive green eyes and dark curly hair. You adorn yourself with mall-purchased clothing; olive pants and a white tank-top, from Abercrombie. I need to meet you and converse on a walk but have not the courage to you to talk You must adore film and The Doors and want to live in a California home with a jacuzzi and hardwood floors...  However anxiety convinces me to let you remain a mystery

      Freedom's shore approaches in the middle of the night. It is springtime and the sun signifies the youthful vibrancy of coupling and spiritual fulfillment. I presently feel oblivious to these elements. The experience of waiting continually intensifies. Anticipatory, nervous chills race through my spine.  Rest is impossible on this solo journey. Thoughts of how love has failed me twice before render this state. Loneliness disturbs me for the first time in months. My mind races through thousands of slightly differentiated paths that are all mental aliases for my companionship needs.  Waiting for the sun to come along. Waiting. Waiting.  Daylight and chances to be happy taunt me through their absence. All will be well once this night is over.  The destroys the night as the sun slowly rises. My seratonin levels increase and provide a settling chemical rush.  I ask the sun what went wrong. Why did it not come sooner? It does not reply. It simply emanates more heat. The light energy then burns a message into the sand: learn to forget.  Learn to forget?  A crystal ship appears on the shore, apparently to take me away. The captain screams "1000 thrills! 1000 girls!" I jump aboard to be greeted by Jenna Jameson and a bottle of Cristal. Forgetting suddenly becomes much easier...

      Everyone is starting to look alike; not quite identical; similar akin to different brands of bike  My peers are such repetitive sights with the same clothes and the same hairstyles and the same tastes...  They all share the same plight: too much time and money  coupled with no need to fight  These people do not think about survival -  let alone ethics, morality, mankind or even whether everything seems uniform  Alas, I am guilty as well I sport a generic haircut Overpriced designer jeans and grew up in a comfortable home in an upscale suburban hellhole  And I wonder why our elders see us as herds

      Her eyes stare blankly at words on a page as she blindly moves her highlighter with rage  Tawdry gold-hoop earrings complement  her dirty brown hair and clear complexion  The males around her have no choice but to stare, not at the book, but at her lavender-accentuated look

      The medical man on a meter analyzes the mental bleeder  The patient discusses how she adores pornography, but not nearly as much as she loves amphetamines  The doctor glances at his Rolex watch as his monitor displays the client's crotch  She finds it odd that he stares at the screen on his desk but, compared to other shrinks, feels no need to protest  When the session is over she receives a hefty bill for services rendered and he uploads some footage that might not even offend her  Alas, she ignores the bill because it came with a prescription -  the one that will temporarily fulfill her Dexedrine addiction

      I found my work from my first creative writing course during my sophomore year of college. Its content accurately represents some of what was inside my head during that period of my life. In retrospect, I have mixed feelings about the quality of these pieces. They have many nuances that I now perceive as flaws. Yet, they were really fun for me to write, as well as therapeutic, back then. I hope that the readers of these short compositions gain something from their bizarre content.

      Even though the game clock is not expired, it's safe to say that the Detroit Pistons are going to win the NBA Finals. Two minutes left, 98-79 in favor of Detroit.   Four future hall-of-famers failed to meet expectations (especially Gary Payton).   The Pistons simply played as a better team unit.   May the Lakers revamp as a franchise and EARN an NBA Championship within the next few years. Management must find quality talent that is willing to play hard consistently. The end of their dynasty has come (some argue that it ended last year against the Spurs in the Western Conference Semifinals).   At least my Dodgers (a regular source of disappointment), are up 4-0 and still in first place in the NL West (albeit by percentage points).

      This year's NBA Finals is painful to watch at this point. Unless the Lakers become the first team in league history to come back from a 3-1 deficit, a team from one of the most miserable, decayed cities in the nation will gain championship rings.   Another sad note for Los Angeles sports fans: Dodgers lost 4-1 today. Another bad outing for Hideo Nomo. He didn't make it through the fourth inning.

      So, I've been up all night because my tempermental computer somehow corrupted my buddy's essay just before I could e-mail it to him - so I revised it twice (YUCK!). At least he'll get a higher grade on it than he would have otherwise received. Considering how bad I used to be about doing my own homework, it's ironic that the majority of my income is derived from doing the homework of others in one way or another.   I'm continually hearing some sort of vibrating noise tonight. I keep thinking that it's my cell phone, but it's not (I've checked it multiple times already). I think it's coming from above. My new landlord is in the process of moving into the other side of the duplex. I'm definitely not the biggest fan of hers right now. Not getting into it. I just hope that it's a cell phone and not her battery-operated significant other that I'm hearing. If I keep hearing it, I'll totally have to move. I can't picture that broad with a real boyfriend. She's in her late 20s, really unattractive, teaches pre-school, and lives with her three cats. Why did she have to buy the place and kick out my chill, attractive neighbors so that she could move in?   I don't think she could piss me off to the point where I'd rather live with my parents in Studio City, but one never knows.   Gooodnight.  P.S. Why, oh why, did the Nets blow the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Pistons? GO LAKERS! P.P.S. Dodgers finally won today. Kaz Ishii is 8-3 with a 3.36 ERA right now, yet he has looked so much worse than those numbers seem. I hope DePodesta trades him while he's still overvalued.

      If not for Kobe Bryant's ability to work miracles, the Lakers would be absolutely screwed in the NBA Finals at this point. Detroit had a 6-point lead with under a minute left of regulation and the Lakers, between Shaq and Kobe, somehow tied the game to send it to overtime.   Fortunately, they manhandled the Pistons in OT, but they could easily be down 2-0. Given tonight's divine intervention, I still have faith in them to win this series, but the Pistons do technically have home-court advantage for the rest of it. It would thoroughly suck if the Eastern Conference won the Finals for the first time since the Chicago Bulls dynasty at the expense of Los Angeles.   As Angelenos, we tolerate our Dodgers' ineptitude, live without an NFL team, and deal with the Clippers being perpetual losers. For the second largest media market in the country, we deserve one perennial champion. May the Lakers continue to serve that purpose.

      Is it too much for you to handle feelings true?  Bottled animosity uncontrollable urges feeble codependency hidden in purses  Conflicts unsettled  with no clear answers nevermore meddle as our paths diverge  You were my consiglieri during my most trying moments in a world of fantasy.  Now a continent apart  with rifts irreparable I have nothing in my heart for you that is sharable  We said our goodbyes  with such angry looks from our bloodshot eyes  There will be no amends no longer are we friends  Daily reminders still exist that both of us easily list  Some future time we may talk again and no longer care of was and when.

      As I work with more mathematics students as part of my tutoring job, I realize that I enjoy quantitative studies better than the liberal arts in many ways. Even topics I used to dread - such as Riemann sums, geometry, trigonometry, conic sections, and polar coordinates - now fascinate me. I enjoy solving such problems at this point. Not that I find the humanities boring and useless (so far from the truth), but simply that I wish I had a broader canon of knowledge (one can never know too much).    Now I want to relearn multivariable calculus and finally attain a strong grasp on series representations of functions. I think that I'm going to study linear algebra at either a Cal State or community college in the fall so, if nothing else, I can tutor students in more advanced courses. I should also take some accounting courses in case I decide to pursue taxation or other numbers-oriented areas of corporate law.   I took a slew of classes at Cornell and can think of several more years worth of undergraduate - let alone graduate - courses that I still want to take. Unfortunately, no graduate programs can accomodate all of my educational desires (as there is no single, or clear interdisciplinary, area of study in which I wish to attain a Ph.D).   In spite of the need for gainful employment, I want to be some sort of student forever (at least whatever future career I choose will have a continuing education program).   Being a teacher sucked as a job for me because I did not learn anything new that I found of value - I did not grow as a person from teaching English and science to unappreciative children with severe discipline problems. I became resentful because my students were really obnoxious and had attitudes that were incompatible with mine. One more line on a resume if nothing else, although I still have issues with my former employer (not getting into it until they are fully resolved).  Tutoring is a better fit for me because I work with individuals instead of groups, make good money for my time, have a positive relationship with my employer, and feel as if I have accomplished something by the end of the day. Unlike in a classroom where discipline takes precedence over education, most of my students genuinely want to learn. They come to me because they have difficulty learning certain topics and I help them with the process. Truthfully, I like this work so much that I'd even do it as a volunteer.    I continue to be outside of school as I figure out what to study next, so I'm wasting time that I could use for accredited education. I do learn a tremendous amount in the many hours of time I spend at home - I read several newspapers and magazines online, finished a couple of books recently, work on GMAT practice tests, and perceive my television viewing and mindless web browsing as writing research.   Enough empty analysis for now. Will continue later.

      Aside from that uber-bizarre episode with Tony's layered dreams, this entire season was most excellent. The FBI's active involvement contributes ample suspense to the chaotic lives of the families within the show. Since next season is the show's final one, it saddens me to think that Tony Soprano will either end up dead or in jail by the end of next season. He tries to act justly in a criminal underworld and abide by its rule of law. Yet, he is in embattled in a living nightmare with no clear escape route. I would love for Tony to avoid both stateside arrest and international extradition and live a wonderful life, but realize the writers will probably choose a different outcome. The show has strong moral overtones and will likely reconcile its closing content with a traditional value/criminal justice system.

      Even though I am a Laker fan, the team really pisses me off in a lot of ways.  -Four future Hall-of-Famers, half of whom perpetually underachieve (Shaq and Payton). -Kobe's legal problems (he most likely won't go to jail, but could play somewhere else next season). -A fairly weak bench (compare their reserves to those of the Spurs, Kings, Mavs, Wolves). -Lots of attitude problems. -Team might enter rebuilding phase after this season (unknowns for off-season personnel decisions).  They were downright lazy until Game 3 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the Spurs and would not even be in the NBA Finals if not for divine intervention (the Derek Fisher buzzer-beater). In their defense, they have won 8 of their last 10 playoff games against tough opponents.  Now they have home-court advantage against the Detroit Pistons and will find some way to win the series, barring injuries or an extended period of ineptitude. Four rings in five years. Very nice!  Moreover, the Laker franchise (both Minneapolis and Los Angeles) has appeared in 48% of all NBA Finals and has won more championships than every other team in the league, minus the Boston Celtics. They are more dominant than the New York Yankees are in baseball.  Bottom line:  Relish Championship the Fourth under Phil Jackson. The future of the team will be desirable sooner or later.  Addendum: How did they lose game one so handily at Staples Center? They better up their intensity for the rest of the series or else I'm going to Vegas to bet against them in this series - since they're the favorites, I'd stand to make a nice chunk of change (an ever-decreasing chunk, however, as the Pistons win more games).

      I recently saw an Aladdin Bail Bonds commercial on television. No entertainment value. A bunch of clean-cut people blabbing about how they were arrested. No catchy song, no friendly corporate image.  Bad Boys Bail Bonds, on the other hand, has the most hilarious radio commericals ever (especially on Power 106/100.3 The Beat). The commercial definitely has racial overtones, but it is still effective at reaching its target demographic group in Los Angeles County (you can figure it out).  "I'm gonna call my bail guy tonight...and get released...and go to the house...1-800-BAIL-GUY tonight..." I shouldn't joke about such matters. It is bad karma.  Plus, I already know a bail bondsman.

      Can a person still be a vegetarian/vegan if he or she swallows certain bodily fluids during oral sex with a male?  My answer:  Yes; otherwise, it would be impossible for a vegetarian/vegan to kiss another individual or to reproduce. Even though human fluids seem as though they are animal products, they are clearly pareve (neutral). Animal products such as fish and eggs are also pareve (making oral sex permissible for vegetarians - since eggs are gametes).  In order to justify the act for vegans, however, a lesser scrutiny standard must be used. Since no killing occurs to produce consumable gametes, they should be treated like plants (a readily replenishable source of cells). Although this same argument can conceivably be used to justify the consumption of eggs and dairy products by vegans, that sort of logic seems flawed. If one consumes eggs and dairy products, he simply prevents the perpetuation of life. This concept should most certainly not bother vegans who are pro-choice and/or use birth control. The destruction of gametes (even potentially viable ones) has already been accounted for as morally acceptable to such individuals and, thus, should be permissible.  However, if the vegan happens to be religiously observant (in any of the major religions), this ruling is null and void. It is highly unlikely that this specific vegan falls under this category since the question establishes her moral standing in the community and deserves privacy protections.  And, no, I did not try to talk a vegan into giving me head, so don't ask.

      One fine day  all the thoughts inside my head will turn away from dread I will want to get out of bed  My life would finally blossom if I saw my microcosm as awesome I would no longer be annoyed while lost in my emotional void  My head would be sober and my pain would be over I would stop fooling myself and care more about my health  I would reverse my polarity and would feel truly free  No more away messages sappy with rhymes so childishly crappy

      My core realization for my period of blog inactivity is that I must continue to be a vocal advocate of personal liberty (as brilliantly articulated by Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and others).     If these sages' ideas are lost to the sands of time and freedom becomes equated with modern progressivism/collectivism, then society will be damaged in myriad more ways. We owe it to ourselves to protect our individual liberties and retain faith in the inner good of humanity. Were we to reach a point where society were "fixed" through compulsory means, I doubt that most of us would be happy with such an outcome.     The tyranny of a popular majority is not inherently better than the tyranny of dictatorship. In fact, a benevolent dictator would likely be preferable to the deconstruction of the rule of law via democracy.
