         It seems that the world operates, not in mysterious ways, but in deliberate mischievous plans of action, forever toying with the reality we all hold dear.   Which brings me to my first post. As we contemplate our own lives, we fail to recognize all, that our actions are sure to influence.  Is human ignorance bound by design?  Has it spilt into life's genetic pool?  Or do all manners of life velleit themselves as entities with a purpose?      I imagine myself quite capable of seeing things the way they are.  Funny then, that I manage to confuse purpose, with desire, (you laugh as you finish, every last kernel of corn in your gluttonous meal).      I strive to shed light onto subjects thought to be...Taboo, if you will.  If you follow my posts, you may find subject matter that is, disturbing, harrowing, and so forth.  Please keep in mind that these opinions are my own.  And I'm always open to discussion.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Well another day rolls in and out with the grace of a freight train.  &nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't get to sleep until almost four-thirty, a friend of mine kept me awake in the best way, when everything in my life was falling apart (again)not only was I cheered up, but I went to bed with a smile.  &nbsp;&nbsp; So I'm at work doing nothing fun....But at least I'm getting paid to write blogs.  &nbsp;&nbsp; Well apparently I'll have to go to PotPit to visit to keep my place in line, Don't ask.   So this morning minding my own business, checking some articles in my msn group.&nbsp; I come across a statement that had me peturbed.  &nbsp;&nbsp; Someone saying;&nbsp; any one who's had past life regression about Vampires in mentally ill because they have never existed, they were solely the result of Noble family inbreeding causing delusions.&nbsp; Well, seeing that that little statement in itself is false, let me re-iterate the way things are.  &nbsp;&nbsp; As with all things in life evolution is a force, whether it be quicker in some forms than in others, or just in a constant state of flux, is for you to decide.&nbsp; However, back to the point, Vampires as they exist today no longer drink blood (nor did they ever) ie. "sucking the blood of the earth"  the ability to "borrow" energy from ones host, has long since been grounds for execution.(here you can easily imagine how rumors would form).  &nbsp;&nbsp; Especially interesting considering Pope Gregory IX created the inquisition in 1233 to curb heresy, but the Church officials soon began to count on civil authorities to fine, imprison, torture and kill heretics. It reached peak in 16th century to&nbsp;counter the Reformation.  &nbsp; Needless to say, all Vampires, Witches, and so on tend to remain in the "broom closet" if you will, not that they don't, or laughably  never  existed.  &nbsp;  ~Blessed Be  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;

      As he waits for deaths last kiss.  The time seems to slow. Are there great things he'll miss.  Only time will know.  Choking back breaths of air. Staring at the moon. Always knowing life's not fair. Pursed for certain doom.  Morning breaks and all is well.  His thoughts were just a dream. emerging form his bright blue shell. His eyes bright with gleam.  looking now at things he loves.  He knows life's far from over. luck he says is a bright white dove. Holding a four leafed clover.

         Everyone's been there, at a cross road if you will.  Well it seems I'm here once again, and as familiar as this crossing looks...I am utterly lost. I'm not here to deal with the Devil, or take a high, or a low road.  All I'm here to do is enjoy what time I have, and bring the same joy to others.    Now why is it that this feeling brings guilt to me?  Is it simply insecurity in my own future actions?  Whether they'll lead to success of other wise.  I'm quite sure everyone is aware of there actions as we speak, the choices we made just minutes ago, or even the ones we make minutes from now.  But what about the ones that are unforeseen?  How do we deal with these?  Is that where "character" stems?  Well I'd like to hope I have a pretty good character...Maybe it will help pull me through this life.

      When someone you care about's joy brings you so much pain, are you obligated to be supportive?     It would seem so... Inside, having been crushed enough, my heart wells up and I can feel it's tears.      I'm accustomed to dealing with pain of this nature, and still am so vulnerable. Being forced to move on, I'm glad I met a friend.    Tears well up and my heart breaks. The hurt is more than I can take.  Out I go, with feelings mixed. Not capable of getting fixed.  The bliss I had is quickly over. The time I need is to recover.  Peacful foul will be my healing. Crushed by weight that is feeling.  No tears will fall as time stands still. my empty heart just needs a fill.

          Well, it seems to me that the most beautiful things in this life are met in everyday circumstances.  And as usuall, it's up to you to recognize them.      Luckily, I have a knack for recognizing beauty.  Not saying that I'm at all good at meeting it though.      Furthermore, knowing your number two is sometimes the best there is, (think Silver medal) I'd rather be on the podium than in the stands, if you know what I mean.     So I guess it's time to sit back... And let the cards be dealt.

      Although, the hunt can be, and usually is the most exciting part of meeting new people. Have you ever come to an agreement within? An agreement in which you decide to no longer pursue? Now I'm not talking about giving up, far from it......      More of a tactical change.  Never one to play "hard to get" It seems that my options are very limited, never before have I felt so helpless, and never again will I feel this way.  Now it seems that my efforts are all for not. So through great regret I choose to reside outside of this country, this time may the good Lady, bring me the means to deal with my own problems, and the dicipline to execute them.     So without further adoo... Here are todays thoughts in poetic form.    Clawing desperately at lifes small hand. No questions now, and nothing later.  The smile I see is plastic fear. No questions now, and nothing later.  I work to push out feelings of lust. No questions now, and nothing later.  Escape is how you brave the danger. no questions now, and nothing later.  No questions now. Her Grasp only fleeting. Longing only for reaction. Lusting only further. New danger only waiting. And nothing Later.
