      I went out to the hazel wood,  Because a fire was in my head, And cut and peeled a hazel wand,  And hooked a berry to a thread; And when white moths were on the wing,  And moth-like stars were flickering out, I dropped the berry in a stream  And caught a little silver trout.     When I had laid it on the floor  I turned to blow the fire aflame, But something rustled on the floor,  And some one called me by my name: It had become a glimmering girl  With apple blossom in her hair Who called me by my name and ran  And faded through the brightening air.  Though I am old with wandering  Through hollow lands and hilly lands, I will find out where she has gone,  And kiss her lips and take her hands; And walk among long dappled grass,  And pluck till time and times are done  The silver apples of the moon,  The golden apples of the sun.        wb yeats

      hand in hand stretching nuzzled we nearly fell down and would have rolled into a heap  laughing hand in hand stetching lips some new delicacy and the sound of blood in your ears like a sudden storm  hand in hand storming brain cells haywire soft vision focus hands shaky ballet  hours later I caught a whiff of you  on my shirt like before

      UP2004  style in regress  i sit just me  is it just me  is something missing  always is ... went off  fresh dope dope  colourscheme:constructicon pink force field character  i felt a bit like i did once 5-6 years ago when as a university bound youth i passed by my old elementary school's playground fence, and it seemed so small and unimpressive, though the fence itself is the exact same as it always has been, maybe a bit of rust, fresh coats of paint, and at a time i used to sit with my back leaning into the hurricane fence, used it as a goal, bodychecked into it... always imposing prison like structure on our large concrete plain.  All that's left is style.. that will always be pushed, slightly, or massively.. sometimes springing from some unknown source. When observed on an evolving scale the earliest and simplest understandings often carry their seeds through all work... and there is some yet unknown style missing at every stage  spots alight  action  elevate

Ill artist.. he is made of some ninja hewn iron, I saw him beat this dude Gt. at dice twice, the only frickin rolls that Gt lost all night, that guy can roll, but Izzaxe foi en rien is fam straight up and down. word  anyway hanging out in the street as we were, and involved in a hip hop show as we were, the cops sort of lay back as long as things are chill, you could see popo a block away, parked , just observing things.  Good times  peace, geo

      parallel lines sweeping off into the eye's loss and one or more steps leads nowhere... loping and stumbling cross rough rock pathways eventual arrival fractioned by bipedal measure. rail balanced meters, and wooden plank dancing  each instant or so a green is visible, is elsewhere  suddenly and slowly a reflection rumbles forward once distantly  I await in a hedge, to duck, to be unseen unseen to hurtling eyes, largely unfocussed dwarfed by thundering mass  and then I sat cross legged centered between the now warm metal lines view infinite, sky above, perspective ahead and brushing my toe by wind a tiny flower's leafy stem a tiny yellow flower, set off by this rusty metal wall and that quarried collection of stones  as I lean in it blurs but begins to smell as some perfume might

      "Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; Whole misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their parents' strife. The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, And the continuance of their parents' rage, Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; The which if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend." -Shakespeare, romeo and juliet   Ahh cruel fate... a guy like me, chronic romantic, constantly (when alone) skirting across alternate universes of fantasy, prompted by the occasional beauteous glance from some angel, a guy like me doesn't get asked out often...  a guy like me, having freshly re-entered the world of those who seek companionship, newly minted will and manner, with a smile and a prayer, walks right into a relational bitchslap, one so sweetly delivered and by such a graceful hand...  see, the way things go, when you meet someone maybe you'd like to get to know them... sometimes, you feel like you already do...  and what then...                              time... gotta spend time with people..............  Ah, well, if there's no time, if fate intercedes, or has interceded, then what can you do..... if one person will soon be gone.  The truth is a bright light in the distance, for what of plans, and worrying for the future.. when all you can do is live in the present. It's so horribly wonderful, and as my heart doubles, rate and weight, and as those old nerves awake, breath shortens, as this happens I must embrace it all....  i just found an old piece of paper and something is written on it  (i was cleaning my room)... let's see if it applies.. let me get it... 2 things written:  1) "Un moine: Qu'y-a-til s'extrordinaire? Pai-chang: Etre assis seul sur le mont Ta Hsiung." 2) "Tout est vide, rayonnant et lumineux par soi meme: ne vous fatiguez pas l'esprit.  Ce n'est pas mesurable par la pensee at la connaissance ne peut le sonder" -Seng-Ts'an  quotes from an ex-girlfriends book on zen.... perfect   Well, reflection is as essential to this as it is to having the characteristics of a mirror...  all I know for sure right now.. on this topic... is I've found a reciprocating friend, who happens to be a joker, and beautiful, anything else is idle romantic speculation   Aaaah... idle romantic speculation :D

      So why are all my posts mostly serious, when I take so little seriously,.... was reminded of this when I read this lil number:  "A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes.  " -Wittgenstein  I loved Witt.'s work, and I'll get into that some other time.   FOr now, for all your philosophical comedy needs I'd say start with Bill Hicks George Carlin some people like Bill Maher, he's a'ight and more BILL HICKS if you can find the bootleg Bill Hicks "dark poet" a show recorded in Toronto of all places, where the audience not getting the humor makes Bill that much more ascerbic and i'd say on point than ever.  peep it  also, I am happy clamlike  I'd say "I'm dressed to the nines, look like one million bucks, and that's 9million reasons that you're shit out of luck." on some bragadaccio ish  peace, geo

      So i had another blog, and I never updated it past my initial post, here it is... more for me than for you From december 2003  ALL THESE MOMENTS:   so the world is going to end you say?  Well I'm fully cognisant of that, in fact it seems an instinctual understanding of that fact dwells deep in my neuro-cortical complex, my brain. Aware of my limitations, and the fact all matter tends to fall apart, and of course beside entropy, the simple physical state of being as countered by the definitive non-being, perhaps these are of the least importance- when faced with the inability to write a coherent sentence. So what can i do (millitary style): a list of commands, sequences and inevitabilities.......... so much time and all I've done is prepare in the most inefficient way possible.  Coupling passion and need, I shall endevour to make this phyiscal form one that will resist backing down. One with spring taught reflex arcs and the calm musculature of a swimmer. Well versed in beauty and function, star charts, bike mechanics, edible plants, paint mixing, light and perspective, map reading, instictual short cut following, silent movement, active vision and the ability to be sheltered through cunning and strategy.   Divine providence vs. all too human choice: a dance of light and darkness, balanced on the thinnest of needle points, lost somehow in a rotting haystack, warm and ergot rich.  to catch a thief... the run hiding fear and adrenalin form shaping on moonlight rooftops, dizzying vertigo and the cotton swab softness of the sounds of cities hearts at 3 am.  indeed the run and the capture, the sound of aerosol and the eventual photographic fossil....  strength within and without

      Advertising at it's best:  I'm half asleep and all of a sudden a lilting tune finds its way into my consciousness.  "i don't wanna grow up , I'm a toys R us kid, there's so many toys at toys r us that I can play with.' etc...  Haven't heard that ditty in years and years, yet, bless you toys r us, the design of that advertising campaign is such that it's effects that would outlast it's run in our popular media, some dark corner of my mind must be littered with such fragments of propagandic gaity.  And it's half true, i don't wanna grow up, but I've moved on to toys that TrU would be loath to provide.  Spraypaint, pen and ink, paper, papers, etc.. all of which keep me from whatever it would be that makes one a full fledged adult.  Honestly it is only certain ladies that make me want to embrace adulthood, and that doesn't last longer than our first shared embrace.  Then we'll see that the fun outweighs the fantasy, and that running in the rain barefoot might be the best option for all concerned, or we'll part.  And my part is still to be written, as is yours,  "But if I wake you in the night and I ask you who I am, Oh take me to the slaughterhouse, i will wait there with the lamb."-L.Cohen.  I don't think he means that we should know who we are, but rather that the worried questionning of such things is futile and makes that which is intuitional and spontaneous as well as what is clear-minded and disciplined about self discovery dissapear.  All the same I'll be playing in the mud, worried about the mud and enraptured by it, confused and certain, to a world beyond my comprehension, to a saint. A saint who is to me a woman draped in sunlight and pattern infinite decoration, golden sections upon golden sections, forehead lined with time wrinkles, who's voice is like the womb and wonder, sings lullabyes and holds the whole world in her hand, clutching it to her perfect breast, her tears like rains, of joy and sorrow.  peace, geo

      Every kilometer placed between me and then, every logical leap and bound, all forms that fade by the wayside.   From every position our relation changes, and our changing relation brings forth a perspective on what we are to begin with.  The relation is in your thoughts, the perspective comes from that observation of your own thoughts.  And the wind that crosses your breath is that of all human history.  Walking especially is so embedded in what it is to be a human, and many deny themselves even the smallest of those root actions, the things that draw us closer to our source, and perhaps to that time before our fall from the all-consciousness, some mental/physical eden of action/reaction.  Then there is the rhythm of footsteps, that beat coupled with that of our heart, and if we're lucky: birdsong and insect hum.  The music of movement so unlike today's honks and screeches, is irreplacable, i don't care what nature channels you get on the dish, or how hi-def your screen is, even super zoom surround sound won't cut it.  The silence, mountain top cloud cover and wind through leaves, the silence, that is all sound, is it white noise? the way white is all colours?  And the magic of life-death cycles, bookended by seed buds and rotting matter, all unavoidable execept by the most human escapism and modernity.  Even so, we return to that, at one point or another we can embrace it or be encased in it, like we lie in our caskets, those last vestiges of a disconnect we perpetrate in the name of _____________.

      So we headed off to the big apple, 43 of us or so, and the bus was unco-operative, and the booze was slightly cheaper, and there was nothing to do but get to know one another.  New York, arriving at 4 in the morning, lost, we looped the same block a few times.  Familiarity breeding, and quickly then up to sleep, to gain some hours of rest before what would surely be a taxing day.  The carlton arms hotel, pricey by my pocketbook, but awfully cheap compared to most alternatives.  Each room has a distinct purpose and design to it, each step revealing new visual treats. New york has few balconies, and fire escapes are narrow, but many buildings maintain rooftop access.  MAny rooftops overlooking yellow cab lined streets, and the sky was grey the whole weekend.  The next day, waking early, we headed out.      Now i'm not a compliacated man but getting lost in NY on your first day, winding up alone in monsoon like downpours can be a mite disconcerting, or at least it should be.  Two things came through, one was my co-worker Benedetto's advice to take cabs because they are cheap in NY, the other was when i arrived back at the hotel to change not only did street vendors have 3 dollar umbrellas for sale but I also bumped into some aquaintances from montreal whom i hadn;t expected to meet.  And they had a hook up to a house party at some writer's place in Brooklyn, I had to go.  So a brooklyn house party, what can i say, it had to be slightly dissapointing.  more to follow....

      What sort of cruel passion allows one to fall in love with a girl spotted on the other side of the metro tracks? An experience that lasted not a minute before the train came to sweep her away, and yet somehow, still, her turned ankle delicately escaping between dress and shoe is burned in my memory. The quiet rhythm her foot tapped out and the long dark hair framing her moon white face. The heartbeat rises even now, the rushing sound in the ears not far away in memory. Even 10 years later, several loves and lovers past, all burned into some memory bank, kept warm by some suvival mechanism, memories to be loosed by high or low extremes of emotion, perhaps balancing forces, or are they like pushes when you only want to get off the swing? When the force keeps you moving too quickly, and you ride it out or jump off and hope you land in the sand. She and I exchanged not twenty words in the two years we worked together.. and soon she was gone. But not from me, and I'm no psycho. She is just part of a whole, the many loves of a broken hearted man. What is this broken heart, I am fine, I operate succesfully in life, but am alone. I knew the broken heart was still there when I met her on the road and was head over heels without good reason. But what is the remedy? The simple acknowledgement that there is good reason. At that point anything is possible, one day I will take that collection of memories in an urn and will sprinkle it off a cliff, watching the ashes swirl in suddenly visible wind, and I'll be holding her hand. That moment will then be burned in both of our minds, and that bond, the memory, will be enough to sustain me for better or for worse, 'til death bids us part. Until I meet that girl, my broken heart is not blackened or cold, and I love and am loved, and that isn't dependant on memory at all.  "Oh je ne peut vivre sans toi, et je ne peut vivre avec toi, mais tu peut tres bien vivre sans moi, je suis foutu dans les deux cas.. I lost my baby, I lost my darling, I lost my friend, I lost my mind." -Jean LeLoup

      A; So anyway I think it is about time we get going..  B: I disagree, I'd say it is time we should be considering before allowing it to dicate what it is we do.  A: It is not about what it is about when.  B: When, but I say WHY?  I mean wait a second, do you even have a watch?  A: No  B: And I have no watch... what if we did nothing, and waited..  A:..How could we wait, without time?  B:I mean if we did nothing and sat here for 24 hours..  A; *coughs*   B:.. you know until we arrive at the exact same point in relation to the sun as we are at now, and if we didn't tell anyone, maybe we could enter this day again as if we hadn't missed a thing??  A: Yo, I cant even begin to point out the errors of your ways, time is in our cells, time is in the carbon particles so key to our being, time is the catalyst for the decomposition of things. If we could stop that then we'd be beyond time, maybe, in some senseless vacum.  B: Ok what about Time flying when you are having fun?  A; Maybe later, let's go.

      How is it that the mind and body flow in and out of tune with each other so often..?  I guess  it is just the mind changing...  is anything fixed, are there immovable objects when it comes to thought?  I've seen animals bite their feet off to get out of traps, limping away on bloody stumps for freedom.  "And where do all these highways go, now that we are free? Why are the armies marching still that were coming home to me? O lady with your legs so fine O stranger at your wheel, You are locked into your suffering and your pleasures are the seal." -Leonard Cohen  who is the stranger at the wheel, is it some bedevilment, some mad god, a fallen angel who's power we confuse for truth?  I recently sat by a rusted hunk of once-truth, bone dry and decomposing in the reeds, lost on some highway side, where painted metal sailed by unaware, lost in it's own machination. A wind blew through it's mangled half-self and the sound was like an ageless flute, one broken note soaring out from the forgotten, to the forgetfull.   Later some b-boys came by and we filmed windmills on the roof of an abandonned school bus in the same auto graveyard.... Then the owners arrived, and they kicked us out, apparantly dammaging the dammaged on too immediate a scale merits response.  Peace, geo

       I don't know if you've heard her music, it is something special to me. I have a good pal who works in the music industry and she enabled this intervew.. enjoy:      “One time I drove home to my mom's place in the outer suburbs from a late night waitressing shift in a downtown bar in Houston.  I was 18 and the moon was full and I was all alone, and felt that sort of magical calm you can feel on a night like that.  I kept finding myself staring at the moon and almost getting lost even though of course I knew the way home. When I killed the engine in front of my mom's place I got out and had a good look at the sky.  We were half in the country and everything was so still and quiet except for this super loud mockingbird singing in a big pine behind the house. Somehow his song was so powerful that it made the beautiful night seem like a stage set, as though only his song was real.” This is a moment of clarity, when truth becomes us, is not unlike a sensation I experienced while listening to the music of Jolie Holland.  It is also the story she told me when I asked her about capturing experiences through song.  That story is part of the inspiration behind ‘Periphery Waltz’, a track from Jolie’s first album, ‘Catalpa’.  Her music is steeped in a rich brew of American traditional music, blues, bluegrass and country, and sounds like some form of angelic wind whisper. You may have heard Jolie’s particular harmonies soaring across ‘the Be Good Tanyas’ first release, 'Blue Horse’, an album recorded while she spent a spell up in Vancouver.  The collaborative work with local Vancouver musicians proved to be fruitful as 'Blue Horse' was very well received, especially across Canada.  She relates that, “I am really thankful to the Canadian people for supporting their own artists and I feel very honored to have been able to share a band and to continue to make music with the women of the Be Good Tanyas.” However,  Jolie has a vision for her music distinct from that of the Tanyas and it is in her solo work that she is able to fully explore the spookily magical vision of her music and writing. Several of her songs lyrics are drawn from classic poems, for example 'The song of the wandering angus' by W.B. Yeats. I asked her about poems and she described that she “likes to hear poetry that expresses feel of real human energy and blood. That goes beyond culture and type of expression to me, it is a spiritual thing.” The songs on her latest album ‘Escondida' continue within that spirit though with admittedly much more studio polish, which undoubtedly altered the shine heard on her previous offering. By now many have heard the story of how herfirst album, which was essentially a  series of one off demo recordings, began to float about gathering acclaim for it's ghostlike melancholic bliss and was eventually released commercially on the epitaph sub-label Anti. ‘Escondida’ does present Jolie’s voice with much more clearness and definition, and also keeps the essence of her impromptu sound on some tracks, like the one-take ‘Mad Tom of Bedlam’ a swinging romp through this old traditional like nothing I’ve ever heard.  When I asked her if there was a great difference in the approach she took on Escondida as producer, in comparison to the more intuitional/live-sounding Catalpa she replied: "Well, they are really sort of worlds apart, but I tried to keep as live a sound as possible on Escondida--next record I'm making even more of a commitment to a live sound.  I am a bit embarrassed of my lack of experience with producing.I'm glad people like Escondida but I know I have a lot to learn about making records.  I hope I'll be more satisfied with the production of the next record." She also mentionned that she has already begun work on a new album with her band in California. In closing I asked Jolie a few personal questions, her favorite food is beets because, as she says, “borsht is so damn sexy”.  And when I asked her if she had anything to say to the folks out there she responded “Keep your heart open, stay involved in your neighborhood and region, buy your food from farmers, take care of your community, do what is best for the world and you and yours, be brave and polish your vision.” Sounds good to me.   The songsmith’s ability to communicate through sound and words is a precious thing, and Jolie seemingly has tapped into that very thing, that root from which the sublimity of musical expression sprouts.  I think then that it is appropriate to close out with something her dear friend CR Avery told her as they talked in a Vancouver alley:  “He said something that completely blew my mind, and it was such a big compliment that I had to "give the glory to God" as the Christians say, and the form that took for me was to write a song. He told me if it wasn't for me he wouldn't be playing music--I know he didn't mean just me personally--he meant that we are all each other's inspiration, and we have the honor of playing that role of inspiring each other. [That] is some powerful magic thing to say to somebody.”   urlLink     Jolie Holland’s Album Escndida is available everywhere on the label Anti. www.jolieholland.com www.anti.com Gb 2004

       NYC, last weekend. It would seem that the cities I know and new york are pretty comperable, it is just a matter of scale, and of history i suppose. The great thing about ny has to be the immediacy of your annonimity, you arrive with a group, and within that group there is a certain comfort, all the more magnified when held up against the great sprawl of unknown concrete. But if you slip from out of that group's shielding unity soon you may find your spirits tempered by a feeling of being entierly microscopic, a small bacteria barely skirting the surface of that big rotting apple. Soon you may find yourself dreaming of familiarity, while equivalent urges to discover and explore press you forward. You know I saw a few steets on my own and a few with friends and (apart from when confronted with unavoidably new yorkian landmarks) in a group I found the city to be nothing but a set of options, alone it becam a series of puzzles. At first I didn't even want to go, and I can't even get into explaining that, but once on the road my spirits were raised and soon after I was laughing inside at a fraction of myself that might have denied this to it's counterpart. Fear of the unknown counter-balanced by the excitement of discovery. A sometime scary fairytale of action and reaction. And of course what made this weekend of fairytale like status in my mind was undoubtedly the time I spent with a lovely young lady, she brought me to coney island and I felt then and after, something which has long escaped me. That soft warmpth and heart rate rising sensation which always speaks to more than primal attraction, and always ends in either the zeniths or nadirs of one's emotional landscape. Mabye there is something there, i imagine not, more than us I am simply glad to have recaptured a sense I thought that a broken heart may have had forever taken from me. The captivating and energizing force of what passes between people as they embark, perhaps, on a journey to their heart's desire. There is a duality in all things, and I believe this carries over to our soul/spirit, and if I find in this life that other part of my s/s.... like those broken heart pendants, that join perfectly matched broken hearts elsewhere.  I hope oneday I at least encounter that woman... and then I will wait til you return or I find you again, it reminds me of this Yeats I'm planning on illustrating: "and I will find where she has gone, and kiss her lips and take her hand, and we'll walk through long dappled grass and pick til time and times are done, the silver apples of the moon, the golden apples of the sun."
