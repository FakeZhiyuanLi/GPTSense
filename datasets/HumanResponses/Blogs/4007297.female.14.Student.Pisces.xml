      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Diary, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was so ashamed of myself for the past few weeks as I was badly influenced by my friends to take drugs, make crime legal and even got myself behind bars for three days.I did not know why I had quit school just because I had failed an exam and thinking that this top pupil in the school is a failure.I did not anyone to 'label' me as a failure but as a top student and I did not know what to do that I got advice from the wrong group.I started to quit school since I failed exams then started to take drugs and steal then all of the 'fun' days were gone as I was caught for stealing and smuggling drugs.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had regretted my action and now that I learnt that action has it consequences,I never dared to do such things again in my life again.I was so ashamed until today that I never dared to show my face to the world outside as I knew that I would be 'labelled' and people would be calling me names and pointing fingers at me.I learned that if I failed in my life,I should not be bad but learn from my mistakes and know for myself that failure is always part of success and that we always make mistakes that people who are forgiving can forgive.Now,my life in school was perfect and everybody forgived my mistake as they too knew that everyone makes mistakes.I was even awarded most sedately looking pupil.
