       It's Monday once again, after a short break over the weekend,its funny how time flies nowadays and how you can never get things done, no matter how much effort or planning you've put into them. August is one month that I feel-the days and nights went by in a flash...  Was in the car, on the way to work earlier and there was this one Kancil, which was following me so close from behind. The unbelieavable thing is that, I was doing 140 and so how much was the chap doing? By the look on his face and the passenger sitting right next to him, I could tell that he's a student, studying in the college somewhere near my office or maybe he's a working guy. But they looked young and were pretty excited-being able to hog me like that. I gave way and they went so fast that, for a few moments there, I was praying that their tyre would go *FLAT*!!! ...because they were not worried at all about their safety. Do they know that it's Kancil they're driving, not a bloody Mercedes and even if it is a Mercedes, it's dangerous still for a 17 year old kiddie to drive in such a way. I am not old but I'm not a teenager anymore, I have been there and done that...BUT...I didn't interfere with anybody's life during that time and I did it, with full consideration in mind that, I would bear all the consequences,alone. On my own, of course parents are parents and they'd always worry about things, that you can't stop them. It's a natural instinct embedded in parents, a speacial gift from god. If not,Moms would be walking around leaving their kids and home and shop at Malls...'Why bother about Baby Cemara? No , she'll be fine, she can drink her milk from the bottle by herself.She can suckle later..' We all don't what that, trust me. So, kids or teenagers like those I came across this morning, they're not really bad..they're just at that age where, they rule everything...Hope one of them will turn out to be a successful someone, if not all....  Got to work on something, will continue later.
