      Where can I start, how do I start to explain what happened last night? It's often said that it is hard to put emotions into words. I never realised how hard until now, in the past I've always managed somehow.  I know mere words will never come close to how I felt as Danny placed the collar round my neck. It's the most beautiful and precious thing I've ever been given. Intwined links of platinum, thin as cord, twined together in a complicated and beautiful twist. And at the center the heart shaped platinum lock that's been etched so it glitters in the light. In the center of the lock sits a heart shaped garnet on mirrored platinum, causing the garnet to glow. Danny even had an inscription put on my collar, it reads, "Our hearts bind us... these chains remind us..."  He wears the garnet embedded key to my collar on a chain of platinum round his neck. It's there for everyone to see, but what you can't see is that it's the key to my heart too.   We didn't speak for what seemed like an eternity afterwards, or should I say we couldn't speak.  You see mere words were simply not enough, so he just held me in his arms as I trembled.   My Master calls me "His angel in chains", I can't find the words to truly express how I feel about Daniel Sterns. It's clear to anyone that looks into my eyes how much I adore him, so I'll simply use one of my favourite quotes. "Slavery, and the only slavery, is service without love."  (Edward Estlin Cummings)

      Last night I lost my heart, and today I move home. Today is the first day of a new chapter in my life. I have no idea where it will lead me, all I know is that I feel so safe and happy with my Master. Of course there will be both good and bad days, but I know that with Danny I'll get through them. And hopefully I'll be a little stronger when I come out the other side.

      I have decided to write this as a way of passing some time on this flight home.&nbsp; I sit here in my seat next to an American business man, next to him sits a girl, she is quiet and originally from Ireland.&nbsp; I have noticed the man paying particular attention to the collar round my neck, when he does I just smile.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I took particular care to dress for this journey back to New York, back to my Master.&nbsp; I have left my long hair loose, I think I have brushed it a thousand times.&nbsp; I decided to wear one of the dresses Danny bought for my trip, shoes to match.&nbsp; When I arrive home I want to look as good as I can for him.&nbsp; It won't be long till I land now, using conventional time methods of course.&nbsp; I constantly complain about how&nbsp;long time has taken to pass while I've been away.&nbsp; Now I'm nearly home, my heart beats faster, but the time passes slower than ever.  &nbsp;

      It feels like tomorrow will never come, I know it will but not soon enough!  I just wish I could close my eyes and when I opened them again I'd be with him.  There is no going back to my old life now.  The few doors I left open as a just in case, have now been firmly locked.  If I ever wanted to go home to England I would have to start from scratch, with everything.  I ask myself is England really home anymore?  They do say home is where the heart is.  I have purposely closed those doors, because I am certain I have chosen the right path.  I belong with my Master, these five days apart have just reinforced that.  I feel like I wil faint when I think of what it will be like to go home to him.  That's right I said home...because home truly is where the heart is.  All I can say is I love him, because I truly do.

      I continue to count the hours till I will be back home with my Master.  I've had time to think about things while I've been away.  I know more than ever where my heart belongs and that's to Daniel Sterns.  I have also thought about my friends, my close friends.  Even though they may tell me they are happy for me, I know some of them aren't. I know they have concerns, and that's only because they care.  I also believe that some aren't happy because their own plans for me have now been ruined.    I have taken myself off of the market by choosing to belong to Danny.  That's right I said choosing, a hard concept for some to accept I know.  I think some would rather think he had somehow forced me into wearing his collar.  He didn't, no one could ever force me into anything.  Just  because i'm a slave it doesn't mean i'm a doormat.  I have been away from home for three days now, my heart aches for my Master.  I love him, adore him, my heart doesn't feel whole, and I know it won't till I return to him.  I carry the locket Danny gave me everywhere with me.  It has a picture of us inside wrapped in each others arms.  I grasp it in my hand when I try to sleep at night.    So as I count the hours till I am back kneeling before him I have come to this conclusion.  Maybe people can't understand or except something they have never truly known or felt.  It is possible to serve and love and be loved.  In fact I think if people are a little more honest it's the fairytale most slaves dream of.

      Tomorrow I leave my Master for five days, a trip I can't get out of, something that was arranged months ago.  My heart aches already, I have prepared everything for my departure this morning.  At least when Danny gets home I'll be able to spend every second with him.  Alot of things have changed since Monday, Danny attended the auction on Wednesday evening.  When he came home he wasn't alone, he had bought Alexis and she now lives with us. Any anxiety that I felt about the possibility of another in our home has long vanished.  She is a joy to have around and great company for me, I can only hope she feels the same.  Yesterday was hard, Danny had to punish me I am so disappointed in myself.  I deserved every stroke of the cane, as he delivered each stroke I could still feel his love.  I know I screamed, but that was nothing to the screaming of my heart.  Afterwards Danny tenderly administered ointment to help the healing process.  He then made me lay in bed on my stomach, not allowing me to move.  As he lay there next to me I cried, I cried into the pillow.  My tears fell for two people not one, I know how much it hurt him to punish me, I should have never put him in that position.  My physical pain pailed into insignificance as I looked into his hurting eyes.  As we lay there together Alexis arrived home, Danny had her bring some drinks and cook dinner, which she fed to me as I lay there.  Even though I didn't think I would be able to eat I somehow did.  Dinner was amazing as was Alexis, I knew I wouldn't be able eat a dessert on my own.  So Alexis and I shared, still feeding me, alternating spoonfulls between us.  Finally allowed to move dessert was finished in a very different way.  As I sit here writing I look at my watch, Danny and I celebrate our anniversary tonight.  It's two weeks since he placed this collar round my neck, I'm just glad I didn't have to leave today. Tonight I will cook a celebration dinner for us, I have the list of groceries in front of me.  As I look at it I have to smile, never let it be said that Daniel Sterns doesn't have taste and style.  So I will focus on tonight and worry about tomorrow when it arrives.  I will count every minute till I get back home.  While i'm gone I will do my best to make him proud in everything I do.    I know while i'm gone I won't feel complete, I never am unless he's by my side.

      I am filled with nerves, tonight Danny and I attend an event.  It's an owners panel, I shouldn't be nervous at all, all I have to do is sit and listen.  But I am nervous and I just can't help it.  I know why, everyone will be there, and it will be the first formal function we've been to since he collared me.  There is of course another reason why my stomach is on a rollercoaster ride, I've brought it on myself.  I just couldn't help it, I have been in a mischievous mood all day.  So when Danny called me up from work I just couldn't help myself.    I thought I'd take advantage of the fact that he was on the other end of the phone and not in front of me.  A few witty comments later and I knew I was in a whole heap of trouble.  So for all my bravado on the phone earlier, I now tremble with a mixture of emotions, anticipation, arousal and anxiety feature strongly.  Maybe I'll be able to wriggle my way out of it?  No, I don't think I could, more importantly I don't even know if I'd want to!

      I haven't wrote anything here since Sunday, things have been pretty hectic for me.  Most of this week seems to have gone in a blur, a happy blur, but a blur none the less.  I didn't think it was possible to love my Master more than I did, but as everyday goes by I find I do.    It is in my very nature to serve, to live within set boundries, boundries set by another.  Before I came here I found, much to my disappointment, that I have always been able to push those boundries.  It has never ceased to amaze me up untill now, how easy it is to top from the bottom.  Being able to do that may sound like fun, and maybe for some people it is, but not for me.  I can now say with a smile on my face that Danny does not miss a trick.  And believe me I've tried all the things that have worked in the past!  None of them work, the boundries don't move unless he wants them too.  I can't say that it doesn't frustrate me sometimes, because it does.  However, I can say he continually keeps me striving to serve him better, forever challenging me.  That's what I've always dreamed of, belonging to someone strong enough to be able to do that.  I think he knows my thoughts better than I do sometimes.  He knows what I need and when to give it to me, being with someone who knows you that well can be scary.  It's a nice kind of scary though, one I thought I'd never find.

      I haven't wrote here for nearly a month and it's really is a question of where to start. I got back home and things changed a little. My darling friend Angela returned from vacation and took a new job, a job as a Spotter. She became a Spotter for the very organisation I was so sure I wanted to be part of as a slave, the Marketplace. So I became her first spot, but only after Danny had given me my freedom, that was the only possible way I could enter into this. So I chose to try to go through the marvellous system of being spotted, trained and then sold. And that's when I found out what I really did want. There was no guarantee that I would be able to return back home to Danny at the end of it. Yes, I'd end up back there one day, 'but when', was the question. Also I would have to leave Danny while I trained, and as much as both he and Angela encouraged and supported me I just couldn't do it. I believe I have said before 'home is where the heart is, Danny Sterns is my hearts home.  So home I came to Danny and to my joy Angela as supportive as ever agreed to move in with us. I don't think anyone could imagine my excitment as I got her room ready for her, my Mistress was going to stay with me. I should explain that statement, you see Angela and I used to play when I first arrived in the City. We were friends, lovers, playmates and she was my Mistress. Sometimes we switched and I would be hers, but normally Angela took the lead. When she returned from her vacation she found I had moved in with Danny. Yes of course I had my freedom from her when she left, but I know it shook her to the core to come home and find I had moved in with some man. After what can only be described as a rocky start between Danny and Angela a firm friendship has emerged. Only in my wildest dreams could I imgaine the fairytail of being able to live with them both.  Just to confuse everyone reading this further.....things have now changed yet again. As I write this I am preparing for my wedding on the 11th of September. Danny asked me to marry him, I must admit I was a little confused by this. After all I'm his slave already, but my confusion didn't last long as he explained why. You see Danny wants to be with me on every level possible, as I do with him. I think I mentioned Danny is an Owner within the Marketplace, well to make your head spin a little more I'll tell you of another change. Following my engagement I have become an Owner too, I know what you are all thinking. How can she possibly be a slave and an Owner all at once? It's quite simple really and it makes perfect sense, this way I get to attend the official MP functions, and if Danny's ever out of town for a while I can buy a slave to assist in the running of our home and businesses.  Although, I do already have a darling slave of my own, no one could ever replace her and she wasn't purchased from an auction. Both Danny and I trust her completely, and we both love her dearly. She is so special and precious and I don't know what I would do without her. At the moment she is up to her eyes in my wedding arrangements too. Oh that reminds me, I must run and keep my appointment about the invitations!
