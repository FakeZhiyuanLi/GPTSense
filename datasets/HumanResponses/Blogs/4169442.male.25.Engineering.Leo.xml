        Living ? Have a look at the living! Dancing blindly, losing balance . Will you choose pain or will you prefer "the penance"?" The living and the undead - penance and pain. Light and dark, into paths ahead: Death to Rebirth or "life undead"". Life on one side, the Undead on the other side - the darkest side. let me (not) join you in your sleep.

       I am not a physicist and all my physics comes from cramming of laws et all that I had to do to pass my high school classes and faking the experiments to pass the practical exams. I clearly remember times when I started my experiments by first writing out the result (slightly different from the actual result, to encounter for possible human error during experimentation) and then working my way back in filling out the remaining values, thus displaying a perfectly done experiment.    One of those experiments was   "Using rotating mirror to measure the speed of light,"   more popularly known as   "Foucault's method"  . As ususal, I started:   Result:   The experiment shows that the speed of light is  2.988 E + 8      m/s   .    Ping! the realization hit me. If that is the speed of light, then   what is the speed of darkness?

          Antonius Rex/Jacula    Amidst the depths of obscurity, this almost unknown band from Italy will spring an eerie surprise to any purveyor of Extreme metal.  It is a universally accepted fact that Black Sabbath are quite the orignators of metal. Well, not really so. A singular spin of "Jacula -  In cauda semper stat venenum"should be enough to drive home the fact that dark music in the form of rock/metal did exist before Black Sabbath. What impresses most about this classic is its sheer progressive nature. Not only this album easily stands up to brilliant progessive epics of bands like Van der graaf generator, camel but also at the same time is as dark/doomish as the best doom metal bands till date.   Check out http://www.italianprog.com/a_antonius.htm for more info. Mp3's can be found at spleen.no-ip.org - A doom metal hub on direct connect.

      Historically, products of human creativity in any form have manifested itself in various levels of seriousness. While, some artists have purported their work for entertainment purposes (read: popular music in any form, be it metal), there have been many others who have sought to channelize the human mind to newer realms of consciousness via a visionary theorization of ideals which may be the core or some kind of a  personal emotive skeleton upon which their art is based. Whether ideology creates art or vice-versa can be best answered as one cross-creates the other.   Sartre and Jeffery archer may both write stories, but it would be criminal negligence on the part of a reader to ignore the finer aspects of a Sartre work and merely absorb its popcorn elements. Such a reader at best can be described as hollow.  With regards to Black Metal as an art, the case is no different. There are various sorts of bands. Whoever feels that the bands they listen to, do not think in a profound manner is simply listening to the wrong bands. A lot of bands have deep ideals and are very well read in the philosophies of Nietzsche, Ezra pound, Schopenhauer etc which is very apparent in their lyrics/interviews. Surely ignoring such aspects of their music is to miss the complete point. But, every consumer has a different level of perception & intelligence. So, it is ludicrous to expect similar levels of understanding by all.  BM espouses a lot of ideals which are very well enumerated in the SRP article already posted here (http://www.anus.com/etc/people/srp/ideas/black_metal.txt ). That is the generic ideology behind it. If certain listeners feel the need the need to kill people and burn churches as a part of accepting the ideology, so be it. BM has been extremely fortunate to have had bands who have led by example. As a nihilist, I wouldn’t condemn such acts, but at this stage in my life, to be caught doing them would defeat the very purpose of them. At their very least, such ideals are educative and adopting them takes one closer to being a ‘hyperborean’ in Nietzschean terms.  So in conclusion, it is unhealthy to assume that ideology is not important. Such stereo-typical, mainstream, hollow thinking has no place in BM or for that matter in any serious music.

        Once upon a time there was a king........so many of our childhood stories have started on this note. How many stories can you remember that you have heard? Stories, fantasies and fairytales are the stuff that we have grown up on. But have you ever wondered, that it is the most passionate act that humans commit...storytelling.          It is something everone does. Each of us tries to tell stories, does manage to tell them, with some success.If you were to listen to a person recount an incident, you could analyse it to realise how much of it is just a story. But then we call it bragging, which is not something to be looked up to. There are other forms of storytelling though. Every movie is the attempt to tell you a story. Every poem you read is a story in prose, every song you hear is a story in harmony.       Why is this? Why do we humans have this drive to tell stories? What is it? Is ita form of expressing our imagination? Is it due to the fact that we grew up listening to stories? Is it so that those who heard a lot of fairytales in their childhood grow up to become accomplised film directors? Do they become good song writers? What about those who did not have that loving mom who put them to sleep with a story? What about those who did not have a grandpa to rely on to fire their imagination? Do they have stinted imagination? Do they grow up to be unable to tell stories?     Does this ability to tell stories make our existence any better? Do strong storytelling abilities imply better dream recollection powers? As for dreams, a person with a good imagination will have tremoundous dreams, what if we could capture these vivid dreams?        Consider a scenario where you go to bed with a few electrodes attached to your brain. These electrodes pick up the pulses from your brain and a machine converts these low power brain pulses to images. You get up in the morning remove the cd from the machine and just play it watch your dream on a computer screen. With this type of power in your hands....you can become a dream merchant overnight. Where production houses are spending millions of dollars to make high quality special effests movies, you could be making them overnight.     With such a device at their disposal, shriks will feel their job very simple, cause if you r able to peep into your patients mind, where the problemlies, then all you have to do is pinpoint it and rectify it. What if the machine could be operated in the reverse way, that you have a visual graphic which you convert to pulses and feed them to a person when he is asleep. He wakes up to have no clue why he has this strong urge to do something. now that would not be a very pleasant scenario.  Santosh

       Neuroimaging Studies   This is an introductory article to the upcoming postings about dreams and dream interpretation. It should get the reader prepared for easier comprehension of coming articles. The fifth point makes interesting reading, I would love to get responses on it especially. They are a mapping of sleep stages, although one research group did collect dream reports from several REM awakenings as well as one non-REM (NREM) awakening (Maquet, 2000, p. 224). Dreaming is highly correlated with REM, but sleep stages are an imperfect indicator of dreaming because there is at least some degree of dreaming in NREM (Foulkes, 1966; Foulkes, 1985; Hobson, Pace-Schott, & Stickgold, 2000a). To connect neuroimaging work more closely to the process of dreaming, there is a need for studies of NREM periods from which dreams are reported, and of REM periods where no dreams are recalled upon awakening (Maquet, 2000, p. 224). It would be especially useful to have studies of Stage II NREM after the first four REM periods because many dreams seem to occur at this time (Antrobus, Kondo, & Reinsel, 1995; Cicogna, Natale, Occhionero, & Bosinelli, 1998). The primary source of neuropsychological information on dreaming is a study by Solms (1997) in which 361 consecutive neurological patients were asked in great detail between 1985 and 1989 about any changes they had noticed in the frequency and nature of their dreaming since their injury or illness. Solms then integrated the results with the findings from 73 published studies in the neurological literature that mention deficits and excesses in dreaming. Twenty-nine of the 361 patients turned out to be free of any brain lesions. They were used as a control group because they had been faced with the possibility of brain injuries, admitted to the hospital, and subjected to the same routines and tests as the patients who did suffer lesions. The responses from the remaining patients concerning changes in their dreaming were correlated with the findings from their neurological tests and brain scans. Solms then focused on those patients with focal brain lesions so that causal inferences about specific regions of the brain could be made. These analyses led to the conclusion that there are two different types of dreaming "deficits"-- loss of visual dreaming and complete loss ("cessation") of dreaming. There are also two types of dreaming "excesses"-the intrusion of dreaming into waking thought and increased nightmare frequency.  The Solms study provides seven specific findings relating dreaming and neurological structures.  First, 200 of the 332 patients with brain lesions reported no changes in dreaming. This is highly useful information because it reveals those parts of the brain that are not necessary for dreaming. Instead of the diffuse cortical activity suggested by EEG recordings using scalp electrodes, the neural network for dreaming is surprisingly localized and does not include vast areas of the brain that are essential to waking cognition-- the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the sensorimotor cortex, and the primary visual cortex. For example, lesions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that cause waking deficits of self-monitoring and decision-making have no effect on dreaming.  Second, Solms found changes in dreaming due to injuries in the medial occipito-temporal region of the visual association cortex in two patients. One lost all visual imagery in dreams for a short time, and the other was able to see static dream images from time to time. Both had highly specific lesion sites and deficits in waking mental imagery. These findings correspond with 13 cases that go back to the 1880s in the neurological literature, including cases with losses of facial imagery or color vision in dreaming.  These findings are of theoretical interest because they show that the neural network for dreaming has considerable specificity. They are also of interest because the visual impairments in dreaming have parallel waking deficits, which suggests that the network has close relationships with at least some aspects of waking mental imagery.  Third, Solms found 47 patients with either unilateral or bilateral injuries in or near the region of the PTO junction who reported complete loss of dreaming. They also showed a decline in waking visuospatial abilities. This discovery led to the hypothesis that the cortical network for spatial representation, centered in the inferior parietal lobes and important in the creation of waking mental imagery, is essential for dreaming. Solms also reports there is even some evidence that the left parietal region "contributes symbolic (quasispatial) mechanisms to the dream process whereas the right parietal region contributes concrete spatial mechanisms. However, any claim by a patient that dreaming has been lost raises the possibility that it may be memory for the dream that has failed. Evidence that these patients actually have ceased to dream comes first from the fact that those who reported loss of dreaming were no more likely to have memory disorders than those who reported that they continued to dream (Solms, 1997, pp. 160-161).  Fourth, Solms found that patients with bifrontal lesions in the white matter inferior to the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles, in the ventromesial region, also reported loss of dreaming. This area provides a crucial link between the basal forebrain and limbic structures on one side and many parts of the frontal cortex. The evidence for the importance of this area is based on only nine cases, but the finding is strengthened by the results from studies of leucotomized schizophrenics that were previously overlooked in the dream research literature. These studies report the loss of dreaming in 70-90% of the hundreds of schizophrenic patients who were leucotomized between 1940 and 1975 as a way to control their symptoms.  Fifth, 10 of Solms's patients reported an increased frequency and vividness of dreaming, often accompanied by the intrusion of dreaming into waking life. They also said that their dreams now seemed more realistic. The most frequently involved areas were the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the basal forebrain. Some of these patients said that they felt like they were always dreaming, or that their thoughts quickly turned into pictures or realistic events, which suggests to Solms (1997, pp. 198-199), following an idea presented by Luria (1973), that they had lost the "selectivity of mental processes." Observations by members of the hospital staff support the idea that these patients were suffering from a confusion between dreaming and waking thought. Whitty and Lewin (1957) report several similar cases. Damasio et. al. (1985, p. 269) describe their patients with similar lesions as suffering from "waking dreams." It is also noteworthy that the medial prefrontal cortex is involved in processes of arousal and attention in waking life, and that injuries to this area can lead to confabulation and compulsive fabrication (Braun et al., 1997; Hobson et al., 2000b, p. 808). Sixth, Solms found that injuries to the temporal lobe caused increased nightmares of a repetitive nature for 9 patients, 5 of whom had symptoms of epilepsy. In keeping with this discovery, there are many instances in the literature of epileptics reporting nightmares, which are often caused by temporal-lobe seizures during NREM. These patients sometimes suffer from daytime hallucinations as well.  Seventh, and finally, Solms had 53 patients with brainstem lesions who were able to state whether or not they continued to dream. Forty-three "reported a preservation of the subjective experience of dreaming" (Solms, 1997, p. 154 ). Solms believes these results show that REM is not necessary for dreaming. However, his findings are not fully convincing on this issue because it is very difficult to eliminate REM even with experimental lesions in animals . It show that future studies of the presence or absence of dreaming in people without REM may be possible. for additional information onthe above study please refer http://psych.ucsc.edu/dreams/TSSOD/sample.html Santosh.

      Tragedy is the essence of human existence. It is the most important and relevant emotion that a person experiences. Without tragedy and sorrow and grief and sadness, all other emotions are meaningless. It is in pain and suffering that one realises the emptiness of people and things around him. This is what eventually leads him to a better undersatnding of himself.  We have learnt in our school time geography how there are three parts of water for every part of land on this planet. In the same way there are three moments of sorrow for every part of hapiness that you experience.  How were you born? If the memory is unclear, ask your mother......you were born crying. When the doctor held you by your feet, you were crying. When he handed you to your mother you were still crying. And then, what was the first thing that you were taught? you were were taught to smile. You had to be tickled and made to burst out laughing. It had to be taught to you, it did not come naturally. But crying did. To express discomfort, to ask for food, all you did was cry cause it came naturally. For every time that you were tickled and made to laugh, there were three times when you cried.   Laughter and smiles are something that dont come naturally to us humans. It is but a good disguise, cause once you learn it, it is the simplest thing to do. It is a veil we often use to hide the emotion that comes to us naturally, grief.  Pain is what is real, you can feel it. Can you feel hapiness? Ask again. You may think you can. But what about when it is in someonelse? Have you felt the hapiness someone else is feeling? Have you felt the pain someone else is feeling? Yes you have. If you haven't, try inflicting it. In hapiness you are lost, in pain you realise.   .....Santosh.....

      There are times, when you find yourself in a state of self-drool.  Consiousness, not really batting an eye,  but a tragic trance lulls over. Noiseless, ceaseless threads of thought running concurrently without any remarkable purpose, everything pointing a finger towards an impending doom. Can you classify any of the instincts which drive us ? The red glow of an LED holds you transfixed. Looking, staring ahead you worm your eye over the thin lesser visible threads of faint glowing red and you know how fucked up you are. How fucked up life is ?  Don't you dismiss this as a frustated rant.  No, never, what the fuck is there to be frustated against. Nothing is worth any  sort of importance, especially the things which we specifically think are important.   I bought a prized knife yesterday to carass the inner thighs of a pretty girl.  A knife can serve so many fucking purposes. If only a good percentage of humans could be half as resourceful.  FUCK REDEMPTION. If you can't make any sense out of this you are foolish.

      A perky workout, good dinner, a crisp smoke - all climax into a pleasant night,  if the weather chills your bones enough. Why do you ponder over your life then ? Well, actually its always when you have received a setback in your life that you begin to ponder over its  various nuances. When the going is good,  the worries are far more subtle. Like how chilled a beer is, or perhaps how potent the joint is, whatever, its those trivialities we mull over. So, I have received numerous setbacks, both on my personal and professional front. They have demeaned me like how we would kick a fucking leper without a bell, begging for alms or leftovers. life always treats me such and most times maybe I have deserved it, but there are times I have not, and those times haven't been few.  We all go through rough weather in different ways and they all tell me to pray to GOD. Isnt that like complete submission of your self, when you have to beg to someone to set everything in order. I can't think of anything more pathetic. If that is what GOD wants, how different is he from a raving fetish monger ? And I thought only my professors were that depraved.

      One of those days when the weather is good, your stomach fucked, you have loads to study, but your mind races ahead to oblivion. A glance through the window and you see sassy chicks cutting across in short, summery skirts. And you think of the word 'beautiful', like you think of heaven as beautiful. The mind gropes against the digressions, wanting, panting, resisting but has to give in. The tedious trouble of resolving the 'self' and the vicious realization of the fact, that the mind enslaves.

      allo 'stranger' =)  How how ..? what what.. ? Please fill up the blanks *flutters eye* We sail, sail, we are ravaged and then we will be saved.  me, you and we. it isnt ? Though, I know(just) that you won't try to breathe sense into this. But an ornate glow from some obscure corner within me, will/must shade, eclipse or lilt you.yay ! Heh.  But, but I saw her impale herself upon a knife, which should cut the food upon her plate. The irony is that she is a vegetarian. Isn't torment what they call as hell ?  Men and women, childen and animals, caught in a weed of order, driven by chemistry equations, that can make Alchemists cream their pants. If you fill the void within, with a fungoid, what can you blame, when it ostracizes you from the eyes of your mind?

      It’s cold……….. Harsh, coarse, rugged cold !!!  The sensations are obviously manifold!! A thousand needles blunted and trained not to hurt the most-sensitive fabric. An experience, encapsulating constant waves of that addictive harshness. The cold is not an imagination. It’s a part of the ambience.  The time of the day would befuddle even those who haven’t slept. Dusk it can be,…. Dawn, a distinct possibility, ……..a cloudy afternoon isn’t too far fetched either!! The lights are surrounded only by the naked penumbra. They break the wavelengths into countless scattered but naïve children. The halo is nothing less of divinity.  The smell…ahh the unforgettable olfactory experience!!! It is not everyday that one can actually smell the universe….. Smell the soul!!  The warm exhale on the upper lip is enough to kindle a thousand fires.   The distant discussions of the birds are almost inaudible. The footsteps on gravel (oh that mind-bogglingly beautiful sound!!!), over-shadow them. It’s hard to differentiate the waves from the metaphoric ones!!   The surroundings are so nakedly inept, they resemble a truth…….of the naked kind. But the vivid intricacies terminate the misleading!!  It’s almost vulgar to assume serenity in these conditions…. to build an impenetrable fortress with neither intention nor content. But the sin is quite understandable, not to mention pardonable.  This, I proclaim, is the time when the mythical SELF unleashes itself. It’s an unforgiving experience.  Perversions of truth,…..(or any versions for that matter) , do not exist in these moments. A perfect ambience cannot tolerate imperfections, baring exceptions to none.   The expectoration begins………………………………………………………It ends.   Retribution was never sought as passionately as now !!  The vulgarity is gloriously untouched, if not empowered. It is embellished forthwith only by its vanity.  Silence……and not a moment too soon !

        A random question comes to mind. The question after passing thru a ND (neuro pulse-to-digital pulse) converter is fed to the tranceiver which is located in your jaw.    The tranceiver transmits the signal to the reciever in your desktop computer. Sensing 'interesting traffic', the wireless LAN connection auto fires and sends the packet to google. The search reults are filtered, processed, best link selected and contents of the page are transmited back to the jaw based tranceiver.    The ND feeds it back to the brain and you have the answer even before you could trouble your mind to think about it. Drastic leaps in technology? Scary? ---Santosh---

      Penting up the dying vestiges of boldness, he looks at her pass by. She was also there yesterday at the impossibly arc-ed bridge when he stood waiting for the cab. Bile rising up like stale semen inside a condom, when you wiggle it upwards. Squeaking, slimy and possibly distasteful. He felt as if his innards were exposed to a conscious ooze of diluted nitric-acid. It was such a fucking normal day. Even his eye-lids felt the same as they ever did, which is the way the tender part inside his nose felt when exposed to noxious bad-breath. It was the first time in years he had felt warmth.   When she had gazed into his eyes. Her whole being was her eyes. Woeful, lusty, wet and captivating. It was how a skilled painter would depict beauty with visual adjectives. He sensed a loud screech and saw her lying disdainfullly on the asphalt. Two women got down from a car and stood watching her die in awe. He did know the carnal secrets of either of them. His whole being now concentrated on regaining composure which had infact never left him.  How could it ? Did he ever feel anything except when they tongued him ? It was only a bitch after all. And that too a mongrel of the commonest kind..

        A quarter. Thats all. Just a quarter of the sun remains above the shoreline. Dusk.Orange,amber,yellow.Mixed and sprayed all around. Beautiful but repeated.The same serenity is repeated everyevening like the wholesome woman who walks up and down the beach. Left to right, right to left...she walks,she momentarily blocks, the sun from my view. The sway of her breasts, in harmony with the ebbs of the sea. Both  beautiful, both repeated. Oh! so monotonous, so boring.   Why do we like the sunset? What makes humans admire so oft repeated a sight? What if it wasn't this way? What if we were to marvel at the sun when he is high up? Blazing,scorching,sweltering. Mid noon. Thats when we should look up to him. Steal our glance away from his unberable self and hence marvel and appreciate his might.    Why do we marvel at a woman's breasts? What makes men salivate looking at them? Why not some other part of her? What if we were to marvel at her arms? So fleshy are her biceps that fill out the sleeve of her blouse. Attempting to grasp that smooth circumference of her arms should be the ideal fantasy.    Hot afternoon sun tanning the smooth tender arms captivated by her a-size-too-tight blouse. Tracing the bead of sweat roll down from behind her ear, all the way till it's absorbed by her shirt. A thick puff of automobile smoke eclipsing the harsh glare of  the sun on her skin.    That's what should turn-on a tough don't-mess-with-me kind of guy . Doesn't it sound appropriate? or does it sound like a fetish? ---Santosh---

        Bandra station. Chaos, confusion, no connection. Leaning out of the train did deodourize my shirt, but my mind still reeks of alcohol. My senses numbed with hashish.   A cigarette is lit. Paranoia restarts. Are those cops starin at me? Is that guy goin to stab me in the back? Will I die here in the streets of Bandra, under my own private jute sack?   Paranoid confusion prevails as I reach the bus-stop and await arrival. The mist around my brain clears a little as I wipe the perspiration from my forehead and lo behold!! I see her.    Fair of skin beyond comprehension of all men, so graceful her stride, it seems a fairy dropped down with the sole purpose of holding me spellbound. Simple Harmonic Motion redefined, the sway of her hips gets my heart in sync. Love at first sight.    She looks around from afar, waiting for a client. Roxanne, you dont have to turn on the red light. No matter what you did so far, no matter how many blemished the cloth of your soul. I love you for what you are. I love you more than my whole.     Fallen in a love so sudden, so deep that I dont feel my knees, I decide to walk upto her. But what do I say to her? Shall I say 'theres an angel on my shoulder, in my hands a sword of gold.  Let me wander in your garden and the seeds of love I'll sow'.     Stumbling with hashish, reeling with vodka, I walk upto her. This is it!! Cupid looks on , time stops in its tracks and the buses too. Should I just grab her from behind? Tap her shoulder?  Slit her back? Stab her spine? With a cacophony in my mind I near her and the dream just shatters.    Oh! How I loved you since the moment of my approach. How I overlooked your profession, you whore. From the deepest corner of my heart, rather my loins I felt a need to make love to you. The shock of seeing his/her face was too much for my drugged brain. Castrated at birth, an eunuch forced to make a living out of prostitution. However well the makeup might conceal your sex, I  cannot conceal the hurt in my eyes. Fool in the rain, drenched by the sight of those swaying hips. I head back to the bus-stop a little less stoned, a little more hurt and definitely feeling  very foolish. Love at first sight. Always the same. -Santosh-

        Fra, in this open letter, I recount an experience very much like the ones we had in the days of Pushp2.    The architect of this spiral was lali. Introspection leads to guilt which comes from the reliazation that every now and then, I visit a practioner of the oldest profession though for a different reason.    The doobie was canned and hallucinations galore.Sorcerers of madness selling me their time,child of god sitting in the bus, giving peace of mind. Wondering where the bus was leading me, I looked out at the coagulated mass of humanity. "What are they looking at with such wide open eyes?. It was a fellow human. He was lying on the wet,rain-washed cold,roadside, dead. Hit and run! A vast set of responsibilities, aspirations, ambitions, accidently, abruptly....... ended.     Fictional seduction on a black snow sky, sadness killed the superman and no one cried. Warm red blood on a dark black road, the drizzle was diluting the blood stain and dampening the mourning.     The bus driver did not bother to stop and risk being charged for dereliction of duty. I did not bother to ponder and risk being driven to stoned paranoia. --Santosh--

      There are men who are tall, beautiful and slick. Others are good looking, but simple. There are a lot who are devastatingly smart and rich. Then there are also ones who are breathtakingly blasphemous, libertines who are both saints and brutes, poets and seekers. Some Men have long hair and longer haired women.  RKS is all that and more.  This man who once devised the most original babe-tracing algorithm is a Computer Engineer today. Nothing can give me more happiness or serenity. Too much nostalgia... damn!  Even though, it may not be said in the conventional sense (and we don't give a flying fuck for conventions), RKS has been a tr00 Computer Scientist always. From the days, when he devised the most ingenuous babe-tracing algorithm, he frictionlessly slided to yet another path-blazing innovation - The quota scheduling algorithm (QSA)for very complex Blasphemous activities. The QSA, which is un-paralleled in all respects is a unique methodology which has far reaching significance not only in computer science, but a multitude of varied disciples such as Philosophy, Psychology, Mathematics, Humanity etc. It sub-divides various blasphemous activities into various geographical boundaries, taking into account various factors such as epochial-distance maps, proximity of relationships, economics etc.  All this magnificance from a man, who has just freshly turned 24 (Apologies for failing to remember yet again =)  Rks has taught me many things. I would be a fool to even try enumernate them. From the days, when we together harassed women (ofcourse together with Mr. Amit Saini and the satanically rendered Mr. Gaurav Seth), the big man has indeed come a long way. Fidelity has replaced his more colorful amorous activities, scanty tobacco has replaced the hashish and wisdom has replaced the buoyant sexuality. All this infront of my naked, amused eyes ;)  I have thought many times what I want him to become and surprisingly there is only one answer that bounces back immediately - An international don or a playboy. It's such a pity that he isn't going to become either of them, but what the hell, I can daydream ;)  Of all my friends, he is perhaps the only one, I never got mad at or even irritated. Infact, in my mind, he is the most saintly person I have met. But this saint promised me the last time I met him, that he would come to party with me in Philadelphia, the day he graduated.  Now, he has graduated. Rks, I am still waiting for you. And saints are supposed to keep their words ;)

       'He never turns up, the one who kept away when I was dying, when I needed needed him. The one it is all about, Allah Ishvar God. Absent as ever while we writhe and suffer in his name"   My most sincere saalam, Salman.   Cold, dry, isolated server rooms have so habituated me to a life of silent seclusion that I cannot bear the din of early morning hindu prayer rituals. tollin bells, nauseating incense sticks.  What and who is God? What's his sex? They say God puts us through pain to test our faith. Women do the same sometimes.   Does God smoke cannabis?   I saw Jesus cookin at a 'Chinese-food' stall perched on the edge of a gutter. The Bangaladeshi refugees masquerading as Chinese cooks preferred to call his Jaidev. Either Jesus cooks awful Chinese or the hash that I smoked was 'cut; with either ether, moth balls, rat poison or boot polish.  Whatever the reason, whatever the adulterant, I puked under the blue neon glow of a signboard. Were those pieces of my abused lungs that floated in the mess? I looked up and thru the haze I read the signboard. It said,'Detection of Crime Branch,Unit 4, Mumbai Police'!!  I met Mother Mary at Marol pipeline. Her fellow bar-girls preferred tocall her Maria. Carrying the child of a mysterious father in her womb, she was struggling to cross the busy street. I held her arm and helped her across. She looked at me and said, "May God bless you". Which God was she referring to? The same who never turns up? The one who kept away when she sold herself to the rich bloated businessman? or the one who keeps away while she carries her kid all alone? Will she name her son James? I'll prefer to call him Jesus.

      It festers and pouts. Gurgles and gapes. Then, it does all that some more. The realization of the fact that you are wounded, can be like a warm hand cupping your scrotum or the same hand crushing it to agony. The pain blinds and dictates. It gushes through you like the finest honey which flows within when your lips are kissed with truth and love. Filling up every fibre with an elegant subtlety, only paralleled by it's magnanimity.  And then.  Then the honey turns sour.    The eyes are filled with laughter but the soul is drowned in the mire. This duality represents life and perhaps death. I have seen it manifest in all things. In myself. In nature.  She said I am always unhappy. Maybe others classify this duality as unhappiness. Maybe I have never known happiness, so much that I cannot even recognize it. But, I sincerely do not think that it exists. As neither does unhappiness. The whole phenomenon closely resembles a Non-Deterministic Finite automata.     The begining and the end are always the same.  Everything stems from within and ends there.   The state of mind which is a manifestation of superficial/fictional reality is not the true state of mind. There is no description of the other. It is for you and me to fathom. And abide by.   And romance.

      Breakpoints,  ctags and stack pointers.  I use them to debug code.  What can I use to debug my mind ? Things are terribly wrong.  And it's not the short in my bedroom or the maniacal depression which is almost too near to an orgasm. Not even the impossibly pretty waitress who served us drinks at Caesars in Atlantic City (though thats a different story/complication).  I am sure its not my stomach which has turned acrid afters months of abusive american food.  Or my eyes,  once so bright, now sparkling benignly with blight caused by the maleficence of glaring at kinky computer moniters.  Can't possibly be my friends, who are so few that you may think that they are invisible.  Definitely not the fungal love of a pretty woman which (thankfully), I have rarely known.   Why can't you interest me with your wares ?   I can only see the dirtiness of your mouth when you smile.

      &nbsp; Have you ever contemplated suicide? Not just thought about it, but actually, conciously considered committing it? The experience of that moment is just too amazing. That is if you don't go all the way and kill yourself, but stop just short. Just a fraction short.  &nbsp; The proverbial endless tunnel with light at the far end. Well I never saw it. So I won't term&nbsp;mine as a near-death experience. But all the same, it was an eye opener. To climb atop the highest terrace in my vicinity. Climb even higher atop the water tank. Holding on to a rusted t.v. antenna rod and leaning with one foot dangling over the edge, I peer out into the darkness of my town by night. Then I look down to the concrete. Quenched with gallons of water when it was set, it now seems thirsty for my blood.  &nbsp; What would it be like to be free of all obligations? No responsibilities, no aims, aspirations, hopes, desires. What if there was nobody to cry behind me on this earth if I were to smash my brain on the&nbsp;thirsty concrete? If nobody was going to miss me and I wasn't going to miss nobody,&nbsp; would I then have left that hand holding the antenna rod and smiled at the approaching concrete? &nbsp; Responsibilities, obligations, loved ones. They stopped me from suicide.  &nbsp; Responsibilities, obligations, loved ones. Aren't they who drive us to suicide?? --Santosh--

      So, this French classic has me on my knees ever since I laid my eyes on it. This along with copious doses of "GODFLESH - Streetcleaner " lilts into an ambience only the `empty` can embrace. The most elegant taste swirling on your tongue, so ethereal, that you may perhaps forget that it's only a taste and not a state.  And I often wonder, why these profound experiences leave me absolute melancholy sadness. So much, that it has almost become a depraved, sordid addiction. Cocaine is for amateurs, like Celine says. The happier the experiences are, the sadder I become. The more the people surround me, the more lonlier I get. Sometimes, when I am with people, I get so involved in observing their sordidity, that I am almost convinced that I don't exist. Its times like these when I sense the "inhumaness" in me or the lack of any care or regard for anything other than my thoughts. All this hinting at a certain something, which I will decipher someday.

      So what is there in SILENCE, usually at nights, that always makes my heart beat just that little bit faster? It is a strange feeling that I find difficult to express in words (or even normal sentences)! Thinking long and hard, the best I have been able to do is visualize... visualize myself as a palmist as I am peering over the hands of the one destined to slay me... or as a "Sambho" follower (Sambhu is another name for Lord Shiva in Hinduism specially important here for his fondness for smot-poking)  seeing the dying flames of the last joint available ! Do you feel the same???  Looking at is from a scientific standpoint, some amount of sound is necessary to keep a human sane. I always have some sound or the other surrounding me: the mechanical sound of my fan turned on (normally at low speed), the sound of the air (coming out of the fan) as it hits my ear, the crickets chirping outside my window as they mate, the sound of the leaves of the old oak tree whispering... conspiring as the north east blows..... I am not Insane! The night though is insanely beautiful, and as I look out of my window, I again get the same feeling that has been haunting me since eternity.  Is it a punishment for a deed long done or is it the premonition of something to happen? Is the night seeking revenge for what I have given her, or is she just playful tonight?

      The title points to  a link where this admirable question was raised, and this is my humble quest to answer it.  This is a classic question, which resembles the duality omnipresent in every atom of this universe. Much parallel to a question like say - where is the universe situated ?  One way of saying it is that the speed of darkness is the speed at which light dies out (or slows down to death). Or disintegrates  or is dispersed. On careful thought, this can never be a standardized measure because,  light often exhibits ephemeral characteristics, which is (strangely ?)  akin to the fickleness seen in women. At times, light dies the most glorious, lilting death in the form of a  sunset. Other times, it remembles the swiftness of a premature ejacualator, when you switch off an electic light. There can be many abberations of varying magnitude to this behavior. So,  the speed  of  darkness is  equal and opposite to this speed of light's death.  Another way of answering it, which I personally favour, is that one cannot measure the speed of darkness because it never travels. It is simply always present. It is the basic or the natural state of everything. It is the truth.  And we have to bring light in our lives because we don't have the mettle to face the truth.  And like all other chimeras, light is meant to be transient.  We indulge in myriad things to bring light in our lives, trying to escape the darkness within,  momentarily. But, it keeps coming back, because it is a part of our constituency. The day, we learn to embrace this darkness within ourselves will be a day of grotesque realizations and awakenings.

      suddenly, he's back. they're both back. okay, you want to know who i'm talking about? steve colasante... and adam taylor. in full force in my thoughts in my heart the latter which i forgot they both held such a big chunk of in completely opposite ways.  adam was my best friend. steve was someone i never really knew.  steve was my fantasy. adam was my reality although we shared fantasies.  it is hard for me to be straightforward. weighed down by the analogies and flowery words that once set me free; the syllables i danced with, held by delicately manipulated sentence strings.  i wrote so much poetry then. laying on my bedroom floor, much like i'm laying on my living room floor now. it will be gone soon... (but that's another essay altogether).  so back to the matter at hand. steve and adam.  adam, dark and handsome tall and thin every movement graceful. in the deep night i would see nothing but the burning tip of his cigarette punctuating his spoken word; his silouette illuminated by the moon light. i watched and i listened and my heart filled with empathy and a sense of warmth knowing that i was understood too.  steve, light and handsome short and thick the blondest hair the bluest eyes always wide and seemingly full of playful mischief. he was the personification of my dreams an outlet for my creativity. i imagined i could see through him that he could see through me that he saw the tremendous amount of love spilling over my heart needing to be caught, so not lost.  adam was the well in which i fell.  and ever since, i have been climbing.  i am back where i began.  and so are they. at the same time, oddly like handling just one ghost would not have been enough? but part of that is my fault.  my mother hired steve to do some landscaping work on her house so his name is there his presence near. i've begged her not to mention me. i humiliated myself then and don't want to pour salt on a wound that's never fully healed. sure, that's what adolesence is for but i had no shame. that whole experience gave it to me.  not long ago, when i was in pennsylvania last i mustered up the courage to pull into the driveway that at least five years ago belonged to adam's mother. she was at home, alone and told me all about how happy he is. he was married a year and a half ago - in mexico. i was surprised by my own response. i should have been happy but instead i felt a deep, dull pang. i realized later, that what made me most sad was that i was not there to share it with him.  christine gave me his contact information and for a whole day, maybe two i tried calling but both numbers went to voice mail.  i thought the reason why we hadn't spoken in all these years was because i upset him and he was angry with me. mom taylor didn't think that was the case but maybe he doesn't tell her everything; at least not this.  i wondered if he was given some warning and was avoiding me.  and then i kept coming home late at night. too late to call. and then there was a death in the family and that took precedence.  i'm writing now, and it is still early. when i finish, i am going to give it another try. i've thought less about what i want to say to him than what i want to say to steve. it would be easy with steve because really we would be starting at the very beginning. adam and i can't just pick up where we left off so i suppose i will go with the flow. i don't know what tone i'll manage to squeak out "hello" in. his response will determine which way it goes from there. i'm afraid i'll cry.  do I want to tell him about my george michael phase a while back? faith. it's a theme album if you listen hard. really it is. but with all my recent dyings and rebirths, it hit close to home.  back to the intangible expressed in tangible ways.

      Have your felt your ideas, feelings or thoughts dissolve ? Not because they remained unfulfilled.  Though, thats one of the catalysts which leads on to the dissolution I believe.  What I mean is dissolution of these impulses within yourselves, not that you have reined them in. Just naturally. It may perhaps even be the natural course of action for them. Does that make me more of a nihilist ? True, it does makes me realize the lack of inherant value in anything except what it actually seems. But, I never steered myself to percieve it like this. Maybe I am born Nihilist.  The sum total of all the moments I spent with her that day, never made me feel that I won't see her again. Romanticism as opposed to Romance. There is a mammoth difference. Foolishness !?! I din't really get sentimental about it at all. But, I felt all the peace which a zen master can promise when I lifted her pretty mouth to kiss.  I believed in her cognizance when we filled each other. And revelled in it's luxury. Her words put the right balance to my drunken tottering self that night. Perfection can never be over-rated or rather even estimated. But, these are such times whence I must forgive myself for these un-becoming aberrations - when I attempt to encapsulate the ambience in singleton words.  We are but our experiences. Every small one of them adds millimeters to our penises or our brains. The idealism of these thoughts gives me fuel to burn some more. The inspiration she affected in me is a raison d`etre in itself. Her beauty is memorized in my soul. I hail her from within all the significance contained within me.   The dissolution is now consummated.
