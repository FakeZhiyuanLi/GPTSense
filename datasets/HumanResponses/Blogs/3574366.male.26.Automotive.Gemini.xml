      So there I am, sitting in the bar, feeling like a piece of dirt, when in walks my friend River.  Not only did he immediately put me on my knees, but he ended up giving me a wallet when it was all over with.  I know that he's part of this slave market, and I guess he's actually a slave, which confuses me some, but he seems to like me, and helps me out SO much.  So maybe there's hope for me, if he thinks I'm ok to hang out with.  I don't know.  Anyway,I'm so grateful to River for being my friend, and the wallet is so awesome!  I have never been given a gift by another person outside my family.  I should get some sleep.  I need to get some more business cards out tomorrow and talk to the guy at the garage to see if I can lease some space from him.  What a week it's been.

      I have to think about this differently.  I haven't failed at anything, because I haven't been asked to do anything.  So I wrote that stupid note.  Yeah, that was stupid as hell, but was it a failure?  I don't understand all this stuff about me only being good enough to be a toy and nothing else.  Noone even knows me.  And how is he going to point at me and tell that other guy not to be like me, when all I'm doing is sitting there trying to have a cold drink?  And why's Carl so sure that his opinion is so right,and so accurate?  I've spent a total of maybe a half hour with the man in my whole life!  I guess asking for help to know how to behave is being pushy.  Then how will I ever learn anything, if noone is willing to tell me, and asking is not what I'm supposed to do?  All I get is these tags, pushy, manipulative, a toy.  And a liar?  I don't get it, I really don't.  But I have to think of it some other way.  I'm not a failure.  I've never been given a chance.  I'm not going to worry about this marketplace stuff.  If that's how it works, that someone is so easily labeled as useless, then I'll find another path.  There's someone out there who wants someone like me.  I know that.  I'll find him.  Or he'll find me.  I'm just going to be myself.

      Everywhere I go, I run into Foster's opinion of me, which is that I'm simply a toy, a failure, a thing NOT to be. Maybe I'm not supposed to be here.  Maybe I'll see what Carl wants.  He's a sexy motherfucker.  Maybe I'll just split.  Very unfriendly territory.... Tony

      I finally found a bit of work today!  Ran into River at the market, and his employer's limosine was running sluggish, so I went over and tuned it up, and that fixed it right up.  It's a fine car, the limo.  I love working on them, because there's so much room under the hood.  It was also nice to be around River again.  If only my cock would behave!  It felt good to be covered in grease and sweat again.  Reminds me of home, when we'd work on cars all day, then clean up and go riding around at night, looking for trouble.  If I can get some more customers to work for in the daytime, I can get rid of the night job and focus more on mechanic work, and, well, spend more time helping people out who might recognize my skills as something...marketable...

      Not doing very well at this Atkins stuff.  I had plans to cut the carbs out, but it just seems so unnatural to eat a meal without rice or bread.  Or potatoes.  Oh well, no real big reason to be committed to it, the jogging and workouts keep me slim and fit.  If I could just find more work in the daytime, I'd really not have to worry about it at all.    Sissy seems really nice.  I've run into him the past few days in the market.  I wonder what role he has in the slave market.  I wonder if he could help me get in, or if he would.  Everyone else seems mostly disgusted with me, and I can't blame them.  I'm sure I seem like a dumb kid to them, constantly making a fool of myself.  Maybe I can learn more about it at the next event, the spotters presentation.  I'll have to leave early, but maybe I can learn enough at the first part of it to actually go somewhere with it.  I'm trying really hard to be patient.  Hell, if I'm not patient, look what I end up doing: writing stupid notes to important people.  Best to just wait and see.  I guess if I never get in, it wasn't meant to be.  But I wonder what some other things are that I can learn, to give me a boost.  I can clean anything, spotlessly, mom taught me that.  I can cook a decent meal.  I can fix just about anything in a house, and I clean up nicely.  Maybe I could see about a manners school or something like that.  Wonder how much that would cost....

      Last night was amazing.  I don't know what I expected, but I didn't expect to hear such logical and  organized thoughts.  I didn't expect them to make such perfect sense.  It was just stunning, seeing the trainers up close, hearing their ideas, learning their expectations.  It's less of a dream to me now, and more of a reality.  It's something I want to do more than ever, to learn from one of them, to train to become property and part of this world.  I still remember one thing the russian woman liked to see in potential slaves: that the slave had accomplished something.  I don't think I've accomplished anything of importance.  I got my diploma, but big deal.  I got my mechanic's certificate, but that's not such a big thing either.  What have I done?  I can't think of a thing.  Maybe this will be my first big accomplishment, to become a potential slave that one of the trainers will want to work with.  I met a guy named Carl last night, and we really seemed to click.  He reminded me a little of Brendan.  And he made my dick hard.  But I wonder what Foster meant when he said he'd be watching to see who I hang out with.  I hope I don't make any mistakes.  I'm not sure what to do.  I guess I will just be myself.  I can't get in trouble for doing something I'm not told not to do.  Can I?

      Ran into Dylan today.  It was great to see him.  I always felt comfortable around him, because he never expected me to know things I didn't know.  He's a really laid back person.  I was surprised to find out that he had "joined them," but didn't feel it was my place to ask him what kind of position he held.  I'm curious, though.  He seemed very optimistic when hearing that I'd spoken with Foster about wanting to be involved in this slave thing.  Made me feel better.  Met some new people today, too.  Ricky and Savannah seemed very nice.  The ones in the Bistro earlier were strange though, negotiating a deal with a prostitute right out in the open.  It was embarrassing and I had to leave.  I ran my 5 miles today.  God, it's hot out there.  I never thought it could be this hot here.  But now I should go shower and get ready for the presentation tonight.  It will be the first real information that I'll hear, and my curiosity is burning me up!  I can't wait.  More later.

      Once again, I start over.  I'm back in the city where I was about a year ago, trying to find the exact thing I freaked out about last time I was here.  I remember when I first realized that a slave ring actually existed.  My reaction to it was so violent and sudden.  It's obvious to me now that that was because it was what I wanted, but I rebelled out of fear of ...  I don't know, failure?  I'm not so sure why I was so scared and offended by the idea.    I think about when I was here last, about how I was such an idiot around Foster, about how well Brendan treated me and how safe I felt when he was around.  I'm almost sad that Brendan is not part of this slave ring thing.  When I saw him the other day, he was pretty cold, I guess, compared to the last time I saw him, but I guess I can't blame him.  We were starting to get close, and I just split.  I hope I can make it up to him, to let him know, somehow, that I appreciated his kindness to me, so much, and that I won't take off like an idiot with some master who's just going to ditch me later and leave me with no idea what I did wrong.  I miss Reagenae.  I wish I could see her and talk to her.  Maybe she could help me get a grip on what's really going on around here, and help me figure out how to get in.  I worry so much about that stupid letter I wrote to Vivian.  What the hell was I thinking?  "I know something about you.  Please contact me."  What the HELL was I thinking?  That I'd somehow just confront her with the idea that I knew she was in the slave business and that would just get me right in the door?  Jesus, I'm such an idiot when I don't know what to do.  I'm sure she thinks I'm some pushy little brat, just like Foster does.  What a mess.  But ...  my heart won't be still and waves of something crazy magic rush through my body every time Foster is near.  He seems to like me, despite himself.  Or maybe it's just business?  Oh my god, if he's interested in helping me get in, what will I ever do to thank him?  I get dizzy thinking about it.    All these beautiful strong people make me giddy.  To imagine being trained and displayed and sold sends me daydreaming for hours.  I know it would be a lot of hard work, and I know I'll have to work extra hard on my focus, but the thought of being owned, being part of a system of owners and trainers, such security, is just unpeered in my life.  I've never wanted anything more.  But I'll be patient.  I'll find some cars and things to work on, and try to just make myself useful and see if anyone thinks I'm worth anything.  I'm lucky to have a friend like River to talk to.  He's younger than I am, but much wiser.  He's one of those people who think a lot.  I'm rambling, but I think it's good to just get it all out on paper.  It helps to make things firmer in my mind.  I hope that it will get better, that my thoughts will become more clear, or that I'll at least be able to communicate them better to other people.  I have such a hard time trying to find the right words to say.
