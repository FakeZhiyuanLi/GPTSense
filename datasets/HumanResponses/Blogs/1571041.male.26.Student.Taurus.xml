      Thursday is now here?  So what... I'm still sore from that ole pack test taken oh so many couple days ago.  Well, not really that, it's just that I tried playing some ball last night, and I was sore then, but then got into the groove and started running around like I was alright.  Woke up early as all heck this morning and found that being alright is far from the case w/ me.  My traps ( muscle between shoulders and neck)  hurt all good, and the legs, dang the legs are nice and sore like I just took that pack test again?  It's going to be a  loooooong  day for me.  The big thing today is those refresher things for fire fighting that goes on all day today.  Yesterday I turned in that physical stuff, but what do you know, they only wanted a copy of  one thing , but the packet they gave me was like  6  pages?   What's the rest for, looks ?  But, after all this running here and there, and the physical challenges now over w/, I'll finally be able to say, " yup, I'm on the ole waiting list now. "  Meaning:   I'm almost an official Emergency Fire Fighter .  I want to take my li'l nephew  Ray  to Spring Canyon today, but not sure if he's around here, or where he's @?  Actually, kinda wondering where he's staying since school is out?  He used to actually call up the house, " uncle, can I come over ?" and I was just too busy to spend time w/ li'l man.  Maybe I'm just feeling bad for brushing him off, but still, I want to spend time w/ him.  I  do not  really  like  the  heat , or the  sand , or the  people around , but I'm willing to bet if you show him the water, he's good to go no matter what.  Oh, and I lifted yesterday.   Bench  =  15 reps @ 135; 10 reps @ 225; 4 reps @ 295; 1 rep @ 315; & 9 reps @ 255 .  Then, did some curls to finish my oh so busy day of lifting.  While leaving the community center though, saw my uncle  Clifford .  He's cool and all, but it saddens me to see him getting so small and frail.  Growing up he was the constant joker and kinda livened things up, but now though, he has years on his face and a look of worry in his eyes.  Maybe it's just me, but that's what I see whenever I get a chance meeting w/ him.  Even so, much respect is due to that man, so I do what I can for him.

      Well, today started out all kinds of early (5:00 a.m.) and I got a major thing out of the way, the pack test to be a emergency fire fighter (eff) which consists of walking 3 miles within 45 minutes, but that's not enough see, because it is done w/ 45 lbs to help weigh you down.  Just a li'l bit hard, but only if you are not really in shape, which I am not.  Dang, I started out pretty good, averaging about 6 minutes every half mile for the first half of the 3 mile hike.  Instead, I ended up just under 40 minutes for the final time.  Pretty good though, because the last time I did it, summer of 2001, I barely made it within the allotted time given.  Didn't know what to expect, or how to do the thing, just showed up and tried it out.  Now, I gotta go and get my physical faxed over to mt. tolman so I can officially be put on the list, when they start forming crews for firefighting.  Man, is that going to be a relief, getting some quick income.  I still need boots though, and those run a good 100 - 150 dollars for a basic pair.  Oh, and then you can throw in the extra pair of shoe strings, and some oil too, not to mention your socks as well.  Altogether, I'd say the price of that alone might run you close to 175 - 200 bucks.  OH Man, my shoulders are sore, my calves are sore, my ankles are feeling it, and even my neck seems to be begging for relief.  More than likely, I'm looking at some cramping today if I don't actually get some water, or some form of liquids in my system throughout the day.  I already chomped up 2 bannannas and even downed a multivitamin ( not knowing if it'll help, but what the heck ).  I figure I'd like to rest, but am afraid to wake up grabbing my leg from aching and cramping.  Well, other than that, not much is going on here on the ole colville rez.

      Man, when you think things are alright, something has to happen that shows you how wrong you can be.  The aunt who had a heart attack ended up passing on.  Tonight is the wake, and tomorrow is the funeral.  Sucks that these funerals are coming in a flurry this past month or so.  Well, today woke up all nice and late.  But, got to holla @ Mario once again, but it was to try and get ahold of ole Troy.  Well, didn't happen.  So, I call up Mrs. Adams.  We talk around for awhile and she's got her drama going on.  Not only that, but everyone else has their things going on w/ them too.  Maybe if I was still @ SIPI, things might not be how they are, or maybe they might be worse.  Anyways, things are how they are both @ SIPI, and here @ home:  nice and drama filled.  I decided that I won't even touch, or work on the NHH site for awhile now.  I'm most likely looking at either July or maybe even August to get things going again.  So much has happened, and is going on that I don't have the time to be reworking the layout anymore.  Sucks, but life happens.  Last night was a long night, or I should say early this morning.  It just so happens that my nephew was heading back over to the coast, and my cousin drove a li'l over half way to meet him.  So what happens?  I'm the chauffer that is volunteered to bring li'l man over yonder.  Well, I had nothing better to do, other than wonder what else is going on, and check out ole Direct TV for the rest of the time I'm awake.  Well, I take off around 1:45 a.m. and get there around 3 a.m.  The drive was pretty uneventful since ole boy was sleeping the whole way.  Maybe for the better though, because I didn't mind the time to check out the new cd's I made.  Then, on the way back, stop by ole Wal Mart, and hooked up them gars.  Black N Mild of course.  Got home, lifted weights, and went to bed around 10:00 a.m.  My bro is supposed to be coming around for the funeral, and probably soon, so I'm gonna cut this short and get ready.

      Now, it's all kinds of early in the morning here.  I haven't really gotten much sleep, but it was pretty worth the tiredness I'm going through now.  Yesterday was all sorts of productive.  I got to go out to spokane, and visit my pro mylan in spokane county jail.  It was surprising to him, but we didn't show much to each other, other than the occassional laugh or smile.  Had to bring some bad news to him though, because our aunt had a pretty harsh heart attack, and she lost memory of who people are.  I also did inform him of a possible interview hook up that might happen, but will have to wait and see on that.  That took place in the afternoon.  Later on, I go to the mall and pay my cell bill for the 1st time in awhile.  Sadly, checked my messages and there weren't any.  After having some overpriced mall food, walked around to kill time while they were getting my phone up to 'connected again' status.  I know it was worth it when I was in school, but now that I'm back home, paying 85 dollars a month for a phone I'm hardly using does not seem very economical to my financial status of being a li'l bit on the broke side.  Well, after the phone got hooked back up, I called up some folks from school.  I got to holla @ Grant, Tanya, Mario, and Russ.  All these conversations were going on and I was supposed to be having dinner w/ my brother.  I think that was rude, but damnit, I just got my phone turned back on for the first time in a long time.  So, I'm still on the phone and my bro heads home.  After talking my battery to near death, I decide I better get some petro.  That's cool, but I have a chord to plug in the lighter, but the lighter fuse goes out?  The temp solution, switch fuses w/ the rear window defogger.  It works, then I switch back.  After that happens, I'm almost on my way back home when I decide to hit up Trav.  We get to talking and he's asking me to roll through and check the spot.  Being the unexcited person I was @ the time, I up and decide, "why not?"  Well, it ended up being a small gathering, and for a lot of the time, it was basically me, trav, and ryan outside.  To kill time, trav and I were freestyling around trying to come up w/ hooks, or inspiration for some lyrics.  Basically though, we were kinda running off at the mouth, and bs'ing for no real reasons.  Went home, went to bed, and called it a day only to start another one after it was all over, almost...

      Where does today bring me?  I don't know.  I was supposed to be working on updating the NHH site, but don't know when that's actually going to happen.  I started up this blog thingy a couple minutes ago, and am trying out this stuff for the first time.  Right now though, I hate misquitos because I'm allergic to them.  I get bit, and where they bit swells up all kinds.  It look like it hurts pretty good, but doesn't.  It's hot here, and I'm up @ 2 in the morning writing this stuff.  Tried calling Howie yesterday, but that didn't quite work out?  I know he tried calling here, but I was sleeping again.  Trav hasn't been around, and that's not very odd considering his situation these days.  If anything else happens today, I'll write more, but for now, I'm cutting it short.  Gotta get to at least attempting to rework the site every now and then.

      Well, what can I think to write about now?  How bout these holidays?  I got something to say about them, I'm guessing.  Well, most recently there was this thing called "halloween" that went on.  This is MY holiday, because I like trying to decorate the porch for the trick or treaters from around town.  I don't decorate the entire house, just the porch because that's all they see anyway.  But anyways, It's a basic set up of some black lights, a strobe light if available, and some other decorative touches that may come to mind like spider webbing, black light reflective stuff, and stuff of that nature.  Well, this year (2003) it just so happens I'm not home to do this.  Last year (2002) I was @ SIPI and was homesick all kinds around this time of year.  Not around thanksgiving, but halloween is when I was most homesick?  Now, Thanksgiving, that's pretty dumb.  I've touched on this before on the native hip hop site.  But, Thanksgiving is a stupid holiday that I don't really get into.  Our family is so scattered these days that a gathering of it requires setting something up so far in advance it's crazy.  We used to just do it on a whim, or a mutual agreeing, but lately everyone has other plans and that's cool.  We just usually have some turkey, cranberries, pie, stuffing, and mashed potatoes.  If I'm not satisfied, I just cruise around to other places and dip my appetite in what they may still have around.  The cool thing is that I may not be invited to their gatherings, but am still welcomed to show up if I can.  Christmas:  again, we don't really get into it.  There's no decorations, no christmas tree, no candles, no carolling, just a spot on the ground to put the presents, if there are any.  Usually there's a couple, but for me, there aren't many, if any.  I'm not big on that though.  I usually am not financially fit to buy things for folks either, so it's like I get what I give.  Most of the time, I can only offer a smile and a hug.  Sometimes, that's all some people need?  Or, I'm just saying that to make myself feel better for the lack of material offerings I have to give.  Columbus day: what a joke!  Native American Day:  Seems like an excuse to take a day off to me, that is, for tribal employees.  Veterans Day:  This has some significance for me now.  Before though, I didn't understand things like I do now.  It's not the numerous movies available, or the history lessons I've long forgotten that gives this day significance.  No, it's actually the craziness on the rez that gives this day some umph for me.  We lose people, and sometimes it's through gunplay, but most of the time it's through car wrecks, drug overdose, suicide, and aftereffects of long time drinking and drugs in old ages.  We go through losing our friends and family like soldiers do.  We sometimes see it first hand too.  Some people are diagnosed w/ post traumatic war syndrome and have never been in war before, but it's from growing up in the craziness that is rampant on the rez.  Some kids (That's right, KIDS!) are starting to drink to forget losing loved ones, or even so they won't have to raise their syblings because the parents are heavy into drugs, alcohol or both.  We go through some of the same things the vets went through in war, seeing our friends and family die, going w/out food for a long time, sleep deprevation, mental and physical fatigue, and also the bond of absolute trust that comes from going through the harshest of events w/ someone who was there w/ you.  This is why I look at veterans day and think it is such a worthy holiday to recognize.

      Here I am, in  November  trying to think about  what the heck is going on here .  I got school to try and reintroduce into my plans, as well as trying to save any type of ends.  I will say this though, my cd collection has bounced back w/ a vengeance and the dvds are looking lovely.  By looking lovely, I mean that the collection has some nice #'s to be counted.  Well, to say the least, I owe someone a promise that I will buy  some   clothes  for myself instead of investing  so much  financial  irresponsibility    into  cd's  and  dvd's  like I have been doing since having this ole job @ Mt. Tolman.  Well, I also offered other things, but that's between that person and myself.  But anyways, I'm here on the rez, and things got complicated with  some people .  I don't know what's going on, but more than likely things are looking like they're soured,  for now .  That sucks, but so is life and I'll have to make due w/ what's thrown my way, even if I'm  not really agreeing  w/ the scenarios at hand.  I don't know why I brought that up?  Shoot, it's been a whole 5 months now since I've even touched this li'l blog thing!  I was thinking that I should scrap this thing, but it's nice to look back on past thoughts, and see if they still held true, or just got lost in the wind.  I don't really know how things held up, but know that in those 5 months a lot has happened to me as a person, not so much events.  I'm more looking forward to getting this school stuff started up again and I can just go for what I want to go for.  I've been here @ the rez, and things just didn't work out to really benefit my plans for the future.  It's been an experience where I'm that much more focused though.  Anyways, we're doing more W.U.I. work lately, got done burning piles in snow, and prescribed burns on the rez.  Looks like we're going to get laid off sometime soon, so it's a matter of weeks until we get our last day on for the year.  Well, I'm not knowing where things go from here, but until then, I'll leave it at that...

      Yesterday the saw day took place.  It was really uneventful aside from playing a li'l more basketball again.  But, it was a lot of watching videos that really struggled to hold anyone's attention, at all.  We watched a couple w/ some interest, but after a couple more, attention was turned to other areas, like sleep.  So many heads were nodding around, even the instructor's was struggling to keep an upright position.  But, all in all, it wasn't so bad.  I talked to the rez hogs and also trav from the lost tribe.  i'm trying to get them both to hook up for a show in about 3 or so weeks on the rez.  If things work out, it should be a nice show.  We'll see what happens there.  Then there was today, the 2nd day of saw classes where we actually get to down a tree.  Well, that was the initial plan anyways.  It didn't quite work out that way, but oh wells, it all pays the same.  About 10 or more people weren't able to cut a tree today, and that was fine w/ us.  But, we had lightening strikes all over the rez so we cut things off early and staged somewhere.  Well, before I get into that, let me mention that I got to talk to my cousin this past week that I've been working.  It just so happened he was taking the same classes.  That meant we got to catch up, and exchange some stories about what's been going on w/ us.  Today though, it was an all day event.  We mostly joked around, but also got into music, and wondering why people do some of the things they do?  It was just nice to be able to sit down w/ him and talk about anything and everything.  Okay, we staged after class.  It wasn't so bad, got to kick it w/ pumper folks.  These guls were really giving it the 3rd degree to ole gul on our crew.  I think she might have cried too?  Like it wasn't supposed to happen or something?  What's the old addage?  "What goes around, comes around."  That's what happened to her today.  She looks for confrontation, and got it in full swing today.  One white gul and one native gul put her in her spot.  Usually she's so quick to answer w/ something that either doesn't make sense, or has no truthful basis.  For these two though, she was literally speechless, which was actually surprising?  So, needless to say, she outcasted herself from everyone, trying to gain some type of response other than laughter.  That was staging mostly.  Then, we get called out on a fire.  Nothing really big, we know that, but we also know that no matter what, we're in for a hike.  I'm thinking, this is going to suck, swallow, and gargle.  I hate being right.  This was uphill, sidehill, a li'l downhill, then steep uphill.  Not only that, but it's for a small fire.  Yet, this fire has the potential of blowing up since it's been pretty hot and dry this past week.  It rained today, but I'm not sure it helped too much?  So we're going at this thing without a map.  We thought we got directions to this, but it was to the wrong spot.  So, we made a wrong turn, and was going in the wrong direction.  After we find out where to go, in kick the afterburners.  We're trying out excessive speed down a dirt road.  Not bad, except for the dips, ruts, and debris on the road.  If that wasn't bad enough, let's also throw in narrow.  The truck almost tips over, so I'm thinking, this is going to hurt, because we had 6 people in there, and I'm not necessarily the little guy of the bunch.  We didn't though, so that actually worked out in our favor.  Then we find out where we go, and have to hike to.  One hill done, I'm thinking the worst if over, but had to find out how wrong I really was.  We get there, do our thing and call it cool.  But, now we have to hike back down.  Let me add this for those reading, I hate going downhill.  I'd much rather we go uphill.  You don't turn, or roll your ankle going uphill, you do it downhill.  So, I manage the first ridge thingy or hill and have to keep my clumsy streak alive and fall at the bottom of it.  I was more mad that I had a whole hill that was pretty steep and difficult to fall on, but no, I'd rather do it at the bottom.  Then the sidehill comes and oh, let me just roll my ankle slightly and make this trip back to the truck interesting.  It hurt, but not enough to stop and doctor it up.  I was going right after that happened.  It was sundown by the time we got back to the rig, and I happen to notice the excessive sweat I managed to create on myself.  My entire front chest and stomache is drenched.  As is my back.  So, tomorrow, we're most likely looking at going back to that spot.  I know I'll hate it, I know I'll be sore, but I also know we gotta do it regardless.  So, I'm going to try out some sleep, pack some water, and hope I don't cramp up tonight, or tomorrow.

      I took last Friday, and yesterday off to try and go to Hinkley Pow Wow, but that trip didn't really work out as planned?  But, since I had those days cleared to use as days off, I went w/ the flow and stayed away from work.  Nothing really mentionable yesterday, aside from the everpresent heat that was unexpected.  It reached 90+ Degree Fahrenheit yesterday, and today too.  Okay, so I get back and find the last call back person has arrived.  This kid is cool as all heck.   Part Mexican and white I think?   He's just crazy to be around though.  We joke around a lot, and he meshes w/ the other workers too.  We fell back into our old ways of joking around nonchalantly, and laughing at our own immaturity.  He's going to school out in Seattle, and I also met the newest new guy on the crew who goes to school out in South Dakota somewhere?  We were supposed to do physical training this morning, but we had a class on working w/ pumps, both on and off trucks.  I think the one off rig is a mark (or Mach?) 3 pump?  I thought this was going to be dry and uneventful, but instead it ended up being pretty informative and interesting.  We did more hands on training instead of reading from a book or pamphlet while watching some outdated videos.  To top it off, out in the field we tried out a hose lay and stuff.  That was fine and all, but the instructor sabotaged some of the equipment.  So, we had to figure out what was wrong, fix it, and do what we were asked to do.  These types of things do happen out on the fireline what the instructor did to us, so it was interesting to see what happened.  Needless to say, we got through it all and got some praise for not losing our heads and not complaining out things.  Probably though, because we weren't aware these were purposely done.  After that, we all go on lunch.  I shoot a couple shots in the gym ( because this class was in the community center of that town ) and find the wonderment I was searching for all the time I was not trying to stay awake from monotone speeches about what is and isn't important for pumps,  the weight room .  Nothing spectacular, just an outdated weight set that has stacks of weights for bench, shoulder presses, and leg presses with some bars places for chin ups and dips.  But, there was a pull down machine, a bench, a curl bar, and some dumbbells.  I tried out the bench, first thing of course.  No warm ups at all, just straight 3 plates ( 315 ).  I managed one rep there, w/ very noticeable pain to accompany that effort on my part.  So, I go to pull downs, working the triceps.  No real pain there, but I notice the lack of work put on my big ole stomach and abs.  I'm kinda ashamed about the look I've developed, so I'm trying to get motivated to work on that part of my body sometime,  hopefully soon .  Then, I do some curls w/ the curl bar.  Nice, but could use more work.  I move to dips, and find I can still do those, w/ li'l notice of pain from my shoulder.  I try out  295  on bench, and manage 2 reps this time.  Again,  more pain , so I decide to leave the bench alone from that point on.  I do random sets of random reps for bicep curls, pull downs and dips from that point on.  I manage to call it a workout a couple minutes before class resumes.  When the class ends, we're all feeling alright, and we have about 2 hours of empty time.  Everyone lounges around, milking the clock for all it's worth.  I get to talking w/ the college folks.  We laugh about classes, money, and locations of schools.  Mostly I was cracking jokes about where I went,  SIPI , and they laughed more about things they've done at school.  It was odd though, talking to  a white guy, and a Mexican guy  about  college   without defending anything about where I went .  We know it's tough going through classes, tests, teacher's teaching styles, and trying to come up w/ some finances on our own to do things we want to do.  But, also, I was reading off some pamphlet about  "alcoholism, a treatable disease,"  or something to that effect?  A couple guys on crew, and a lot of those we all knew fit some descriptions in that pamphlet.  We laughed at that, but I wonder why it was so easy to do so, even though it is such a serious issue?  From there, though, the conversation took all different turns and twists, and we all forgot about school.  Did manage to notice that there are a lot of sioux natives on this ole colville rez.  A couple of them even live on the same street in town, but have never met each other?  I thought this was odd, but figure it's just a random set of events that will be corrected sometime down the road.  Tired though now, and might even go to sleep early tonight.  Yeah... Right...

      I look back on things going on, and don't realize how  significant  they really are.  I mean, yeah, I am doing the whole higher education beyond high school thing, but I am starting to see the  actual support  going on all around about that.  People I haven't seen in a  long time  have been asking how school was going for me.  I mean there are some folks that I haven't seen in   Years  , but they know what a native is doing.  I guess word gets around no matter what.  Also, I see that people are unique, but similar too.  Yeah, there are folks  laid back and helpful , but they also get  stressed  from time to time.  The release sometimes comes in a not so agreeable way, but is still a release.  I'm just trying to say they get  heated and moody  at times too.  This, I totally understand, but for them it's so out of character, they really feel bad about it.  They may regret getting aggressive and saying things totally unexpected, but I know already not to take it personal.  I try to express that to others around that are confused to the whole thing.  This part of the post just comes from recent events that reappeared lately.  Nothing really special, but still mentionable.  As for work though... I have to say the majority of it is still the same.  A lot of the old faces there, but also some new ones coming in.  They actually work out too.  The only lagging spots we have are from  previous hirees of last year .  I mean, it's soooooo bad some of these folks.  This one guy is like a  hypochondriac  when it comes to actually having to work.  He's managed to burn his hand so bad he wanted light duty for 2 weeks.  I mean,  this guy requested that ?  But, too bad for him, he was on a  10 day suspension  for something else, and wasted an excuse.  It's pretty strange though, but when he comes back to work, there are  no apparent scars  at all?  This one gul, she's so weird in her own way.  Her thing is to spark a heated argument, or maybe even try to strike out so she won't have to work.  That's so dumb, and dare I say,  Childish ?  Another guy wants to be a know it all and super sawyer, but actually is more of a threat through his lack of physical training and actual lack of knowledge.  These people are actual liabilities to us, but when we mention it, or even complain about them, we're looked at as the bad guys?  Oh wells, that's the way the ball bounces, so I just try to keep an eye on them so as to not get hurt on their account.  So, where to go now?  Oh, I just bought the first season of  Kids In The Hall  on dvd, along w/,  Tupac - Resurrection  too.  Then, I tried out Xzibit's crew's dvd,  Strong Arm Steady .  Most folks don't even know about the Kids In The Hall though, so when I bought it, the lady ringing me up was actually surprised.  That first season is from 89-90.  I was a young buck back then, but still remember who they were.  Went in the studio the other day and dropped half a verse along w/ tray.  It was for the  Rez Hogs  coming from the Yakama Rez.  The beat the rez hogs did was pretty good.  Trav actuall dropped 2 half verses so, it seems long enough for one full verse.  Mine was pretty short, but hopefully still memorable.  Tuke ( the other part of  Tha Lost Tribe  ) was someone I planned on getting on there too, but it ended up being just tray and me who got down.  Tray said the stuff we did for them ( rez hogs ) we should have kept for something on their ( tha lost tribe's ) album, but that's alright, we'll still do what we do.  At least they're getting a quality contribution on our part.  At least I'd like to think that.  Oh wells, we'll see how things shape up when those Yakama's tell us the verdict.  They're (rez hogs) are supposed to come around here for  urlLink HoopFest  next weekend, but I'm most likely going to be working.  If I get a chance though, I want to work more on the whole rapping thing.  I'm not apart of either group, but am actually like a mediator for them, because that's how they actually hooked up, was through me.  It's cool though, that they are working together.  I like both groups, and know they'll be making noise down the road.

      Well, I don't know what the heck happened here.  I got way off track.  That's alright though, because if you didn't know, life happens.  Okay, I got a lot to go off on now.  Where do I start?  Oh, I went back to  urlLink sipi  for the spring trimester of '04.  I was expecting friends to be there, and supportive, and well, friends.  Yet, I show up, and things are so different.  They got jobs, they're apart of student senate, they're hooked up, and I guess what I'm trying to get at,  they're all growing up .  I felt a little lost there.  It wasn't anywhere near the same as when I last left.  I did meet some brothers though that are just crazy as all heck.  I don't think they mean to be, but that makes them even more dynamic.  Most of the time, I hung out w/ these two guys.  I also found out that my li'l intro to psychology class wasn't very much of a challenge?  I don't know what it was, but there was  li'l to no effort  on my part, but I  still manage to ace that class ?  I was actually proud though, because if that was so easy, then why did I  struggle  to even pass my other classes?  I know though, it's because I  expected  to  walk through  those ones and get the same results,  an easy A .  But, I did manage to pass the ole precalculas class somehow.  I also found out that even though I  HATE  speaking in front of a # of people, I still manage to project strongly when doing so.  It's so nerveracking though, but I think I could have managed to do better had I done it the required # of times expected of us.  I did some speeches here and there, but I kept thinking I wouldn't pass that class.  The teacher though, really like my presence?  He honestly shook my hand and sincerely thanked me for speaking?  It's weird, I'm so used to trying to stay two steps ahead of things that I always expect to be disciplined somehow instead of complimented.  So, when a teacher asks to speak to me privately I automatically start getting rigid and defensive.  That being said, I was thrown an  absolute curve ,  or change up , when I was complimented for what I've been doing in class.  I kept thinking though,  they just want me to ease up, then drop the hammer on me .  Too many years of being talked down to and abused psychologically back home I guess?  Needless to say, I was kinda tongue tied and had no clue on how to react.  I guess shock was predominantly visible, and even some nervousness.  But, I thanked them and went on my way.  But aside from that though, SIPI ended up being an alright experience for me.  I am always used to things  just staying how they were , and found out things, people, and places do actually  evolve  and  move on .  I guess it's a part of life I never quite got to experience here on the rez.  The only changes seem to be when things go from bad to worse.  Oh, and I totally blew up on weights.  Last time I was @ SIPI, I was maxing about 315 on bench press.  A very respectable weight no doubt.  But, this last time, I don't know what it was, but I worked up to doing 355.  In doing so though, I think I hurt my shoulder.  I actually try to keep lifting, even though my shoulder still hurts even 3 months later, and try to persue my goal of becoming a monster.  I don't think I'm there yet, but others would tend to disagree.  Then, something I don't know if it ever made it's way to it's mark, but I wrote a long email to a teacher I  absolutely  respected from my high school days.  It actually commended them for showing any type of positive reinforcement to a kid that never really got the benefit of the doubt for amounting to anything.  Yet, I was quiet and shy about things then and didn't say much to express the impact they had on me.  I did so down in SIPI, and never did get a reply?  So, I'm left to wonder if what I sent off even got read, or even mattered to them?

      So I'm just lounging around, trying to scheme my way into going to Post Falls' Pow Wow.  Well, as it turns out, there was no scheming needed this year.  And, unlike last year, this year I was fortunate not to fall asleep @ the wheel and wreck.  Okay, let's try and recap this wow...  Friday, I had work, but planned on going to the wow anyways.  This has been something I've been looking forward to for awhile now.  Even though I did in fact  wreck last year,  I still look forward to attending this event every year.  One year I missed it because of school, and possibly next year I'll miss it too, but while I can, I'm still going to try and attend.  Anyways, I get off work, and start to pack up clothes and whatnot.  I finally manage to get things together and try to begin the ole journey ahead of me.  Yet, when I just start reversing into the street, I manage to see a couple homeys (  Duke & Lou  ).  As it happens, I finally cashed my check in that day, even though it was given the week prior.  So, I offer to take them along.  They look at each other, then to me, and ask, " you serious ?"  Like I've ever joked around about  taking a road trip ?  But, it just so happens that they aren't anywhere near ready to head out, so we head out 15 miles up north so they can pretty up and get packed.  It took a lot of time away from my getting out there, but in the end it was all worth it.  Now, we're rolling 3 deep to the spot.  One guy, Lou, makes some calls to see how things are shaping up.  It was massive from the sounds of it, as in over 500 dancers and a crowd in the thousands.  Sounds reasonable enough to me, and that's why I always look forward to this place @ this time.  There are natives scattered from one end of the dog track to the other end.  Then you have the natives just waiting for the nine too.  I happened to be driving a couple of these natives around, and needless to say, I think I also joined these ranks too.  But, we're teasing Lou about being the one who usually loses his ID as we pull up the the after wow spot, The Graille.  We get our smell good on and what 'good' clothes we had packed.  We stroll, or some might even say 'strut' to the entrance and right as we get to the doorway, I just happened to notice I didn't happen to have any Identification on me.  An old SIPI ID was in my wallet, a Safeway card, Replay Card, Best buy Card, GNC card, and a Barns & Noble Card.  All these things I'm carrying, even a grip of money, but alas, no ID.  Fortunately though, the homeys are on some all for one and one for all stuff and actually stay w/ me?  Surprising to me.  So, we just lounge around --  parking lot pimping it .  We joke around, waiting for   Trav   to come out, as he's the one who asked us to bring our presence there.  He said it was pretty weak though, so no worries, and not only that, but Lou and Duke managed to save  $  by not buying drinks and beers.  After Hours... not so hot.  Not very many attendants.  But, there was a small bit of drama involving me.  This guy comes around trying to be the life of the party and says something to which I blurt out, " Don't Worry About It ."  It wasn't meant to disrespect, but just a way of poking fun.  No luck though, as he's intoxicated and feeling like he can run things.  He looks @ me and assumes I'm an ex-con.  Starts rambling about, " Oh, he thinks he's the only one here who's done time.  He thinks he's the only convict here ."  To which he's taking off his shirt while saying these things.  This guy looks like he can definitely hold his own in any situation, but he's stepping up to me off an innocent comment?  I didn't have any aggression in me, even as he's trying to call me out.  Instead I laugh and look @ him, waiting for a move to be made instead of all talk.  He tries to chest up, and tries to  TELL  me to shake his hand.  I just told him, " I don't gotta do anything. "  Not yelling, not trying to make any sudden moves, not even trying to mean mug, but just talking in a normal tone.  He's pissed because he's not getting his just dues?  No one is bowing down to him?  So, he talks more and more, and I just let him know, " Do what you do.  I ain't hating ."  But, being that he's intoxicated all kinds, I have to repeat myself over and over.  It does finally end up that we do shake hands and things calm down.  He didn't know though, that Lou had already sized him up, and was just waiting for a move to be made so he can start dumping.  Not only that, I had a couple other folks just waiting too.  He had one other guy w/ him, and that wasn't going to help him @ all.  That was Friday night...  Saturday comes along and as it turns out, I get into the Studio w/ Trav to hop on the final track for their full length album that's yet to be titled.  I had this poem memorized from when I went to  Crow Agency  to try and put it down on a   Supaman   Beat.  The beat is so nice though, that  I still want exclusivity to it , but am not sure if that's even possible at the moment.  Anyways, a little background on that.  Me and a friend from SIPI end up going to Montana for spring break.  My reason for going is to see a couple friends, and also try and lay something down for   Supaman  .  I did, but the verse was weak and the freestyling wasn't anywhere near being considered good.  Just my own thoughts on my own works.  Yet, if   Supaman   wants to use that stuff, he has my complete permission to.  So, I let   Trav   hear that li'l verse I spit, and he loves it.  He knows it's nothing near what I'm capable of, but suggests we use it regardless.  I say alright, and a couple months later, it's finally put down fairly reasonable.  I like the way the vocals came together this time, as I was more prepared and had a li'l more experience in the studio, so the apprehension wasn't there.  The song is oh so nice though.  I just might have to post it up sometime after it's officially released by  The Lost Tribe .  Then, we go and start shopping.  Me, Money, and a means to spend it all @ once, and I"m bound to act an ass.  I buy cd's, dvd's, and this time -- Clothes.  Surprisingly, I also get some shoes that don't come from Payless.  Now, I end up spending most of my check @ the mall.  No regrets though, I know I'll keep what I have for a long period of time.  Then, we hit the wow.  Meet up w/ cousins, long lost friends, and shockingly,  The Rez Hogs .  They hustling like usual, and  The Lost Tribe  tries the same.  So I'm just wondering aimlessly getting caught up in conversations about what I'm doing these days, where I've been, and what's going on later.  I already know though, that I'm not hitting up the club.  That's alright by me though, because I don't drink and I'm not that much of a club person.  I bought a small portable dvd player and am alright just watching some movies outside in the parking lot.  Then it happens, we hit up after hours.  It wasn't that bad @ all, w/ 100's of people walking, talking, singing, and fighting.  It started out crazy.  I ran into a weird scenario from jump, but won't get into that.  Then a homegul was all inebriated hanging onto me, hugging me, and just trying to stand up.  I saw a guy I didn't like that's trying to get in good w/ an ex by downing my name.  Oh wells, I'm more than sure he's going to say something about that, but there's nothing to talk about.  She was drunk, I was sober, and she was trying to stay standing by holding on to me.  She was also hanging on Lou and others too.  One guy tried to take advantage of her, but didn't get anywhere.  @ least when I was around.  I didn't stick around too long.  She was breathing alcohol breath on me and quite frankly, it stunk.  But, there were some drummers singing 49 songs, and a homey was having his b-day there too.  It was fun, until things got stupid.  Wellpinit folks are weird.  They like jumping folks.  They take pride in jumping folks?  Well, as things start to turn out, they want to jump trav and his friends.  Those wellpinit folks didn't know I run w/ trav though?  I saw one small guy w/ a bat, and I was manuevering closer to him if he wanted to try and use it.  He didn't though, but there were guys and guls gripping bottles though.  Too many for me to try and stop, but I was @ least going to try something.  Didn't have to.  There was a head up fight, but homey got rushed and got the worse of the exchange.  Things don't really wind down though.  Trav ends up getting hit in the face w/ a bottle and the rig I'm driving nearly gets mobbed.  Not only that, but one of my cousin's cousin almost gets jumped by those wellpinit folks.  I step up in front of him though, along w/ more folks, and he's given a pass.  After that, it's all about,   do I go home and chance it again, or not  ?  I opt for not this time.  I call in to work and get home the next day.

      Yeah, work again... &nbsp; Turns out, one of the folks that was supposed to be down for whatever had a better offering, and took it.&nbsp; Not so bad though, because they weren't all that important to team morale going up.&nbsp; Kinda harsh and all, but still truthful. &nbsp; This past Tuesday was crazy for me.&nbsp; No work because I had an optometrist appointment.&nbsp; I thought about the poof of air in my eye, and the dialted pupils, but oddly enough, none of that happened.&nbsp; It was some eyedrops in my eye that numbed them up for a li'l bit of pressure to test for glaucoma.&nbsp; That was it though.&nbsp; I got my prescription and for the first time, I think I might see 20/20 in each eye.&nbsp; But, instead of enjoying 'normal' sight, I have to wait until next week to pick up my trial pair of contacts.&nbsp; Oh, and I did manage to meet someone I forgot about totally.&nbsp; They remembered me, but I still can't put a name to their face.&nbsp; I just know I met them, and can kinda associate where I met them.&nbsp; It has just been so long since I met them though, that makes it hard to recall their name, or if even I'm supposed to know it? &nbsp; So today (thursday)&nbsp;turns out to be the first time for physical training (p.t.) in what seems like forever.&nbsp; Not bad at all, but when me and my ride (Dez) get there, we manage to both forget something.&nbsp; Well, his is actually important, but my thing is pretty trivial, yet good enough to ride w/ him to get his thing.&nbsp; We take the trip back, get our things, but kinda dog it on the way back.&nbsp; We even manage to stop by a local store to get some eats before heading back.&nbsp; Once we do get there, the complex looks like a ghost place almost.&nbsp; We start our ascent up the hill and while heading up, we let out some whistles and warhoops just to find out that everyone is out of earshot.&nbsp; So, we do the quick uphill downhill thing and start to wonder if we were in fact the only ones doing that?&nbsp; It just so happens we weren't, just a little late. &nbsp; But, the day before though, it was heated.&nbsp; Like in the 100's heated.&nbsp; Not only that, but I"m dehydrated from being sick too.&nbsp; So we're working out in the heat and I"m dehydrated trying to do my normal thing (bust ass).&nbsp; Turns out, I can't do that in my condition, and I had to find out the hard way, cramps.&nbsp; So my upper body is cramping up bad in various places in varied intervals.&nbsp; If it wasn't the shoulders and side aches, it was the chest and back.&nbsp; Then there was also the neck acting up too.&nbsp; So I thought that was that, but then the legs wanted in on the action.&nbsp; So I downing water left and right, but somehow, that just didn't cut it. &nbsp; After work, I get home, worried about cramping up more.&nbsp; I eat bannanna after bannanna and drink some powerade too.&nbsp; Altogether, I manage to eat about 5 bannannas to myself, and drink over a gallon of water over the day and night.&nbsp; All that, and still I try to cramp up.&nbsp; So before I try and sleep I get one last bannanna by the bed along w/ somemore water.&nbsp; Luckily, it wasn't needed. &nbsp; I wake up and hope today isn't as bad as yesterday.&nbsp; Again, it's hot.&nbsp; We do the P.T. thing and head off to our worksite.&nbsp; More of the same thing that made me cramp up, but instead of cramping, I manage not to.&nbsp; To keep the muscle tension at bay, I drink water and gatorade.&nbsp; About the same as before though, so yesterday's effort did pay off, just not in the timely manner I expected. &nbsp;

      Oh man, things were not well last night.  I couldn't sleep at all seemed like, and when I did sleep, I slept hard.  Now, I'm barely awake but, my entire body feels so heavy.  I wonder if I'm getting sick?  Okay, so I'm looking over some of my past writtens, and I'm still amazed.  Those poems are really good.  I mean, I'm looking at them like I didn't even write them.  It's like I'm a fan of my own work?  I wish things would work out to where I can just sit down and write all kinds.  I don't have the time, or even motivation though, especially now that I'm just dragging all kinds.  But, the event for the day is to try and make it 15 miles up north to go to the tribal optomitrist.  I had my chance this morning, but that's about the time I actually started to get some rest.  I'm trying to figure out who has a ride, and also who has the time to drive me around?  I hope I get a ride, because I need this to keep my job.

      Well, last night started off pretty good.  The Rez Hogs came in and we tried to get ready for the night's li'l local thing thing.  We got to the pow wow and I suddenly realized that even though it is a local thing, it's still pretty nice sized.  Anyways, they get to promoting themselves through their cd sales and I run into Tray.  We talk about this li'l concert that's supposed to go on, and eventually we get to heading to the community center, where it's supposed to be held.  Nice and fine, but no keys to get in.  Not only that, not much of a system to work w/ either.  But, this was all last minute, and we were definitely short handed.  Regardless of the odds stacked up against us, we still managed to pull it off, but not w/out the li'l conflicts.  So, I get to helping lay out the tarp to put on the gym floor, and not only that, finally get to checking the li'l system available to us.  Not only that, but also set up the rez'd out system for the 'dance' that accompanies this concert.  Yeah, but in that time, both acts (the rez hogs & lost tribe) head out their own ways for awhile.  So, people are waiting around, asking about the concert and dance.  Meanwhile I'm getting things arranged and when things start to finally look up, I see that the performers aren't around?  I manage to find the rez hogs and that part is settled, or so I thought.  It turns out they want to watch how the Lost Tribe does their thing and request to go 2nd.  No problem I thought, but when tray leaves because, 'he wants to be around when more people show up?'  That leaves just the Rez Hogs w/ a full crew, but they aren't going to perform until the lost tribe does.  Well, it's just Tuke around, and he's just waiting on tray to show.  So, people are starting to filter out, thinking nothing is going to go on.  After tray shows up, things get a li'l twisted.  He starts to demand that they're going 2nd because they'll 'tear it up, no doubt.'  I'm looking at the rez hogs and shrug my shoulders.  They say they'll do it, they're not that picky about it.  So, I get to cuing up the songs and stuff, but also have to play sound man, because one guy is smooth and laid back in delivery, and the other is hyped and amped.  Same deal w/ the lost tribe.  During the rez hogs' set, a couple guls get on stage and want to dance around stage.  No problem, they take advantage of their good fortune by dancing along, and rapping to the crowd.  They cut their show short, and let me know that this is just something thrown together, but they appreciate the chance to hit up another spot to get their name out.  Then it comes time for the lost tribe to get their thing on.  They are the local folks, and got some folks to watch them.  They did support the rez hogs though as much as they could by trying to get people into their performance.  things worked out though, and both performances seemed to be what the people didn't expect, but appreciated.  So the 'dance' is supposed to happen, but instead of people sticking around for that, everyone went outside.  Most likely it was all to find out where the party was going to happen that night.  I'm there basically just playing music for less than a dozen people, and most of them are either barely in high school, or still in grade school.  Oh wells, something happened that normally doesn't happen, young natives seeing other young natives doing something other than partying around or trying to hustle a way to make some ends.  I did what I could, but I felt like it was all too little too late.  It seemed to work out for both acts anyway.  So, they both get some sales and the folks get their first show from natives locally and from a rez close by.

      Oh man, things are nuts all over.  I mean, things usually start out innocent enough.  People are trying to  'have fun'  the way they've been doing for a long time,  drinking .  Around their friends and family things seem to be uneventful enough to not have much to worry about.  This is just a lead up to what I had to put up w/ last night, and early in the morning.  Breaking up fights here and there, and also almost getting in one.  One guy ( my cousin ) tried to swing @ me, but I shoved him and squared up just to find out he was going to start in on some young folks.  It's weird when adrenaline gets to pumping through you and your aggression levels suddenly skyrocket.  It's weird because, nothing starts to matter once someone does one wrong thing or even looks at you  'differently.'   I was ready to get into a fight w/ my own cousin in this state.  Well, we didn't, so I don't have anything to regret other than just shoving him.  Then, there were the other fights, and needless punches thrown randomly.  Younger bucks are trying to earn some stripes, but instead of doing anything like going up against people who will give them a go, they start in on each other?  Then, some folks just get wild.  I actually had to get someone off of another because of  a serious choke hold .  The guy's face was  purple  who was getting choked.  Someone came in and got his kick in, so I step up to him and he just says,  'that's my brother!'   It was his brother getting choked.  Before that this gul tried breaking things up and getting loud, so she was by the wrong person @ the wrong time and got punched out after a punch was thrown @ that guy but got her.  All this stuff going on, and I'm trying to get folks off of each other, keep some folks from trying to jump in and probably get jumped themselves afterwords.  So, after some serious violence and then a bunch of yelling around, I get to heading out.  I didn't take part in much of the violence, or even any yelling around other than just, " get off of him ," or " it's over !"  Well, that and " let's go, the cops are coming !"  So I get gone, and am knowing if the cops actually showed up, but they did in fact pass by speeding.  Probably to go to another incident elsewhere, but before they find out about the spot I was @, I was ghost.

      So, continuing off where I left off...  I get to doing what I do, that usually what ever the spur of the moment calls for, and then I get to heading back over to my cousin's house.  I find out that he's not around, and nobody knows his whereabouts.  Since I still had to work the next day, in the morning, I had to conclude my trip to the Yak Rez.  So, instead of doing the 'intelligent' thing of just heading home to catch up on some much needed sleep, I opt to try out adding more miles to my belt for the night by going to spokane.  I find out that that route is about 3 1/2 hours from Yak.  So, when I kept thinking I was going to be near spokane, I see that I am in fact not as close as I had thought.  I would normally be frustrated and start speeding around, but for some reason I had it in me to be patient and kept the regular pace of going the actual posted speed limit.  Oddly enough, I happened to wear my seatbelt as well.  The model driver?  Not really, I was listening to the new cd's I bought at volumes some would say is excessive.  Oh wells, I still made it just past midnight to my destination, or the beginning of it.  So, I get to Kospan (a.k.a. spokane) and manage to hook up w/ trey.  It was somewhat of a journey to get there though, but not too difficult.  Ended up @ a type of after hours party.  Mainly because there was a mix martial arts fight type of deal in idaho, not far from spokane, where The Lost Tribe performed.  I guess the song where I dropped 1/2 a verse was one of the songs chosen to use that night, but I was nowhere near there to be involved.  That would have been nice though.  Anyways, I get there, meet some new folks and reacquaint myself w/ others I already know.  It winds down quickly, and in order to force myself to keep on my toes I end up staying up all night.  A li'l discouraging facter is the fact I woke up @ 8 to be @ work that prior morning, so the drive home after 5 in the morning was pretty shaky from departure.  I'm heading out, and I'm doing fine until I get about 20 minutes away from home.  Nodding off starts to kick in and the eyelids start to lower consistantly.  Not so bad if I was somewhere stable instead of in a moving vehicle that I was attempting to drive.  Slaps to myself are given, and somehow, it works?  I got home and find out, I don't have to be in until noon...  Not a big deal though, because that day we staged on the rez preparing for the 4th of July fireworks being lit off to start some type of inferno anywhere withing close driving distance.  Oddly enough, it was uneventful during the day, so I got a li'l bit of sleep.  Nightfall hits, and we expect some activity then.  Well, just as the day was, the night ended up being a downer too.  Seemed so unexpected though, because there were mass people by the lake, and they were obviously intoxicated, but even w/ that factor added in, nothing?  AFter this escapade, we started to go to our regular hours, and regular jobs.  In a way that sucks, but it also allows for some form of relaxation to the mundane routines we got so used to prior to lightening strikes.

      work work work.  It's been hiking around, dig some line, and pack some stuff for about 10 days or so.  Before that though, it was about 3 days of classes about pumps and chainsaws [read previous post].  so, I work  11 days straight  to get  one  day off.  I took full advantage of that day off.  I didn't really plan on it, but what the heck, " road trip ."  I head over to yak rez to see my cousin for the first time in like a month.  Pretty good considering at times it was about  once a year  at times.  Turns out he had his 2nd kid the day before I get there.  Not only that, but as I'm pulling up, he just shows up a couple minutes before me.  Uncanny timing on my part I guess?  It was somewhat odd how I walk in the house, he sees me and nonchalantly says,  "Check this out."   I was expecting a new drawing or something, but li'l did I know he was gathering my attention to the newly born gul on the pillow next to her mom.  It was crazy seeing that, and him being all parental about her.  But, we get to talk for a couple minutes, and then I got to go handle some business elsewhere.  I told him I'd be back, but little did I know it was going to be hooouuuuurrrrrrsssss later.  More on this post after I get back from work today...

      I'm trying to send off 2 writtens (poems) I just did. It's to select folks, but  urlLink http://www.nativemail.com  is messing up? I write out some info on how they came about, but when I try to send them, nothing? I try to restart the whole thing and nothing again. I'm thinking it might be server problems, and @ worst, this computer I'm using.  So, I end up downloading the "Jesus Walks (remix)" from Kanye West featuring Mase. This isn't too different from the original, but they switch it up somewhat. I like it though. I'm not a church going person in anyway, but the things talked about in this song and the belief he shares with it is downright inspiring to me. I also like how it's somewhat militant too, but with a different message other than militant aggression. I seem to look and find I have a lot of Jesus songs or god songs, but also a lot of other songs too. Last I looked, I had 21 gigs of mp3's to work w/. Probably a lot more by now though, but I'll have to double check.  I would like to post those writtens up here, but things get too complicated in trying to do something like that. I like knowing where my works are being shown and who's seeing them. But, if you would like to see some samples of what I have, just email me @  urlLink windreamer@nativehiphop.net  = Subject:  What's up w/ the writtens?  Other than that, I just want some rest before things get started for tomorrow and I'm dead tired from not enough rest.  I got my Contacts in (The new prescription).  It's weird, to me, seeing everything in clear sight.  Usually I'm squinting around trying to read something, or just see it.  The crazy thing is, I have to use them on a fire, or mop up as it was today, instead of going somewhere or visting someone.  I'd rather have "good" eyesight to spot someone out of a crowd, or checking out something new to buy that was previously hard to see.  Also, I'm starting to yearn to see my li'l nephew now? Actually I always do, but most of the time I just pass it off as, " he'll be around sometime ," and try to work through it. This time though, I'm just wanting to hold him and try to make him do something he hasn't done before, or just see the things we don't get to see. Stupid work though, only giving me one day off a week, and stupid rest that is needed to be caught up on on my one day off. I think I'll have to make the 2 hour journey needed to see my neph neph at least for some hours, or even a day?

      Man, work used to suck, swallow, AND gargle too.  This is because of something often referred to as  the paperwork shuffle somewhere else .  Okay, so I know I missed some things for my Baseline Physical that is  needed  in order to fire fight.  Well, I knew of  one thing , which was a reading for the Tubercluosis (TB) test.  Little did I know, until later on of course, that my contact prescription was more on the  old and outdated  side.  That means two things are holding me back from getting on to fight fires.  Well, as it happens, people found out that I wasn't cleared, and not only that, seem kinda anxious to keep me away from fire fighting.  Well, that's my sole opinion on the anxious part.  Anyways, I thought it was just send it all in and that would be that.  Oh no, it has to sit somewhere for so long, and then they pick it up to set it in the " review " pile.  Meaning, it's just put in the " check this out whenever you can " pile, or just sitting somewhere else.  So, I get word I'm not allowed on the line, and I start to calling to get some answers.  It takes awhile, but in the end, I'm finally cleared to fire fight now.  It was really frustrating though, because the crew heads out and goes out on fires, but not me and another guy.  No, we stay in the rigs, or do warehouse duty.  If not that, it's just go home guys.  I wanted to yell around and stuff, but I knew that would get me nowhere, if not further down in whatever pile, if not just somehow, " lost ."  I'm actually proud of myself for not getting too heated and out of hand.  We got out on a fire today and it's going alright.  The person in charge wants some bladder bags (yellow packpacks of water) to work with today.  So, I'm trying to help someone out and carry two to get filled.  Well, I bring them back and start getting ready, but everyone else is lining up to hike out.  I pick up both bags and think, " yeah, someone is going to offer to pick one up ," but that never happens.  So, I'm packing up 2 bags that combined are about 80 pounds of extra weight on top of my own weight ( about 270-280 ) combined with my web gear that carries  other necessaties  like lunch, drinking water, and lunch.  Altogether I"m looking @ about  390  to walk around on.  Not bad though, I do what I do and march on through.  Not the  livliest  or  quickest , but a steady marcher no doubt.  So I use one up, and have another to work with.  This happens about 3 times in the first half of the day.  We take lunch and I give up both bags to two different people and pick up a handtool.  I was proud that I took to bladder bags, carried them both, and used them both numerous times for the first half of the day.  Not only that, but gained respect from forestry and pumper guys, not to mention my own crew members.  I in no way expected that, but it happened, so I'm just waiting to find out what else I'm capable of accomplishing.
