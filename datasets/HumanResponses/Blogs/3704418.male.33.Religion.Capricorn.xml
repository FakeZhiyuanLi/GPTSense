      Dream: I walk into a club that looks not entirely unlike the Tractor, early, for an X show. John Doe is working the door.  I ask him how're things, and he decides he remembers me from the last solo show, so he ushers me in as if we're old pals. His hair looks more like Billy Zoom's, though it's John Doe color, albeit with a good deal of grey in the mix.  John Doe is not a tall man, as I've met him before and I'm taller than he, but here he towers over me, as do the bar staff and the handful of other patrons who all seem to know me.  Must be his boots , I think to myself.  He takes me arm in arm up to the bar (the place is sparsely crowded yet), and asks me what I'm having.  I can't read the labels on the taps, so he orders me a pint of PBR, and the same for himself, but he gets a Midori chaser with a nod to the barkeep. "You're gonna have to get used to meeting people, you know," John Doe says to me, "'Cause that's how it is now."  "Right on," is all I can muster. Wake.

      This is the power of whatever arch demon or demiurge serves as the prince of this world: to have erected a structure and a system that serves so powerfully from earliest childhood to enslave and instill a near-autonomic reaction of fear whenever Reality asserts itself, or is suddenly revealed, thus crippling innovation, novelty, and the potential influx of Light.  All religious, theological, metaphysical, occult, even (perhaps especially) ethical arguments ultimately devolve into a dialectic of Fear versus Love, and each end of the spectrum is so intent on proving its own worth and rightness (righteousness), and thus destroying the credulity of its counterpart, that it ignores completely the creative tension in the middle -- which is precisely where Life happens, and where Spirit may most readily manifest and break through into the so-called “waking world.” Real religion, in the sense of “binding back” oneself to one’s origins (and regardless of specifics of tradition), scares the hell out of most people, as well it should.  Like the old Hebrew prophets’ visions of angels, staring one’s own soul in the face is an awesomely terrifying experience.  “And they were sore afraid.”  Damn straight they were!  To acknowledge the breadth and depth of who and of what we truly are is something for which most human beings alive today are completely unprepared.  Western culture has become a watered down mockery of itself, and by force of habit, when the full flavor is tasted on the tongue of humanity, the rational demon evokes a flight response.  Even those who have tasted Great Life in its Fullness are mostly incapable of maintaining the experience full-time, and thus tend to self-medicate with all manner of toxins and live out somnambulant lives in terror of the “vertiginous vastness” of it All.   Along this vein, Ganz, having pulled the truck over, reached into the glove box and pulled out a silver flask which he had earlier in the week filled with Courvoisier.  He opened it, let the fumes burn his nostrils for a second, then swigged.  He exhaled forcefully, then faithfully imitated Jack Nicholson in  Easy Rider . Staring off toward the southeast and the really and truly strange whitish fog that seemed to have formed (presently growing) over that mesa, his thoughts turned to Kate.  She haunted his dreams in sustained but sporadic intervals, and during such times (like the present one), she was first on his mind upon waking.  Not that he expected (or wanted) anything from her, nor had he the slightest hope or desire for a reunion.  In fact, this obsession was quite puzzling overall, and had the general effect of ruining whatever else might be going through his mind, or whatever activity in which he might be presently engaged.  Sex with her had been good, but it wasn’t  that  good, and frankly, neither of them had ever been at top form the whole four years they’d slept in the same bed.  But God!  Did he love her!  This is, at least partially, the life I lead, he thought.  To be utterly and completely in love with what/whomever I’m doing, no matter how fleeting, just for the present. The so-called “path of Aphrodite.”  A difficult and beautiful path, that’s for sure.  Crazy even.  In fact, it may well be that one simple thing -- Love -- that separates those few of us truly capable of embodying such a powerful force from the sleeping herd of the masses.  To be truly present is in fact to be nothing else but totally in love, and to love truly is to be strikingly conscious and awake.   Ganz, still staring out toward the mesa, reached into his t-shirt pocket and pulled out what was left of his American Spirit package and began rolling a cigarette, continuing along this line of thought.  This is not the mere firing of neurons and the squirting of primitive animal juices in our glands, but rather a profoundly “altered” state of consciousness.  Love of that degree and magnitude is impossible to achieve without tremendous suffering, and yet, it fills the heart with such compassion that to experience it in its fullness is itself its own kind of suffering.  Perhaps love of this kind has come to us humans prematurely and because we cannot contain it, we must buffer our inner senses lest we be consumed and thoroughly crushed by the sheer weight of Divine Beauty.    Having rolled a passable smoke, he lit it up and inhaled deeply.  He thought then of an old Gnostic prayer he’d learned from a friend in Seattle a few months before: “I have seen beauty by its own divinity destroyed, and love by its deepest desire betrayed.  Day and night, all the lovely abandoned things of the holy city cry out for redemption and a lost god looks out of every human eye.  I will never fall asleep upon the green grass while the earth rings with the cries of the exiles. Hear my voice mingled with every prayer. O Light, have mercy upon me.” Allowing these lines to comfort and sooth his burning mind, he continued to stare at the creeping mist which by now almost covered the entire mesa to his left.  Still smoking, he climbed up on the hood of the old truck to wait and see exactly what terrible and beautiful and awful and lovely experience awaited him on this night.  Now that the sun had mostly left this half of the earth to fend for itself for the night, a slight chill had skulked into the air.  He rolled over, reached into the cab through the open window and pulled out a denim jacket which he wrapped around himself, then lay back on his truck, and waited.

      Kate the Waitress and Former Lover of Ganz Anderson mopped up coffee from the grease-streaked linoleum floor.  The tile smelled oddly like moth wings burning up in an open flame set in a high school gym locker.   Those men didn’t look like any lepidopterists I’ve ever met , she thought.  Lifting a soaked brown rag to her eyes, she thought of the years with Ganz and felt an odd little tug in the solar plexus, barely above the threshold of consciousness.   What could they really be up to?   She glanced meaningfully through the front box window, noting as always the little place where the reflective sun-block coating was peeling away in the shape of a hunchback garden gnome. “Hey Irv, you know those Italians who came through here yesterday?” “Nope,” said Irv, fry-cook of few words. “You hear what they said they were doing around here?” “Somethin’ about butterflies. I wasn’t really paying that much attention.” Kate set the empty coffee carafe back into its cradle and hit the switch for another pot to brew.  Tossing the sopped rag into a chrome can set in the corner for exactly that purpose, and somehow simultaneously lighting a Parliament with a paper match struck on her fingernail, she said, “How often do you think four men in impeccable clothing -- you know what impeccable means, right?” [Irv nods.] “How often do you think guys like that, from Sicily no less, take a special trip to a part of the world as beautiful and bass-ackwards as this one just to go catch a few butterflies?” “Uh…” “Not often. I do know that much.” She tugged at a stray auburn curl that kept falling into her left eye, and inhaled deeply.  “They didn’t look like any scientists I’ve ever known, and believe me I’ve known my fair share of scientists. In the Biblical sense even.” “Yeah?” “I’m just sayin’.  I overheard them talking about some kind of ‘mozzarella butterfly.’  You ever hear of such a thing?” “Nope,” said Irv thoughtfully, scratching a pinkish scar on his forehead with the blunt end of a spatula.  “Seriously, either these guys were just up from some gallery opening in Santa Fe having a lark, or there’s some really weird shit going down.  You heard about the guy staying out at Ghost Ranch who died in the night last Friday?” “Him I actually knew,” Irv said, suddenly somberly paying attention. “He was a war buddy of my uncle Pete’s.” “Your uncle Pete was in which war again?” “The big one.” “Oh… You mean Korea.  So what do you know about the guy who died?” “Only that he once saved uncle Pete from being hauled overboard on a Hawaiian marlin fishing trip by some bastard fish.  They never talked about the war much.  I’d seen this guy at my uncle’s for dinner a few times, think his name was Eli or some bullshit like that.  He always had a kind of look that tripped me out, like he was lookin’ straight into your soul or somethin’.  And big eyebrows. Always wore thick turtlenecks and an old pea coat, and smelled like bird shit.” Kate pondered this briefly and chuckled to herself thinking  what difference does that make? , then returned to the subject at hand. “Well, all that aside, I heard he died out there in the middle of the desert at night, and when they found his body it had been so mangled by coyotes they had to pull dental records to get a positive ID.  Coroner said it was a stroke, but I’m not buying it.  Just a feeling I guess.  A hunch.  Maybe I should have been a detective.” The teensy bell jingled and the screen door yelped as an attractive youngish Euro couple walked in dressed in khakis, white shirts, and identical pith helmets.  They looked for all the world like some anachronism crawled out of a Hollywood scene of Victorian explorers. “Hullo,” said the fellow with ruddy cheeks and an undeniably Yorkish accent to Kate’s trained ear.  “We were wondering if you had any vegetarian dishes by any chance?” Kate, proud of her tolerance for what she considered dietary aberrations, smiled at the chap and said, “The macaroni and cheese is particularly good, but I heartily recommend the papas fritas with garlic and fresh chilies if you’re feeling brave. Lacto-ovo?”  Shocked, the woman of the pair said, “We do eat dairy and eggs, just no meat, including fish of any kind.”  Ordinarily this sort of statement made Kate’s skin want to peel off her body and melt in front of the poor green-hued hippy dippies, but somehow this woman made it all sound so attractive, actually giving Kate pause to consider a change in her habits.  She promptly shook this off, taking note that this lady spoke with an undeniably Canadian inflection.   Vancouver perhaps?  “In that case,” Kate offered, “I’d recommend the huevos rancheros with black beans, crème fraiche, and homemade tortillas.  We may look like we’re Podunk, but I assure you, Irv back there knows what he’s doing and his grandmother herself made the tortillas earlier today. Sit anywhere you like.”  The couple removed their ridiculous helmets in unison and took the booth under the front window just as the last pinks and reds faded to dark gray blues on the western horizon.  A sliver of moon shone faintly. Kate, pouring coffee: “So, uh, what’s with the hats, if I may ask without seeming rude?” “Wedding presents.  You see, we’re here on a sort of a honeymoon,” said the fellow.  Kate noted his “wife’s” twitching eyelid but said nothing of it. “Yeah, we thought it’d be cute to actually wear them,” said the woman. “Well, no offense meant, mind you, but they did make me want to allude to a certain Dr. Livingstone when you walked through the door!”  Kate had a way of insulting people that actually came out sounding like a compliment.  Something about her linguistic training must’ve brought out that talent, or perhaps it was a natural gift.  Either way, this comment set the couple immediately at ease, and they both leant back and looked expectantly at Kate. “Oh, I suppose now you’ll be wanting menus,” she said with a wink, and with catlike precision, seemed to have procured two of them from behind the counter across the room and placed them gracefully on the table without apparently having actually moved.  With a smile, she walked away and puttered for a bit behind the counter, feigning preoccupation with filling a sugar dispenser, ears trained on the table by the window.  Finding her almost depleted cigarette slumped in the ashtray on a corner of the counter, she took it and inhaled what was left of the cheap tobacco, just as the Canadian woman leaned forward and began speaking  sotto voce  to her “husband.” She, trying to be subtle and failing: “Do you think they’re here yet?” He, motioning toward Kate with his eyes: “Beats me. Should we ask if she’s seen them?” “Let’s wait that out.  Too soon to judge.  I’ve been here before, you know, and you really never know who you’re going to meet in a town like this.  Especially here.  Especially now.” Hearing this, Kate did her best to camouflage a gasp, and busied herself with salt shakers.

      "Gee, Gregg the temperamental Irish-Canadian biologist who's screwing his lovely young American grad-assistant Heather in the dark deeps of the Costa Rican jungle: whatcha doin' with that coconut shell?" "Just going to make a wee little pool. ... For the frog." Not knowing or really caring exactly  which  frog he had in mind (there being potentially millions of them in the immediate square mile of rain forest), I just blew some smoke toward his face (which he hated), and retreated to my hammock to pick up with my Garcia-Marquez novel.  That was 11 years ago today.  Later that night, A. took off with the local coke-runner Sempriano, and we all had to get wasted at the disco in town after suffering through the tedium of (yet another) nervous breakdown from our feckless leader (and a cursory search for A.).   But a different law prevails in jungles and in jungle towns (and apparently in biological research outposts), and unless one knnows how to interpret the omens, it can be rough going.  Thankfully for me, I'm much quicker at picking up nuance and omen than I am grammar or syntax, because in the jungle, it's all nuance and omen, a subtle language of body movement, chemistry, flirtation, intonation and eyes.   To this day I have utmost respect for A., if not because she had the bawls to take off on a night ride along the canal with a known criminal, or because she fell into a nasty coke habit for a while, worked as a stripper, and then pulled her shit together and went to law school, then precisely because she came up with the timeless phrase "what if I pulled a cigarette out of my nipple?"  That's one of the best lines I've ever heard, bar none, and I will never in good conscience be able to call it my own.

      “It’s a night for strange butterflies,” she said, tripping over her jaw in giggles. “Better wear a slicker!”   He tipped the ash that had backed up an inch on his square, slapped the waitress on the ass, and turned on a black boot heel to leave.   “I’m not kidding about the butterflies,” she sing-sang after him from behind the counter. “We had some Sicilian lepidopterists breeze through here just yesterday, said to watch for an opalescent haze forming over that mesa there to the southeast, and then, blammo!  Hope you got some good wipers on that rig, ‘cause you’re gonna need ‘em once the sun’s gone.”  He stared at her only long enough to adjust the tilt of his outback and take a long pull on his rollie, pondering how on earth this woman had ended up in Ojo Caliente after beating a Pulitzer-winning chemist for most-sought-after mensa recruit (a purely social construct, of course) in Seattle last year.  “Goodnight, Kate.”  The tiny bell tinkled and the ancient screen slammed as he left the café.   She always did claim to love waiting tables.  He understood this (or anything else about her for that matter) no better or more deeply now than he had in four years of living with her.  Ah, fer fook’s sake , he thought to himself in a cheap Scottish brogue.  Why do I think thoughts in badly executed ethnic accents anyway?   Throwing Kate the Waitress and Former Lover a crooked grin, he loped into the gloaming, all orange and hot, torpid from the day’s heat and no wind.  His truck smelled like gasoline, sun baked vinyl, rust, tobacco, and the desert.  Once it had been white, but was now caked with an impenetrable stratum of fine dirt and pocked with gravel scars, stump wounds, and hail dents.  Getting the old girl to start required patience, perseverance, and a good deal of magic.  Once going, dogs, who normally adore trucks, fled in terror.  Abdul had once said of the beast that even the normal encrustation of smashed insects in the grille and around the headlights was less than average — “Because they can hear you coming and ride those thermals higher, man!” he would say.  Between Ojo and Abiquiu, the truck was fêted, even if Ganz had only lived there just under a year.  It was rumored that the brothers at Christ In the Desert said special Masses just to ensure the safe passage of innocent travelers on the 84 in case Ganz might be out on some errand.  Even the dark Penitentes recounted legends of the truck in their gatherings late into the night.  Given the way New Mexico itself seems to sculpt the lives and souls of all its children unlike any other place on earth, it would not be long before the truck became a part of the local collective unconscious, to be remembered in hushed tones for years to come, even after its erstwhile driver was long moldering or scattered to the four winds.  Hauling himself into the cab, Ganz noticed some paper slipped under the left wiper.  He reached around to pluck it out.  The outer envelope, of very fine apparently handmade paper, was inscribed with the following:  Ganz Anderson, to whom belongs the Flame of Barbelo and the Secret Scourge of Abraxas, and whose Fate is unmatched among all living.   Not the sort of thing you expect to find on your filthy truck’s windshield outside a greasy diner in Ojo Caliente, New Mexico at twilight on the 3rd of July.  Not, in fact, the sort of thing you expect to find anywhere, ever really.  Ganz pondered this for a moment, stubbed out what remained of his rollie in an already full ashtray, and tossed the still-sealed missive on the seat beside him. Nonplussed but casual, he coaxed the truck into life and pulled out of the parking lot, heading southeast toward the mesa Kate had mentioned, over which a sort of milky smog did in fact seem to hang.    Somethin’ in those peppers maybe.   He recalled the first time he’d taken this road, years ago with two buddies on a road trip, brain full of LSD and Diamanda Galas on the tape deck.  The sky looked almost identical to that long past night right now as he eased the accelerator down and the earth’s movement faithfully offered up the illusion of a gorgeous desert sunset, resplendent with cenocephallic cloud forms and faint pinpricks of starlight behind  beginning to struggle through the remains of the day.   Whereas moments ago, he’d enjoyed a simple repast of huevos rancheros and fresh tortillas, had the characteristically random conversation with Kate, said wassup to the local psychic/palmist, Mr. Jorge Lacuna, and weakly considered his waning sexual prime and lack of a suitable partner, Ganz now found his mind engulfed in a strange orchestra of discordant themes, like Stravinsky being played by a children’s ensemble.   There are moments in life when one feels the subtle shift in pressure just before the Fates deal a heavy blow.  It’s like the slow climb up of a rollercoaster, and then that teensy little pause at the very top before plunging into extended chaos and potential death.   Danger de Mort  read the signs on French electric poles.  In that sense, too, it’s like that quiet wrenching ecstasy just before orgasm, or the way the sky smells before a lightening strike.  For Ganz Anderson, this was one of those moments.  He’d had enough of them in his 33 years to know what they felt like, and having recognized this as one, his heart rate increased and he felt a chill in spite of the vinyl of the truck seat still retaining the day’s heat.   Pull over, stop the truck, get out, and breathe.

      My brain needs a healing salve about now, a solstice poultice for the soul, and some powerful wake-me-up, as the Sun's entry into 0 degrees cancer has cast me in a most apallingly irritable frame.  Maybe if I'd cut my hair this morning...  Or if only I'd taken Madagascar in that game of RISK 18 years ago... I could have won.  And now, who is to say which insignificant choice or malformed decision will dictate (or has already set in motion) the curves over which the next half of this year will wind?  Everyone I know is falling apart. Is profanity allowed here?  I'd like to use some, please.  Not much, mind you, just a little.  I won't make it a habit, I promise.  Ah, well. This is somewhat akin to doing a nude stage role, except the audience could be anyone in the world or nobody at all.  Like swimming in puget sound, as they say, this will take some getting used to.  I can't stop thinking of the closing scenes from Bubba Ho-Tep, and every time it just makes me want to weep.  Is that odd?

      Vandy McMatterhorn sits at his ancient steel desk and stubs out what remains of a cheap Dominican cigar.&nbsp; Sultry city air with no wind floats languorously through an open window directly behind him, along with about six pounds of unfiltered sunbeams.&nbsp; The little analog thermometer in the corner of his desk clock/radio reads 69 degrees F; it’s been broken since October of 1981.&nbsp; A pigeon perched on a balustrade near the window makes what might otherwise be construed as a sweet cooing noise were it not coming from a pigeon.&nbsp; Vandy wipes sweat from his brow, which is immediately replaced with fresh sweat.&nbsp; “Why do I even bother?” he says to the stale atmosphere of his office.&nbsp; He looks balefully at the telephone, logs into hotmail (again) on his laptop, and sighs. New messages: 0.&nbsp;  Regretting his recent weight gain, Vandy hauls himself up from his creaking cracked vinyl office chair, and tries to get a breath of fresh air from the window.&nbsp; He is sorely disappointed, as the air in Seattle during a heat wave like this somehow never really feels fresh to the lungs, but rather heavy and old and somehow oppressive.&nbsp; He contemplates the taste of a pilsner.&nbsp; He contemplates the taste of several pilsners.&nbsp; He licks his lips unconsciously and tastes salt, which causes him to say out loud, “Shit, it’s almost five o’clock anyway.”&nbsp;  The pigeon coos insouciantly in Vandy’s general direction, and decides to head to the pub across the street.&nbsp; Vandy follows suit, but not before shutting the window, and throwing a bulky old file folder marked “s.b.r.i.g.d.s.” into his shoulder bag, along with his laptop and a rumpled tropic weight sport coat the color of flax.&nbsp; He checks himself in the round mirror by the door, runs fingers through what remains of his damp graying hair, and unbuttons his damp graying shirt one more notch. He locks the door to his tiny little 1950s film-noir-detective-style office, and exits the building.  Arriving at the pub across the street, Vandy finds the pigeon has indeed led the way, and is seated staring at him with inscrutable pigeon eyes from the top of a  Stranger  dispenser next to the bus stop.&nbsp; “Crooo,” it says to him.  If Vandy McMatterhorn had ever studied the writings of Carl Jung, or for that matter, any number of post-1960s “consciousness movement” intellectuals, philosophers, and psychologists, he might have paid attention to the pigeon.&nbsp; He might have recognized the entire contents of his day leading up to that moment in time as one long synchronicity.&nbsp; As it stands, Vandy had never read much philosophy, never been too keen on what he considered “fringe” culture, and thus maintained a fairly status quo existence which included a vaguely interesting job, a television set, the occasional drinking binge, yearly campout at Stehekin Valley with Maeve, a depleted savings account, a largely unfulfilling sex life, and an unnamed and unconscious yearning in the deep places of his soul that occasionally offered up disturbing and/or numinous dreams which he promptly forgot.  This is why Frank Popeet is always already sitting in the corner booth in the pub, eyes toward the door, cigarette smoldering, and the second half of a second pint of Hoegaarden soon to be emptied from his glass.&nbsp; Frank knows Vandy through their mutual friend, Ganz Anderson, whom Frank misses terribly since Ganz left for New Mexico last year.&nbsp; Frank knows Vandy will be arriving soon in a hot damp shambles, and he also knows (and regrets) what must be done.&nbsp; “Time for the old red pill,” Frank says quietly and observes the smoke twisting up toward the ceiling from the ashtray. &nbsp;“And as this incense rises before Thee, O Lord, so let our prayers ascend unto Thee,” he says, and drinks the sweet  whitbier  with great relish as Vandy McMatterhorn plunges through the door in a cloud of disheveled unconsciousness.&nbsp;  It is only after Vandy orders his usual Czech pilsner that he turns around and notices the bald bearded man in the corner, peering meaningfully at him over tinted spectacles.  “Father!”&nbsp; he says, ambling over toward Frank.  “Had a feeling I might run into you today,” Frank says, grinning, hand gripping sweaty flesh for a brief shake.  “You always say that,” Vandy says.  “Only when I mean it, which is, of course, most of the time. A bit of a scorcher out there, eh?” he says, wiping Vandy’s sweat from his palm on his jeans leg.  Vandy takes a long pull of beer, then looks thoughtfully toward the door and through the big window. In a gnat’s wing of a nanosecond, his subconscious mind registers the same pigeon’s presence on the same  Stranger  dispenser on the same sidewalk, though something about all of them has changed and his circuits are not yet wired in such a way as to discern the how of it all.&nbsp; Thus, his so-called “waking mind” chooses to ignore this anomalous data and proceeds to speak to Fr. Popeet about the weather.  “Yeah, but the Wappler kid says it’s supposed to be cooling off by Sunday.”  Frank suppresses a strong urge to laugh, and manages to merely smile.&nbsp; “We’re not here to talk about the weather, or weatherman family legacies, Vandy.”  “What do you mean?”  “I’m going to ask you to try and remember something: a dream.&nbsp; It can be any dream, but please try to recall something that might have awakened you in the night during the past couple of weeks.&nbsp; Can you do that?”  “Geeze, man, that’s a tall order.&nbsp; I don’t usually remember my dreams, but I guess I can try.&nbsp; What’s this all about anyway?” Vandy always suspects that Frank is up to something, but somehow always trusts him implicitly regardless, and rarely seeks a deeper explanation about much of anything.  “You just sit, enjoy your beer, have one of my smokes if you like – they’re in that case there – and try to relax and see what your brain will come up with.&nbsp; I’m going outside for a sec to get some air and pick up a  Stranger .&nbsp; Be back in a few.”  Fr. Frank Popeet rose, smiled at Vandy with that perpetual I-know-something-you-don’t smile of his, and breezed out to the sidewalk where he smiled the same smile at the same pigeon who sat dutifully on the  Seattle Weekly  dispenser where it had rested for the past few minutes.&nbsp; “Crooo! Crooo!” it said.&nbsp;   Dammit!&nbsp; Thanks, pigeon.&nbsp; It’s later than I suspected. Shit , Frank thought.&nbsp;  Vandy better come up with something fast, or this is going to be far more unpleasant than I wish to deal with tonight.&nbsp; Wonder how Ganz is fairing…   Disappointed that the  Seattle Weekly  was the only rag to be found in the immediate vicinity, Frank returned to the pub empty-handed and ordered up another Hoegaarden.&nbsp; He was dismayed to find Vandy sitting at their table with his laptop out, scanning personal ads.  “Man, I freakin’ love wi-fi,” Vandy swooned, then clicked over to hotmail, sighed, and turned his attention back to Frank.  “So, what did you come up with?”  “You know, I keep thinking that there’s gonna be somebody with some real substance that I can connect with out there, and I keep trying these stupid internet sites, and all it brings me is exactly nothing.&nbsp; Less than that even if you count the fees these assholes charge.&nbsp; Kinda makes me wish Maeve and me were more than just friends.&nbsp; I dunno…”  “I’m not talking about the sad disappointments of your dating life, I meant about the dream.&nbsp; Have you remembered one yet?”  “Oh, I’ll get to that in a minute.”&nbsp; Vandy seemed even more distracted than usual.&nbsp; “Hang on, I’ve got to…what the… Holy shit, man, let me see that  Stranger  you just picked up.”  Frank, noting a slight wave of nausea passing through his belly, reaches onto the booth seat to pick up the paper even as his voice says, “I couldn’t find one.&nbsp; All they had out there was… Wait, here it is.&nbsp; It’s right here, …right where I put it when I came back in from getting it out of the  Stranger  dispenser on the sidewalk.”&nbsp; Frank seems mildly excited, which for him, means something huge is about to happen. He lights a cigarette as quickly as he can, and turns as much energy toward Vandy as he can muster.&nbsp; “The dream, man!&nbsp; The dream!&nbsp; Forget that shit for a second, and tell me your goddamned dream!”&nbsp;  “Okay, okay. Calm down!&nbsp; I actually remembered one I had the other night, woke me up sweating.&nbsp; I was in the desert.&nbsp; I think Ganz was in it, and maybe you. Yeah, I think you were there too, and we were just watching this white cloud out over a mesa or something, and then these huge white moths or something came up out of a hole in the ground, and swirled up into the sky toward the stars.”  “And then?”&nbsp;  Christ, if this actually works, I may well have to buy a new pair of breeches , Frank thinks.&nbsp;  “And then we heard wolves or coyotes or something howling, and when I looked at the hole where the moths had come out, I realized it was only part of something huge, like it was the eye socket of a giant skull that stretched out as far as we could see, I mean like three or four football field sized.&nbsp; And then I think it was Ganz turns to me and says ‘The desert is dying,’ and he hands me some object that looks like one of those Egyptian crosses, and says to me, ‘This is the key to the northwestern quarter of this continent,’ or something like that, and then the scene started swirling, and everything felt like it was melting, and I woke up.&nbsp; Heavy, man.”  “You have no idea, Vandy.&nbsp; But you will soon,”&nbsp;Frank says, gathering up his stuff, and leaving some cash on the table.&nbsp;  So it’s him with the northwestern Key.&nbsp; All this time I thought it’d be me.&nbsp; I guess my work lies elsewhere. &nbsp; “Come on. I’ll explain what I can, but look, try to keep an open mind, okay?&nbsp; What I’m about to tell you is going to blow your mind, possibly literally, so I need you to come with me to my house.&nbsp; We’ll talk there.&nbsp; Alright?”  “Sure, but I want to take my own car, cool?”  “No.&nbsp; We need to be in the same vehicle unfortunately.&nbsp; Just trust me on this. Something big really is going down, just like we’ve always said, except it’s not ‘someday’ anymore.”  Vandy thought of the bulky file folder he’d stuffed into his bag before he left work earlier, and suddenly felt a slight wave of nausea.  “This is it,” Frank said as they left the bar, pointing to the pigeon sitting on top of the  Rocket  dispenser.&nbsp; “So it begins.”

      I often wonder how it would feel to be a burnt-out actor, like, say for example, Craig T. Nelson. Would I be invited to dinner parties at the homes of other not-getting-any-work-lately Hollywood types?  Would we bitch about the industry, stroke each other's worn-out egos, or talk politics?  Most of all, I wonder if I'd say things in the middle of the dessert course, unbidden, like, "My friends, I am a neolithic analyst who lives on residuals!"  My companions (none of whom, much to my delight, would know that I was the voice of the Monster in  Flesh Gordon ) would drop their spoons and stare at me wondering what the hell that could possibly mean, while I'd just sit and brood, slurping up a second helping of lychee-flavored mochi. A moth would then immolate itself in one of the candle flames on the sideboard by the open window, and we'd all retire to the patio to smoke cigars that we'd pretend were more expensive than they really were. There, with great gusto, we'd discuss our various surgeries, divorces, debts, and dirigibles.  Well, maybe not dirigibles, because it's not realistic to think of Craig T. Nelson in a blimp. No, that's not very realistic at all.

      “These tortillas are fantastic!” lauded the Yorkshireman as Kate refilled his coffee cup.   “Best you’ll find, at least within these hallowed precincts,” said Kate, gesturing with her hand in the air to encompass the immediate environs.  “So, what brings a couple such as yourselves to such an humble niche of the earth for a time as special as a honeymoon?”  She decided to be blunt but casual. “Um, well, this usually sounds really odd when we tell it, but Paul and I met in grad school,” said the Canadian, wiping egg residue from her mouth. “Nothing odd about that.  And what were you studying that people generally find so odd?” Kate asked, still maintaining an air of casual curiosity. “The chromosomes of butterflies,” replied Paul from York. “Oh, so it’s the standard tale of boy lepidopteran geneticist meets girl lepidopteran geneticist, they fall madly in love, and the rest is history, right?” Kate loved pulling out the stops on strangers, especially ones she suspected of ulterior motives. “Uh, yeah,” said Canadian lepidopteran geneticist. “You actually know what that means?” “Don’t let the apron and the nicotine stains fool you, honey, this diner gig is purely a disguise,” laughed Kate. “I live a life of exile-by-choice rather than succumb to the ludicrous ignorance and homogeneity of academia.  I’m actually quite happy here for now.  My name’s Kate.  Dr. Katherine S. Achamoth should you care for academic formality, which clearly, I don’t.”  Smiles and hands extended all round. “Julia Bosch,” said the Canadian, “and this is my partner Dr. Paul Scarborough.”  “Pleasure,” he said, “But I think we can drop the titles in the company of peers.” “And what is your field of study?” Julia asked. “Linguistics, semiotics, comparative mythology, and religions of antiquity.  Oh, and opera,” Kate replied. “My, my.  I suppose I can see why you take issue with the academy, speaking as a sister-in-arms,” Julia said, finding this all slightly difficult to believe, but intrigued beyond doubt.  “Taking issue is, of course, a two-way highway with only one lane, my sister,” Kate winked, and turned to replace the coffee carafe behind the counter.  A faint glow through the southeast window caught her peripheral vision. Now with some serious curiosity building, she gathered up what little trash had accumulated over the evening and made for the back door, grabbing her camera bag on the way out.  Looking toward the mesa, Kate was astonished to see that some sort of whitish wet looking fog had indeed appeared above it, and seemed to be growing.   Could those Italians have actually been telling the truth?  she thought.   And what about two lepidopteran geneticists coincidentally showing up now tonight?   She pulled out her old Pentax, removed the lens cap with now-nervous fingers and pointed it toward the glow.  What resolved through the 50mm zoom sent her spiraling into a simultaneous state of raw animal terror and pure divine ecstasy, like the feeling of sudden breathless awakening from an especially vivid or numinous dream.  “Oh my God,” she said aloud, barely a whisper, as the camera slipped from her fingers, clinking on gravel. "My God..."

      Since this seems as good a time as any to Reflect, I was struck tonight by the hilarious memory, well-known to my close associates, of a diminutive Texan with a high-pitched drawl once saying of me: "I seen that pisser! Comin' out the Farm Bureau the mornin' after it snowed wearin' nuthin'! I know he's been smokin' that ellessdee, but shit! He's cool!" This same individual, who drove at the time an oversized white Bronco (and probably still does, if he doesn't by now own one of those horrific Lincoln suv's) once said of another man's penis: "One side straight as an arrow, the other like a Moooooon Pie!" As hard as we may find this to believe, these quotes are real. Considering that Waco, Texas consciously breeds people like this as a social Darwininan excercise, it is not shocking.  But given that this is one of the most important presidential election years in living memory, it is imperative that we remember this. There are still people like J. Justice in this world, with no forethought whatsoever, no compassion at all, an egocentric work ethic that spurns social justice, with double-digit IQs, and many of them wield power. One of them sits in the top office of this country. Yes, I "seen that pisser" too.
