      Interesting: Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is the fear of long words, and Phronemophobia is the fear of thinking. Now, I wonder how that would work, I would think you would have to think about being afraid of thinking...the logistics are a nightmare.

      Slow Day.  It's pretty muggy here today, it rained almost all day yesterday, and I'm rather tired. I think I will try updating the main site a bit today. Add a few pages, ect.  If I feel like it.  By the way, I'm still adjusting the layout of this page, and it's the fourth time I've changed the look since yesterday. Expect changes.

      From the 'Hey, I wanted to know that' file,  urlLink Slashdot  reports that due to the increasing number of new products, retailers will need to add another digit to thier barcodes, from 12 digits to 13. Fascinating stuff, folks, just fascinating. Maybe next we can hear about the changing of the dewey decimal system.  I really hope it doesn't come down to me putting slashdot articles here just to fill up space.

      Hmmm, while I'm on the subject of TV, PBS (no, I don't just watch PBS) always pre-empts (sp?) Red Dwarf re-runs.(I've never seen them, so they're new to me.) It's so annoying! They could take off Judi Dench's mediocre comedy, As Time Goes By, instead!

      I have a new favorite television show, it's a nice show from Australia called SeaChange. It's on PBS, and it's about a corporate lawer-woman who moves from a big city to a small town with more problems than residents. PBS is so under-appreciated.

      I was watching a show on The Discovery Channel about the moons of our solar system, and it said that on Phobos, one of the two moons of Mars, you can throw a ball and then after twenty minutes turn around and catch it coming in the other direction.  But if you jump too high you could get pulled into Mars's orbit and eventually crash into it.  That's a nice vacation.  And on Titan, a moon of Saturn, there are seas made of natural gas.  That's where we should send smokers.   "Hey, you got a light?" "Yeah here-" foomph.

      Oh, yeah, I forgot about this.  I have been saving up for the entire Monty Python's Flying Circus series on DVD, around $150.00, and the Best Buy in town had a copy a week ago.  Now they don't.  I'm not mad at them, but it's very anoying that I couldn't be watching Michael Palin singing about transvestite lumberjacks, and instead I have to watch...hey, Fraiser's on.  Okay, thats good.

      As you may notice in my books section, the next book on my list is  Men at Arms , by Terry Pratchett.  Well, I've finished that in a week, and I have now gone BACK to the first Discworld novel (actually, novels, the copy I got from the library is the first two books combined.),  The Colour of Magic  and  The Light Fantastic .  I've been on a back and forth journey around this series.  I think my first was  The Truth , which I've been told is not a good one to start with, since it is a different point of view than the others.  Thinking back, I can remember what I was thinking of it, that it was humorous, but in an engrossing way, not a laugh-out-loud way.

      Today we had to take a PLAN test at school, which is a pre-pre-SAT test. Everyone says those tests show nothing about a person's abilities. In ten years we won't even bother to take them. But I got the afternoon off, so it wasn't a total loss!  3 day week this week, then mid-terms. What fun.

      Sorry, It's been a busy couple of weeks. But I do have a few things to say.  About a month or so ago, I mentioned taking that I had to take the PLAN test. Well today I got the results back. I'm in the 98th percentile of all sophomores. Yay! It feels so good to hear how smart you are from people who could care less.  And in other news, I've started a band. Well, not me specifically, but some people from school have joined together to form a band and I'm included. I play keyboards. Apparently, we're punk. I'm not a fan of punk, but who really cares about that anyway. I did hear some talk about covering some Pink Floyd. That's more up my alley.  That's all for now.

Hopefully the week will pick up.  Actually it probably will. On Saturday Greg is coming over for a Python-athon, in celebration of the delivery of my DVDs. Much fun will be had.

      Today our Scholastic Bowl team (It's a Jeopardy-like club, we compete with other schools in knowldge of all subjects) went to Von Stuben, and I'm not exactly sure where that is, but it's either Chicago or one of the suburbs.  We took the entire morning rounds in our division, winning five rounds out of five.  But in the afternoon final rounds, since it was single-round elimination, we were defeated.  And only by 15 points!  Plus I think that the moderator accepted an answer she shouldn't have, tipping the round in their favor.  I wonder what team she was for...

I'm playing the Barman and Zaphod.  If you have access to an NNTP server, check it out.

We have to write at least two of the poems, and the rest have to be published works. Hopefully I'll be able to choose; there is so much to choose from.  I'm listening to an interesting artist by the name of Tina Malia, an album called Shores of Avalon, and I recommend you get a copy. It's very good music. It's classified into "new age" but don't trust those classifiers. What do they know?

      You never realize how busy you are when you fit being bored into your schedule.  The 25th anniversary celebration presentation I mentioned earlier was postponed due to lack of interest, everyone was busy.  Our scholastic bowl finished our season second regionally, which I think is pretty good... On a related note, last night I went to a trivia night at someone from work's church. There were 4 other librarians there, plus some other people, and we came in first! $120 grand prize divided amungst us, although we did donate some of it back to the chuch. It was much fun.  Did you know that golf is technically an acronym? yes, it is. It stands for gentlemen only, ladies forbidden. Go figure.

      Ah, summer's here. Finally, a deserved release.  I recently bought a new computer, an emachines, from the local Best Buy, and let's just say there were problems. First the modem's drivers won't work. Not a big deal, I wasn't going to use it for internet acess anyway. Then the network acess card for my LAN quits. This is a problem. Gotta have a LAN. Then, and here's the kicker, for no reason at all, when I start the computer it tells me that the cpu fan has failed and that it will not start up. Well, that's just plain bad. Then I decided to try starting it yet again about a day later, and it starts up with no problem. Ugh. But now the mouse's drivers don't work. The tech service guy told me to exchange it for another one when he couldn't get it to work. Thank God for that.

I'm beginning to see what Douglas Adams was talking about: "If fiction is your line, the only option is to drink way too much coffee and buy yourself a desk that doesnt collapse when you bang your head against it."  Too bad I don't drink coffee.   *bang*

      One of my freinds sent me a couple of those e-mail survey thingys. You know, the ones, they ask you silly questions like "if you could be a crayon, what color would you be?" Great way to spend 45 minutes...  In case you're interested, I'd be orange-red.

      Today. Thursday. Thor's day.  As some of you may or may not know, I'm an aspiring writer. Aspiring being the key word there. I have had nothing published. This is mostly due to the fact that I am a  massive procrastinator  Not to mention a complete and utter perfectionist. My advice to any other writers, althought how I could give advice I don't know, is this:   do it!   I like big font.  Words of wisdom from me.

      Thought I'd take a walk in the big blue room today, but it's raining again. Hope the power doesn't go out.  Someone asked me what I put on my website, and I told them "whatever happens to me." They thought this rather boring, and I said "yes, I suppose you're right." But then no one comes here, so it's really just for my amusement.   hee hee hee!

      USA (the cable network) is brilliant. Here's why: instead of trying to compete with the big network companies, they've decided to start their best programs' seasons in the summer, and get basically no competition with anyone. Which got me to thinking, why is the summer hiatus a standard? Why do all the networks stop showing new (and good, that's the point) in May? Do people stop watching TV in the summer? I think not.   Flawed logic, if standard, reigns supreme.

      A new school year has begun. Challenging this year will be, I think.  Taking some honors classes (spanish 2: argh!) and I'm also in a class full of seniors. (they made it open for juniors this year, but I don't know how many people took it, I'm the only junior in my class!) I'm taking Chemistry, which looks like it might be my favorite class...  Now that I'm back to school, and I'll probably have alot more homework this year, I won't be posting here as much, but I'll try to post weekly.  Spanish: now there's a class where I need the babel fish.

      I was watching the episode of the West Wing that was made because of September 11th, and there's a great quote by President Bartlet (Marin Sheen's character).  "We don't need martyrs right now. We need heros. A hero will die for his country, but he'd much rather live for it."  On a completly unrelated note, I'm reading George Orwell's  1984 . Brilliant work.  "It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen."  And to conclude my post-o-quotes, here's Herodutus:  "Call no man happy untill he is dead."  /ponder.

      Monday, that dreaded space between Sunday and hell.  Actually, my Monday has been very good to me. I have tomorrow off, so today has been very light. My Chemistry teacher had a celebration for Veteran's day involving confetti-shooting cannons and red, white, and blue chemicals.  Plus some freinds of mine and I figured out how to make the confetti shoot out of the cannon more efficiently. Chalk one down for inginuity.  By the way, I love this new design.

      The comment feature is down while I renovate this place.  One thing I've gradually learned over the past couple years is that many times things that people say often are wrong. One example: that old spelling rule, "I before E except after C." It sucks. There are a TON of exceptions. Their, for example. A very commonly used word that doesn't follow it. People probably spell this word wrong all the time because of it too. This annoys me.

      Ah, Saturday. I slept till 10 today. Sleeping in is the greatest thing in the world, though it might be the reason I am so tired in the mornings during the week. Ah, well. Today was fantastically ordinary. Got up, listened to NPR's excellent news quiz, Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me, went to work for a couple hours at the library, got some books for a term paper, picked up a book of Ray Bradbury short stories I hadn't read before, came home, ate dinner (cube steaks and homemade macaroni and cheese) and watched a movie with the family, Bringin' down the House, with Steve Martin and Queen Latifa, which I give  two and a half stars. And so ends my ordinary day transformed into one of the longest sentences I've ever written. Hope you find my hum-drum activity interesting...  /ryan

      The other day I was sitting in my composition class, looking out the window. There was a large tree on the lawn of the school. It was mostly bare, nearly all of the leaves were on the ground around the tree. But there was a large section on the right side of the tree that was full of leaves.  I don't know why I feel compelled to mention this, only that I am.

      The days run together. I'm writing this, and I look at my last post, thinking it was a very short time ago I wrote it, while it was three days ago. Three? How did that happen? Well, it's not important.  I have a problem. I have to get up at 6:00 in the morning. This is too early for my system, or at least this is what my system is telling me. You think, 6 isn't that bad. 11:00 to 6:00 is only 7 hours. On a good day. So when I wake up, I go take a shower, and then go back to bed. This is my problem. I need my sleep, but I need to get up. This hasn't been solved yet, and has caused many rushed mornings. I need a solution. A real one. "Go to bed early" does me as much good as "Sleep upside-down".  /personal rant  (putting the /quip at the end of posts is fun.

It occurs to me that I'm posting what is interesting to  me , while other people might want to hear things that I don't find intersting because I was the person it happened to. Does that make sense?

But fear not, those who read my weblog, I have returned. Let's see...what's been happening to me? Work, as I mentioned previously. Pretty much day-to-day stuff not worthy of note.  I read some books, how about that? yes, that works. Well, I read a nice book of the short stories of Voltaire, I picked up a big book of Sherlock Holmes stories, and just recieved a couple days ago the new U.S. edition of Don't Panic. And a freind of mine at the library was nice enough to library bound that one for me, now it's all shiny.  Why do I have a weblog, you ask yourself, if I don't post for a month? I should ask you the same thing.  \wowthatdidntmakeanysense

      I can't write in the morning. For some reason my juices take a while to thaw, if you know what I mean. I tend to do my best writing right before I go to bed. Which is nice, because I go to bed with a nice air of self-satisfaction.  Right now I'm working on a short story about the Creator of the Universe.  More later, as always.

Now I'm listening to a Christmas music radio station while I type this.   Got some gifts a bit early...some Hitchhiker trading cards from my very cool aunt, the new version of Let It Be, the PC game of Return of the King, and a very very nice chess set.  Tomorrow I have to brave the crowds to do some last minute shopping. Wish me luck, I suppose...

      It's been snowing on and off this entire week. There are about three or four inches on the ground right now.  The other day in Chemistry class, we had a vacuum machine (sucks all the air out of something) and were doing some pretty cool stuff. We put a jar of shaving cream in there and turned on the vacuum, and the shaving cream gets exponentially large. It just keeps growing and growing. But that's what you pay for in shaving cream, air. Boyle's gas law or something. And we put a balloon in there, but that's not as interesting, it just gets larger and then pops.

      The Friday five. On Saturday. So sue me.  At this moment, what is your favorite...  1. ...song?  Coldplay,  Clocks . I've been listening to the album I mentioned yesterday pretty much constantly. When I get an album, I tend to listen to one song or two, and then when I hear the other songs they tend to reveal their complexity and goodness slowly, untill I love the entire album. It's the same here.  2. ...food?  I'd have to say McDonald's french fries. But they have to be fresh and hot, of course.  3. ...tv show?  The West Wing. This season is  okay , but the first four seasons are great. Absolutely brilliant stuff.  4. ...scent?  Cold Night Winter Air. I love to go outside and take a deep breath.   5. ...quote?   "My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind." -Albert Einstein. This is my belief system in a nutshell, Einstein sums it up wonderfully. I have it on my wall.

We came in third place consolation, which of course is another way to say seventh place. Stupid smart people.  Midterms were okay. That's all I really have to say on the subject.

      And now for the friday five. Because I like to jump on the bandwagon.   1. What does it say in the signature line of your emails?  My website adress. 'Cause free advertising is nice.  2. Did you have a senior quote in your high school yearbook? What was it? If you haven't graduated yet, what would you like your quote to be?  "If I care what this says in five years, slap me."  3. If you had vanity plates on your car, what would they read? If you already have them, what do they say?  If I had them, it'd probably be some esoteric reference only I would get and thus have to explain to people...  4. Have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? What did the inscription say?  Nope, never recieved anything like that.  5. What would you like your epitaph to be?  "So it goes." You know, from  Slaugherhouse-Five.

      Ah, finals week is over. Day off tomorrow.  One thing I enjoy about my job is the people. I see all types of people. And you can't help but listen in situations such as these. Listening is the only thing keeping me sane. People are fascinating.  Take, for example, tonight. I was listening to a middle aged woman teaching a woman from Taiwan English. They were going down a list of words, apparently, that start with B, and their definitions. "Buck." said the woman. "Is another word for a dollar. I have two bucks, I have two dollars." The woman from Taiwan repeated the word. "Bum." she said, moving down the list. "Is a person who lives on the street, and asks people for money. A bum will generally use this money to buy liquor. This is different from a homeless person..."  The absolute simplicity was what I liked about this. Black and white-ness, I guess.  This conversation brought me infinite joy. Bliss, even.  Find happiness in the very simple things. It's the only way to find it.

Normally I have to wake up at about 5 or 6 on Saturday mornings, in order to catch the bus to go to someplace or another for a scholastic bowl tournament. But not this week! This week I slept untill nine! And then I listened to NPR (Car Talk, for humor value, and Wait! Wait! Don't tell me!) for a while while fiddling around, basically doing nothing. Ah, nothing. I'd forgotten you.  I do, however, have tournaments on the next three saturdays. Arrgh.

      I'm feeling isolated.  Like a island in the atlantic ocean, surrounded by the void. Perhaps weekend depression is a bad thing. I don't know.

      It's snowing. I love to watch snow fall, especially at night. And I love to walk in snow. I guess I just love snow.  I recently discovered my camera has black and white mode. Maybe I'll take some cool photos to put on the site. Black and white photography is nice.

      I listened to the first Democratic debate in Iowa today on NPR. It seems to me that the Democrats as a whole would be better to adopt a "vote for one of us" strategy, because the image of a half a dozen people on one side of the room arguing amungst themselves and then GWB on the other side of the room sitting quitly not what they want to project.  Basically what I am saying is: unite against a common enemy!  But then again, who better than the American people to decide, that's what Democracy  is .  Maybe I don't have any idea what I'm talking about. Maybe my inane rambling is completely off-the-mark. But I think I have some kind of correct perspective.  I'm not sure about this election (even more so because I'll miss being able to vote in it by 4 months).

      If I were a type of sandwich, I would probably be a patty melt. Or a rueben.  mmmmmmm. rueben.  Today is the second to last day of my Christmas break. Unfortunately the time machine I'm working on isn't showing as much promise as I'd hoped. Damn you, modern physics. Stephen Hawking, you sly dog you.  Now I plan to buy pens and sleep for at least 9 hours.   Here is some light music.

      My work is dull. It's not that I dislike my job, I just wish it wasn't so boring. It feels like when I'm working my mind can just go away for a while, go read a book or something while my body does the tedious job of putting books away.  But I don't work again untill Tuesday, so I'm good for now. And now I'm going to dinner.

      The Friday Five!  What one thing are you most looking forward to . . .  1. ...today? Getting done with work, and being able to do something I want to do.  2. ...over the next week? Getting back to school, I've been very bored for the past week or so being stuck at home.  3. ...this year? Enjoying last year or so of the fruits of youth.  4. ...over the next five years? College! My entire life changing completely and utterly. What could be more exciting?  5. ...for the rest of your life? Finding myself. Carving a niche for myself in this world we all live in.   Happy 2004, everyone!

      I hate Sundays like this. I sit around whittling down the day untill it's dark out and I'm bored. Been bored all day. And lonely. It's what Douglas Adams called "the long dark tea time of the soul".  Last night was fun. Played pool, ate pizza, watched TV with friends. Much better than today.

      This morning I went down to the courthouse to watch my school's mock trial team practice. They're going to state next weekend, and last year they won state, I think even farther than that. They're pretty good, but I think scholastic bowl is better.

      There wasn't a friday five this week, so here's one from this time last year  1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?  Novels. And nonfiction (mostly science, philosophy, or anything that catches my eye) I love fiction. I write it too, by the way.  2. What is your favorite novel?  Here's my list. 1. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, Douglas Adams 2. Life of Pi, Yann Martel 3. American Gods, Neil Gaiman 4. Jurassic Park, Crichton 5. Any Discworld Novel by Terry Pratchett  3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  Honestly I don't read poetry. I write it, and I love to do so, but I think other people's poetry is dull because it's written just for them, a direct outpouring of a soul. Which is also why I don't really let people read mine.  4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  The classics. I have Moby Dick, Don Quiote, and A Tale of Two Cities on my shelf, never sat down and read them.  5. What are you currently reading?  As it says to the right, a book for general readers about string theory, and also a novel about a postwar european detective I just picked up.

      Something that's been bothering me lately: Religion.  Myself, I think I have a fairly sound world view. I was brought up to be a Roman Catholic, attended Catholic school for several years, and my high school is Catholic. And we're required to take religion classes. This year is morality. My teacher is a priest, and every class I find myself directly opposed to much of what he is teaching. I honestly can't figure out why. Why, even though I was brought up very similarly to my classmates, do I disagree with much of the canon?  Personally, I think there are not moral absolutes. I believe in a personal God, but only to some extent. I believe we are accountable for what we do on Earth, but not to an extreme degree, such as eating meat on some days (as I write this on Ash Wednesday). I believe in a God who works through evolution, who started the big bang, and programmed the universe in much the same way as a computer programmer programs an application, with parameters we haven't figured out yet, but we will. Whenever I'm asked to give my religion on a form or something such, I check the box marked "other". I am, to some degree, and agnostic. A member of the church of the free thinker.  But I attend church every Sunday. I even usher. Why?  I can't figure it out.  Oh, well. It's not that important.

      Had a chemistry test today. Hands down, hardest test I've ever taken. It would help if we actually went over the stuff on the test. But I still like the class. Hard not to like the teacher, he's just plain fun. The other day I mentioned to him a quote I'd heard about a physicist who said something like all other sciences are just stamp collecting or something similar, and a freind of mine in another class said he'd mentioned the quote to them. Ah, I'm quite sad, I know, but this delighted me.  Currently listening to: the best of R.E.M.

      Here's another old one. 'Cause I know how you like them.  1. What's your favorite animal?  Well, on an individual level, my dog Kelsy. But I guess on a species-specific level, I like the look of a good rhino.  2. What pets have you had in your lifetime?  One. Although I might have had a fish at some point.  3. Is there any specific pet that you've wanted but never had? Why?  Not really. I might like a cat, but my current dog wouldn't allow that.  4. Are you allergic to any animals?  No.  5. Do you have any 'pet' pet peeves (your pets or others')?  I hate when people leave pets outside to range free and kill birds (cats) and bark (dogs).

      I don't have much to say so I went through the friday five archives and here's an old one:  1. Where were you born (city or state or just country)?   Right here in Rockford, Illinois  2. What is your favorite number?  42 of course. My favorite one digit number is 5.  3. Vanilla or chocolate?   Chocolate  4. What section of a bookstore would I find you in?   Hmmm. Most likely in the literature section, or perhaps philosophy. Or science. But I could be anywhere. Actually, you'd most likely find me in the cafe!  5. What kind of mattress do you have on your bed? soft? firm? water?  It's semi-soft.

      The Friday Five on Sunday  When was the last time you...  1. ...went to the doctor?  May, 2003  2. ...went to the dentist?  I went to my orthodontist on Wednesday, but I can't remember when I went to my dentist last. If I can't remember that probably means I'll be getting one of those cards in the mail soon...  3. ...filled your gas tank?  Filled MY gas tank? Never, don't have a car. Filled the family's gas tank, last week some time. Tuesday I think.  4. ...got enough sleep?  Last night. Got to sleep in today.  5. ...backed up your computer?   I don't do that. Should I?

      It was a good week, nice and short. Today we didn't have to wear our uniforms, which is always great, very relaxing for everyone.  Tomorrow I have to get up early and play in a tournament hosted by the masons for scholastic bowl, but that should only last untill shortly after noon, so the day isn't completely lost.  Sunday I'm volunteering at the local natural history museum, a "paleofest". I'm a paleontology buff, it's true.

      Sorry for the large lack of updates. My life has gotten all swirly lately for some reason. It feels like time has been put in a food processor. Anyway, this weekend I went out of town, got some good reading done, read A Short History of Nearly Everything, I forget who wrote it right now, you may have heard of it. Good stuff. Got back Sunday afternoon and went to Sadie Hawkins dance at school, that was fun. Went out for Japanese food prior to the dance, someplace I'd never been before, very interesting. Monday I had off, went over to a good friend of mine's house (whose name also happens to be Ryan, wierd coincidence) and played some PS2 and billiards (I'd never really played before, but I picked it up quickly).   I learned something interesting the other day: Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, yes we got the day off for it, but Charles Darwin was also born on the dame day. Same year, even! So monday I celebrated Darwin's birthday as well.  Gotta go, some quadratic equations await my perusal. More later, as always.

      Wow. Much has been happening. Sunday and Monday were spent in Peoria, Illinois at the Illinois Clean Water Celebration. Basically a big environmental convention. I don't know why I went, but it ended up being on the most part fun. Got back Monday night, didn't have to go to school, that's always a plus.  Started the fourth and last quarter of my Junior year. Summer's coming quickly.

      Friday five  1. What was the last song you heard?  The Beatles. While My Guitar Gently Weeps.  2. What were the last two movies you saw?  Pirates of the Carribean (on DVD) and The Day the Earth Stood Still (on AMC)  3. What were the last three things you purchased?  I think Gas, Pens, and a PS2 Memory Card, in that order.  4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?  Study for midterms! Take some games back to Blockbuster Study for midterms! Go to Guilford high scool and play other schools in a battle of wits  5. Who are the last five people you talked to?  What does it matter to you? Paul, Ryan, Jeff, and Kyle in that order. That's a stupid question. Too esoteric. Like those names mean anything to the general reader!    And an update from earlier: a downpayment on a car was made today!!! We are picking it up on Tuesday!

      Whoa, its been a little while since I've said anything much. Alot's been happening.  Today my parents and me went and did the best thing ever for a sixteen year old desparate for forward propulsion: car shopping! That's right, it shant be long now. Yay! No more being dependent on other people's cars.  This weekend I finally fell to the yelling of the masses. I bought a Playstation 2. Peer pressure is a great force (just kidding, I'd been wanting one for a while). It was my birthday present, though my b-day isn't till the 19th. Speaking of which: 12 days! But before that I have to pass the minefield of midterm exams on the week leading up to it. I have my birthday off, how's that for niceity?

I didn't really watch TV as a kid.  3. ...the name of your very first best friend?  Bryan. Still friends today. But not best ones.  4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal?  My mum never let me eat any of the good stuff with all the sugar, so I usually ate Chex. But Chex is good.  5. ...your favorite thing to do after school?  I don't know what I used to do when I was younger, but nowadays I usually poke around the internet and watch Jeopardy! Is it just me or is Jeopardy getting easier?

      Smack dab in the middle of a very nice spring break. Nothing of note happening really.  Watched Bushie's press conference this evening (how could you miss it), and I was amazed at the utter waste of time it was. Every question was basically avoided and brought back to several key mantras. I especially liked how he said he wasn't planning on loosing his job. Guess what buddy, majority rules. And most likely this time, the supreme court won't toss the highest office in the country to you, Mr. I-like-to-pause-between-words.  God, I wish I could vote in that election.  Also a comment on my media viewing habits. The only TV station I watch for news is C-Span. Non-biased, non-partisan. And I love how they realize that the public owns the airwaves and put viewer calls on the air. For all other news I go to Google. There you get a good look at what is going on without all that slant. And NPR. NPR is good.

      Ah. So the elections were Thursday.  I lost. Expectedly. But grandly.  My speech was great, but you really had to be there. Everyone who saw it knows what I mean. And it was enough to bring the race to an actual competitive level. I lost by about 100 or so votes. And completely won the Junior class. So I say to you Mr. Jensen: does it feel good when a huge percent of your consituents, your actual class, the people who know you best, didn't want you to win and you did anyway?  Ah well.

      So here's how it is: I've decided to essentially commit political suicide. I'm running for president of the student council against the guy who's been president of our class for three years. He's a good public speaker. He's a great public speaker.   I tend to mumble and have never run for class office before.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING.  I just don't think he should be unoposed. I don't like him very much.  I read a fortune cookie once that said "Many a wrong step is made by standing still". Perhaps this is a wrong step, but it's a step. A leap really.  Elections are next Thursday.

Which is exactly what I didn't do. But it was a close game, that's all I'm saying. Other than that not much happening.  Oh. Except for the fact that I'm running for  Student Council President!

Waiting for him to call. Hope he doesn't hate me...  I drove around today and didn't go anywhere. Pretty much what my life is all about.  For those of you that may be concerned about my depressive state, don't fret; I'm too cowardly to kill myself.

      up down what's the difference.  feel like crap.  3 hours of working left. maybe I'll feel better after that. Actually I know I will, but by how much is the question. Yeah. If only I had anything to do after I get off work. But I don't. So there you have it.  I don't even know what I'm talking about.

      I didn't leave the house today.   Beginning to loathe free time.   Anyway, I read today that Sony is coming out with a handheld version of the PS2 due out next year. Sweet. They'll have to bring down the prices of handheld DVD players if they want to keep them competitive due to the fact you can have a game system with it with the PS2. That's what I thought anyway.  The Village comes out Friday! Yay. Haven't decided if I want to see Harold and Kumar go to White Castle yet.

      Coolest movie I've ever seen! I am completely serious. Spiderman 2 can go take a flying leap. Maybe I'm just a sci-fi buff but it was hands down just plain awesome. It had an interesting complicated plot, great special effects, and good pace.   My problem with spiderman 2 is, and this is nothing against the makers of it, but I didn't really buy him flying around the city, or maybe I just didn't want to. Anyway, my review: I, Robot spectacular, Spiderman 2 good.

      I got a sweet new pair of shoes. Vans, skateboarding shoes, my friend tells me. I don't skateboard. But they look cool. Anyone seen the commercials on TV?

      Sometimes it seems that way.  Saturday came and went! No phone call. No yes, no no. That sort of thing pisses me off.   I'm not that depressed anymore though. Just in desparate search of employment.

      What a crappy day. I've been in a sort of depressive stupor for a while now, since last weekend. It's what happens when I have alot of free time. Right now I hate where I live which also happens when I spend too much time here. Ugh. Gets on my nerves. Apparently my parents have changed the meaning of the word "garage" from a place you put a car to a place to put a whole lotta crap. My house is too small also.  Complaining because I'm bored, depressed, lonely, and need to get out of this fucking place. Hopefully I get that job.  There is really nothing on TV. Ever. Alot of shit that gets replayed over and over again.  How many days till college? Oh. That many? Damn!  I need to get the oil changed on my car.  ...

      Actually, although I said I should know on Saturday if I get the position, that's not true; I'll know if they want a second interview. Yes, slightly different thing. Sorry.  Wow it was hot today.

      So the interview I had yesterday went really well. I should know on Saturday whether or not I got the position. Fingers crossed!   Bought an awesome cd today, The Postal Service's Give Up. I really really really really like the second track. If you know this song, hopefully you know what I'm talking about. It's super awesome not to sound too idiotic.   My best freind is out of town this week and so I'm a bit bored and sad&nbsp;in case you were wondering how I was feeling. If not go screw yourself.   current music: supersonic, closing time. rather than the cd I just bought for some reason. Time for you to go out to the places you would be from.

      I told my supervisor that I quit my job on Friday, just because we were having our anual personnel review and I found myself asking what the heck I was still working here for. So my last day is the 30th, and I don't have anything else lined up. I have this feeling this is going to come back and bite me in the ass, BIG TIME. But it doesn't matter now, because I won't have to put books away anymore!!  &nbsp;  Applyed at Panera Bread Company for a position at their new restaurant somewhat near me, and there was a s^^^load of other people there. Saw some people from my high school, and some people I&nbsp;haven't seen since elementary school. But what did I expect, they put a huge ad in the classifieds...  &nbsp; And right now there appears to be a crew cutting off tree limbs in the alley behind my house at ten-thirty at night preventing me from putting my car in the garage. Ah well.

      Went and saw Anchorman, the Legend of Ron Burgundy the other day...very funny film. Can't wait for I, Robot, though.

      I suppose you all would like to know what I've been doing lately. Not much, I can tell you that. Not much at all. Today I played tennis with my good freind Ryan. Neither of us is very good. I'm okay when it comes to serving, but when I have to return it I can't aim it at all. And Ryan is just plain agressive when it comes to hitting it all the time. But it was great fun.  Just don't expect me to win Wimbledon anytime soon.

      Hey everyone, sorry I haven't been updating. Nothing new here, really. Looking for a job, I really need one of those. And that's about it.

      I am back, and I am great.  What has occured you ask?  Basically I was trying to clear my head and try and take care of some stuff that had been collecting in my mind. On Tuesday I went to Magic Waters (which is a local water park) with my best friend, on Thursday I went bicycling with that same freind and later we went mini-putting and then bowling, and on Friday I went on a two day catholic retreat with my very very cool freind scott. Fantastic experience, really met some awesome people. Got back today feeling fantastic. FANTASTIC I SAY.  The Villiage, which I did see last Sunday, was good. Yes. See it.
