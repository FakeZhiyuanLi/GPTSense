      Does this lack-of-school day count as a "Snow Day" or a "Fridgidly Cold Day" or "School Can't Get Heaters to Work but My Brother Still Has B-Ball Practice Day" or what?  Whatever, all that matters is that I'm not in fifth period right now.  And the crowd goes wild!  *mediocre applause*  I've knocked off whole two chapters of The Two Towers this morning.  I feel a sense of accomplishment washing over me... yes, I bathed this morning.  Since I'm still a tad ill, I've been decreed to lie around the house doing as little as possible, to regain my strength.  That's all well and good, but I kinda want to go shopping.  Not like shop-til-I-drop-or-similar, but just bee-bop over to Pamida to buy my Skating Sister a present for next week's competition and etc.    I'm really very funny, don'tchaknow.  I got out of bed today @ 7:30am when I could've slept til... now.  I took a nice little nap earlier this morning, though.  I had a very interesting 'dream,' although I think I was still awake... do you count that as a dream, then?  A lucid dream?  Anywho, I enjoyed it... then I snapped back into reality, kicked myself swiftly in the rear a few times and then kept reading my book.  The Real World and I don't get along too well.  I smote him like a mofo, Manda

      I really can't wait to leave this town. I love my friends, even you guys, but I still am painfully awaiting the taste of a town that isn't tainted with beet plant fumes and mediocrity. God I can't wait to leave. I'm not going anywhere amazing yet, but one day... One day I'll be somewhere nice. Somewhere warm and sunny, with art museums and sculpture gardens and coffee houses. Thus will be the stuff of my life.  Now is blegh. Then is ooh. Ten points for the future.

      Greetings from the land of Manda!  I'm feeling quite vivacious... or maybe that's the cough syrup, I don't know.    Are two journals and two blogs too much for a teen?  Tune in tonite on 20/20 with Baba Wawa to find out.  This is quick, this is short... but I guess you know how it works.    What good's a first impression? Manda

      So, in my on-going quest to find my true self, I was rummaging through the mail. Lo and behold, what did I find? Why, I found a lovely postcard, straight from the heart of Playboy. Jesus, I'm only seventeen. The last piece of my adulthood has finally locked into place with this three-by-five-inch glimpse of the world of magazine porn.  I am a man.

      All hail me and the crappiest essay ever written!  I hope I don't get an A on this paper that I just finished writing for Social.  If I get an A... that would be really, really sad.  I'm sure there are at least a dozen factual errors and who knows how many words I made up, but it's done.  And I even mentioned baseball once to appease Mr. Social Teacher's sports crazy mind.  But I'm done, and that is good... especially since it'is only 6:24pm... which is downright awesome!  I'm going to go eat spaghetti.  Enjoy yourselves.  The wood needs a-cording, Manda

      Hello hello all! This is my first official post as part of this lustrous community. (lol...b/c that REALLY just made sense.)  We have a long weekend! That's fun! I'm uber excited to go mindlessly shopping tomorrow.  Yesterday we had our first Speech meet. That was fun. I got first. *gleeful noise* However, it was also kinda warped. It was Valentine's Day and I spent most of the day hanging out with my  ex -boyfriend...and we spent most of it shamefully flirting with each other. :s eep? Yeah...if you guys are interested, I'll fill you in later regarding the rather...um...intriguing conversation we had last night while MSNing. Weee! Two thumbs up for raging hormones, eh?  I'm quite enjoying having a Sunday where the emphasis of the day is not centered around finishing my homework for the weekend. No no...that's tomorrow night's business. :D Yay!  That's about it.  ~Me~  PS: Do you think we should have universal "code names" for ourselves/people we know on this? Because I know we all call each other different things on our own blogs, and that could lead to confusion on this one. Yes? No? Maybe so? Input, please! 'Cause you know, if I wanted to say, "I hate Lilah, what a whorette...you guys may be confused as to who I'm talking about, huh?" hehe ;)

      Just updating the good 'ole community blog.  I'm currently at school right now, waiting for el News Broadcasting episode to finish rendering so I can put it on tape.  One of my classmates said "Manda is our savior," today in class.  I didn't really take a sense of flattery from that, it was more like "Damn straight!"  I can't believe I finished it.  I started editing on Tuesday... TUESDAY!  And I only had to stay afterschool for one day, but that was for over an hour.  And I took time out of Creative Writing and Social to work on it, so whatever.  I kinda miss my old News Broadcasting class.  There are some overly-active souls that I don't miss, but there are other cool cats that gave the class good energy, which my current class DEFINITELY lacks.  We're a laid-back bunch, which isn't very productive for the show.  I wish someone would teach me new tricks for editing... *cough*cough*.  I'd teach myself, but when I have THREE DAYS to edit an episode BY MYSELF, I tend to go for a more streamlined approach.    Well, Bloggers and Bloggettes, I should be going on my merry way now.  Don't drive too angry.    Damn the Swans, Manda

      Do you think I can pull it off? I don't know if I want to be in the spring musical. It would be fun... It would be jam-packed with singing, dancing, cast parties, and costumes, but, well, *sigh* I'd have to quit work for sure, and I'd probably drop my Web Site Development class which lasts the last five weeks of the semester. Speech and KB would still be going on, as would piano and band time HUH, as well as my four daunting classes. I don't want to hyperextend my self, yet at the same time, I don't want to look back and think that I hypoextended it either. I guess I need to be happy with balance. Balance between excitement and peace, independence and relationships, work and relaxation, McDonald's and tofu salad.  Don't forget reality and disillusionment. Those should be balanced too. I'm certain. Goodnight folks.

      *Sigh* I was waiting to write here until someone else stepped in an offered 50 cents of blogging, but I'm impatient.  And I've already dished to my own blog today, and I don't feel like lacing it with too much... content.  Moving right along.  I went to herr doktor today.  Found out I don't have nerd-monia, which is splendid.  He perscribed me magical bean pills, so hopefully I'll be capable of breathing without an oxygen tank come competition this weekend.  This competition is always interesting.  Example... last year I placed 1st in a category that I got 4th in two weeks earlier.  Then I placed 5th in a category that I got first in the week before... so I could either do really well or not so well.  We'll see how it goes.  Only two more competitions, three weeks and then the Ice Show.  And then it's Softball season... woo, scary.  But anywho, periodic properties await me.  Oh why oh why can't I submerse myself in work that doesn't require being here?  14-Karat Yacht, Manda

      And *sigh*... another day in Web Page, another notch of the giant belt of life.    Skating banquet is tonite.  Perhaps after this evening I will finally have my closure from neurotic figure skaters.  I would enjoy that... and there's free pizza and bars, I can handle that.    I went on a dairy binge last night... I had about 6 chocolate Oreos.  I'm such a disappointment.  *sob*  Walk like a North Dakotan,  Manda

      Congrats, Betso.  You've made me a very happy alternate!  Muahaha, next year your ass is mine!  Oh no wait, I suck at piano.  I hurt myself playing chopsticks!  Damn it, I got my parallel universes mixed up again.    I hope everyone (anyone?) enjoyed Youth Day.  I spent a good 4 hours babysitting a copy machine at the elementry school, but I got paid, so it's all good.  If anyone asks me to copy, collate, or staple anymore I will snap!  I'm so glad I'm not interested in education or business.  May I never have to take a course in Office Machinery Ettiquette for the rest of my life!  AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!

      Sorry Manda, but I realized that this Beatles' song quiz is kind of a sham... The only result, from what I can tell, is "Strawberry Fields Forever." Psych!  Anyway, life on my side of the bus depot is pretty good. I'm enjoying my spring break, even though I'm still not getting much quiet free time. I have tons to read, a friend to entertain, scholarship stuff to work on, piano contest songs to practice, a room to clean, and several other piling responsiblities to tackle. Oh well. I'm keeping my chin up. Everyone excited to graduate? I sure as hell am.  I'm so, so sorry Betso. We're going to miss you.

The great biographer of the time, Plutarch, wrote of Cleopatra, 'Her actual beauty, it is said, was not in itself so remarkable that none could be compared with her, or that no one could see her without being struck by it, but the contact of her presence, if you lived with her, was irresistible . . . It was a pleasure merely to hear the sound of her voice, with which, like an instrument of many strings, she could pass from one language to another . . .'  You have a spark in you that draws other people to you. Indeed, you are drawn to others because you are always curious.

      Supertriplets!  Saving the youth of Asia from unnatural band-related highs while recapping the hijinx at the end of every episode with an international dance number.  I smell an Emmy!  So the weather is very crappy right now, and that is frustrating.  It's been crappfully crappy all winter, and now that it's MARCH it should be marginally less crappy, don't you think?  But I guess all I can do is bitch about it, no?  The general population has been just a tincy bit annoying as of late.  Mr. Chemistry Man has attacked us with two impromtu quizzes b/c the doodle-dorfs in my class are too busy a) giggling like giddy school girls during notes, b) turning a sink and a plunger into an uproarious game or c) just being plain shite-heads.  I'm not suffering at all, but please just give me one less thing to study for, damn it!  And... repress.  Living my life in fear, paranoia rises again, Manda

      How's the club doing? I'm ready to be done with high school. Life is crazy, but so am I.  Speaking of that, I have a bit of advice for all of you: Don't be sane. It doesn't matter that you're crazy if you've found your way to be happy. Do what you want to do, dammit. Say "dammit" a lot and mean it. I'm starting to sound like the sunscreen song, so I'd better go sleep now.  Does anyone else get a strange high from playing those supertriplets in "Pirates of the Caribbean"?

      I'm pretty sure that this blog suffers from extreme emotional neglect.  It has a low self-esteem and is very hostile to others.  I hope the BPA (Blog Protection Agency) doesn't get a hold of this.  Since I've updated my other two blogs within a timespan of about 45 minutes, I can't say I have to much to say for the old community blog.  I survived Prom... and to tell you the truth, I would keep reliving the day over and over again just to keep myself out of reality.  Yes, even with the imprint from my headband.  It was an awesome day.  I knew what was coming, I mild to moderately seized the day, I had fun.  I got a little flustered at times, but it comes and goes.    I kinda wish I had a parlor talent.  You know, something neat I can whip out of my bag at parties that is instantaneously amusing to people.  People who can play piano and sing are really neat.  I might secretly dispise you for your talent, but I still think you're really neat.  It's only b/c I'm jealous.  Behold, the power of mediocrity.  It's Tuesday tomorrow.  There's not enough weekend in that Tuesday.  There REALLY needs to be more weekends in the spring.  Many many MANY more weekends.    I'm not really missing it, Bob, Manda

      I'm about to head to town to get my tux fitted for upcoming festivities. I kinda wanted someone to tag along, but I think it will be nice having a little alone time in which I can pretend to sing. Music tends to make me feel better, assuming it's positive music. Or negative music that sounds positive. Like punk rock--I can never take it seriously, no matter how serious the lyrics may be, and that's why I love the genre so much. Big band jazzy music makes me happy, even though I don't really have any. The closest thing I have is "Luck be a Lady" by Frank.  Ugggh, I really need to get going now. I have to be back to town for damned Pippin practice.  The show would be  nothing  without me!

      Beautiful plummage.    Softball team is supposed to take a field trip on Wednesday afternoon to see UND play NDSU.  It would be a lot of fun, but I don't really know if I feel like going to GF for an afternoon, when I'll probably have Pre-Calc and Chemistry to catch up on.  It would be nice to stay home, but then it would be fun to check out two moderately awesome college teams.   And then it would be awesome to chill with my homies.  I enjoy the warmish weather now, but I can't say that I'm a big fan of spring.  It's cold in the morning, so you have to wear a jacket, but by the afternoon it's like 65° and I don't have a spring jacket... that I like.  So I broil or I freeze.  Humph.    If the little things get you down, then the little things should bring us up.  I get a lot of enjoyment out of thinking about the little things in life that make my day.  Most of them are on my blog, but some aren't.  Some I don't even realize I enjoy, but I still do.    sinA = (cosA)(tanA) Manda

      I had piano contest today. On one hand, I didn't do very well; on the other, I didn't really care. I knew I didn't have a chance of placing, so I just had fun. I laughed with the judge--tried to anyway. She complimented my first peice, said I had a really nice grasp of it. She didn't say anything about the horror-plagued sonata. *shudder* I'm actually half-way proud of myself for not mistaking every other measure. It was every other  other  measure. Oh baby.  School is starting to relax a tiny bit, I think. I think it's just because I don't have any tests or papers due  this week , so I get the impression that I have nothing to do. In reality, I have tons to read, research, and write. Then there's everything beyond school... now this piano contest is done, and so is the speech season.  Whoa.  That's two whole things. KB was done a few weeks ago. I'm free! Now all I have is play practice for another two weeks, and then getting things in line for graduation, college, and whatnot. I'm pumped.

      M'ello,  Well, we graduate today. Most of us anyway; I'm sorry Betso. But for the rest of us--congratulations. I don't want to get all Hallmark or anything, but we all have worked really hard to get where we are today, and I think we should get at least  something  of a self-esteem boost from that acknowedgement. Do you get my point?  You guys--we need to have a good summer. Need. I don't have a lot going on, so I'm expecting lots of lunch dates, lots of movie parties, lots of bike rides and walks. AND, I want to plan a sandwich toaster party at my house. I'll bring the toaster if you bring the fun. Actually, I read the box, and it's a "Snackster." How quaint! I love it. There's even a recipe guide in the owner's manual, so we can make all sorts of edible jazz. I used it for the first time a few days ago, and it worked out well, despite the fact that I couldn't really find anything to cook in the sandwich. I resorted to using bread, dry salami, and graded parmasean cheese. It turned out pretty well, but I have plenty of room for improvement, and I need some guinea pigs; any volunteers?  Well, I have plenty to do today. I think I'll mow the lawn because that relaxes me a bit. I like being able to see what I've accomplished.  PS: Betso--did the pump work out? I hope it's running smoothly.

      Well, instead of my ears being really warm, my cheeks are now really warm.  I think that my skin is probably still recovering from the lake water or I got a little wind burned today... hmmm.  I don't think I'm going to write anymore about Senior Skip day, since I already did at my blog.  The community blog is for community things.  You know, like SARS.  So at the moment, I'm smelling my hair.  Yes, it sounds wierd, but it perplexes me.  I used a new conditioner for the first time today, and so my hair smells differently than it normally does, which is kinda wierd.  I'm used to having the same old smell circling around my head, this new foriegn smell will take some getting used to.  *sniff* Oh well, at least it's clean, right?  I can't believe I don't have any homework.  Hell, I can't believe I'm done with school.  This is so surreal.  That's my catch phrase for the whole graduation experience.  I'm extremely prepared to leave this town and it's football jocks behind, but I've been ready for this day since about 8th grade... and now that it's finally here... I don't really understand.  The clicky things in my head just aren't clicking the way they should be clicking.  I'm never going to see a lot of these kids again... *devilish grin*  I'm literally waiting by the phone now.  Well, it's just coincidence that the phone is sitting exactly 1.5 inches away from the computer desk, but I am awaiting a phone call from monsier Giles.  *dramatic reverb*  You don't know nothin', Manda

      My ears are really warm right now, and I don't really understand why.  It's both ears, so if someone is talking about me, they are saying good things and bad things.  You know, "left for love, right for spite."    My brother is extremely talkative when I don't want him to be.  I'm having a convo on MSN and I'm writing something in this here blog... I'm not particuarly interested in how you gave one of your friends a titty twister in gym class.  *shakes head*  I'm not going to be around for the last hour of my last real day of high school.  We have a softball game in the Town of Bags, so we'll be getting out of class around 1:45.  I'm bummed.  I can't count down the last seconds of 7th hour Chemistry while the rest of the juniors in the class glare at me feverishly b/c they still have a whole week left.  *snickers* Maybe it'll rain that day... ha, the weather is never so convienient.    Speaking of weather, *sticks hands in furnace*  I had a game today, against da' Rams.  HOLY-O-FRIGHT, I've never played in colder weather!  Granted, it was only a 5-inning game b/c they ten runned us, it was still super super cold.  Way too cold to play in, way too cold.  Our shortstop threw so hard that my fingers lost all feeling in my left hand... I think they might be a little swollen.  That's not good.  Especially not for the band concert tonite.  *tear* Last band concert ever!  Is it a good thing, or a bad thing?  I don't know if I'll do the band thang at Morris or not.  I know I can't be in the band b/c I don't have room for in my schedule... so I suppose this is my last band concert.  *for real tear*  Don't cry for me Euclid, Manda

      So, I overrode the powers vested in the co-administrator, Betso, by changing the template of the blog. It's kinda dorky yet kinda fun. *whip*  How's the community been? I've been pretty darn good, spare a few goings about from last night. It's nice to know that the school year is winding down. It's nice to know that  high school  is winding down. This summer is going to be crazy--in the sense that I won't be preparing for and awaiting another shitty grade. I'll instead be awaiting my college life, my adult life, my life all together. Scary, huh? I think I'll like the change of atmosphere. I think I'll love it, in fact.  Here's to a non-crappy summer.

      I haven't legally titled an entry since the bad 'ole days at Open Diary land.  Boy, that site sucks ass.  First of all, there are too many pop-ups, secondly the most frequent writers are probably the most vapid teenage whores I've ever come in contact with over the internet, *AND FINALLY* I'm still bitter about my blog being genitalia bombed.  Damn them all for all they're worth.  Best wishes to Betso tonite at her recital.  You'll bring down the house.  Are you gonna play any Ben Folds for an encore?  That would be pretty cool...  I straightend up my room a little bit today, but it's not so much as a noticible change as it would be under normal situations.  Almost a full quarter of my room is dedicated to my growning collection of dorm life supplies.  I have a Rubbermaid container filled with towels and blankets, a basket of sheets, a couple pillow shams and a bedspread, and other various items.  Techinically, it almost doubled in size yesterday, b/c my mom and I bought a mini-fridge at Home Depot for only $99.  It's a good little fridge, too.  Shall it display my Frodo magnet with great pride.  *smiles*  Dorm stuff is too much fun.  Mia got a lime green bedspread, I think that's really neat.    We gave you everything,  Manda

      Ouch. Sorry. I haven't been too good with this blog, huh? Though I would like to point out how much I've neglected my OWN blog. This one's just suffering the correct ratio, thank you very much. However, Manda has so "subtley" (subtly?...I could check, but I won't) reminded us that we are horrible human beings who have left this poor unfortunate collection of thoughts go unloved. Or that we, in fact, forget its existence. Or that we have other priorities. Whatever. In any case, I am scum. I am the bacteria on the scum. I am the amoeba of the bacteria on the scum. I am the nucleus of the amoeba of the bacteria on the scum. I am the...ok, I'm done breaking down scum anatomy.  Anywhore, heya blog. How've ya been? I'm peachy. I'm going to Bagley tomorrow. Really blog? You haven't been to Bagley? You really should. The sun, the sand, the surf *chuckle*, it's all good. I'll take you there sometime. You know what, blog? There're some good lookin' male specimens there. I don't know your preference, but hey, maybe those good lookin' specimens have some equally good lookin' blogs. What d'ya think? A double date? We can "log on" together. *suggestive wink* Do blogs have genders? Does it matter? Let's make a night of it. I'll be in touch.  So that's my two cents for the evening. Hope it was to your fancy, fellow bloggites.  "Idealism is what precedes experience; cynicism is what follows."

      Buy selecting the 'Edit Posts' button of my task bar here at the community blog, I see a lot of EDIT buttons... which means that I've been writing a lot in this here blog.  Well, not necessarily a lot... just more than everyone else does.  Does this make me a bad person?  No.  Does this make the rest of SiT bloggers bad people?  Damn straight--I mean, of course not.  ;-)    Perhaps I'm just the loser with the least amount of non-virtual goings on who has the time to write on the most neglected blog of them all.  B/c she feels rotten about it... she has empathy for the poor bugger... it's not fun being ignored, especially when all the other blogs are so popular.    *tear*    Today was an interesting day, I suppose.  Went to church, ate lunch with the G-Master, went to Inga's reception, by myself nonetheless.  I trekked the trip all by myself.  I'm pretty sure 'trekked' isn't a word.  I should probably delete it.  *shifty eyes*  Yeah, I'm gonna go away now.  I understand when my presence is needed, and when it's not.  Wallpaper knows its place, Manda

      It is currently the first day of June, which is the sixth month of the year, two thousand and four years after the birth of Brian--I mean Jesus Christ.  My day has been alright, I think... I went into work for six hours, and was instructed to go home and take Wednesday off, too, since there's nothing for me to do.  *knocks on wood*  This is quite the blessing in disquise.  I wanted a couple extra days to add to my vacation, and I got just that!  Woot woot woot for me!  So, I semi-finished cleaning my room today.  Everything's back where it's supposed to be (minus my newly acquired college stuff, of course) and I have some of my recpetion poster boards up in place of all the little teenibopper posters I used to have.  I put all of the "Academic Letter Award" and "RYLA Recipiant" awards in a nice little binder, and I have my chief prom pictures in nice frames.  I put all of my Beanie Babies (which were taking up space in the bottom drawer of my dresser) in a cardboard box and stuck it in the closet, then I put all of my un-first place skating trophies and put them in that bottom ex-Beanie Baby drawer.  You know, it's kind of a sad day when you box up your Beanie Babies and seal them with packing tape.  *zip*  It's like sealing your childhood aspirations into an airtight box, so no one will know that you once had little, 11-year-old dreams... and really big glasses.  Depressing really... oh well.  *straps on thigh-high boots*  One thing scares me though... all things things of the past I've dug up... what does that mean about the future?  *grumble*  Two bitchin' posters for the shipping of one, Manda

      Oh cripes.  This "rock and roll" fashion craze is getting really old.  I was skimming through a kid's Back-to-School catalog from JCPenny, and practically the whole damn thing was light-hearted skater/punk wear, complete with a shirt with a tie attached to it, including it's very own oversized saftey pin.  Converse, plaid skirts... the first page of the boys' section was all gothic hoodie wear.    What is this world coming to?!?  That being sad, I'm saddened to tell you that I've had the strangest urge recently to invest in several pair of opaque tights and plaid skirts to wear for everyday clothing.  I can't believe I'm letting myself get into this.  Anyone alive with a sex drive, Manda

      If Willem Dafoe and Joni Mitchell had children, their cheekbones would be above their ears.    I don't really feel like composing anything in paragraph format right now, I'd rather just scatter my thoughts into little sentances.  Joni Mitchell is what Mr. D always told us about creative writing.  She doesn't tell, she shows.    I wish I could write like Joni.  I wish I could sing like Joni.  I don't wish I was Joni, though.    Is Kurt Vonnegut still alive?    You can't make yourself love someone.  You can't stop yourself from loving someone.  Well, you can sure interfere with it, but brainwaves can disrupt heart strings.  This is what happens when you listen to too much Joni.  Paper currency, Manda

      hey sorry i haven't been blogging my little heart out. but my heart has been rather tuckered out. you see i'm really sick of people telling me what i forgot to do and for once i'd like to remember a whole weeks schedule but my mind can't seem to comprehend the phenomenon that is my life. poor cwanium. also these stupid on and off again sicknesses rather it be sinus headaches (oww) or sniffling like crazy (i even annoy myself)  well lets see. ahh yes band natzi scenario was observed before and it was sadly resolved in natzi's favor. *le sigh* stupid stupid. anyways, the performance went okay i fell but it didn't look too bad on the tape. I have a feeling i have the karin curse. which would be wierd...bless me father, for i don't want to be karin!!  dance has been going strong. all mea i was at dance. but i did hang out with my mom on saturday and recreated my hobbit being in green and gold. it felt good! what else...ummm v-ball  is now over. our last game was a bomb. WHY DID FULKERS TAKE ANN AWAY THE LAST GAME! *pout* stupid stupid. anyways, varsity has been having the time of their lives because of all the conditions fulkers decides to do AFTER pre-season. where's the logic in that. ridiculous.   what else....i'm missing a lot of stuff but i don't know. as most know, i miss jason. kind of wierd and the dream i had was odd. sad very sad. it's strange and ironic at the same time. whatever.   i've decided to go on a mini diet. it's not a real diet just to eat healthier and not go to fast food all of the time unless i have to. that means no fun hardees or shanty trips. oh well i think i'll survive. it's not like i have time for it. well i have in an hour so i better eat and then get out of here.

This week has been alright. it's only wednesday and i'm so tired. wah* i peeled myself out of bed and i made through school...reluctantly. we had a really bad v-ball game yesterday. i'm hoping that this special tournament will help us and finish our season on the right foot. i'm excited. Folkers kind of gave me a compliment today in his twisted kind of fashion.   Also Bina is the original and "superior" BAND NATZI! I almost blew up today in band. i'm sure you all know the story. grrr why does Bina have to be such a *censored* anyways now i have to put up with the wrath of bina/job/mary all in one day. damn the man for starting my day off wrong.  anyways so today's blog shall be the vent blog. tank you for understanding.   besides venting i've been working at dance and enjoying myself. yay! finally i'm getting more respect this year but lacking in other areas. h-hem...so, i'm done.

      ho hum...i'm tired and you know what procrastination is really on my side. i have been procrastinating to do my science for 12 solid hours. boo yah! i feel like balancing my checkbook. sneaky sneaky sneaky.  anyways, to put off my homework once again i am writing in my blog since i was too tired to do it last night.   so, saturday was pretty uneventful. i went to dance, worked my butt off and stilled managed to kill my feet...again! i don't understand, since when did the skin on my feet become so fragile. i mean i got a blister on the first day and now it just sucks. boo the many holes in my feet. also, i'm dying to see the cinderella ballet (professional company) because i want to see what i get to do and all that. also, we are performing at the football game on friday. yay! MOVE-DANCE-BE BORN! hehe. inside joke...with myself. sad i know.   what else did i do saturday. ummm, oh manda came over. we worked on science for an hour and then we went to the grocery store and bought all sorts of necessities including the grand enchilada - pistachios! yum yum. so pretty much i've been eating all day today because of those darn things. damn there utterly irresistable salty, pistachio goodness. *le sigh* besides eating i used a weed wacker and had a grand old time. when i first picked it up i said "chain saw massacre?" but then i got over it and liked the power under my fingertips. i am betso here me r-r-run-na-na-nun!  today i also did adopt-a-highway for my local community service help. it was interesting. so far no signs of ticks/any other kind of bug on me. yay! we even got pizza, pop, and ice cream afterwards. afterwards i went to Breathe. it was really good, although i almost fell asleep. they have to be careful how much soothing music they put on at a time. it was almost to relaxing.  and now i'm here, procrastinating, ah yes. it feels good but it's gonna hurt when i actually have to do it. dear god i hope chemistry isn't due tomorrow. wah.  wish me luck.  come to the land of the coconut, -Betso

      you know it's wierd. i've been called a genius today way to many times. i think it's an epidemic. i mean i understand that i may learn things a little faster than others but "genius" are you kidding me. all day i here angela moan and complain about some stupid little thing. i swear she does it because it annoys me. she argues with me about the dumbest stuff. get over it! if you didn't get an A i'm sure you got a B+.   also tonight there was the ever popular buggers v. planky hankies and surprisingly upsetting we lost. boo the buggers. stupid refs pinned everything on us. EVERYTHING! but at least they gave us the first downs we needed. we struggled today with a lot of stuff out there. i think wade should be QB. he plays smarter than everyone else.  i really want this cd i read about in a magazine. the band is called "Something Corporate." it said they have a Ben Folds-esc about them. but sadly i did not find it at target. i should look up when it gets released because i'm sure by the time it's released i will have forgot about it. damn me and my busy lifestyle.  152...sights into my soul, -Betso

      well today. i don't know what was wrong with me today. i felt light headed and just tired. i think i'm coming down with something but that would be really bad with my schedule and everything.  today was pretty much blah.   this afternoon i went to v-ball practice as i do for most of Aug-Oct and i rolled my ankle...again. classic and it pretty much happened the same way it did last time. mary's going to kill me if i can't go on toe tonight. :S i'm not looking forward to that but i'm looking forward to learning a new dance. it's been pretty dull doing the same dances.  so yes i've figured out that i have the most superficial class out of the entire student body. i mean they are just dumb! last night, i had a dream that i was yelling at Evil Edna about being so stupid and slutty. i really liked it but then my dad woke me up....she's lucky this time *evil demise plotting*   i had a revelation today i can't remember what it was but i was pretty proud of myself...oh yeah! have you noticed that Bob Ross is the only white man who has a decent afro. i mean many have tried but Bob Ross had it. and then to top it off with a hat to sit gently on it was brilliant. props to Bob Ross and his happy tree spirit!  siding artistic differences with myself, -Betso

      it's funny really. i start my blog the day i get pulled over for the first time. haha. what an eventful day this has turned out to be. so to go into detail...  the trauma really isn't my warning sitation/violation (dear god Garmen is currupt) it's when i talked to my mom about it. grrr. i've got a lot of rage. A LOT OF RAGE. who knew? i didn't even know till i was crying so fricking much.  (i'm kind of spacey so i may jump in blogs) i went to manda's. that made me feel a lot better. it's kinda relaxing just to be out of the house and not for a specific reason or to do your homework at someone elses house. horray for good friends.

      grrrr....stupid computer! i just wrote a big blog and now i have to do it all over again! pssh! i don't want to. i'm all about thought at the moment and this will be what i was thinking 5 minutes ago! grrr....  i'm quoting because this is what i have already thought and said...  "i've decided that i really like thursdays. i mean the only thing i do is dance for an hour after school. so it makes me feel like i'm active but i'm really not doing much at all. today was fun because i'm so tired that everything is just 10x more funny than it actually is. i mean i was laughing like crazy all day. from mr. barton's hip rendition of "Boom Dynamite" to the squealing in the hallway like a little 8th grader. you could not wipe the smile off my face today.  'the reason i'm so tired is because i finished a book last night and when i finish books i normally push myself to keep reading at night. so the night before i stayed up till 1:30am and then last night i was up till 12am. it's all caught up to me and now i'm struggling. the book was okay, kind of disappointing. but now that i'm done i can move on with my book reading plan. you see, i've accumulated a lot of books over the summer but i was always reading other books when i got them so i've finally finished them and can now read the new purchases...starting with Main Street by Sinclair Lewis.  'other news...PLANKY HANKIES beat HUMMERTOWN! it was really really cold but really fun to go see them. i rode the fan bus with Ambrosious. She was kind of mad about me getting window seat and her not be able to sleep because i move and stuff. i also beat her at slap jack *sorry* ...so the Planky Hankies are off to the Metrodome on saturday! it's not going to be cold! i'm excited!  if they win on friday they are going to play on the day of the recital. so i won't be able to go to that. oh well i'm sure we'll be listening to the radio.  oh yeah!  me and Lizabef O. are doing a duet this year. i talked mom into doing one. so it's supposed to be a comedy character number. we're not sure what song yet so if anyone has any ideas let me know. so far people want us to do chicago or i think spring time for hitler would be fun. also maybe next year me, pip, and tom could do Two Ladies. it would be a lot of fun. if only i could persuade pip."  well that's about it since i was so rudely interrupted last time i blogged. i don't think i can go much longer so g'bye  I Think I Broke Something, -Betso

      hello blog. i feel as if i've already written, but in actuallity i only wrote a really long email to my sister. oh well, as the times have followed, i've done many things. not necessarily important but substantial "burdens" if you will. i've had dance, piano, kb, jazz, pep band, foot ball sections....GO PLANKY HANKIES!!!  oh well, so today i had apostles. it bugs me that my partner, nathaniel is so negative. i mean he doesn't even try to be supportive. grrr i can tell he just hates one of the kids in our group. so here i am trying to keep the peace and the maturity level above 2 points. it was very hard let me tell you.   also for confirmation, does any have a good idea for a saint name for me? i've looked and i like Claire, but wouldn't ya know it. my sister had that one. i don't want the same one as my sister.   ummm other news, dance was great tonight although it only went to 6:30 because of the Matrix. i'm guessing three people went to it. i would have gone but i have homework and i'm a little short on change. oh well. maybe later. but still dance, was really fun and it didn't hurt to go on toe today. yay!!!! that's big news considering the holes on the side of my feet.

      BLOODY HELL! damn it. i write and write and then it's gone. i think i'm going to cry! this pisses me off. just another good reason why i don't use blogger much. i feel like screaming. #&$*$&#%@&$*#!!!!!! UGH! ok i'm letting go ....*breathe out*  well anyways i don't like blogging. i feel like i'm inferior and what ever i write makes me look stupid. i don't like my writing and then i feel like i'm graded by others who read it. they probably don't understand a thing i'm saying. i also feel like i'm taking up perfectly good blog space with my crap. i mean someone else might want my URL but they can't have it because i'm using it...well sort of.  i'm kind of in the slums lately. i'm bummed that i don't have any christmas presents for any of my friends. i'm a horrible person. i love seeing the look on peoples faces when i give them their gift. it's a great feeling to know that they're enjoying it. but sadly i only have Ambroscious' gift and part of Roma's. *sigh* i need a weekend to shop for other people. i'm a horrible christmas shopper...and then besides that people tell me they got me the perfect gift and i can't even think of anything to get them. *wah* so my goal is to give more than one person their gift before christmas vacation.   also thank you Ambroscious for the Sailor Moon episodes. i've already watched them twice and think the ballroom one is my favorite because of the "Free Dance Lessons." how controversial it all is. so after having the sailor moon get together i did some scouting and figured out that there are two versions of sailor moon. Sailor Moon R (my fav) and Sailor Moon S. anyways so the R version has wisemen and all those evil spirit characters and then the S version has the crazy glasses guy and Eugele. and to think i wouldn't have known a thing about sailor moon unless i watched the marathon in 8th grade. hooray for 12 hour marathons! anyways the reason i like the R version better is because the idea of it all is just so crazy. the thought of planets, and magic cities, and going into the future future is just so much to take in. you can see what i mean by reading the summary of it...* urlLink summary *  the moon tiara, moon scepter, or moon crystal.

      You are a  PHOENIX , in your soul and your wings make a statement. Huge and born of flame, they burn with light and power and rebirth. Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an amazingly strong person. You survive, even flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear failure. You know that any mistake you make will teach you more about yourself and allow you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater being. Because of this, you rarely make the same mistake twice, and are not among the most forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion, and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality and know that life is tough and the world is cruel, and it takes strength and independence to survive it. And independence is your strongest point - you may care for others, and even depend on them...but when it comes right down to it, the only one you need is yourself. Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your wings to guide you.You are eternal and because you have a strong sense of who and what you are, no one can control your heart or mind, or even really influence your thinking. A symbol of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very spiritual person with a serious mind - never acting immature and harboring a superior disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's stupidity and tendency to want others to solve their problems for them frustrates you endlessly. Though you can be stubborn, outspoken, and haughty, I admire you greatly.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Rain: You are the sound of rain.

      grrrrr* damn this wretched machine. and it's twisted intelligence (if that) *snub*...as i was saying before my blasted computer deleted it *wah* beginning from the top.  today i have been through pre-teen excitement to mid-twenties break down. (this all had a nice ring to it before *demiseful looks*) i'll explain-  yesterday i was informed that the dance company will have a uniform look for competition. this includes same makeup, hair, rhinestone placement, and shoe type. so for the rhinestone codes we will have three rhine stones in our part on the left side of our head over the arch of our left eyebrow which is two inches long. (did you get all that?) also we will have rhinstones on the end of our eyes, and we will be buying  rhinestone earings  *dun dun duuun*   well this came as a shock to miss mariam that i didn't have my ears pierced. i explained that, since i am in so many sports i never had enough time to get my ears pierced so they wouldn't close. well she blatantly asked me to get my ears pierced. of all the nerve...  well today that's  just what i did. i intended on getting my hair trimmed today and i just added the ear piercing to it. so while i was getting my hair done my hair stylist finds a gray hair * mid-twenties crisis * along with the aging i jump back to pre-teen essence and get my ears pierced. haha *"brad will love me now!" giddy happiness*   so now that the step into adult hood had been fulfilled i decided that the proper thing to do would be to have a "Disney Movie Night." This symbolizes the circle of life in all it's glory!  Well, there goes Bill. -Poor Bill- -Betso

I'm liking dance a lot. it's fun and i actually get some attention this year. i'm normally in the back and don't get noticed except when i'm doing something wrong. the one thing is i'd like to get my leg higher. why won't it go any higher i mean i'm working harder but it just won't budge.  one act - that's alright. my parts kind of fun. all 6 lines of it. i'm not really liking the atmosphere. all the jabbering is getting old. it seems like no ones trying. i don't want to win...i want to be done  KB - well that's alright. i like the practices except when we have an english lesson. and surprisingly enough we haven't done the buzzer practice. boo that. i think we'll do alright this year. we have a lot of new people. you can tell they are new by the way they buzz and their confused looks. haha it's kind of funny. Trixie is kind of annoying me. i mean i know she's just doing what she wants to, but it feels like she's trying to be me by being in one act and KB. i know i'm totally wrong about that, but i just get a wierd vibe when i'm around her.  yesterday i had my first free saturday in a month. it felt so good. i went shopping with Tatyana. we had a grand time. i got a lot of stuff. sadly the camera i want is way to expensive so hopefully i can save up for that by may. i want the whole sha bang. with manual focus and lenses. i'm shooting for a nice one around 200 at a pawn shop, including all the accessories. but other than that i got all the things on my shopping list plus a cd. i think i'm going to start my book today i hope i like it. it's called "Amerika" by Kafka.  We have contact, -Betso

      today sucked! i had to play stupid piano at church today. grrr sr. morgue. it's so frustrating. i never get to just be at church, i always have to play. that's ridiculous. i get a call last night at 6pm and sr. is desperately searching for someone to play. *hmph* that's dumb! i freaked out on her this morning. i felt bad afterwards but i couldn't hold it back. you know i was fine when i left the house this morning and then i was very bitter all of a sudden. that isn't really normal. i beginning to think i'm bipolar. that's a horrible thing to say. but it can be carried genetically...oh the possibilities.  also dance was really really agitating today. jobe went off on this hiatus about how he's older than we are and he's doing the steps better. why aren't we out showing him?...it's probably because he used to be on broadway! crap head! grr his teaching methods are stupid. he tells us we suck and then expects us to do it better. the only reason i did it better was because i was imagining crushing his head under my ballet shoe. it made me really focus in on my spotting. he also refused to give us water. our school is going to shambles.   mariam and jobe want to turn it into another nit dackerie ballet company. and we all know how the last one turned out. no one likes dance anymore but where are we going to go. treasuremites? sure...also the dancers at ndbc get paid to be yelled at. we pay them to yell at us? ummm no. if our school is just gonna be about impressing judges then why are we even in it. shouldn't you dance for lovin' dance. obviously not, where did i get that notion? oh yeah i used to like dance. oh well hopefully we won't suck at the next competition so they won't yell at us quite as much.

      what will betso do next...well today's current dilemna is i'm torn between two things. to join softball, or not to join softball, that is the question? i have a feeling i'm going to be really stressed out as it is and adding softball to everything would probably remove my sanity forever. but i love softball, i love how carefree it is. cracking sunflower seeds while losing a game. i mean what could be better. i loved sucking at it because there was no pressure. yay!  but then there is Pea Pine. it's gonna take a lot of hours. and there's no way i'm dropping out of it. should i join softball...aahh!  It's not a duck, dummy -Betso

      horray for a day off! so last time i blogged my computer was malfunctioning. let's hope that doesn't happen again. *nasty glare*  let's catch up on current events- one act was fun. we did well. we got to the second competition. i'm not sure what you would call that one. anyways, East Guh-Funk won which was exciting. We even had a little cast party. Horray for Kaida's massages! That was definately the highlight of the evening for myself.  other news- i had dance competition this past weekend in downtown Minneapolis. We got to stay at the Hilton. ooh aah swank! it was fun. the lobby looked like the taghmahal of all lobbies. sadly, the rooms were nothing special but it worked just fine. when i got there i saw MD himself. no joke, and then i saw many other egf people. i talked to duck footed and he said they were all there for some men's chior thing and they were staying at the hilton too. interesting...sadly i never saw them again after that but oh well it was wierd enough running into them like that.   the competition itself was not so good. the judges seemed to love one specific company and it got old real fast. they didn't really know how to judge musical theater so some of our dances didn't do so well. i did think the judging was fair though. oh well  there was also a workshop. i'm so sore because of it. my knees are bruised, i have big muscles in my arms, and my back is in wretched amounts of pain. the classes consisted of lyric/jazz, jazz, jazz/hip hop, and hip hop. if you thought i sucked at hip hop before think again. now it just proves the point that i REALLY suck at hip hop. this workshop was a lot better than dance olympus. i actually liked the dances. yay 10 points for that. and now i can't get them out of my system. i think they'll be there for awhile.

      well surprise surprise. i qualified for state piano. i'm not sure if i'm happy about it. Actually i'm pretty sure i'm not. i'm sick of the song and i want to play what i want and not have to be bogged down by polishing a song that i've been playing since october. *sigh*   well, i started picking out senior recital music. it's really wierd to think about. i need six piano pieces spanning the music periods. so far i have two romantic, one boroque, and a modern. what to do. anyone know any good classical? i don't think people will find much enjoyment in my recital. i would rather play jazz the whole time and just be background entertainment than be the center of it all. i will be playing just so people can listen. now normally i'm in the living room, no one's home, and i play for pure enjoyment. wierd...i like my way better.  tomorrow is instrumental solo contests. *breathe* my vibratos going to be pretty heavy tomorrow, being so nervous and shaking. crap! why must i shake when i'm nervous? oh well. i wonder what time i play?

      sitting in web page with nothing to do. unless i opt for the ever popular "dress the monkey" extra credit. but who really wants to dress a monkey anyway. i have a social test in about a half hour but i will more likely continue to do nothing and surf the internet as i please.   my throat hasn't gotten any better so i'm pretty negative towards the whole idea of being here, in school. *sigh* but i'm staying because i have "the most difficult lab i'll ever have" this afternoon.   i think my class is sad. they are talking about a great remake of "Take My Breath Away" by Jessica Simpson. i've lost all respect in her ever since she questioned the term "Chicken of the Sea." I feel sorry for her loss of brain cells. Poor Jessica. Also, Annie is trying to burn the grand march songs and i'm not liking any of them so far, but who cares. *moments later* Ahhhhh O-Town *crying and screaming* how i hate you with a passion!

      You are an Elementalist. Your magic stems from the forces of nature. You might be a forest nuturing Druid, a storm-creating Weather-Wizard or any of the many Elementals, but one thing is sure-- your bond with nature is strong. You can rely heavily on nature to support yourself aesthetically or physically for it lends you both comfort and strength. Your instincts rarely fail you.

      so my computer is experiencing a little bit of virus troubles. *whoa is my computer!* i think i've cured the old girl, so hopefully i can write in my blog again. lately i'm just feeling good about myself. i've realized that i'm lucky to have great people in my life and all that jazz. yay go them!   so my weekend was rip roarin'. i went to a play in east gah funk. it kind of reminded me of  you can't take it with you . it had it's high points but it also had it's low points. all in all fun for the whole family i guess. i've also managed to get to trips to "The Urb" this weekend, and guess what, they have chai! oh happy day! it's so bad for you, yet so good...saturday was swingin', i had set work in the morning. i think it will be okay, except for our costumes. i'm a little worried that i won't get "crotch beads." oh the humanity! I think Maury is taking the costumes the wrong way. it should be reggae. not king arthur goes to the circus, but there isn't much i can do.  today was alright. i woke up as usual and went to church. the priest was a visitor and i think he should go back to where ever he came from. he definately wasn't the greatest. i also had dance and got an overview of next year i.e. - Hitler returns to the Midwest! Marium and Joby have decided that next year will be hell -All soloist must be able to do fortes -we will start numbers this summer -Giselle will be the second act of our "Christmas Show" -We will be manipulated into performing at the Chapman Fritz -You will be put on "probation" if you miss practices. -We will have to be better than DL (no one cares except Marium). -We will put up with all of Joby's temper tantrums -And don't forget we're supposed to have fun! (not since 6th grade)  yeah right! the only way i'll get through this is if Al and i stick together. we'll be teaching a stretch class (which is good) but we will probably also be pushed into everything else. this sucks! i like dance but not the politics. maybe i can learn how to get rid of communism at girls state. that would be rather handy at dance.  This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting. -Betso

      the continuation...so darian's folks are on him about how expensive everything is for prom. He said he's been fighting with them for days. I don't find the logic in that because he only has to rent a tux, buy a tie, and a corsage. So he told me that he might not be able to go to prom. *weep* I don't think i could find another guy on short notice. I hope i won't have to deal with it. oh well i won't stress. i'm quite tired. so its off to homework and then bedtime yay!  Matrix: Low Battery, -Betso

      Ah yes the joys of Web Page. I'm sitting here just hanging out. I guess i'm a little faster than most. So...i'm exhausted lately. i can never get enough sleep and when i do sleep i've had really wierd dreams. my current odd dream goes like this...  so i'm on a train and i'm just hanging out and i see my cat on the railroad tracks. what in the heck, so i pick her up and put her in a plastic bag and then in my pocket. i made sure i didn't twist the bag so she could breathe. later these two guys start chasing me through the dining cars and sitting cars of the train. it was really weird. i escaped and i checked on elektra because i was worried she would of had a bumpy ride. i reached in my pocket and she was a little kitty and also notice that somehow the bag had twisted and she wasn't breathing. i screamed oh my gosh *frantic nurturing* i undo the bag and she's dead. i hold her in my hands and she's just dead.  weird thing is, is that lex has been really affectionate lately. i think she knows. *shiver* so that was awfully traumatic. other news, umm Darien's rents won't let him play baseball. i feel really bad, but there isn't much i can do. me and deutaronomy gave him a big hug yesterday but nothing seems to cheer him up. also, he informed me that his dad is on him for how expensive everything is...bell rang! g2g.

I won state piano as you've probably already read, but i'm just adding it to my archived moments. I'm not going to the concert thing because I don't want to deal with all the wild practices. I'm glad that an alternate will get to go. I've been an alternate on numerous occasions and I was bummed, but now someone gets to go!   I also have prom shoes. Go my mom! Also, I guess Darian is kind of ashamed that he can't drive me to prom since he doesn't have his license. *how cute* so he and his buddies are shootin' for a limo. It should be quite an operation, but fun if it works out.  My webpage is done. I think I'm going to post it on the internet. Ms. Elm seemed pretty impressed with it.

      Dance competition was fun. We went to Cats. It was very good. I was pet twice, Busterfurjones stole my cheesecake, and I was almost wacked in the face by Rum Tum Tuggers foot. All in all a joyous occasion fun for the whole family. The competition part was kind of hopeless. The judges were really easy. We got 2 emeralds, 3 diamonds, and the rest were all rubies. That means we got "1st" in practically all of our numbers. Which is odd since we didn't really do awesome but we did well. We did get some judge's choice awards though. That was cool.  The irony of irony was the Sportsmanship Award, which was given to a different dance school. (we got this award last year) A lot of our girls were saying, "that's not true" "they were such brats" *nasty glares*...so you're saying we didn't get the Sportsmanship Award. I would have to agree with that. Oh well, I pointed that out to them and I don't think they quite got the irony of their nasty glares.  On Sunday, I had piano competition. It went fine. The judge had a lot of sympathy for my limp (a knee injury at dance) it was cute. I hope I didn't get too much sympathy. i.e- win. I played all right but not as good as I would want. Oh well i got a shirt. yay!  The ride home sucked but oh well it's over now. i had re and we went to the villa. i met some cool people. they have a lot of hobbies. i would too if i were stuck there. they complained about how there was nothing to do on sundays. :(  after the villa, i went to the prom meeting. i guess Patwa has decided that me and Vivian are pretty much the decision makers. It was cool but odd because no one even knew we were making all these decisions. But now we have a grand march background, champagne glasses, and sheer. yay!   Around 9:30 I went to Roselyn's house and we worked on our presentation. I wanted to be done by 10pm...I obviously didn't make that deadline when I got home at 11:15. *sigh* I also wrote that crappiest english essay of all time yesterday. I was ashamed to call it mine. It's now handed in and there's nothing i can do about it. at least it's gone.  Oh p.s I got into Girls State. i guess miss alternate thought she was a shoe in for it. wah ha ha! now she can't rub it in my face...little snot. i think it will be fun. me and Babs will have a blast. sadly i'm going to miss my cousin's graduation reception. oh well.

      well another day another dollar. things have been moving right along. no shocking news just news. life has been going pretty fast lately. i pretty much bounce from one thing to another. I've got the play, dance, KB, the band formerly known as pep, and homework.  so today i had piano. it was rather enjoyable. i finally get to work on a new piece of music. and i think i know my order for my recital. *te he* exciting. i do need some people to sing, dance, play an instrument, or recite poetry. it doesn't really matter. but i have 2 breaks so i need someone to fill the time during it. god knows i wouldn't last if i didn't have a break. 2 of my songs are 20 mins long. *sigh*   this weekend i have dance competition and state piano. i don't really care about either of them i'm just excited to see my sister. yay! it was her birthday on the 4th so it's kind of cool that we get to see her. happy quarter of a century!  other news...i'm missing two and a half days of school this week. it's quite a leap from the average--at least one day gone per week--i should really stay in school. oh well. life goes on.  the band formerly known as pep is struggling lately. i don't think the 2nd trumpets can read music and that makes me hurt. especially when i have to stand infront of them. goll dang it pick a note and play it. don't keep fumbling around trying to find the right one. -p.s-they didn't find the right note :(   And so ends our broadcast day (cue anthem), -Betso  P.S - This is fun-- urlLink Hobbit Name Generator --I'm Peony Bleeker-Baggins of Fair Downs.

      well hello there. it's been a while since my last blog. current news: it's my birthday tomorrow. sadly, i have to be reminded of this because i'm pretty sure it would slip my mind otherwise. i don't have any plans so i'm just going with the flow.   other news, i have a new procrastination tactic. hazaah! i now create websites when i don't want to work otherwise. i created two as of yesterday. i uploaded my personal webpage from my class and now i'm working on an art site for my many creations (or lack of.)  not much has happened lately. i'm not as busy as i used to be. i'm not sure if i'm sad i'm not busy or if i'm actually enjoying my contentment. i feel i'm getting lazier because i am. i don't work as hard anymore and i have to be yelled at before i'll do anything. i have to get over this or i think i'll turn into a blob of matter. yuck that would suck. i need to be active again for the sake of my sanity.  i have a lot of big school projects coming up and plus dance happenings and everything else. hopefully i'll survive the rst of my junior year. back to reality.

      Oh ps I won a Nintendo Game Cube at Bede. It definately isn't that entertaining. i've decided to cash it in or get the original receipt. Who knows. I find it really ironic that i got a nintendo. ever since i was little i wanted one, but my dad was always so strongly against it. and now i have one and i don't like it. odd.   i think i'm going to Software Etc. or something like that. i'd like to get an X-Box so that i can play dvds and stuff. we'll see what the price comparison is. i have a feeling that the game cube is cheaper.   to top it all off i woke up to Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da this morning and i can't get it out of my head. *wah* it's so annoying. i love the beatles but it definately isn't one of their better songs.

Lina did my hair. it looked awesome. hairspray really does make the world go round...or keeps it together. i still haven't washed it out but my scalp hurts from the half hour it took to take it all down. all those rubber hair tyes and the bobby pins. oh the humanity!  darian was a really fun prom date. i picked him up and sadly he didn't know how to put on his bow tie (clip on) and his cufflinks. haha...that's awesome. but we figured it all out. good thing trevor was there to save the day. i figured out the tye but i'm new to cufflinks.   grand march was an adventure. it was bad enough having girls all around me freaking out about what to do. *breathe* but sadly my shoe did get caught in the blue stuff on the stage. oh well i don't think i ripped anything, maybe just a little pride. but i smiled pretty and i got cheers from people in the center isle.   the dance was fun i got a lot of pictures, in regards to the amount of pictures i usually take. everyone was beautiful and looked "sharp." i even got to wear the ever famous hat. *i wish i looked good in hats* i was also given the best compliment ever, "...for a white girl, you've got rythm." *flex* i was also deemed "the one who can dance" *flex x2* i'd say the dance was the best part of prom.   sadly darian couldn't come to the after party. he was bummed and i could tell. i couldn't do much about it unless he wanted to put up a fight with his parentals. the hypnotist was great and the pizza wasn't bad either ;) i never knew that matt had such an imagination. he even had a good rap ;) he'll always be my favorite liberal democrat.  the answer to all lifes tough choices: Is it on sale, -Betso

      i think i need a kick boxing class or something. i'm just on the verge of tears along with anger. i'm not sure who to be angry at my piano teacher or myself. we were playing this Debussy piece and i was having some trouble reading the page but i could play througho it pretty well. i was getting really irritable and i have fever and...i want my mom! *rage* i probably shouldn't be mad at her. she's been mad at me since i wasn't able to make the recital because of Pea-Pin. i feel like that's hanging over her head. what the hell can i do about that?! do i have to gravel and kiss your toes? good lord i'm sick woman, i've got baggage! i really don't want to ruin our relationship. but the past two piano lessons have sucked because of our moodiness. i don't know...*rage* but i'm still bitter...  habit is a form of exercise, -Betso

      well it's been a while. current news circulating the household is: "Congratulations it's a vacuum cleaner!"...and not just your average vacuum. This is top of the line, 5 star hotel vacuum. it comes with a hepa filter, a mini vaccuum thingy, dirt sensor (with red and green light for easy reading *insert awes here*), also has dual side sweepers and add attachments, plus its purple. this is like the vaccum from above. it puts all vacuums to shame. now, because this vacuum is heavenly, my mom has made it a need to have every room vacuumed to perfection. i'm hoping she'll get over it soon.  Pea-Pin is opening for real tomorrow. i'm really excited. C.J finally knows his lines and the whole play seems to have come together. except for the war scene. goll i suck at the part but life goes on. today i played the part of Catherine for the lovely Liona, who is currently at state speech. go her! it was interesting but i think i did alright. i don't exactly have the range but i managed. *sigh* someday i'll have a lead...*dreamy wondering*...maybe.  Other news, I got an A on the US Lit assignment from hell. i'm pumped! i'm pretty sure i made up half of the report the night before at around 1 am. oh well he thinks i understood what i was doing. wah ha ha! fooled again!  But now i have enormous amounts of homework to do and read a book by the end of this week. but p.s - i found The Kitchen Boy at my local library. I'm pumped! so i'm going to read that as soon as i'm done with Farhenheit 451. *sigh* it doesn't help that i don't have time to do half the things that i'm doing.  On the sixth day of Christmas, my true love ran away, -Betso

      You may have noticed my little revamp. I think it's temporary. It hasn't worked out terribly well, but life goes on. I'm still trying to work out the glitches. Carry on and have a lovely day.  I'm running away from this boulder, -Betso

      life is feeling pretty good right now. my sis came home for an enjoyable four days. i had a lot of fun but the only problem was my scheduled demands. i felt like i had to check my watch all the time. i hate that with a passion. i feel like i'm being rude but really i just don't want to be late for things.  also exciting news, i have a manual camera! woot! it's called an  urlLink Asahi Pentax Spotmatic F . (although this site has the much cleaner version) I was amazed at what some people could find in their basements. to top it all of, Ju-on found the original case and strap. and also a 135mm lens. yay! the only problem is i have no where to put it. i lost my cool camera bag and cleaning kit. *pout* it would have worked perfectly...*sigh* oh well  Lily and I have a photography outing on friday. i'm muy excited. We can go hiking and take pictures. yay! all i have to do is get through tonight. *bum bum bum* We have a 6 hour RE retreat. *wah* i think it's going to be hell, but oh well life goes on....and on and on, at least that's what it will feel like tonight.  I also have  urlLink Mermaids . the essence of my family's pop culture. this is how AFG and I came to be the way we are. so i'm excited to inducted new members in the phenomenon known as Mermaids.

      hey blog fans the world calls my name. i'm in a really good mood and i don't know why. maybe it's because Pee-pen actually went well today. yay! i think the show will be okay. i think i've found my home in drama. i never really noticed it, but i like who i am at drama. that makes me feel good.   this summer will suck tremendously. i'll laugh, i'll sulk, and cry a lot around August. Besides working i have, marching band, sports accel, volleyball, dance, and a sr. recital. *sigh* sounds like my east shore afternoons are almost out of sight. but i will still fight for east shore and walks. go walks! i'm going to take advantage of my summer. i'm going to have summer kiss my ass. woot! now i just have to wait for school to be done. *sigh*  watch the seconds go by slowly, -Betso

      i logged on to blog, but now i can't remember the basis of my blogging occurence. oh well. ps i think i figure that for my senior dance solo i want to do "It's so quiet" by Bjork. that way i can get in some lyrical but also spice it up with musical theatre type things. *strikes a fosse pose* also, i practically got my middle splits tonight. woot! i think it's because my left hip is practically out of socket, that, or i tore a muscle. either or. but yay i can go practically to the floor! this is major excitment for me because this winter i was about 9 inches off the ground by now i'm 5 inches closer. i feel like sing Miss Independent and running around in my underroos when no one's watching.  other news, my sis is coming home tomorrow. i'm really excited, but kind of bummed because i won't be home much at all. darn pippin all nighters and dance.   hit, pelvic thrust, hand over, pray, out, roll "Good Lord!" -Betso

      ahoy and good afternoon! i feel refreshed. ACTs are done and i didn't do very well but that's okay. i had a relaxing night at home on saturday and saw a bit of Emperor's New Groove. i've decided that ENG is my favorite Disney movie and i will be in pursuit of a not-so-expensive dvd. other news, i didn't want to kill anyone at dance. yay for no bad vibes! umm, me and al ducked out early to go to a prom meeting. we walked, which is something i intend to do more of. screw vehicle transportation the sun calls my name! prom meeting went fine. my job is pretty much done. yay! now all we have to do is get vases and decorate on "The Friday."  darian and i picked out flowers yesterday. it only cost us $19.98. woot! yay for sales. ummm, also my mom is going to make me a garder so i no longer have to spend money on one. (another plus) and also i don't think i will be having any jewelry because i'll have a corsage and my neckline is beaded. so prom prep is all done accept for hair clips and the actual meal.   in other news, i guess there's another pippin problem. hehe. i'm pretty sure the play is cursed. also, since miss speech is going to state (yay!) we will be having a sunday afternoon performance...noooo! so now i can't go to my piano recital. and i was actually looking forward to this one. *sigh* oh well i'm anticipating another problem...*devious plotting*  Twelve going on spinster, -Betso

      well i'm not really "beside myself" but yay for Unky who made the mood after my suggestion. Go Unkymoods! I'm currently glad for it to be friday, but the fact that tomorrow is saturday ie- ACTs, makes it crapfully crappy all at the same time. I'm procrastinating, as i usually do. i'm supposed to be studying for ACTs, but that doesn't appear to be happening.  i have no current state of mind. i would try to blog, but i'm feeling very neutral. i'm not much for extremes. i think i'm pretty mello or all-round go-with-the-flow type person. does that make me boring? does that make me vapid? do i have a single thought that's my own? or am i eternally brainwashed by the rest of the world. am i a deep person?  ...Goes to Hades, -Betso

      has anyone looked up at the night sky lately? it's really breathtaking. tonight it looked as if Crapwater was being checked off by the clouds. A single streak of clouds came across the moon. The affect might have also been helped by the fact that I was listening to a song that reminded me of all my friends. It was kind of like that australian guys "sunscreen," but this was a girl talking about the shit in her life and the good things that come out of it. it rocked, but sadly i don't know the name. yay for the song currently known as "Untitled."  K-E-Y...Y because we hate you! *cheesy grin* -Betso

      wah ha ha! i have just figured out that you can use Real One as an Internet browser. how exciting?! anywho, my week has been pretty crazy. this may sound wierd but i've actually had a social life lately...odd.  Graduation went alright. (i got my hair cut. yay!...two days later might i add) i'd like to thank all the people who felt sorry for me. yes, i know i was bawling so you can just drop it. and no i am not confined to a wheel chair and yes i accepted the tissue gladly. grr. why are all my friends graduating? this bites...but anyways i should be alright for 2 months or so. you just watch out for me around August.  graduation night was fun. i played a rousing game of Life with Tabitha, Giles, and Lily. I'm proud to say that we quit and it had a pleasant irony. i married Jude and that was good enough for me. ;)  the rest of the weekend has been filled with receptions galore. i'm getting sick just thinking about it. yuck no more sandwiches or punch. oh god not the punch. they were all lovely despite the punch. mwah to Tabitha, Iris, Liona, and Mona your parties were "jumpin'".  Followin the festivities there was a shindig at Iris' home where East Guh Funk lads and lassie came out for a visit. it was very enjoyable. we played mafia and i find it ironic that if the group picked between the killer and the detective, they would obviously kill the detective. grr. oh well it was fun none the less.  I also had to play for a really pretty wedding. I got the usual comment from Mr Music Man saying that, "Don't you think the music was a little fast?" I'm sorry we don't take every song at 116 bpm like you do. *sigh* that was really the only urksome moment. I played at 11 o'clock mass this morning also. it was fine. not spectacular, but alright. oh well...i have reason to judge my playing because, dang it, i know when i'm good. and it was tough to get up this morning since i was at Iris' till 1am but i guess that wasn't very late compared to some.  today hasn't been tobad. had a two receptions which i figure is the perfect amount. and plus i wasn't hungry so it really made it easy to walk through and just do nothing. p.s my poppy came home with LOTR: Return o' The King. i got kind of mad because my family seems to have a trend with these films. example: we have one vhs, one dvd, and one extended version of the Fellowship; one dvd, and one extended version of the Two Towers; and now to have a dvd of Return of the King...do you know where this is going?...i thought so too.  Diagonally, ah crap, -Betso

      *sigh* my last post from web page. oh i won't miss it much, just the access to adobe mainly. i love that program. let's see what's going on lately. i don't have much to vent about except one thing...  so yesterday in art class i came in and check my fountain (damn fountain) and i swear Namgets told it was fired. so i picked a glaze and started glazing. on my second coat Namgets walks over and says...thi hasn't been fired...grrr *tears* *repress*  so he told me i had to wash it all off so it wouldn't blow up in the kiln. well this really angered me and i came in during 7th hour to wash it resentfully. well while i washed it i just kept thinking of the extra hours i had put into it for what? and as i was washing wouldn't you know it, details fell off. GRRR! so i started to get angry and shake and cry. and then after about an hour, Namgets told me that "we're going to do this the right way"...well great because that's what i wanted to do the whole time. so he has finally let me screw the "deadline" and actually get a nice fountain...hopefully...if it doen't blowup. haha i have a feeling it will explode and i'll laugh, then sob, and then break all the pieces into tinier pieces. i can't wait.  i'm getting a haircut today and i've got three options which i think i've picked my final because of stupid senior picks. my mom doesn't want me to have short hair...but it's so cool. grr. so i've decided on this one (okay so i can't find hyperlink in this new format of blogger) well that bites so the link is - http://gallery.hairboutique.com/default.asp=6370 but i kinda want httpL//gallery.hairboutique.com/default.asp=5884  Plaster is key, -Betso

      oh the joys of a fun filled web page class. i'm done with the FCA webpage so that makes me happy. i have to go to another unimportant day of social. darn my class for being so big. i've been done with my presentation for a week but i still have to come and sit there doing nothing. on the other hand it is a good time to study for my unstudied-chemistry test. joy...  i went to Shrek 2 last night with Tabitha. it was really cute, but i sadly will never look at pinnochio the same way again. *sigh* it was sad to see a carmen elektra add before the movie. i mean there were tons of kids there and they had the nerve to show some of the most inappropriate commercials. ce la vie i guess.  so good news! my computer will soon be redeemed with a new tower. yay! the poor thing can't even going on internet explorer. sad. i ran a virus check the other day and i had 135 viruses. woot that's a new record! but hopefully we can get rid of all that stuff. mr. computer man is coming by on thursday or friday to pick it up and transfer data. i won't have a computer for awhile but hopefully i won't mind much. i'm sure i'll miss blogging...carry on my wayward son.  i'm proud to say i made it through seven receptions on sunday. and my mom had the nerve to make dinner. ahh! anywho i didn't feel so good, so the thought of food made me feel worse. lovely! i also started the harry potter books this weekend. they are really easy to read and happy-go-lucky. i need a break from everything. but i don't know what i could do with it. oh well maybe a HAIRCUT will be good enough! Wednesday at 3:30! hoorah!  Trench coats are so in, -Betso

      so the week went by pretty slow for me. I've had way too much stress lately and lack of sleep made it even worse. i am also to say that everytime i said what day of the week it was i was always wrong. i think that's a major sign of sleep deprivation.ce la vie...it's not just a B*witched song kiddos.   my week consisted of art foes and presentation shit. it all kind of piled on me which was horrible. i finished my fountain yesterday with bitterness. i'm so sick of it and then Mr Namgets started to actually give me advice at the last minute and it made me really annoyed. grrr...he wonders why i never ask him questions. who cares. so in total i spent 10 hrs in the art room this week and still had to scramble to get done yesterday by 4:45. i have a feeling i won't like it when it comes out of the kiln...if it makes it through the kiln. *shudder*  my presentation didn't go to bad. i had to come in early to school quite a lot because of making a power point show but it paid off. i'm really sick of anything to do with Alcatraz. whether it be the island, the prison, the prisoners, the escapes, even the temperature. i had major relief when i went to return the Alcatraz library books. haha i spit at you!  what else have i been up to. well i had a terrible orchestra-brass concert on monday. i don't want to do that again. i had a really good children's choir concert on tuesday. i watched Big Fish in english. i thoroughly enjoyed no matter what other people say. i don't understand how you can't understand that movie. it had a moving plot and it wasn't strange just clever. tim burton's a genius damn it.  yesterday i had a lovely outting with Ambroscious (who will now be dubbed Tabitha) and  Lily and her sis, Mona. We went to Guh Funk and had italian sodas and the usual espressos at the Urb. yay i love it there. We also went to the neighboring "parks" and took some fun pictures. I also found shoes on a telephone wire. yay! there were some cool staircases and a rivendell type sculpture gazebo. it was a good excursion and a good getaway all at the same time.  i had a weird beyond weird dream last night. but that's all i shall state.

      It's been awhile since my last post. i apologize or rather feel bad that people would actually put this blog at high regard. oh well hopefully i can live up to the standard...or not. this is mine and you can't have it! so currently i'm done with dance. i'm feeling relief and yet i totally hate the idea at the same time. marium was talking about how senior company will change next year and that we are losing 7-8 people. it won't be the same again! all those new faces and i'm so used to the everyday ordinary that i love. sigh* i won't cry damn it. i cried all sunday afternoon. i'm proud to say that i'm dehydrated but toxin free. i'm going to miss everyone so much. grrr after awhile i almost felt resentment that they were leaving me, but i soon got over and learned to cope with tears.  I also had confirmation on saturday. i felt kind of dirty because i left early to get to the dance recital. but i know i just would have stressed myself out by sitting there waiting. so it was good. i had a voice solo during mass and my mom said i didn't do too shabby. yay! my sister also got to come see the festivities so that was good.  the saturday performance felt was very happy-go-lucky. everyone seemed good about the show and no major major mistakes. (stupid arms in climb) we've done it so many times it may as well be old hat. there was a cast party at Rochelle's. It was muy bueno; filled with food and laughs. we also cracked open Cranium and Rochelle and I won. wah ha ha. Plato was so jealous :P  on sunday i went out for brunch with my family and my sponsor Carrigan. She made me an awesome afgan. it's so pretty and it's light sage. yay! she also gave me a medallion blessed by the pope. i'm hoping to buy a necklace chain so i can wear it.  after the sunday show i went to a few receptions and gave them my best regards, followed by a cast party at Happy Hoe's. it wasn't so much fun at first just staring at the wall, but later i hung out with Plato, Helen, Rochelle, and Bonnie. We had a wonderful time carrying on and discussing the future etc. sadly i had to slip back into reality and go home and face another manic monday.  What's the matter with her, -Betso

      Well i'm bored out of my mind sitting here in English. I have to wait for a game to get done between Patsy and Cruela. They're taking a while. I've got a 2-0 record right now. i think i'm okay with losing. i was proud of yesterdays victory over Darien. i can't believe he doesn't know the meaning of "synopsis" and "animosity." You'd think he'd have a good vocabulary considering he got a 32 on his ACT. *cough* I'm soo tired. I've accumulated 11 hrs of sleep over the last two nights. that's definately not enough.  I gave blood today. I feel like i actually helped a life, while recieving a free cookie and t-shirt. *wink* I can feel a bruise coming on, but other than that i'm alright. Other news...my car died twice yesterday. Kind of frightening but i'm surviving. i don't think she'll last much longer. I feel bad because she's still nameless.  oh g2g play...

      well i've been wanting to blog for awhile but my computer has seem to contracted viruses of mass profanity. so, therefore i'm using my cousin's "clean" computer to do the job. it's hard to type in the dark.  current news- i've never wanted a nose ring (stud actually) more. we were talking about piercings and tatoos in my english class and i just want a nose piercing and a teeny celtic tattoo. do you think i'd look good with one? well i think when i'm eighteen/not too busy i'll get one...hopefuly. yes! i really like english class because of our little four person posse we have. with darien, kailee, rufus, and me. we don't agree on much but it's fun to discuss anyways. especially music and the future. they decided that i will be a jack-of-all-trades, preferrably on the east coast. i could see that, but something about it just erks me. would i like not having much stability? i don't know. it seems kind of scary to do that, but then again, i don't have any definate interest. am i too floaty?  i went to RENT yesterday. it was really good. i cried again (i'm such a sap for awesome solos) oh well. Collins was my favorite again. it was the same cast from Gah Funk, except for Mimi and Joanne. I liked the other Joanne and Mimi more at Gah Funk. But it was overall very good and i could see better too. Instead of the shadow I saw the actual faces. yay! i was scared to see it with my aunt. she's pretty conservative, and halfway through the first act she figured out that Angel was a guy. *smacks forehead* i wasn't surprised, she's kind of slow with stuff like that, but i still love her. i also wasn't surprised with the amount of people who walked out during Collins and Angels duet. I felt bad. You could tell we were in Conservative Territory. But i'm proud to say that my relatives could take it and understood it by the end and they also thought it was awesome.  hmmm what else has happened lately. well i have never titrated a single thing right :P it's makes me feel bad. we've been doing this for a week and still my record is something like, 0-15. lovely! also, i babysat the penny wars today. i was shocked at how much people chipped in just to get an hour off of school. but that's awesome, it's for a good cause. 9th graders started their 4th mayo jar and our class got it's second. sadly, everyone else is one their first jar. oh well it's really fun to see everyone like the fundraiser. i'm glad it wasn't a bust like a lot of other fundraisers.   well i believe i'm done for now. have a wonderful weekend.

      since it's my birthday i feel like i should have to blog because of the hype of what people actually do on their big day. well i would like to inform the populous that it's not always that special. i mean sure it's good to get greetings and such but i'm not officially supposed to have a huge party...although it was nice to have a surprise at around 10 in the morning.  so my dad consisted of waking at around 7:45am and hang out for a couple hours. it was rather boring. i decided to take a shower and get ready. low and behold in walks Rochelle, Ashim, & Maurie. They brought cake, flowers, and cards. it was fun having cake for breakfast. later me and maurie went to Gah-Funk to do a little shopping.   i tried to return my Game Cube, but they would have ripped me off royally so that was a no go. i was bummed because i had also found out i have a total of -$7.26 in my checking account. :(- x2 so shopping actually turned into window shopping depression. my mom later came and forced me and maurie around the city because she was the one with the cash. she's not one for casual looking. more like "have you found something? why are we still here? put it down!" kind of thing. she also walks faster than me...and you say i'm fast. i did get quite a lot of things but sadly no top for my cool new confirmation skirt. but i found cool blue pants, sweats, dance shorts, sandles, and my "safari shirt."  i also went church *and the angels rejoice* and then i went to maurie's house to shoot the lost scenes of my spanish video. we struggled a little with the on/off button for recording. oh well it's fixed. i'm pretty sure maurie should be sick of me by now. we're together a lot. i don't know if it's because we're close friends or because i'm just a dork who can't be alone. i'd go with #2. sorry maurie ;)  and finally the night ended with chicken strip baskets and the Shack as well as a great performance of "naked ladies" if i do say so myself. me and Ashim rock at that game. we got on the high scores and everything. #3!! score. and so ends my birthday phenomena...

      another eventful day at the humble abode. so i got my senior pictures taken today. i had a lot of fun. Tabitha helped me pick out clothes and that was a lot of help. I had a lot of variety. I got to be outside, casual, dressy, dance-esc, and a piano one later. ooooh.   i feel bad because i couldn't go to Gah Funk tonight, but duty calls i guess. i got through my recital twice. my hands feel like crap, but i manage i guess. i'm excited to get a page turner so i can get through all the pieces without minor pauses. this recital is driving me nuts and it hasn't even started. i know i'm going to shake because, lets face it, i always shake when i'm nervous. oh dear. but there's cake.  anywho, i was thinking to myself as i watched Les Miserables on Sunday...there's a song called Empty Chairs at Empty Tables and it reminded me of high school. all the grads leaving etc. i told my mom that and she was thinking the same thing. it's sad really.   There's a grief that can't be spoken. There's a pain goes on and on. Empty chairs at empty tables Now my friends are dead and gone.  Here they talked of revolution. Here it was they lit the flame. Here they sang about `tomorrow' And tomorrow never came.  From the table in the corner They could see a world reborn And they rose with voices ringing I can hear them now! The very words that they had sung Became their last communion On the lonely barricade at dawn.  Oh my friends, my friends forgive me  (The ghosts of those who died on the barricade appear)  That I live and you are gone. There's a grief that can't be spoken. There's a pain goes on and on.  Phantom faces at the window. Phantom shadows on the floor. Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will meet no more.  (The ghosts fade away)  Oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me What your sacrifice was for Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will sing no more.   AP Marbles, -Betso

      i've been putting off blogging because i have a lot to say and i would rather just not blog about a week's worth of activity. oh well here goes (*smile* RENT lovers)  so on sunday at around 6:15 i went to our local American Legion and waited for the bus which would soon turn into the bus ride from hell. after loading my stuff and taking a seat next to Manerva we settled out on our journey. the bus smelled of burning rubber and gas and no less than 45 miles out of Crapwater it started smoking. joyous. so we stopped along the side of the road. i got to know some people from the "9th District" as we were called. so our bus driver got the belt back on and we proceeded to the nearest town, where we spent the next 2 hours sitting in a parking lot waiting for another bus and a driver to bring it to us. it took long enough and then we proceeded to travel to two other pit stops for more girls and we were on our way.   we ended up arriving an hour late, without stopping for lunch. oh well we didn't have to dress up for the assembly. woot! the week consisted of 3 assemblies per day, city/county meetings, and lack-of-so-called-free time. i was the Chief Judge of Elections for the city of Wa-wa-say. it was fun enough i guess. i liked the caucas stuff more because of debates and such. i wasn't able to hold a real office for the Federalists, but i was a good Parliamentary Procedure person...even though i didn't know what i was doing i still got it. *shrug*  my roomies and i had a good bonding experience. one of my suitemates was the Governor of GS so that was exciting. we stayed up till 4am to help her with her State of the State Address. i had a good time. we also smuggled in pizza illegally...wah ha ha ha ha. it was good. our whole town got along (30 girls) not much drama. i was impressed but i could have killed to talk to someone without so much estrogen, maybe even a little testosterone...heaven forbid *gasp* the whole week people would plug in their campaign techniques when you met them. it was quite sickening. also meeting so many people got to be a bit much. i'm okay with only know 50 people out of 400. so by wednesday i was done being nice and meet new people. i stuck with the friends i had and continued enjoying the week.  we went to the capital on friday. i did the tourist thing and saw the golden horses. my city tried our mock trial and the defense won. (that's me!) i also watched the house of representatives discuss bills. i would have loved to been down there, but i already had an office. boo that! anywho i survived GS or Future Feminists of America as i see it. i'm out of shape because of lack of excercise. *cough* i have nothing to wear because of all the "government attire." my counselor never figured out my name, *woot go Doris* but i met some cool people.  so saturday i went with my sistah to paint an outdoor stage. i could have killed her but i pulled through. all i really wanted was sleep but i was denied. i hung out with her and the boy friend all day. we had lunch and proceeded to go to the Mall of America for no reason. grrr. and then we walked along the lake, but i tried pistachio ice cream. mmm yum! i also got some new books and SAILOR MOON! so i have watched the first 4 episodes but i've got 4 more to go. it's joyous!  i hung out at Amana's place that night. i made a character on some game she had. i liked doing that more than actually playing it. i tried to sleep the night away but was interrupted frequently by Blue and Scout licking my face or stepping all over me. the cats got a little out of hand. so i still have a major lack of sleep. i saw Les Miserables on Sunday afternoon. it was crazy-awesome. i liked there set. you can tell they GET a budget. but hey i'm not bitter.  so i'm at home now. the floors look awesome and my room is semi-moved-in. i've kind of given up on trying to do anything. i ran through my piano songs for the recital...which you're all invited to. i still have to glaze my project and stuff but i don't think i'll do that anytime soon.

      well i figured i'd better put an ole post up for old time sake before i leave for a week. so let's see...what did i blog about last time hang on a ticket let me go check....ok now i'm up to date. so, after tuesday i kept right along with my usual speed reading, piano practice, dance, v-ball, marching band, etc. i also got in a fair game of poker, which was alright. i let the apostles go head-to-head because i left my hand to fate. and she was obviously busy on the other line. oh well i hung out with Tabitha and that was lovely. the boys really didn't get our inside jokes and such, but i guess they never will.  let's see, it's currently Saturday and i'm missing my cousin graduation reception today, which is a bummer because she's actually one of the cousins i kind of like. i don't mean to be rude, but a lot of my cousins are well...i don't really want to go there...anywho, i took the ACT and tromped it. speed reading helped a lot. i got every section done and i read every story in the reading section. yay! so that was a self-exteem booster. now i just have to wait for the results and see what happens.  i also found out that my clay project has made it out of the kiln alive. now i just have to patch it up and glaze it. but i think that will have to wait awhile because of GS and next week i have senior pics, dentist, Giles' sister's wedding, and my piano recital. well, maybe i could squeeze it in there. but my week is packed...  i went to Pamerda today and got a few supplies for GS. Nothing to spendy or anything. I continued packing and have decided that my duffle is a jerk and we are no longer on speaking terms. so, i'm giving up for now because i just have stuff upon stuff. i'm not used to actual long trips. my fam doesn't take many trips other than for the weekend.  so once i conquer my duffle i'll be on my way to GS tomorrow. i'm trying to go with an open mind, but i don't really want to go. i'm not that interested in politics, but maybe it will be eye opening and insightful...maybe not. well it doesn't matter i guess. i'm going. but i always have Les Miserable to look forward to on Sunday. sure why not.

      did ya miss me from the blogging world? no probably not. my days have been alright. not much news just the usual. i had my first dance lesson yesterday. my hips feel like crap *in a good way* and my legs have never twitched so much. but the good news is i haven't lost my hang time. woot!   so now i'm sittin here at home after our first Marching band practice. oh my god do we suck! i have a feeling i will soon despise it and give up comepletely...like i do every year. *shrug* so what if i have no ambition in the band sense.  i feel like an idiot sitting at home doing nothing except playing piano, speed reading, and running. i mean i could be working. i feel like a shmuck for not having a real job. i mean i make good pay, but it doesn't take up much of my time at all. most of my friends are slaving away with 36 hours a week. yes i have 2 hours a week. should i apply for a job? but where. where could i work? i mean sure i'm not that busy this week, but there's always something else to add to it. well maybe another job is a bad idea. *sigh* i don't want to sit at home much longer and it's only the second week of summer. that's pathetic.  well back to my proverbial work. i have to clear out my room for new carpeting and leave aside stuff for Girls State. As well as, bring all my old stuff down to The Holy. Does anyone have a dress i could borrow for GS? *shrug* i'm so unprepared. some how i'll get this all done as well as find entertainment and a page turner for my lil' recital. i'm screwed on that part. i also need to shoot off film and figure out what my "Hopes and Aspirations" are. Anyone got ideas? i need it for the program. ah crap!  sorry this blog was pointless. it was more of a list with explanations. i asked a lot of questions. i hope some of you have answers.

      hey blog fans. sorry if my crazy amount of eerie blogs scared you a bit. minor glitch in my computer. don't worry it took me long enough to delete all of them. so tonight was my first night every playing real poker. i was proud. i got second next to Karl, who will soon become a likeness of his cousin. i may have done some things not up to the level of Karl but i managed.  today i made dinner for the family. it was vegetarian and i'd say it was a hit. i also made a desert called "Pineapple-Mango Ice." It was delicious. I should buy more mangos. I'm sure they are very good for you. They are like a peach, but with a better smell and a tougher skin.   i've decided i will be running alone from now on. i like it a lot better than running with someone else. all i need is my crappy radio and a trail. there isn't much competition when you run by yourself, just your own will power. i consider running a forceful aggression towards yourself and me being a massacist makes this work. i love it! running till it kills and then not walking for very long *repeat for further enjoyment*  so my future is on the brink. what colleges should i visit on my trip? what the hell should i think about pursuing? when am i going to practice speed reading and my piano song? *shit* should i join v-ball? why do i put up with crap?

      *sigh* i feel really good right now. i feel like becoming a gardener and i don't know why. maybe it's all the people out and about doing yard work. i wish i had a green thumb like my horoscopes says i do. sadly i have a gift for killing things that sprout. i am rather proud of my arbor day tree though. it's almost as tall as me and i planted it in about 4th grade. i only got to plant one tree though. mom always told me that she never knew where to put them. oh well. i saved one life.  i went for a run today. made a loop around the cemetary and said a fond hello to grandma and Ginny. It was really nice out. I'm outta shape, but i'm proud to go against all professional ballet trainers thoughts and run. bum bum bum! "i'll never be accepted into the company." oh well i can always be a street performer. yes that would go over nicely.  my minds been going a mile a minute lately. it kind of sucks to be alone with your thoughts especially when it turns you into an insomniac. i miss Lily already but i'm sure she'll have fun on her globe trotting adventures. diddo to the no-longer-foreign-exchange-student Anik. I'm proud of her. She survived Ox Cart Country for a year. She's got guts.  I feel like getting a 9-5 job. i mean everyone else is doing it, why not join the band wagon. i figure i won't have many people to hang out with during the day. my job only seems to last about 2 hours at a time, so i'm free. *sigh* i feel like running again...  56 Spanish Llamas, -Betso

      here i am sitting in my aunt's house when i realize that i must blog. so here i am. i'm done with my college hopping, but me and the mom are still going to hang around for another day. i am so sick of traveling, but luckily Wisc. had some awesome scenery. at least a lot better than the prairie. so out of my visits i have come to the conclusion that i would like to go to a small campus but in a reasonable sized town. ahoy! hooray for actual decisions. i really liked UWS, which seemed open and friendly. it also had a great art therapy program. i didn't like UMD much because of how big it was. i loved the area though. i'd never really seen Delup before and the lake is amazing and the weather was perfect. of course my great aunt pointed out that the weather isn't always this nice. maybe 12 times a year. i kindly told her that i was used to dissapointing weather. as you all may know by now.   Lawrence was alright. it was nice, but it didn't really grab me as a "i should be here" type thing. Mac kind of had the same overall affect. i don't know maybe it's because i'm all toured out and would rather not listen to a student talk for an hour&nbsp;about the many pluses to   *blegh* i'm also out of interviewing mode. i just got back from a crappy interview at Mac. i didn't like the woman much. but the people at UWS and Lawrence were awesome. *go them*  besides such excursions i have been able to do a good deal of thrifting. but i'm still in search of a lamp. i haven't come across a nice one yet. oh well there's always tomorrow. what else...well i've finished two puzzles over the week. one 1000 piece and the other 500. i guess that's what you get when you hang around with this sort o' crowd. ah well i love puzzles. i can even be a bit obsessive about completing, but hey i've got drive.   other happenings -&nbsp;i was asked out to a barbecue by some boy at a pool. that was odd. ummm...i've been deemed the navigator by my mom, who now believes that i might actually have a sense of direction. psssh. what a maroon. *circa 1920s* we haven't done much touristy shtuff, but i have been taking quite a few pics. at least 24. i only have one roll with me. lily would be ashamed, but i'll be alright. tonight my mom, aunt, uncle, and i will be "pigging out" after my aunts weigh in at weight watchers. she's going strong and i guess thursday nights are her time to endulge. we're heading out to Red Lobster for a night on the town. i think i'm going to the lake tomorrow with my sis. i haven't seen her for awhile so hopefully that will go well. and then perhaps see a play. woot!  sorry for all the horrible paragraphing and such, but i know you all can handle it.  How have you touch your community? (interview question from hell) -Betso

      i've neglected my blog quite a lot lately. poor thing. i don't know my writing juices are pretty much gone. and i've pretty much had no writing juices to begin with. well i figure i should blog before i go on my "big trip".   well i was&nbsp;driving home&nbsp;after a night of vow-such festivities and booze. and i'm pretty sure i blocked out about 10 miles of road. now this is really wierd to me since the trip is only 35 miles. i'm pretty sure my conscience reversed into my subconscience and i was pretty much pondering thoughts in my mind. *shrug* oh well i made it home i guess. i was thinking about when i was little...i used to always think the sun followed me around wherever i went. every time my mom drove me somewhere i'd stare at the sun to see if it kept turning and following where i did, and it always did. i don't know why my mom never told me the truth but i'm glad she didn't.&nbsp;so by the time i was done pondering this thought and numerous others i had covered about 10 miles of terrain. crazy-go-nuts.  well my "big trip" starts tomorrow. colleges ahoy! i'll be visiting 4 which was narrowed down from 7. i'm really glad for the cut back considering we took out 1,000 miles worth of driving out of the schedule. i have a feeling my "quality family time" will have reached a limit by wednesday. *shudder* hopefully i can stand it for a week. oh well it's only me and the madre. mi papa is staying home to man the fort and get the post. i probably would have had a much harder time with my dad. we don't get along as well as we used to. i always thought i wouldn't fight with my dad when i was in high school like he and my sis, but wouldn't you know it, here i am doing the exact same thing.  so here i am 11:06pm on saturday. dead tired, not packed, and i have to play for church in the bloody morning. could my outlook  be  that good. i'm dreading the idea of packing for a week since i've already done it twice this summer. it's getting old and stressful. i think i could be losing my mind. i've had a hard time sleeping lately and i can't seem to keep my priorities straight. i also have come to the conclusion that i can't multitask anymore. it's got to be one at a time; with a list. yep i've gone to shit.

      i'm back from a lovely excursion. i've been around positive, proactive people for the past 7 days. i don't think i minded too much. i mean it was nice to get away from the real world and go to a surreal life of team work and bonding. it was wierd to come back home and see my rents bickering and negativity everywhere. kind of makes you think. &nbsp;  so ryla was a blast. sadly i missed the dance because of my sickness, but i don't think that's all bad. i was in a really good family (na-nah na-nah) and had some fun times. surprisingly i was the craziest one of them all. now being around drama people and stuff i wasn't used to this. oh well i think i was impressionable. i guess i had the best sense of  humour  .  (Canadian style)  i also wrote a mission statement, which was pretty pathetic and didn't really say much about me. i guess i could post it on here. we were actually supposed to put it on cds but wouldn't you know it our family actually burned some tunes on ours. whups! oh well it was fun all the same. here's me mission statement, which was written on some scratch paper i stumbled across. yes! &nbsp;  Betso's Mission Statement &nbsp;    I am.    I am a mover and shaker.    I strive for the best in myself and in the world around me.    No one can strip me of my values and ideals    I live each day to the fullest.    My attitude and outlook on life shape my world and the people in it.    I stand up for my beliefs.    I don't pass judgement.    I am an equal. Pride and differences never stand in the may.    I look over and above the limits. No mountain is too high. No task is too great.    My dreams will not be sacrified.    My pursuit of happiness has start now.    I follow my creedo always, with the true spirit of life.      "Work like you don't need the money,    Love like you've never been hurt,    And dance like no one's watching."  &nbsp; Well that's my sap. Of course i never shared it with anyone, so that was the first coming out party. woot! other thoughts -&nbsp;i got my prom dress fabric. very exciting. it will be red with black accents. hazaah! vintage all the way! &nbsp; Loving it, so hot right now,  -Betso

      well i'm am soon to be off to the wild world of RYLA for the week. i've had an interesting week as it is. perhaps my odd sleeps have made it all the better, or worse. i've been asking people what they think of my dreams, but i seem to get the "you're so weird" face, or "are you kidding" face.  so throughout the week i've had a repeating dream. it starts out in the oddest fashion: so i'm in religious education where my mom teaches (nothing alarming since she has taught before)and she has taught our entire RE class a game which consists of 4 or so teams. it has something to do a zipper on the back of a long sleeved shirt...so anyways it's confusing as hell and i zone out. of course. i soon learn that i am on the ugly heather blue team. sadly i don't know where my team meeting is to discuss our game plan. i also need to find the bloody ugly sweatshirt things. so i go along, ask people where i might find my team etc. but everyone brushes me aside/yells at me for not knowing. i manage to stumble across the red team, purble team, and navy blue team. well, to my dismay i walk the halls bitterly and find myself alone in the church living room where i get a vile taste in my mouth. so i spit into a waste basket under a desk. to my surprise it's blood. (tuberculosis anyone?) my mom comes in and seems to brush my problems aside and i sob because i don't know what's wrong with me.   sadly i woke up with a coarse throat and numerous questions on my mind. i asked my mom about it. she thinks i might have actually been wretching while i was sleeping as if acting the part of my dream. (which i have been known to do on several occassions) well that's dream 1 open for interpretation. *shudder*  dream 2 was more of modge podge of random crack. it was really twisted and i found my self with the worst television characters imaginable, including: lizzie maguire (drawing version), homer simpson, the son from Married with Children, and i some how remember the blue door from Notting Hill somewhere in my dream. i don't remember the whole dream just bits and pieces. i know i had to look for someone and also i had to flip a house right side up by standing on a porch railing and fighting the massive waves. does this make sense? no it doesn't make sense to me either.  well needless to say i have had terrible sleep all week. my earliest sleeping has been 1:30am and my latest 2:30am. great! just what i needed to start of a hectic week filled with leadership and never looked at mission statements. haha they're not gonna get much out of me! oh well i hope it will be a bit better than girls state.   i went to the F*squared* yesterday. it was alright. i realize how over rated it all is. i don't know maybe it's because i half the people i ran into there i didn't really want to run into. oh well i know a lot of you can feel my pain. i did however talk to a long time friend from elementary school. i hadn't talked to him since 8th grade. oh well it was fun. he's changed a lot but i can tell he's still the same guy. i remember, his mom practically adopted me and was quite bitter that she never had a girl. other than that the county fair was harmless i didn't play any games. the carnies did not hit on me. *score* and i didn't get sick on any of the rides. i had my first funnel cake ever. not to shabby. but yes it's done and now i'm all faired out and i don't plan on going for a while.  oh ps. my senior pic proofs are in. props to brettness' family for doing a awesome job. i'm having a heck of time pickin' my favorites. though everyone else seems to have their favs set in stone. well we'll see what happens. hopefully i can get some of your opinions.  it's nice not to have to deal with carpet shananigans, but other than that there's still packing and errands to be run, which will have to be done in a short period of time. great! see you all in a week.  Only fools do as such, -Betso

      wilkommen! so i'm back to the blog world after quite a long break, but good news! i have stuff to talk about. nice. so on monday i went on a lovely expedition to Gah Funk with the "Fab 5." well kinda i guess. myself, tabitha, lily, maurie, and rochelle went to the mall, the Urb (for obvious reasons), and the beloved thrift. i got a couple bargains and only spent $8 on actual shopping. woot! i'm learning to cut back on expenses. it's tough. quite tough. actually very very rough. oh well. i'll survive somehow.  on tuesday i had some trouble but it ended out to be a good day. i had plans to go to spidey 2 with rochelle and gwen. i planned to drive but sadly after i went to the bank and got gas my car managed to sputter and die. now wouldn't you know it. as i called my rents from store de gasoline a mechanic walked in and heard my whoas. handy. he took a look at my car, gave me a lecture, cranked up my idle rpms and i managed to get home in one piece. lovely. well i got home an hour later than planned and after i left messages on my rents machine (which they never checked) i was inquiried for about a half hour until i talked some sense into everyone.  my outting was quite joyous. we went rock climbing in the Gah Funk Mall. i think i'm in love. it was really fun and it was kind of a mind game. "only use the yellow ones," "only use the green ones," "right foot stand, left foot over." crazy cool. after scaling the wall we attend spider man 2. i had a really hard time sitting that long. i think i have a slight case of ADD. at least that's what Gwen and Rochelle think. sure i thought about completely other things besides the movie and sitting for 2+ hours was difficult, but i know what happened and i made fun of it to my hearts content. and after our viewing the posse came to my house and we watched My Little Pony. as terrible as it was i enjoyed it. now i realize that my standards were low as a child. and i don't like My Little Pony anymore. oh well there's still Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Jetsons, and Sailor Moon. *sigh*  Shame on, Shame on, -Betso

      Well my week has been packed with mayhem and sand. i went to a miss crapsville meeting. after pondering the thought of being in the pageant for a couple days, i have come to the conclusion that i will not be. therfore, making the whole town happy by only having to see 11 peoples "talents" instead of 12. *shudder* that's a lot of young girls...i mean contestants. *wink* jk.  let's see what have i been up to. well, i've had the usual dance, band, and vball. all is well. dance practices are getting easier and easier, which sucks. marium's kinda given up on pushing us to our limits. she only does the stuff she likes. *shrug* band still sucks and somehow i'm not surprised. vball's gotten pretty ugly. we've had many an F-squared meeting between the team. it's good but depressing to think that i have to put up with the idiot for another year. we had league yesterday. it was fun we won 4 out of 6 games. 2 given automatically because a team didn't show. oh well. we won two. it was a lot of fun. i played left back and right all the way around. enjoyable!  i went to the lake on wednesday being as it's one of two free days i get. it was alright. kind of boring but i managed to get some reading done. i figure that me and Ashim don't have much incommon anymore. she came out with Lindy and hung out for awhile. i wasn't having much fun, but it was good to be outside and on the lake. thank you to Pulp County for the use of their shore!  that's about it. i'm trying to figure out what to do today. i'm free so far...crap that. i'm used to constant on the go, so this is new to me...and i don't like it. plans for the 4th: lake ahoy! i finished harry potter 4 and hope to start number 5 soon. untill then i'll work on the 8 other books i'm reading right now. sorry for the slew of useless information, but i lead a simple life i guess. no constant threats of insanity etc. my blog isn't even interesting to me. i should really just turn it into a calendar and mark things i did. grrr for my lack of creative writing.  Glip glop, -Betso

      well i'm just blogging because i don't have much else to do. i want to go do something active like tennis. if anyone wants to do something call me. i'll be more than happy to play tennis or anything really. as long as it doesn't require sitting and food. blegh. traveling sucks especially when it consists of hours in a car just sitting and maybe eating. well get back to me.  Breaker breaker, -Betso
