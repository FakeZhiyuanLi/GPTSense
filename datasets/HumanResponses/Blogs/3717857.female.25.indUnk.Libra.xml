      We got a supremo camping spot for the 4th of July weekend!  It is at a state park in a neighboring town, and yes, we did have to reserve our spot 5 days in advance in order to get one!  We were going to go to the park in our town, but all the 100+ spots were already taken!  Instead, the park we'll be at is a smaller one, a lot quieter...and  infested  with mosquitoes because the forest and brush is so thick.  So we're currently doing some research on how to keep those pesky bugs away.  But we love camping, and we will endure anything to have our time with the mighty Starcraft.         Still no word about the job!!  It is seriously driving me insane.  It's all I think about.  Will I get this job, or won't I?  Not to sound conceited, but anything big I've ever wanted, I've gotten.  Making the elite marching band flagline in high school, going through intense tryouts for my college show choir and making the cut, getting the current job I have, getting the townhouse we're currently renting, etc.  So pretty much I haven't had to face too much rejection in my life.  And I am scared of how I will handle it if I do get rejected for the job.    I would love to think positive about the situation, but I just don't want to get completely shot down if I do, and end up not getting the job.  If I have some doubts, then it won't be as hard of a fall.  I heart Sex and the City.  Not having cable, I haven't been introduced to this wonder of a show until it started on TBS.  I watched it last night, and laughed so much.  I also gasped so much, mostly because I can't believe they can say "dick" on TV.  And we're not talking Mr. Cheney here either.  Hmmmmm, I think I will buy the first season on DVD, so I can see  everything  I've been missing, not just the edited version.  I'll also be purchasing the Spiderman 2 Xbox game for my wonderful boyfriend.  He's going to be sooooooo surprised!  He was talking about buying it last night, and I talked him out of it.  Hee hee heeeeeeee.  I also have to buy tickets for the movie Spiderman 2 tonight.  Mike says we MUST see it tonight.  (Yes, my boyfriend is indeed obsessed with Spiderman.  It's something I've grown to tolerate.)

      That's right!  I even know the words to that line of the song!  It took me so long to realize what Gretchen Wilson was singing in the 3rd chorus of  Redneck Woman .  Now I know.  It's Bocephus, people!  Bocephus!!  (And if you don't know who Bocephus is....Google it.  You need to know.)  I heard this song waaaaaay too many times this past weekend, but that's all right, because I, myself, am, in fact, a Redneck Woman.  Yeeeeee-hawwwww!  The extended weekend at my mom's was actually really enjoyable, which was surprising.  I have a lot of feelings of animosity for my mom.  For good reason too.    She ruined our family when she cheated on my dad, then proceeded to divorce  him  and blamed everything on him.  She coerced me into living with her instead of my dad, then made me feel guilty as hell when I chose to leave and go live with him three years later.  (I was 11 years old at the time.)  She has bad-talked my dad for years, when he's the only person who kept me sane during my teenage years.  It's my own fault that I never confronted her about all this, just kept it bottled up inside.  But I guess the past is in the past.  Things are getting better though.  When I visited her and her boyfriend, she was a different person.  Not so materialistic, not so psycho and fakey.  She seemed......happy.  It's actually the happiest I've ever seen her, which is wonderful.  I guess I never really noticed it before, but she was a bitch when she was with my stepdad.  Now that she's with Jerry, she's a decent person.  So anyway.....I had a really nice time.  We shopped, toured Jerry's pottery shop, and he even gave me a lesson on how to make pottery on a pottery wheel!  It was so unbelievably fun!!  I made a pot (well, it's actually shaped like a glass), and he's going to glaze and fire it for me, and send it to me when it's done.  If it wasn't such an expensive hobby, I would definitely get into it!  Maybe there's some pottery classes I can take around here.  Jerry would give me lessons, but they are 9 hours away.  Jerry is an amazing potter, by the way.  The 9-hour trip (18 hrs total) was all right and went surprisingly fast, considering.  It helped that my sister came with, and we did lots of gossiping and laughing and making fun of the bad drivers and billboards and all the Texans we saw.  (We weren't in Texas, btw.)  The job.  The job, the job, the job.  Still haven't heard back!  They called on Friday.  I wasn't home, since I was in the process of going to my mom's, but the person who called talked to Mike.  The message was they hadn't had time to meet and decide on who would get the job, but they will definitely get back to me by Friday of this week.  The suspense is killing me!!!!  There is so much riding on this job.  PLEASE, let me get this job!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yesterday I called in "sick" to work.  I stayed home, hahahahaha.  I just couldn't muster up the energy to go to work, especially after being gone since last Thursday.  Now it may sound like I was being lazy, but I wasn't.  I just called in, that's all.  I woke up at my normal time, was ready to go by 7:00.  My day was filled with cleaning, laundry, more cleaning, shopping, and the occasional soap opera break.  I didn't sit still all darn day!  I'm feeling a lot of frustration/anxiety/hopefulness about this prospectful job.  It's to the point that I can't even concentrate on my current job.  I think I've mentioned before, I do not know what I will do if I don't get it.  Happy thoughts, think happy thoughts..........

      Tomorrow is the day that I'll hear if I got the job I interviewed for on Monday or not.  I really do not know how I will react if I don't get it.  Will I be pissed off at the world, an inconsolable mess of tears, or just go on with my life?  We'll see.  But hopefully we  won't  have to see, and they will offer me the job.  It's not the most glorious job in the world.  It's a Training Coordinator position with a manufacturing facility.  Basically I would give all the employee orientations and coordinate all the mandated training for machines, safety, etc.  This factory works 3 shifts, 7 days a week.  The place is never closed.  Ever.  So that means I would have to work an "occasional Saturday" to do orientations.  We'll see what an "occasional Saturday" means when I ask them about it.  If I get the job.   When  I get the job.  Hopefully.  Anything would be better than the so-called job I have now.  Did I mention that of the three people they called back for a 2nd interview, I was the only external candidate?  Yep, the other two people are internal.  Grrrrrreat.    My chances are not good.  But I WANT this job.   Unfortunately, I'm going to be out of town tomorrow, and I won't be around to take their call.  I'll have to check my answering machine messages every 5.2 minutes to see if they called, then call them back.   I hope it is good news.  I want this job so bad it hurts.  Anyway......  The reason I'll be out of town tomorrow, is that me and my sister are going to visit my mom and her boyfriend.  This is a whole other can of worms that I will save for another entry.  They live 9 hours away, so it will be a lot of time on the road.  Between the whole job thing and seeing my mom, I'm full of stress.  So, I'm hoping that's the reason I haven't started my period yet.  Let's hope it's not because of some other reason.

      As quickly as it took to post my previous spiteful, full-of-hatred blog, a smile is now on my face.  When I mentioned to my wonderful boyfriend that I was making one of his favorite meals for our supper tonight, he sent me an e-mail with this bitmap as his signature:       The guy sure does love his Tater Tot Casserole.  And he sure can make me smile, even under the most terrible of circumstances.

      Okay.  I work in a factory, but in the office of a factory in Accounting.  Does anyone else know how extremely hard that is?  Working in the office of a factory?  The factory workers are "slaving away" with no air conditioning, while the "privileged ones" (meaning us office workers) get a desk and a chair and A/C.  Oooooh-weeeeee.  The factory workers have this idea that all office employees think they are high and mighty and above the factory workers.  I do not think this is true.  People are people.  I respect everyone, I've never done anything to make anyone feel inferior.  Our plant manager is constantly feeding the factory workers propaganda: "We wouldn't be anything without all of you factory employees!  You make this company run!"  Well, okay then.  Make me feel like a piece of shit.  Why should I even bother to come to work in the morning?  Maybe I should revamp all my month-end accounting reports and simply scrawl "WE MADE MONEY" on them.  All right, I do admit, I have some animosity towards the factory workers where I work.  Because they are frickin annoying.    I walk by the maintenance department every single day to get to and from the parking lot.  (My Mecca at the end of the day.)  Every darn day, someone has to make a sarcastic/supposed to be funny comment on my coat.    "Why are you wearing a coat?"   Because I want to.   "You won't need that coat, it's gorgeous outside!"   Well, I wouldn't know that, because I work in a dark, dank cubicle with no windows in sight.   "Why are you wearing a winter coat?"   If you had any sense of style or eyesight, you would realize that I'm NOT wearing a winter coat.  One of the guys actually had the nerve to feel my coat, realize that it wasn't a winter coat, and then looked like a total dumbass.  I should have turned him in for sexual harassment for even touching me.    Next subtopic:  The people who say to me every other day, "Oh, I haven't seen you for a while!"  There are many variations to this.    "Oh, you still work here?"  "Oh, they let you out of your cubicle?"  "Oh, you're deciding to be social today?"  "Oh, do you do any work anymore?"  WHAT THE HELL.  I'm sure nobody would realize how annoying this is, unless you had comments like this from various people, at least 5 times a day, if not more.  That's me, by the way.  It feels like crap when people think I don't do any work.  The reason you don't see me every 10 minutes is because I  actually do work  and don't waste time/gossip constantly/screw around.  (Well, except when I'm internet-ing, haha.)  But I really am busy at work.  Doing the job that should be assigned to two employees, instead of one, tends to make one busy.  Working 10+ hours a day gets old.  Today was the last straw.  One of the factory employees, as I was walking through the factory, says to me, "You always look down when you walk!"   What the ^$%&^%(^%$&^$%^#&*^*@(#$&(*@#!!!!!!!!   I laughed and firmly told her that "I do not look down when I walk!".  Which I DON'T.  Who the hell says that to someone?  It's obviously not meant to be a compliment.  It's meant to make someone feel inferior.  When they think that they themselves are inferior.  Which they're not.  But don't tell them that, they won't have anything to bitch about.  How the heck could I walk in a factory if I was looking down constantly?!?!?!?  I would run into a forklift or a saw or something hazardous that would put me in the hospital for sure.  People just plain boggle my mind sometimes.  I wish I knew what was going through the head of an imbecile like that.  But at least I am just writing this out, instead of taking it out on the employees.  I HATE MY JOB.  I HATE THAT IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE PUNCHING SOMEONE'S LIGHTS OUT.  Please, please, PLEASE let me get the job I interviewed for on Monday.  Get me out of this hell.  (BTW, I never, ever swear.  That's how pissed I am.)  Have a nice day.  Be nice to someone today.

      Just had to share: got the cell phone and Share Talk last night.  It's neat to know that Mike and I are in yet another contractual agreement with each other.  Maybe it will give my dad a little more sense of relief....it's not a ring on the finger, but heck, it's a contract.  A contract's a contract.  Here's the phone I got:       The Nokia 6585.  It's a beaut.  It's about half the size of my old cell phone, and right now I have three little pink hearts as my wallpaper, and pink color configurations.  I'm so girly.    I love it.    There are some crazy-ass ringtones though, and I still haven't found one that's loud enough to hear, yet non-annoying.  Right now my ringer is called Treadmill.  Imagine what that sounds like!  Chuckle.  Can't wait to download me some funky tunes.  We have eaten out approximately 5 times in the last week.  My intestines are not enjoying this fact.  Ugh.  Why can't I return to my teenage days, where I could eat anything I want, not gain an ounce of weight, and not have to worry about how my body will handle it?!?!?  Although I have lost 21 lbs. since January.  Down to the wonderful weight of 165.  Go me, go me!  Last night was a good night.  The new cell phone, had Mexican for dinner, had some good lovin' with Mike.  Not perfect lovin', since I'm about to start my period and I feel bloaty and yucky, but it was nice.  It's nice to have someone to be close with.  I don't know what I would do without Mike in my life.  Hearts are everywhere!  In my eyes, my heart (hearts in my heart??), my thoughts, my everyday doings.  Just like the little pink hearts on my cell phone.

      I can tell this blog is going to become extremely addicting.  Oh well, what else do I have to do with my time?  Writing is therapeutic for me.  Mainly because I tend to keep my feelings bottled up inside....I've never been good at conveying my emotions.    That's what makes me and Mike's relationship kind of hard.  Albeit, I am working on communicating more freely and candidly (without hurting feelings, of course).  But it's weird that I am in the "traditional male" role of the relationship---keeping thoughts to myself, not telling my significant other how I feel---while Mike has no problems talking about issues and feelings and emotions, the "traditional female" role.  Is there something wrong with me?  Why can't I just express how I'm feeling in a situation?  But I do realize that I have an issue with doing this, and at least I'm working on it.  Slowly.  But surely.  Of course.  It's scary to think that we might have to go through marriage counseling someday.  All because of my scarred past and issues I haven't dealt with.  I should probably try some individual counseling before I involve Mike in the mix.  He knows almost everything about my past, but I don't know if he realizes how they affect me.  Divorce.  Abandonment.  Rape.  Heartache.  Health problems.  Non-diagnosed depression.  Things I would never wish on anyone.

      1.  My upcoming vacation day from work on Friday. 2.  Mike and I are going to get our cell phones put on Share Talk today.   His  idea.  If that's not a major sign of commitment, I don't know what is. 3.  Discover's Cashback program.  In the form of fun gift certificates.  They're like a little slice of Christmas. 4.  Being so unsupervised at work, I am able to be on the internet 9 hours a day. 5.  Recently discovering the greatness of Sex and the City.  Sure, watching the censored versions on TBS isn't the same, but that's what season DVD sets are for.  That I will be gradually purchasing, thank you. 6.  My understanding, patient boyfriend.  How extremely understanding and patient he is. 7.  Office gossip.  It keeps my mind from rotting. 8.  My three-hour job interview yesterday went well.   Too bad out of the three candidates they called back for a 2nd interview, I'm the only external applicant.  Yep, I'm up against two internal employees.  And this is my dream job too.  Ugh.  9.  The strikethrough function...so I can keep this a happy entry. 10.  The unseasonably cool weather.  Sleeping with an open window in 50 degree weather feels so refreshing.  Try it. 11.  Not feeling (too much) guilt when I had a Big Mac for lunch today. 12.  Blogs.

      ....this is my blog.  Interesting.  I have an online diary (yeah, I like to write), but this is going to be about my thoughts.  Thoughts that race in my head, things I don't really want to share with people I know.    I'm by no means a professional writer, but I do like to write.  Entertain.  What have you.  Here's all the info you need to know about me:    I come from a broken home.  My mom is evil.  My dad is great.  My feelings about the maternal and paternal sides of my family reflect on how I feel about my mom and dad (see above).  I have a wonderful boyfriend.  He saved me from a dark time in my life.  He's so happy and optimistic, and he makes me happy and optimistic too.  We're total opposites in most aspects, but complement each other beautifully.  I have issues with men in my past.  Particularly one ex-boyfriend that for some reason is always lurking in my thoughts.  Always think about what you can't have, right?  The problem is, I don't even  want  him.  Sometimes I wonder why he's in my thoughts so much.  Probably because my life is full of "what if's".  My job is horrible.  I'm currently in the thick of a very frustrating job search.  But the job pays the bills.  That's all it does, actually.  It does not stimulate my mind in the least.  I've never done drugs.  I drank a lot in college.  I stick to my morals.  That's all for now.

      I have a half hour till I can leave my hellhole of a job to go on my lunch break....so I thought I would do some writing.  I HATE MY JOB.&nbsp; This week Mike and I decided collectively that I will broaden my job search to include the whole state, not just this area.&nbsp; By the time I find a job, he will have put one year in at his current job, then he can start looking wherever I find one.&nbsp; Anyone know of any good human resources jobs in Iowa???&nbsp;  Last night I got home from work, and a wave of depression washed over me.&nbsp; I seriously did not want to do anything---didn't want to watch TV, didn't want to eat, didn't want to cuddle with Mike, didn't want to read....and so on.&nbsp; I know it's because of my job.&nbsp; I hate not feeling confident here, knowing I don't have a future here, knowing I'm not appreciated one iota.  If I would have stayed in HR at the current company I work at, I would have my own office right now.&nbsp; I would (probably) be happy.&nbsp; Now I'm out searching for an HR job.&nbsp; How ironic.&nbsp; Accounting sucks.&nbsp; But at least I know now that Accounting sucks.....instead of wondering if I had made the wrong choice.&nbsp; Now I at least  know  that I made the wrong choice.  This weekend:  After I leave work early (hee heeeeeee), we are going to our appointment with a wedding photographer.&nbsp; We'll see how much pictures are going to cost us....yikes....but if we're going to splurge on something for the wedding, I want it to be photographs.&nbsp;   Tonight we're&nbsp;going out to eat and to the movie  The Village  with my sister and one of Mike's friends, who wants to meet my sister.&nbsp; Not feeling too comfortable with that situation, but my sister is all for it.  Tomorrow is the wedding of one of Mike's high school classmates, whom I have never met.&nbsp; But it will be nice to see the friends of Mike's that I have met, and have them fawn all over us and the engagement ring.  Next week at this time, I will be on a flight to Las Vegas.&nbsp; Still can't believe I'm going!!&nbsp; Me, a naive farmer's daughter from small-town Iowa, going to Sin City.&nbsp; It's going to be overwhelming, but I plan on being drunk the majority of the time, so it's all good.  Okay, that did not take up enough time......I want to go to lunch NOW.&nbsp; So I think I will.

      So I've decided to go with that bridesmaid dress, but in cobalt blue.        And I think I have found my wedding dress (sorry for the bad quality):        Things are not going very smoothly though.&nbsp; My future mother-in-law is making things very difficult.&nbsp; Telling people they are in the wedding party before we even get a chance to ask them, telling other people they are not involved in the wedding at all when they are indeed going to be involved..........a lot of lies and a lot of assumptions that she gossips around in her gossipy way.   The worst part was when she told Mike's sister Carrie&nbsp;she wasn't going to be a bridesmaid (which she is), and her&nbsp;telling&nbsp;Carrie that she was really upset about it, because I was having  my  sister and brother in the wedding, and "not Carrie".&nbsp; She should have just come to me.&nbsp; I would have told her Carrie was going to be a bridesmaid....I just didn't want to tell anyone until I had the chance to ask Carrie in person if she would stand up for us.   Mike confronted her about it.&nbsp; She told him he was a horrible son.&nbsp; (By the way, she will NEVER admit she was wrong in doing this stuff.)&nbsp; Then she proceeded to leave town and tell us that we can't stay at their house this weekend.&nbsp; (We have a wedding to go to in Mike's hometown, and we had planned for months to stay at his parents' house that weekend.)&nbsp; She sent him an e-mail saying "We are getting the hell out of here.&nbsp; We are going camping in Wisconsin for two weeks.&nbsp; We're locking up the house, and we don't want anyone staying there while we're gone, so you're going to have to find somewhere else to stay that weekend you're here."&nbsp;   Okay.&nbsp; Who in the HELL forbids their son and future daughter-in-law from staying at their house?!?!?!?&nbsp; The house their son grew up in?!?!?&nbsp; Good lord.   This is what I have to look forward to.

      I LOVE this bridesmaid dress:       I probably wouldn't pick that color though, since my sister and me are both redheads.  (She has auburn hair, mine is more strawberry-blond.)  We wear red and stuff, but I just wouldn't want it as a main color in my wedding.  Some colors I'm thinking about:     purple/lavender    peach    celadon green    light blue    butter yellow  It may be a combination of these colors, as far as flowers and decorations go.  I think I want the bridesmaids dresses to be either purple (not dark purple, not lavender, but a happy medium) or celadon green (which is a really pretty color, lighter than sage green---the lighter green outside color of this blog is pretty close to it).  I think if I get the time, I'm going to make a whole new blog for wedding stuff.  We'll see!!

      Bad news:  I found out today I didn't get that job.  Good news:  Mike  proposed  to me on the 4th of July!!!!  Even though our engagement will last over a year, we are already getting the plans started.  We have the church and reception hall booked, so that means we have already set a date!  August 27, 2005!!    I still can't believe it, I'm on cloud 9.  It hasn't totally sunk in yet, but it is though, slowly but surely.  Tonight we're meeting with my dad and Mike's parents to go over our guest list and talk money.  This should be interesting.  My dad's guest list is over 150 alone.  Mine is over 100, Mike's is about the same, and Mike's parents will probably have over 150.  Needless to say, we will be doing some major reducing of numbers!!  I'm contemplating about starting fresh and making this a wedding journal, or making a whole other blog devoted to the wedding.  Who would have thought I would be doing this?!?!?!?  I was 100% totally surprised by the proposal, by the way!

      Oh my gosh!!!  My friend Jen just called me at work.  Jen is my best friend from college, she's getting married in September, and I'm a bridesmaid in her wedding.  She had been trying to e-mail me all week, but for some reason our e-mail system at work has not been working.    Anyway, she called to tell me that she is having not one, but  two  bachelorette parties......and one is going to be in  LAS VEGAS !!!!    I can't believe it!!    I guess it is her aunt who is planning all this.  There's a package deal where it would only cost $300 for the flight and hotel, and we would leave on a Friday and come back that Sunday.  Jen's asking all her bridesmaids if they would be interested in going.  Of course I'll have to talk to Mike about it...but as a bridesmaid I am obligated to go, right?  LAS VEGAS!!!!!       Jen and I always talked about going somewhere fun....being wild and crazy and carefree....and going to Vegas is definitely a way to do that!  Although we always talked about doing this in college....hopefully we're up for everything this crazy city has to offer!

      I'll be the first to admit, I'm a little impatient at times.  But today my patience (or lack thereof) is on overload!!!  Waiting to hear back from that  stupid  job I interviewed for!  Nothing yet.  If I don't hear something today, I will be calling them this afternoon.  Waiting for this week to be over!  Enough work already!  Waiting for a good time for me to leave work today---not too early, so I look like a bum, and not too late, where I'm the only person in the office.  It's the holiday weekend, and I want outta here!  Waiting to get home so I can get all our camping stuff together, and head out to our camper, which has been waiting patiently in the campground since Tuesday.  Waiting, waiting, waiting.  Let's do some daydreaming, shall we?  If I were to get a job offer today, I would probably want to meet with them in person to ask questions and go over salary and all that stuff.  We would probably do that on Tuesday (after the holiday).  Then Wednesday I could give my 2 weeks' notice, which would make my last day at this hellhole.....July 21st.  Ouch.  Ouch because my boss goes on vacation the 12th through the 20th.  Ouch for her.  Especially since I'm the only darn employee in the whole department, and  she  will be stuck doing the job of two people.  Well, actually THREE people, since I already do the job of two people (someone left and I picked up all their duties).  Maybe I could have my last day here be the 23rd, just to leave on good terms, and have a couple days for my boss to ask me questions and go over things.  (Cuz she has  no clue  what it is I actually do.)  I would like to have a few days in between my jobs, do some house hunting, and just to take some "me" time, but I doubt that will happen.  Unless they would just let me start at the beginning of the month, August 2nd.  Now THAT would rock.  This weekend is going to be funness.  Camping, grilling out, relaxing, going to the carnival, eating corn dogs there, going to the craft show, watching fireworks on the lake.  This is what America is all about.  I also want to take some time to pray and be thankful.  Pray for our troops overseas, pray for our world leaders, and thank them for the freedom we sometimes take for granted.  Also think about my friends Jon and Brian, who are members of the National Guard, and just got back from Iraq a few months ago.  It's been tough for them, and Jon is facing some health problems because of his duty....they are truly heroes.  God Bless America.
