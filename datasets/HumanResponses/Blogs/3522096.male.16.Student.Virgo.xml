      Alright now boys and girls, this one will be short. DO NOT GO SEE "THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW."  It sucked my ass with 8 straws.  It had a good idea, but bad presentation. there was really nothing to fear except for the evil frost, which in all reality is not that scary.  And there were these fake-ass wolves that really sucked ass.  I don't know, maybe you'll like it, maybe I just suck.  If you liked this movie, watch out for the sequel..."THE DAY AFTER THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW: LOOKS LIKE RAIN"  Quote of the Day:  "FUCK is a 4 letter word.  RAPE is a 4 letter word.  LOVE is a 4 letter word.  FUCK is a curse.  So is Love."                                             Augustus Hill  P.S.  I don;t believe that...love kicks ass, i just like the quote because it sounds cool and says FUCK a lot.

      Alright.  Here's the deal.  It's Wednesday, June 2...About 1:47 a.m., and I can't sleep.  So I figure, "Asslee, Rach, Mel, and all the other cool people that I so humbly follow around have those blog things, whatever the hell they are, so I go check out the site and decide that although I will most likely forget to update it too much, I should get one too.  Yah know, just so I can fit in too."             So I might as well explain the name thingy. Tranquillus is latin for calm.  And I, at the moment, happen to be extremely calm.  I know some of you may mock my "stealing ashlee's latin type name stuff,"  But for now, we'll just call them "Hoe Tactics."  Screw you.  Screw all you who mock, because although it would be cool, ashlee did not invent latin...and if she did, she forgot to copyright that shit so...too bad.           Anyway, I feel as if I should leave you all with a deep thought, and maybe a quote or something.  I'll try to do this every time, but I doubt I will. anyway, it's time for...    DEEP THINKING BY MATT DAVIS:    Have you ever just lied in bed at night, stared at the ceiling, and just wondered about the frailty of everything.  Seriously, for some of you, this may be the first time you've seen me tackle a subject like this in a serious manner, and so some may not take me seriously.  I went to a church youth group with some friends of mine, and although most of you think I don't believe in "God," I do.  I may not have the same beliefs as you but I do believe in a god.  I do not agree with most things that are said at churches because how can you take something as important as somebody's faith or beliefs and just generalize it and make everyone follow your rules.  Thats fucking selfish, man.  SO anyway, I was at a youth group, and i'll admit, it was kinda fun at the start.  Even when the leader type guy was talking, I could connect myself with some of the things he said. I belive the topic was "God doesn't care where you've been, only where you're going."  Those of you who know me well, realize that this can most definitely apply to me and my situation.  But then, out of nowhere, dude starts talking about the "end". you know, tha rapture and all that.  And i'm still cool, but then he gets into it that if I don't go to his church, do what he says, and follow all of his rules, I basically go to hell.  I find this BULLSHIT.  No man has any right to tell me what will happen to me when I die.  Thats up to me.  And shame on him for saying this to people there who are easily influenced because it will just scare them into following your religion, and then you are no better than a cult leader.  People who go to church of their own free will...thats up to you.  People who are scared into going because of shit like that...thats wrong, man. its so damn WRONG!  And i'll admit, the thought of "hell" or "the Rapture" and all that left behind stuff...it scares me.  But it will not scare me enough for me to drop my opinions, or change myself to better fit your needs.  My god is a god who doesn't care about religon.  My god cares about how I choose to do my shit, my way.  My god is basicly my conscience.  Its that little voice in my head that I can hold private conversations with.  If you don't like this...don't complain to me, I won't listen to you. In fact i'll probably point out the major mistakes if whatever church you attend...and trust me, your church has mistakes.  So, now that thats out, (wow, that was liberating, wasn't it.) I feel alot better, damn that was cool. this blog idea kicks ass.    Now, children its time for a daily quote...           MATT DAVIS' QUOTE FOR TODAY IS:  Yesterday is a memory. Tomorrow is a vision. Today is a bitch.              I'm here to entertain and inform, and now, i'm out,                                             Matt
