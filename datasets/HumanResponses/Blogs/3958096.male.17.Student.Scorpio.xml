      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People frighten me. Not in the panic attack, pill-popping, social anxiety disorder way most think of being frightened in the presence of others. No, I am afraid of my coworkers because of their sheer incompetence. You're probably thinking that, since I'm in high school, my summer job would be something along the lines of "bun toaster" at McDonald's. In&nbsp;such a setting, my teenage&nbsp;peer working the fryer&nbsp;would&nbsp;probably be less than bright, this is true. However, I work at MCVI. I went into this job under several assumptions: 1) I would be working with mature adults &nbsp;2) Said adults would be well-educated, as they are dealing with important clerical matters&nbsp; 3) I would gain medical experience, as the facility is the leading cardiac diagnostic center in the area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these assumptions were, sadly, incorrect. Although I am technically working with adults, most of them are far from what I would call "mature" role models. Many spend the time they should be feigning work (let's face it, even I don't actually work all the time) droning on and on about pure, meaningless crap. Others, I can't possibly fathom why a respectable company would employ them. I was speaking with another guy (we're practically an extinct species in the medical record dept.) in the lunchroom last week, when he entered into a speech about his inaptitude in high school and how he'd rather be pouring concrete for a living. O.K. . . . Another lady, bless her heart -&nbsp;she tries so hard to do her job right but constantly makes mistakes, leaving the rest of us to clean them up. I can't bring myself to be angry with her, though. It was&nbsp;hard enough to teach&nbsp;the poor&nbsp;old lady how to use the computers. Berating her for doing a poor job would just be wrong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working at MCVI hasn't been all bad, no matter how hard I try to convince myself that it has. There are a few genuinely nice, interesting people there. Beth Kawiecki has helped out a lot - she drops in every once in a while to make sure that I haven't killed myself out of agonizing boredom .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp;or maybe her reasons are less morbid, dunno. There is also a pretty cool doctor who runs the pulmonary testing lab downstairs.&nbsp;I got to see a Mr. York undergo a breathing test and some nuclear imaging, which were enlightening (and a too little violent for&nbsp;an elderly patient, in my opinion). Anyway, he told me his&nbsp;son doesn't want to get senior photos, to which I replied would be a crime. God knows where that came from - usually I hate&nbsp;seeing myself in photos,&nbsp;let alone posing for them like a&nbsp;trained chimp, albeit a well-dressed chimp.&nbsp;Maybe I'm just excited for tomorrow, even though it's supposed to rain. Oh well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do I have anything else to ramble on about? Yeah, probably .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp;hold on a sec.&nbsp;Oh yeah, our shitty 1997 233 mHz IBM behemoth of a computer died on Wednesday. I didn't want to deal with it, so my mom took it to a repair shop on Gratiot to get it fixed. Turns out that the second hard drive we put in about five years ago was to blame, and the technician just had to disconnect it. But then he f***ing proceeded to rehaul the operating system, which, being Windows 95, is f***ing retarded because the thing is so f***ing slow and full of holes that no one will be able to tell the difference! Enough gratuitous use of the f-word? In this case, it was appropriate. All of these further so-called "repairs" were done without my knowledge. The technician obviously knew that he could take advantage of a middle-aged woman with little knowledge of computers. I later, irately, told my mom that the $100 she dropped on the job was completely unnecessary. She wouldn't have any of it, of course, being too proud and stubborn to admit that I was right (and believe me, I don't lie when it comes to computers). F***! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose it's time to wrap up. It's been a long, infuriating week and all I want to do is go to bed. To sleep, perchance to dream. Oh, but guess what I have to dream about? My aunt has gone completely nuts and is undergoing electroshock therapy for depression in a faraway state. My other suicidal aunt is the cook at&nbsp;a girl's summer camp, where the counselors will probably find her face-down in the lake one morning. On top of it all, my satanic grandparents (the ones who caused severe disfunction in their children, as evidenced above) are coming to stay at our house for the weekend. Joy! Maybe I'll just down some cough syrup and "let the whole thing pass me by" as Trapt would say. Nah, I'd never do that, despite the impression this post may have given you. I'm probably the most sane member of the family. That really isn't saying a whole lot, but at least I have something to get me through the day. *sigh*

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You bet your a . . . *yawn* . . . ? . . . Where was I? Oh well. Lately it seems like I do everything for others and nothing for myself. It reminds me of a quote I once read, from Epidicus'  Disappointment  - "It is a bitter disappointment when you have sown benefits, to reap injuries." I try to be a good person, to help those in need, to be as altruistic as possible, thinking that maybe in the distant future I can attain happiness at last. But that, I've finally figured out, will never happen. It's a liberating thought, really. Once you stop yourself from trying to realize the impossible, to make life something that it isn't, you can see it for what it truly is - a means to an end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conversation I had with a friend might be able to better describe the situation. We were discussing the impossibility of space travel, that is, visiting other inhabited planets and communicating with other sentient species. Pretty much all of science fiction is based on the premise that faster-than-light-speed travel is possible. But it's not, not according to the top quantum physicists of our day, including Dr. Michio Kaku (author of  Hyperspace . In theory, if any matter was accelerated to 100% the speed of light, it would be converted into pure energy. To sustain travel at this speed would consume all of the energy in the universe. Poof. Nothingness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then? Maybe that's how our universe started to begin with. Idiot scientists, under the guise of unraveling the truth of the universe, discovered a way to travel at the speed of light and ironically unraveled the universe iteself. Then BOOM, the Big Bang, and our universe came into being out of the remaining singularity of theirs. Who knows how many times this may have happened? Are we universe 1, 1000, or 1 billion? Of course, I'm probably wrong. And everyone else is probably wrong as well. The one absolute truth in the universe is that we will never know the truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the search for truth, religious, scientific, or otherwise gives people hope. Even I consider myself a Christian. I, like billions of others on Earth, want desperately to believe that there is a greater purpose. But faith just isn't enough anymore, not in a world where wars ravage continents, disease slaughters countless millions, and George Bush is allowed to be the president of an entire nation. And so, I choose to push on with the knowledge that knowledge is ephemeral. Life begins, fades, and eventually ends. What we make of our lives matters a great deal because of our ability to comprehend our existence. But after we die, what remains to do the comprehending?

        urlLink     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was, by far, the best news I could have received this summer. The Gov score doesn't matter since I hadn't exactly planned on studying social science in college. In fact, politicans and the whole, meandering governmental process piss me off so much that a 3 is actually a pleasant surprise. A 5 in Chem will be far more useful in the long run. It would be nice to be accepted into Alma's pre-med program with Sophomore status, but for now I'm content with the way things are going.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause love’s such an old fashioned word &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love dares you to care &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For people on the edge of the light &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love dares you to change our way &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of caring about ourselves &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our last dance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our last dance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is ourselves . . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under pressure.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's such a beautiful song, isn't it? Thank you David Bowie for performing it, and thank you Dennis Leary for making it popular again. Hopefully, this week I won't be under too much pressure - I'm done with work for the summer (not that it wasn't an enjoyable experience . . .), school doesn't start for a week, and I'm finally getting some time to myself to read, paint, and do all the things I've been "meaning to do" since summer started. The only thing that's screwing everything up is my parents. They have this annoying habit of taking me to the trailer in Lake, Michigan (no, not Lake Michigan - it's a town called Lake) at the most inopportune times. I have nothing against being outside. In fact, I love the odd walk or bike ride through the park, perhaps a hike with friends, sitting around in the back yard, canoeing down the Au Sable, etc. It's "the outdoors" that I hate - purposefully subjecting yourself to the tired stereotype of rural life as opposed to actually enjoying nature. When will people understand that living out of a crappy trailer on the weekends is not "camping" nor remotely fun? Gah!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here it is:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Binary”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numbers: the foundation of reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strings of zeroes and ones, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designed to encode all that we are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what am I in your eyes?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0100000101101110001000000110000101100011011100010 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1110101011000010110100101101110011101000110000101 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1011100110001101100101 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(An acquaintance?)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0100000100100000011001100111001001101001011001010 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110111001100100 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A friend?)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0101001101101111011011010110010101110100011010000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1101001011011100110011100100000011011010110111101 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11001001100101 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Something more?)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I so conveniently broken down, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Categorized, and filed away, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just another fragment in your mind?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or are we two like those stars, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternally bound? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separate entities, born again as one, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To light the skies.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can still do my little turn on the catwalk. Greg Domagalski uploaded my senior photos to his site today - you can find them  urlLink here . I think most of them turned out great, especially the one with the blue background/birch trees (I even used it for my profile pic). Of course, the 'rents get the final say in which photos make it to paper, and I'm o.k. with that. Wonder if Kinko's makes life-size cardboard cutouts . . . um, because I'm not narcissistic in the slightest  &:^)

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can tell from some of my previous posts that I often get wrapped up in the whole "futility of life" thing. I should really work on changing that . . . but sometimes it works to my advantage. A few weeks ago, I was surfing the net randomly after work when I came across an advertisement for  urlLink Poetry.com . On a whim, I decided to submit the following poem:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ephemerality"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is a pellucid sepulcher &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For futile dreams and broken promises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Departed now, all visage of wonder, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of once conceived on foolish premises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This damned reliquary holds my soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acquiesce to anonymity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever yearning to become a whole, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sordid feelings lack delivery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ephemeral existences belie &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some hope of perfect, fleeting happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality, though, leaves me asking why, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In heaven we still wait for providence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The litany of humankind is love. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is it something we are worthy of?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone in Mrs. Egerer's English class last year will remember this assignment - we had to write a sonnet in Shakespearean style (iambic pentameter), loosely based on one of two themes. I chose the futility of love, which I definitely know a thing or two about. I guess "Ephemerality" is a reflection of my underlying cynicism and, to some extent, my ongoing search for purpose and happiness. At the time I wrote it, I thought it sucked royally (it was just for some lame assignment that didn't really matter). But apparently, the Selection Committee at Poetry.com thinks differently. My poem is going to be published in a collection called "Eternal Portraits," along with about 200 other poems. Also, I'm now eligible to win one of over 100 cash and medal prizes, including $1000 for first place (August 15) and $10,000 for the annual grand prize. Of course, I probably won't win these - they're meant for serious, professional poets. I'm just content with the honor of being published.
