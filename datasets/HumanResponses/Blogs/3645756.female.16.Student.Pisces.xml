      I'm gonna try to keep this short and sweet, but it'll be hard. ;)  I love this man more than anything or anyone else in the world!!  I would surely be lost without him.  I had a crush on him when i was in the 3rd grade, he was in the 6th so i never thought id get to date him.  then in 8th grade i met him again, we dated for about 2 months, and broke up.  after a year which really seemed like forever without him, we got back together and we've been together ever since, and i dont plan on that changing! :-D He listens to me complain (all the time), and he even lets me cry infront of him.  He puts up with me a lot, because im very annoying, but he loves me anyhow, i could not ask for more.  ive never been in a relationship this great....we dont fight a lot, altho when we do i cry because i hate fighting with him, and we're not exactly picky about what we're going to do when we're together.  Apparently God was very happy with me the day he sent Ben my way, because I'm guessing he was my reward...he he...what a prize!!!  this is the perfect love!!!

      Kayla and Angelina are my 2 best friends in the world!!!  They are both like sisters to me, and have helped me so much.  Me and Kayla have known each other since we were about 6, but she moved to a different school and I didnt see her again until 8th grade.  We became best friends our Freshman year, and we've been driving people crazy since.  Me and Angelina just became close this past school year.  Oh the times we had in Health/Gym. ;)  I dont know what I would do without Angelina, she is my guardian "Angel" :)  I would be lost without either of these people in my life!!!  I love you guys!!!!!!

      Do you really want my opinion?  Probably not but that's too bad I'm posting it anyhow...its not like I'm makin you read it! lol  I've been on the Christian forums a lot lately, and it really irks me that no one on there can get agree on anything with a different faith.  The Baptists and Catholics are very bad to agrue among each other, and in my opinion its really stupid.  no wonder no one wants to be a christian, they're seeing how much we fight with each other...no very christian like if you ask me.  we need to learn to conduct ourselves not only as christians, but as adults...if you ever look at some of the arguements..they are very childish. I'm very disappointed guys, we need to act better...if not for eachother..then for the non-believers....because your petty disagreements and childlike behavior are hardly acceptable, and certainly not helpful.

      I am Baptist.  I was born and raised in a Baptist church and I'll die Baptist too.  Most all of my family is Baptist also, except for some family in Ohio they're Catholic...but I don't hold that against them...jk.  I dont't have anything against Catholics or any other religion for that matter...I may not agree with it but I've come to learn that what I think means absolutly nothing to everyone else...but that's ok because it means the world to me...as does my religion...I dont know what I would do with out it.
