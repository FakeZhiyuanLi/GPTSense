      All day today i've had Orlanda nagging at me to dump my current boyfriend Oli; or atleast 2 time him. Thing is, i did ALMOST consider it..but i can't do that..i'm not that type of girl.Plus i would feel really mean. They were all saying 'Go on! He'll never find out, unless you tell him!" :( I really love Oli, Martyn's great..but i just really wish we could remain friends at the moment. :(  Timetable: Double DT - quite boring, done a bit of work on my tie and folio. Maths - Wanted to sit by Orlanda, but Tom and Rachael always got in our way, so we had to shout across the class. Done work on some kind of factorising and numbers. R.E - Practically a joke lesson, the teacher has NO control over us whatsover..so basically everyone sits there doing jack shit all lesson. Me and Emily were laughing;coz i was sticking tissue all over my hands and then we were waving to Richard and Nick..haha! Art - V.Boring, carried on with Bedroom perspective drawings (ANOTHER LESSON ON IT!!! grrr). Me and Rachel chatted about what we're getting Kerry for her birthday. English - Not very good lesson, still working on poems, Miss put us into groups so we could perform them and make them more dramatic, but no one really done any work..i was talking to Matt and Orlanda for most of it..Matt got my MSN addy and me and Orlanda were hugging and kissing each other on the cheek..Matt and Rory were like "......." [basically staring..rolls eyes] lolz  Just watched The Shawshank Redemption, actually it was a v.v.v.good film, i didn't think it would be that great..but i was suprised.  Bye xxx

      My name is Lauren,i'm 14 years old and it has to be said that i have an unhealthy  addiction to spoons and my boyfriend. I like grated cheese (gotta be grated!!), Music (I continuously listen to it, second i wake up til the second i go to sleep), ummm i like going on the computer (i mean, who doesn't!?! You wouldn't be reading this now without one, would ya?!)I also like MSN IM; i think i'm also addicted to that..but i HAVE cut down on the amount of hours online lately [looks worried "course i have":|]. Oh yeah, i LOVE taking pictures..give me a camera (Preferably digital! Delete the shit ones)and i'm occupied for hours! Hmm, does kinda piss everyone else off though..with flashes blinding everyone, every 5 seconds!Hmm, oh well! Tough shitty poo poo!  But i cannot stand townies!! AHHH!!!! "it's alrigh', innit?" Thats all the say!!!  The Common Townie  Latin Name: Wankerous Burberryiteous   Lives: Wherever there's cheap cider (COIDER MAHHHN), and a McD's.   Wears: "Bling bling" Elizabeth Duke at Argos Jewellery (REAL gold coating - "Look Kev, ya can rub the gold off, innit?", DESIOOOIGNER tops (with words on) Copious amounts of hairgel pulling their hair back as tightly as possible (female), shaved head (male).   Likes: Cider, smoking, spitting   Dislikes: Black, work   Can be seen: Pushing a pushchair with their kids in. In the back of a police car (best place). Outside McDonalds.   Rarely seen: At school. At the job centre.   AKA: Kev, Chav, Shaz(za), Baz(za)   Joke: How do you starve a townie?  A: Hide his dole book under his work boots  Kev: "What should we do today mahhhn?"  Shaz: "Same as everyday - get some cheap coider n be twats outside Maccys!"    Just like to thank RSK for that perfect example!

       If i see these walls for much longer i'm run downstairs grab the extension lead and hang myself from my grans balcony!!! I'm sooooo bored! Can't go out anywhere cause mum doesn't want to be left home alone with the builders/plasters.      &nbsp;  I need to do something: Shall i hang out with my friends (hmm, think not)   Amy- Don't really like the people she hangs out with plus at the moment i think she's in Northampton, seeing her cousins.    Kerry- She stays at home most of the time. (Plus if we met up, wouldn't know what to do)   Rachel-Always hanging out with her boyfriend now, or on other occasions..gets stoned and drunk. (not my idea of fun)   Verity-She lives too faraway to call on her and if we met up, i have no idea what to do.   Orlanda- In Australia.   Alice-God knows what shes doing.   Matt-Same, plus he lives too faraway.    &nbsp;  Dum..de..dum...la..laa..laaaa    &nbsp;  Anyways only 4 days til i'll be in Surrey with Oli! AHHH!!!!! I'm sooo scared, i don't want to go but i do want to go. : AHH!! Am i making any sense?:S    &nbsp;  Soo..another day stuck at home!!    &nbsp;  No TV cause its all been packed away cause the living room is been plastered n done up! :'( Stereo is screwed up! (Need to buy a new one soon)..so i'm left with the internet. :( Meh, i seem like a saddo..but if i appear offline for most of the time..no-one will know i'm here.    &nbsp;  Hmm, posted a good message on newsround yesterday..i will post it here. I'm quite proud of it, hehe.    &nbsp;   If you aint got nothing nice to say   ··¤(`×[¤©ø®ní§h_þí×í€¤]×´)¤·· - 3837th post - 26 Jul 2004 19:37   then say nothing at all.     I don't think any band around now are terrible or poor.     Every band/singer has its own style and some people just don't agree with it and like it.     I know that everyone has their own opinion on stuff but i just think that you shouldn't go around dissing stuff for the fun of it.     Many say that Busted and McFly are terrible but on the other hand, many say that they're the best bands around. I used to be a huge fan of Busted (even saw them in concert), not anymore though..but everytime i see a msg that says 'I HATE BUSTED' i dont join the bandwagon and pick arguements with everyone who disagrees.     I just think that everyone should respect every band for having their own style (even how similar to other bands they may seem) and respect every music lover for having their own taste.     &nbsp;  Its good we're all different and like different types of music, or else this world would be very dull indeed.    &nbsp;  Anyways..toodalz! xXx    &nbsp;

       You gotta think about something to stop you going mad.    &nbsp;  I don't wanna hear about ex girlfriends,long distant,you without me,the past,&nbsp;money worries, change of money notes (wtf!), fueds with family members, prescriptions (eh?!?), illnesses. Do i honestly sound bloody bothered? (Oh yeah, i can hardly contain myself with all this excitement...listening to all this fascinating useless information which is just clouding up my mind.)     &nbsp;  Cupid are you taking the piss? Sitting there with your bow and arrow, stabbing it through peoples hearts, only to screw up their lives and make them think of nothing else! I&nbsp;can feel myself getting more jealous and jealous...you go on and on. Ok, i may of seemed bothered at the start. But NO MORE! I know you've already pulled her, go to the same school as her, flirted with her non-stop in France (whoop-dee-doo..france, very exotic), see her practically every second of the day. But listening to all this, isn't good for my health. You wonder why i get so suspicious, it's like you want somebody else. My trust has already been lost once in you, my hearts already been torn apart and scattered into a thousand pieces. I gave you another chance..one minute i'm glad i did it..the next i despise myself.    &nbsp;  There is just something about you, one moment i love you..feel in the mood. The next i wish i had nothing to do with you..didn't even know that you existed...but you can't help who you fall in love with i guess.    &nbsp;  Is everybody taking the piss?!?!?! One minute everyone is screaming at me calling me stuff and the next your buying me whatever i want! I don't bloody get it! Everyone has their own doctor, i think its time that people actually started visiting them. Maybe one day everything will start making sense to me, cause at the moment..i feel as though i'm having a blonde moment.     &nbsp;  Judgement Day is gradually nearing closer, the minutes, seconds, hours are decreasing. Will a fair majority of 2004 been a waste of time and emotion? I guess, i will soon find out. I'm scared about it, but also excited. I mean i've declared my love for this person and now i'll find out whether i've been pissed about and made to look like an ass.    Anyways, back down to Earth. My mother?! Has she been prescribed some kind of freaky shit that sets you off shouting at every poor buggar every 5 minutes. Wake up in the morning "Morning Lauren"..  "What the fuck are you doing now!?!?! You always gotta mess everything up!" Me equals "Huh?   I only put the television on.:S" Oh well, maybe its a mid-life crisis and my mum copes with it by shouting and nagging at everyone. Oh yeah, daddy-o..when the hell did he mind me listening 2 my music? Ok, let me re-phrase that question. When did my father let me listen to my music late at night, on full blast...listening to stuff like Blink 182, Lostprophets,Nirvana, Nickelback and pretty much every other band i like? It's a known fact that my father would rather have red-hot pokers stabbed in him than listen 2 my 'fucking shit' (as he calls it). The world has gone mad, i don't get it!    &nbsp;    "Everybody will always want somebody else"      &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Well since I last wrote in here, quite allot has happened. Nothing amazing, but interesting enough for me.  I’m meeting up with Oli! Yay!!!! I’m SO over the moon about that, v.v.v.v.v.v.v.happy! That’s gonna be happening on the 31st of this month, so only 20 days left. That day also happens to be the same day as my grandads 80th Birthday Surprise Party. Haven’t seen him for about 5 years, also be seeing the rest of my family (from my dads side..woah, I haven’t seen anything of them for about 10 years!! Eeeek!!)   I got off with this guy that lives near me, that was a bad mistake. But oh well, I hardly talk 2 him anymore…not my type at all.  Think I mentioned that in one of my previous posts..but anyways, I think he’s interested in Rachel (hmm, don’t ask my opinion on that). I’m not jealous or anything, but I just don’t get why..she didn’t tell me in the first place, that she was meeting up with him and getting up to allsorts with him. I mean, I don’t care for him (not in a loving way at all)..i’m totally devoted to Oli. But like, why lie? And say your bunking off school doing others..i mean, the others knew..and I just looked like a right fool! L Now, she’s annoyed..coz I mentioned that he’s been hanging out with Orlanda til like midnight some nights (while she   was away on holiday)..and now she’s confused about everything…if I was her, I would of never gotten involved with him. Well, I mean I did..coz she only knew about him through me..but I wouldn’t of done all the things she’s apparently been doing with him (and she like hardly knew him anyways).  Went to Kez’s birthday do last Saturday, she just went to the cinema (nothing major)..saw Mean Girls. Such a great film, made me wanna become more bitchy!  We were sat at the back and Matt knocked his drink over..it went everywhere..it all like rolled down right to the bottom on the screen..everyone was like.. ‘ewww, its all wet’ haha! Me and verity made a joke that everyone would be dancing n singing in the coke..also like jumping in the puddles of coke. Luckily we didn’t get thrown out or anything.    Then in the evening, went to Verity’s house warming party..slept the night there too. Emily also stayed the night. We were outside most of the night, Em n Vez were playing Badminton (I’m the worlds worst badminton player)..so I just kinda sat there drinking all night, singing and listening to music.. hehe..i must have had about 50 drink altogether! Hehehee..  Next week, I have curriculum enrichment week..going to this aquarium on Monday, then staying in school..doing some kind of creative stuff for the rest of the week. Then after we go back school on the 19th, we have sports day (whoo L)..then yay!! On the 23rd..last day! Hmm, I’ll be a year 10 in September..eeek!!   Well nothing else to say, 20 days!!! Yay!!!!!!!  Lozzy xXx
