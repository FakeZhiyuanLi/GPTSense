       i felt really encouraged in piano lesson today.not that encouraged lar,but i felt somehow refreshed n enjoyed myself n also managed to elarn at e same time.isn't that cool?i juz luv miss lew,she teaches me so much spiritual stuff besides piano.she's lyk a 2nd mother to me n her lessons are interesting.i really thank god for her.he somehow answers all my qn to him thru her.yeah.that's for today.   i seriously don't know how i'm gona pull thru e week.already i look forward to e weekend.well,at least my two exhausting days are over.but sitll,if i'm not in some remedial,i'm in tuition or at home trying to study n get rest.dis lifestyle sucks.its not healthy for me.i can't live lyk dis.to put e cherry on top of everything,whale pops out at me everywhere.in my textbook,my stationary and most of all my mind.somewhere in that corner will be a part of me wishing that he likes me back.that i haf a chance. that we're together.but of cos e other corner of my brain will be lyk telling myself to stop dreaming.   somehow,i juz can't stop e memories from flooding in.those wonderful times wif him,u noe?though to him it was juz normal,lyk meeting a sister.but to me,they meant something.e time we met to go alvin's hse(that was e start of everything),when he walked me home,when we watched last samurai,when he taught me physics blah blah blah.so many things.but memories will always remain as memories i guess.its no use thinking of e past.but sometimes u juz can't help it ya.*all e memories so close to me juz fade away*i hope they do,well maybe not lar.i oso duno.i dun even noe how come i'm in dis pathetic position.it juz hurts lar.yeah,whatever.i dun care.not going to.

       i went out to study wif lene today.amazingly,i managed to concentrate 100% and i did lots unlike yesterday when i went to orchard to study wif audrey.we both ended up talking and decided to go shop n take pics instead.heez.but i had lots of fun yesterday.saw dis eurasian twins.sooooo cute.but whatever lar.i really had a great time catching up wif drey n shopping,i missed paragon a lot so we went there.sooooooooooooo nice.heez.    anyway,today lene n i went to e airport to study  n at abt 530 we went to orchard n took pics n shopped.it was so nice.we talked a lot too.i had so much fun.it was lyk i managed to study but oso manage to shop at e same time.yeah.   anyway,we were talking.its lyk everyone thinks that we're attached and that is so annoying n depressing when its e guy we lyk who tink we're attached.everyone out there think that we haf perfect rich boyfriends n that we're bitches who only care abt looks n money.shallow pple.but well,although looks do play a part,but i guess we've both learned that looks are not everything.there are other more impt things in life lyk e character.i wonder what we can do to change e impression pple haf of us.pple think we change our boyfriends lyk clothes n that we haf no feelings,that we're not serious about anything n that life is one huge party.well,life used to be one big party for me but its not anymore.after somethings that happened,i tink we both learned a lot from there.life isnt a party,there are things in life tat we are serious abt.take studies,i do care abt my studies.and i haf serious feelings for guys la,i dun change e guy i lyk everyday.how i wish pple could get that into their thick skulls.   argh.i juz saw cola online.sometimes i wonder how its possible i can lyk two pple.actually its not really two pple.but ther's sth in cola that juz attracts me.i duno what it is.anyway cola said that he wld msg me when he was back in singapore.but he didn't.guys n their empty promises.juz by that single gesture,he managed to make my nice day turn sour.i wish guys could juz remember their promises for once n actually fulfil it.they do not know how much gurls actually their word at it.yeah.lyk when whale promised to call but didn't.it jus hurts la.yeah,whatever lar.   i'm getting more n more annoyed wif L.she's totally annoying me.she keeps glaring at us n its not scary at all la.its super irritating.wa lau eh.i wish she could juz get lost.so extra.plus she's so fake.argh.shes juz so different from e gurl i used to noe.i juz dono how to be nice to her anymore.i give up.i'm not gona try being nice anymore.

       its not easy to see me sad..most of e time i'm either angry or happy but not sad.i dont cry over people or anything but yet on sunday night i cried over him.i feel so damn silly for crying.crying doesn't help matters at all.its so dumb.i feel angry that i cried.i'm amazed that he can make me cry.and so angry too that i gave in n cried though only a short while.but i felt so helpless over e state my life was in.e way i treated God and e person i was turning into..didnt really care about pple feelings except those who meant alot to me..being so darn bitchy n mean..i duno..juz feel so disappointed in myself..i was backsliding n drifting away further from god even more each day n e scariest thing was that i didnt noe it.yeah.i really hope i can put my life back in place.   sometimes i feel so frustrated.pple out there think that i have dis perfect life with a perfect boyfriend and perfect rich parents.but my life is anything but perfect.and i dont have a boyfriend.i cant even get e guy i want,let alone a boyfriend.haiz.i duno..been feeling so down this few days.eva since sunday.yesterday i had tuition wif lene.in school,i told fab n angel abt whale.in tuition,i told lene.it felt so nice cos at least there were pple who understood how i felt about whale and it was nice knowing that my frens would always be there by my side.and i esp appreciate jonah for being there that night to console me.i really thank god for sending such wonderful frenz.yesterday in tuition,i realised that lene was feeling e way i was.somehow we always end up in e same boat.e guys we want we dont get,but those we dont want keep appearing somehow.argh.i juz feel so confused now.he messaged me last night..and juz when i thought that maybe i could lyk juz not tink about him,he had to message and make me feel as if i had some chance.i duno.i felt both happy and sad when i read his good night msg dis morn.happy cos at least he msg but sad cos i had to give him up,in some way or other.i duno how i'm going to,but i have to.if not i would only be hurting myself and that's not good.i nid to stay happy.ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.   oh ya,i'm so pissed off wif hx.i duno y but she juz manages to piss me off.sometimes i tink about e times when we were lyk so damn close n i feel sad that we drifted.but now,she keeps being so fake and all.i duno how to explain.but it irritates me.yups.i hope i get over e irritation.   okay,that's about all i can think of to write here.i've gtg.must study!!*puke*bye!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bern*whale

       he was so cold to me today.i wonder why.argh.my only wish now is to forget everything and move on,to erase him copmpletely from my life.but..its so tough.how do u forget someone who's been in ur life for over a year.yeah,sometimes i'm completely amazed that i could lyk him for such a long time.esp when its me.someone who can lyk a new guy every other day.but i guess after shawn,i learned how to really lyke someone..not just for a day or two.but for a longer period.should i forget him..or not?that's e only question in my mind now.to continue liking him would be torture,to give up on him now would be pain at first but beneficial for me in e end.i'm not ready to give him up yet i guess?after putting in so much effort in liking him,how can i bear to give him up like that?i've changed quite a lot for him..i've never taken so much initiative for a guy.at one point i thot i had forgotten him..but now i realise its not that easy.well,anyway enough about him.   i took two neo prints today.one wif lene,divid n abra.another with andrew,gazel,josiah and dominic.it was soooooooo fun.hehe.though i hate e smiling part.i juz lyk to decorate it.yups. :) i'm kinda looking forward to school tomorrow.can tok to fab,angel and xing yi..hee.i juz love them all.

       him.e person who taught me physics.e same person who made me lyk physics.e person who made me wana grow in e lord.e him who made me fall in love wif  drums n guitar.e same person again who made an impact in my life.he who made me cry.e him whom i fell for for over a year.. e him who i didnt get in e end.whale.   isnt it amazing?i can get almost everything i want in life except those things that really matter to me n that i really want,i cant get.or rather e only guy who really affected me so much i cant get.people out there think i haf a no problems wif guys,i get any guy i want.but..i didnt get e only guy who really mattered to me.e him who i mentioned.   he really touched me in many ways n taught me many things abt life.i dun tink he evn noes that he matters that much to me.but he does.really.e way he looks so positively at life really teaches me a lot.n e worst thing was that he said i liking him was only an inffatuation?i dun tink so.i noe myself best.i won't lyk a guy for so long.its not easy for me to lyk someone so long.juz ask my frens.they''ll noe.yet i haf liked him for over a year.of cos there're parts where i try to lyk other guys but in e end its still him.e him who really matters to me.e person who thot me liking him was only an infatuation.that really hurts.seriously,i duno what he did to me,but i juz feel that he really hurt me deep inside my heart.deep down a wound that i wonder if it'll eva heal.sometimes during e week,i feel so happy n i start writing whale all over.i feel that mebe i do stand a chance if  i'm persistent.but other times lyk today i juz feel as if i hafta give up.i mean pple do give up sometimes don't they?i'm a person too.i get tired too,but i won't give up.i dun tink i eva will unless he likes me back..someday.that day someone told me that a couple got together cos e guy was persistent.it encouraged me.but how long can dis go on?   haiz.i'm at a loss.giving him up wld be pain,liking him would hurt.either way i lose.so what's e point of it all?juz leave things be i guess.but its making me into a bloody cryign idiot.tearing eveyr sunday.i mean how disgusting is that.i absolutely hate crying la.haiz.n my chi results were really a blow to me.it makes me wonder what e pt of studying is.i studied for my chi,more than normal.but i only got a 4.so if i can dis sorta results whats e pt of studying?of trying to get into a jc?is there any pt of anything?a sense of hopelessness overwhelms me.i duno whats e pt of everything anymore.there's nth interesting except slacking in life.n i hate whale.but at e same time i really really lyk him.i hate him for changing me into dis cryign idiot.yeah,whatever.i dun care.

       i did something crazy yesterday.i finally admitted to whale how i felt about him..and yea,i think he was kinda shocked though he said he wasnt.he was really mature in handling everything and somehow i didnt feel anything.i juz felt so damn numb.no feeling at all totally.it was kinda scary.but i'm really thankful for e support my frenz gave..yeah.they were really encouraging.yups.today when i first saw him b4 speedlight i felt so wierd.i gave him dis fake smile n turned away.den i started to feel sad.during seedlight praise and worship,i kept hearing his drums and i nearly cried.i felt so depressed.e reality of what i did finally began to sink in..den after sl i wanted to shake his hand and wish him happy bday but i couldnt bring myself too.i juz passed him e card w/o looking at him.i was scared i broke down in front of him.ya.lene said he asked her what happened n tat he said he was very touched..e moment in e office was really awkward.i juz didnt noe how to react.yeah.but i regret not shaking his hand.its juz that i'm scared it wld bring back memories of e time when i first liked him.yups.i think its finally time for me to really move on and put e past behind me.those happy memories together..memories will always remain just memories so its no use thinking abt it..yups.i think i'm fallign sick.i keep sneezing n coughing.e thing is that i wana fall sick.i dun tink i can stand going to sch tmr.mebe i can lar.but i'll be totally depressed.and i think i really nid e rest.i'm so sick of studying n my piano.haiz.i'm beginning to feel very sad over him.e numbness has finally gave way to sadness..when i looked into his eyes today to say hi at e coffeeshop and when i accompanied gazel to get her cd n said hi to him too, i really couldn't stand it.i either turned or walked away.those same eyes i haf always stared at when talking to him really made me feel so bad.i could see that he wanted to tok to me and that he was trying to act normal.i wanted to act normal too but how to act normal when its e guy whom u've liked for over a year?i really can't stand looking at him,it juz pains me somehow.i really wonder if i'll ever forget him.lene said to juz push him outta my mind n forget everything though its impossible.i want to do that but yet at e same time i dun wan to even if its for my own good.yeah.i cant go on anymore if not i'll start crying.-love ya.
