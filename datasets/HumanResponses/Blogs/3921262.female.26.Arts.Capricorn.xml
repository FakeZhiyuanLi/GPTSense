      so where do i get off being so self-righteous. at twenty-six, i feel slighted by society and i deserve more! i was raised in this society that bred this generation to demand more. the liberation of gays, blacks, women, minorities in the 50's-70's (there i go, decade-ism once again.. let's wrap everything into a clump of ten years and smooth it over with an adjective.  "i like the pretty packaging. did you get this wrapping paper at pier 1?" ) has swung ass-backwards. the pendulum is coming back this way, and my feet are planted firmly on the ground. not to be swayed!! only, the rest of my body is being blown by the force of the demolition ball. it whizzes by my head and the essence of pissed off drag queens and fire-hosed black people comes with it. i can smell it. i can taste it. sometimes when i get a nasty look from a grocery store clerk, i think i might even being able to feel it.   but alas, i never have. and with the way things are going, i never will. thanks to  urlLink Harvey Milk ,  urlLink Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon ,  urlLink Leslie Feinberg , and especially the  urlLink Stonewall warriors . and the thousand others that literally gave up their lives so that one day some rainbow-pin-wearing, blue-haired, pierced and tatued lesbian can walk down the street in Minneapolis and feel like she has a right to be herself. no, she is OWED the right to be herself. and fuck anyone who dares try to take that away. she deserves it.   urlLink Thousands of people died  so that i can choose. it doesn't matter what it is that i choose. the fact is that the choice exists. we don't think anymore about what it means to be free. we think we have it so bad. life is difficult for us. but it's a sweet life compared to fifty years ago.  the bloodshed is on my soul, and i honor them with every public kiss. i will not tread lightly upon the work and pain of others, in their push to better my own future.

      here is my prophecy for the coming election and its aftermath. i suppose "prophecy" leads you to believe it's coming from a higher power. this is not so. i couldn't think of a better word. it's just from me being a human being, paying attention to politics in this country.  bush cannot afford to have another "9/11"-type incident before the election. it would prove that for all he has done since the original 9/11, he still has not kept this country "safe from terrorism".  (of course that is an imposibility, as Bush is  urlLink terrorizing  his "flocks" every day.. but back to the topic at hand)  He would lose the election in the blink of an eye. so he will raise the threat level, as he has done countless times before. he will keep this nation under his blanket of fear. he will get  urlLink (and it happened today)  more specific about times, places. but nothing will happen, dear readers, before the election. he is keeping you afraid enough to vote for his " urlLink leadership " , but not allowing the " urlLink terrorists " to strike actual fear into your hearts.  i can almost guarentee that if john kerry is elected president, george bush  (or the cronies working his pullstrings)  will most definitly create chaos. either by completing a "terrorist" mission themselves on a national morale landmark, or allowing the radicals to do so.   urlLink that's what we get for allowing a person like him to lead our country.
