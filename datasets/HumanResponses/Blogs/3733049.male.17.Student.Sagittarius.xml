      Every senior at what is now my former school, Fordham Prep, was forced to complete 70 hours of "voluntary" service. Those who did not complete this amount would be punished by not attaining their hard earned high school diploma. Service even became a class that usually met once a week, keeping stressed and busy seniors somewhere useless and unproductive. At the end of the year, to fully complete the service project, we had to write a service essay depicting our feelings about service and what we learned because of it. I could have very easily bullshitted the whole thing saying things like, " Service is a growing experience, one that should be taken by all youth. Blah Blah Blah" However, I didn't. I vented and aired my opinon and sent this exact essay to my service teacher.    Yet Another Bright and Cheery Service Essay    Upon first hearing the words service this year I cringed. I remembered junior year when we were forced to do fifteen hours of grueling service. It seemed as if Fordham Prep had developed the service program to provide free labor not only for their own social events but also for others in order to glorify its own reputation. Now with a ridiculous seventy hours to fill, the task seemed to be a way for the Prep to entrap seniors with busy time, preventing them from doing anything truly productive. Nonetheless, I did go into this service project with an open mind having an inkling of hope that this would be a fruitful experience for me. How wrong I would be.   When choosing a service project I was very picky. I did not want to serve at a nursing home because I had done that before for my elementary school. I can still remember the sad, pale looks of what were once people but had now become the living dead. Some say that you can’t see death but I remember seeing it well. All I had to do was look into one room and see a frail old body laying comatose on the mattress. Walking down the hall I could smell the stench of not urine or feces, but what surprisingly only could have been dead skin cells; I could smell them dying.   To prevent exposing myself to this nightmare again I chose the logical route and decided to do service with young people. I remembered how happy when I was younger I was , so full of energy and excitement. These children would be much less depressing than the cadavers that filled the nursing home. I provided my voluntary service to Visitation Elementary School in the Bronx and soon my optimism would be crushed. I looked out to the crowd of busy little bodies and had my memory jolted ; elementary school was horrible! I remember toiling away my energy hoping for the time to pass and waiting for the sweet embrace of a Saturday. Let alone the painful stay they had to endure for eight hours, this was after school which meant even more work. Yes, I took great pity on them. I wanted to scream, yell, and free them all from this penitentiary. I wanted to tell them that nothing that they were doing now would be of importance later on. That they were only separating themselves in a cruel social Darwinist fashion as children! Children for God’s sake! If they are unsuccessful in their time here they will be deemed as failures and then be treated like failures for the rest of their lives. They will go on, continuing the cycle of degradation to a poor high school, poor college, if any, and then a low-income job with long hours until their offspring can hopefully become deemed as “bright” or “smart” and break the vicious chain. If not, another futureless victim is thrown out into the spoils of the world.   The school system is not a means of education but only an advanced babysitting center where the “good” are separated from the “bad”. Then something dawned on me. I realized my time at the prep was almost no different from theirs. I asked myself, how free am I? Not free at all if I was forced to do this “voluntary” labor. Then I went on to ponder the college institution, will I be able to break the bondage by attending a college or university? I reminded myself of working arduously over silly, trivial papers and taking the SAT’s in order to separate myself from the rest and be deemed acceptable to colleges. I was attempting to please and find acceptance from people I never met before, what the fuck was I thinking?(This part has been added, im not gonna curse in a paper if I hope to pass) Came to the revelation that, like everyone else, I was just comforming to the social structure that our nation applies by. This is where I realized that I will never be free of bondage; that most will be bound to this status structure. This was the only positive that I attained from service, this little scrap of depressing enlightenment.   If my feelings about service are not implicit then here is a summary. Service is bad. Service is bad when it is enforced for then it truly is not ,in the Jesuit definition, “service”. It should be correctly termed as slavery. At least this way, students will fully realize what they are being subjugated into. You might think that I want to do away with the service program. How wrong you would then be. I support it fully. With me now having completed my obligation to Fordham Prep’s Service Program I feel no compassion towards the underclassmen. A prep school is supposed to prepare students for college and life in general. By performing these acts of servitude, sadly, does. Sadly, it does.   Further note: I somehow got my diploma even with this rebellious "fuck you" essay to my school. Speak Out, Be Heard, Fight the Power, and all that other good stuff.

      I wrote this essay about the harm of fast-food for my college course months before Morgan Spurlocks film, "Super Size Me", hit theatres:   	There I stood on line at the local McDonald’s with the pangs of hunger shooting through my body. However, as my eager eyes gazed into the kitchen with anxious intent I suddenly came to a realization that I had not come to before…what I was actually about to do! I looked at the uncooked hamburger meat, redder than the Japanese sun, and the fries that were swathed in salt as to distract the consumer from their burnt texture. Before I lost all appetite I looked to the grill hoping that the sight of a dark brown lump of flavor would once again put me in a state of anticipation. My hopes were slashed once I saw the sea of grease and liquidated fat that surrounded each island of a burger. By the time I reached the top of the line, pizza became much more appetizing option. I left that McDonalds with more than just a grilled chicken sandwich( a decision contrived through an internal compromise) but a dismayed attitude towards the fast food industry.  	 In 1954 two brothers, Dick and Maurice, created the first fast food service in their now famous restaurant, McDonald’s. The idea was simple and effective based on economic intangible of supply and demand; produce delectable food quickly. However, now 50 years later McDonald’s is a global success yet the quality that had been an integral part of this institution has drastically diminished with the passing of time. It is apparent that their tradition of success has made them more bold. That because they have hit the ceiling of success in becoming an international icon the only way to generate a greater profit was to cut the costs in quality. Corporation leaders were banking on the idea that convenience and past rapport would draw consumers…they could not have been more correct. Though the health risks of eating McDonald’s food is so high that it has become almost humorous the general public still delve into it’s fatty depths. It seems that McDonald’s could start advertising a monkey-meat burger but as long as it is served with fries and a coke at a value price droves of salivating consumers will flock out of habit.  	 The fast food industry has become a twisted shadow of what it once was. Quality and true value have been stomped out by unrelenting ambition and greed. Jean Michel Chapereau gives his outlook on the fast food service saying: 	 We were taken to a fast food café where our order was fed into a computer. Our hamburger, made from the flesh of chemically impregnated cattle, had been broiled over countefeit charcoal, placed between slices of artificialy flavored cardboard and served to us by recycled juvenile delinquents . (Chaperau, Un Hiver Americain)  This, sadly, has become a universal experience for a majority of the world. Unless something is done to stop this subtle genocide the only ones who will benefit are McDonalds executives, heart surgeons, and the funeral homes.

      I did this as a short essay that I wrote for the English Comp/Rhethoric class that I took at Fordham University:    A great number of people are tired of the disappointing rock albums usually containing recycled images and worn out clichéd lyrics. This is because the music industry has held on to a process of making less than adequate rock albums with a predictable structure to it (start off with two or three quick guitar snapping, drum thumping songs that scream for attention; then slow it down with a few acoustic songs and finish with the worst track of the album). Due to this, contemporary rock music can be summed up in one word: bland. However, daring to breathe fresh air into the rock music scene comes Brand New; a band from the suburbia wasteland of Long Island, New York who with their sophomore album, Deja Entendu, are reanimating contemporary rock.  	 One aspect that can easily be identified with this album is the influential use of bass very early. In many instances, bass lines are used to support roaring guitar chords but Brand New uses the bass effectively. In some instances using it as the foundation to some songs such as in Sic Transit Gloria…Glory Fades where the bass becomes the centerpiece for the entire song. The most appealing part of Deja Entendu is their confessional tone and witty lyrics. Singer Jesse Lacey attempts to stray away from the typical distressed love song in Good to Know That If I Ever Need Attention…where he sings that “You constantly make it impossible to make conversation, keep us comatose but audible.” Lacey also maintains his cathartic lyrics throughout the album, especially in Guernica and fan favorite, The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows.  	 With Deja Entendu, Brand New has left rock fans optimistic to the future of rock music. If there is a drawback to this album it is that with only eleven tracks Brand New is leaving fans yearning for more. Hopefully, they will develop their next album to be as good, if not better than Deja Entendu. I would recommend if you are a rock music fan who has grown weary of the repetitive garbage thrown at you from record labels that you buy a copy of Brand New’s Deja Entendu immediately.

      The other day online my friend Brian asks for help naming cereal slogans. He was having this weird battle with his cousin, Dyana, to who could name the most cereal slogans. After researching every site and taking a thorough ass-whupping from Dyanna, Brian and I decided to have a little fun.....and make up cereal with sexually suggestive slogans. This, for the most part, is when we started:  Brian[1:16 PM]:   A FAT LOAD IN EVER SCOOP!   Dyana[1:16 PM]:   whatsthat for?  Brian [1:16 PM]:   Boo Berry   Dyana [1:17 PM]:   what?

Poor Dyanna. Pray for Brian's soul.

      You may happen to be wondering how I dubbed my blog "Present Nostalgia". It happened on Father's Day when my father started into another one of his 50(or was it 60?) stories that he often repeats over and over throughout the years. We were on the West Side Highway in pursuit of my grandfather's house in Staten Island when his incessant rambling came to a halt and then... a lull of silence. He did then something that I have not experienced since I was young...amaze me with a brilliant story from his days growing up in New York.   He began talking to me about how he and a group of friends had a cable access show called "Present Nostalgia" that aired in Manhattan. From what he told me, the idea was bounced around for awhile during a poker game the group was having. They believed they could do some sort of rag-tag sketch show just for fun and laughs. Other people were doing lame shit, so why couldn't they do something they would find entertaining? Getting a show would be free as long as they proposed the idea to the network. Believe it or not, it worked! Granted that cable access is totally free and everyone is open to start their own show, the mere thought of a group of friends screwing around on television, even if the audience was limited, is an extraordinary concept and probably the coolest thing I have ever heard.   My dad recalls that the name was created to mimick the oxymoronic principle in the name of legendary rock band, Led Zeppelin.( For those who need an explanation: a Zeppelin is a blimp much to the fashion of the tragic Hindenburg and the irony of a Led or Lead Zeppelin is that it would then be too heavy to float, it is a contradicting object in the imagination. As with Led Zeppelin, Nostalgia is a longing for the past. It is impossible for something to be present if it is in the past. If it sounds like Im talking down to you in this anecdote that means I am.)   Anyway, from what I prodded out of my dad, the show was compiled of various weird segments that seemed like a precursor to the Howard Stern Show. The most memorable skit was one guy dressed as a woman and was offered on the show as a date. My father described this guy as the most pathetic cross-dresser New York has ever seen(believe me, there are a lot of bad cross dressers in New York), yet people called. They must have either been really blind or really horny to call in. Sad, just sad.   As one of the MC's, my father did a segment where it was a magic trick. They would take a live caller and my father would pick out a card, put it up to the camera facing away from himself, and then put it away in the deck. My father would then guess the card shown to the audience. So far, this seems like a lame trick thats been done over and over again. But here's the twister, one of his friend's off camera was practically screaming out the card to him on air. The humor was that the stupid caller was completely baffled and astonished on air while everyone else even remotely paying attention could have figured it out how and from where my dad was getting the answer.   Like all good things, "Present Nostalgia" was cancelled. The production crew got pissed after a skit where someone got pied in the face and some cream got on the microphone. On request that they pay for the microphone the group, including my father, proceeded to curse out the production crew and leave. P and N was, sadly, finished after just two shows.   Hence, in tribute to my father for being young, crazy, bold, and adventurous I have named my blog after a brief period of time whereI know&nbsp;he was just like me.    ON FURTHER NOTE: I have a picture he gave me showing two figures: the other host of P and N dressed in a Present Nostalgia t-shirt with a Richard Nixon mask on giving the president's famous two-handed peace sign. My father is wearing a mask making him look like an 80 year-old geezer wearing blue jeans, white and black Pumas, and a tuxedo with black bow-tie. Is that fashion or what?

       I live in the Bronx but a part called Riverdale that is totally the opposite from most people's preconceptions of what the Bronx is and looks like. I think of it as the middle-ground between Manhattan and Yonkers,a sort of sub-culture of upper middle class baby boomers, the Golden Girlish-elderly( the only thing that outdoes the enumerous Oriental restaurants are the plethora of nursing homes in the area), Jews( a group of people i like but,sadly, find willingly molded in the stereotype society awards them, e.g. how strongly they take to and even pride themselves in their moneypinching and incessant whining and greed....note that i don't find all Jewish people to be this way but am merely annoyed with the concepts of stereotypes,when people make them to be true i find myself disgusted), and a bored and anxious youth yearning for adventure, purpose, anything else than what these quiet and isolated streets offer which is exactly that....quiet and isolation. Riverdale is a not-quite-suburbia that may be Mayberry to some(this is an allusion to The Andy Griffith Show)but to me it is a safe haven for adults that entraps the youth in its mediocrity preventing creativity, growth, and inspiration.   It is, however, better than where I first recall growing up in. It was a place down the hill in Kingsbridge that was okay, but a little too seedy. Let me explain, one night when my parents were out me and my sister trembled after the news reported a shooting near the block we lived on.   Another example was during Christmas night when I was very young. I played into the night with my new gifts and was running rampant throughout the tiny apartment and, in doing so, annoyed an already disgruntled downstairs neighbor to seek revenge for my calamity. He piled up various pieces of furniture in his house until it nearly reached the ceiling. In this tiny gap between the tower of miscellaneous furniture and the ceiling he placed gigantic speakers and blasted heavy-metal rock music throughout the night. My father would within an hour alert the police who broke into his home and find the massive structures that could have been mistaken for pop-art had they been quiet, or at least a few decibels lower. Not quite sure what happened to the guy though, maybe he decided to live with a family of ferrets or found his calling in life to become a used car salesman. Whatever the case is I am sure that depressed(maybe because the ferrets bit of all of his fingers or that he was maimed by a used car that spoke Arabic...damn those Terrorist cars) Even though I have many fond memories of this place, one can clearly see that we couldn't stay there for much longer.   One further note about Riverdale: I GOTTA GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!!!

      July 24, 2004  Dear Friends, Fans, Haters, Players, and True Money Makers,  Hey! This is Kal Penn (aka Kalpen Modi) and John Cho writing to encourage  you to go see our upcoming comedy from New Line Cinema, "Harold and Kumar  Go to White Castle," opening nationwide on July 30th. This film marks the  first time a major studio is releasing a project with two Asian American  males as the leads. We don't have stereotypical accents, we don't passively  tread through the story, we're not asexual or hypersexual, there are no  martial arts scenes, one-dimensional cab driver segments. We play a couple  of all-American guys who happen to be of Indian and Korean descent. Our  characters (Harold and Kumar) are post-collegiate buddies who get the  munchies and end up going on the adventure of their lives as they set out  to satisfy a spontaneous craving for White Castle burgers. Ebert and Roeper  just gave our movie "Two Thumbs Up"! We hope you will too. Read on.  The opening weekend for any film is extremely important.&nbsp;&nbsp;Studio executives  (the people who make big decisions about movies) track the numbers from  that first weekend's ticket sales and make all kinds of decisions based on  that data. They decide if they will add more screens to show a film, if  they will spend more money in promoting it, if they will start investing in  a sequel... but most importantly, they decide if elements of the film work  and whether they should do it again. In our case, that means they will be  asking, "Will a strong script and story succeed or fail with 2 Asian  American guys in non-stereotypical roles?". We personally think it will  succeed, but we need your help! This film is our chance to prove that  realistic, non-stereotypical depictions can make an audience have a blast,  and take in enough money to make this happen in the future.  By buying a ticket to "Harold and Kumar go to White Castle", you aren't  just gonna get to see a really funny movie with two dudes who look like  you. Nope. You're also going to be saying to media outlets, "I support  accurate representation of Asian Americans and would like to see more." You  have the power to change things simply by buying a ticket to a film that we  believe you'll have fun watching anyway!  Please go to the theaters next weekend and watch "Harold & Kumar Go to  White Castle". We look at this awesome opportunity like we do voting in an  election. Every movie ticket someone buys is a VOTE, and the cool part is,  you're allowed to vote as many times as you want. With your support of the  film, we will show decision-makers in Hollywood that supporting movies like  these is not only the right thing to do, but is also good business. We'll  also show YOU what it's like to ride a cheetah, hang glide off a cliff,  pick up a hitchhiking Neil Patrick Harris (Doogie Howser), tell off a bunch  of ignorant punks, get love interests, and sing Wilson Phillips at the top  of our lungs.  So just hold on for one more... week, and check out the website at  www.HaroldandKumar.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;This film opens the weekend of July 30th! Send  this email to all of your friends. Throw parties. Order food. Make a night  (or weekend) out of it and go see "Harold and Kumar go to White Castle"! This  is a landmark opportunity for the Asian American community, and we are  proud to be the faces involved. With your support and the success of this  film, we hope that it's only the beginning of many more Asian Americans on  screen...  Enjoy the movie,  Kal Penn and John Cho  "Kumar" and "Harold"  New Line Cinema's "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"
