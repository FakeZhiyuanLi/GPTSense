       Well, on Wednesday, we took a 45 minute drive out to Coeur d'Alene to go to the "beach".  We were SO excited to just go lay out and swim for a bit in the lake and all.....little did we know it'd end up a bummer!      When we got there, everything was going great.  Kaili loves being outside and all.  We found a spot that wasn't too crowded.  We pulled out our sheet to sit on and I layed Kaili down to take her clothes off and put on some baby block.  She FREAKED out!  I figured she might have been hot, so I just continued to take off her onesie.  She continued to cry after I had taken it off....and she LOVES not having on any clothes!  So, I picked her up and tried to calm her, didn't happen.  Jeremy and I both hurried and put that sun block on her and he took her out to the water.        I stayed back getting her bottle ready in case she might have been hungry.  All of a sudden I hear this loud scream coming from none other...my daughter.  I'm surprised the lifeguard didn't jump out there to rescue the girl!  Jeremy raced back up to the sand and said as soon as her toes touched the water, she freaked out again.  So......I tried giving her the bottle....she wouldn't take it.  In matter of fact, she screamed louder!  We finally just said "lets go!"        I took her up to the sidewalk into the shade and away from the water.  She was just fine and dandy!  Oh, and at this point, she was just wearing her diaper.  We didn't even get her swim suit on fast enough.  It really looked like we were ghetto!  So, poor Jeremy had to pack up everything in that hot hot sun and carry it all up the hill.  We had her stroller so it was pretty heavy with the bags and all too.  He was drenched from packing everything up and carrying it up.  I was drenched from holding her out in the sun and shaking and moving all around to keep her calm!        We were there for probably I'd say 15 minutes at the most!  I don't think it was even that long though!  She's already got mommy and daddy working on her schedule...have us wrapped around her little fingers...and it ain't even that big!!!  What a day, what an experience!        We are gonna train her to like the water though.  She actually loves the water....warm water I guess.  She would shower with us and loves it.  Maybe the lake water was too cold for her and she didn't like it.  So, once the weather gets going again, we're gonna fill her tub with somewhat cold water, take her out on a walk till we're hot, come back and stick her SLOWLY into the water.  We just can't have a kid that doesn't like lake like that.  You may call us crazy for taking her and I'm sure some of those older people that were looking at us the whole time probably thought we weren't good parents but if you find an instruction book on how to raise MY child...let me know!  I'd like to see it!  -_-      So, my cousin, Fil, and his family are in Vietnam visiting.  It's his first time there and it sounds like he is NOT having such a great time at all.  Don't blame him.  I guess it's actually worse than what is expected of it.  Some of his stories are pretty funny though.  Half of the stories I don't even really  wanna know.  I look forward to going there one day with my mom but now....I'm starting to think twice.  I would be so excited just for the food there but Fil says it's not as great as I may think.  They are not very clean there and you really have to watch what you're eating.      It's a really poor country and he says its really sad to see what goes on over there.  All the rich people live in Northern Vietnam....and all the poor live in Southern....and most of the Southern Vietnamese are the ones that were fighting for a free country.  I don't know much about Vietnam but I do know its run by the Viet Cong.  He says they really do control EVERYTHING.  Its really sad to think about it.  Here is an excerpt from his journal:      "maybe i am being too critical of vietnam? i dunno, but i really do think that there are way too many problems that the damn VC goverment has left unsolved.  i swear to god that vietnam just wants to grow so bad that they don't give a damn about their country, they just try to absorb and imitate everything.  i think that if the people here would sit down and use their brains, that they can figure out how to help their country grow, quick even.  for instance...factories for making dried foods...people don't need to be tossing shrimp in the middle of the road to let them dry, thats so...DIRTY, and yet people still buy it and eat it (i'll never look at dried shrimp the same again...).....we finally started traveling, but so far...all i see is slums...  and i've come to know why people here are so freaking poor.  because the goverment does nothing, and people do nothing.  people work only for themselves, its so stupid.  if your country has money, chances are you will definitely have more money.  working for yourself gets you NOTHING, but a couple of measely things to eat.  the area's i've seen are so trashed, they are disease festering centeres of death and decay.  if i could do something for this country, i totally would....but...as it is, people are stuck with how they live here..."      So, I can only imagine what it's like...until I see it for myself.  I really do think people here in America take things for granted.  I admitt, I'm guilty too.  I take a lot of things for granted here but it's things you hear about and even experience that really makes you stop and appreciate what you have.  I know looking back at my childhood experiences and how my family started out when we first got here to America, it gives me all the reason to be grateful for all that I have today!!!      Well, it's almost 9 AM, it's almost time for Kaili to take her morning nap and time for me to get some breakfast!

       So, my buddy Linh introduced me to this website. I'm not sure how long this will hold up, but since I'm not doing so well writing in my own journal and I'm on the computer everday, why not try this out? I'm sure I can print out what I post and just paste it in my journal. Of course, if I have anything bad to say about anything, I'll just write it personally in my journal! HA!       Jeremy is at church right now doing the whole boy scout thing since he's the Scout Master and all. My baby is asleep, kinda. She wakes up every 10 minutes it seems wanting her soother. She just needs to keep the thing in her mouth if she wants it! She'd be sleeping through the night now if she didn't wake me up the few times during the night wanting her soother. I get mad a lot but I only stay mad from the time I get out of bed to the time I reach in her crib. You just can't stay mad at a face like that!       She did start on rice cereal yesterday so I'm very proud of her. Formula is a major kick in the butt! She's doing really well though and she's slowly taking in the cereal. Today, she ate a lot more and it was thicker too! She loves it. She started eating a lot more too. I think she's back in that kick of wanting to eat a lot. They say its good for them but Jeremy and I say it's too fetchin expensive. Why is formula so expensive anyway? Oh, and I am not a fan of Similac. There is something about it....I still have a whole huge can of it left....which will last us a week... but Enfamil seems to be way better!!!    We plan on going to lake tomorrow, hopefully. A weird storm, out of nowhere, came through last night so today was a lot cooler and not as sunny. Coeur d'Alene (Idaho) is really nice. However, people here say the lake has what they call a "beach". No, it's not a beach! California is beach....even the West coast of Washington is the beach, but inland in Idaho? Beach? Try again! The "lake" there is nice though and yes, there is sand there and you can lay out if you want and go swimming in the designated area. (I hear a baby crying...it's not my baby but I think some new people just moved in behind us and they must have a baby. I should probably go meet them sometime!)      Our home is still yet to be built. Hayden Homes need to pay more attention to Spokane and get things rolling around here. For one, I'm not liking my husband complain about how much he hates customer service. I don't blame him. Homeowners think just because Hadyen Homes built their house that every little problem that arises in their homes is caused by Hadyen Homes when 90% of the time, it's because of their wear and tear. Then they complain about something else when Hadyen Homes offer to fix THEIR first problems for free. Enough of the customer service crud. My husband has to deal with it....and since his office is currently in our bedroom, I have to deal with hearing about it when he's talking on the phone! I just want to be in my own home already!      Alicia Frank gave me this pretty good recipe for Cinnamon Tostada Chips:      3 large flour tortillas   melted butter   cinnamon & sugar      -Lighlty brush melted butter over tortillas on both sides. Sprinkle with desired amounts of cinnamon &amp; sugar. Cut tortillas into 8 wedges. Place on baking sheet one layer at a time. Bake at 400* for 8-10 min. or until lightly browned & crisp. Cool on wire rack. Optional: melt milk chocolate chips &amp; drizzle over wedges. Cool completely before serving.      The first batch I made, I pretty much burnt it but the second batch was beautiful! It's sooo yummy too. You all should try it. I guess instead of butter, you can spray it with Pam Butter Spray. It's probably easier too.       I recieved an email from Monica, I was thinking about her the other day and emailed her to see how she was holding up. Looks like Monica and Brandon's divorce is going to be final on Wednesday. Their first anniversary is actually on Sunday. How sad is that. He is such a ________. (Use your own imagination &amp; fill in the blank.) I hope she will be able to get over him SOON and move on with her life. Things happen for a reason and I've learned if you do whats right, things will turn out alright in the end. She's been released from Sunbeams cause she felt like she needed to be in Relief Society. That will really help her a lot I think. She sounds like she's doing pretty well though. She's a pretty tough girl.      Well, that concludes this entry. I'm sure there's lots more in my head that needs to come out but I should probably save it for another time...
