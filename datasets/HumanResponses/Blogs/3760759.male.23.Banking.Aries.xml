      I imagine that over the next few weeks the focus of Mr Blair's campaigning will be on the NHS, mainly due to the fact that the crown prince of darkness Michael Howard has set his stall out here during the last couple of Prime ministers questions.  Now lets get a few things straight from the outset.  Over the last seven years of government, Labour have reduced hospital waiting lists, TRUE, however they did this by putting patients on waiting lists to go on waiting lists, essentially, a patient wasn't referred until the local hospital could do the operation within a short (ish) timescale, It happened to my nan!!  Foundation hospitals will allow the hospitals to more astutely govern their own finances, thus making them more efficient and streamlined, TRUE, but the main worry at Addenbrookes hospital in  Cambridge, which is set to become a foundation, is that nurses and midwives may be about to lose all unsociable hours bonuses, the bit of the wages that pusshes their pay up to liveable levels, again it is happeneing to my partner Judith, a newly qualified midwife.  The Labour and Tory policy on the NHS is fundementally similar, however the tories are offering the option of subsidised private treatment immediately rather than in 6 months, for an elderly patient this could make all the difference.  Neither policy is perfect, but Tony Blair chooses to attack conservative policy as "abolishing the NHS" rather unfairly, seeing as he will do the same thing but apparently is strengthening the NHS.

      Democracy doesn't work!!!  A sweeping statement i know, but while we have career politicians knocking about, then democracy will remain like comunism, a nice idea on paper, but fundementally unworkable.  Democracy exists on the simple tennet that any man or woman can be elected by their peers to represent the views of their community in government.  The big problem begins when the electee arrives in parliament, with his or her high principles and big ideas, over time on the backbenches, this seems to get erroded and replaced with cynicism and a desire for personal advancement, candidates often convince themselves that this is because "the only place they can make a difference is in cabinet" and they will do anything to get there.   By the time an MP is promoted to cabinet he is no longer in touch with the comunity he represents ( apologies to female readers, for "he" substitute "he or she" ! ) and will no longer back his principles, he will do or say anything to stay in his position of power.  Don't believe me?? well take the example of tuition fees, it was teflon tone's toughest week in government and everyone was coming out against top up fees in the media, blair looked done for, his policy would fail to be passed as record numbers of his own labour mps opposed it BUT come the vote, the party whips whispered in the party ears, that, vote against the policy and you will be forever consigned to the political scrap heap of backbencherdom.  lo and behold the opposition crumbled and the policy went through, mp's justified their desisions by claiming it was subtly altered to a more favourable bill, they could continue to amend it......Yawn.  This happens time and again, but there is a solution.  when the election comes, don't vote for 'em.  Just because your MP is in cabinet doesn't mean he should be there, vote for someone else, and the power evaporates, and not just this, until the election comes, make life unbearable for em, right to your MP asking them to justify how they vote in the house of commons, convince your friends to and force them to pay attention to the community they are elected to represent.    Until we stop giving career politicians an easy ride we will live in a democracy run by a select and privelaged few who do not represent the views of their people, c dictatorship in your collins english dictionary.
