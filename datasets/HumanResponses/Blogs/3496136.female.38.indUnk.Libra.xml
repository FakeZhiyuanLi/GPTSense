      on my way to a meeting out of the hospital stopped at Wendys to pick up a salad.  Crash!...a guy in a big pickup truck crashed into me...well, my car.  He crashed into my newly washed and waxed Saturn.  This was shortly after being turned down [ever so gently] by Mark Groves for lunch today.  Honestly, I'm just really going to stop asking friends for shoulders...disappointed at every freaking turn.    I'm fine and the car has only a little red paint on it...but jeesch..  Could this day get any worse?  You know, if I were premenstrual or something I'd at least understand my seemingly uncontrollable emotions...but COME ON!  Is this some sort of test?    Maybe it's time I explored the joys of psychotherapy and better living through chemistry....

      Went to  urlLink this site  and took the quiz...they are called lemmings, I think.  I am an Anarchist...apparently  "You are a WEDL--Wacky Emotional Destructive Leader. This makes you an anarchist. You don't give a damn. When push comes to shove, you just forget about it--it's just not worth the heartache. What this means for others is that dealing with you can be aggravating, because they find they can't get you motivated about things they care about. What this means for you is that you are happier, calmer, and saner then they are on their best days.  You are near-immune to criticism, and those who know you well acknowledge and respect that. You may come across as lazy, but the truth is that you find little to get worked up about. Regardless, you have slews of friends, because they are fascinated by your world view, jealous of your lifestyle, and drawn to the fact that you are hilarious to be around.   You are a pillar in a sea of hot-bloodedness. You have a sweet tooth."  I'd be willing to bet that my answer would be different every time I took this quiz..I'm mercurial that way.  In a really foul mood today, mostly because I had to get up really early today...be at work by 7:30.  Taking pictures for the department website.  I'd post the link but I dislike being scoffed at.  I arrive on time ready to go and are the #@%#@ residents there?  Did I remind them yesterday?  Yes.  Did I send them email two days prior to remind them?  Yes.  Did I also notify the attendings so the residents could be excused from clinical services?  Yes.   Am I fuming?  Can you see the smoke coming out the top of my head?  Less is more...breathe in, breathe out...trudge onward.  And why am I truding?  WTF, why bother.  It's not like anyone listens to me or cares what I think.  Sigh...  I might be over-reacting.  Okay, I'm probably over-reacting.  Sigh...wish...nevermind...why bother wishing...been down that road and it leads nowhere but to heartache.  Attempting good mood...last night at rehearsal I got to sing with a full orchestra - cellos and everything.  After we finished the number the director says "Val, don't oversing."  I said, "I'm not oversinging.  It's not my fault the orchestra can't play any louder."  *wink*  The brass section cracked up...and so did everyone else.  Am having a good time in the show...but it's clearly community theatre.  I suppose it will be enough to feed my hunger for performing in the coming years.  Commedia opened "In a Minute Men" at the Just Off Broadway Theatre last night.  Hope it went well.  Hope Chris will call me today to let me know how it went.  I doubt I'll have time to reach him.  Residents....grrrrr...  Suppose I should turn my attention to the ingrateful little....darlings.  Less is more...breathe in, breathe out.  Sure could use a hug.

      I sent the following to the residents:   "It's Time for the Annual Great Locker Move.  Lockers are on reassigned based on year.  Please see Dr. K for locker assignment changes.  Once the dust has settled, I will assign the interns locker space.  Please have all your stuff moved by Thursday.   Val"  Dr. K then writes her very first email to the group:   "Please note.  Dr. B will not be able to vacate until after this week as she is interviewing.  This should not be an issue because there are many equally lovely lockers to be had.  If one has grand designs for Dr. B's locker you may purchase my favor with chocolate or sworn allegiance to George W. Bush.    Thank you, Dr. K  Cursed Texans.  So much for my dream year of teambuilding and a gentler kinder residency program.  I'm pretty sure I'm really in for it this year. I'm proud of her display of humor...at least the residents are learning something from me.  And it's probably not professionalism.  If you're not having fun WTF?  Right?  ;)

      Seymore is married to MotherPockets.  He has such a positive outlook yet realistic at the same time.  A blog I like a lot.  Here's his latest...  "Most of the gravest judgment lapses we all ever allow to muck up our lives come from one simple idea. We are going to miss something, and it is going to be great! It is something that would have made our lives complete and made everything make sense. Anxiety, infidelity, addiction, gluttony so many things find us reaching out from a good place and risking it all because there might be something more. Well, let me set your mind at ease. You are going to miss something. For that matter you will miss more than you ever experience. That is the infinite nature of the universe. Get over it. If you really experience what you have before you, you will have more to carry in you heart and head than many who rush from one thing to another, notching something as they go along. I can promise you, as one who has seen more of the world than most people will ever come close to seeing, who has had nearly all the ups and downs that this life can offer, you are going to miss something. I did. I can live with that. It is grasping for something that becomes important to so many, not the thing itself. How many people can you have sex with? How many eclairs can you eat? How many trips can you take? Once the individual experience has been had, did it add to your world picture? If not, that was more of a waste than doing nothing. Give yourself a break. Enjoy what you have. No, don't give up on doing new things, but don't do them because you are searching for that "perfect" experience. Make what you have perfect and you will have lived a life that will matter more than all the awards on your mantel and all the medals on your chest could ever give you. You don't need something from without to complete you. You just need your own permission. "  Hmmm...wonder what makes people feel incomplete?  Danielle today in the car said "When will the 'struction (construction) workers be all done with our road?"  Indeed, when will they?

      Today I had lunch at the Blue Koi with my new residents.  It's a noodle place.  Don't know how else to describe it...sort of Asian, not quite Chinese, not quite Thai.  Yummy, probably best describes it.   It's a hip, trendy smallish place in the 39th Street corridor.  All the waiters have piercings, dyed hair and tatoos.  The decor is comfortable and light.  Tile floor, booths along one wall, rag rolled walls, dark blue ontop of a pristine white.  Lots of Asian accents...ecclectic Asian accents.   The food was incredible.  Had boiled dumplings that came with a complex sauce that wasn't exactly soy and wasn't exactly sweet...I had a hard time not picking up the bowl and drinking it.  Lettuce wraps filled with a delicious chicken, basil, ginger concoction.  Minced marinated pork over bean noodles...called Ants on a Tree.  mmmmm....mmmmm...good.   The best was the tea.  They had easily 20 different kinds of teas.  Hot teas, bubble teas (tea with bubbles of flavored tapioca...I'm not adventuresome enough for this one yet), iced tea...mmmm.  I love hot tea - chinese hot tea.  This was a real treat...I tried a couple of different teas.  8 Treasure was my favorite, a sweet bright taste.  The taste is still on my tongue.  I feel refreshed and rejuvenated.    I would like to spend the afternoon in the comfy booth sipping tea and writing.  Looking out the window at the passersby...maybe go browsing at Prospero's Books?    And about the writing...I finished the Wild Minds book and the take home message in a nutshell was...  keep writing, doesn't really matter what. don't take yourself too seriously, you'll quash your creativity when you sit down to write, you have to clear the clutter.  She recommends writing at least 5 pages of stream of conscious thought before beginning tackling the current writing project.   I think those are all good ideas to try if you're stuck.  Writing is such an individal personal activity...I think you have to do what works for you.  Gotta start somewhere.  I like the idea of cleaning the clutter out of my mind first though.  I never start cooking unless the sink is clear of dishes, why would writing be any different?

      Marissa has moved into her new home.  Can't wait to see it and take pictures which I might share if people ask politely.   Christine and Dean are in a film and are filming today!  Christine is the 4th screaming villager - which suits her just fine.  She was born to be a screaming villager.  Dean is a sword swinging blademaster...an evil one.   less is more...  comfortably numb...

      I think  urlLink this  is a brilliant idea.  I've always wanted to get involved in a project like this.  I think recreating a trip down the Mississippi on a showboat [with gambling] would be just the coolest thing.  I've always loved history.   to that end...not the showboat thing but the history thing.  I have a new project at work that I'm really excited about.  In conjunction with the History of Medicine Library, I'm going to interview Dr. Krantz on videotape for an hour a week.  Dr. Krantz was chairman for 35 years of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.  He's 82 and crusty as a French bagette.  He curses up a blue streak and uses the most politically incorrect language that we have to keep him away from the litigenous medical students.  He adores me though.  For the last 10 years everytime he comes to KU [about once a week] he stops in my office to tell me a joke, each one more obscene than the last.  His penchant for filthy jokes aside, he has done a lot for women in the State of Kansas throughout the years, and he was a critical player in the desegregation of KU Medical Center in the late 60's.  I'm looking forward to learning more about the interview process and sharing his stories.     Wizard of Oz last night was most entertaining.  Had a bit of problem though...at intermission went to take some of the stuff [copious blankets, chairs and pillows - it's an outside ampitheatre]to the car and I couldn't find the freaking car.  I walked all over that @$%^! parking lot and I couldn't find it.  I finally gave up and went back in with all the stuff.  Enjoyed the rest of the show - the cast of Oz contained a chorus of 120 children...not a typo...120 children!  Dang, it's a huge stage...which will make a difference in my characterization [NOTE TO SELF:  Be Bigger].  Waited for the crowd to clear somewhat - figured that would make the car easier to find.  Well, we found it but when we got to the car the keyless entry thingy didn't work.  You know, the button you push that says *unlock*.  So I used the key, which set off the alarm...the car wouldn't start.  Sigh...so I had to wait 15 minutes to start the stupid car.  It was now midnight...dark parking lot with two small children.  Maybe I should have taken up karate instead of tap.   We did arrive home safely without further incident.   Raining today...going to bake cookies and play in the pop-up tent with the girls.  Reading Beverly Clearly to them "Mouse and the Motorcycle".  Also bought  urlLink Wild Minds  for me.  A friend who teaches playwriting recommended it to me.   I love  urlLink Boondocks .  Comic with an edge and a wry humor.    Listening to Madison read the comics outloud to her daddy.  Danielle is now *training* Mechante, which means the two of them are wandering around the house searching for trouble...better go clean up what they have left their wake.

      someone should do something about the balance problem with sprinklers.  You attach it, you carefully place it so it won't fall over, you turn on the water and voila...the sprinkler turns on it's side and you have to either get wet [don't get me wrong, I love being wet just not when I'm already dressed for work] or go turn water off and start over.  I have devised a rock system to hold the f-ing thing down...but you would think some clever human would have pattoned a cool invention to get a sprinkler not to fall over.  Sigh...listening to the sound of my girls giggling as they run through the sprinkler.   I am comfortably numb.  My relaxing weekend so far has involved 7 loads of laundry, weekly trip to the grocery store, mowed the lawn, and washed both cars.  Ah...relaxing.  I don't really know how.  Just trying to keep my brain on off switch so I'm keeping busy.  Wizard of Oz tonight with the girls at Theatre in the Park.    Feel...nevermind.  No stewing, no ranting allowed.  Less is still more.  Riiiiiight.

      Today is one of those days that I'll keep asking myself "SELF, why didn't you just stay in bed?"  Really wish I could get some sleep.  Somehow after nearly 40 years I still don't know where the off switch to my brain is.  I've been kicking around a couple of story ideas.  But I don't know where to start...do you just start writing and see what comes out on the page?  Isn't there supposed to be some sort of outline?  Character sheets?  Research?  I guess it doesn't really matter, as I'll be writing it just for me.  I suppose the approach to writing is just as individual as the individual writer.  Or any artist, really.  Hmmm....finding time to write though, is the trick.  Last night at rehearsal we ran act two.  I'm in act two a lot more, so the evening went by faster and we didn't start till 8.  Mark, who plays Eugene - my brother [have I mentioned yet that he's 6'5" and is built like a scarecrow?] slipped and said "In our fart of the world..." laughter rang through the dance studio where we rehearse.  My next line "Excuse me, may I say something?" which I changed, of course to "Excuse me, do you smell something?"  Last night the music director asked me to sing off stage on all numbers except solos, which was flattering.  I'll be body miked.  They are a fun group.  I haven't really taken learning the lines seriously...a very bad habit from hanging out with improv actors.  They gave me line notes last night...every time you call for line or transpose words, etc.  I said "You know I'm an improv actress and can't learn lines, right?"  wink.  Sigh, I'm going to have to buckle down though.  I called for line last night and couldn't hear her.  Gee, what a surprise.   I finally blew up the inflatable swimming pool.  We had some nice family time squirting each other with water.  Mechante got loose.  Two teenage boys were chasing her.  They were bent over breathing hard and one of them said to me "Man, she's fast."  Well duh!  She is a greyhound.  Fence, must build fence.  Plans for the weekend:  None.  I'm staying flexible.  I would like to take the girls to Theatre in the Park this weekend sometime to see Wizard of Oz.  But we shall see what happens.  Lawn needs mowed, flower garden needs to be weeded, and I seriously need to relax.  I'm not going to plan though...usually I make lists on Friday night of all I want to get done around the house and stuff I would like to do over the weekend.  But so not this weekend.  And I don't want to spend a lot of time thinking either.  Thinking too much lately.  Drunken stupor maybe.  Yeah...might be time for a drunken stupor.

      While working on a database, "My Val, you've certainly ensured the referential integrity with that update!"  Wow, I have integrity, at least referentially speaking...now that I'm updated.   "Hey Val, text page me your cell number.  Nevermind, I'll just IM you"  Doesn't anyone use a plain old telephone anymore?   Lunch discussion - ever wondered what gynecologists talk about at lunch?  Usually I would warn you to never, ever, ever ask...you'd be shocked and appalled...but today was just downright funny.  You see I was bragging on my baby brother, who is a career man in the Air Force.  He has just taken this exam to be a Master Sargeant.  He passed it on the first try which is quite a rarity I understand.  This led the discussion to commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers....and...[random people speaking following here]"How come they never promote people to be officers for just being damn fine soldiers?" "Like Audie Murphy."  "Audie Murphy?" [obviously a young pup resident] "Wasn't he a movie star?" [young pup who knows several of our faculty are veterans and have done their homework][Rant on...Sometimes the extent to which residents will go to brown nose amazes me.  The heirarchy of medical education is completely ludicrous.  They try nobly to advance young men and women based on objective criteria but the plum assignments just come down to who plays the game the best and that damnable old boy's network...and...well, I'd better stop now before I get into trouble.  Rant off.]  "Well, he made just one film, I think  To Hell and Back ."  "Wasn't there a sequel?"  "Yeah,  I'm Back From Hell "  Laughter.  " Just Go To Hell "  "You talking to me?  Yooooooou talking to ME?"    Ah...doctors can be such commedians sometimes.  At least they haven't totally lost their sense of humor.

      Some idiot went the wrong way on one of the bridges this morning and ended up killing him/herself as they crashed into 5 cars.  As a result, most of the traffic was merged onto one bridge which my normal 20 mnute commute was one hour and 15 minutes.  GRRRRRR!  With a 4 year old in the back seat...so that meant Barney music, cause I can't find my Shrek tape!  Now I can't get that voice out of my head....wouldn't it be awful if that was the last sound I ever heard?  Barney....*shudder*  My Horoscope today...I hate it when they are scary "You're putting up with a lot -- make sure you're at least comfortable. Start sorting out what you want to get rid of and what you want to keep. Less will be more."  Hmmm...less is more?  I thought it was whoever gets the most toys wins?   Friendship...now there's a vague term.  The eskimos have 50 words for snow.  We have just a few words really for those that are important in our lives..love, friendship and family.  But how do you define those relationships?  Is definition really necessary?  I have been thinking a lot about those definitions because in the face of looming crisis we tend to lean heavily upon those we love.  I just don't want to lean on the wrong person and accidentally crush something.   Last night at rehearsal was the costume parade.  My scene partner and I have rented costumes that won't arrive until July 5th.  We sat around literally until 9:50 last night (that's 3 hours and 20 minutes for those of you that are numerically inclined).  I did get involved in helping the teenaged dancers dress.  They couldn't figure out which way to wear the hats...I tied lots of bows and adjusted a lot of chaps.  Woo-hoo!  I love chaps!  Hard to sit around watching rehearsal and not direct.  I was in a vibe with the director though because just as I'd mentally think a directing note...he'd stop and say what I was thinking.  Watched the 7 minute dance number to "I Got Rhythm".  Wow, 65 people tapping on stage at once...wow.  Sure wish I was in it.  Waaaaah!  Okay, residency crap calls.

      Am looking forward to the Michael Moore movie.  I like it when art creates debate.  I never really believed in art for art's sake...art should have a higher cause than self promotion.    So I"m not sure if Farenheit/911 is classified as a documentary...but I intend to read what the right has to say about it like here in this  urlLink critical article .    I do admire Michael Moore's tenacity and for standing up for what he believes in.  I'm not sure I like his style of debate which inclused more name calling than fact but I can certainly understand getting caught up in the heat of momment.  Which was why I was never good at debate myself...I was good enough to win stuff in high school but not quite good enough to please myself.   So today is gloomy here in KC.  No more nights off from rehearsals so the grind begins.  I'm kind of excited though about performing on that huge stage.  Can't wait for opening night and feel the adrenaline, the rush and then fill the stage with energy, light and my voice.  I'm supposed to be miked - I've never been miked before.  Never needed one.    Marissa is closing on her house today.  I'm very excited for her.    Am going to speak to the owner of Prospero's Books down the street about commedia performing there.  They have poetry readings and music and other performance art on Friday and Saturday nights sometimes.  It would just be Marissa, Chris, Christine and me.  It's a small space.  I think it would be fun to do improv for a book crowd and we all have a different literary background so that would be quite entertaining.  *Crossing fingers*  Mark wrote a script for the JOB show "In A Minute Men".  Haven't read it yet but Chris, the newly shaven, is pumped about it.  I can't believe Chris shaved his beard!  He looks so different.  I saw him last night and his mouth is so expressive.  His goofy looks are much funnier now.  I teased him about getting him some *product* for his hair and that he needs to get it *shaped*.    He's going to play Ichabod Crane this fall at the Gem Theatre near 18th and Vine.  I'm happy he found some work.  He's talking about trying to lose another 20 pounds before then.   The Fly  Danielle, my 4 year old "Mama, there's a fly on the table."   SWAT.  Bottom lip trembling "Mama, that was a baby fly."  Heads bent over the smashed remains..."No, honey. It was pretty big. I'm sure it wasn't a baby."   Blue eyes wide, hand over her mouth "Oh, it was a mama one."  Yes, I ended up burying a fly carefully interrned in Kleenex. With a funeral and everything.   Well, off to recruit for the JOB show.  And to do a little work for gynecology ;)

      "Mommy, look out for the dragon!"   What?  Oh, right.  At the SCA event the people referred to cars as dragons.  Cars apparently have become dragons for good ;)    Sleep is over-rated.   Having lunch with Mark Groves today at the Thai Place in Westport which is just about the only reason I got out of bed today.  I am physically, emotionally and spiritually exhausted.   Trudging onward...

      Just back from Theatre in the Park - Sound of Music.  A nice production...I am hypercritical.  Was that a block of wood or Captain vonTrapp?  Did he really block the entire song of "My Favorite Things" on the bed?  Think environment and scale when you design props...puppets 18" can't be seen...bigger is better.  Well, wider is always better...but sometimes bigger is too. ;)  My kids really enjoyed it though.  They were singing along.  I had to tell Madison to just mouth the words...pretend to play giraffe while you're singing.   I hope our show is better.  i think the direction and staging is better, definitely.  I'm glad I'm working with the director I am working with.   A lot on my mind...can't sleep.  Gonna try the warm milk - read a book method.  Wish me luck.

      Used to sleep in until 11 before I had kids. Now I wouldn't give up the peace and quiet between 6 and 7 for much of anything. A nice cup of coffee, the paper and the dog at my feet....ah, Saturday morning on the deck. A chance to gather thoughts.   Grocery shopping, laundry and a lot of work done. Looking forward to taking the kids to the SCA Lillies War thing in a bit.    Ah...girlfriends  IM'd with a single girlfriend last night until the wee hours of the morning. She was asking me advice about what questions to ask this guy she's sweet on. Heavens, we behaved like giggly junior high school girls. So very much fun. She keeps me young. It seems whenever I'm getting in a rut and starting to feel sad she brightens things up. Ah...friends.   Children's Lit  The girls crawled into bed with us sometime last night during a thunderstorm. Woke up unable to move with one child in either side and a cat on my legs. What a great way to wake up. Danielle and Madison and I went to the library this morning and signed up for the summer book reading program. Each girl got 5 books. I checked out The Mouse and the Motorcycle by Beverly Clearly to read to them. Remember the Ramona the Pest books and Henry and Beezus! I was going to read The Lion, Witch and The Wardrobe but they didn't have it. I ordered it. Just looking through those titles made me remember how my mom took us to the library every Saturday morning. I so used to look forward to spending the morning at the library. Madison had already read one book by the time we got home. So definitely want to read Little House on the Prairie, BoxCar Children and the Secret Garden.   mmmm....Brisket  Am very happy cause Hen House was having a special on brisket $.99 a lb! Woo-hoo! Brisket for Father's Day. I love making brisket!    Dr. Phil  Flipping through the channels last night for a bit and heard Dr. Phil say..."Couples often fight about topics instead of issues.  Topics would be how much golf your husband  plays or how he doesn't do the housework *right*.  The issue would be how you don't feel safe or like a priority.  Couples need to speak about what each others needs are."  Hmmm...did he say golf?    Well, off to shower and enjoy the rest of the day.

      The Campaign  Last night I'm sitting on the sofa watching the  urlLink Newshour with Jim Leher  (who never seems to be there anymore...but hey, they have a great online thing now).  I  decided to try to start paying attention to current events.  And how about that 9/11 commission - What!  Goverment agencies don't communicate well in time of crisis!  No!  Said ala * urlLink Jack Benny   "Well".  The two girls came down the stairs. Madison very politely asked me if I wanted to see their "show". "We've been hearse-in' " pipes in Danielle. "Well, of course, let's see it." I said. "I'll go get Daddy". Greg was in the basement. "No, mommy its' just for you." Awwwwww.....I'm getting a little teary now.  Madison was first, of course, she made up a song about how fun it would be to sleep with a kitten. Danielle was next, she made up a song about how kittens are soft. Madison's turn - song about how only evil people won't help kittens. Evil people like Cruella Deville which started a whole new verse about how people should not kill kittens just for their fur...she actually went into Al Jolson pose...on one knee hands clasped to her breast, pleading. Danielle was next, she made up a song about how kittens are soft...sounded remarkably like the first time...but it had CHOREOGRAPHY! I'm so getting her tap shoes. I thought I would die laughing...it was very...lets say original. ;)   I gave them huge hugs and told them I would think about getting a kitten. The thought of them ganging up on me amuses me greatly and yet frightens me...the foreshadowing of things to come. LOL.   The playset and ramblings about tatoos  Last night got the playset delivered and set up in the back. Greg's mom bought it for us. The girls love it and will spend many happy hours sliding and climbing and playing in it. Greg's brother, Jeff, hauled it from Topeka and helped set it up. He's really tall and bald. He shaves his head. I wonder why men do that? He showed us his new tatoo it looked really cool. And then he started explaining it. It looked like a cut right below his right breast about 2 inches long then moving down his stomach were 12 drops of blood, one was black and it ended with a Chinese symbol. The drops were the apostles - black was for Judas and the symbol was Destiny. Which is pretty original and so not what I would get. I have thought about it and I can't think of a thing I would want tatooed on me...guess I don't have a permanent enough personality to have anything that would always remain or maybe nothing ever clicked for me. I know I would want it where no one could see it. So something small on the hip...maybe tiny letters "It's all about me?"   Yard work...yawn...  I spent a long time last night trimming bushes and then picking up the mess. I don't know what those things are called but they have thorns! Ouch! My hands are kind of torn up. The lawnmower is almost funtional again so I'll have to mow this weekend. And I have plans for the front flowerbed! I'm going to put in another flowerbed in the front late summer/early fall. And strawberries...must plant strawberries. The less grass the better. Thinking of putting in all rocks like they have in the Southwest. ;) Since I'll be digging...Woo-hoo...maybe the girls and I will make mud pies too!  Greg is going out of town to play golf but I meight get him to go to the  urlLink SCA Lillies War  tomorrow (weather permitting). The girls and I are going to see Sound of Music at  urlLink Theatre in the Park , probably tonight (weather permitting). I know I'll be thinking of the Lord of the Rings scene we did at Sedalia last weekend the whole time and laughing to myself "How Do You Solve A Problem Like the Nazgul?" And Sunday I'm going to blow up the inflatable pool and work in the yard. I'd like to find some time to write but we'll see how it goes.   Still haven't heard from the Lyric Opera people yet.  Am having lunch today with one of the resident alumni and the senior class. It's tradition. We go to McCormick and Schmick on the Plaza for lunch. I give them pictures - I take lots of pictures during their residency training - mostly for the website but some just for fun- and give them printout but this year I'm burning CDs for them. I think they'll treasure them.   And, dang I look good today. All dressed up in my administrator clothes, heels and makeup. I'm such an adult...who knew?

       Green day  While driving to work I ate a toaster scramble. Not just any toaster scramble - a Shrek II toaster scramble, the very kind two children desired with all their hearts and promised to be very good the rest of the entire day if I would just buy the Shrek II toaster scrambles. There was nothing else in the house to eat for breakfast, so I popped one in the toaster and ate it on the way. It was more than delicious I must say...a sweet berry flavor and fun green icing.   Turns out the green icing turned my teeth green...just like Shrek. Nothing like attending a meeting on how to prevent STDs in the KC area with green teeth. *bangs head on desk*    Madison and Mark Twain  Madison (my 7 year old) is campaigning to adopt a kitten. "...but mommy, think of how sad it would be if you were kitty without a home, alone in the world. I'd take extra special good care of it. And the best part is kittens are free!" Yup, I'm gonna start saving for law school.   We just finished reading Tom Sawyer last night. We took turns reading to each other outloud. She would read a page then I got to read two pages. I took the girls to the Mark Twain Cave last summer when we were home (I'm originally from Hannibal). How heart-warming it was for me to share something I love with Madison and have her respond so well. When we got to the part of the book where the cave is involved and they mentioned Aladin's Palace Madison said "Mommy! I remember that place! I've been there!" And she was riveted. She also likes the name Huckleberry. After we finished she asked if we could read it again. Awww...I think we'll read Davenport and Cherry Pie next or the Boxcar Children. If you're reading this, feel free to post some of your favorite childhood books.   We played war (the card game) and she cheated. Yup, law school, definitely.    S'plosions  Danielle (my 4 year old)on the other hand, watched Star Trek Enterprise with me last night. She loves *space* shows. :) This morning after watching some of the news (we try to catch the traffic before heading south) she says..."Be careful Mommy, there was a s'plosion (explosion)and you don't wanna drive through it." Blue eyes wide with trepidation. "That's on the other side of the world, honey." "Well, you should still be careful. You never know when a s'plosion is gonna happen." And she is absolutely right, you know...you never do.  ;)

       urlLink Here's  why.  I love his  urlLink show .  He talks about not only how to prepare food, but the history, culture and CHEMISTRY of food.  And he's just as witty as my friends in commedia, which is the highest complement I can give.  Am rumminating on an email to commedia...about moving on, about remembering where we came from and how to heal the rift between us all.  After more long talking with Chris, am unsure of what the future holds.  No group is constant.

      completely and totally bored...  I managed to catch up 2 days worth of work in oh...3 hours.  Sometimes, this job just isn't challenging enough or is it that I am just not as interested?  Are there a million small things piled up on my desk?  Yes.  Do I want to do any of them?  No. What do I want to do?  Hmm...don't feel good enough to do anything too active...I want to chat with friends or see a movie or sit on the deck and carve pumpkins.  Gosh I can't wait for pumpkin carving time.  I really should take up whittling.  A good use for all my excess energy.  Yup, that's me good ol' whittlin Val.  Course, no one will let me handle sharp objects....  ASSFBB yes, but Val no.  So unfair....so very, very, very unfair.  Really must get to work on my monologue.  oh, Oh, OH!  I wrote one!  I'm afraid to show it to anyone though.  Maybe I'll work on it a little bit more and polish it and then...  Auditions are in 2 weeks.  Being one of Red's girls is a little more work than I'd planned on.  Must buy new shoes, make bloomers and a skirt and...a wig?  A wig....or make a garland...must send Lawfully Good Man the audition information.  We're coming apart at the seams...but I think we can hold it together until KCRF ends.  Its just everyone is so weary of each other.  I think back to a year ago...that lovely night when we played at Hyde Park.  Rissy and I rolling down the hill.  The business meeting at Christines...such hope and dreams for the future.  We were so cohesed.  The driveway....the beginning of the end.  Still, it was such a lovely night.  Seems like a lifetime ago.  And it was.

      If I ever had a way to support this  urlLink bakery , I would.   I think I love  urlLink Barack Obama  .&nbsp; He's David from Five Smooth Stones come to life.&nbsp; Gee, how long before he gets assassinated?  Watched Amish in the City... Because it looked really intriguing...and it was. Young Amish people at a crossroads in their lives, tasting the outside world for the first time trying to decide whether or not to embrace their culture and faith or to explore the outside world. I have always been very curious about the Amish way of life. It seems so simple and pure. To watch these young people look at common ordinary objects like...parking meters with amazement was very entertaining. The city kids come across poorly...spoiled brat, know it alls. It is interesting to see how deeply the faith of the Amish kids runs...how moral they truly are. Watching them interact with the city kids is really interesting.&nbsp; But the most compelling moments will be when the Amish kids grapple with their faith and morality issues.&nbsp; Inner-struggles are always compelling.&nbsp; They didn't really need the city kids...they could have build a background for us of what it's like to grow up Amish.   Prospero's Books Performing live comedy in an artsy environ...should be great, great, great fun.

      Woke up to something shining in my eyes...it was the reflection from the shiny clean faucets!&nbsp; Woo-hoo!&nbsp; A bit sore from all the reorganization I did yesterday but how nice to move about in a clean almost clutter free house...until I walked into the girls rooms...le sigh!   But I have a plan...MUWAHAHAHAHAHAHA.&nbsp; Think the girls would be injured if they fell out of an elevated bed?&nbsp; I can always add a rail.&nbsp; Hmmm...  Have *Love Stinks* running through my head - ASSFBB sang it on Saturday.&nbsp; She ended the song with "Love Stinks...and STUFF!"&nbsp; Am still laughing at her antics.&nbsp; Ah...ASSFBBB!&nbsp; Hearts and flowers.   Starting the Chronicles of Narnia tonight!&nbsp; It's been so long since I've read it it'll be like the first time.&nbsp;   My new corner in my little room is wonderous.&nbsp; The perfect spot for writing and reading and enjoying a quiet moment.&nbsp; Gonna have to build up though...writer's cramp.&nbsp; Yuck!  Well, off to a productive day.&nbsp; The sun is streaming in through my windows, I look around my office at pictures of family and friends, listening to Seal "Love Divine" and in this moment...my heart is soaring...I am happy.&nbsp;

Tried a variety of alcohol last night...just sips for tasting purposes...orange vodka - rather like biting into an orange rind...YUCK!&nbsp; Raspberry Rum with Apple Cider chaser - a little taste of Raspberry followed by the chaser and then pop!&nbsp; Serious raspberry explosion in my mouth - kind of like pop rocks.&nbsp; Yum!&nbsp; And then homemade mead.&nbsp; Wonderous....after a sip wait 8&nbsp; seconds and the taste of honey coats your throat.&nbsp; Just loved it!&nbsp;   Met lots of new people last night and had a real ball.   Today is all about the cleaning.&nbsp; Breaktime is over...on the upside...now I have a little corner in my room that's all for me.&nbsp; I've decided to try writing the old fashioned way - on paper.&nbsp; Will be quieter there.&nbsp; I've put up some of my favorite pics and knicknacks.&nbsp; Gods, I'm glad to be rid of all that baby shit!&nbsp; Boxes and boxes and car seats and diaper genie and ah....clutter free.&nbsp; Lovely.

      Yesterday was one of those days where nothing went right...ever have one of those days?&nbsp; Then I went to lunch with the wife of *the guy with the cart* [chicks dig the cart ;)].&nbsp; They are building a house and we were talking about how disappointed he was with the size of the foyer of the model home they are considering.&nbsp; I said, he's overcompensating.&nbsp; Which made her snort diet coke out of her nose.&nbsp; *The guy with the cart* is not a large man, but he's awfully cute and considerate and...grounded.&nbsp; Yes, grounded and calm.&nbsp; A good influence for me.&nbsp; Anyway, she brought a couple of friends from the office who I think I might have terrified with my bad humerous behavior, but they were laughing too.&nbsp; Then she started talking about commedia and who has energy and what order of them she should introduce to her co-workers.&nbsp; I suggested she start with *the guy withthe cart* as he has less energy than her, move on to Shrew-baby, then Lawfully-Good Man, then me and then....   then she suggested Griffin.&nbsp; GRIFFIN!&nbsp; Griffin has more energy than me?&nbsp; *sniff*&nbsp; Maybe all that diet coke snorting affected her brain.&nbsp;   Then ASSFBB, of course.&nbsp; I would think the two of us would be tied.&nbsp;   Anyway, it was fun and I like her very much.&nbsp; I enjoy hanging out will all the martyrs.&nbsp; And it sort of turned my day around.&nbsp; Chatted with Shrew-baby and got a nice email from a friend.&nbsp; Right before the faculty meeting from hell...sigh.&nbsp; Doctors can be such children.&nbsp;   Audition information was wrong, it's not until the 14th.&nbsp; So I have time to work on the monologue.   Whip Girl and her hubby and 6 year old came over and took all the baby stuff.&nbsp; Going through the baby stuff brought back a&nbsp;lot of great memories, which I won't put down here but I will journal them.&nbsp;&nbsp;My girls...love, love, love them.&nbsp; So the stuff was cleared and I have a sitting room again!&nbsp; and a couple of empty drawers!&nbsp; Sigh...now I just have to move some furniture around.&nbsp; But it will be comfy.   Megan sent me her birthday pics from the party...heavens that was a fun party.&nbsp; It was a come as your favorite fantasy character.&nbsp; I went dressed as a catholic school girl.&nbsp; Madam went as Betty Page - and she looked just like her in all that black lingerie.&nbsp; And Shrew-baby was in red satin and black lace.&nbsp;I don't quite fit in though....I don't make mead, I'm not a pagan, I don't play video games, and I don't have quite enough outer angst.&nbsp; But I fit in enough to have a marvelous time.   Tonight should be fabulous.&nbsp; Meeting ASSFBB, Megan [must come up with a name for her here...] Shrew-baby and her victim, for karaoke.&nbsp; Then over to Whip Girl's for a party.&nbsp;   Haven't felt well all day.&nbsp; Don't know exactly what it is...sort of sick to my stomach and blue.&nbsp; Going to go take a nap.

       Writing  The process is harder than I thought.&nbsp; The time I have to write are not times of the day when I am at my most creative...in fact the times I have are when I am tired and worn.&nbsp; I hate rising early but that may be the only way.&nbsp; Sacrifices, the sacrifices we make to create and play.&nbsp; Boggles the mind, really.    A Couple of Thoughts on Religion  I was conversing&nbsp;with  urlLink Butterfly Bill  [now there's and interesting person]&nbsp;and he answered my question about what he gets from going to church with&nbsp;"I want to be part of some kind of spiritual community. It helps to keep me from going over the edge and becoming a total hermit and wingnut."&nbsp; I don't really believe in God as the archetypical kind old white man with a beard sitting on a throne.&nbsp; I don't like certain aspects of organized religion and I don't like being told what to believe.&nbsp; I do miss the sense of community though.&nbsp; I do miss singing in a church choir.&nbsp; I just don't think I could sit through sermons, too much like listening to the President's State of the Union Address.&nbsp; I want to be inspired by a sense of a higher being.&nbsp; I already know I'm not perfect and in the eyes of the culture I grew up in I'm going to hell [Do Not Pass Go, Do Not Collect $200.00 - and probably no Get Out of Jail Card For You, Young Lady] unless I repent and change my ways.&nbsp; But still there are many aspects of life I would like to celebrate.&nbsp; Mostly nature and random acts of kindness.&nbsp; I wonder if I'm missing a spiritual connection in my life though.&nbsp; I really wonder...

      Why when you can earn so much more of the almighty dollar?&nbsp; Why continue to fill out the endless flow of paperwork about residents and medical students that no one reads?&nbsp; Why go on having your salary cut repeatedly due to budgetary restraints?  Academic medicine is losing some of it's finest teachers.&nbsp; Healthcare is in a tailspin.&nbsp; If you get sick - be sure your doc has gray hair.  One of our finest teachers resigned today unexpectedly.&nbsp; He taught residents to operate here for 20 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also taught them to treat the patients and families with respect.&nbsp; He's a cancer fighter - and he manages to let his patients die with their dignity intact.&nbsp; How he's managed not to burn out in that field, in this place is beyond me.&nbsp; Maybe it's the respect for others&nbsp;his father instilled in him with his strict Southern Louisiana upbringing, maybe it was the discipline learned during a lifetime in the military service, or maybe it was the rapport he shared with students, patients and colleagues.&nbsp; Whatever it was...is now a shadow.  I&nbsp;hope that he will continue to teach residents.&nbsp; He has a gift for making the complex appear simple.  He's a very tall man 6'3" at least.&nbsp; Quiet and softspoken with a dry acerbic wit and he has playful side.&nbsp; He was on his way to the gym and his secretary and I teased him about his legs.&nbsp; He came back after working out and put on scrubs.&nbsp; We teased him again and he dropped his scrubs.&nbsp; I just happened to have a camera in my hands and have a picture of him with his scrubs around his knees with his shorts on - still looking as if someone had just finished ironing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I talked to Newt Gingrich one day while answering his phone.&nbsp; And have teased him mercilessly ever since.   He's one of the good guys.&nbsp; When you work with a person for 14 years, day in and day out...its hard when they leave.

       Friday -had a productive day at work, Chris J bailed on lunch, which was just as well because I had lunch instead with 3 of my residents and Dr. Wiley at Fric N Frac - home of a great Philly cheesesteak sand, and great steaks on Tuesdays and Thursdays. They have tables outside which is great when the weather is superb.  &nbsp;  Friday night at the show  Mark (who plays my brother) and I handed out the pins we had made. They were small pins that said "Chin Up", which is something we say rather chipper repeatedly throughout the show. I handed them out first to the stage crew when I got there early. Went out front to save seats and the next thing I know the other actors are asking me for the button cause all the cool kids have them. :) So everyone in the cast asked for the button and wore it with pride all weekend. It was a great idea and I liked it that everyone enjoyed it so much. Did I mention yet that I lost my wallet at the front gate? Luckily, the ushers found it and returned it to me. Good thing I have people looking out for me.  &nbsp; Greg came with the girls, my father-in-law came in from Albuquerque, my mother-in-law came in from Topeka with friends, and most of Commedia. The light board got rained on so they lost all the light cues which were programmed into the computer. Why should this affect the lighting, I don't know. All the equipment still worked - what they can't turn on a switch at the right time? You would think people could still run lights manually? WTF? The show went pretty well. I screwed up the tap number and was late for my last entrance. Just was unfocused. After the show came out to see everyone. Danielle and Madison ran up and gave me big hugs. Found out Danielle was dancing on the sidewalk and Madison was singing during "I Got Rhythm". Awww. My friends in commedia brought me flowers...awww. Hugs and accolades. :)  &nbsp; Greg and I went to the cast party. It was near 92nd and Holmes in a fabulous arts and crafts house. They had obviously treat the home with love and care. We sat around talking and laughing until 2 AM! We planned to steal a construction cone and turn it into a megaphone as a director's gift for Brian. Luckily, no theft occurred as Taylor's dad had one in his garage. Almost fell asleep on the way home.  &nbsp; Have become inspired to do a fundraiser for the Alcott Center. Want to do "I Do, I Do" in April at Alcott. Mark (played my brother)is willing (excited and enthusiastic even) to play my husband. He has a such a beautiful tenor voice and the right attitude for the character. We had nice onstage chemistry and had so much fun working together. I thought the show would be perfect because it's a two person cast, takes place in one place and can be done with only a piano. I think it would work well in the Alcott stage space. Will present a proposal to the Alcott board and check on royalities. Have a couple of piano players in mind. I've always wanted to the show. I could direct it. Have a couple of choreographers in mind...not that much is needed. I hope it works out.  &nbsp;  Saturday  - slept till 10 went to the Alcott Center for the pirate improv workshop. We had 16 participants. Started with evaluations and then played games until 2. I love observing, digesting and then trying to vocalize what I see in a constructive manner. I find it to be so helpful when I get constructive criticism. The hardest part was not jumping in to play. It's been gosh, almost a month since I did any improv. Went to lunch at Arthur Bryants with the crew. Had the pleasure of sitting with Don and Chris . I respect the work they are doing with Red Griffin and enjoy watching them perform at fair. Am so glad I am getting the chance to get to know them better. Lovely people. A new color to the palate of friends. Went home and painted the cone. The paint I used said it would dry in 72 hours. Uh-oh. Stopped at Target to get markers and found just the best card for Mark, who plays my brother. Stopped at Alcott on my way to the theatre. Saw Adrian and Leslie and Faye and Chris and some other renfest friends. Went upstairs and played for a bit.  &nbsp;  Saturday's show  was wonderful. No lighting issues, no sound issues. Managed to make all my entrances and did the tap steps right. Yaaay! The party was in Olathe near Black Bob and 146th. One of the cast brought his karaoke equipment so we had karaoke on the first floor and musical theatre jamming in the basement - with a partial orchestra ;) Scott the violin player can play be ear. He and Greg and I had a great time talking. I invited he and Jenny who plays piano excellently to my house sometime to jam - a folk jam! So I sang "Love Shack" with David who did the best imitation ever of the B52s...I really forgot that I always dance to this song and have never really listened to the verses...oh well, we certainly had fun. I made up for it later with "I will Survive". Brian, the director started dancing like a crazy man and the next thing I knew I had back up girls dancing behind me on the fireplace hearth. I so rocked the kazbah! Then I went downstairs and sang "Tell Me On A Sunday" from Song and Dance, cause it was demanded. ;) "Take the hurt out of all the pain...take me to a park that's covered with trees...tell me on a Sunday please" We were out until 4AM. Greg played foosball and pool and laughed and made friends. I think he might have a better time at these cast parties than me ;) Okay, probably not. It's a tie :)  &nbsp;  Sunday  Got up at 10:00 and went to teach improv. They started at 10. Damn. Had fun anyway :) I learned a lot about pirate vocab and ships and pirates in general. Did evaluations. The group as a whole did so much better the second time around. I think every person there got something out of it. We stayed late to play shopkeeper. I took my group (woo-hoo! I got my own group!) with Rissy (woo-hoo! I got to play with Rissy!) into another room. Secretly pleased that Don and Chris and Jeremy [hearts and flowers! Heavens, I'm shameless for Seamus ;)] came with me. They played shopkeeper a couple of times and then I taught them slide show (badly) and explained elevator, though we didn't really play it. I really enjoy running the games. But man, it made me hungry to play. I had planned not to go to any rehearsals until after fair, but I doubt I make it. I miss playing with Rissy and everyone. So went to lunch with everyone at Fric N Frac. I was in the middle of man sandwich - between Jeremy and Don. Woo-hoo! Great conversation! Learned a lot about everyone. Chris' mom - I think I love her. She's bold and witty and kind. Just a joy. Jeremy bought lunch, what a sweetie. After lunch I showed Jeremy the way to the QTrip and then to I-35 south. I headed North to home.  &nbsp; Got my things together, hung out with the girls for a bit and then headed to the show. The last show was great. We all got a bit teary at circle. Before every show Brian gathers his cast together and we take care of any business or general announcements and then he says something inspirational. I really like this tradition. He's a really sweet man. I gave Mark a card that had a peacock on it. Inside it said, "I couldn't be prouder of you". I wrote in "This is the only card I could find with a c$#% on it." LOL...he died laughing. We really bonded by being just frankly so nasty...we made fun of the song "Slap that Bass" as "Slap that Ass"....my, oh my, we had fun. I took lots of backstage pics before the show and during intermission. During the last scene Mark and I are sitting having *martinis*.&nbsp; I had this business where I spill a little on my chin - imagine that but that night I spilled the whole thing down the front of me.&nbsp; Jenny was so cracked up she had to leave the stage early.&nbsp; I was using my cardigan to wipe off my face.&nbsp; And then we struck... &nbsp; and we struck... &nbsp; and we struck until 2:30 in the morning. I got to work with Kaitlyn and Tara in the shop pulling staples and screws out of wood. Then we got to stack huge pieces of Luon - I carried them over my head "Val Smash"...Managed to have a good time. Hung out with Loren and Curt a little. I adore the cowboys who are light in the boots. I didn't stay for the pizza. I sort of sneaked out cause I didn't want to say a bunch of goodbyes. I'll see the people I connected with again. I am so grateful for this experience. And I was afraid I'd fall asleep.  &nbsp; Which I almost did anyway...It's a long drive to almost Gladstone.  &nbsp;  Monday  I slept until 10. Greg was off and so was I. We kept the girls home and had a great day all together. We watched Greg play golf - 9 holes and then went home while he played 9 more. He loves it so. I love being outside and walking and thinking. Reflected on the weekend and what it is I want. I achieved my goal of being in a musical so what's next? I enjoy teaching and playing improv, I enjoy spending time with my children. I suppose the next big challenge I face is my hearing. That will be solved in the next couple of weeks, hopefully. We went swimming. We ate a snack. I took a small nap. Then our friend Bill and his girls (15 and 11) came over and we all went to the Royals game. We tailgated and watched the game. The girls really enjoyed it. Got home around 11 and went immediately to bed. It was a fabulous day.  &nbsp;  Today  I slept till 10.&nbsp; I'll start normalcy tomorrow. Today, I'm going to do some domestic stuff and spend time with the girls. And tonight I'm going to write. I don't think one day creates balance. But it's a nice start.

      Greg:&nbsp; Hey girls, look at those cows on the other side of the fence... &nbsp; Girls:&nbsp; Moooo, Mooo, Mooo, Mooo...(didn't seem like this chorus of moos was ever going to stop so...) &nbsp; Greg:&nbsp; Girls, don't do that please.&nbsp; It's scary. &nbsp; Madison:&nbsp; Who's it going to scare Daddy?  &nbsp; Greg:&nbsp; The golfers.  &nbsp; [a beat] &nbsp; Madison:&nbsp; Are golfers stupid, Daddy?  &nbsp; tee-hee-hee.&nbsp;

      I played today. Haven't played in a long time.&nbsp; I am rusty...but Chris was particularly hard on me as an example in the Who, Who, Where, What game.&nbsp; Which is a difficult exercise really.&nbsp; Played with some of the Red Griffin crew...three in particular are quite talented.&nbsp; I disagreed with Dean on every point only to bring out more discussion of acting in general.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Dean, Erin and I served as evaluators and we had forms to complete on everyone.&nbsp; They coupled up and did two minute scens.&nbsp; The first thing Dean did was set out his the Dory the Bluefish and he said "We can't have proper feedback without Doug."&nbsp; Evil, maniacal grin on his hairy face.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Memories of last summer as I spent the day in Alcott, walking up and down the stairs, in the theatre space, the green room and Chris' office.&nbsp; But today, I am smiling at the memories....somehow they don't make me sad.&nbsp; They are comforting somehow. &nbsp; more later...gotta get ready for the show.

      was shoved under my door this morning when I opened my office door.&nbsp; Karen, favorite resident had asked me if I had ever read this children's&nbsp; urlLink book .&nbsp; She said she would find it an bring it in for me cause my girls would really like it.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I read it and it made me cry...tears of joy as comprehension dawned on me...love for another person is as individual as your children.&nbsp; It's indefinable and warms you to the tips of your toes.&nbsp; It's such a simple thing really.&nbsp; She'll never know how much this allegory has helped me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Her inscription BTW:&nbsp;  &nbsp; To Val,  Whom I love the orangest, reflecting her fierce energy and passion.&nbsp; May friendship burn forever.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Karen.  &nbsp; Wow...I am truly blessed.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Start from sleep from the tornado sirens. Turn on the TV and watch the weather...holy shit! Grab the children and the husband and the cat and the dog and go to the basement. Images of the tornado that wreaked havoc on our neighborhood last year coming fast in furious unbidden in my head. A sigh of relief as the storm heads north.  &nbsp;  All four of us sleeping uncomfortably in the king bed. Woke to two beautiful girls sleeping. I am very tired but waking to that image will sustain me through the day. I will admit I took delight in the evilness of waking up their little butts and getting them ready for school. heheheh  &nbsp;  Last night's show went very well. The cast party was at Kaitlyn's house. We were both supposed to wear our Tinkerbell shirts yesterday and I forgot. Oh man, she looked so disappointed. She forgave me though and we'll be Tinker-twins on Saturday!  &nbsp;  Talked to Brian (the director) about teaching an improv class at his dance studio and he seemed pleased. The schedule is going to be published on Monday though so&nbsp;Beardless Wonder Acting Coach&nbsp;and I will have to decide quickly who, where and when pretty quickly. I am pretty excited about the chance to work with young actors. May have to put it off until next year, but...we shall see.&nbsp; I'm actually more jazzed for this opportunity for Beardless Wonder Acting Coach&nbsp;than for me.&nbsp; He's such a good acting teacher.  &nbsp;  Tons to do...all of my family is coming to the show tonight. Man, it's going to be so very fun. :)

      Okay, here's the questions... &nbsp; The Questions: 1. What are the three most important non-living things in your life? These can be work, ideals, material objects, dreams, etc. 2. You are at my favorite bar, Charlie-O's. The place is smoky, with low ceilings, loud people and filthy surfaces. Beer is overpriced, the music is too loud, and the place is packed asshole to elbow with the freakiest conglomerationof Montpelierite Vermonters you've ever seen. What is your immediate visceral reaction? 3. What is your favorite season and why? 4. What do you wear to bed? 5. What question would you like me to ask? Be advised that I will do so.   My Answers  1.&nbsp; Three most important non-living things in my life are my house (have already poured a lot of time, energy, dollars and dreams into the good old ivory tower in the middle of suburbia.), my performance goals (notice I said goals instead of dreams - go me!) and a silver charm of an elf my aunt gave me when I was 10 (it's a connection to a very special and unique woman and a connection to my childhood). Hmmm two of the 3 are material....well, we are *living in a material world...and I am a material girl...*&nbsp; Oh looky, I just turned into Madonna!!! 2. Charlie-O's, huh?&nbsp; I don't know what&nbsp;"Montpelierite Vermonters" are?&nbsp; Are they eastern rednecks?&nbsp; Hmm...Order a beer and conspire to start a wet T-shirt contest. ;)&nbsp; No really, I'd order a beer and have as much fun a possible - hopefully involving dancing.&nbsp; Me, I've never really met a stranger, I love beer and the whole bar scene. 3.&nbsp; My favorite season is autumn - I love the sound of the crisp leaves under my feet, the smell of applebutter and football.&nbsp; But mostly, I love the autumn leaves and the remarkable colors.&nbsp;  4.&nbsp; Varies...sometimes nothing, sometimes a comfy big cotton T-Shirt, sometimes a white silky nightgown and sometimes flannel jamas.&nbsp; Usually, comfy big cotton T-Shirts - I always wear socks.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; I can't really stand for my feet to be cold. 5.&nbsp; Is the glass half full or half empty?&nbsp; Today the glass is half full...but I'm living on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp; Check back tomorrow for glass status.

      particularly spicy ones such as those served at the  urlLink Bulldog  will give you gas.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  Heavens they were good though.   Had lunch there today with Madame (the illustrious Red one) and Whip Girl (she of closeted Halloween fame).  Madame cut off her hair and dyed it brown.  Whip Girl is 7 months pregnant.  We talked about upcoming fest, how BlondeLittleJohn (the one I climbed during chessmatch) created fireworks and then blew them up on the 4th (no rennies, geeks or freaks were injured during same), upcoming baby stuff and of course, sex.  A frank discussion with those two made me feel...well, *blush*...that should be enough said, I am blushing!  Me!  The toys described...NOTE To Self:  Find a Priscillas on the way home.    Then we planned a baby shower and talked about a pagan festival and the joys of creating a commune.  We talked about our puppies, children and jobs.  They are lovely women inside and out.    I was thinking about different relationships are between men and women.  The conversation that a group of three women would have versus the conversation three men would have, I mean as an example.  Really, why are women so much more based in emotion?  It seems to drive us.  Or at least the women I know.  And women just bare it all to each other...completely.  Well, mostly.  Men, I guess I don't really know.  I guess that's an age old question though, one I'll never have the answer to...why are men and women so very different emotionally?

      Horoscope Today... You already know that you don't have to express every emotion that you feel.  [I don't?  wow.]   But this doesn't mean that you shouldn't feel them.  [I only recently figured out how to express them.  How is it that you feel a strong emotion without expressing it?  How do you not react to a punch in the stomach?]   If you bury emotions, you will end up being controlled by your fears instead of by love.  [what if I don't want to be controlled at all?]  Even in the workplace, you'll be pulled between the safety of rational thoughts and the vulnerability of feelings.  [rational thoughts?  in the workplace?  You haven't lived until you've worked with 7 other women who all take Premarin (it's hormone for menopause)]    Logic may create security, but it won't cure loneliness.  [So Vulcans are lonely?  Poor Spock]    Last night we had dinner at Applebees.  The girls enjoyed their mac n' cheese.  I had a fabulous steak with bleu cheese and great big beer (They come in pints?).  Greg's 92 year old grandmother had us worried but her results came back and she'll be fine.  Whew, sigh of relief.  She's headed off the Washington DC today.  I so admire her spunk.  We call her Grape.  Her husband died 18 months ago and she has been spending almost all her time traveling to see her family - Albuquerque, Washington DC, Salt Lake City, Switzerland (yes I said Switzerland) Alabama and Colorado.  It's like she's trying to get in all the travel she can.  Well, hell good for her.  She was sort of stuck taking care of her husband for the last 15 years so she SHOULD enjoy herself as much as she can.  The really amazing thing about her is that she takes no meds on a daily basis - at the age of 92...now how rare is that?  She taught first grade for 45 years, raised 3 boys who grew up to be fabulous men and PhDs all of them, all while her first husband was bedridden with Parkinsons.  She cooks like you wouldn't believe and she doesn't judge.  She will certainly tell you what she thinks if you ask her but she's open to more than one solution to a problem.  She is a shining example of how to live a happy life.  I have asked her often for advice and never managed to follow it.  All of her grandchildren would rather die than disappoint her.  And the funny thing is, the thing they don't know is...they couldn't disappoint her.  Because she loves them for who they are not what they accomplish.  To be so vibrant at 92...  Had lunch with Shrew-baby yesterday.  The show is coming together nicely, I can't wait to see it.  I listened.  Sometimes, that's all you really need is someone to listen to you, really listen.  Then she listened to me.  We're sort of stuck in the same place.  She has the most amazing amber eyes and a wit that is so sharp.  On the inside though, she's as soft as a goose down pillow.  I find her company so very, very, very comforting.  This better living through chemistry thing isn't working out so well...maybe I need better chemistry....almost didn't get out of bed this morning. Tossed and turned all night.  Sleep is overrated.  My mom isn't coming to the show.  I convinced her not to...no point in driving 8 hours for a two hour show on your one day off in 14, is there?  I'll send her a tape.  I think I am supposed to get the CD ROM with the pictures from the show today.   My brother has taken off with his on/off again girlfriend.  She's a bit of hippy.  Well, she's a hippy.  No doubt about it.  They are leaving for a 3 week *vacation*.  Heading to Mount Rushmore and other sites yet unseen.  She says she's going to dry him out and then see what happens.  Having my brother around, drinking was just killing my parents, literally killing them.  The stress...my dad's BP through the roof.  My mom...losing her hair.  And our family has great hair.  So Mom told him when/if he comes back and he drinks she's throwing him out.  Now she's beating herself up over saying that to him.  I am trying to reassure her she said the right thing and I hope that if they get to that situation that she'll follow up on her words.  It's a tough situation.  I am amused that the name  urlLink Griffin  is so intricately involved in such a courageous act of rebellion.  If my friend Griffin were actually there he probably would have dumped the tea just so people would drink more coffee ;)  So show tonight...hope it won't rain.  Here I go...trudging onward...

      There's a storm coming in from the north and it looked like an Ansel Adams photograph.  A black and white piece of gray masterpiece.  Phenomenal.   Madison is very blue still.  I think part of it is tiredness.  I feel compelled to make her feel better but you know what?  I won't be able to.  Each person, now matter how large or small has to own their own feelings.  Maybe she likes feeling blue.  Maybe she's trying to get attention.  I shall just let her feel what she wants to.  The only person I can control is myself and I am not going *impose*, *project* or *expect* anyone else to feel the way I want them to.   Heavens, I think I might be growing up!  *looks around and begins to chase own tail*  Maybe not!  ;)   I was thinking about Jeff Smith this morning, you know the Frugal Gourmet.  He died last week.  I was looking at my row of cookbooks and I have three of his cookbooks.  I watched his PBS cooking show religiously and tried many of his receipes.  He's the one who inspired me to become a good cook.  I wish I didn't feel ashamed for admiring him.  Because no matter what he may have done or may not have done with children (which is totally wrong, don't misunderstand me - that's just sick and so wrong), he taught me stuff and the good part of him will live on in my memory.  A love for good food, a feeling that you can show your love for others by doing nice stuff for them - cooking their favorite dish.  It's the little things...hey isn't that a Sondheim song?  Yup.  From Company.  Everything is a musical with me.  ;)  Gosh I got so off track, so one other thing I wanted to say about Jeff Smith is that during his three great cuisine (Italian, Chinese and I forget the other one, nust mot have been that great) I made the most fabulous dinner ever for a superbowl party.  We had Hot and Sour Soup, crab rangoons, fried rice with shrimp, chicken and pork, Stir fried Lamb and Vegetables in Lettuce rollups and Peking Duck.  Yes, I had a 10lb duck carcus hanging in my kitchen basting for 2 days.  It was just the best thing I've ever put in my mouth!  I'm getting tired just thinking about cooking all that stuff now but looking back, it was wonderful.  I didn't see any of the game and the clean up was hell.  But, I love cooking for friends.  I should do it more often.

      The conversation in the back of the car on the way home.   Madison "Danielle, I got some new toys.  They are in my suitcase but you can't play with them, cause they have a warning and they are very breakable and no one who is 4 or 5 or 3 or 6 can play with them.  They are action figures." Danielle "Well, sissy, that's okay cause I got your other action figures in my room while you were gone.  I'm protecting them.  But it's okay cause there's no warning on them." It's not often my oldest is speechless.  Repeated exclamations of how much she misses her Bomm and tears.  Finally Danielle says "Madison, will you quit crying about Bomm, you're killing me."   Ah...the joys of home.  Glad she is safe and sound and asleep upstairs.  Very sweet that she misses her Bomm.  Want to figure out a way to post pictures here.  NOTE TO SELF:  research hosting and crap like that.  Have decided to use code phrases for friends.  If you know me and can't figure it out...then you must be stupid ;)  but you *could* email me and I'll tell you.  Am IMing right now with Shrew-baby, Lawful Good Man and The Guy With The Cart.

       Hope floats  One of our former faculty has had a recurrence of breast cancer and it doesn't look good. She was cultured and soft spoken. Earlier in her life she was classically trained on the piano and even toured with one of the East Coast Symphonies. Her father was the first African American physician to practice in Kansas City. She spent a lot of her time doing charity work for the community. The best thing about her was the way she would bend rules to just the breaking point - she had an inate talent for knowing when to stop. Black eyes that sparkled and a smile that could light up a room. She told me once that I need to relax more. The next day she brought me a pair of slippers with stars on them - big furry powder puff blue ones with one large yellow star on each toe. They were to "get you started on the right foot. Relaxing will lead you to your stars, Val." That was gosh, 4 years ago? She never seemed to be truly focused on teaching or her clinical duties. It was like she was on another plain - and she was. I think she took the faculty position because she didn't want to move her family and she knew academics would have less long term responsibilities than private practice. I feel privileged to know her.   I wonder what it must be like to go through chemo? Is she lonely? Does she want company? I know that she is very sick and cannot cook and do things for herself right now. She has plenty of help, I offered. I sent her a note and I've called her a couple of times but I want to do more. I worry that she wants to be left alone or is too ill to be bothered. I am hoping that she will recover but the results from her surgery....hope floats though. Hope floats.    Madison is coming home today!  Madison is coming home today! Madison is coming home today! MADISON IS COMING HOME TODAY! She has been in Albuquerque with her grandparents for a week. They took her all over town and up to their cabin in Southern Colorado. She played in the river and went hiking in the mountains every day. I talked to her every night. Listening to her telling me what she did that day, imagining her facial expression, and laughing at her impressions and astounded at her insight and vocabulary. I can't wait to hug her. Last night she suggested that she stay there and we move down there. ;) I watched Danielle and Madison talking on the phone. Danielle pacing and in my imagination I could see Madison doing the same thing. Danielle is not allowed to play in her sister's room, by decree of her sister. Of course, this week...well, we'd better get it cleaned up before she gets home.   Kurt and Jason  Kurt plays Lank Hawkins in the show at Theatre in the Park. Kurt is an art designer. He has curly black hair and is tall at least 5'9". He has black eyes and really long eyelashes - I just hate it when men have better eyelashes than me, but don't they all? Kurt was a little overwhelmed by me at first in rehearsals. I am a strong flavor. Every time I turned around there he was on the edge listening and laughing. I finally just started hugging him. He opened up a little to me. He and his partner have been together for 15 years. He got to go to Disney and go in the vaults. His joy describing holding an original sketch from Steamboat Willie was contagious. Kurt reminds me a little of Dean Kinsey - quiet, intense and lawfully good. Kurt takes personal responsibility for ensuring that the scene changes go well. He's one of those people that really care about the quality of what they do...not the quantity...the quality. I met his partner on Saturday night. He's a delightful man who is quieter than Kurt. Nice laugh though and beautiful eyes. There was a palpable tenderness between them. Kurt's singing voice is magnificent and not used enough in the show. He's a very good actor and is very giving onstage. In short, I adore him.   Jason plays the male lead. Jason is the shyest person I have ever met. It took me eight weeks to figure out if he even liked me. Jason works at Worlds of Fun and does 5 shows a day...then he came to rehearsal. He's a senior at KU. His singing voice is like silk. He can dance and when he chooses his smile is dazzling. I told him at the cast party that I still wasn't sure if he liked me and he gave me a very big hug and said "who couldn't like you?" Awwww....then he stayed around to hear me sing. He complained that his makeup made him look like a Mexican. I said "Andale, Bendejo." He is a serious and somber soul, I think. Though he does like to kid around when he's finally comfortable with you. I think people perceive him to be stuck up because he is so shy and handsome. I would have never made the effort to get to know him were I younger so I'm glad I met him when I did. It was worth the effort. He's a sweet kid.

      at my desk whilst trying to get organized.  Never, ever, ever going to get caught up.  sigh...  the brie is good though.  And grapes and carrots.  didn't really eat lunch today - have been grazing.   Last night the show was cancelled after the first act because of rain.  This meant the cast party started early.  It was at the Guacamole Grill in Olathe.  We had karaoke.  The best part was they did one karaoke song, one dance, one karaoke, one dance.  I danced my ass off!  HA!  Danced with the teens - some of them had never seen the Madonna foot hop thingy.  Electric slide...mmmm...baby got back!  Wow, it was fun.  I sang Black Velvet and treated the mike stand like a pole - got a huge laugh and a standing ovation!  fun, Fun, FUN!  Still smiling thinking about last night.  Greg went with me and had a really great time.  By the end of the night he was mixing it up too.  It was nice to see him meeting my new friends and liking them.  I was afraid that he wouldn't.  What fun we had.  We even danced.  He's thinking about volunteering to be on set crew for whatever show I get cast in next summer.  I'd really like for Madison to be in the same show I am.  A family thing...fun without the guilt.  Now there's a concept.   Kaitlyn - the female lead is 17.  She is about 5'4", white blonde long hair, blue eyes, a perfect smile.  She has a wonderful voice, sweet and syrupy.  She is innocent and fun.  Her acting ability astounds me, really.  There's a point in the show when her character has just broken things off with her man and she's singing "But Not For Me" and when she does the line "But I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss..." she very slowly raises her hand to her cheek in just the most perfect way.  The audience believes she's caught up in reverie and then her tears fall.  Made me cry the first time I saw her do it.  Well, I cry every time I hear that damn song.  I can only imagine how much life experience is going to make her a better actress.  She's trying to decide whether to go to college or just move to NYC and make a go of it.  I told her Carpe dieum baby.  College - you can always go to if you don't make it.  College can be a crutch because you're afraid to try.  She's good enough now.  She is a true triple threat.  Great dance technique, beautiful voice, and a sensitive actress.  The thing that really is best about Kaitlyn is that she is so down to earth.  She's just a teenager.  She doesn't put on airs and refuses to be treated like she's special.  I tease her about becoming a diva in training.  She calls me her tinkertwin - cause we both have Tinkerbell shirts.  Her laugh is like music.  She's one of those people that you're sure is destined for greatness.  Gosh, it's great to be involved in theatre again.  I am so much happier.  Mom-in-law's birthday is Saturday (NOTE TO SELF:  Buy something)

      Really, really, really fabulous. Opening night was a smash hit.  Standing ovation at the beginning of curtain call.  No set change disasters, no sound issues...the lighting computer did totally go beserk in the final two scenes but we were still lit - albeit not artistically unless you like strobe lighting.  But no one was injured and people laughed!   The moment Mark and I came on stage people laughed at us.  We are a pretty funny sight - 6'5" Mark and I in khaki and pith helmets.  The audience laughed at all of our lines in the right places even.  Before the show Brian, the director, gave me a note.  I had been ad libbing lines on my first exit - trying to incorporate lines from the other Theatre in the Park shows.  The other casts had used references to the other shows so I thought it was a part of the culture.  So the latest thing I was saying was "Eugene, now that we're not in Kansas anymore (Wizard of Oz) we should climb every mountain (Sound of Music."  To which he would answer "Patricia, do you think there are any hot box dancers in there? (Guys and Dolls)?"  Brian's not was not to adlib from the other shows - it screams community theatre.  Ouch.  He said think of something else.  I said hopefully "Something different every night?"  Now this was in front of the entire cast...."Sure, I trust you".  He smiled.  I said "Be afraid, be very afraid"  Laughter rang out.  The Stage Manager piped up "Yes, we are.  Val's first and last performance at Theatre In The Park"  Again laughter.  In conversation afterwards with the Stage Manager - we have deaf interpreters and they need to know what is going to be said beforehand to make sure they know how to sign or spell it.  Sigh....So I set it...and it's brilliant.  Here's the new bit....  We (Eugene and I) arrive in Deadrock to review the Lank Hawkins' (the bad guy)Hotel, Saloon and Restaurant.  We meet Lank and are motioned into the Saloon.  He has just spoken very bad  French with a Western drawl...we are very British.  Right after his very bad French I say..okay, I don't know how to spell it....Oh (over the top delight) parlevous Francais (rushing to him and pinching his cheek - as sickeningly sweet as possible) and then dash through the swinging doors (hoping not to injure myself or others - grateful Rissy isn't involved with the swinging doors).  Mark comes up to him in the same tone and says aurevoir and gives him a pat on the cheek.  The idea is born out of trying to annoy him which is a nice setup for what happens later between the characters.  No, not adlibbing and creating character development!  Brian loved it.  So after the show I found Greg and Danielle.  Danielle said "Mommy, look...Chin up."  Which is a line from my featured song and she did the choreography backwards.  I am still smiling at that image.  No flowers for me on opening night.  The first words he said were "Now what?"  No hug even.  He hasn't been feeling well all week though.  I forgot to remind him to get me flowers but dang...I shouldn't have to.  Don't all men know that opening night your lady should get flowers?  Expectations lowered...or spoken.  So I told him I'd really like flowers on closing night but not about my disappointment.  So I addressed the topic, Dr. Phil, but not the issue.  Am working up to it.  Saturday night's show was not quite as good but still fabulous.  The media was there and I'm looking forward to the reviews.  The sound had a lot of problems.  The guy who plays the lead, Jason, was sweating to death - 95+ degrees onstage and his mike kept shorting out because it kept getting wet.  They changed it 4 times.  Missed a lot of sound cues, but luckily it was on for all his songs.  Now about the heat - what are they bitching about, come on...they're not in corsets and chemises and long skirts...weenies.  ;)  I sing offstage during most of the production numbers which means my mike is on a lot.  Last night Mark and I sang the first part of a song and it sounded so good I turned to him and said "Dude, we so rock!"  He pointed at the mike.  DAMN!  Curse you Richards, Doom wanted to be mute!  At least I didn't curse.    Went to a cast party last night.  Great time...we sat around the piano and sang show tunes until 1:30AM.  I got to sing "Tell Me On a Sunday" from Song and Dance and "I Dreamed a Dream" from Les Mis and then Mark and I did some duets.  They kept asking me to sing...how could I say no...;)   Got a lot done around the house yesterday.  Really enjoying being home.  I bought coffee yesterday.  Bought some Fair Trade stuff from Guatemala...Arabica, maybe?  Anyway, I chose it based on smell.  Thought I'd try something new.  It's better than Folgers even.  Wonder how it would be if I reused the grounds?  hmmmm....naaaaaah!  ;)

      Why am I calm and serene?  Must be the lack of sleep.  Or the massage.  Yep, probably the massage.  Smartest move I've made in sometime getting a massage this morning.  Ah....  I found my wallet - all the stuff was in there!  Woo-hoo - no going to the DMV for me, thank you very much!  Heavens I'm so grateful to be doing a show again.  Elation just sitting around backstage.  I'm having so much fun.    I called to tell Danielle good night last night and she was already asleep [lucky thing!] and Greg told me she said the sweetest thing.  I told her last night was my last rehearsal for the rest of the summer and she told Greg when they got home that she couldn't wait to "give Mommy hugs and kisses whenever I want."  Awwwww.....  It's so nice to be loved.  I have finished a draft of the first chapter of *my great American novel* *smirk*.  One of my residents is going to read it for accuracy.  Gosh, I hope she likes it.  It takes place in a hospital - it's about a group of ob/gyn residents.  I thought I should write about something I know.  Am looking forward to spending time writing after the show closes.  This morning a gentle rain started to fall as I was driving in.  I rolled down my window and took a deep breath.  There is nothing like the fresh smell of rain on a summer day.    Rain?  SHIT!  Hope the show will still open tonight!  Crap, must go check the radar...  *lazzi*

      Got home from rehearsal last night at 2:30 am.  Got up to go to work today...no coffee.  I reused the grounds from yesterday.  *hanging head in shame*    The 20 showgirls first scene outfits were all too large.  I pinned one of them in and fixed the huge bow across her butt.  The next thing I know, there's a line of long legged beautiful girls waiting for me to *adjust* them.  I could only think about how jealous my husband was going to be when I got home.  *snicker*  So these sets are huge and the scene changes aren't going well.  One of the actors, Kurt goes out and talks to the director about making one of the scene changes during intermission instead of in a hurry at the top of the 'Entract.  He said no.  Kurt, Mark and I were bitching about it.  Pointing out how difficult it will be to get the logistics right with little or no rehearsal and how the stairs are dangerous until they are clamped.  Then the stage manager's voice came looming from above "Stop.  We'll have to start over someone is talking.  Patricia [that's my character's name]I think it's you, dear."  Gulp!  There should be a light come on when your mike goes live.  Luckily, I didn't say anything I wouldn't have said to the director.  I've learned that lesson from a friend and only recently.  We ran the number again.  Then the director announced we would do the scene change at intermission.  Later I found out he didn't hear our conversation but the stage manager used all our points in her *discussion* with him.  Safety first. ;)  The lights are going to be good, the costumes are fine, the dance numbers are fabulous and the leads are quite good.  I think the show is going to be wonderful.  It's the scene changes I worry about.  Hate to be run over by a big frame covered in Luan...death by veneer, if the coffee doesn't get me first.    One more day of bleary-eyed tiredness before I can rest.

      Tech week at Theatre in the Park consists of arriving at 6 PM to help clean up from a day of set construction.  Most of the sets in this show are larger than most of the apartments I've lived in.  Vocal warm ups, get miked, get in costume and then sit.  I am not complaining, really.  Monday night I sat from 7 PM till 1 AM and never got on stage.  Last night I finally got on around midnight.    I am the helpful sort...I find it difficult to sit still.  So I helped the sound guy adjust levels, costumers accessorize, moved hand props and the director even had me help reblock some stuff.  It's nice to feel useful and respected.  Last night when I walked out on that huge stage for the first time and looked out at the lights...well, gosh it felt like home.  This to me is performing.  This is where I belong.  It will be hard to go back to Renfest after this.  Took the girls home to Hannibal this past weekend.  Madison and I had just finished reading Tom Sawyer outloud and it was so much fun to watch her point out things from the book.  We lined the kids up in front of Twain's boyhood home by the fence and she insisted everyone pretend to whitewash.  It was a mostly great weekend filled with popsicles, water balloons, fireworks, BBQ and beer (lots of beer).  My brother is backsliding.  Some horrible moments, frankly I don't know how my parents stand it.  Their health is beginning to suffer.  I feel some action should be taken...I just don't know what. I think at this point all I can do is listen and hope that will be enough.  I have been out of touch mostly with my other family, Commedia.  The JOB show went well from what I understand.  Rehearsals are progressing well for KCRF.  Doubtful I'll make it to Bristol.  The hunger is gone.  I need a long break.

      But first my horoscope... Even if your logic is telling you one thing and your feelings are telling you something else, there is a solution to your dilemma. That famous Libran indecisiveness won't buy you any time today. You're going to have to make up your mind and stick with your decision. You'll be surprised at how others will come through for you now to help you make the changes that you desire in your life.  Oh great...I just love surprises (said dripping with Shrew-baby's sarcasm)  And now [drum roll] Babylon 5 Philosophy... "We create the meaning in our lives. It does not exist independently. Being Anla-shok does not mean worrying about what others will think about us. It does not mean deciding what to do based upon whether or not it serves our sense of ego or destiny. It means living each moment as if it were your last one. It means doing each right thing because it is the right thing. The scale doesn't matter. The where, the when, the how, or in what cause .. none of those things matter. In my life I've discovered very few truths. Here is the greatest truth I know: Your death... will have a meaning if it comes while you're in fullest pursuit of your heart." --Babylon 5, Season 5, "Learning Curve"  I have been so untrue to myself for so long.  I have become what my mother wanted me to be...married, nice home in the suburbs, two children and a dog.  I am living the American Dream.  So I ask myself, HEY SELF!  What is you really want out of life?  HEY SELF!  What makes you happy?  HEY SELF!  Why isn't that enough?  Because all I ever wanted was to sing.  A career in performance is an unsteady rocky road that petrifies me to the point of paralysis.  And as much as I enjoy doing improv I enjoyed doing *real* theatre so much more.  I truly love the people in commedia and I only stay to play with them.  It's time I changed my focus though.  I only have so much time to play cause being a wife and mother and residency coordinator and vice president of the PTA is all a part of me as well.  Finding balance for all those pieces is becoming more and more challenging.  And I don't think I can add a couple of community theatre shows on top of all those other committments without toppling the building that is my life.  I want someday to run my own theatre company.  A company on a gambling showboat that teaches history to interested students by day and provides excitement to those with a taste for whiskey, gambling and fine entertainment by night.  It's a dream I've had since I was a child on the Mississippi.  And one I find myself thinking of a lot more frequently these days.  A beautiful white boat with a red paddlewheel, balconies all around, and a calliope gently floating down the river.  You see, I like to be in control.  I like to be challenged.  I like learning.  And I like entertaining.  And for the first time in a long time I'm starting to think that I like me.

      My boss is a statistics uber geek.  We're working on my pet project - resident experience log database...mmmm....easily generated, concise reports, yummy....and he says...  "You *could* add additional categories to the Procedures Table but here's the danger."  Pause.  Pause.  Pause.  "I won't like it."  I'm so going to Chi his square.

      Suck.  Especially when they are right.   Inner Reflections  Also had my tarot cards done...here's a small exerpt... "The cards do not suggest reflection or thinking things through, but rather a curbing of natural tendencies, freeing oneself from obsessions, until new knowledge makes itself known, otherwise patterns of the past will leave the questioner on the outside, trudging alone, outwardly resolute but inwardly bitter and feeling betrayed."  So how many times have I used the phrase "trudging onward" lately?  Hmmmm?  Not that I will alter my course of life based on a tarot card reading...I just found it to be eerily accurate and it has given me a little to think about.  So daoism...  I am a leaf on the great river of life...a passionate, acting with no forethought kind of leaf...but a leaf just the same.  Letting go...is easier said than done.   More Talking Instead of Writing  ASSFBB and I were discusing writing last night.  She gives great constructive criticism.  Active/passive voice choices...Clarity, fluency and eloquence.  I feel like such the beginner...oh wait, I am!!!!  She says my writing is emotionally intense...huh, imagine that from me.  I like the process and discussions of writing.  I don't know if I'm any good at it.  But I'm enjoying it...and isn't that half the battle, anyway?

      On Saturday I met C at Joannes and we shopped for fabric and trim for bloomers for 2 1/2 hours.  She is sort of tall, about Shrew-baby's height, with honey brown long straight hair, large green eyes, a complexion like porcelain, generous lips and a beaming smile.  Her voice is like velvet and she has a simple, clear way of speaking but you can't help being somewhat mesmerized by the sound of her voice.  We're going to be virgins for Madame Red together, she and I.  But only on Sundays ;)   We giggled over ugly polyester fabric, we dreamed of taffeta, and squeeled over fringe.  She found blue and white fabric with cherubs on it.  Perfect bloomers for Angel.  We have the same tastes, she and I in fabric and trim.  We planned to meet on Sunday to make the bloomers at my house.  On Sunday I made the Angel bloomers.  They have pleated, crisp white fabric with a little touch of lace on the ends of the legs topped with a simple but elegant wide blue trim.  Pretty, comfortable and just right for Angel.  I can't help but wonder if I will ever wear them as Angel?  C arrived around 4.  We made two pairs of bloomers for her.  Hers are much fancier than mine as she has 4 types of trim on the bottom of her legs.  She looks quite wonderous in them.   We talked almost the entire time.  A shorthand has already developed between us.  We talked of where we grew up, what our passions are, a couple of influential people that have touched each of our lives.  She went to NYU and was an actress in NYC.  She now teaches communication to medical students.  She sings.  She dances.  She is spiritual in a pagan sort of way.  We got into a long discussion of religion, dare I say spirituality.  She recommended a book called "Spiral Dance", which I must get.  She told me about daoism and I must admit, I am very curious about this philosophy.  I am sure that I would have trouble following such a "go with the flow" kind of philosophy.  She described it as a leaf in the water just gently floating down the river not worring about the rock ahead.  The water will carry the leaf where it needs to go.  I was thinking, of course, as myself as the leaf trying to paddle desperately away *ROCK!!!!!  SHIT!!!!  HELP!!!*  So daoism probably more of a goal at this point.   A couple of things I want to remember about this experience is how quickly trust can develop between people of like minds.  It was an unsteady dance at first our conversation, and as we became more comfortable we continued to feel each other out, so to speak.  I am unusually good at making friends but never before have I experienced friendship where we shared matters of the soul and heart so very quickly.  The other thing I want to remember is the look of amusement that would cross her face every now and then...and it wasn't from something I said to be funny it was usually something about myself that I shared.  A look of amusement and acceptance and pleasure.  She takes joy in the personality of the person, not just in what they say.  We talked of sex:  attitudes, societal impacts, very briefly what we like, how we came to play whores at renfest [what we expect that experience will be like, what we want from that experience, fears and dreams].  She told me of a book called "The Story of O", which I really have to read as I have recently discovered the courage to like erotica.  She is married quite happily it seems.  And while I know much about her, I can't wait to discover more.  I have a feeling we will be lifelong friends, maybe.  Hmmm...maybe this daoism thing is easier than I thought.  Just be vague about everything...  There is so very much in the world that I know so little about intellectually speaking.  I am emotionally and intellectually a child.  But I do have lots of energy and passion to pour into such pursuits...I am happy to keep finding new doors to open, especially as some close behind me.  Less is more... The wheel of life continues to turn...  Am keeping reverie and sadness at bay...
