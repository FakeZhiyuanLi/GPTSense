      so i just found out that my friends wife is in anger management.  i guess she went all domestic violence on his ass.   she is about 5'2", weighs 95 lbs dripping wet, gorgeous features and figure and her new favorite word is "f***face".   kind of reads like a playmate of the month doesn't it?  "i like popcorn by the fire, long walks on the beach and screaming obscenities at my lover until the cops are called."    to me it sounds ridiculous and i want to laugh, but i hear it is an awesome force to be reckoned with, fearsome and terrifying when the storm is at top speed.  i guess that just goes to show you don't know a person until you've had to sign her up for anger management.

      so...I get the invite.  O my gosh, my very first opportunity to blog.  And I have nothing to say.....That should be a suprise, considering I am never at a loss for words.  But I am proud to be the one to deflower the creation of my dear friend Bizzy McKizzle.

        So I lent this guy at work my copy of Dave Sedaris'&nbsp; "Me Talk Pretty One Day".&nbsp; He still hasn't read it.&nbsp; He is reading some book about dealing with&nbsp;trauma.&nbsp; Well, he may be more enlightened at the end of that book, and a better person for reading it, but I can gaurauntee he will certainly laugh harder at my book   . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Anyway, I miss you Sonny.&nbsp; Life is not as colorful without you.&nbsp; Let's do lunch sometime, get the gang together and think of new reality shows to pitch to the networks.&nbsp; I need to laugh about&nbsp;"Just relax" and all that.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am going into withdrawal!&nbsp; I need my fix!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      So um....being stalked at the workplace is really not so much fun.  &nbsp; Is it bad that i actually feel unsafe and afraid at work?

      so i know it's only been a little over a week, but i'm thinking about givin' the old bloggy here a makeover...any suggestions, or do we like the Barbi pink?  OH, and check  urlLink this site  out...it's always a favorite of mine  and speaking of conservatives, i got an interesting e-mail from the John Kerry website, i guess Dub-ya's peeps had already put out a commercial dissing Kerry's v.p. choice way before the announcement was even made, that's sorta dumb.   anyway, back to feeding the llamas.  (oh, yeah hope everyone's first week back at school is a good'un)

      I'm watching  urlLink QEFTSG  and it's this poor sad chap that they're helping out, the guy has TOTAL attitude and has no social life. He doesn't go out to bars/clubs and he pretty much just works and stays at home. He has problems "meeting" people and has, like, zero social skills when it comes to guys. And hasn't been on a date in over 3 years.   I'm SO laughing at him and just as I'm about to call him a big fat loser...I realize...Ah well, who cares for reality TV anyway.   Now back to that gallon of Ice Cream I was working on.  Which reminds me...how come when you eat a half a container of Ben & Jerry's you're a pig, but when you eat the whole thing you're a " VICTOR "?

      Are you ever talking and you feel like all the person you are speaking with is hearing is the Charlie Brown Adult Voice:  "Wah wah wah, wah wah?"    That was my day with my employer.  She saw the lips moving, but didn't get the message.  I am going to quit my job.    Sometime next March...after graduation...after I find gainful employment....
