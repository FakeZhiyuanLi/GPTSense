      Check it out!!!!....My bitch ass upstairs neighbors called the cops on me again. Apparently I was too loud again. I went to sleep with my music playing, but it was too loud for there sensitive ears. Today is the day I move out of this building. In about 20 minutes or so, I'm going upstair sto have it out for the last time with the cop callin' bastard above. Both of the officers had been to my place the last time the bastard called the cops. This guys kids are loud as fuck all day long, from about 5am to 11pm, yet I don't call in the law. I'm not a bitch see. SO the cops were cool, one said "Last time I was here, there was a lot of pot smoke.". We all got a good laugh off that one. I had on my T-shirt that says "Hardcore," and the sweatshirt that says "Drunk.". What a combo for a police visit. One cop asked me to show the other my shirts. I got $35 disorderly conduct citation in the end. But for the most part, I had a good night.

      The following things about last night "roxass":  The Tamales, the eye patch, The Hunns!!!!!!!, the shopping cart Dan and I stole and rode all down Fullerton taking turns switching of "riding" and "driving" positions, The multiple shots of Jameson's I proceeded to have even after James had gone home, and last but most definitely the FLASH FUCKING TACO AT 3AM!

      Yesterday was the first company softball game I was able to make, and we kicked ass! Now, I'm kinda sore from the game, but it was worth the win. Also today, Bevin took me to Second City. It was my first time goin' there, and it was great. I gotta go back to that place really soon. The actors were great, and the show was pretty damn funny at parts. The 3rd act of the show, was 100% improv, and pretty fuckin' funny too.

      I think I'm now recovered from the infamous all day hangover. Gotta give the drinking a rest for a few days. Tuesday and Wednesday were a wild ride. I think I met Anne Murray, or something like that. I sat at a bar right next to a Jameson tap. You gotta love any bar that has good old fashioned Irish fightin' whiskey on tap. I had my camera but didn't take many pictures.

      Speaking of "the courtship of Eddies Father", the new singer of the Dead Kennedys is Brandon Cruise (aka the little kid from the courtship...) and when I went to see them after the show everyone was coming up saying what an awesome job they did blah blah blah and my drunk ass kept shouting "Hey....remember when you were in "the courtshipt of Eddie's Father" ......... I know......... sungtines I'm just a little bit cooler than everyone else!

      The theme song from the show "The Courtship of Eddies Father" was just going thru my head. I don't know why though. But, ppl let me tell you 'bout my best friend. And why Can't I find the theme to the Rockford Files anymore. That shit roxass. Jane, I know you got the Agnew, but don't be a stranger.

      Have you ever had one of those days that you spend by your self not doing a whole lot just enjoying the relaxation and it isn't until you go to tell the man you just bought watermellon from, "thank you" that you realize you have not said one word the entire day and the very sound of your voice sounds weird and foreign and you decide there are some days things would just be better off not daying anything at all?..........

      Dena How was the boil w Dickie Duncan??? I'm pissed I didn't go but I think I needed some rest.  I think I have the second coming of the bubonic plague.  I woke up this morning and again had no voice, then proceeded to cough up not one or two but 8 large green items.  I think I'm gonna walk on down to the beach with Angus and hope either a stray bus comes to put me out of my misery or the invigorating non salt water air mysteriously cures me.

      I watched Kill Bill Vol. 1. It was pretty good. Vol 2. made alot more sense after that. I also Ate four tacos and pizza, and some liquor. I also called off work for the purpose of screwing over the lazy bitch that I work with. The hotel was at 100% today, and they could have really used me, but fuck 'em. Key thing...Don't piss me off.

Call me fucking juvenile but anytime I hear someone say the work "poontang" I almost piss myself from laughing so hard... Ok I'm easily amused and I will never let my fourth grade sense of humor die...... Going to drink more cough syrup now  -- James - sorry I "bailed" on you last week motto for tomorrow is "Jane shall not drink tequila before the sun goes down" -- I think that will fix things.

      Ok there is an upside to being sick ..... That being, you can have the most insane thoughts and not think twice about it ..... So here are the random thoughts I'm having right now (watch out for the mucus).....Oranges are the best thing in the world......My dog barks too much...... Mayonnaise is sick and fucking gross...... Maybe I'm a guy trapped in a girls body ..... Maybe not ..... Then again maybe...... Ok no totally not cause then I'd have to be gay cause I like guys and I think girls are dumb......Peeing upright would be the shit though....... DAMN my dog is cute....... Who ever made bacon that has a shelf life of over 6 months w/out refrigeration is really fucking gross.........Wait a minute I think bacon all together is gross....... Why don't people wear the macaroni necklaces they made in grade school anymore..........Will someone please punch Walter Jacobson?.........Going to drink lots tomorrow...... Nothing new there.......................

      Today I ducked outta work early and went to the movies and saw Kill Bill Vol.2. I still have yet to the Kill Bill Vol.1. Anyway, the movie was pretty good, but Quetin Tar..whatever the fuck seems to be quite full of himself and it comes out in his movies. I still wanna see Vol.1. I mean, you can't watch Temple of Doom, and not see Raider of The Lost Ark Damnit!!! Whats Empire Strikes Back without Star Wars!?!? CRAP!!! Thats what! Anyway....  I later in the day went to the Sovereign. Bevin was bartending, Cali and Aaron were also there, and Jay was drunk as a circus monkey with a pistol. A little later Laurence showed up. It was kinda funny how there were only 4 regulars in the place at the time. Things have changed a lot there.   Two Australians were in the bar also. They taught me the phrases: Dry as a Nuns nasty I'm so hungry I could eat the crouch of a low flying duck and I'm so hungry I could eat a horse and chase the jockey  All and all, it was a good day.

Also, I'll wear a white shirt if I damn well please! I love black but I'm not Johnny Cash. Wish I had a knife on me last night. It would have made some things a whole lot easier.

          I realized today that I'm alway angry. I've known it for a long time, but never really acknowledged it. I might be drunk right now, or I might be on to something. Wait......I know I'm drunk now.       Well, hopefully tomorrow is gonna be a better day. I kow I didn't get into what happened today to piss me off, but it doesn't matter. Saturday I'm gonna hang out with Jane and her friend Spero, so  know I'm gonna have fun. Spero I'm not sure if I met. (You know "sober half the time." or by Jane "!/4 of the time." But Jane roxass and thats all that counts.

      So last night, after spending some quality time with my favorite dog, angus, and having a couple of glasses of wine with jane, ivan and i went to the beach with a bottle of wine, it was nice, the moon was full and it was a pretty clear night. we left when we saw the cops in a parking lot a little further down, when we got back to the car we were blocked in by an suv, i could see some movement in the driver's seat, this is also when we noticed the driver had his seat back and his hand above his head, when we started the car, a girls head popped up. nice, that's class right there, getting head at the beach, very nice, glad we saw it.

      Dena I appreciate the "sober half the time" comment -- but I think on behalf of you james and I it may need to be "sober 1/4th of the time"  (note: so long as the first tuesday of the year does not fall below the average daily barometric pressure of the preceding saturday, in that case the sobriety factor would decrease to .2341 instead of the traditional .25)

      Today I showed up for work late, but I kicked ass when I got there. Before I knew it, the day was over. Then it was time for Calico James (aka Redbull The Pirate) to go out and live it up. I sent a hail out to Jill, Jane, and Dena, and only Jane replied. So Jane and I went to Lyons Den to check out M.O.T.O. Only M.O.T.O roxass. The rest of the bands (except Manhandlers) sucked ass.  I think Paul got kicked out for being a one man mosh pit. If you don't know Paul, then well.....fuck it...nevermind. In the end, me and Jane hit Flash Taco. (HARDCORE!!!) Then home was the destination. As Ice Cube Said, "Today was a good day.".  Oh Yeah...Did I forget to mention Jane is fucking HARDCORE!!!!

      Good to have a day off. It's been a crazy week since last Wednesday, but at least I made it to Flash Taco. Hardcore!! Feels good to be outta Egdewater too. Me and Dena both turned that page in our lives at the same time. I might drop thru the Sov this Thursday, Joni brought me back a gift from Hawai'i that I need to pick up.

      Oh no!  Dr. Drinking was on call last night!!  Huge bruise on my knee pinched nerve by my shoulder and strained vocal chords from really really really bad really really really loud singing.  Oh well, had lots of fun and I think it got me out of the really bad mood I was in yesterday.  Dena how did we get that drunk (cause dovie and I were at the staggering point) of just beer?  No booze, shots or anything else?  Just Beer!?!?!

      So I've been checking out the Weatherbug for Colorado next week. It's calling for lows in the 30's and 40's every night next week. I've never been there in the summertime, quite a few times in the wintertime. In the winter it doesn't seem that cold because of the humidity (or lack therof) but still yikes, that's kind of chilly.    I've been doing good with the slowing down of drinking, I took six whole days off and let my stomache heal. I've gone out a couple of times since than and think I might have this moderation thing down. I've decided that shots are my enemy! As I say this I just had a daydream of me and a shot glass in gorilla combat. ha!

      tonight is my first night of going out while being on the wagon. I'm going to try to stay on for atleast a week. Vomitting blood is not fun. At all. If that's not a sign to slow down on the hooch, I don't know what is.

      Ok, this is funny. I'm bored, it's friday night and all i'm doing is fucking around online. For some reason I decide to take an aptitude test, I just dropped out of school for design and this is what the response was:   dena, your heart's desire is Design and the Arts  You have a number of attributes that make you an excellent candidate for a design or artistic-related career. You understand how important it is to follow your heart, express your feelings, and do what you love, so it's likely you're already in a design-related field or have created a way to make your non-design-related job more artistic and expressive.  If you're currently stuck in a job that does not allow you to throw your heart into your work, it's likely you're an unhappy soul and are not living your life's purpose. Until you get yourself back on track, the life you dream of may never arrive.   how weird is that?

Leaving the 2nd and coming back the 6th, kind of a short trip, but that's when Ivan can get off of work. So excited!  i think that may be the most i've ever used exclamation points in my life!!!!!

      Thanks to Jane and Jill for the party last night.  I haven't played circle in years, also, turning catch phrase into a drinking game was a swell idea. Drinking nightly for almost a week is not a swell idea. Last night I had dreams of getting stuff done today, don't think that's going to happen. Maybe after the sun goes down, that might make it a little easier on me, urgh.

      Dread Pirate Cash    Like the famous Dread Pirate Roberts, you have a keen head for how to make a profit. You're musical, and you've got a certain style if not flair. You'll do just fine. Arr!

      So is there a B Plan for if it rains tomorrow? I might be a girl of many  hats, but I don't have a sombrero, sorry Jane, how about a good ol cowboy hat?    Mad Bess Flint   Every pirate is a little bit crazy. You, though, are more than just a little bit. Like the rock flint, you're hard and sharp. But, also like flint, you're easily chipped, and sparky. Arr!        I AM 83% PUNK ROCK!

        Jane:  Your pirate name is:  Iron Anne Flint  A pirate's life isn't easy; it takes a tough person. That's okay with you, though, since you are that person. Like the rock flint, you're hard and sharp. But, also like flint, you're easily chipped, and sparky. Arr!  \http://www.fidius.org/quiz/pirate.php
