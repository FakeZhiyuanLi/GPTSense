      Just great.. I'm out of source material for my research paper, so I'm going to have to go to the library again tomorrow to finish up.  Hopefully I can get it done tomorrow, since I still have one other paper due, and only two weeks of school left.

      Not much to say in the past couple of days.. we went to Brian's house in Texas for Thanksgiving, stayed about 9 hours or so.. all in all, it was a good day.  Got to get out of the house, good food, some company on what would have otherwise been a pretty lonely day.  Asked him to pray for us to find my ring, and while we haven't looked yet, it hasn't shown up yet, either.  We're not quite halfway through all the boxes that need to be examined, but we just don't feel like looking anymore.  The more likely side of the room has already been gone through, and I don't know about Diamond, but I'm just a mite discouraged.

      Oh, and still no dice on my ring.  More boxes yet to sift through, but... it's not in the carpet, which would have been the most likely place, I think.

      Finally got what I think is a decent name for this thing.  I came up with this name a couple years ago, but stopped using it after I did a search and came up with literally hundreds of hits where other people had come up with the same thing.  I stopped using it, deciding that I'd rather find something original, but now I stop and think; "When I thought it up, it was original for me.  Yes, others have had the same thought I have, but that does not detract from the fact that I didn't see it before I thought of it."  So here it is.  My own digital abyss.

      I really wish I could find my wedding ring.  Diamond lost it back in September, and we're going through the study tonight; removing every box, dumping it out, sifting through  everything  and scouring the carpet underneath.  I want it back.  Now.

      Cool!  I got one of those stupid fliers in the mail.. you know.. you've been pre approved for a car loan crap.. but it also had a scratch off guaranteed win game card.  It had the usual crap.. 5$, 20$ of gas.. but it also had a couple of decent prizes, too.  It just so happens I got the second place one, a 1000$ online shopping spree.  I knew there was a catch.. there had to be.. 1000$ on a 2000$ order, or you have to sit through a seminar on car buying.. something like that.  Turns out, the catch is two-fold.  First, you have to pay a "shipping and handling fee" for each item.  Individually.  There is no singular S&H fee like from real shopping sites, there's a fee on each item.  They're not too bad, though, considering the quantity of merchandise we can obtain.  But...  Second, the site is crap.  They've got a total of  maybe  150 different things, no video games, no books, not even a VCR.. and of the items they do have listed, about half are "temporarily" out of stock.  Still though, there are a few nice things.  A cordless 3/8" drill, of which I actually have need.. a spiffy leather trenchcoat, and some decent gift items.  It won't be a perfect Christmas, as of course they don't have anything that's on anyone's lists, but hopefully the items are of decent quality, as opposed to cheap dollar store knockoffs.

      Well, Brian and Cassy are gone, and now it's nothing but old people and their grandkids in church.  Everyone knows, or at least should know by now, considering all the questions we've been asked (on a weekly basis sometimes), that  we're not staying .  In six and a half months we'll be gone, too.  Actually closer to six months now.  We tell them we traveled 900 miles to come here only so I can go to school.  We have no family here, we have no established friends here, I am not here to start a life, or a family, or a business.  When school's out,  we're gone .  I don't know why these people continue to insist that we have kids, or start a business here, or find work here.   I don't want to stay here, Diamond doesn't want to stay here,  WE ARE NOT STAYING HERE!

      Well, yesterday was fun.  Spent most of the day helping Brian lay carpet and install cabinets in the new building for the church.  Not too bad a deal, though, I got lunch for me and dinner for the both of us out of the deal.  Kind of fun, too, and it's work that's got me looking forward to building my own home some day.  Fired off an email to Ian today, so I can have info to get a couple resumes out and hopefully generate two interviews during the week we're out visiting them.  I'm not  trying  to get back to Alabama, but I know there's work there.

      I put  waaaay  too much wax on my receiver.  It's ok, the Acraglas set up fine, and the surfaces are large enough without too many cavities to cause a problem, but next time, less is more.  Which isn't to say that I had problems removing it from the stock; far from it.  I practically looked at it and the receiver slid out just fine.  No cracking, no peeling, no sticking.  I'm guessing Mike got a ride back to Arkansas, as I didn't see him yesterday afternoon, nor today.  Hopefully I can get my receiver and stock inlet over Thanksgiving break, and with a little luck I can have a good recoil pad ordered and in my hands the day we get back to class.  I didn't even think about the fact that the ones I have on hand have the ugly white line spacers, so I can't use any of them.  With the inletting for my bolt handle complete, and the pad in hand, I'll have my sanding and the first coat of oil done on my wood stock next Monday, with the rest of the week available for me to finish up the oil coats.  One Monday, two days to dry, one Wednesday, one Thursday, and one Friday, to be cleaned up over the weekend and ready to hand in on the last Monday of class.

      Haven't left for school yet, but I discovered something highly annoying last night.  My new CSS website displays properly when viewed from my harddrive in both Netscape and IE, but after uploading to Fortunecities, it only displays properly in Netscape; IE displays nothing except FC's ad banner.  Of course they're going to make sure their own banner works fine, what I want to know is what's causing it to strangle my page in IE.

      I'll find out tomorrow how my bedding job went, as it's drying tonight.  Also, my bolt doesn't look spectacular, but it looks a far cry better than it ever has.  Pictures coming soon.  No idea what's up with Mike over the holidays, as Kelly was going to give him a ride to Arkansas, but Kelly's wallet came up short for his own trip, so Mike can't tag along.  I told Mike that if he's around for the holidays, Diamond's boss gives us a turkey every Thanksgiving (gives all their employees turkeys, actually, we're not their personal charity case or anything, though I don't think I'd complain if we were).

      Mike's back, working, but I don't know for how long.  My Diamond didn't give me a goodbye kiss this morning.. /sigh.. on mornings that I don't have to be at school at 8 (thus requiring me to get up and out the door early) she comes back and makes sure I'm awake, says goodbye, etc.  I guess she was just in a hurry today.  Our synthetic stocks are supposedly due Friday.. I'm going to try to get the receiver bedded today, and if I'm lucky, the barrel bedded tomorrow, but I kinda don't think I'm going to have it ready.  Oh well, it's a simple enough process, it's just getting it right, and letting the Acraglas dry (10+ hours, 2.5 days to fully set) that's going to slow me down.  I need to get my receiver and stock inletted for my bolt handle before the weekend.  Next week: Thanksgiving Break!  Counting the weekends, I have 9 days of home.. wee.. I'm going to have to get my research paper done next week.. no ifs, ands, or buts about it.

      I worry about Mike.. he's failed a couple of classes this semester, and after a few of us in class have told him over and over again to stop worrying about women so much, to come to class and work instead of procrastinating... he hasn't been in class in over a week, but promised that he'd be in tomorrow.  Hopefully they'll allow him to remain for next semester.  He may have done a stupid thing this fall, but I like Mike.. he's a good friend, and I'd really hate to see him have come this far only to fall short of the last semester of the course.  Granted, he's already out of the running for a degree, but there's still the option of the certificate, and then there's the knowledge available to him whether he gets either the degree or the certificate.  I hope they let him stay.

      I can't believe I forgot the OSGA meeting yesterday.  I'm secretary for the student government here on campus, and way back in September when we all went to the Leadership conference in Oklahoma City, Joanna, our illustrious leader, volunteered our school (without discussion among the rest of student government, or the dean of student affairs) to host the Oklahoma Student Government Association this month.  So she sticks her nose out, trying to take charge and make us look impressive and show off and... our student government sucks, she's the only one who wanted them to come, and guess what?  She's the only one who attended yesterday!  Granted, I in all honesty had completely forgotten about it, but I don't know what happened to Melinda, and why she didn't attend.  Suffice to say, I think Joanna is a little pup who's trying to play with the big dogs.  A little two year college in some po-dunk town in the middle of Nowhere with nothing to do except look at cracking sidewalks and 100 year old buildings that are still, for some reason, being used to hold classes in, has no business hosting a state's student government meetings for one month.  She did this, and dragged people from all over the state, some of them 4 - 5 hours away, to come and hold a meeting and then tour the campus to look at said cracked sidewalks, and cow plop.  Yes, cow plop.  Joanna decided that it would be interesting to take them back to the Vet Tech area and show them around the barn where the...  people  around here place bets on which square a cow will deposit on.  I keep trying to remind myself that we only have six and a half months left in this state, in the worthless house, in this next to nothing town.

      I've decided to move my page from Angelfire to Fortunecities for a couple of reasons.  First, Angelfire has never been friendly to my FTP program (I use the command line FTP that comes with Windows).  Second, they've deteriorated to the point where they now insert banners AND pop ups on every page; Fortunecity just has banners.  The offset those banners induce on my pages is going to require some finagling and probably the use of stylesheets to get my page to an acceptably presentable state, which means I'm going to have to learn stylesheets.  While not in and of itself a bad thing, I'm annoyed because it's going to slow me down.  Still, though, it's probably for the best.

      Matrix: Revolutions didn't suck too bad.  I actually kind of liked it.  It was, without doubt, better than Reloaded, at least, and the soundtrack was better, too.  A sure rating of the soundtrack will have to wait until I actually have it to listen to.  In any case, if you haven't seen it, and you were a fan of either of the first two movies (or both) I would recommend going to see Revolutions.  Braum's has their Pumpkin and Egg Nog milkshakes available again.  We got one of each and constantly swapped them back and forth on the way home from the grocery store.  I love egg nog, and I love pumpkin pie.. asking me to decide which is my favourite is like asking a parent to decide which of their two children they love best.  Of course, I did not father egg nog or pumpkin pie, and of course that analogy bars the possibility that one child is an evil demon spawn, but it doesn't really matter.  They're both awesome!  If you're fortunate enough to live near a Braum's, you know what I'm talking about.. otherwise you're probably stuck with the egg nog shakes from Sonic, which are quite good in their own right.  When we finally get out of Oklahoma, I think Braum's is about the only thing I'm going to miss.

      Awesome.. got my art blog up and running, though it's still kind of ugly.  I can't stand  any  of the available templates they have for our use.  But anyways, it is, of course, graphics intensive, so for those of us (yes, myself included, I'm a poor college student) who are still on dialup, I'm archiving on a weekly basis.  Tomorrow morning I'm heading out to the church to help pack the pastor's belongings and clean up the new building.  We're getting a new building put in beside the old one (and I mean the  old  one).  I swear, the building has to be at least 100 years old.  Brian (the pastor) is trying to encourage the congregation to move sanctuary service into the new building, but I doubt it will happen.  There's like, 40 people that attend each Sunday, and aside from a dozen kids and teens, the pastor and his wife (who themselves have three of the dozen) and the two of us, everyone there is at least 50.  So, it's likely we'll stay in the old building, with its termite infested stairwells, zero (0) handicap ramps (the sanctuary is on the second floor), and otherwise musty atmosphere.  The old fellowship hall was taken out I think in May or April of this year to make way for the new building, which was supposed to be up no later than September.  The contractor took too many jobs, dragged his heels, fiddled around, and now it looks like the new building won't be finished until December.  Which brings about a whole new problem; Brian (our aforementioned pastor) announced two weeks ago that he has accepted a pastorship at a church somewhere in Texas, I forget the name of the place, but it's about two hours away.  Anyways, he told everyone he's planning on staying until the new building is totally finished, which of course everyone thought would be.. um..  now  so he told the new church that the first day he'll be up on the pulpit would be the first Sunday in December, so.. the feces has struck the rotating oscillator.  Tomorrow, though, is the day I get to put things behind me for a little while at least.  We're going to see The Matrix: Revolutions.  LSDiamond liked the first one, as did I, but she really liked the second one, too.  I was..  less  than enthusiastic with it.  So, we head off valiantly to the third and final (?) installment of what has been an awesome piece of sci-fi eye candy with a soft, chewy plot center.  We both go in with high hopes and fingers crossed, and tomorrow we shall see what... ah, crap, what are their names?  The two brother guys, I don't care to look it up right now..   ...we shall see what the two brother guys have to offer in closing.  Oh, by the way, I'm actually listening to the soundtrack for Reloaded right now.. sad, really, not only was the first movie better, the first movie's  soundtrack  was better, too.

      So often I begin something, and though I like to have a plan of attack, rarely do I set goals for a project.  Such as it is with this blog, though I suppose the only real goal is to record thoughts and ideas.  Lately we've been shaping wood rifle stocks to fit our receivers and barrels, and I've actually come to enjoy the work, and I've found that I do have some latent ability for it.  This pleases me.  Considering my apparent aptitude for custom gunsmithing work (a 3 dimensional field) and my interest in art (of the 2 dimensional variety), I've decided to start an art blog to document my progress and accomplishments in drawing.  As soon as I'm through with this post, actually, I'm going to set it up.  My intent will be to draw at least one sketch per day, which will be posted on my art blog.  I'll likely try to set up a forum for it as well, though I'm not really sure on this point.  I may make my email (or an email) address available through which I may be contacted for comments instead.

      Well, she just came in the door.  I'm trying to bite my tongue, I don't want to spoil what has probably been a fun night for her.  I did get into my Yahoo! mail and thought to look in the Trash folder; the email she sent me with a cell phone number was still there, I called about 30 minutes after the last post, and found out what was going on.  I'm still feeling a bit sick

      Look how late, and my Diamond's still not home  I wonder if she reads this  I wonder if she realizes how sick I've been for the past week since I found out she'd been considering leaving me, all because I read  urlLink her blog.   She wasn't talking to me.. she never told me there was a problem, and I later find out that what I read was supposed to be in her private journal, rather than her public one (the fault lies with LiveJournal, not with me snooping around her private stuff).  How am I supposed to do anything when she's hiding stuff like this from me?  She says everything's getting better now.. she says we'll be ok, but it's a quarter after 12 in the morning, and she's not home.  I don't want to believe that she'd leave without letting me know, not after I found out and I'm making a concerted effort to do better, after 6 years of marriage and our almost daily reiteration of our promises to one another.  I wonder if she realizes that she's tearing me apart

      Bored out of my gourd in the school library, working on my research paper for English (Medieval Melee Weaponry, if you care) and contemplating going home to finish.  The catch is, I'm technically a student tutor and I'm on the clock, but Thursday nights like this one are usually lacking in.. shall we say.. the studious students.  I count 13 people in here, on a campus of 2,000.

      Not too bad.. I checked with Financial Aid today, and I'm eligible for another 650$ per semester, and I might be able to get Fall's portion before Thanksgiving.  I'm thinking 400$ for the pistol, and the rest towards a couple books, recoil pad jig, and a couple other odds and ends.  The 650$ from next semester going towards the trigger, grip safety, and sights, maybe a scope for my rifle, and after that, we'll see.  I'm still not sure how we're going to fund a move next May, but I'm planning on doing work study next semester, too, so.. we'll see what comes of that.

      Diamond is talking with a friend now.. one she hasn't seen in years, but who she keeps in contact with over the net.  As soon as she gets back with the truck, I'm going to go get a haircut and head out to Decatur.  It's not so much that my hair is long, but I've cut my own hair for the past 9 or 10 months, and while it's short enough and pretty clean, it is a little shaggy, but I want to look my absolute best when I go to meet Mr. Vaughn.  I called him this morning around 9:00am, and they weren't open even though he and at least one employee were present.  He sounded somewhat annoyed while talking to me, but Dadoo said he'll have probably forgotten by the time I show up.  I hope so.. I really want this job.  Anyways, time for breakfast.

      Not trying to abandon this, not in the least.. I'm still in Alabama, and I'm really missing everyone here.  I didn't realize how much I missed everyone and how much I really want to come back here, but.. I do.  I can not believe how much I'm wanting to come back.. I'm asking everyone to pray for me in my interview  tomorrow .. I called Friday, and it was too busy a day for him to get in an interview with me, so he asked if I could come in on Tuesday.  Needless to say, since Diamond and I had already talked this over, I told him that it could be arranged no problem, so Diamond missed work today, and will be missing work tomorrow also, but I hope and pray, and I'm begging God to grant me this job, so that we can come back.  We received some of the MechWarrior dial units for Christmas, and we played a game Friday night, a learning game, really, and it was fun, but we went over to Maalac's today and played for about six hours, a 600 point game, but it was loads of fun.  I desperately miss everyone here, and if I can get a job offer for May, then there will be no question of where we're going, and we'll actually have something to start looking forward to.  I haven't wanted something this badly since Diamond and I were contemplating marriage.  This.. this job, or something like it.. this is a necessity.

      Well, Horizons is toast.. I can't even get into the game anymore.  After the splash screen, right when I'm supposed to be entering the game, the whole program closes without an error message.  I've fought with this since Thursday, and I opened a case Thursday night, also, and have yet to receive any response from AE on this issue.  Their customer support sucks worse than Verant's did, but I'm hoping this is just start up pains, and it will probably only get worse over Christmas as all sorts of frickin' noobs get computers and Horizons for Christmas and they're all morons, but.. we all started there at some point.  At least I don't have to deal with their stupid questions this time.  Anyways, everyone is telling me I need to upgrade to Windows XP, so we're going to get a copy of that burned to CD over vacation and I'll try that and see if that works.  If not, I don't know what I'm going to do.. WinME has worked fine ever since we got it, all of my other games work, heck, even Linux works for the most part now..  I have waited three years for Horizons, and now this.. this just sucks in so many ways..

      I'm still absorbed in Horizons, and I'm fighting with video issues tonight.. the screen goes all haywire, the textures all go to pot, polygons shoot out at me like telescoping pyramids and everything is just fubar.. I'm downloading new drivers now, but..  I must admit, I'm kind of losing interest in this blog.  Sure, it's great to go back and see my thoughts and everything, but I've never really suck with a journal, even though I've started three or four in my life.  This time, though, I want to keep up with it.. don't ask me why, I have no idea, I just...  want to .  But then, I want Horizons to work properly, too.  On a happy note, Diamond isn't working next Wednesday, so that means we'll be leaving for Alabama Tuesday night after she gets out of work, so yay!  We don't have to be driving on our anniversiary, and we get to see everyone for at least one extra day.

      I've been lost in Horizons for days now.. it's gorgeous, except for a few minor bugs which will undoubtedly be worked out soon.  My dragon is level 14 now.. not nearly the highest in the land, but still considerable.. and I'm level 6 in crafting.  Hopefully I'll be able to make scales and spells for myself before too much longer.  Well, Diamond isn't getting any extra time off at Christmas because Mark and Sherry want to be jerks about it.. there won't be anything for her to do, but "it's company policy that no time off is given around the holidays".  This is a newspaper in a rinky-dink worthless town, yet my mom, who works at a national grocery store chain, is getting a week off over Christmas break.  It's usually the major corporations like that which come across as the uncaring behemoth.  But nobody in town likes Mark and Sherry anyways, supposedly.. now I see why.  Oh well.. I'll do what I can in setting up an interview with JC's and Wiley's.

      Well, Horizons finally started working this morning, and of course I signed up to be in the library today, thinking that there might be someone here that needed help with Powerpoint, and that I wanted another 24$ in my paycheck this January, but come on.. there's nobody here!  My dragon is level 6 now, and I'd really rather be home getting him up to level 10 so I can start on the quests.  So many of them look really awesome as far as the bonuses to stats go.  Ah, well.. three more hours.

      Well isn't this just friggin' peachy... I get home, and wait four hours for the login problems to be resolved, and once I actually, finally, get into Horizons, the tutorial section runs fine, no lag, excellent framerate... all is well....   I get out and into the real world, and I've got about a 20 second lag, and after about three minutes, the game closes and I get an error message saying that I haven't received communication from the server for 120 seconds, and the game has shut itself down.   Linkdead ???  I am very disappointed in the reliability of the servers thusfar, but it's a beautiful game.

      Time to buckle down and get this page looking exactly how I want it.  I've decided to move my artlog over and combine it with this one, so I'll probably also move to thumbnail images to conserve bandwidth for those who could give a flying flip.  This blog is hosted on my website at  urlLink Fortunecities .

      My copy of Horizons should be here tomorrow.  Ian says it's like they took the best of DAoC and EQ and threw it into a blender.  I'm really excited.. FedEx shipping says it hit Ft. Worth this morning at 11am, so it'll be in my hands tomorrow, too bad I volunteered to work in the library tomorrow afternoon.  Ah, well.. I'll have tomorrow night, and I've got a month of Christmas vacation.

      Woo hoo!  Blogger is finally back up!  All I was getting is "document contains no data" errors from the site this morning, but anyways...   Go see  The Last Samurai !!!!   This movie is  awesome .  The previews don't do it justice, especially the silent one, since it gives you absolutely NO indication what the movie is about.  But I guarantee, you need to see this movie.  The preview hints at a romance for Cruise's character, but there really isn't anything.  I can't tell you why the woman is dressing him or even who she is without giving away part of the movie, but suffice to say, this is NOT a love story whatsoever.  I implore you, please go see this movie on the big screen if you can.  The sheer beauty of the landscape alone is worth the price of admission.  The story is rich and righteous, the acting is absolutely flawless, and while there are one or two plot holes, I find they can easily be overlooked for the sake of the film.  This movie is absolutely in my top five, and quite possibly my favourite movie of all time.  I'm having trouble deciding if I like this, or  The Shawshank Redemption  better.. for now, though, it's a tie.

      Got Diamond's old hard drive installed on my system.. hopefully all it needed was the jumper.  Found out that she may have to be back to work the Monday after Christmas, which will cause major problems with my intent to try and get an interview with Wiley's and/or JC's the week after.  A lot of my stuff that's due tomorrow isn't done, but I'm going to try and get into the classroom tomorrow morning around 7:30 or 8:00 and get as much done as I possibly can.  I'm lacking my checkering and two recoil pads, which I may be able to get the pads in next week, I just don't know.  I've got two more polishing projects that need to be done, and I know I'm not going to get them done, but one of them is going back to a guy Diamond works with.  Hopefully he won't mind getting his gun back next semester.  I listened to some song on the way home from school tonight.  You know how sometimes you'll listen to a song without actually  listening  to it?  I'd heard this one before, a couple of times, but I actually listened to the words this time.  Talking to women about how if your man messes up you gotta hit 'em up, get a hold of his cash and spend every last dime for all the hard times..  ideologies like this one disgust me.. it's people like this that are the cause of the disgusting state of affairs this country.. this world.. is in.

I think I'm going to change my blog host in the near future.

      Wow.. it hardly seems like a week has passed since last I posted.  Anyways, this past week has been pretty busy.. I've gotten two papers for Comp II done, my rifle is almost completed, though my bottom metal is in severe need of help.  I can not weld, no matter how hard I try, no matter how many times I attempt, and every time I try, it makes me sicker to see my failures.  I've asked my instructors for advice, and I'm given the same advice every time, and I apply that advice every time, and every time I come out with the exact same results.  I am a failure.  I don't know when our pistols will get here, but I need to get to work on my projects for Bohon's class.. Thursday is pretty much an all day lab, except for the hour first thing in the morning where he wants to talk.. he can't just let us work sometimes, he always,  always  has to talk.  I like Mr. Bohon, I really do, but his attitude this semster is just grating.  We go into the shop, no one is in there, Everett (the lazy sod that he is) says it's fine, gives us the tooling, and lets us get to work, and Bohon storms in 10 minutes later when he sees people in there, "Get out, this is my class time, I have a class coming in here and we need these machines."  An hour and a half later, when we could have been working this whole time, his class finally comes in, after he has no doubt been.. yep, you guessed it.. talking.  I only have about 62 days of class left, and I am really looking forward to getting out of here.  98 days until I Escape from OK.  Now all I need is an eyepatch, cool hair, and to get people to call me Snake and we can complete the trilogy.

      Well, today was Native American Day at college.. I volunteered to help, seeing as I'm an Aggie Ambassador (good grief, what an inbred name) so I get to help out with some of this stuff that goes on around campus.  I spent most of the day running from one side of the stage to the other, up to the lighting booth, back to the stage, out to the Campus Center, back to the Auditorium, back and forth, forth and back.. got a good workout, at least.  Many thanks and words of appreciation in my direction, and all in all, it was a good day.  I really enjoyed meeting some of the motivational guys, even though the stuff they had to say was the same old stuff I've heard since third grade.  I did photos for people, including the Chickasaw Nation, and even though they didn't come out too well (on the digital camera) it's still a far cry better than their photos - seeing as they didn't have a photographer present for the event.  Anyways, I got two t-shirts out of the deal, a nice long sleeve yellow one, and a black one that I haven't looked at yet.  Missed all of my classes today, but.. from what the guys in class were telling me, I didn't miss much.  105 days left in Oklahoma!  Oh, and Windows XP finished - It's too late to install now, so it'll probably be Friday before I can get to it.  Here's hoping Horizons will cooperate with it!

      Still waiting on Windows XP.. hopefully it can finish today or tomorrow, as it's getting pretty close.  I've been working on my homepage again, and bit by bit, it's taking shape.  I'm fairly pleased with the flexibility that CSS is allowing me in arranging elements on my page.  It's fantastic.  I'm expanding it from what I originally intended, though, to include my social and political opinions as well, instead of just a vanity/hobby page.  As soon as I get a decent quantity of content written and made available for reading, I'll start submitting my page to search engines.  As it stands now, though, that may be a while.  I started on my English homework yesterday, and I should probably do my summary today if at all possible.  The first assignment of this semester is an outline and a summary of a persuasive essay.  I'll probably end up posting my compositions from last semester, and this semester on my homepage as well, but.. that will have to come later.  Diamond and I are still working through our differences.  I really don't like all the makeup she's wearing now, even though other people say they like it.  I want to see her face, not the shape of her face with paint all over it.  She's talking about getting an eyebrow piercing, but I've begged her not to.  She's changed so much over the 6+ years we've been married, and while change isn't necessarily a bad thing, I'm really not happy with the direction things are going.  She's come to the conclusion that she doesn't need a husband, but she's tried to reassure me that for some reason she does need me.  I call that a want, not a need, and frankly I'm just at a loss for what to do about it all.  She still loves me, and I still love her, always forever no matter what.. but that doesn't mean I'm going to be supportive or happy about all the alterations she's putting herself through for reasons she says she can't explain.  She does look good, though.. she's lost a lot of weight, and I'm secretly hopeful that she'll lose some more.  She's working out, and I look forward to the day when she tones up some.  I really want to get back into working out, also, but I'm probably going to end up waiting until I'm out of school and we're in a house that can accomodate the height of the fully assembled machine.  I'm doing some strength training in my forearms and wrists, though.  Once we're in a place where we can get into a martial arts school, we want to get into something like kenpo, but I may be leaning away from that and more towards Muai Thai or something more "useful" in terms of real world application.  At least that's the way the guys in alt.martial-arts put it.  I'm also considering kendo, since Al got me that nice katana for Christmas.  I know it's not as high quality as the real hand forged, tempered blades, but it  is  a nice blade, and I would like to get some use out of it.

      Still waiting on Windows XP to finish downloading.  Diamond started it either while we were in Alabama, or immediately upon our return.  Either way, this is taking a LOT longer than I wanted or expected.  I'm tired, but at the same time, excited.  We had our first lecture in Gunshop Management today, and I'm really looking forward to the day when I'll be getting ready to do this for real.  It would be too hazardous for me to attempt immediately out of school, not to mention prohibitively expensive, but that aside, I do believe that 5 or 6 years out of school will be feasable, both within my level of ability, and within reach financially.

      I've all but given up on getting Horizons to work on my system.  It simply will not cooperate.  I'm going to wait until Diamond gets Windows XP downloaded, and I'll give that a try, but if that doesn't work, I'm going to cancel my account.  Tech support has replied to my case TWICE in the month my case has been open - they are refusing to respond, or they are simply unable - either way, it's not worth paying for.  This is a huge disappointment, too.. I mean heart wrenchingly so.. I've waited for more than three years to finally get to play this game, and once I get it, it doesn't work and tech support is absolutely worthless.

      A bit of good news!  Today was the first US History class, and we learned that our final in this class would be held on Wednesday, May 5.  While this in and of itself may seem rather insignificant, the fact that this is my only Friday class means the countdown gets bumped up a notch.  First thing this morning, we had 120 days left in Oklahoma - now, 119.  And considering that Thursday is nothing but Machine Shop II, coupled with the fact that we also have this class Tuesday mornings means that we may actually be bumped back  another  day, to 118 as of right now.  But for the time being, I will refrain from jumping too far ahead - 119 it is.  But we can always hope!

      Well, everyone in class is royally peeved at Patrick.  Patrick was one of last year's Sophomores, and apparently knows the individual we were going to be purchasing our Caspian 1911 frames and slides from.  Patrick for some reason known only to God told this man that we were in fact  not  ordering Caspian frames, that instead we were going to be working with Springfield guns.  So, first day of class, when we're supposed to have our completely bare, bald, unfitted gun parts, what do we have?  Nada!  Nothing!  And it's going to be about 4 weeks before we  do  have anything to work with.  On the other side of the coin, we do have a number of projects due for John, and he told us that if we work hard, we can have them all done in 5 weeks, leaving the rest of the semester to work on special projects or anything we're interested in, so.. maybe things will work out after all.  /crosses fingers  120 days!

      First day of orientation went ok.. kind of nice only having 50-60 people to deal with.  I could have left around 10:00, but I stayed for another hour or so anyways, reading this book Redwall that I got for Christmas.  Good book!  I'm going to have to see about getting the rest of the series now.  I'm not finished with it, only about 1/3 of the way through, but this guy, Brian Jaques (pronounced "jakes") is a good author, no doubt.  Hopefully tomorrow goes as smoothly.  There are all the little mini-seminars for drug use and sex ed, that sort of stuff, so I'll have plenty of reading time, at least.  And then... (ominous silence) my 25 credit hour semester starts Thursday.  I'm not going to do work study this semester.  They limit you to 15 hours anyways, but considering the fact that I have classes on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights, I really don't feel like spending Wednesday and Sunday nights and Friday afternoons at school, too.  Classes are going to be rough enough without that added weight.  122 days!

      The trip home was no biggie, actually a little easier with Washu in the back in her cage, but that's another story for another time (maybe).  I don't know why I haven't posted this info until now, but anyways, I went to JC's and found out - they no longer do gunsmithing work.  Instead they send it all out to this place in Cowen, TN, soooo.. I run back to Dadoo's house, call this guy, and make the two hour trek out to Cowen.  Geez..   Anyways, I get there and speak with the guy, and yeah, he'd consider hiring a seventh employee, and he said that if they didn't get any more work, they'd have enough there to keep them busy through July 4.  So, as it stands now, that's where I'm aiming, but of course I'm going to keep looking.  If I can find work in Huntsville, Madison, Decatur, Athens.. somewhere in there.. I'll of course be going there instead.  But this guy offered me 400$/week, 21k$/year.. very not bad, though not as high as I'd really like.   Considering the trek I had to make to get out to Cowen, though, I think it very feasible for me to work someplace for a few years, build on my knowledge, practice, gain confidence, and finally open a shop in Athens.  I think it's workable, at least I certainly hope so.  In any case, that's what I'm going to work towards.  Spring Orientation starts tomorrow, and they want me there at 7:45am.  Kinda rough, but manageable, I think.  I may try to head out early and get coffee and a doughnut or two, but.. we'll see.  School starts back on Thursday, and I've got 25 credit hours this semester.. really going to be a rough one, but hopefully it will be worth it.  It better be worth it.

      I still have no idea what I want to do my short story on, but hey, I'm home.  We left for Oklahoma City yesterday afternoon for the OSGA Congressional Convention, and all in all, the whole day and a half wasn't too bad.  Got to spend some time with friends.. Joanna and Micah.  We had dinner Friday night at Rose State College, and then we went back to the hotel.  We all sat down and watched TV for a couple hours, got a milkshake from Sonic, watched TV a bit more, chatting and stuff the whole time.  Pretty fun, really.  Today sucked, though.  The congressional convention was disorganized, drawn out, and really not very productive.  We got a new constitution put through, new bilaws, but all the amendments representatives were putting out, questioned, debated, withdrawn, withdrawal recinded, amendments to the amendment, withdrawn again, withdrawal recinded again, and finally voted upon (all of this on one amendment) and in the end it didn't pass...   But.. with only 67 days left in Oklahoma, and since the next convention won't be until this time next year, I'm through with it.  Aside from Higher Education Day in a couple weeks, that is.  Hopefully it won't be such a snafu.  The capital building was pretty nice, though.  Tons and tons of carved marble, paintings, murals, an impressive dome.. nice place.

      Morons on parade...  Geez, I'm watching Jay Leno right now, and they're talking about the conclusion of this edition of "Jaywalking All-stars" and I'm thinking to myself, "How pathetic that these people's 15 minutes of fame is wasted by merely being the  stupidest  people some other famous person could find on the side of the street."  Now that I think about it, what kind of a world do we live in where  stupidity  is rewarded?  Morons.. all of them.  And it's people like this that are bringing down America.  People who aren't paying attention to the big picture and don't care about anything about which liberal presidential candidate will give them the most money, the most healthcare, the most social security, the most welfare.. in short, the most handouts.  And while one hand gives those handouts, the other hand is taking away our rights, our privacy, and our dignity.

I'm not sure how long the URL will be valid, as sites like this sometimes move stuff around unannounced, but anyways, at the time I voted here were the results:     Nationwide for all law-abiding citizens: 52%  Nationwide for all retired peace-officers only: 0%  Up to each state to set regulations: 1%  Universal Vermont style for all: 44%  Banned: 0%     Total votes: 1025    For those interested, I voted Universal Vermont style for all.

      We had a great time last night with Vera and Brian!  They called us up around 5:00 last night and invited us out to dinner.  We had planned on going to a movie in Durant, but it snowed and we didn't want to deal with icy roads on the way home, so we just went to Rick's Red Onion Grill here in town.  Had a great time, we sat and talked for I think about 3 hours, the owner gave us complimentary coffee, a free cake (the valentine's heart cakes they had ordered weren't selling, so she just gave us one) and she gave Vera and Diamond each one of the roses by the door.  It was great!  We've got to do that again sometime.. maybe take them to Simple Simon's or something like that.  Only 80 days left in Oklahoma!  Woo!

      Affirmative Action was started in 1965 by President Lyndon Baines Johnson as a method of overcoming the discrimination that had persisted despite civil rights laws that already existed. The goal was to level the playing field between whites and minorities in terms of college admissions and job offers.  From the very start this was a stupid idea. Instead of simply enforcing the laws that already existed, our wonderful government had to stick its nose into the personal lives of every American citizen by initializing discrimination against white people, and putting minorities into positions that they did not deserve due to their academic and professional demeanor.  I'm not racist, yet I will be accused of such anyways. Regardless, if the blacks and Asians and other minorities in this country can't make it on their own because they don't study, or they do not have the professionalism required to be successful in America's highly competitive marketplace, then they don't make it. For the government or an employer or a college to intentionally take in people based on their skin color as opposed to their level of competence weakens the system.  Giving rides to incompetent people lowers the average level of productivity. In the early days of American history, this was an issue to some extent, because jobs and college placements were given to incompetent white people instead of competent minorities who had applied. Today, businesses and colleges are led by people competent enough to realize that the ability of their individual employees or students is far more valuable than their skin color or place of birth.  Though many college campuses today are not granting spaces specifically to minorities, they are willing to give thousands of dollars in financial aid to those same minorities. Somehow, they've reasoned amongst themselves and come to the conclusion that just because someone belongs to a racial minority, they deserve free money, even though there are white people in just as dire need, if not moreso, than they. Not all white people are rich, and I am living proof of that. I have had an extremely hard time paying for my school, and getting my rent and bills paid, and getting grocieries, et cetera and on, and on, and on.. just because someone's skin color is different from mine does NOT mean they have a harder time finding work, or getting scholarships.  The scholarship and grant organizations that are set up to help a specific race of people just as racist as the KKK. This includes all the American Indian crap floating around here in Oklahoma, this includes every instance of the NAACP, and any other racially oriented organization out there.  If someone were to start an organization that gave grants only to white people, I guarantee there would be riots in the streets over it, accusations of racism, and myriad other problems all over this nation.  Affirmative action, quotas, special monies, and all their ilk should be banned. We're grown ups now, let's act like it.

      I'm working on a series of opinion pages that are already going up on my website  urlLink here .  I'm going to start posting each one here as I get it done, and since I've already got a dozen of them ready to go, I'm going to post one a day for a while until they're all up.  I need to get this page set up to match the rest of my website, but anyways, here's the first one, on abortion.  Enjoy!   When a sperm fertilizes an egg, all the genetic material is present for a human being. It has the potential to grow up to be anything any five year old can be, so long as nobody steps in and cuts off what is needed for his life to continue.  So why is it ok for the unborn child to be killed, but not the born child? It's the exact same concept! Mom (and hopefully Dad) view the coming child as an encroachment upon their lives, so they decide to kill it. They should be prosecuted the same as the Mom who drives her car into the lake, leaving the three encroachments upon her life to drown in the car.  The only reasonable defense to abortion that the Pro-Abortion crowd has come up with is the lame excuse that "it's her body". Bull. It was her body when she and dad were in the bedroom - once the egg is fertilized, the body that is now growing inside of her belongs to someone else, and she does NOT have the right to snuff it out.  As with anything, though, there are exceptions to the rules. I believe abortions to be fair and just when the mother's life is endangered. Call it an emotional decision if you will, but hey, I'd rather my wife be around for another eighteen years than someone who I haven't met yet.  Some will say that rape cases are candidates for abortion, but I do not. It's not the child's fault the father is a criminal, and the child should not receive the death penalty because of what the father did. Yes, rape is a traumatic experience. Yes, it was a violation of "her body" and now she's going to have to go through nine months of pregnancy against her will, but again, it's not the child's fault, and now that the child exists, he deserves every opportunity in life that his five year old counterpart has. We don't give the ok for Mom to kill her children when Dad is a wife beater, do we? It's a violent experience, it's a violation of "her body" isn't it? But it's still no excuse to bring down such harsh punishment on someone who is not at fault.  This argument does depend on the viewing of a fetus as a living human being, which some will dispute for one reason or another, but I look at it this way. If that fetus has the potential to grow up and take a place in society as you and I have and it's ok to kill it anyways, then even though you have the potential to grow old and enjoy retirement, it's ok to kill you too, since you're most likely going to be a burden to those around you when you have to go to the doctor and can't drive yourself home, when you're going to have to go into a nursing home, or live with your children.  But that's not ok, and neither is abortion.

      Aha, a Friday!  I hate people sometimes.  Last night, Thursday night, we had lab time in the machine shop, so I go in to make use of it.  Chad Mercer, leader of the renouned F-Troop, for some reason wanted the mill I was on, and so claimed that he had set his tools there, zeroed the mill and vise, made himself at home, and was going to be using it.  Ok, fine, I'll buy that, his toolbox was about four feet away, the mill was clean, had no setup, and the lab had been open for.. oh.. half an hour, maybe.  I'd had time to get into the welding shop and silver solder a latch button to my ejector box housing, after fiddling with the tanks outside and discovering that the only oxygen cylinder that was hooked up was empty.  Anyways, I do all that, get into the shop, figure out which tools I need, get them from Everett, and start zeroing the mill head, when Chad shows up and tries to claim he'd been there first.  Had the mill head been zeroed, like Chad claimed, I would have backed off and let him have it - but it was off .010" on the Y-axis and .004" on the X.. he lied, thinking that I'd just back down, quiet Kyle that I am.  When I didn't, he knew he'd blown it, and got really mad.  He dripped some kind of blue/rust remover on my newly blued sight bases, receiver, and barrel, and glued a bunch of my stuff to my desk.  I found all of this today.  At least there's only 11 weeks of school left, and then I'll never have to see him again.

      Geez, what is it with me and Wednesdays?  Anyways, the past week has seen little more than more work.  My truck was hit in the school parking lot yesterday.  Whoever it was left a whole lot of white paint on my truck, about a foot long and five inches high, right on the rear wheel well.  I couldn't find the truck today, but I'll keep looking.  Not sure what I'll do when I find them, but I  want  to make them pay for it.  Next week will be mostly a work week for me, as John and Dean are both going to Las Vegas for the Shot Show, Wednesday through the rest of the week.  I'm trying to get as much done in my last 60 days of class as I possibly can, and two and a half full days of work is going to be a big help in that endeavor.  McDowell is threatening me again, yes, over the truck thing, because I'm looking for people with white trucks.  Apparently, he's afraid one of his friends is the one I'm going to nail to the wall.  No, he didn't say that, but it's pretty obvious.  I swear, I wish he would do something to assault me, just to give me a reason to retaliate.  I've carried my baton to school full time since last semester when he was running his mouth, submitted a formal complaint, so if he ever does pull something, I'll have legitimate reason to have been carrying it all this time.  Plus, I'll finally get to use it.  It's probably not healthy for me to actually be  wanting  to get into a fight, but considering I've never been in one, I have this yearning desire to see just what I would do.  I finally got my second outline done for CompII, submitted it, and I'll start work on the essay for it tomorrow night.  Right now, I'm going to finish "The Fifth Element."  Good movie.  If you haven't seen it, go rent it.

       Lock 'n load   I'm test firing my pistol tomorrow!  Safeties all work, everything functions, I just didn't have ammo today.  I'm going to stop by the gun shop in Tish on the way in tomorrow morning and pick up a box to test with.  After this, I'll be fitting the "fun" pieces I bought for my pistol to replace the old junky ones that came with the kit.  The only real problem, I think, is going to be the grip safety, since it's going to involve reshaping the curve on the back of the frame - a task I'm not looking forward too, since Dean won't let us use the jig on our first one.  The frame isn't a cheap part, either - it's the heart of the gun, the piece that holds the serial number, and the only piece the BATF cares about when they define a gun.  I'll have it done in a couple days, hopefully, but I'm going to try to get all the gunk cleaned off tomorrow, get it tested, and bring it home for a picture tomorrow evening before it gets blued and the sights put on and the new grip safety installed.

       Mondays are a mixed bag   I got my 1911 fitted and assembled to the bare minimum today, which is a very good thing.  However, I was going to color case my Savage tonight - Beck said that even though the air compressor wasn't functioning in tip top shape, we could finagle with it and get enough air pressure to aerate the water for quenching.  I start up the oven at 4:30pm, get the receiver and everything into the charcoal, packed, and it's in the oven, everything's fine, temperatures are running fine... skip to 8:15, time to prep for quenching.  We go to turn the air compressor on and....  nothing .  Apparently sometime between this afternoon and this evening, the thing quit completely, so - I got to anneal my receiver - again.  Which isn't totally a loss, I suppose, considering that I forgot to insert the plate into the rear tang to ensure that it doesn't twist too much on quenching.  I'll be bluing tomorrow night with Mike - the last step in my rifle's completion - and hopefully this weekend I'll be able to get out and shoot it.  I've been looking forward to this for a long time now.

       Operation: A-Ok   I've had a counter on my bio page since January 1 of this year, but it wasn't the kind of counter I wanted.  It only kept track of the days until we leave, and obviously not in real-time.  Now, I have found a counter that does exactly what I want, and so I have placed it here and dubbed it all "Operation: A-Ok."  Abandon Oklahoma!  See the bottom right corner for details.

       Tard of the Day   More or less an uneventful day.  There's a guy driving one of the white "Home Health & Hospice" pickups at the laundromat today, and he's got his brat with him.  This guy's a tard for no other reason than letting his brat run all over the place, do whatever he pleases, without correction.  The brat decided it would be funny to barricade the door so his dad couldn't get back inside, nevermind that he's kicking over other people's laundry baskets and almost tripping  me , and the dad says not one word, not one iota to Tard Jr.  The kid is running around the washing machines with the wheeled baskets in the facility for people to use, jumping off the chairs, and then goes outside and picks up rocks out of the parking lot to throw at the building (which has very large windows - easily hit if the kid throws one off course, especially since he's hitting the wall right under the window I'm sitting in front of)   while Tard Sr. watches  !

       So I'm heartless   Spur of the moment idea, but Scooter, Diamond and I went to see "The Passion of the Christ" tonight.  Fun night, really.  We went over to his mom's place for Diamond to work on her costume, and Scooter was pondering what to do on this fine Saturday night, and so suggested we go see Passion.  We're up for it, so we hang around there for about an hour before we head out to feed Washu (who likes Scooter, by the way) and on to Sherman.  Stopped and had Chinese at China Star, bummed around the mall for half an hour or so, and then off to the movies.  Now, I by no stretch of the imagination consider myself one of those touchy-feely emotional types, and so it is no surprise that the movie didn't really "get" me.  There were people crying behind me, there were people crying to my right, Diamond on my left was crying, there were people in front of us crying, but the movie really didn't get to me any more than any other crucifixion movie ever did - and I've seen a bunch of them.  At least five I can think of off the top of my head.  Yeah, I cringed at some of the torture scenes where chunks of flesh are being ripped off his body, where his rib bones are exposed... But on an emotional, spiritual level, I felt nothing.  One guy behind me, who fell asleep and was snoring halfway through the torture scene probably didn't get much out of the movie, either.  I like this feeling.  To be able to sit and watch this movie objectively is, to me, a triumph.  I listened for Greek, but I did not hear any.  Either I am too unfamiliar with the pronunciation of the language, or I am correct and the only instance of Greek in the movie was the sign that was nailed to the cross.  I heard familiar words in Latin and Aramaic, and I appreciated the effort which was put into making the movie in these dead languages.  There was definitely some poetic license taken - the movie was fleshed out from what we see in scripture, but the essence of the story was left unchanged.  You are presented with no more than what you find in scripture - and perhaps that is a contributing factor to my indifference.  In any case, it was a good movie, though I fail to see (and she has yet to explain) why Diamond is still so distraught over the movie.  Scooter liked it, and appreciated the "passion" of the movie.  He doesn't claim to be Christian, and I would have liked to press the issue and witness to him.  It's not like he doesn't know what's involved.. He says that he doesn't want to appear hypocritical, that he understands the belief system, but doesn't live by it.  I don't know details, but here's hoping that I can be of some positive influence before we get out of here.  We're all going to go see "Hellboy" next weekend after the Medfair - a much lighter and less stifling movie.  I'm looking forward to it.

       The marriage issue   Marriage was originally a religious implementation.  It is only in recent times that the government has stuck its fat finger into this pot, going where it shouldn't - as is the case with a  lot  of what the government does, but that's another story for another time.  All the queers demanding the "right" to marry are deluded in thinking that the government truly has the authority to authorize such abominations, and the churches that  do  perform gay marriage ceremonies are way outside what God has set forth - but often people are going to do what they want to do, even while  claiming  to be following God, regardless of what God says.  I say we nullify the issue.  Gays want the right to marry specifically so they get the same tax breaks and benefits as real married couples get - otherwise they could just shack up together (as they do anyways) and live their lives like everyone else.  If we eliminated the government's perceived right to regulate marriage (the tenth amendment clearly states that any powers not clearly allowed to the federal government nor prohibited to the states in the constitution are reserved for the states and the people - this includes marriage, as the Constitution says nothing about marriage) then suddenly we'd see a level playing field in terms of IRS benefits and the like for married couples.  The next step would be taking away the regulation of marriage from every state - marriage is a religious implement, not the government's.  People will complain to my ideas, no doubt, but I don't really care.  They're going to complain because it will mean a loss of tax breaks for married couples.  Frankly, you're addressing the wrong issue.  The issue shouldn't be tax breaks for married couples, it should be reduced taxes for everyone.  The government is overtaxing the population, and it needs to stop, so if that's why you're going to kvetch over the elimination of government interference in marriage, go whine somewhere else, because I really don't want to hear it.  By taking control over marriage, the government has created an issue out of something they have no business in which their candidates can offer to the masses to get votes.  The federal and state governments have no business dealing with marriage - their jobs are to regulate trade, deal in foreign relations, provide for the maintenance of the interior, and maintain the Navy and the Army, when it is formed (Read Article I, Section 8, Clause 12 of the Constitution; the United States does not have the authority to maintain a standing army for more than 2 years at a time).  This will mean that the Justice of the Peace no longer will have the ability to wed a couple - they'll have to go to a church or settle for "common law" marriage. This will mean that every adult person would be treated the same by the government, regardless of marital status or sexual orientation. This will mean that lawyers will be out a big chunk of money they would otherwise get from divorce settlements. This will mean that gays will have to seek out a religious institution willing to bless their union  IF  they want such a blessing - if they want to just shack up, that's their choice.  A church's rejection of their union isn't going to stop them from doing such anyways. This will mean that the strain on the court system to mitigate divorces will drop drastically, and likewise our taxes should drop also...  ... but we'll have to fight for that.

       Oddities and strangeness   Yesterday I didn't feel like doing anything - today, I hardly stopped.  I got my stock painted, the recoil pad attached, the ejector box spring fixed, the trigger guard for my Savage 410 painted and baked, and I got 4 coats of blue onto Jay's 12 gauge that I've had for who knows how long.  It really does look fantastic!  It's not nearly as dark as the caustic bluing, but man, it's got a depth and a sheen to it that hot bluing just lacks.  Each coat took about 2.5 hours, between sitting in the acid fume baths, boiling and carding the parts off.  It really is easy - easier than hot bluing, and actually more enjoyable.  This is something I could do in a home shop, too.  No chemicals to pour down the drain, no elaborate tank setup.. I only needed two tanks - the aquarium for the fuming and a stainless steel pot for the boiling.  Add in the carding wheel and motor and a few little odds and ends and viola - slow rust bluing that'll put any manufacturer to shame.  Tomorrow I'm going in to class early to get it rolling one more time before I go to history class, and depending on how it looks after that, I'll decide whether a sixth exposure is necessary or not.  I'll get pictures posted when it's done.  Next week I'm planning on getting the bluing tanks fired up Tuesday night to get my rifle stuff blued, and I'll be done with it.  If I can get my 410 action color cased Monday night, then I'll be done with everything except the barrel vise and my 1911, which shouldn't take too long considering the progress I've made recently with it.  Anyways, in fueling up today (at the insane cost of 1.63$ per gallon) Some... bizarre amalgamation of teen rock star wannabe and redneck pulled up at the opposite pump.  It's a white truck with the flame dealey coming off the front end and sweeping about halfway up the hood and adjacent sides - It's an indigo flame to start with that shifts to red, orange, yellow, and finally an ugly lime green.  Spiffy paint job and all.. you know the type.  Anyways, the truck gets closer and comes to a stop, and I swear, a short, squat  urlLink Denver Pyle  is driving the thing, blasting country music about how the stuff he loves is what's killing him.  This guy is our Tard of the Day - and yes, one of these days what he loves is going to kill him.  He steps out of his beloved truck without turning off the engine, and proceeds to begin pumping gas into it.  Granted, it's rare, but it can make a really big fireball.

       Tard of the Day   Oh, that it should come to this.. that I might select the daily tard from my limited circle of friends!  Mike's a good guy, loose morals aside, but yeah.. he's a tard.  He failed last semester, so he's eligible for neither the gunsmithing certificate, nor the A.A.S. degree, but he resolved himself prior to the end of last semester and the ensuing Christmas break to return this semester and do his best regardless, to learn what he could, and above all, to finish his 1911 .45 semiauto.  Great - fantastic!  Fast forward to about a month into this semester - he's missing classes, not doing his other required projects which give us practice for the work we'll be doing on our pistol, and when he does show up to class, he drops off his bookbag and immediately takes a "well earned" smoke break.  He wants to finish his pistol, but when you only show up for two hours out of a 13 hour day, and you spend 30 minutes of that time smoking, you're not going to get much done.  Despite my encouraging him to work more, at least on his pistol since that's all he seems to care about now, he seems less and less inclined as the days wind down.

       I don't feel like working   I'm so unmotivated today.. I don't feel like doing anything.  There's a lot of things I  can't  do for a variety of reasons.  I can't paint my stock, as someone else's is sitting in the box at the moment.  I have to wait until it comes out before I can get mine done.  I can't fit my grip safety, because it's not getting spring pressure and I'm kind of at an impass - Dean said to leave the spring alone, as it should be one of the last things we do, but he's not here this week so I can't ask him.  John has a class right now, so I can't ask him about reaming my scope rings.  I don't have anybody else today who has things to blue, so I don't have anybody to start up the tanks with me (though I may have someone tomorrow).  I'm not sure what else I need to get done on my pistol, aside from milling the sight dovetails, which I want to do last, and even if I were ready to do them today, I left all my tool chips at home, so I can't do anything in the shop.  So, I'm in the computer lab next door, typing this and preparing to finish up paper 4.  My outline was accepted, so now all I have to do is convert it into a paper, like 500 words or so.  No biggie, I hope.

       I like my shell   I live in a shell, a sort of membrane, actually, in which I decide what gets in, and what gets out.  My feelings and "inner core" as it has been described are mine, and I prefer for them to stay that way.  I don't like to burden people with my demented problems.  I don't like to be a burden to people - financially, spiritually, emotionally.. anything.  I just don't like it.  I despise it.  I shouldn't have made that little outburst a few days ago in my blog, but what's done is done.  I'm not sorry for it, I just don't think I should have done it.  That said, I assure you that it will not be happening again.  In any case, today I have for you two Tards of the Day - two "local" (north Texas) parents who allowed their 4 year old child to take crack rocks worth about 10,000$ to show and tell at school.  When teachers realized what the kid had,  it wasn't long before police showed up to pay the parents a visit.  I'll post a link as soon as KTEN gets one up on their website.

      Got my recoil pad and sling over Spring Break!  I glassed a couple of dowel rods into my fiberglass stock this morning, and they should be ready for filing and drilling tomorrow morning.  I might be able to get it painted tomorrow also, but I'll just have to wait and see.  Paint, fitting the recoil pad, reaming the scope rings, and rebluing the barrel and action, and I'll be done!  The bottom metal could use another weld job, but I think I'm going to skip it.  I've resolved myself to do a better job on my next one, and maybe come back and fix this one after I've gotten a lot better with the tig welder.  I think I've got my link problem with the 1911 worked out, and depending on what I do with my rifle tomorrow, I may or may not get around to fitting the thumb safety on the .45 - time will tell, I suppose.  The trigger bow on my .22 is rusting up, much to my dismay, so I'm going to have to refinish and reblue it, also.  My 410 break open is, at this very minute, in the oven, probably somewhere around 1000 degrees.  After I disassembled it, we noticed under the thumb latch and down inside the receiver - it had been color cased before!  So I'm having to anneal it so it doesn't crack when I color case it again.  Perhaps I can get that done tomorrow night as well.  Here's hoping.  44 days until I escape this little snot hole, and Diamond wants to stay longer!  Just a couple days,  until some movie comes out.  She wants to go see it on a "baby iMax" movie screen.  Yeah, some movies need to be seen on the big screen, but I don't think any movie is worth staying here any longer than we have to.  It'll be on good screens in Huntsville.

      In the interest of having more real content on my website, as opposed to a whole lot of promising looking links that go to WIP stuff, I'm gutting some of the extraneous garbage out.  Stuff I feel like starting, but once I've gotten into it doesn't seem as fun for me to do.  Some of it will likely return once we have a real house, as opposed to a lean-to with four walls, but until then I think a pruning is in order.  We went to Chinese food at "Taste Island" last night in Durant... on the whole, it wasn't bad, but somebody should teach these people how to make General Tso's Chicken... no heat whatsoever to it, literally.  It was about as spicy as water.  But the rice and sautéed mushrooms were good, at least.  After dinner we went to see "Dawn of the Dead."  Not a bad movie.. not nearly as bad as some of the reviews over at  urlLink IMDb  make it out to be.  Cheesy horror flick with  running  zombies instead of the traditional shambling ones and lots of blood.  I think my favourite part of the movie is where they're picking off zombies from the roof for sport, and they nail Jay Leno.  Who, incidentally, I think I'll name as todays Tard of the Day.  For my reasoning, see  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .

      Tard of the Day: Drunk-driver-defense-lawyer-lady  Couple of years ago I got rear ended by some drunk guy.. nothing serious, really, just a dent here and there, but.. he was drunk, so the cops were called (even though he offered me 200$ to cover the "damages" so we could just go and get out of there), they came out and the guy can't do his ABCs, or walk the line.  Anywho, I end up getting subpoenaed for the prosecution.  Our day in court comes, and this guy's lawyer asks me, and I quote "How fast were you going when you stopped?"  Those exact words.  I explain that I slowed gradually and came to a stop, and that a few seconds passed before he hit me, and she asks me  again  "But how fast were you going when you came to a stop?"  No, I'm not fond of lawyers, especially ones who try to defend some... for lack of a better term... white trash drunk by trying to foist the blame onto somebody else.

      Tard of the Day: Bob!  Ok, I don't really know his name, and he may be a couple of people, but whoever it is, they are stopping the trains near our house so that they block the road for 5, 10, sometimes 20 minutes at a time.  They do this at just about any time during the day.. today for instance, I didn't need to go anywhere, but I saw the train stopped across the road for about 10 minutes or so, blocking cars from going wherever they need to go.  Now, there are two roads nearby that cross the railroad tracks, and there are a number of people that live on the  other  side.  Granted, it's low income housing, as low or lower than ours, but.. the hospital is on  this  side of the tracks, and the people stopping the trains don't really seem to care that this could cause... problems.

      Back in high school, there were cliques of people who would always hang out together, who would always share gossip about friends outside of that clique, who would share idle tidbits about members of that clique when they weren't around.  Stuff like that hurts, as any of you who have been in similar situations can attest to.  I had a  very  small group like that - two other people besides myself - one of them being an ex girlfriend.  When she one day decided that I was no longer even worth saying hello to as we passed in the hallways at school, it hurt.  A lot.  I went through another year of high school, and the issue was never resolved - I never found out exactly why she hated me so much.  A month ago, I was part of a new clique, a larger one.. one comprised primarily of family and close family friends I'd left behind in Alabama.  Today, I'm not so sure anymore.  Normally I do not post family dealings on this blog for a variety of reasons which are my own, but today I have decided to make an exception.  Perhaps out of a need to get this stuff down on "paper" or perhaps out of retaliation - I don't really know, nor am I particularly concerned with it at this moment.  About a month ago, Diamond and I were having marital problems.  She's not happy, she wishes she hadn't gotten married ("so soon"), she's not "in love" with me anymore, she's afraid to tell me things like this anymore for fear that I'll get mad at her... stuff that's driving me up the wall.  I've asked her what she wants of me, and all I ever get is "I don't know."  I try.. I've calmed down a lot since we first got married, and I don't get as loud as I used to, I don't stay mad as long as I used to.  I try to give her everything she wants from me, but I can only do that  when  I know she wants something.  I'm not psychic.  We met on the internet, so communication played a big part early in our relationship, and now it seems we don't talk that much anymore.  Granted, we don't have nearly the volume of topics as we used to, because we're familiar with each other now, but that's beside the point.  She wants me to change to suit her needs, her wants, her desires, and I've put forth effort to do that.  She has changed a lot since we got married, too, though.  She's now into makeup all the time, baby bat goth wannabe stuff, going out with friends and not even asking if I want to come, not caring what I'll have to do for the night while she's out having fun.  But a lot of this has changed.  She doesn't wear makeup as much anymore (a good thing), she  seems  a lot happier, or at least pleasantly content, and she's asked me if I want to go out with her and a coworker tomorrow night.  Call me a mistrusting fool, but I don't buy it.  So I ask her why I'm being invited, and she says she doesn't know.  I ask whether or not she wants me to come, and oh so nonchalantly replies "I'm indifferent, I don't care."  Upon chatting a bit more, she says that she doesn't think I would be "comfortable" around her friends, and though unspoken, around  her  when she's around her friends.  She and I have different interests now, she says, and going to Chinese food and a cheesy horror flicks just aren't in my comfort zone, apparently.  I still don't know whether I'm going to go or not, but...  She was wearing makeup today, and I pointed to it and asked "What's this?" in a playful tone, a smile on my face, totally innocent and she knows it.  She replies that I'm not around her at work while she's wearing it, so it doesn't matter.  All of this taken together implies that even if she's doing something I don't like, or something I'm uncomfortable with, so long as I'm not there it doesn't matter.  So I state that what I do while she's not around doesn't matter either, and suddenly she's on the defensive, asking me what I'm doing, what am I talking about?  Some tension, end of conversation, she goes to finish email and I start working on this.  Remember those problems we were having about a month ago?  Her father was made privy to the problems, either through her blog, or in a private email, or phone conversation.. I don't know.  Anyways, considering the fact that I  don't  put stuff like this up in my blog, and considering that I  didn't  have any conversations with him or his wife, or anybody else for that matter, I'm fairly certain he had no idea of my take on the situation.  So what does he do?  He emails me and starts attacking me for mistreating his daughter, for not treating her like some empress, kneeling and bowing and submitting to her every want and whim.  It becomes blatently obvious very quickly that he doesn't really care about me, or our marriage.. he cares about his daughter and her wants, and whether she is right or wrong is secondary.  I decide it best to just ignore him for the time being, and about 2 days later, I tell Diamond about his email.  A couple days later, I find out that she has taken it upon herself to email him and suggest that his course of action was probably not in the best interest of the parties involved.  Sure, that's nice.. anyways.  In going through the blogs of my "friends" I've noticed something that was present, that is now absent.  A small thing, really, insignificant to you, my reader (regardless of who you are) but a link to my blog and website no longer exists upon their pages.  Her father has not emailed me to provoke sane, mature discussion on the matter.. he has not emailed to apologize, he has not emailed to see how I am doing.. his wife is following suit.  Regardless of what follows after I hit the Post & Publish button, I can no longer trust them, and I don't know if I can trust my wife.  I'm being ejected from the clique once again because having offended one member, the rest are siding with her without even caring where I stand, how I feel, or what I think.  People who I thought were my friends and family abide by these terms of endearment no longer.. they are the in-laws, and the in-laws' friends.  I've put forth my effort, I've tried, and it's not good enough.  So be it.  I know this post will get back to them sometime, but I really don't think it matters.  Either they're going to stop and offer some half-hearted apology or they're going to continue on without blinking.  I expect the former, given who they are, but I also expect it to be some worthless apology, the likes of which one would receive after a spoiled little brat (much like one of the urchins from "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory") is corrected by a parent who cares more about appearance in public as opposed to raising a good and well behaved child.  You know the kind.. the kid who says to his mother's friend  after being commanded , "Sorry I broke your ugly little yard gnome."  Do me a favour, though, eh?  When it does get back to you, don't bother linking to my blog... that kind of instant attempt-to-appease is utterly meaningless, perhaps even insulting, after I've called you on it.

      Sitting down tonight, a lot on my mind.  It's St. Patrick's Day, and also the tenth anniversiarry of my dad's death.  Seven weeks from today, from this minute if I have any say in it, we'll be on the road back east.  It's a good day, overall.  It's pretty outside, a nice breeze blowing which makes me wish I had a kite to fly.  There's a wonderful field out behind our place that's owned by the peanut factory, but which they hardly ever use.  It's overflow parking for semi trucks, and about the size of a soccer field.  No powerlines, no trees... perfect.  We fixed chili for dinner, and I went out and got a six of Guinness Extra Stout.  Dark, dark stuff, but it's good.  It's only the second pack of alcohol we've gotten since we moved out here; I'm by no means a real drinker, but it's good on occasion.  I'd like to be able to afford it more often.. maybe two or three times a year instead of just one, but for the time I'll take what I can get.  I went poking around the net today after reading more of the Tard Blog, and discovered that the blog, much to my dismay, is defunct.  The page I linked to, and which I've been reading, is only an archive copy.  Nevertheless, I like the idea so much I think I'd like to start keeping track of a "Tard of the Day" award.  Something I would like to retain as a standing memorial to everyone out there, teacher and non-teacher alike, who has to put up with tards on a daily basis.  That said, Diamond encouraged me to put up Washu as the first recipient of the Tard of the Day award, but I think I'm going to reserve this for humans only.  So, without further ado, I present to you the first ever Digital Abyss Tard of the Day:  urlLink Michael Moore.

      Put up my review of  urlLink Aliens vs. Predator 2  last night.  It's not complete, as there's a lot of material in the game I haven't gotten to, but I've wanted to get something like this going for a while now, I just haven't.  I'm probably going to have to put the fun creativity on hold for a while, since I've still got five papers due in English before the end of the semester, which is only seven weeks away.  My goal is to get two papers done this week while I'm on break, and then try to get a paper each week starting next Wednesday.  The last day of school is actually a Wednesday.. May 5, exactly seven weeks from today.  49 days.  Anyways, I need to go order sling swivels and my sling; when I tried to order them last time, they were out of stock with the slings, so I told them just to forget the swivels, I'll order them when I order the sling.  The lady tried to sell me the swivels anyways, even though they won't do me any good until the sling itself gets here... go figure.  Oh, and I've got a link to a new blog a friend informed me of - The Tard Blog - check it out if you haven't already.  No, it's not politically correct, and that's one of the things I love about it.

      A few months ago, while walking Washu out in the backyard, I had the onset of a feeling like one might experience standing outside one's hotel room.  It was at that point that I began to view the past two years as an extended though rather unpleasant hotel stay.  Tonight, just a few minutes ago, actually, it actually  smelled  like a hotelish (hellish?) neighborhood.  The machinations over at the peanut factory didn't help matters, I'm sure, but it's all helping to whittle away the time remaining; 52 days and counting.  Almost hard to believe it's just a week past the halfway point.  Only seven more Sundays remaining.  It's about time to start evac planning, methinks.

      No, I did not take this test until I received a result I liked.  Besides, I like the classic European dragon better than the Chinese.      You are Form 5,  Dragon : The Weaver.   "And The Dragon seperated the virtuous from the sinful.  He tore his eyes from his sockets and used them to peer into the souls of those on trial to make a judgement.  He knew that with endless knowledge came endless responsibility."   Some examples of the Dragon Form are Athena (Greek), St. Peter (Christian), and Surya (Indian).  The Dragon is associated with the concept of intelligence, the number 5, and the element of wood.  His sign is the crescent moon.  As a member of Form 5, you are an intelligent and wise individual.  You weigh options by looking at how logical they are and you know that while there may not always be a right or wrong choice, there is always a logical one.  People may say you are too indecisive, but it's only because you want to do what's right.  Dragons are the best friends to have because they're willing to learn.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Upon finishing dinner tonight, I found myself wanting a cookie, so naturally I obtained from my cupboard the king of cookies, the Girl Scouts' Samoa cookie.  Now, this cookie is unique in a number of ways, but foremost is the fact that coconut usually makes my throat tingle and itch, and thus I avoid it at all costs.  But way back when I was learning stuff like this about myself, around eight years old, I didn't realize the little crumblies atop this dessert were coconut, because they don't taste like coconut and they didn't make my throat hurt.  Call it a mental thing if you wish, but even other dishes in which I was unaware, should they have contained coconut I would quickly be alerted to its presence.  In any case, we have a couple boxes of Samoas for this year, and it has been a real treat, because a few years ago, I stopped seeing "Samoas" and instead, upon receipt of my order, I have been plagued with "Caramel Delites."  They look alike, they smell alike, and they even come in  similar  purple boxes, but I assure you, faithful reader, the substitution is known.  The less creative moniker is indicative of an inferior product, as I truly can discern a difference between the Samoa and the Caramel Delite.  Today, I learned why.  Apparently, there are two companies which manufacture cookies for the Girl Scouts, and apparently one is in the business of offering up this substandard treat to the masses, oblivious or at the least unconcerned that we of the rank and file are slowly becoming educated to their wiles and that we will not stand for it.  If you, like me, are disappointed in the status of the Caramel Delite of cookiedom, make it known to your local deale-- eh.. supplier that you wish for Samoas, and not the mediocre replacement now prevalent among the scouts.  Together, we shall overcome!

      Went out to the park with Washu this afternoon while Diamond took a  very short  nap.  We had sat down to watch "The Order" and she had laid down, her head in my lap, and got too comfy it seems.  She didn't seem too terribly interested in watching it again to catch what she had missed, and I can't really blame her.  It's not as good of a movie as I expected.  Anyways, after it was over, I needed to take the movie back, get a can of Broccoli and Cheese soup for dinner tonight, and to take the movie back, so I decided to take Washu out with me.  It'd been a while since Ariel had the house without her for a little while, and it'd been a while since she'd been allowed to go and play somewhere other than the backyard, so I took her along with me.  She was wonderfully well behaved for the whole trip, laying down on command when I had to get out of the truck, instead of trying to barrel past me to get out like she usually does.  There was nobody at the park, so after I walked around with her for about 10 minutes, I let her run off the leash for another 10 or 15 minutes.  She loved it.. she had to sniff everything.. every tree, every table, every tuft of grass, you name it, her nose found it... but she loved it.  Tail wagging the whole time, running, playing, chasing leaves in the breeze.  When I thought it time to go, I only had to call her to me once, from about 50 or 60 yards away, no less, and she came immediately to me.  It's only when she's really excited that she doesn't listen, and it's at those times that Ariel can't stand her, and admittedly, she gets on my nerves then, too, but she's only a puppy, about 14 months old now.  In a year or two, she'll have calmed down considerably and will be better behaved, but she's really doing well as it is right now.

      Wow!  We went to see the Salzburg Marionettes tonight at Murray.  I had thought it was last Thursday, but no...  anyways, wow!  They have been around for 90 someodd years, and they're out of Austria, with only six weeks of United States tours, and we were fortunate enough to get one night of them at the MSC Fletcher Auditorium.  They presented "The Magic Flute" by Mozart, and it was an outstanding performance.  Being an opera, most of it was singing and all of the singing was in German so it was difficult to follow at times, but overall it made sense to Diamond and me.  The sets were unbelievably detailed and even though I know they only had about 10-15 feet to work with, the depth and perspective of the sets gave the illusion of 40-50 feet in the foreground, and a limitless background.  Mountains, deep forests, caverns, and the expanse of a star cluttered sky were all wonderfully portrayed.  The puppets were wonderfully articulated and skillfully danced, run, walked, flown... you name it.  They picked up props, ran away from bursts of flame, played the flute.. I really can't describe it all in the way it should be seen.  If you ever, ever have the opportunity to see them, I heartily encourage you to do so.  Tickets can run as much as 50$ per person, but I assure you, it is worth the cost, assuming you have some inkling of culture woven into your being.  Now, with that out of the way, I must relay to you, my reader, the absolute torment wrought upon me by the couple immediately to our left during the show.  Five little girls and one little boy, loud, talking, crying, arguing over who gets to use the binoculars (even though we were only on the fifth row from the front of the stage), fighting about who gets to sit in mommy's lap, and the parents didn't try to calm them down or correct them, for the most part.  Once or twice they managed a "shhhh" but overall, the children were very poorly behaved and the parents were indifferent.  It annoyed me, and at times people in the back of the auditorium could be heard shushing loudly, apparently for these little demons beside us.    These presentations serve as Humanities credits for students who require them for their diploma.  Now, we are in Oklahoma, mind you, and thus very few individuals here actually have any culture to them.  At the end of various scenes the cods in the back would whistle loudly and whoop and holler.  The word "infidel" was invented for people like these.  I did enjoy the presentation, though, and if given the chance in the future, I will enjoy seeing them again.

      In any case, I returned home from the Higher Education Day at the Capitol only an hour ago.  Mostly the trip was boring political garbage, with representatives, senators, and even the governor Brad Henry basically doing a "look what we can do" dance for everyone.  More later.. Diamond just got home.  ... well, instead of adding a fourth post to this day, I'll just update this one.  Anyways, I spent the trip up and back mostly reading, but also a good deal of time I spent talking with Brandy.  She's a business major, whom I have prior to this day regarded as somewhat of a wild spirit.  Alcohol, multiple partners, a child... rather messed up, in my opinion.  However, in chatting with her, I find her to be considerably more level headed and mature when put into a serious situation.  Perhaps she just relaxes to a greater degree than most people I am accustomed to; I am not entirely certain.  In any case, she is a much more mature and sensible individual than my first impressions led me to believe.  It's a shame I'm only finding this out now, with 57 days left.  Oh well.  I suppose it's not that large a loss, considering the friends I'm trying to return to in May.

      By "environmentalists" I'm referring to any group of tree hugging hippie freaks out there, be they conjoined under a singular banner such as PETA or GreenPeace.. whatever.  Let's start with PETA, just for grins and giggles.  PETA has been around since 1980, and basically wants all human beings to stop using animals for.. everything. Not for clothing, leather, food, research, pets, entertainment.. nothing. Which is all fine and dandy.. they can treat animals this way if they want to, but, let's look at a couple things, shall we?  Humans are omnivores - we eat both animals and plants. The design of our teeth proves this, the design of our digestive system proves this, and the fact that our eyes face forward show that we are a predatory species. If you look at it from the religious point of view, God intended us to eat meat - he designed us this way, and we have numerous examples from scripture showing that yes, meat is good for you. If you look at it from the evolutionist point of view, we were intended to eat meat - we have all the facilities to do so.  In light of this simple evidence, one wonders how a bunch of lying morons from PETA could hope to garner support with ludicrous ads telling us that it is a mortal sin to eat meat, that eating meat will make men impotent, that meat is the cause of acne, that meat makes our children sick, and numerous other attempts to scare us or guilt us into abandoning meat from our diet. These claims of theirs are totally unfounded, totally ludicrous, and nothing but deceitful lies - how can they expect to get ANY support except from retarded people who don't know any better when the only way they can further their cause is by lying to their audience? PETA rides the short bus.  Militant vegans are just as bad, and I swear, any one of you that attacks me for wearing a leather coat, entering a restaraunt that serves meat, or even looks at me wrong for picking up a box of hamburger helper at the grocery store, you're in for a world of hurt. No, I will not go into specifics about how I'm going to break your arm when you reach for me, but suffice to say, if you want to be vegan, go for it. Try to force it on me, and you'll regret it - I promise.  Greenpeace is pretty much the same as PETA.. full of lies and deceit, a bunch of inbred, extra chromosome, tree hugging morons. For crying out loud, anybody who tries to tell us that Sauron, from the Lord of the Rings, is a metaphor for President George W. Bush deserves to be put in a white room with a straight jacket and given nearly lethal doses of Prozac for the rest of their life. These militant wackos are a threat to Americans, and I consider them to be about on par with the Al Queda. Go ahead, laugh.  Greenpeace members have sabotaged fishing vessels resulting in the deaths of sailors and fishermen, they have illegally trespassed on private property to vandalize and steal equipment, disrupt research that benefits mankind, blatently and maliciously violated international maritime laws. They are guilty of arson fires which have resulted in the losses of millions of dollars to businesses, hundreds of thousands of dollars to private homes under construction, and the deaths of countless innocents. Greenpeace, the ELF, or Earth Liberation Front, Earth First! and other related groups are illegally laundering money to support their illegal actions, the exact same way terrorist organizations all over the world are operating. PETA, mentioned above, has also been cited by the IRS for funnelling illegal money to Greenpeace. Greenpeace members have committed acts of war against the United States military, blockading a US Naval base, they have invaded and commandeered the control room for a nuclar power plant in England, attacked the Exxon Mobile headquarters in Texas, and attempted to kill participants in the 2003 American Cup, a sailboating competition, by ramming their vessels. In 1992, the Animal Liberation Front firebombed a Michigan State laboratory. These sorts of terrorist acts should not and thankfully are not being tolerated. If you happen to be a member of one of these groups, and you come after me, remember - I live in America, I have a concealed carry weapons permit, and you have a history of murder and violence behind you. When they come to scrape up your corpse, trust me, I don't think I'm going to have that much to worry about.

      Well crap.  I just had a nice little rant typed up, but when I hit Post, my modem disconnected and I lost it all.  Anyways, here's my best attempt to reconstruct that which is essentially lost forever.  Sigh.  Jay Leno is a moron.  In the past month, this fat headed moron has made at least fifty attempts at lame jokes, saying that Bush's presidency is illegitimate because Gore received the popular vote.  Now, I knew how the Electoral College worked when it was explained to me in the  seventh grade .  Yeah, you heard it right, folks.. thirteen year olds know more about the federal government than Jay Leno.  Not that this should surprise me.. after all, what else should we expect from a man who gets his jollies from finding the stupidest, most ignorant individuals in the world (all of which apparently live in California, big surprise there) in a little segment cleverly named "Jaywalking".  Yeah, Jay.. you're a great man for knowing the words to the Pledge of Allegiance when some goth high school dropout  wannabe  doesn't know them.  Congratulations.  I guess the moral of the story today, kids, is whatever you do, wherever you go for information,  don't  go to Hollywood.  Remember, if television rots your brain, then the people behind the entertainment industry must have pretty thick skulls to maintain a round head despite the huge vacuous space between their ears.

       Going through the motions   I pulled my tools out of the classroom today after I blued my .45 this morning.  The class is now almost empty, except for Matt and Jamin's stuff, and I don't know why theirs is still present - Gardner called everything off this past Tuesday, and Dean had to pull a few strings to get me in to blue this morning.  I'm going to let it cure for a day or two before I reassemble it and post finished pictures.  Diamond and I are still working things out.  Still a whole lot of stuff going on in both our heads, and there are things which are obviously bothering her, but she won't talk to me about it.  I don't know what to do, she doesn't know what to do, and so every day is a new struggle to keep my head above water.  I try, but she's in a situation where she's essentially been trained to distrust me.  Only God and I know my motives and intentions, and I feel like the boy who cried wolf.  Now that I really am doing my job as a husband, she's unwilling to believe me.  I can't blame her, but at the same time I'm frustrated out of my mind.  She's my life, she's my everything, and I still feel like I'm losing her.  Anyways, it's almost tomorrow - time to start this all over again.

       The truth of liberty   "All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any." 1 Corinthians 6:12  Diamond and I have come to a realization of liberty in our faith, not only in what is allowed, but what is actually morally acceptable.  What this liberty may be is not what is important, but let us use alcohol as a prime example.  So many people have grown up in churches over the past two centuries being taught that alcohol in and of itself is the Devil's brew, that it is evil, and must be wholly avoided at all costs - but scripture teaches contrary to this.  When one from these churches finally stumbles across the Bible's true teachings concerning alcohol and sobriety, they have discovered a liberty which was previously withheld from them due to the teachings of man standing in opposition to the teachings of God.  "But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumbling block to them that are weak." 1 Corinthians 8:9  Even though the freedom to drink alcohol has been discovered, though, one must be careful of his use of this liberty.  If the liberty of one Christian will cause problems for another Christian, then the freeman must squelch his liberty, at least for a time, until his brothers in bondage can see the liberty which God has given us.  "For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another." Galatians 5:13  Even though a freedom has been discovered, it must not be used for selfish reasons.  It must be used to the glory of God.  While I think the glorification of God can be accomplished with all of our freedoms, any ground that must be covered must be done so with extreme caution for the above reasons.  Marriage is a freedom to be used for the glory of God, and it is a freedom which neither of us has used for such a purpose in a very long time.  Our liberty is no longer merely something to suit our own selfish desires.  "And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:" Galatians 2:4  There are people everywhere who come in and try to take away liberty.  Churches who ban the use of instrumental music, confining the praise of God to a cappella worship.  Churches who ban men from holding office as a deacon if his first wife died.  Churches who do not accept men who come in with long hair, tattoos, and leather chaps.  This is not liberty, people, this is bondage, and it is not from God.  It is from men who come in with the intent of bringing us again into bondage.  Often times they think they are attempting to conform to God's will, but read your Bibles - it is not God's will!

       R - E - S - P - E - C - T   I'm realizing that in my marriage I have for too long thought "Why should I?" instead of "Why shouldn't I?"  Why should I listen to more of Diamond's music?  Sure, I like a couple of the ones she's played, but I've also thought a few of them are too weird and lack melody.  "I don't want to like music from people who also make weird, nonmusical stuff like that" has been a driving force behind my constant derision of her favourite artists.    Why shouldn't I give these artists more of a chance?  Music is important to Diamond, and I am learning that opening up to new things is  not  a bad thing.  I'm enjoying a lot of the brand new things I've come to discover over the past week.    Why should I make a big deal about her birthday?  She's turning 25, she's grown up, we're tight on cash, and birthdays weren't that big a deal to me, and I turned out okay (or so I thought.. hmm... ).  Big whoop.. another day, another year.  No one ever  feels  a year older than they did the day before, and too much ruckus about it is totally pointless.    Why shouldn't I make a big deal about her birthday?  It's fun, it's one of those rare occasions where you can have a party with lots of friends and have a blast.  We can't do it every week, but maybe the rarity is what makes it special.  Most of her friends are my friends, too, and I enjoy being around them.  We both enjoy that look in her dad's face on Christmas morning, but come to think of it,  I've never inspired that kind of ecstatic joy on her birthday, or Christmas for that matter.     Why should I stick around Oklahoma after I finish classes just so she can drag out the "goodbye" process?  Sure, I have friends here, but that's no reason to cause delays in plans we've had for two years now.  It's not a "can't move now" issue, it's a "don't want to move now" issue, and a rather illogical one at that.    Why shouldn't we stick around Oklahoma for a little while after graduation?  We don't have enough money to move back now anyways, and my getting a job could alleviate some of the tension between Diamond and I as well as bring in some extra moving money.  She's under a lot of stress right now, and moving would only bring more stress to the situation.    These are the biggies on my mind right now - there are others, and I'll toss them into a new post as I think of them, or am made aware of them.

       The feces hits the fan   Dean has been rather unpleasant for the past few weeks leading me to fear that I may have a problem when it comes time to graduate.  Yesterday afternoon, I found out  why .  Over the past two years, the room has divided itself into two primary cliques - the front and the back.  While there are individuals in both groups who can communicate peacefully and freely with either side, there always has been definite animosity between Jeff and  the rest of the class .  Some of us can tolerate him in small doses, but most of the back of the class hates him, and the feeling is indeed mutual.  They've glassed his vice together, they've made racist jokes around him (he's Jewish), they've insulted his personality and his character, they've mocked him in his attempts at humor, civility, and in his anger.  Well, Jeff finally snapped and has apparently been complaining to Dean, John, and.. oh..  all  of administration for a while now.  When administration finally took the time to address the situation and called on the people Jeff had complained about, they then went and complained about Jeff to administration.  The whole situation had been snowballing for the past two years, but only in the past week has it reached critical mass.  Dr. Pederson, president of the college, spent two days chatting with students, finding out our thoughts, following us around and watching us in lab and lecture.  Crap was still being flung by the chimps, and Jeff caught a facefull and finally said the words... if administration wasn't going to do anything about all the problems, he was going to start shooting.  Apparently these words only reached adminstration through the rumor mill, but apparently enough people corroborated the story that Pederson finally came to the unsavory decision that he couldn't handle this problem, and the sophomore class of 2004 has been disbanded.  We have no gunsmithing finals, we have no more projects due, we have no more technical classes - it's over, ciao, see yas, "you have thirty seconds to disperse."  Those of us who still need lab time are being allowed into the shop in small groups, but it's not for a grade anymore.  They're giving us our grades and our diplomas and washing their hands of the matter.  It sucks, but.. my two years of Gunsmithing school have come to a close.  I am glad to see it, but I despise the circumstances.  This has been my race, and I'm not being allowed to finish it.  The last leg, and the race has been called, and I won without ever crossing the finish line.  Victory is bittersweet.

       Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned   Why have I intentionally rejected things she's been interested in?  Looking back now, I know I did it, but I honestly can not fathom the  reason  behind my doing so.  Her music I have mocked and ridiculed, and I have only listened to three or four of Robyn Hitchcock's songs - I've claimed to not like him at all, yet I haven't really listened to him.  Her costume that she's working on I dismissed off the cuff because I thought it sounded childish, yet there I am at the MedFaire in full costume.  I can't think of all the other things I've dismissed in like manner, but in thinking about them now, I can't believe I've been so repressive towards her interests and outlets.  I haven't listened to her advice, even though it is often sound advice, because **I** wanted to be the one who was right, the one who had all the best advice, the one who knew what they were doing at all times.. the one, and it sticks in my throat to say this, but to be the one in control.  Not over her, specifically, but over the household.  I look back, and in talking with her, I think it was a misinterpretation of the "head of the household" passages from scripture.  I'm not certain - it's something I'm going to have to go back and look at.  Often at the time things were said in the past, I did not realize that it was a control issue for me, and it was not such all the time, but in sitting here thinking about it, I can think of a few examples where I blatently ignored her advice because it wasn't what **I** wanted to do.  I listened to her advice today, about doing my English homework in the library since I seem to have had such a large problem actually getting work done here at home, and what do you know, I finish up  half the writing  in an hour.  It's taken me three days here at the house to get the first half done, but removed from distractions it took me only an hour to finish.  Suck it up, +Kyle, she  is  right sometimes.  That said, I have a few other confessions to make.  I coerced her into having sex with me before she was ready.  When we would get into arguments, I would manipulate myself into a position of superiority  just so I could feel good about forgiving her .  When I would have a bad day, I would take out my frustration and anger on her in the most horrendous ways; if she remembered something incorrectly, an item being on a different shelf than what she told me, I would start an argument with her for no reason, accuse her of trying to hide it from me.. any number of things.  I don't know why I did these things, but, I used to do them.  When we first moved to Oklahoma, she was very, very late with her period, and she feared that she was pregnant.  Instead of acknowledging that we might not have been as careful as we thought, I immediately assumed she had been unfaithful.  I don't know why I did a lot of the things I did, but it's been a long time since I've done many of these things.  I still fight with my problems, trying to force them down, but I am not always successful in this.  Aside from prayer and a swift kick when it's needed, I'm not sure what there is that anyone can do to help me in my self improvement, but please realize, I am working very hard towards this goal.

       Too much to tell   There's really too much that has gone on in the past few days to tell it all, especially in one setting, and especially since I'm only taking a break from writing my English research paper at the moment.  Suffice to say that I have learned a great deal about myself in the past 72 hours, and a great deal about my Diamond in the past 6 days.  I'm still assimilating information, formulating conclusions, and establishing a new heading for my life, my marriage, and my general personality in general.  It's been 9 years since I received my first computer and first ventured onto the internet, and it's been 8 years since I met Diamond in that chat room.  At that time, I was beginning to get into theological debates online, where I could easily reference material and type my response, as I am doing now, much more eloquently and soundly than I can possibly accomplish in a face to face discussion.  I began to learn that people's feelings dictated what they were willing to accept, how they reacted to certain confrontations, and how much control emotion had over what might otherwise be a rational and relatively honest individual.  I think it has only ended approximately a year ago, as I have grown weary of discussing these matters with people who will not listen to fact and logical reason.  Eight years of trying to escape the drudge of emotional responses, of trying to cut emotion out of my interaction with people so that I could try and force reason into unreasonable minds.  Needless to say, I have failed in that endeavor in a most spectacular way.  I have cut emotion out of my life nearly completely, and I no longer give my wife the emotional response and support she needs sometimes.  I have stonewalled her to my own peril and punishment.  I am working to correct this problem, and though the emotional side of things may take some time for me to build up again, there is still the matter of having the patience and fortitude to let Diamond work out in her heart that I am trying to change.  She knows this in her mind, but after 6+ years of my failures, even though I am willing to change overnight, I still have a lot of work to do, and she has to learn to trust me all over again.  Then there are my sins against her, which I will not be going into in this post - though I have decided that I  must  confess them to someone other than her.  I've come to realize that only confessing your sins and asking forgiveness from the person you have wronged makes it so much easier to relapse into that sin, because without your friends and family knowing what is going on, then they don't know when to give you that nudge which you probably need as you repent.  It's easier to keep secrets when fewer people know about them, it's harder to relapse into sin when more people know about them.  I feel like confessing my sins to you will be another step towards earning her trust once more.  I do not think that posting them, letting everyone, namely my family and friends back in Alabama, read those confessions will be a magic pill that will fix everything between us and mold me into the perfect husband for her; it is merely a step.  Yesterday was a day of atonement, so to speak, in which Diamond finally found it in her to forgive me.  I do not blame her for holding on to these things for so long, but suffice to say that in her ability to forgive, a significant gap between us has been closed.  The rest is up to me.  School is going well, as I have at the moment only 9.5 workdays left, and I yet have a number of projects to complete.  Part of my job in closing the gap is to complete school, as the fact that we moved here has, in and of itself, fostered resentment and regret, and if the past two years come to bear no fruit, then the efforts and sacrifices which Diamond has made for me will have been completely worthless.  That said, I'm going back to work on my English paper now.  I may post again when I take another break.  We'll see.

       Greater Expectations   She leaves me two days ago, and now she expects me to be able to do  everything  by myself.  I've learned to rely on her for certain things over the past six years, and suddenly if she's not willing to help me out anymore I'm a horrible person for failing at one of these tasks.  I can not hold this weight.  Something is going to give.

       Bullet time   She's back, for now.  Everyone keeps saying that for the time being, we have to get through this day by day, one day at a time.  When I'm under a deadline to get all of my work done within two weeks, three weeks from today being my last day of class, the situation I'm in now is an absolute hell.  I want to talk, to get everything out on the table, to resolve every question I have in my head, even if the answer is just that my Diamond is being finicky and things aren't even making sense to her.  At least I'll know that I'm not the only one walking around in a totally confused stupor.  Instead, we're only chatting for five to ten minutes at a time before she becomes fed up with either my questions or my insecurity.  Maybe it's just her computer that's bothering her.. it hasn't worked since she pulled it out of the storage building where she put all of the stuff she took "to make a point."  The point?  She's for real.  Shyeah, she leaves me, she won't talk to me, she tells me with the most deadpan expression that she doesn't want to be my wife anymore, and she doesn't care to try to work this out.  I know she's serious, she doesn't have to clean out her stuff to prove that.  And here's the kicker.. she only in the past two days has actually told me with any level of specificity the problems she's having with me.  Finally, I have a goal.  Finally, I have something to shoot for.  And it's practically too late.  It's not fair.  I'm looking to May 5 as a milestone, the end of school, the beginning of my gunsmithing career, even though it won't be with Ray Judge as I had been hoping since the first of the year.  The "one day at a time"  rhetoric  I'm trying to wade through is making every minute stretch out and feel like an hour.  I've become hypersensitive and acutely aware of every time she separates her belongings from mine, every time she refuses to say "I love you, too" to my "I love you", every time she refuses to call me "hon" like she used to, or wink or make kissing noises at me like we did affectionately only three days ago.  She doesn't want to hug me, she doesn't want me to hug her.. she has completely cut me off from all affection whatsoever.  It's like depriving someone of air.  She has told me in the past that she still loves me, but she's not  in  love with me... this total disregard for my feelings in this time where my life, the very fabric of my being, is being torn to shreds, is indicative to me that she doesn't have any feelings for me whatsoever anymore, and doesn't care what this is doing to me.  I talked to Maalac twice in the past day, and he's trying to encourage me that my Diamond does have some latent desire to make this work, that she does still love me, otherwise she wouldn't be home tonight.  I mentioned this to her, and she laughed in my face, told me not to get my hopes up, and made it very painfully obvious that she's only going through the motions.  She promised to be with me, at the very least, through the end of school.  To see out what we came to Oklahoma for.  She doesn't realize or doesn't care that the most basic, primary reason I ever suggested that we come out here is to give me a skill in a job that I love, that can create an environment where I can provide for  my family  as I promised I would when we were married.  If she leaves me at the end of school, the past two years will have been more of a waste of my time, effort, and money than my time at Virginia College.  To top it all off, I find out today that my "friend" VJ is the one responsible for taking my Diamond away from me last night.  She's the one who agreed to come out and help Diamond make her "point" by making half of her stuff disappear, leaving the backyard in a total mess, and not giving a single word of apology, encouragement, or even the appearance of caring what it would do to me.  Some friend.  Just goes to show, you can't trust anybody.  Oh, and the water spigot out back?  Washu is the culprit, but only after VJ tied her to a metal pole about a foot from the spigot.  Not VJ's fault, but it shows that Diamond was planning on leaving me before the spigot was broken.  Speaking of not being able to trust your friends, it's come to my attention that Diamond has been cheating on me, kissing (and not your friendly peck on the cheek) Scooter.  I suspected she had feelings for him, but I had no idea she'd already started becoming intimate with him.  I've said I've forgiven the both of them, and I'm really trying in my heart to do that, but I will never be able to forget this, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to trust either of them ever again.  And Diamond wonders why I don't open up to people and make more friends.  When you read this, sweetheart, this is why.  Your friends screw you over when you're not looking.  The fewer friends you have, the fewer people there are to tear your heart apart by screwing you when you turn your back.

       She left me    Keep an eye on your email.  I'll be in touch.   That was the extent of my Dear John letter last night.  I come home to find the water spigot out back broken and spewing water - it had been doing so for at least 70 minutes, based on the file creation time of that letter she left for me in notepad on my desktop.  Her computer was gone, a bunch of boxes were gone, her shelf was cleaned off, her bike was gone, and there was no trace of her except that letter.  Shortly after I got home, the police showed up to check on me.  She had notified the police, but not left any contact information.  I like the way she cares, you know?  Yeah, have the police go check on me, but if I'm hurt or missing, so what, she doesn't care enough to have some way of them contacting her to let her know.  I call her work and talk to Jon, and get the number for Lori - a friend of hers whom I know she's familiar with enough to go over to her house and use her shower.  I don't like Lori.  She's the one Diamond was going to replace over at the Madill Record, but then her boyfriend left her, pregnant and all, so she's still hanging around over there.  She's going to be there when Ariel leaves.  Ironic, huh?  She's a bad influence, though.  She's not Christian, she's obnoxious, and she has the Feminazi vendetta against "men" in general.  I don't like her, but in an effort not to be a dictator of Diamond's time, I don't say anything about the times they've gone out together.  Nevermind that she has tried to tempt Diamond to do things I will speak up about behind my back.  I call Lori's place, and Diamond answers, and, indignantly as though I don't even have the right to speak to her, she demands "How did you get this number?"  She doesn't want to talk to me, she won't tell me what's going on, other than she needs some time separated from me so she can decide whether or not she wants to divorce me.  Lori won't bring her home, she won't come home, they won't give me the address so I can come get her, and I was to be left in the dark, not knowing what was going on, not knowing if she was safe, not knowing where she was.  I can not live like this.  I will not tolerate her temper tantrums, running away from home when she doesn't get her way.  She's mad because I don't want her to get a tattoo, and because we're about to move.  She, of all people, who whined and complained for a year and a half about this place, this state, this house,  everything , wants to stay because she has friends here.  Nevermind that I have no work here, nevermind that we have no family here, nevermind that we have no church here, no.. her friends are more important than all of that, and so if she can't have her way, she's going to punish me for wanting to do the right thing and move.

       A nation of cowards   We've all heard about how the  cowards  aboard the three planes which struck and destroyed the World Trade Center and part of the Pentagon, how they refused to fight back against a bunch of guys with  box cutters  of all things.  We've heard of the courage of the passengers of the fourth plane which crashed in rural Pennsylvania due to their efforts instead of hitting the Capitol Building in Washington DC.  If you think "cowards" is too strong a word to use, or that I should not speak in such a way about the deceased, tough.  We are a nation of cowards, regardless of how politically incorrect it is to say.  They had superior numbers, they were  not  outgunned, they merely sat back and let Islamic terrorists murder them and thousands of their fellow citizens.  But this is what our government wants.  Consider the fact that police and news media are   constantly   telling us that if we're ever mugged or threatened, to just capitulate.  Cower in fear, give them whatever they want, and forget about having a backbone.  The criminals are  predators  and everyone else should act as prey.  After all, if you tell the populace that they should stand up for their life or their wallet, then you are encouraging them to have a backbone to stand up to those who would oppress them.  Hello?  McFly?  Anybody home?  Our government is becoming more oppressive every day.  The Patriot Acts I and II, Homeland Security, unwarranted searches and seizures everywhere, loss of privacy, a war on the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, as our liberties are stripped from us daily.  If people start standing up to criminals, people will start standing up to the government, nevermind that our government is supposed to be  of, by, and for  the people.  This is why we're told to cower before a mugger on the evening news - this is why the police tell us that we're more likely to survive a home invasion if we give the invader what he wants - this is why laying down and doing nothing are applauded in popular culture such as the now defunct TV show "Ed."  In one particular episode, Ed and two women are mugged by a small guy with a "gun" (read: pointed finger) in his pocket, and they lay down on the ground like cowards.  Stuff like this teaches people that it's ok to be afraid and to cower before a violent criminal, no one will blame you for not fighting back, and people will applaud your "courage" by being able to go on and live your life after this traumatic experience.  What a load of malarky.  After the 9/11 incident, everyone had delusions of grandeur in which they are on a plane being hijacked by Islamic towel heads with boxcutters, and they lead a resistance movement and kick, punch, bite, and otherwise bloody the infidels into submission, saving the plane and their fellow passengers from certain doom.  Cut to late 2003, early 2004, and the Ohio shooter (he was  not  a sniper).   Standing out in the open, in broad daylight, in the middle of traffic, popping off rounds into oncoming traffic.  About two dozen incidents like this over a 10 month period, and not  one single individual ever had the courage to run this little peon over .  The guy gets out of his car, shoots at people, gets back in his car, and merges back into traffic and nobody around him does  anything .  Unless Americans abandon this spineless cowardice, the government is going to walk all over us, strip us of our rights, and destroy the America which so many have bled and died not only to preserve, but to create in the first place.

       Want attention?  Try to hide it    urlLink Nude statues get clothes - and sales   I've long believed that our attempt to hide our bodies has been a leading cause in the porn problem.  The above article makes my point for me very nicely.  Let's face it - we are creatures of curiosity.  We are very interested in everything,  especially  those things that are "off limits" to us.  It's why America has a problem with underage drinking, and most of Europe does not.  It's why America has a drug problem, and the nations who have decriminalized drugs do not.  When we understand that the human body - as God designed it - is not a thing to be ashamed of, many (though not all) of our problems with the issue with go away as well.  I'm not saying that turning America into one giant "clothing optional" nation will fix those problems - far from it.  But if we can get rid of the prudish "no one but your doctor and your spouse should see you naked", "it's shameful to be naked" mentality, it'd be a good start.  Take the news article for example - when the statues were naked, you didn't have old men stopping to stare at them.  It wasn't until the statues were covered up that interest in them was generated.  Think about it.

       And they shall call him Gooch   Today after Diamond's lunch break (and not one minute after she'd left, in fact) a black guy comes and knocks on our door, inquiring about who maintains the lawn at our house and our neighbor's house.  He then asks for a favor - from a total stranger - he asks me to take him for a ride to pick up a lawn mower so he can mow his yard.  Now, I can tell he's not all there upstairs, so rather quickly three thoughts run through my head;  either he's legit and needs a ride, he's getting me away from the house while his buddies rob the place, or he's trying to get me to help him steal a lawn mower.  Be all of this as it may, I grab my stuff and head out to help him.  The mower is about 3/4 a mile away, we get it and he goes to the neighbor's house and gets a gas can.  I drop him off, he jokes with some girl riding a lawn mower around on the street, and I head home to find everything intact.  Nifty.  Anyways, he's either a little slow on the uptake, or he'd toasted a few brain cells.  he looked to be about 30 or so, 6'5".. decent guy.  Oh, and yeah, his name's Gooch.

       Adequate Friday   I stopped by Boot Hill (the trash heap that passes for a gun range around here) to test fire my 1911 on the way home today.  It's still not locking back, so I replaced the full length recoil guide rod with the shorter one that came with the kit, thinking that the rod might be binding up on the bushing during cycling.  Functioning the gun manually  feels  smoother with the short one, leading me to think there may have been a bind,  but  it is still short cycling.  And yeah, I remembered on the drive home that I won't be able to get up with Dean about this tomorrow, since tomorrow is our Easter break day, so I guess I will have to wait until Monday to bother him yet again.

       Finishing the race   I am so ready to be done with this place!  I've got a ton of stuff left to do, and not a whole lot of time left to do it.  But that's beside the point - I'm tired of being here.  I'm growing restless again, eager to move on and escape the droll of daily muck which fills the halls of the Engineering Technology building of Murray State College.  It's nothing to do with my being tired of the  work , quite the contrary, I'd most likely work more if I could.  What I'm tired of is teachers that don't care about their students' progress.  Dean couldn't care less that my recoil spring may be too heavy and as such the slide doesn't function all the way to the rear of the frame, and, thus, doesn't eject shells like it should, and doesn't lock back on the last shot like it should.  I've chased him down three times now asking him for guidance.  The first time, he told me to get a lighter recoil spring - problem is, everyone was given the same one, so unless someone has bought their own additional spring, nobody has one, and frankly, I wouldn't go lending out parts of my gun to other people, nor would I expect them to do the same for me.  Anyways, I went and asked around, and yeah, either nobody has one, or nobody's willing to loan it out.  Second time I asked, he just told me to go through the gun and make sure there were no burrs, and to try firing the gun with a heavier load.  Ok, I can cycle the gun fine by hand, disassembled and reassembled, everything's peachy.. but I'm using a 230 grain factory load..  what the gun was designed to shoot .. and it's still not working.  So I ask him today a third time, and he just tells me to go get the gauge and check the weight of my recoil spring - it came up to 18lbs., by the way - and says he might have a lighter one to loan me so I can check it.  Now, an 18lbs. spring sounds like a lot, and when you try to compress it by hand, it feels like a lot, but considering what kind of force is coming off the end of the gun, and considering the slide is traveling back across the frame at 70 someodd miles per hour, 18lbs. isn't all that much.  I'm beginning to think I've got a bind somewhere else that just isn't showing up when I'm cycling the gun slowly by hand.  Anyways, I have no idea if he'll be around tomorrow or not for me to harrass, but if not, I'll just have to wait until Monday.  Everett Brunk, the guy that runs the tool room, is getting on my nerves.  He's an older fellow, and will be retiring when Dean does - May, 2005.  He's fat and lazy, a redneck, and a firm believer in the good ol' boy system.  Buy him lunch a couple times, and he's more than happy to help you with your questions, give you advice, et cetera.  If you can't, tough.  It's your gun, and if you break it while you're trying to machine it, tough, it's your problem.  "I'm just the tool room lady - you know more about that than I do."  He has the clock in the back of the room set 10 minutes fast, meaning he gets out 10 minutes early for lunch and dinner, but he won't open the machine shop back up until it's truly on the hour.  Now, our meal breaks run from, for example, 11:50am to 1:00pm.  But he closes the shop at 11:40.  They had to move all the cushioned chairs into the entrance of the machine shop because Penny, a Student Support Services worker (they have offices in our building) got tired of listening to his foul mouth and dirty jokes out in the hallway.  I'm tired of the elitist rednecks in the back of the room who have more money than they know what to do with, buying Dean and John and Everett lunch and sucking up to them, and subsequently being allowed to come and work in the machine shop on Saturdays when the campus is supposed to be closed (no, other students like myself aren't even supposed to know this goes on).  They order 300$ worth of Acraglass (out of the gun club funds - money they extort from students who do work for customers; more on this later), a bedding epoxy, just so they can get a deal on Leupold scopes, which, of course, they are the only ones who can afford them.  Gun club money does come from fund raisers, but last year, my freshman year, we were told the 10$ we were paying paid for our gun club dues for the entirety of our stay here at Murray - but we had to pay another 10$ this year.  We were told initially that our repairs we did for customers required 5$ be donated to the club - you get paid 15$, 5$ of that goes to the gun club.  Then it was 5%, because some refinishing jobs were running up prett high.  Then it was 10$.. then it was 15$.. now it's 20$, when some jobs don't even run that high.  In these cases, you get nothing - the customer buys the part, and your 10$ parts replacement job goes to the gun club.  I'm tired of all this extraneous crap going on, instructors that don't care (or worse, encourage it) and I'm ready to leave.  So close, yet still so far away.

       One shot...   ... one kill.  The motto of snipers.  I've finally got my rifle complete, but I haven't sighted it in yet, and I've yet to learn to shoot it accurately, but all in due time.     By the by, we've had new pictures made, which of course will be going up on the  urlLink bio  page.

       Where to start...   Saturday was a lot of fun.  We walked around the fair for most of the day.. from about 9:30 to about 4 or so, did the mall for a while, played in the arcade, Chik-Fil-A, and (drumroll) Hellboy!  Good movie, a little lacking in the storyline (maybe I missed it - exactly  what purpose  did the Sammael serve?  Other than stuff to fight?  Overall, pretty good, though.  Very fun, very funny, and a lot cleaner in the language department than I was expecting!  I mean a  lot  cleaner!  We spent Sunday over at Scooter's parents' house, breakfast, pool, nap, spreading sand for Jim, dinner, and hasta.  His parents are the coolest!  Tonight was game night, and I ran the pool tournaments - fun, I got to play in singles and doubles, and while I didn't win anything, it was a lot of fun.  Alan, Rodney, Micah, Scooter, Nancy, Diamond and I sat out in the grass in front of the dorm for about two hours afterward just talking, goofing off, and laughing ourselves into pain and headaches.  It was great!  But..   As soon as we got in the truck to head home, Diamond started in on me about how I want to "abandon" my friends here, and we talked about it (in tense voices - no shouting) on the way home.  She went to bed already, and I played Vice City (which we got Friday, more on this in a minute) for about 45 minutes or so before I went to write this and go to bed.  Now, considering the vast cost of Tulsa and my decision to forego it this time, I asked (suggested?) that we get a game - I'm bored in this house, I'm bored in this town, and the times like this past weekend are so few and far between as to be almost negligible - anyways, we pick up the GTA3/Vice City combo pack at Wal-Mart Friday, and while they're fun games, I'm feeling guilty for it this week.  It's true that I've played through the rest of our games to completion (for the most part; those I haven't I'm bored with) and I wanted something different, and since Diamond liked GTA3, we went with that.  I wanted  me  time since the Medfaire was for her, since game night tonight was going to be for her (this is the first time we haven't come straight home when it's over since everyone else always just goes home, too) so I wanted something to twiddle my thumbs with for the rest of the semester - only I really enjoyed myself this weekend and tonight, so now in hindsight I'm feeling a little selfish.  Note to self: when you're feeling left out and want to get in some  me  time, wait until after you've actually been left out before you start feeling sorry for yourself.

       Too little too late   50$ for a hotel room 60$ for food 15$ for the movie 50$ for gas 20$ for entry to the gun show  195$... we can't afford to go to Tulsa overnight, much less make the purchases I want (and need, in some cases) to make.  I need a couple screws for a Stevens 12 gauge break-open I'm working on - I thought I'd have this gun back to Jay this week, but the lack of screws and firing pin return spring have prevented this.  I had planned on getting them at the gun show, along with some books I wanted to buy, and I was also seriously considering the purchase of a vest I saw last year.  But an overnight trip to Oklahoma City and Tulsa is simply prohibitively expensive at this point in time, especially considering the fact that we're going to be moving in just over a month.  40$ for food 30$ for gas 15$ for the movie  85$ is how we're going to have to work it.  I was going to explain all the financial woes that we're in regarding "fun" money, but suffice to say:  I despise the situation we're in right now.   It wouldn't be as bad if I had been able to do work study like I have done for the past two semesters, but with a 25 credit hour class load, spending nearly 60 hours a week working in class, I didn't have time for work study.  Even now I'm falling behind and probably won't get done with the seven remaining projects I need to complete in the next 20 days of class available to me.  And that's counting Fridays (half days).  On a lighter note, my rifle is complete.  The rings do snap over, with some force I might add, but they're on and I've got a box (minus one) of .30-06 to sight in with next week.  The guy was down to his last box, and somebody had swiped a single round from it, so he sold me the whole box for 10$; half of what it was marked.  Thumbs up for pawn shop dude.  My apologies to Linda; your "Tard of the Day" post has been eliminated and you are restored to your previous status of Underpaid Peon.

       Lock 'n load: part 2   Test fired my 1911 today, and it fires just fine.  Ejection is another story, and the slide isn't locking back after the last round is fired, though, so I've got a little work to do somewhere.  I haven't altered the extractor or the ejector from the kits we've gotten; there is no angle set on the ejector yet, and the extractor may be putting too much pressure on the case and not letting go when it should.. either way, I'll bug Dean about it tomorrow or Monday.  The pistol is here with me at home, and I'm going to get the camera set up later tonight and take a couple pictures, at least one of which will find it's way here in a few hours.  I spoke with Dave concerning my scope ring woes today, and it was his opinion that the rings are supposed to snap over the scope tube.  Supposedly he's had to do it six or seven times in the past, and is adamant that this is what I'm going to have to do.  I'm going to take them in and show them to him and John tomorrow and get their hands-on opinion as to what should be done.  Hopefully they are snap-overs.  In the event they are, I'm going to have to take down Linda as the Tard of the Day.  ==========    It's not finished; this is not stainless steel.  Everything you see will be blued, and I'm getting rid of the wood grips in favor of rubber Hogue grips.  There are no sights installed; I'll be milling the dovetails for them next Thursday, most likely.  The grip safety (under the hammer) will be replaced, and the thumb safety is also going to be replaced with an ambidextrous thumb safety.  I'll get pictures of all of this up for you as soon as it's all done.

       When morons attack   Actually there's just one today, a veritable Tard of the Day winner.  One of my coworkers drives this old beat up hunk of junk, but it has those spinny hubcaps on it.  You know the kind - they spin even while the car is at a red light.  Anyways, this individual of exceptional intellectual stature discovered something interesting with one of her tires today.  "There's metal wires in car tires!"  It seems that the tread is so worn on her tires that they're starting to expose the internal structure of the tire, and they're really not safe to drive on at this point (duh!).  So we tell her to call her husband or someone to come put her spare tire on the car, but then she tells us she  can't  because she had the spare tire taken out of the car so her speakers would fit in the trunk.    Hello?  McFly?    But hey, at least she'll have her bass when she's stranded on the side of the road, and all the neighborly people who stop to help her change a flat can't do anything for her.

       Free at last   I've really fallen out of the habit of blogging as of late, given the lack of internet access for so long.  Also, the last  eight straight days of work without a day off  haven't exactly helped, either.  My days are getting mixed together and I'm staying up until 4 and 5am, but it's ok.  Lots of stuff to tell, but I'm not here to share tonight - just trying to get myself back into the habit of coming and doing something in here.  Ciao, kids.

       Another day, another moron   The last couple of days of work haven't been too bad.  Last night, Sunday night, I worked with Billy - I guess he's about 40, 45, somewhere along there.  Anyways, this is the guy who filled in at Elkmont for me two years ago when we left for Oklahoma.  Now, he's quitting, and I'll most likely be getting his hours on Sunday evenings.  Ironic, huh?  Today was also a not bad day, and in the truest sense of the phrase, I bring to you again the Tard of the Day.  This guy is short.. he comes up to about the bridge of my nose.  Yes, he shaved his head.  Yes, he has lots of other tattoos.  But there was one in particular on the base of his neck done up to look like the "Triple X" character's XXX tattoo from Vin Diesel's movie.  No real accomplishment has earned him this title today, other than being a tattooed fanboy.  Oh, and the Xs weren't even in the same style as the movie.  They overlapped a little, but they looked like a typing font of some sort.   Lame

       We're back!   We're back online, after a seemingly interminable week of no internet.  It's amazing how much I use this, even when I think to myself that I use it so little.  I'm working at Lucky's now.. it's a grocery store in Decatur.  I'm 3rd manager, night shift, full time.  It's not bad, but it's not what I want.  I'm going to be looking for a gunsmithing (or related) position in the near future, most likely starting next week.  Here's hoping I can get a job with  reasonable  hours, that gives me my weekends and evenings at home.  Not even a week back working with the public, and I already hate the people who come in to shop.  I am reminded of the... well...  trash  that comes in driving a Cadillac and answering their cell phone, yet buys their food, and candy, and ice cream, and chips, and scads of other unneccessary food items with food stamps and WIC checks.  I already   despise   the government handouts, and it's these people that drive me to rage.  You're welcome, you worthless lumps of flesh.  The taxes of the working class (read: me and countless others like me) are going to pay for your steaks so you can afford to buy your beer.

       Ow   Well, we're finally back in Alabama.  Friday's trip was very short, since Diamond got tired a lot earlier than I was expecting.  We ended up stopping in Clarksville, Arkansas for the night around 2:30am, and left out again around 10:45am.  Saturday's trip was plagued with congested traffic right off the bat, from about 5 miles and an hour of slow going because the  morons  in eastbound I-40 were gawking at a wreck which occured in the  westbound  lanes.  Sure, there was a police car on the left shoulder of the east lanes, but he wasn't slowing traffic, he wasn't closing a lane, it was still two fully open lanes.  I really hate people, sometimes.  After that was some construction which slowed things down, albeit not nearly as much as the gawkers, but after Little Rock things went pretty smooth all the way to Memphis.  Memphis isn't bad, unless you're on I-40 and looking for Highway 72.  We've missed the turnoff every time we've gone through Memphis, but up to this point, every time has been in the middle of the night and we'd assumed we've just missed it.    Nope!    There is no signage, no indicator of where to turn off for Highway 72.  Nothing.  Nada.  Zilch.  Zip.  We finally got off someplace familiar.. the same dreck we went through last Christmas in Memphis, and we even stopped at the same gas station, unintentionally.  I checked a map there, got my bearings, and then as we got ready to pull out of the parking lot, something occurred up on the north side of the intersection.. another wreck.  This time, much more significant.  It closed down both lanes of northbound traffic, clogging cars in the intersection, and they had three police out there directing traffic.  We sat in that little snafu for 30 minutes, the whole time only trying to turn around.  We get turned around, headed in the direction which the map had indicated, and it put us right back where we'd started.  I decided to forget the map and go with my original intent, which was to head east on 385 until we got to someplace where I was familiar with, and finally got ourselves on track after an hour and a half in Memphis (which involved our generous donation of 10$ to some guy looking for an "alternator belt."  Difficulties with our debit card from Redstone didn't help, either.  We had something like 465$ in the checking account for it, and I know gas is expensive, but we didn't spend nearly that much before the card started getting declined for some reason unknown to us.  The "help line" on the back of the card only helps if you're trying to report a lost or stolen card.  Somebody tell me something... if you lose the card, then you're not going to have the phone number on the back of the card unless you wrote it down somewhere ahead of time.  Does this not make sense to anybody else???  I have the card, I need help  with  the card.. arghgh!  After Memphis, though, everything went smoothly.  We got into Athens around 10:45pm last night - about 4 hours behind schedule.  That is by far the worst move I've ever had the displeasure of participating in.  But I'm glad to be back.

       Down to the wire   I'm pretty sure of where we're going to be living, at least for the next year.  After that, I think we may end up trying to buy a house, but I just don't know.  The landlord seems a tad paranoid, and coming from me, that's saying something.  There's still a lot to be done here, a lot to pack and get ready, but most of what's left is daily use items like the computers, the television, dishes, clothes.. that sort of thing.  Even so, a lot of these items are already packed, anyways.  I'm planning on getting a U-haul tomorrow morning, and the loading of the truck will commense and will most likely last through Friday afternoon, after which we'll probably try and get some rest before we're off.  It's exciting, really, the way moving always is.  Preparing to go someplace "new", even though I've lived there for four years prior, there's still the element of adventure in moving.  I'll likely make one more post prior to disassembling the system here, but in case I don't, I'll see you on the other side.  Ciao, kids.

       In this corner  Weighing in at almost every weight imaginable... life, and all that surrounds it.  I may very well have been wrong about Scooter and Diamond's intentions, and the coming around that Diamond has had over the past 10 days aren't some scheme to trick me, and Scooter really has resigned himself to the fact that she and I are not separating.  Still, though, I sleep with one eye open.  We went shooting yesterday afternoon, after VJ's luau party thingy, which was a load of fun.  Mostly I just sat around snacking and talking, but we did play frisbee for a little while.  I used to be able to catch a frisbee under my leg, but I'm out of practice.  Scooter came, as he had been invited, but he only stayed for about an hour, and that only after we chatted and coerced him for two hours.  He was really distressed and probably peeved at me and the way I'd been acting lately, and seemed like he didn't want to have much to do with me, even after apologies and forgiveness and the shaking of hands and making up.  Anyways, we stayed another hour and a half, maybe two hours, I forget now, but when we left, we decided that we'd run by his place once more and invite him out again if he wanted - no pressure this time.  Amazingly, he accepted, and we went out to the range.  He's not too good with a pistol, but for crying out loud, it's the first time he's ever shot one.  I think the sights on the 1911 are a bit off, as today was the first time I'd shot with it, and I could barely hit anything.  We played with the 16 gauge a bit, and it's  much  easier to handle with a recoil pad!  Fired the Mauser a bit, and I was going to try and sight it in, but I forgot targets, and the cardboard we found already had a gazillion holes in it, so tracking was pretty much out of the question.  Pulled the pistols out again and shot cans and whatnot off the broken benchrest.  Diamond got one right at the bottom and it was great fun watching it arc some 10 feet into the air.  I had another shell in my pocket, and decided to have a bit of fun - set up the cans and gatorade bottles and took two out at a time.  Set them up again and loaded a full magazine, and tried again, but I got the same two.  No problem - rack the pump and right side, left side.. man that was fun.  Diamond decided she wanted to try, but instead of a line, we piled them all together, and watching everything get knocked off and ripped apart was hilarious.  Scooter tried it once or twice, same way with the "targets", and it couldn't have been planned any more perfect.  A perfect arc of targets and 10, 11, 1 and 2 o'clock, all going about the same height no less.  No coffee for us that day, but nonetheless, it was great fun had by all.

       I hate my life   I've got a job lined up, just about ready to go in Decatur.  It's a lateral step from what Diamond is making now.. same gross income and all that.  I think there's maybe a 35$ difference, actually, but in any case, it's only barely going to be enough to live on, and Diamond is going to be taking a job whose funds are going to be going almost 100% to our debts.  Not too bad a deal, really, until you consider all the fine details.  Mine is going to be a night job, I'll probably be getting off around 9:30pm, get home probably around 10, and hey, it's bed time.  She wants to go to school full time  and  work, which are going to eat up her mornings and days, so if things continue along this path, I'm hardly ever going to see her for the next couple of years.  Given the stresses of our marriage over the past month, I tell you, this is starting to sound like  a very bad thing .  I nearly lost her because I wasn't around emotionally, and now I'm not going to be around physically, and I'm afraid that this is going to stress things too far.  There's not a whole lot I can do about it right now, since I can't look for day work until we're out there, and even then I really don't like the idea of letting down Ian like that, since he's pumped me up before Mr. Graham for who knows how long now.  It won't look good on him for me to show up and work for three months before I quit and take another job, and I don't want to do that to him.  I want to do it for myself, as I'd rather work a regular 8-5 job anyways, and I'd  much  rather be doing gunsmithing as opposed to Assistant Manager at some grocery store.  There's nothing wrong with that work, it's just   really not what I want to do   but my hand is being forced, and it's being forced into what I feel is a very bad place.  I've got two degrees now; I don't want the first, and I can't do anything with the second.

       A bit confused   Ever since I told my mom about Diamond's kissing and fooling around behind my back, she's been very wary about her sexual fidelity towards me.  I have also, even before my mother was told.  Mom has questioned Diamond on just about every conceivable front, from that, to her indecisiveness concerning our marriage, to her faith, to her ability to maintain a stable marriage with me.  I have had these same doubts in my own mind, even before mom voiced them, so she isn't the source of these doubts,  but ... why am I offended when mom voices these doubts, yet I find no offense in my own questions that I ask Diamond, usually on a daily basis?  In my mind, for some reason, it's been ok for me to question Diamond, but it's not ok for mom to do so.  The event which triggered this thought is a question I presented to mom today regarding what she thought about us purchasing a house.  She replied quickly and definitively in the negatory - much to my surprise, really.  I asked her why, and she told me that she thought Diamond was too unstable to enter into that kind of comittment at the present.  Now, that thought has occured to me, as well as the distress over Diamond's return to school and everything that will entail, especially with me working nights.  She's going to want to go to school activities, the likes of which led to her meeting Scooter, and I'm afriad she's going to meet someone else,  especially  since I'm not going to be able to attend.  I've thought and I suppose I still do to some extent, that since I have been wholly adamant against dissolving our marriage on her terms, that the recent divulging of information to me regarding her extramarital activities and her recently voiced desire to make this marriage work have been an attempt to break down my guard, and simultaneously provoke me to dissolve our marriage on my terms.  Diamond knows I think this sometimes, and when I first told her, she actually  thanked  me for even thinking that she could come up with something that clever.  For some reason, this reply from her makes me trust her even less, especially considering that I would not put such a strategy beyond either her or Scooter.  Probably because an instant acceptance of my offer would be too suspicious.  I suppose my dislike of my mother's advice against trusting Diamond is offensive to me because I love her, but mom's loyalty ends with me.  Like many parents take offense at anyone else disciplining their child, I am taking offense at anyone else questioning my Diamond.  As for whatever mindgames which may or may not be playing out between Scooter, Diamond, and myself, I think my best course of action for the next week is to play buddy to Scooter to appease Diamond's insistence that we all "just get along."  Frankly, I don't trust him, and I don't think I ever will.  Whether or not I ever trust Diamond again is something I'm going to have to wait until Alabama to truly begin delving into, and her beginning school when I can not attend the extracurricular functions with her so I can keep an eye on her probably isn't going to help the situation.. coupled with the fact that we're up to our eyeballs in debt.  Two loans from our time at Virginia College, truck payments, plus all my student loans from here at Murray, and she wants to take on more debt so she can attend school??  I am all for her going back to school.. but... right  now ?  She's talked about getting a job to offset the cost, and to help pay debts... I don't know what to do, really, and not knowing what is actually going to happen between now and this Fall is bothering me.  I hate my physical limitations... really, I do.

       Bored out of my gourd   Dungeons and Dragons has to be the most boring and frustrating game that attempts to be passed off as  entertainment  on the face of the planet.  I've been gaming for about three weeks now with a couple of guys I met through a guy at school, and in those three weeks I've had to make two characters.  The books are merely tools of Legion, for they are many.  For someone who does not know all the ins and outs and little tricks and gimmicks and "cheats", creating a character is an effort in futility.  You end up making a character that doesn't stand a snowball's chance, because you can't find all the uber plane of time gear (for all you EQers out there) to buy for your character.  Yes, buy.  I'm handed about four books in which I'm supposed to instantly absorb and thus know how to create a character, determine all of his statistics, equip him (and the equipment list doesn't even list the simple stats of the armor and weapon pieces - you're expected to know those already, and if you don't, tough), set up all of his feats, his skills, his attributes and abilities... I spent five hours last night building up one character, and when I was "through" I found out that no, I'm not through, I'm not nearly through, because there were huge sections of information I didn't know needed to be found, and once found, I didn't even last a single round in combat.  Why?  Because I didn't know about some tomes that turn you into a  god  or some such, so my character got it handed to him on a silver platter.  We're moving at the end of next week... I'm hoping last night was my last tour of duty in the realm of D&D.

       A one week pause   Postponing the move by one week.  Diamond is upset about leaving, as she probably should be.  We're leaving behind some good friends, but at the same time, a lot of them are moving away soon, too.  We're just the first group to part ways.  I don't know how to comfort her, I don't know what to say... it's easy to ignore her and just let her mourn, and when she gets mad at me for ignoring her, as I suspect she will, my only defense is going to be saying that I'm trying to give her space.  She was filling her water bottles earlier, and when one fell off, I stepped up and started to fill it while she screwed the top on another one.  She was very short with me when she asked me to let her do it.  I tried to give her a hug, but she really didn't want it.  It's driving me nuts.. when someone else says "you look like you need a hug" she's all about it, but when it comes from me, she keeps pulling away.  I ask her what she wants me to do, and  still  all she tells me is "I don't know."  I'm trying, and at times I make progress, but at times like this, she's standing in my way, often pushing me back.  I lose ground, and if I stand my ground, she takes offense.

       Ten point five gets a three   That NBC monstrosity, 10.5, is beginning it's second night of torturing America right now, and I thought I'd go ahead and share my thoughts before my mind is too numb to type.  It's a  bad  attempt at a "24" style action drama.  Diamond said it best.. it's way too formulaic - too predictable, and too patterned.  Heroine scientist lady knows  exactly  what's going on, but since no technology exists to measure deep enough to see what's going on, no one except a good friend at work believes her, and because they ignore her, San Fransisco residents get pummeled.  There's your predictable at odds father and daughter out for some special time together to try and mend their troubled relationship, and they get cut off from wife/mom who just happens to be the governor of California.  Then of course there is the troubled family, dad is a doctor, and in this feminist wad of fetid tripe, he is of course irresponsible, disregarding the wants and needs of his wife and two kids to go and buy himself a new car, but despite their troubles, they are separated by the quake and only communicate by phone.  Yes, this movie is a feminist wad of rotting cow intestine.. the hero ine  scientist, the  female  governor of California, the  responsible  parent is always the woman.. with as blatently over the top as this movie is with everything else, they didn't do a very good job of muffling the feminazi overtones in the writing, either.  The emphasis which the actors use in their lines is the same as "24", the camera zooms and multi-window simultaneous events are the same.. it even has the "at first skeptical, but now convinced" mean boss (who happens to be male) who disbelieved scientist chick and is now on site with an Armageddon-style drill through the rock and plant a nuke scheme.  Hey, NBC, do yourself a favor and look up "original" in the dictionary, and apply it to your next movie miniseries, eh?

      Fire and Ice by Robert Frost  Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. From what I’ve tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate To know that for destruction ice Is also great And would suffice.

       Finito           There you are.. before and after.  All in all, this was a fun project, and I'll probably end up doing these professionally.  I've decided that rifles and semi autos are my favourites, and I'm probably going to specialize in them, and leave shotguns and revolvers to other people.

       I've just had an apostrophe   I am not what most would consider a "confident" man.  I am not confident in my decisions, because I overthink them and inevitably find some way for something to fail, so I go back to the drawing board and the cycle starts anew.  Call it "creative procrastination."  I do not assert myself in situations of conflict.  Rather, I view myself as an individual who will ride out the storm and only put my foot down when a situation tilts against me, and threatens me in some way.  Because of these shortcomings, I do not command respect among my peers or my elders.  Granted, I think Mike put it best when he stated that I have a steel core, and I will not bend on matters of principle or ethics.  I believe this is a  good thing  and I will keep this trait, but I need to be more assertive and more confident in my daily goings on.  The boys who work at Lucky's do not truly respect me, so much as the position I hold.  They know that if they cross anyone in my position, fire and brimstone will rain down not from me, but from Dodie or Ray.  Tonight an individual came to the store complaining that this was the third time he had acquired a propane tank from us that "didn't work."  I knew what the problem was.. the guy's a tard and doesn't know how to screw hose A into socket A so that gas may flow from the tank to his grill.  Big deal.  But instead of just handling the situation myself, I found myself relating the situation to Bud and asking him what to do about it.  As it turns out, my first thought was the correct thought - offer to exchange it, and if that's not good enough, tell him to come back in the morning and take it up with the store manager.  But for some reason, even though I had the authority given to me by my employer, I neglected to use it, instead deferring to another.  Diamond made a comment a few days ago about her inability to respect me, and while I did not delve any deeper into the concept, I think I have found a thread which leads to this fray in the seam of my composition.  I also think it high time to correct this character flaw.  Who knows - perhaps I am not complete with the self improvements necessary to instill trust into Diamond's heart once again.

       Laying down my burdens   I have tried and sought and worked diligently to win back the affection and love of my wife, yet to this day I have had no definite success.  Granted, there have been minor improvements, but she still can not tell me that she loves me, and mean it in the way a wife  should  mean it to her husband.  What she shares with me is the same "I love you" as she gives to a friend, for to her, I am merely a friend like any other.  I have gone through spurts of renewed hope and strength that inspire me to keep trying, to persevere, and to maintain my present course, but in truth, I am spent.  I am lonely tonight, without anyone to talk to or to share my day with... without anyone to share with me their day.  And even if Diamond were here with me now, I wouldn't care to hear about her day.  I hate her job because of the distance it puts between us.  What's more, she loves her job so much, and her precious job is more important than our marriage.  I have always prioritized my family above work, and of course while I am not going to quit a job because I only get one day a week with my wife, I am at least contemplating how I might secure a  real  9-5 job.  She couldn't care less about finding employment that would allow her a reasonable sleep schedule, much less (if that were even possible) time with which to work on her family.  In truth, I still love her, and I still cherish her, but she is pushing me away and beating back my attempts to reach out to her, and so I think it is time for me to relent and let her have her way.  Again.  Besides, I don't need her anymore.  I am at a point in my life where I want love, and attention, and affection, but I realize now that I do not need these things to come from her.  She has left me in the past, and wants to do so again - and when a spouse leaves, the remaining individual is freed from the vows taken.  There are other reasons which prompt me to realize that my needs may be filled by women other than she, but I will refrain from listing them at present for reasons previously mentioned.

       Coming out of the closet   No, I'm not gay, and I don't even play one on TV, but in any case, I know how they feel.  For the past few months, I have been dealing with a new aspect of my life that is a huge change from what I always believed as a youth, primarily because I belived what most of mainstream society believes and teaches youths such as myself.  Imagine that, eh?  This epochal revelation would, I fear, alienate myself and my wife from our family and friends, our church, our workplaces... everything.  What could be so damaging, you ask?  I dare not say, lest all of the aforementioned come to my home with torches and pitchforks to beat down my door and cleanse this house.  Stay tuned, readers, and in due time the mystery will be revealed.  In the mean time, should you wish to assure me that there is of course nothing that I could say or do that would cause such a revolt among your midst, feel free to leave a comment.  Sometimes I wonder why I even added a comment system - nobody ever uses it.

       Setting goals   My current weight is 206, and my BMI is 30.1, just barely over the line for obesity.  I think it's time for me to set a goal, instead of just going day to day hoping for some sort of change.  So here it is - I want to get my weight down near 145, 160 if I'm going to keep up with the body building.  So here it is: 60lbs in 60 weeks.  August 20, 2005 is my shoot-for date.  I'll be putting my exercise regimine and accomplishments on a page under the Bio page of my website, along with my dietary guidelines.  Here goes nothing.

       Tards, tards, everywhere   And I can't smack any of them.  Today's tard isn't really an individual, but rather is every Tom, Dick, and Harry that doesn't know how to look at the little emblem on the card readers to figure out how their card is supposed to swipe.  I mean really, people!  Some lady came in today, and her line has been echoed at least 100 times since I started work there only six weeks ago.  In regards to the readers, "Oh, every one is different," because she didn't get her card to swipe correctly the first time.  Nevermind that there is a  picture  for all the illiterate morons out there who can't read instructions on how to position your card so it will swipe correctly.  Dear God, how do these people operate a vehicle with only symbolic signs out there to guide them?

       Cry just a little   Normally I am vehemently opposed to that cancer known as country music, but on very, very,  very  rare occasions I hear one I like, or with lyrics that, to me, actually have meaning.  Remember how I said I wanted revenge?  I think this song sums up what I want much more eloquently than I was capable of doing.  ==========  Faith Hill - Cry  If I had just one tear running down your cheek Maybe I could cope maybe I'd get some sleep If I had just one moment at your expense Maybe all my misery would be well spent  Yeah....  Could you cry a little Lie just a little Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain I gave now I'm wanting Something in return So cry just a little for me  If your love could be caged, honey I would hold the key And conceal it underneath the pile of lies you handed me And you'd hunt those lies They'd be all you'd ever find And that'd be all you'd have to know For me to be fine  Yeah.... And you'd cry a little Die just a little and baby I would feel just a little less pain I gave now I'm wanting  Something in return So cry just a little for me  Give it up baby I hear your goodbye Nothing's gonna save me I can see it your eyes Some kind of heartache Darlin' give it a try I don't want pity I just want what is mine  Yeah... Could you cry a little Lie just a little Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain I gave now I'm wanting Something in return So cry just a little for me  Yeah... Cry just a little for me  ==========  I'm trying very hard to rid myself of this abhorrent attitude, because really, what's the point?  Stopping to think this morning, and talking with Ian today at work, and having all evening to think about what's really going on between Diamond and I, my desire to see her hurt over me is rather childish and vindictive, not to put too fine a point on it.  Playground rules no longer apply - if Timmy hurts Bobby, Bobby doesn't get a free punch on Timmy.  It's music like this, and the trash that listens to it and accepts it as ethical advice for life as though it was uttered forth from the lips of Dr. Laura (pbuh) are the ones who are turning this world into a moral cesspool.  Maybe that's why my efforts to reconcile with my wife have been met with a brick wall at every turn.  And the world, in unison, recited from the book of D'uh, chapter 5, starting at verse 10.  I think perhaps my desire for such retribution is tied in some way to the loss of my faith, and my questioning of God's word and concern for my being.  Mind you, those specific items currently remain unchanged, but the food for thought I've had today has had time to digest, and, lo, there was a Mild Awakening, and all the host of heaven did proclaim "...meh..."  Whatever.  You guys can all get lost - all I want now is my wife back.  I guess the proclamation here is  fugetabatit .  What's more important to you, hmm?  Satisfaction over Diamond hurting for my love and affection, or  obtaining   her  love and affection?  I thought so.

       To everything there is a season   and a time to every purpose under the heaven. Ecclesiastes 3:1  I have held on to the pain and injustice that Diamond has inflicted upon me for a long time now.  She has done evil, evil things to me, and to our marriage.  There are many things that I have forgiven her for in the past, but the events of the past three months have stuck in my mind so relentlessly that I've sought revenge against my beloved.  I have wanted to make her hurt in the same way that I have hurt.. I have wanted her to yearn for me the same way I have yearned for her.. I have wanted her to feel like she's losing me the same way I've been losing her.  In the fog of my not-quite-clear thinking, I have known that if she really doesn't care about me, then none of what I am trying to do will be effective, but I have hoped and believed that even though she says she's not in love with me, that truly she is, but perhaps doesn't quite realize it, or at the very least isn't prepared to admit it.  In any case, we're at a point in our relationship where both of us are ready for the back and forth bickering to be finished.  We've decided that for now, we're not going to separate, in the sense that we're not going to be living in different households, but I am moving to a separate section of the house.  We're not going to see each other as much, but I have to stop complaining about her job and the strain that it's putting on our already strained marriage.  I stated last night that she loves her job more than she loves our marriage, and while she objected at first, after mulling it over for a minute or two, she more or less agreed with my assessment.  I don't like this arrangement, but it's better than her moving out of the house entirely.  Marital bedroom time will continue as "normal" but the rest is pretty much.. oh, how did she put it.. "it has to be like we're not living together at all," I think is a reasonable paraphrase of what she said.  I can't quite remember her exact wording.  Dear God, I love her.. but I'm so tired and distressed by the bickering back and forth.  I have prayed for this to end, and no end is given.  My faith is weakening, and nothing that anyone has said or done has helped in curbing that waning glint.  To everyone out there who bothers to read this pathetic little blog, please, pray for my faith, and pray for my marriage.  I can not bear to lose my Diamond.  Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. James 5:16  Why then do my prayers have no effect?  I am not righteous in the eyes of God.

       The vicious cycle   Every time I think things are starting to get better, something like  urlLink this  crops up.  Diamond got a shop at TGIFriday's and so we went there for dinner Wednesday night.  The shop required her to purchase an alcoholic drink, so she got a Long Island Iced Tea, which got her drunk.  When we'd bowl with Scooter and he'd insist on getting a pitcher of beer, she'd get drunk.  Anybody who knows me knows that I have no problem with people drinking, but losing your sobriety is a severe problem, and with Diamond, it's pushing me away from her.  After that, we went for coffee, and I was in a mood.  I wanted to talk, but she's basically told me to shut up about us, or else.  Then I read in her blog above that she really wanted Scooter there to have coffee with us, after she's promised me over and over and over and over again that it's over, and   every single time she promises me this, I find out that she isn't  .  She dressed up half goth, half something happy, and looked miserable in it the whole night.  Tons of other little things that grated on me the whole night, and then she posts  that .  I haven't wanted it to come to this, but I think it's time to end this relationship.  I'm tired of being dragged back into the mire that she's created for us time and time and time again.  Certain other people are putting too much pressure on me to suck it up, that this is all my fault, "you made your bed, now sleep it in," and paying no regard at all to the fact that most of this is Diamond's fault  by her own admission .  This isn't worth my time, my health, or my sanity.  I'm outta here.

       Tard squared   Some old couple comes in this afternoon, sometime around 5:00, and manages somehow to go through the grocery store without incident.  Once they get to the checkout line, oh, does it hit the fan.  We have weekly sales which, in order to get the sale price, customers must collect these little stamps and affix them to a card which we provide them with, 40 stamps to a card.  This lady decides that she wants, in addition to her other purchases, two packages of coffee, and three packages of paper towels, all of which are on this special sale.  To start with, she only brought two filled cards, as opposed to the needed five.  The other three she brought were  blank .  "Well, I wanted the towels, but I'm not going to pay  that  price for them," she says, in regards to the .40$ higher non-sale price of her ill fated acquisition, and of course has us remove them from her ticket.  Then when she is quoted her total, a whopping 26$ and odd change, "I did  not  spend that much in this store.  You've overcharged me for something, miss," she growls at Camill, who is taking it all in stride.  Upon checking the price of her pickles, she decides she doesn't want that 3$ item, and there's something else she has Camill take off, which brings her total to 21something.  "You are overcharging me for something, miss, I did  not  spend that much in this store, now please, fix it, now.. I only got..." and proceeds to mention item after item, each time stopping as though she  thinks  it's the last one in her cart.  Finally I go get a calculator and we go through her receipt (all the while a chuckling line is forming behind the lady) and, lo, her charge actually  is  21$ and change.  "Well, with these prices, I'll just forget those towels.  I don't think I'm going to be coming in here again anytime soon."  Yeah, I'm going to lose sleep over that one.  A little while later, after we've got the line she created taken care of, one of the other employees turns to me and comments that the Tard Queen is of some relation to  urlLink the attacking moron .  Why am I not surprised.

       Nothing ever changes   Every night I come home from work, hopeful that something has changed in our marriage, but it never happens.  Every morning when I awake, shortly after Diamond comes home from work, I am hopeful that she has realized something new for me in the time she has had to think while at work, but it's never there.  Am I to be thankful that her presence is here with me, while her heart and soul evade even a passing glance?  Am I to rejoice in her dispassionate countenance merely because it exists?  I am asked..  told  to do these things.  It is  demanded  that I rejoice in my misery that is the absence of sworn love from the greatest blessing that has ever come into my life.  I am berated for my lack of strength, this failure, as though it is by choice and choice alone that we are able to carry on.  What then of her choice to abandon?  Is she to be uplifted in her choosing to depart, while I am punished in my inability to withstand the torrent of despair and loneliness?  The disparity weighs heavily on me, like weights about my ankles; the shackles of poor decisions and sinful actions - some my own.  As the day draws nigh to close A new day longs to arise I find myself in both shoes -  Ready for my journey to End, like the last day's chiming Bell, and ready for a fresh New start, but the clock hands stand Immobile, and thus Forever do I end.

       Moving back up   Last Tuesday I slipped on the stairs coming up from the basement, and since I was barefoot, it of course hurt  badly .  I had a nice cut on the bottom of my second toe on my left foot for a couple days, and while it really only hurt in the mornings if I was barefoot, or in the water in the shower, it slowed me down while running for a couple days.  Last night, I jogged again, as I am wont to do, and while I didn't improve my time on my first run, my second lap's time improved dramatically.  Even with my wounded foot Tuesday night, my second lap time dropped to 8:23 from 9:02, and last night dropped again to 8:08.  I've stopped seeing real progress with my first lap, at least for the time being, but the second lap's progress is encouraging.  I've come to realize over the past couple of days that my speed and endurance is being affected by my inability to take in enough oxygen while I'm running.  I'm getting out of breath very quickly in my running, and towards the end I know I'm not getting enough air into my lungs.  I'm not exactly sure what the problem is.. it feels like my lung capacity should be much greater.. like I should be inhaling a much larger volume of air, but my lungs either can't stretch far enough to accomodate, or the volume of my chest cavity will not allow for the expansion of my lungs to the necessary capacity.  If anyone out there has any ideas or suggestions, I'm all ears.  I'm about to have to get ready for work, but I'll probably be doing a bit of research tonight to see what I can find out.

       A look back in history   I have known that Diamond has had a livejournal account for some time now, and I  thought  I'd gone to the beginning and read all the way through, but the bug caught me again today to go and reread everything, and I discovered a significant number of posts I never knew existed.  Reading through these posts, I feel that her recent (within the past 2 months) accusations against me have been incorrect, sort of like how people say things they don't really mean when they're angry.  The difference being, I think she's told herself how bad things were over and over and over again that she believes things really were absolutely horrible between us.  From her very first post,  urlLink March 8, 1999 : I still try not to think about losing my parents, or Ryan, or friends, but I know it will happen someday. I pray it is not for many many years though. I can’t bear the thought of having to go on without my dear husband...  I've always been there for her, I've always cared about her wellbeing  urlLink February 11, 2002 : My poor hubby sat on the couch and cried tonight while holding the places that are spasming while I yelled and yelled over the pain. I feel so bad making him cry like that -_-  She's thankful for  urlLink March 2, 2002 : 2.) That even though my husband and I fight sometimes, we can be adults about it and make things right between us.  Even though she's told me recently that she thought I was only trying to control her,  urlLink March 25, 2002 : I really should be happy, you know. I should be thankful that I have a great husband who thinks I'm really all that - and I am thankful...I just wish I could live up to that belief, you know what I mean? I really don't deserve to have wound up with such a great guy.  urlLink April 19, 2002 : Frankly, I'm grateful for it, because it means that he really does find me attractive.  She's told me that she never thought I paid attention to her,  urlLink March 28, 2002 : It's cool that he already noticed. I didn't realize he paid THAT much attention to me. LOL!  She's told me that she  always  hated me for mocking her about her dieting,  urlLink April 19, 2002 : Me: I'm not asking you to shut up. I'm just asking you to stop making fun of me for it. (A slight exaggeration, as he hasn't actually targeted me personally.)  She's told me she never thought we should have moved to Oklahoma, and always hated the idea,  urlLink April 20, 2002 : I hope anyone reading this will pray for him to make the right decision. I still believe moving is what we're supposed to do because things are still moving in that direction   ==========  There's more, but I'll stop there.  Diamond, when you read this, please get my attention so we can sit down and talk.  I love you, sweet.

       A 2 day hiatus   I took a 2 day break over the weekend, as apparently I pulled or have started to stretch new muscles in my abdomen whilst running, and didn't really feel like exerting myself and inflaming the situation.  Anyways, tonight's run was without incident, though I think I've reached a plateau in my speed.  6:23 tonight - not bad, but it was nice to see the seconds dropping so rapidly over the past couple of weeks.  In other news, our Tard of the Day is of the 2nd grade reading comprehension variety.  I overheard in the store today some woman ask (in perfect Ebonic) "This say it'six cheese, what that mean?"  Figure it out, lady... "six" - "cheese" --  duh!

       What did you call me?   I went running tonight, even though it's not a scheduled night, primarily because I don't have my gym stuff setup yet and I want to do  something .  A couple nights ago I had an idea to walk around a much smaller adjacent block after each lap as a sort of cool down period between laps.  Last night I tried it for the first time, and it worked so well I decided I'd make it a regular part of the workout.           Anyways, I do so again tonight, and just as I'm coming around the last corner, our honorary Tard of the Day pulls up to the stopsign and yells out the passenger window at me, "Hey, Bitch!"  I turn ever so nonchalantly to face this moron, and in seeing his white-trash pickup truck that's been beat to hell and back, I decide that Cletus here isn't worth my time, and return to my walk.  He drives off, but in doing so continues to spout profanities in my general direction.  What a tard.       My best guess is that he thought I was someone else, or truly was being a tard and just trying to pick a fight with someone.  Be that as it may, I may end up figuring out a way to rig a holster to carry with me on my runs.  All I need is for tards like this to get violent with a vehicle and me on foot.  Oh, and by the way, my time was 6:12 tonight... so close, yet so far away.  It was kind of a rough run, especially since I've discovered that I want to inhale and take deeper breaths than I am capable of while I'm running, so I'm getting really out of breath towards the end of the course.  More practice, I suppose.

       I hate the new changes   I hate the new changes to Blogger, namely the post screen which now does not show your previous posts and which now drags you off to a whole new page to tell you that your blog is being published.  There was nothing wrong with the old New Post page, which had everything you needed right there ready for you to use.  Now you have to hop around six or seven pages to get everything taken care of if you want to change one little thing, and it's a major hassle.  If anybody out there knows of a better blog, let me know - I'm ready to dump this one.

       21 seconds   I'm 21 seconds away from the magic number.  My goal for my first mile is 8 minutes.  This is accomplished with an average speed of 7.5 miles per hour.  Since I'm only running 3/4 of a mile, I have to run this distance in 6 minutes.  My time tonight was 6:21.  It was a bit rough pushing myself that fast, but I've been steadily increasing since I first started measuring myself.  May 25 my time was 7:31, and this past Tuesday it was 6:37.  I've cut 1:10 from my time in 10 days, and 0:16 in the past two.  Once I can consistently (two consecutive weeks) run my 1.5 mile circuit in 12 minutes, I'm going to add wrist and ankle weights and hold there for a few months and see what happens.

What do I have to do To make you understand? What do I have to do To make you want me? And if I can't make you want me What do I have to do?

       Carry complications   When I got home from work last night and was undressing, my holster broke!  Those of you who know me know that I carry a concealed firearm whenever I step out of the house, and for the past year I've used a  urlLink Pager Pal  to do so, and I've loved it!  Last night the plastic pager broke at the clip, and I was most distressed.  Anyways, I check out their website and call the customer service number this morning, tell them what happened, and without question offered to send me a replacement plastic pager.   That's customer service!   If you carry concealed and haven't heard of them, check them out - It's awesome!

       Exercise, et cetera   Had a really good first run around the block tonight.  6:37 was my time.  I've never explained this, so perhaps now would be a good time.  I'm working on developing an exercise regimine for myself that will have me doing something every night - some nights less than others.  Here's my initial plan, which will most likely be revised as time goes on:  Monday night: Upper body workout Tuesday night: Jogging (1.5 miles, or twice around my block) Wednesday night: Lower body workout Thursday night: Jogging (.75 miles) Friday night: Upper body workout Saturday night: Jogging (1.5 miles) Sunday night: Jogging (.75 miles)  I'm not doing the workouts yet, because we don't have the Bowflex set up yet after our move back to Alabama.  As soon as it gets setup, which I expect will be in the next two weeks or so, I'll get my individual exercises listed, along with weight, sets, and reps.  Heck, I may move all of this to another blog eventually.

       Something WICked this way comes   I hate WIC.  Any of you who get it, or who work in a grocery store or the like are no doubt familiar with the government program,  W omen,  I nfants, and  C hildren.  It's another government handout program that steals money from the working class and hands it over to a special interest group.  It's feminist bull**** in that it doesn't give a rat's rear end about men, but why should I be surprized here?  The socialist scum that think up these ideas are more interested in appealing to enough special interest groups to get the votes they need than they are in  representing their constituents  like they  should  be doing.  Women's rights activists are speechless with joy, as are children's rights activists, and of course the women and children on the government dole don't want it to go away, so why should they vote for politicians who are honest and concerned about the population as a whole instead of their personal agendas?  On top of that, they give WIC to illegals, which only adds more of a strain to the working class.  Take our money and give it to some wetback who's only job in life is to pop out babies so mom and and dad can stay in the country, take our jobs, and export our money to that worthless pit along our southern border.  If Mexico wants a prosperous nation based on capitalism, let them make it for themselves - I say we round up every single one of these illegal scum and ship 'em back to their homeland.  Screw the "born on US soil" clause, ship their brats back across with them.  If mommy and daddy are illegal, the kids are illegal, too.  And when you ship 'em back, shoot the first one that turns around and tries to come back as a message to the rest...   We don't want you here.   And women like today's Tard of the Day should be publicly humiliated.  This feminazi actually had the gall to blame her husband  in front of him and all creation  for the cut her daughter got on her foot.  It seems the daughter ran outside barefoot and cut her foot on a piece of glass.  Since dad was the one home at the time, she blamed the incident on him.   That was the reason she gave.   Listen, feminist tards, teach your kids not to play with glass, and not to run outside barefoot, and stop blaming your husbands because  YOU  didn't take the time to teach your child what she can and cannot do.  You don't stand over your child 24/7 to ensure they don't get hurt, and to blame the father for not doing so is abominably hipocritical.

      It's an odd feeling having to call the police to have someone arrested for shoplifting.  It did not make me feel good in my heart, especially when the other employees are laughing about it, excited that we "got one".  I wasn't sure why I didn't feel good about it... after all, thieves in the store are a problem for everyone, right?  As much as I have always thought that I thirst for righteousness, I always imagined that the day I had to call the police to arrest a shoplifter would be one of those days where I spent the rest of the day with my shoulders rigid, and my head held high, for I had done what was good in the sight of my employer.  And then it hit me.  Love does not rejoice in iniquity.  But for crying out loud, risking prosecution for 11.23$ worth of stuff...  and to top it off, I'm probably going to have to show up in court to testify.  But anyways, onto lighter topics.  It was extremely flattering, though mildly upsetting, to be seriously propositioned for sex by a woman at work tonight.  She's an employee at the store, and while she has made passes at me before and I have told her very plainly "no" in the past to those advances, tonight she actually suggested that she and I should  do the deed  sometime.  When I told her that wasn't going to happen, she forced a laugh and stated that she was only kidding, but I'm sure all of you have heard  that  tone in someone's voice when they said they were only kidding about something.  She is a troubled individual, and is not living in a stable marriage, nor is her family stable, by any stretch of the imagination, and I have tried to be a friend while simultaneously distancing myself from her emotionally... not playing her little flirting games, redoubling my efforts at whatever paperwork I happen to be working on when she comes up to talk to me, so on and so forth, but I do have sympathy for her, and I wish I had the words to tell her how to make everything better in her life.  Finally, I went ahead and used the July coupon from the Movie Gallery calender that Diamond and I bought at the end of last year.  I picked up 'K-19, The Widowmaker' and 'Phone Booth'.  I'm really getting lonely... renting movies you know you're only going to watch by yourself is kind of depressing.

      A bit of good news, I think.  I believe I have identified the source of my poor interpersonal skills.  My father was in the Navy for 21 years.  By the time I was born, he had already served for 13 years, meaning that he entered the Navy in 1965.  Until I was 5 years old, my dad wasn't around.  He was a crewman aboard submarines, and would spend three months at sea, followed by a week or a weekend at home.  My first memory of my father isn't one of being carried up the stairs to bed, or being spun around while we played... no... my first memory of my father was fear.  He was coming home from one of his stints at sea, and my mother and I had gone to pick him up.  My mother and I were standing outside, and she points to him and tells me "There's daddy!" to which, without really looking, I begin to run towards him as he descends some stone steps.  Now, I had apparently had enough contact with my father to recognize his face, because when I saw him and his  bearded  face, I did not recognize him as he lumbered towards me, reaching for me, I ran away in what I remember as being sheer terror.  I think I was three, maybe four.  When I was four and five years old, my mother and I lived in government housing in Washington state.  I went to preschool there, and even though the community playground was in  my  backyard (I thought that was the absolute coolest thing in the world.. my back yard was a  huge  playground, with swings, teeter-totters, a merry-go-round, those odd horse-things mounted on giant coil springs... you name it, we had it, all in a giant sandbox), but even though I had such a huge kid-magnet, the lack of children my age meant I played out there alone.  Apparently mom didn't have any friends with kids.  Preschool was one thing, but that was only an hour or two a day.  I did spend about a week in daycare; I think my mom did that to try and socialize me a bit more, but the ladies that ran the daycare were horrible.  They sat me in the corner once because I didn't like peas, and wouldn't eat the ones they fed to us.  They had a bunch of the red cardboard bricks you could use to build simple stuff with, and that was probably my favourite toy there, but the other kids got preferential treatment, and whenever I wanted to build something other than what they wanted to build,  I  was the one scolded and told to share.  I complained to mom until she pulled me out of it, but she never really believed my stories of how horrible the place was.  When I was about five and a half, dad got out of submarine duty, and spent the next three years as a recruiter, which required a move to Georgia.  They found a house in Leesburg, Georgia, which was an hour's drive from Americus, Georgia, where my dad worked.  As such, dad was very much gone when I woke up in the mornings, and usually wouldn't get home until somewhere between 6 and 7:30, leaving no more than two hours of time with me before I had to go to bed, even though in those days I would lie in bed for four or five hours before falling asleep.  He was home on the weekends sometimes, and we did some things together, though the only thing I remember doing with him was building a small playhouse, elevated about six feet off the ground.  The lack of contact with my dad was all well and good, but arguments with either of my parents always involved my dad's military mentality.   You will do  what  I say,  when  I say it, no questions asked,  because I said so.   Do you understand me?     Any sigh, any looking down, really, anything other than undivided attention and a "yes  sir " was punished, usually with a slap on the thigh and a "Look at me when I'm talking to you" or "Answer me".  My parents' word always carried the weight of law, and I was in no position to question - I was expected to obey without delay, because "I'm the boss, you do as I say."  When I was 8, we moved from Georgia to Virginia.. back to my parents' hometown of Martinsville.  We had a nice house, and a huge yard - something like 9/10 of an acre.  Dad mowed it sometimes, but it usually fell on me to mow after I turned 12, and it was always expected that I do the entire yard in a single day.  There was one time I recall that my friends were outside playing.  I could see them, and hear them out on the road above the roar of the push mower we used.  I asked, and mom let me wait and finish the back yard the next day... until dad got home and it was demanded that I finish the rest of the yard that evening.  I forget how old I was, but my parents had friends, I think from my time spent in little league, with a son about my age.  I picked up a certain colorful word from this lad, not knowing the significance of this nugget.  One time after a game, or practice, I forget which, we were in the parking lot of my elementary school, and I was in the back of my dad's silver pickup, and this particular lad was going somewhere, and I invited him up into the back of the truck for some purpose.  When he declined, I taunted him, telling him to "Get up here you stupid  fill-in-the-blank !"  My father was not five feet from me, and even if a "good" young boy is prone to use such language, no one in his right mind uses such language in front of his parents.  He immediately snapped, "  What  did you just say? "  I knew I had done wrong, but I didn't know what, and so I repeated the entire exclamation,  that word  and all.  I spent the next half hour, in the parking lot, the drive home, and about 15 minutes spent outside the house once we got home, being berated about how I am not to use such language, trying to tell them that I didn't know it was bad, and I'm sorry, I won't do it again, and being told "It doesn't matter if you didn't know it was bad, if you had a question about whether it was bad or not, you should have asked."  There was another time I remember being absolutely devastated, unable to breathe for the tears, driven to the point of mindlessly repeating "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry" while my parents laid into me for something.. I don't even remember what now.. being cornered and forced to sit in the den while they yelled at me, prohibited from running away, my apologies falling on deaf ears, my crying ignored... I didn't know what they wanted, all I know is I wanted to run as far away from their yelling and their disregard for how I was feeling, but being essentially chained to the floor and unable to escape.  I've never been close at all with my dad's side of the family.  We'd sometimes spend Christmas with his sister in Roanoke, VA, but I never really felt welcome, and without kids my own age there, I'd spend the time playing in the woods outside their  awesome  log cabin up in the woods.  They  lived  in a log cabin!  Two stories, plus a basement, it was huge, and it was cool.. you could see the logs on the inside of the house, planed flat and polished in some places, bare round log in others, a huge cathedral ceiling in the living room... man, I loved that house!  But I spent all my time there playing in the woods, or with toys by myself in whatever corner of the house I could find away from everybody else.  Aside from my dad's youngest sibling and his two kids, both too young for me to play with, and my grandmother, I've never seen any of my dad's side of my family after his funeral... and even at his funeral, only two of his siblings were in attendance, and one (whom I have neither seen nor heard from since) saw me, looked me dead in the eyes...  and never said a word  at the funeral.  After dad passed away, the arguments between mom and I deteriorated.  There was a time we were arguing about... something, again, the trigger escapes me, but I was leaning in the doorway to her bedroom, my feet crossed in one corner, and my shoulder leaning against the opposite side, my arms crossed.  Mom decided she was through in her bedroom, folding clothes or something, and came at me, slammed an arm into me, and I flailed as I went down... I grabbed her arm or something, but I was already going down... her bedroom was adjacent to mine, the doorways facing each other, and as I had hold of her arm, falling into my bedroom, she fell and hit the wall next to my doorway, giving her a hairline fracture in her nose.  To this day she blames me for it, accusing me of intentionally slamming her into the wall, despite the fact that I bruised my arm as I clipped the doorjam on my way down, and cracked my head hard against the floor.  When mom would make a point I couldn't argue against, or accuse me of something I could not defend against, she would zero in on it and pick at me with it.  " Huh?  Answer me, huh?  What was it?  Why can't you answer me, huh?   Because it's your fault and you know it , don't you?  Huh?  Yeah, that's what I thought. "  Looking now at how I've dealt with people, I can say with some hope that I  learned  how to interact with people from my parents and family, and I look with optimism towards  re learning how to  properly  deal with people, both in everyday conversation, and in conflict.  It is at this point that I ask my wife and her family to contact me in regards to the rest of this post... I will email it to you - it's for your eyes only.

      A couple weeks ago, I ran across the link you'll find at the bottom of this post.  I sent it to Diamond, who upon reading it exclaimed, "Did this guy write about  you ?!"  The application of dating aside, there are a lot of tidbits in this article that really do apply to me, and probably to a lot of other intelligent men out there in the world.  Even if you're not dating, and even if you're Forrest Gump, I'd recommend reading it - lots of good info, ya know?  In any case, while I recognized that a lot of this applied to me, I didn't realize just  how  it applied to me... kind of like reading an article on how fuel pumps in a car work, but not knowing how that information applied to my car, since (most likely) every manufacturer out there uses a different fuel pump.  I dunno.. I'm rambling here... anyways...  Over the past 11 days I've had to do a lot of self-examination in an effort to restore my marriage.  I've come to a point where I am restoring my faith in God, and where I'm spending time talking with pastors and elders in the church who I would otherwise not spend time with.  As one particular pastor who is very highly regarded in the eyes of many told me today, though, it may be that the effort to restore my marriage is what brought me back to God, and while if that were the case, it wouldn't exactly be the best reason, God can still make use of my efforts, and I feel He is doing so.  I read recently "How to Stop the Pain" by Dr. James B. Richards - I don't care who you are, go  read  this book.  I've also spent a lot of time reading Job, Matthew, Romans, and 1 Corinthians... too many chapters in each book to list, really.  I've spent a lot of time praying about what I've read, and asking God to work in my heart and in my mind, and lo, I present to you the revelation(s?) that have come to my mind.  I used to teach theology online.  I say theology as opposed to Christianity, because I learned much about Catholicism, Mormonism, a couple pagan religions, Islam, as well as Christianity.  I learned about these other religions for one specific purpose - to tear them apart from the inside out.  I learned about them  to be destructive with the knowledge I acquired .  With this knowledge at hand, I ventured forth into chat rooms night after night to wage war against the adherents of these aberrations.  My strategy was simple, yet cunning and elegant - if you can tear down these people's beliefs, destroy their faith, you will create a void in their life, at which point you fill that void with the word of God.  It was an extremely destructive tactic, and it  didn't ever work .  Now, I never stopped to question why it didn't work... I  knew  why it didn't work.   People are stupid  and if they won't accept proof from their own texts and tenets, then they are just  blind and stupid  and can't be taught, and are doomed to destruction... no two ways about it.  The lack of success pushed me away from teaching... after all, what was the point if no one would listen to me?  Yeah, I was  that  stupid.  I can't imagine the pain I caused in some of these people's lives, how destructive I was not to just their faith in their own religion, but possibly even destructive to their faith in God as well.  Christ taught us in the parable of the tares  not  to go in and try to tear out the seeds of evil that our opponent has planted, but I always assumed that passage was only talking about  people  and how we weren't to wage holy wars like Islam does in an effort to eradicate the tares.  But come to think of it, I can imagine the pain I caused people... because in retrospect, I dealt with people in conflict this way  everywhere , not just in theological matters.  When I say "people everywhere" I mean  everywhere .  My wife included.  I've spent the better part of six and a half years tearing her down, thinking that I was building her up, better than she was... and I have very nearly destroyed both her and my marriage in the process.  Listen up, kiddies - the voice of experience is about to speak.   Even when you  know  you are right, never, never, never try to brow-beat your correctness into anyone else .  Never is a strong word, and there may be exceptions, but I'm learning the Rules of Engagement right now, and like any learning process, you learn the rules first, and the exceptions later.   Never let yourself demand to be right all the time, never try to tear down your opponent if you think you are right.   Psychologists create an environment in which a patient can talk through their problems and realize their problems for themselves.  If they are told their problem, they usually will not respond because  they don't see their problem for themselves .  Some things you just have to learn on your own, and an environment dominated by  love  is conducive to this sort of learning.  One dominated by accusations, blame, and a destructive, arrogant spirit are not.  People in all walks of life are reluctant to admit wrongdoing for a couple of reasons.  First, nobody  wants  to be wrong!  Being right is better than being wrong, because being right allows you to progress.  Being wrong is just a dead end, often with unfavourable consequences.  Second, people avoid admitting wrong because  people feed on the failures of others .  Look in your newspaper, watch the evening news... our world is in a deluge of  bad news .  Cancer rates are up, the president lied about such and such, Martha Stewart is going to jail, Michael Jackson is in another lawsuit... bad news, bad news, bad news, bad news... we thrive on it, we gossip about it, we point fingers at those who fail and stumble and fall.   We derive entertainment from the shortcomings of others .  Without a loving environment, if we go and confess a sin or a wrong to people, those people decend upon us like vultures.  I've been a fool...   Wake up, people!   Allow for an environment in which wrongs can be  acknowledged  and  forgiven  and then  deal with the consequences , and you'll find you have much better relationships with people.  Dealing with other people's problems in a loving manner like this is always better than trying to  tear them apart to prove them wrong  so you can "fix" them.  This may all be elementary to you, and if so, count yourself blessed... dealing with the consequences of my own error, my own royal snafu, have been absolute hell.  But I'm dealing with it.  I am a tree.  My marriage is one particular fruit on that tree that is about to fall off for lack of proper nourishment.  I have to deal with my own root problems that are the source of poor nourishment for  all of my fruit .  If you've been praying for my marriage, I ask now that you redirect your prayers to me, and my coping with the root of my problems.  If you aren't praying yet, please start, again directing them to me and my self-improvement.

       Moving on   Those of you who haven't seen SpiderMan 2,  what's wrong with you?   Really, this movie truly is the best movie I've seen in a long time.  There are no words to describe it.. it's just that fantastically awesomely stupendously excellent.  Break your piggy bank, rob a couple kids of their lunch money, beat up an old woman at the grocery store checkout.. just take your money and  go see this movie .  I promise, you won't regret it.  Assuming, of course, you have any taste in movies!

      "Jesus EXPANDED the definition of adultery from a squishy physical act to one springing from the heart and mind."  I recognize this.. I never stated otherwise.. but He did not change the definition of what constitutes adultery - a woman having sex with a man other than her husband.  Paul understood this, and I've already illustrated this in his letters to the Corinthians.  "It appears from your posts that you have arrived at the conclusion that a married man cannot commit adultery (other than with another man's wife)."  Correct.  There is no scriptural basis for any other conclusion.  "Tell me. Has God thus created women to be the mere sex-slaves of married men?"  No, no more than the church is the mere sex-slave of God.  As God is the head of the church, so is the husband the head of the household.  Yes, people have sex in marriage.  No, that's not what marriage is all about.  "One man. One woman. You can argue with us, and cut-and-paste 'til the cows come home, but the ultimate argument will be with Jesus Christ on the last day."  Well, since Jesus Christ (God) explicitly formed and blessed polygamous households, I know there won't be any problems in that realm of my life.  God says polygamy is ok.. again, He  caused  it, He  blessed  it, and He  never spoke against it  nor did any of the apostles in their laundry lists of sins.  We have chosen whom we will heed in this matter.  My question for you is,  why do you keep ignoring the fact that God did these things with polygamous families, and still concentrate on the same flimsy arguments which contradict  the actions and the words of God ?   Why do you insist on saying that God's design was monogamous marriage  when God Himself caused and blessed polygamous marriages?   If what you say is true, God is a liar, and contradicted Himself on numerous occasions!  Everything else aside, the examples which I have provided of God causing, governing, and blessing polygamous marriages are enough by themselves to resoundingly state without  any  doubt whatsoever that  you are wrong  in stating that God's design was and is one man in union with one woman.  That which is done without faith is sin - and I have faith that if I ever enter into a polygamous relationship, God will honor it, God will be glorified by it, and my family will be blessed by it.  I've said my peace, those who will listen, have listened.  Those who can learn, will learn.  And those who will not, will not.  You may never agree with our beliefs and our decisions, but that is something we are willing to face.  We hope you will love us as we love you, despite conflicting beliefs, whether we act on them or not.

       Refuting arguments against polygamy   I am going to deal with the arguments against polygamy on a verse-by-verse basis, meaning that I’m going to try and deal with the issues based on the verses used by those who argue against it.   A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; 1 Timothy 3:2   There are two ways to interpret this verse.  The first and most obvious is that this applies only to bishops (deacons or elders in some translations and in other iterations of this particular phrasing) and it is only they who are expected to have no more than one wife.  Alternately, if we look at the Greek, the word for “one” (mia) can also be translated as “first”.  This interpretation would fit nicely with requirements for the high priesthood as set forth in Leviticus:   And he shall take a wife in her virginity. A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife. Leviticus 21:13-14   Paul could have been saying that a bishop’s wife could not have been divorced or widowed or anything of the sort.  A much less plausible translation would see “mia” as being used as an indefinite article.  While this is not unheard of (many Indo-European languages follow this pattern, including Spanish, French, German, Latin, and even Modern Greek) it would unreasonably hinder the office, preventing anyone who had lost a wife for any reason (including death) or who had never taken a wife (which is in keeping with Paul’s personal exhortations in 1 Corinthians 7) from holding the office.  In any case, no reasonable interpretation of this passage prohibits polygamy by anyone except bishops, leaving apostles, prophets, teachers, helpers, administrators, and laymen free to take multiple wives.   Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. Genesis 2:24   This and all iterations of this wording are often used to try and prove that God’s intent was that a man “cleave unto” his wife – the absence of “wives” is assumed to be proof that polygamy was never God’s intent, but this interpretation flies in the face of all the men God blessed with multiple wives, and all of the blessings God poured out upon his people through multiple wives.  Additionally, if we allow for the possibility of polygamy, a man can cleave unto all of his wives, since they are all in fact truly a wife.  For instance, Abraham cleaved unto Sarah, but he also cleaved unto Hagar, and he also cleaved unto Keturah.  In substituting a name (which is singular) for “his wife” in these verses, we can see how the verse can easily be kept intact while allowing for polygamy.  Abraham did not cleave unto his Sarahs, or his Hagars, or his Keturahs.  Alternately, this verse is sometimes used to show that a man is leaving his father and mother, and the absence of a plural “mothers” is used to try and prove that the father is monogamous.  This argument does not withstand logical scrutiny, because a man can not have more than one mother.  Finally, some will try to cite the phrase “and they shall be one flesh” as proof that a man can not have more than one wife, since the man is “one flesh” with his wife, and can not divide himself among multiple wives and be one flesh with all of them simultaneously.  Now, this phrase is speaking only of sex.  It does not say “one soul” or “one spirit” which might have some effect at deterring polygamy (though even in that case, polygamists could cite the triune nature of God as proof that three or more souls or spirits could reside as one), but only “one flesh”.  Much like a man only being able to have one mother, a man can only have sexual intercourse with one woman at a time.  Continuing with Abraham as an example, while he was one with Sarah, he could not simultaneously be one with Hagar or Keturah, yet he could be one with them individually.  In short, verses such as Genesis 2:24 can not logically prohibit polygamy.   Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. Deuteronomy 17:17   This is specifically referring to kings of Israel after the Exodus.  This regulation had obviously been lifted by the time of David, whom God specifically blessed with multiple wives, and, as we have already seen, was willing to bless with more wives.  Thank you for reading this series of articles.  I'm going to take the time to refine it a bit and flesh it out before posting it in its entirety to the theology section of my website.  When that is done, I will of course let you all know.  Until then, if you have any  questions  for me (accusations and the like will most likely be ignored) feel free to fire away.  Many have raised legal questions in regards to United States law today, and this is something I'm still working through myself.  When I feel like I  know  something, I'll post something.

       Adultery & Fornication   The words “adultery” and “fornication” are both used multiple times throughout scripture, and like many words in scripture, most people assume that these words are defined by their understanding of them.  Unfortunately, this is not always the case.  The definition of adultery in Leviticus is this:   And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.  And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them. Leviticus 20:10-12   No where in scripture is adultery defined as a married man having sex with an unmarried woman, yet this is included in the definition commonly taught today.  Thus, accusations of adultery are (incorrectly) thrown at men who practice polygyny.   And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife. 1 Corinthians 7:10-11   Note that God’s command is only towards women to remain unmarried.  Since divorce is not honored by God, if the woman leaves and remarries, she is committing adultery.  There is no such command to remain unmarried for the men, yet the modern church teaches that he is to remain unmarried also, because otherwise it is taught that he is committing adultery, yet this doctrine is not found in scripture.  In short, a woman commits adultery if she is married and lies with a man other than her husband.  A man only commits adultery if he lies with another man’s wife.  Fornication, on the other hand, is a sexual relationship between any two unmarried or unespoused individuals.  Espousals in scripture are the same as being engaged to another person – they are a promise to wed, the same thing as a betrothal.   "And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? Let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it. And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? Let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her." - Deuteronomy 20:6-7   Consider also that all of the polygamous men in scripture were blessed with their wives, and through their wives.  David indeed committed adultery, but not with his multitude of wives, but with Bathsheba, who was married to Uriah.  Consider that there is no great commandment against fornication, but instead we find this:   And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. 17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins. Exodus 22:16-17   If a man fornicates with an unbetrothed (unengaged) virgin, he is required to marry her, or if the father will not allow the union, the man is required to pay the dowry as though he were going to marry her.  In Deuteronomy 20 we saw that it was not fornication for a man to lay with his fiancé, yet here in Exodus 22, it is presented as wrong for a man to lay with a woman who is not betrothed to anyone.  Again, betrothal is an intent to marry – when sex takes place outside of this, it is fornication.  We must also note that throughout scripture, there is no condemnation of polygamy, there is no prohibition against the taking of multiple wives, and as we have already seen, God has blessed men with those multiple wives, and in some cases is even willing to give more wives to certain men.  In the lists of sins that bar one from heaven, those who take multiple wives are not mentioned whatsoever.  Moreover, God’s ordinances for us were worded so as to create polygamous marriages.   If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her. Deuteronomy 25:5   No exception is made if the living brother is already married – if the surviving brother were already married, this law would have compelled him to become polygamous.  God’s laws also governed how polygamous households were to receive multiple wives.   If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish. Exodus 21:10   God governs polygamy, causes and blesses with polygamy, which is not considered by God to be adultery or fornication.  Tomorrow: Refuting arguments against polygamy

       God as a polygynous entity   God is presented and presents Himself as polygamous throughout scripture.   The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity. And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister:  and they were mine , and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah. Ezekiel 23:1-4  Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although  I was an husband unto them , saith the LORD: Jeremiah 31:31-32   Jesus presents Himself as being ready to marry ten wives, but only marries five in the parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25.  Paul identifies God as being polygamous in his letter to the church at Corinth:   For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ 2 Corinthians 11:2   Note that the three instances of “you” in this passage are all “umas” – the plural of “umeis”.  In symbolism, Jesus Christ is identified as both a lion and a lamb, both of which are polygamous in that there is generally one male to the pride or flock of females.   And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. Revelation 5:5-6   With God as our ultimate example of how to live, with His endorsement and blessings upon polygamous households seen yesterday, how can we say that polygamy is or ever was wrong?

       Practitioners of polygyny in scripture   Polygyny, or the taking of multiple wives by a singular husband, is a practice firmly established by righteous men in scripture, and even encouraged and caused by God Himself.  David, king of Israel, had multiple wives.   And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things. 2 Samuel 12:7-8   God gave David the wives of Saul, on top of the wives David already had.  David's sin was not in taking multiple wives, but in committing adultery with Bathsheba, and having Uriah murdered in battle to conceal his sin.  And look at what God told David… had his house, his wives, and his kingdom not been enough, God was prepared to give David more of all of these things!  This includes more wives!  Jacob, later named Israel, had two wives and two concubines.   Read Genesis 29 and 30.  Wives were Leah and Rachel, concubines were Bilhah and Zilpah.   From this man and his four women came the twelve tribes of Israel.  God specifically blessed Jacob through all of his women.  Abraham had three wives – everyone knows Sarah, but children are not taught about Abraham's wives Hagar and Keturah.   And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. Genesis 16:3  Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. Genesis 25:1   Abraham was a righteous man in the eyes of God, and God never rebuked him for these wives, and even blessed him through the offspring of these marriages.  Moses, the man God chose to lead His people out of Egypt, was blessed with two wives.   And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. Exodus 2:21  And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman. Number 12:1   Zipporah was from Midian, not Ethiopia, and was taken as Moses's wife before the exodus, while Moses was in hiding from Pharaoh.  Additionally, Miriam and Aaron were punished for speaking out against Moses because of his second (Ethiopian) wife.  Solomon is probably the most famous polygamist in scripture, having 700 wives and 300 concubines.   And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father. 1 Kings 11:3   Solomon’s fall is never described as his taking of so many wives, but in following after the gods of these foreign women.  There are other examples, but these five should suffice to prove that:   Polygamy is not pagan   Polygamy is endorsed and provided for by God   Polygamy was practiced by righteous men  Tomorrow: God as a polygynous entity

      Well, now, for all of you who might be interested in my movie selections, I warn you now that "Phone Booth" is rather... bland.  For those of you with sensitive ears, I emphatically suggest you wait for the network presentation, which will no doubt prove as hilarious as old Chinese ninja movies in which none of the audible dialect matches the movements of the characters' mouths.  Hopefully, though, it won't be as bad as the second-and-a-half delay between some guy wringing his lips and some two bit voice over warning everyone to look out for "Go'zirra" (Godzilla to the uninitiated).  K-19 was much better.  You really can't go wrong with Harrison Ford  or  Liam Neeson.  I've found that I've really come to enjoy sub movies, probably because of my proximity to them in years past.  I forget which one it was, but I had the opportunity to board a submarine that my dad had served on when I was a kid.  I remember going around in the galley - where  everything  was painted white... a blindingly bright white - and dad telling me about men who only realized their claustrophobia once at sea, gripping the poles so tightly their knuckles turned as white as the table.  I want to visit one again, just to, ya know?  Anyways, if you like military movies, K-19 will probably disappoint you.  There's no tension between sides -  heck, you never get a word from the Americans.  This isn't a war movie, really, so if you're looking with something that has an interesting story line, do yourself a favour and go rent "The Hunt for Red October" again.  If, on the other hand, you enjoy theatrical history, or just sub movies in general, K-19 is worth your time.  In other news, I went to Huntsville today.  My day off, it's been a couple weeks, hey, why not.  I didn't do much.. spent maybe an hour and a half.  I got to enjoy Sakkio again, as it's been nearly a month... Teriaki chicken...  mmmmmmmmmm .  Piddled around Software, ETC., and didn't see a single copy of Doom 3 anywhere.  A couple of not so interesting games that I don't remember the titles to, lame toys at Kay-Bee, but I did spend some time in Waldenbooks.  A couple of titles I'd be interested in having, but instead of buying there, I went to the Family Christian Bookstore next to the Wal-Mart and picked up "Biblical Leadership" by Ken Collier and Matt Williams, as well as "Love Must Be Tough: New Hope for Marriages in Crisis" by Dr. James Dobson.  Flipping through it, it looks superb, but I started "Biblical Leadership" first, which so far is teaching leadership by being a servant - just like Christ.  It's good, and I pray the Spirit rewrites a bit more on my heart with it.
