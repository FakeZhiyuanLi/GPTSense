        I hate&nbsp;thiefs!!&nbsp;A freaking thief broke in my appartement yesterday and stole :2 speakers, DVD , money and everything like that.        &nbsp;   A lady that lives on the 2nd floor, actually saw the guy steeling ... She said: I saw a guy aged from 20 to 25 on a black bike with red stuff on it, riding in front of my apt from 3:30 to 4:00pm&nbsp;back and forth, back and forth, then she saw him going between the apt and the neighbour's house. When he came back, she saw him with a super big bag in his hands.  &nbsp;  She&nbsp; didn't know that he was steeling. but when we asked the manager fix the forced window the lady knew that the guy stole stuff...       &nbsp;   Then the lady described the guy to the manager. And he kinda suspected a guy that lived in his apartement.The manager asked her if she would reconise him if she sees him and she said yes       &nbsp;   the manager asked the guy to do little jobs at the same time the lady had the opportunity to see if it was him.When she said it was him, we called the police they came they checked my house and found some digital fingerprints        &nbsp;   Now we have to wait for the"detectives"comes to check out if the prints are his...And that's also why I'm pissed 'cause we still have to wait for at least2 days!!!!!&nbsp;

        This sucks....The police didn't call yet....          Today, we got to the police station. And we asked them when are the "detectives" are gonna call.And they said that we had to be patient and give them some more time.And guess in how many days they're MAYBE gonna call? 1 WEEK!!! Then he gaves us a paper for us to write what we lost, after that my mom ripped the paper in front of his face!!!Just joking...And we got to chinatown...(and ate of course)
