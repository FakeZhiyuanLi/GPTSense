      No, fictional reader my room did no get blown up. We took a few casualties but they'll be OK. Most of them didn't end up needing to go to the hospital so that's good. I'm very tired. It's been another long and draining day, still not yeilding a paper on the ancient world. It's nearly finished and in my opinion very good. I wish I had someone I trust to take a look at it before I submit it.   I really wish I would have coppied my broadway CD's and taken them with me.

      Ok, so God does answer prayers. No work tonight. My paper is coming along swimmingly. More mortars, yay. I hope my room didn't get blown up. I should go check. Talk to you later.

      It's true, fictional reader still no fucking rest. I think the  Blackhawk-Six  has it in for  Outlaw-Six  . They've been running us ragged for like 28 hours and counting. I'm so dirty and tired, but strangly enough have the energy to come here and work on my paper. I should be done by 8am east coast time tomorrow, a day early to boot.   We had an interesting conversation at work about the girls of GI Joe and just what sort of underwear they sported. We all agreed The Baroness had sexy undies. I think Lady J wears really frumpy undies. We couldn't come to an agreement about Scarlet. I'm sure I'll come up with something. I hope dinner chow doesn't suck. I'm so fucking hungry. Yay mortars ! Gotta go.

      I'm so tired. It's been a long night/morning at work and we're just back for a few hours before we have to work again. Last night was ok, we got what we came for just kinda a little more coarsely then I care for. I didn't think about her too much, which is pretty commonplace on long nights like the last one. Please, don't get me wring fictional reader, I'm not over her. I'm pretty sure I'll never be over her. Breakfast was adiquate. I snapped at soldier who was rude to me last night. Quite asertive, if I don't say so.   I've been considering gay marriage lately. Not my own of course, silly. But the concept in general I was at one time staunchly opposed to. Why? Maybe because I was told be, maybe because I felt obligated to oppose it for some reason. But I don't. How can we pass a law that targets and specifically excludes a demographic. We can't. Maybe I'm not so right wing after all. Conservative, just not ulta. I babble once again. I can't wait to finish off this paper.   My order from Amazon.com is on it's way I can't wait. It's  Liberty ! on DVD, I loved that documentary. It took letters from the period and had actors perform them. Very dramatic, I must say. I also got another copy of SP. Why would I do that you might ask, simple. This version is the encore recording with new singers and a new song, so fuck off. Georgetown Press also released a new Iraqi Arabic course with a solid dictionary and MP3 recordings. It's so hard the get the local accent down without listening. I also want the  Master and Commander  soundtrack and  Shrek 2 . Italics are cool, no?

      It's been a week since I spoke with her. As I told you fictional reader she sent me the link to her site. No, you cannot see it. It's bad enough all her friends read about what I an asshole I am, I don't need you reading it either. Bah, who are you going to tell anyway. She sick, so she writes. Wish I could help somehow, but I don't think that's possible anyway. I can't be there all the time to help her. Not like she'd accept it anyway. Would she ?   I wrote to Kate today, I sounded like such an idiot. No, I'm not back from work, but I did have a few spare minutes so I took a walk up to the 1/37 MWR to check my mail. Surprise: No mail. Oh shit, I forgot to tell you. I have yahoo personal. Isn't that pathetic? Not only have I become a heart-on-my-sleeve net author, I also have a personal. The picture is older, I'm about 35 pounds heavier but I'm sure the future ex-Mrs. Andrews should get the idea.  I'm sure I'll be here to write more after work. Oh ? Maybe someone responded to my ad. Doubtful, but possible. Catch you later.

      It's been pretty easy going today, but I'll have to work later on tonight. Oh well. I had a terrible dream about Kate last night. It was very disturbing. I'm happy she's not over here, one less trooper for me to worry about. She's fine in England, she's deploying some place cushy for a time, which should be good for her. Still have to write her and her mother back. I'm so bad about that sort of thing.  I know dear reader that last night's post was a bit depressing, but really I can draw no other conclusion on the matter. Maybe she never loved me the way I love her. It hurts to keep thinking about this, but I can't stop. *sigh* I still have to finish up this paper. It's due in a few days. My teacher says I can have an extension whenever I need it, which if these new rumors are true I most certainly may need. I should go. Write more after work.

      Today was not much different from yesterday. I've been thinking about her non-stop. Rea is here from  COP: Blickenstaff  for some repairs and we've just spent the time reminiscing. He was there the night I broke it off with her. What a fucking mistake, wouldn't you say fictional reader?  I've been reading her blogg from time to time. The archives are especially skewed. If you've never been embarrassed in a public forum before, please take it from me; it is not pleasant. To be hurt so many times in as many minutes pained me to the core. Hard as it was, I'd need to be a fool to carry on. I've lost her. The truth hurts the most.  It dawned on me as I read that I was never enough for her. That I could never be enough for her. That I, in my best condition could only ever offer her a small life. I always thought love would be enough to carry the day. Her lies and manipulations were only a side effect of the truth that is so painful to me: I'm not good enough. Maybe someday to someone, but not now. It hurts so much.  I know we agreed to keep the Adrienne-talk to a minimum, fictional reader but this I had to say. I'm sure they'll be more. I'm sorry if I bore you. On to things more pleasant. Hm, lets see.  " Girl With A Pearl Earring "  was wonderful, however more anticlimactic that I would have hoped for. Wilkenson was ghastly, while I was still unmoved by Firth. Scarlet Johanssen is heavenly as Griet with an excellent performance in her own right.  Shrek 2  was great and  Jersey Girl  might be Smith's best work yet. We'll discuss that at a latter time.  Aside from work and her, what else is there really to talk about? Tomorrow I need to write back to Kate before she deploys, she's been very sweet to me despite the constant mopping around I do. This paper is coming very slow. I wish I had a laptop. Well I should stop babbling and call it a night.

      Having deleted my old blogg and kept the same format I've decided to start over again. The last one as you may of well known, fictional reader was devoted to pining over Adrienne. As I'm sure this will undoubtedly happen again from time to time, lets not make it the focus here. I'm sure even  you   tire of hearing about her. It's hard since she's been gone not having anyone with a brain to talk to. Most of the conversation here is relinquished to the following:  1. Sports 2. Cars 3. Fighting 4. Movies (sub-par) 5. Crass dick-and-fart jokes  Christ, it never ends. My peers are mostly idiots devoid of passion and direction. While I don't feel sympathy for them. I do feel very isolated most of the time. I've been trying to get though my bootleg copy of  "Girl With A Pearl Earring"  I like it thus far. Tom Wilkinson is great like always. I just can't get over Colin Firth with that fucking ridiculous wig of his. Scarlet Johanssen is beautiful but a bit too restrained, I feel. I'll have watch some more for a better assessment. Who cares anyway?  On a sad note I brought my new wrist GPS out on the trail with me. I've been at least a half mile off this whole time. It's so upsetting. Now granted the GPS only tracks on a map taking no account of terrain or elevation changes. Still. 5.5 miles is not six. *sigh* My weight(190,-30 pounds) is coming along well and I'm quickly approaching the best shape of my life. I'm waiting till my next PT test(275 last test) to annouce my intentions to leave for SFAS. I'll need a 290+ PT score and a good tape test to show I'm serious. I'll find out in two weeks.  These people on AOL are very slow. Where are the good women? I suppose they are out studying and achieving,not rotting away online, which is why I'm off. I've been neglecting this paper on the Ancient Hebrews for like a week now. If we do end leaving  FOB Marez , this class could get difficult. It's not good to listen too much to the runor mill. Hm, what else. Haji jumped us while we were out on patrol. RPG attack, no one hurt. DK didn't even fire back, fucker. Get 'em next time. Oh well,Thanks for listening.

      I haven't much to talk about today, dear reader. It's a hot day on  COP:Blickenstaff  where we make our home for the next few days. There is little to do here but sleep, bake in the sun, and of course wait for Haji to rear his ugly head. I love to dream of her, it's the source of my best sleep.

      I feel as if I would like to punch Michael Moore in the nose, fictional reader. That could, however be his drive in life; to aggravate, for it cannot be to inform or elevate the masses to excel. Blogs are a buzz with praise for his latest motion treatise  Fahrenheit 9/11 . Unfathomable as to why, your humble author would waste his time on this topic it is worth devoting a few keystrokes to the man he so loathes.  Adrienne and I as per our occasional Sunday predilection attended a viewing of Mr.Moore's ghastly  Bowling For Columbine .  (Meriting note is the locale of said theater. The Grand is nestled in a hilly mock bohemian section of downtown Tacoma overlooking the Puget Sound).  We persevered through films subjective muckraking and of course, the directors inane and insolent conclusions as to very nature of American aggression and violence. This topic is indeed worthy of a documentary, just not one authored and under the direction of he. At the conclusion of the film it received a standing ovation. Unmoved by his trash we sunk into our chairs.  You are not a documentarist Mr. Moore. You are a malcontent with a Miramax budget. I do so pity you. It will be difficult to view his latest film on FOB: Marez for it is uncertain as to if the local Iraqi vendors will carry a bootleg copy. Ironically the purchasing of a bootleg copy of  Fahrenheit 9/11  will only further Mr.Bush's aims as it stokes and stabilizes the local economy here in Mosul.  Last night I again dreamt of her. It was the 1850's and I was a Victorian era con-man in search of a warm bed and a meal. I arrived at a small cottage and charmed my way inside out of the rain, dressed in a grey jean wool frock with white button holes and matching topstich. It was there I saw her. She was dressed in a homespun house dress with a knitted wool shawl again looking bright and beautiful. Adrienne saw though my ruse but said nothing to her mother as we both placed fresh linen on the bed I was to sleep in. When I discarded my frock and she was at ease upon spying the cross around my neck. Have I attempted to trick my way into her home my dearest fictional reader?  *sigh* That's enough out of me.

      It was a quiet night on Haji's roof over looking the banks of the Tigris. The countryside looks peaceful under NVG's and the hills glow in shades of emerald light from Allah's incandescent crescent moon. There was a time when fighting men called the night unknown but that is not so for us. The advanced technologies of modern warcraft have made such mysteries obsolete. It is difficult for a man of history to embrace these modernities. However it is by them that we make our deadly trade perfect, fictional reader.  It is a day of new sovereignty and now our brave band are guests in this nascant host nation. Home is but a tender few months away. I pray that it is the world as I have left it and that a new life might be mine for the having. There is much yet to do, so I close. Do you think she is well dear reader? One can only hope.    "Hope, he says, cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and holiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his journey; hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man."

      You've guessed it fictional reader, it's quite warm today. The year creeps inexorably by and yet another day finds me on  FOB: Marez  pecking away at this blog for two dollars an hour. While I shall not turn cartwheels and handsprings encumbered with glee, I shall also not mope about with the melancholic tendencies you know me for. Yes, today finds me emotionally neutral and pleased as such. So with little to write of, here is again a quick collection of neglected notable nothings:  1. I have stopped reading  Tender Warrior  by Stu Webber. His book has offend my views on family for the last time. It is a protestant publication so I had expected it to have a certain tenor, but the spiritual predisposition for man to rule his household as king was too much to stomach. It is a shame because there are so few books on contemporary masculine Christian though. It has just left more time for Plato.   2. My budgeting is quiet successful. My personal expensed now only number one hundred dollars a month. I am looking to purchase my first stock portfolio by the end of the year. In the end it's stability for my family that will bring the greatest joy in expense. I don't need a rancher's couch from sundance just yet. My army issue furniture will hold me over for the time being. The jetta is still going, it really just costs too much. Yes her hair is still found in it despite my best efforts to clean it.   I should get to work. I still have many things to tend to. Just thought I'd drop you a line and say hello, fictional reader. You're a good bud.

      Speedy's blood is still all over my body armor. He was shot in the face after the gunfight at Sheik Fati was long over with. I risked my own life to save this stranger. Taking him in my arms and running him to safety was the only concern, dear reader, not the friendly bullets flying in the streets. The anger and shame that we have done this to an innocent man will long stay with me after we return to our native soil. In the end the spectacular events of that deadly day will long fade from my memory, replaced in time perhaps by joyous recollections and not further savagery.   It is selfish to think of anything but duty in a battle. So it was some hours after streets had cooled that we, this veteran band found ourselves in the splendorous confines of  FOB: Freedom . While the men munched on designer fast food and  relaxed in Saddam's old sitting room, I had a few free minutes to think about her. Discarding the mistakes of these years or and the distress that came with her absence, I thought of a recent dream. It was Adrienne Cook dressed in an emerald dress looking bright and beautiful, I lent a smile and joined the boys for sodas.   Now it has become a matter of credibility, fictional reader. Can one do as he says despite all the ugliness he has seen and his longing for happy times? We are gambling with a family. Not speaking for her, there will be nothing for me upon losing, only the lessons learned in these hard years. I am a man who can be taken at my word. So it's my last roll of the dice. We will be a family or we will not. The rest I leave to time and hope. Is there anything really left to do, my dearest reader?  It is also worth nothing that I met my great-grandmother in a dream. She rejected the expectations of her wealthy family and married a penniless door-to-door shoe salesman. We have been poor ever since. She was tall,dark, and dressed in the old fashions. I gave her a letter I had written in Spanish. She was touched that I knew the language, kissed me and left. Thanks again to Kate LaSota for being my personal cheerleader, you rock, kiddo. Oh yes, dear reader; If you get a chance please try San Bernedinto lemon Iced Tea, it's to die for. Well, maybe that's a little far fetched, but it is quite good.   Speedy lived, by the way.

      It's another night of struggling to put into words just how I am feeling. So many things weigh on my mind right now that it's hard to sift through it all. I would like to tell you of yesterdays action, but finding battle quite unrewarding shall say nothing. Dumbfouded by the details of my own life, I will take a few days to collect my thoughts and then once again resume our discussions. I pray that she's safe, fictional reader, but knowing nothing now of her life I am delegated to wonder and as always, hope.

      I want to write about it all reader, but for the time being I cannot. Ethics,creditably, and Adrienne will all have to wait. I'm tired from fighting and still need to wash the blood off. Freedom is a wonderful thing, like life it should be renewed daily. I have never seen so many lives cut down before their golden years. I am once again, grateful that I am not one of them.

      She's furious, fiction reader. I cannot say that I blame her. Expecting to be hurt by this strangely, I am not. The past two days and now this the third have been great without her. The fact that she even now refuses to read this site and has closed her own causes no distress within me at all. While true I could easily find her new site one needs these little securities. Yes I was reading her blog as to why I was doing this, I cannot say. It feels great to be free of her.   I really hope this will last. In times past I've panicked after but a few days without her, so I'll have to see. While this feeling may be premature I must still note, dear reader that I both love and miss her very much. Cynical as you may be it's hard to deny that it's true. Perhaps this could be the source of my latest easiness. I've given myself the permission to stand on my own two feet alone. She said that I offered her the easy life. This is not true. There is nothing easy about the life of which I still am offering.  I do have such good friends. Kate has been very kind to me during all of this, especially last night(even while shopping for a blazer from J Crew), as has Corn-Chips. Old Man asked me today if I was still saving for a wedding. I told him that I did not know any more. Instead I am now saving for a rainy day. One can never tell when that might befall these days. Here is collection of notable nothings that I have neglected to address:  1. I'm selling the Jetta in favor of a Mini. It's pricy on parts and reminds me too much of her, so it's gotta go.   2. I should have twenty grand saved by the time this deployment it finished. I don't want to spend a penny of it.   3. Next semester I'm pushing for two classes instead of just the one. Western Heritage II, and History and Politics of Africa.  4. Dr. Mullaney has given me to the end of the semester to finish this class. I'm very grateful.  5. No I still cannot decide on a skin for the site so please bear with me. I like this latest one best.  I must also complement her on this latest idea. It was quite clever. I had templated this move at least thirty days from now and had anticipated her most probable course of action as having a third party contact me. So touche`, Adrienne, well done. It's hard to keep from indulging such appetites as her. I pray that my courage does not cool. If there is to be any hope that I gel as proper man, I must do it alone.  It was 120F on  Marez  yesterday by noon. Oh yes, in other news I've just been issued a most wonderful piece of kit, dearest reader. It's the Rhino. A handy little GPS for the CT on the go. If you have $305.00 lying around I highly recommend acquiring one. Thanks tax payers !

      'The narration crackles and pops with incendiary wit', well not for me dearest reader. It has occurred to me that Mark and Roger were bums after all and their magnum opuses came with much more ease then even my simple papers. On Broadway you labor through writer's block with song and choreography, then wala! Happy ending. Things are not so easy for us on  FOB:Marez  . While I have been granted a extension on the Greek paper I still lack the fire (Greek fire,heh) that I had hoped would come to me. School work is just that, work.  ( I wish I had brought my b-way CD's. A year without showtunes is killing me. )   You know that part in  Shakespeare in Love  when Will is so overcome by the passion of Viola that through the night he effortlessly scratches out Act I. That's what I want, fictional reader, an endless font of  drive and resource. But like so many things I am not Shakespeare or even Larson for that matter. I am Andrews, simple and far from greatness. Maybe I should acquire a quill and inkpot, maybe think that could work.  (BTW-for a character who can barely afford to drink in a tavern I doubt he would be so frivolous with his paper. Even in the late Elizabethan age, paper was still an uncommon commodity)   I want to write histories that go beyond such simple regurgitations. I want to author the definitive work on something trivial and understood by few. We should see books authored by myself on the manufacturing of Peter Tait or the sex life of James and Dolly Madison. Starting small however is the only viable course of action. So "The Polis: Greek City-State" will have to do for now. No one with respect a historian who cannot grasp the simple concepts of Western civilization after all, dear reader. So I remain, a lowly freshman.   He's a interesting fellow I might add, James Madison. As the author of the Bill of Rights and Alexander Hamilton's right hand man, Madison was the shit. He argued that factionalization would become the cornerstone of modern lasting democracy. Pruning the powerbase of any would-be domination of this new government they had hoped to create. He stood a mere five feet and one inch. I don't know of the stature of his wife, which leads me to believe they would have been an interesting couple to meet. However of all the colonial hotties Mrs. Adams still has be smitten. Better get at that paper, dear reader.

      So I was wrong, fictional reader. The many months that it has taken me to realize this has yielding nothing but misery. I should have cut and run a long time ago like everyone told me to. But smart moves aren't my forte. So I remain as loyal as my sordid capacity now allows. I'm holding onto hope. In the meantime I'm going to try and learn to be a better person. Can one actually do that?  There's nothing to do but hope I grow to be better man from all of this and maybe-just maybe have a little happiness of my own. In a quick calculation I have enjoyed only sixteen days of joy since the commencement of this deployment. That's a scant .06%. Something to think about, fictional reader. I babble on and on, so I should close. Tomorrow is Father's Day. I couldn't get in touch with pop so I left a message on his machine. Hope he's doing well. I still think I should have that "Man-Stuff" conversation that I though I had needed. Still worth having, even if it is a bit useless to me now.   I do still miss her of course, reader. I just can't drone on about it all the time. Need to get busy living. Sleep tight.

      I was sitting out on the hilltop last night trying to spot Mortar-Guy and Rocket-Man. How I hate those long dark hours on the banks of the Tigris, fictional reader. It's in those many minutes alone that I feel the lowest. She is entirely correct, despite the many pains she has caused and the many faults she possesses. Admittedly, I have been a terrible man. It has not been enough to love, she needed more then I was able to give. Her freedom meant my destruction. I guess it came down to survival. So I did really pick myself after all and am ashamed. What a woman she is, and how great the loss to lament, dearest reader.   The other night on the roof of Haji's house Corn-Chips offered some advice :  " You have to move on sergeant, it's for the best. You can't do a whole lot more. Keep in you heart and hope she comes back to you someday. "   That's all I really can do. I can auger only that my greatest fears will come true. She does not need me, she has never really needed me, and will in time forget about me. I wanted to be the father of her children by age thirty. Now I feel I will only be a relic of sad times past. You lose some, you lose some.   America is but a few months away. How I love my home:  habeebee amreeka inta bait, illhamdualla . I will have new things. Nice new clothes to fit my slimming frame. I shall have a new car and perhaps a few pieces of furniture. Yes, all these things are hollow without someone to share them with but I will make do. It's all I have the right to. I couldn't bear inflicting my character on yet another worthy woman. So I rest and prepare for selection. God forgive me for my many mistakes and heal those whom I have hurt, friend and foe alike.    " I want to do something that will surprise the world, something grand and wild, to cut a flash, to strike amazement, to catch the attention of everyone. Will it be some quick action , or a slow, silent, imperceptible move? Shall I creep? Shall I fly? "                                                                                        -John Adams

      She is again gone, fictional reader. Here I am again, inert and broken. She says nothing of the pain and doubt she causes, just paints herself the hero and I the villain once again. Maybe it was I who have been dreaming all along. Maybe she's not the woman I took her for, but I doubt it. I have nothing better to write about then hardship. The pain she's inflicted, this life I lead, my foolishness: It's all here. I want to write about happy things, but cannot muster the simple joys needed to do so.  I am so lost. As the antithesis of my aims in this latest debacle; I doubt she cares. I have been so awful. What will I do, you ask fictional reader? Nothing. There is nothing I can do, but kit up and move out. It's what she's done. Maybe I should just follow her lead. What cowards we both are. She is no more fearless than I.

      This is a big leap for me fictional reader. My heart is again very full, just full of something much different now. I hope it's me she wants and not something else. I'm so afraid I won't be able to live up to her expectations. I don't know how to support a family without the aid of the military. It's everything I am. Yet I am willing to part ways with this great establishment if it means I can have everything else. Careers worry me.   My father, God bless him at least had a trade when he worked his way through college. The only think I'm qualified to do when I get out is bounce at a titty bar and wait tables. Not a good profession for a man with a family. I pray we can work this out. We are two people with an great wealth of intelligence between the two of us. There must be something we can come up with. If I'm not slinging lead for the next sixteen years, then what am I doing.   I never looked at the military in terms of a career. God I couldn't wait to get out. I wanted to so bad at one point. Now I just feel like I  have  to get out. If it's one or the other I pick her. But I if I pick her will I be able to support us. The family. Everyone has a family. But it's the logistical concerns. The man stuff that worries me. She's so great comforting me when I feel like this.   She's so tired. She's sleeping now as I write this and soon I will be too. I think I should contact my father. I need some man to man advice. How did he hold a family together all those years. I know he didn't do it alone. God, if you're reading this and I'm sure you are: Please bring her a bestseller so I can do nothing but drive the riding mower at our country estate. Is that too much to ask?  Her blog tonight made me feel very warm. She defended me.

      It's Corpus Cristi, fictional reader. The feast of the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Right now Major Vakoc, our parish priest languishes in Walter Reed's coma ward following an IED strike he was incapacitated in. He lost an eye and will have brain damage. We survived ours with only cuts and scratches. We could question all day why he is hurting and we are not. It's not ours to ponder. He taught me that peace is not the absence of war. True peace is found in the embrace of love.  It's hot on  Marez  today. This paper is due in forty-eight hours. I'm going to make it. It's going to be good. Corn-Chips has lent me his laptop and I'm going to peck away until it is done. I'm quite hungry with still many things to take care of. I'm going to wait a little bit longer for her then hit the road. She works very hard, fictional reader.

      She's rendered me nearly speechless, fictional reader.Which is a difficult feat as you may well know. What a hold she has on me. To turn me sorrow to glee with one a few words. My prayers are answered. Where we go from here I can't say. Just as long as were together, I know we can make it. I am very a happy man.

      I will attempt, dear fictional reader to bring my story to a conclusion, but can promise no certain resolution, however. Not wishing to waste your time any further I shall advance beyond my irrevocable failure. My language will be precise for articulation and felicity are the obscure hues I will need to paint a proper portrait of my lost lady. It is obvious to me that you know nothing of my advancement from adolescent lusting to the familial longing that now calls to me.   I've loved many people. However, Adrienne is regarded as on the greatest. This remains even now as time, circumstance, and distance separate us. The strength of her heart is the rarest of all. He life has been difficult,bound in interlocking setbacks and disappointments. But still, dear reader she dreams and it is beautiful. She believes in goodness and in the fantastic love of cinema and fiction. She hopes contagiously and unknown to her I too found myself a dreamer, lost in the awesome ideals of love.   Mine was a dutiful and sacrificial love. Her's is the sacred bond between man and woman. The love I wish was ours again. Without her passion I am a hollow lover. With even a hint of it I feel strong and helpless at once, holding my hear and wishing for more. But in irrational fear I mocked her. I doubted this foolish dreamer, whom I dared call friend and lover. This had escaped me until only recently. She now leaves me longing for the happy years that cannot be. She leaves me crying for home,family, and the many glad times and happy years.   Adrienne has made this soldier's life obsolete and worth leaving. I would sacrifice these cheap and frivolous martial accomplishments for just one happy day at her side. She's made me believe I could be more then I ever dreamed of. I not half so inspired without her. She is more remarkable then I can say with presumably more secrets then I should ever know. She does this all plainly with effortless ease. Her presence drives me to new heights, her absence to all new lows. But I fear, fictional reader my words are in vain. A defeat could not be any more final.   But I do now see all these great dreams fading. The home we will never share, the children we will never raise, the glad times that will never be, brings me to tears daily. My heart is in ashes. While it may be possible to love again, I would only be as I've said, second best. I have found the one who holds everything I long for. Most people never get to find such a lover and friend, much less lose one. She loved me once as I love her, what a treasure I have carelessly discarded. Others will take to her side of course. I hold her in the highest esteem, unique and irreplaceable. Such is not my merit. I must be now relinquished to the status of a common man, in steady supply and non-descript.   I have none to blame but myself. My pain is entirely self inflicted. I foolishly did not realize in sacrificing any hope of togetherness that I would end my own happiness. The glad tidings are now long gone and I must learn to love loneliness for many years to come. Please spare me your many insults,fictional reader for you are a cynic. But for now, without my lover I am nearly nothing.

      One for the road, fictional reader. I should have combined these two post but I needed time away from the computer to think. What better way then to give one's self a haircut. Showered and shaved, I can't wait to finish losing all this weight. It doesn't seam so impossible any more. Like I'm not reaching for something so distant. I've been doing my random Broadway outbursts the last week.  Corn-chips says he always knows I'm in a good mood when I do them. I have two voices. One is a a very cartoony voice that I use for light showtunes. The other is a somber tenor that I'm very fond of. It's for more classic pieces. I never share it. I like singing in the shower. God the showers are great here. My latest playlist has been from  The Scarlet Pimpernel  and breaks down like this:  1. Falcon in the Dive 2. Where's the girl? 3. Prayer 4. When I look at you 5. She was there  What a great show it is. I'd wished I'd seen it before it closed. Swordplay, masks, the vile French getting their just deserts, and love victorious. What's not to want? I can't stay long it's late I need to get the boys up early. Oh yes, I nearly forgot. So I'm reading People in the waiting room and get this shit.   Fox has a show called  The Swan  where they subject ordinary woman to gurling plastic surgeries to radically change their lives. I think this is a disgusting display. Yet it reports high ratings. Can we sink any lower? Oh yes and sadly Adreana is dead. They killed her off on the Sopranos, very sad.   Philip Henslowe: You see, comedy. Love, and a bit with a dog. That's what they want.

      I shouldn't have linked her to the site fictional reader. I was regretting it by time morning rolled around two hours later. I think she would have just deleted the e-mail anyway. You told me it was a stupid idea, but I did it. That's what we do. We make mistakes like everyone else in the real world does. It's so hard to carry on. I find my job infinitely easier then dealing with this loss. These sentiments are hopelessly wasted. They're mine to waste, so I do so. I might just keep this up forever. It's not fair to pick second best.  That's all anyone is ever going to be in my eyes. So I collapse to matters of fantasy. Speaking of which I believe I have a small, yet mounting crush on Abigail Adams. She was a very pretty woman as the period portraits lend view of. She was a devoted wife and mother despite the fact that her husband was obnoxious and not well liked, and that her children were sick often. She opened every letter to him while he was away with " My dearest friend". I find that so romantic and incredibly hot. So here's to you Mrs.Adams, even though you are quite dead.  Jen Scully is on this site and commented if you have not noticed, fictional reader, so be on your best behavior. She's the only one left that tells me to stick this out. My mother is silently supportive, she likes her after all. My friends tire of hearing about her. Everyone tells me to quit. How very sad this life is going to be. If this is to be the greatest regret and truthfully my only one then so be it. I just wish I knew how this was to all end. I will never quit loving her.   I think it is proper that I learn a musical instrument. You're less likely to contract Alzhimers if you are proficient. What a daunting task it is to be educated and somewhat refined. I feel as if I am gaining balance. Leaving the crutch of ulta-conservatism behind and adopting the idea that ethics is really a system of decision making that must be constantly assessed and reassessed. I'm not Augustine of Hippo and I'm never going to be. I still think abortion is wrong but I don't think stem cell research and gay marriage is going to turn the world on it's head.     Light day at work today, tomorrow will not be the same. Will is back from the hospital. He's got a bunch of stitches in his neck. He doesn't look the same. I have the oddest suntan, but I should write of that another time. Burnstien's  Power of Gold   needs to be read and there is of course this fucking essay that needs to be attended to. Hope to get it done and published in the next 24 hours. Hows that for optimism.

      I told chief when we refittng  Two-One  that it appeared to be a shoddly constructed IED. When Lil-Man came back from crater analysis of the site he found evidence of something much grander. It was daisy chained 155mm shells. Haj dug them too deep so the only blew up not out. Will and Tommy got the front of the blast while Ding and I only caught the rocks and dust. I was so jumpy when we got to the hospital. So very emotional today. But I'm fine now. Yes sad,but ready to fight again if we're called on.   Can't wait to bust Will's balls about being hurt. When he went down and the asked if he was Ok, He grasped his bleeding neck and gave a thumbs up with a "Yo Joe!" like Sgt.Sluaghter does in the movie. I hope he got to call his wife after the operation. My head still fucking hurts and this Iraqi summer is playing hell with my allergies. I didn't even know I had them. I'm OK fictional reader. I didn't think I would be. Now if I could get this paper on the Greeks started. Now that would be a sight.   I don't want the life of Periclies and Aspasia. I just want to come home.

      It wasn't until I was in the hospital waiting room that my head really start to hurt. The explosion only hit Will and Thompson, despite the fact that it blew directly adjacent to me. We were on our way home when the IED detonated in the small shitty village we'd been working out of the past week or so. They could hear the explosion back on  FOB: Marez , seven miles away.  Obviously, fictional reader I am alive. Covered in debris my knees buckled as I stood in the sentry hatch of  Two-One  as it races from the kill zone. The ramp drops and we rush off the back still in the cloud of smoke. The streets are empty and I look back to see the work of the enemy. Will and Scrogg-Dog are down. The boys are scared and they have good reason to be. We've yet to move more then twenty meters out of the kill zone. I yell to them to start first aid and take command of the squad Corn-chips and the old man get to work.   Mounted back We assess the casualties. I think  Scroggins is dead and Will is on his way. With the ramp locked back and all aboard we again move out, putting about a thousand meters behind the ambush point and ourselves. Doc jumped on board and we took off for the CSH. They'll be ok it seams. Now I find that Thompson is hit as well but he continues to TC the vehicle. I'm worried some of the boys might also be hit. When we get to the hospital we quickly offload the wounded and take accountability of the gear and the damage assessment of the vehicle. Scroggins hurt his neck in the explosion, Will and Thompson both took shrapnel. They'll live.  I need her tonight. But she's not here for me. I need her words and touch to scare the sorrow away. I've needed her more tonight then I have in year, but she will not come to me. All my weaknesses and inaptitudes could have never steered her my side so it is needless to  lament. I cannot cry for what was never mine to lose. I should not pin hope on the hopeless. But I do all these things. Like the Greeks she loves so much, I am paradoxically doomed. My love for her is both my greatest source of solace and my greatest damning inequity. I am absolute in my sorrow.   I am so happy to be alive, but to what end fictional reader I cannot say. If happiness is not mine to have what is? I want to know when I will be free to love again. Five years? Ten Years? Never? I close here. I can't keep from wanting to cry. I have several times tonight. But for now I march on, it's all I can do. Tomorrow will find me in the saddle and once more I dream of her. Tomorrow will find her free of me. Like Valjean's neverending road to Calvary I take up my cross and move out.   For now I have some awards to write for some very brave men. I will downplay my involvement in the days action. I don't want medals. I just want a life worth leading.

      My copy of  Liberty!  arrived today from Amazon.com. I had said in a previous post that I found the documentary dramatic. This is not drama, this is near poetry. The stirring words of Adams and Payne moved me to tears. My generation is debased and dispassionate. Yet they are not beyond esteem. I don't feel alone when I recount their deeds.  All the greats of times past were besieged in darkness and doubt. How I envy these men and women who found it in themselves to save our people. Sure, even Alexander. Words have inspired me. Soldiering has not. I have never wept when we have destroyed. I've taken no joy in awesome displays of firepower. I have sacrificed something far greater then I could have even know in taking my oath. I pray it's not too late.   A quick etymology for fictional reader. The term debased has come to mean morally cheapened. It's origin is rooted in coinage. When a ruler hadn't enough money in ancient times he recalled silver and gold money and literally reduced the amount of precious metal in them. By adding fillers a ruler could increase the amount of purchasing power he had at the same cost. So to debase is to cheapen a coin. The Romans were notorious debasers as was Henry VII.  There you have it,something introspective and real

      She is the girl of my dreams,literally. She keeps me company on long patrols and those endless hours in the saddle. Their nice dreams I think. Things that can never happen though. But I'm always going to love her. You just can't cage some birds. Forgive my many cliche's, fictional reader. As I write this The Dixie Chicks are crooning  Landslide  on the radio and I'm exhaused. How am I ever going to explain her to the next woman in my life? Should I even try, maybe she's best kept to myself.    I yet again haven't the strength to be introspective. The last forty-eight hours have been hard on us with some relief for a time today. Just enough time to recover the boys and get a load of laundry on the clothesline. I cracked the 180's yesterday, finally, fictional reader  (189 -31lbs, 280PT) . Yes those italics were necessary. Did you know italics were invented to save paper? Speaking of history I need to get this Greece paper started. I'm picking the easy topic, I don't have time to be Shelby Foote with this shit.   I caught a clip of the Tony's at the gym yesterday. It was Nicole Kidman giving Hugh Jackman his award, I guess even Broadway is rigged now too, fuckers. Anyway she was dressed very casually with her hair tied back and little wire framed glasses. Very pretty. I'm considering graduate school abroad. What's better then a brilliant woman? A brilliant British woman. Someone told me to try AmericanSingles.com for a woman to distract me. Maybe it's worth a shot. *Yawns* To bed I go. I'm so incoherent.

      It was fucking 117 degrees at the TCP today. Do you have any idea how fucking hot that is fictional reader? I'm beat. So its to bed I go. Had a very inspirational conversation with my pop today. Not much to tell. Worked on my accent a bit more with the locals. Made a few of them laugh. I think it's the novelty of a westerner speaking arabic. Maybe it's because I'm one goofy bastard? Who knows.

      Reagan is dead. I could do an impression of him before I could do the multiplcational table. People die, yeah I know. Nintey-three is impressive age to live to, even with Alzhiemers. That merc from yesterday had me thinking on mortality, eventhough his death was really of no consequnce to me. I don't want to lose my parents, but they're getting older. Dad is in his early sixties and mom is no kid either. I feel like maybe I owe them grandchildren. Is that silly, fictional reader? It's well past my bed time, I should go. She misses me. Glad to see I'm not alone.

      We don't do boots for mercs. That's what I told my guys when they asked why no one really gave a shit about the SUV mangled and covered in blood sitting in the motorpool. Doc pulled the brit out of his truck after Haj and his buddies got the drop on him. Feel bad for his family but not for him. Mercs aren't like us. They're hear to make a buck. A hundred-thousand of them, actually. They're like soldiers without souls. I pity them.  I can't make up my fucking mind when to go to selection. Should I get more college in the fall or in the spring, fictional reader? I'm so torn. Tomorrow I'm going to e-mail Mullaney about my essay and see how I can make this next one better. I'm pulling a 3.4 in her class. I want more, I want a 3.8, minimum. If I ace the next two assignments it just puts me at .1 shy of my goal. It feels so good to be a student. I real student, well sort of.  Kirk, e-mailed me today. He didn't know about our three KIAs. I was so nonchalant it. Was I trying to be veteran, fictional reader or has life really become so cheap here in the ITO? The brit is one issue, but our three fallen is something completely different. Can a man lament forever. We shall see.

      I got my results last night from Mullaney. I got an A for that fucking terrible document review and a fucking B- for the essay. What the fuck, fictional reader? Whatever. We're supposed to have some what of a day off so I'll begin working on the Classical Greece essay, I'm not sure if I'll do the essay about the  polis  or one on Alexander the Great. I don't think he was too great. Actually I think he was something of a fuckng prick. He used the kick ass army that his father built to trounce two cultures that were both already on the decline for 150 years. Asshole.   But that's my privledge, from that safety of 2300 years I get to pick apart his achievements. Not like I've done anything that could be classified as "Great". I'm going to cruise the personals for a bit. They're a some fucking losers on the internet. Glad to see I'm not alone after all. Hope that dorky MI-Chick move back to  Marez . Maybe I could grow a set of balls and talk to her. *sigh* Oh well. I have all those Punk songs that Kate sent me stuck in my head. See ya.

      Tonight is the night I believe, fictional reader. Tonight I'll set her free. It's silly to continiue like this. I love her enough to let her go. I bear the pain so she can be free of me. It's the last thing I'll ever do for her. I'm happy I can at least be of some help in this fashion. I'm so sad.

      I'm lonely tonight. I've been growing to this for a few days. She's doing great no thanks to me. She just seams so far away now. Why can't I stop thinking,writing,talking ect ect about her. I feel so low when I read about her life, just guilty for the years I feel like I stole from her. I should have been a help not a burden. She could never just be the wife of a soldier, how could I ask that of her.   Someone asked me to recap. I think I've hit it dead on:   Lets see if I can encapsulate this.I was hindering her growth. I was choking the life out of her and I didn't even know it. So now that I realize it and know what to do I've let go long enough for her to see a great world without me. One she wouldn't risk just for someone as plain and toxic as I. So that's it. The End.    Yes, I know fictional reader, you grow bored of her, but fuck you. You're not even real. To be seven thousand miles from a home that's hardly worth returning to. What the fuck do you know about me?  On the upside I'm shaping up to be quite the historian. Maybe someday I can be the world's leading authority on leading a trivial life and fucking up the best thing I had going for me, but oh well to bed I go.

      Surprisingly there is no one online to talk to but the ignorant, fictional reader. You have time to listen? These past few days have marked increasing happiness for me. Though the world shifts an churns about me, I've felt tranquil despite it. The paper is done and submitted. I think it's pretty good. We'll see what the doc thinks. My copy of SP showed up just as I was writing my last post Corn-chips literally hand carried my box from Amazon.com to the cafe and presented it to me, he's a good kid.   We were out working with the IP's in the western part of the city. It was hot as fuck and since we weren't the main effort there part of the squad was hunkered down in the shade. I let them rest and stayed up on the road to keep an eye on the IP's. Their lazy PKM Gunner took his weapon off the truck and tried to get in the shade too. Yes I told him in Arabic to move the gun back to the truck :  Tu reed imshee al rashasha ihna.     The TCP we were set in on was adjoined to an ancient church dating back tot the times of Nostorious in the 4th century after his split with the Chruch(capital C). Someone told me the church dated back 2050 years to the time of the Ottoman empire. I called bullshit, because the Ottoman's wouldn't take hold of Iraq into 1300's, a scant 700 years ago. Fucker. I continued to talk about the ancient Assyrians capital, who's ruins were buried under this very city. It was hot as fuck when Scrog-Dogg showed up to take the next shift for Corn-Chips.    He was watching me out in the sun for those two hours while they all rested. Later on he told me I needed to get out, that I was meant to do greater things. It's stuck with me these past few days. As I labored to create my paper and really thought on it tonight, I don't think I could do this these next 16 years. That maybe I am made for greater things then just slinging lead and sweating my ass off. Who knows what. But I'm starting to like the idea of being a intellectual much more then being a soldier. That's something right?  I've been again reading her Blog. She's so happy. I've never seen her like this. At best I am now a third person viewer, living as a voyeur though her blog. wish you could read how much joy it's brought her.  I wouldn't want to say anything to her and ruin her happiness so I remain unrequited and silent. Bittersweet as it is, maybe it's for the best. I'm praying for her like always.   Hm, yep no response to my personal. I think it's sad when your closest confidant these days is your imaginary friend on the internet. I need to get out more. I'm off to sleep then study the ancient Greeks. Do you think I should send her the link, fictional reader?

      You should see the way the  Al Jonai Mosque ( resting place to the prophet Jonnah) illuminates Mosul's skyline, fictional reader. From the northern banks of the Tigris it towers like urban omage to The Pharos of Alexandria, a beacon of hope in a sea of slums. The city rose of from the ashes Nineveh, razed by Medes and Neo-Babylonians 612BCE. It's population numbers four million people who come from all walks of life, Sunni Kurds, Turks, Syrians, Jews, Chaldean, and Syrac Catholics. It was we, the smallest minority, Blackhawk Company that found ourselves stalking the quiet and ancient streets on a snatch n' grab the other night.  Counterterrorism is humdrum work,dear reader. Infiltrate neighborhood A, Cordon house B, Breech door C, Capture target D, Exfiltrate neighborhood A, End State. But it is a rewarding and fruitful venture that saves lives and gets the trash off the streets. But what really caught my eye was the architecture of my surroundings. Narrow cobble stone roads snake through an endless maze of homes that grew without thought of commercial development, much like the  polis  of the Greeks. Present were stone and mortar homes with shoddy wiring, and the droning of recorded fiddle and Arab verse filled the hot night air as we sought our quarry. A forty man assault platoon really ruins these kinds of things.  I begin to enjoy the aesthetics of civilization, dear reader. An arched walkway, early medieval religious art, the words of the ancients are all quite lovely to me. But we are at war, we have always been, and will always be. I feel so selfish to turn my back on what feels so right. If there was some equilibrium between scholar and soldier, I would we feel quite fortunate to find it. While choked by my comrades idiocy and insolence, I would much miss the service of the county and people who I feel need me most. To turn my weapon in and go my own path, feels irresponsible. Duty is paradoxically stressful, fictional reader.  But life is for the most part good. I have all that I could wish for save one. I think of her on the nights my thinking is elevated. When I see the world for what it truly is, both in vice and virtue. I wonder if she would be proud of me. Would she even care that I have made such advances this year? Would she even notice? It's not enough that the pretty girls don't notice me. What's worse is the one I love the most doesn't even take me seriously. How very depressing. I won't be around for the next day or so, more work to tend to. Now that school is in recess I can continue books that I have neglected. I'm enjoying Plato and Burnstien, however I've found errors in fact contained therein the latter. I plan on writing and exposing his faults, maybe he'll send me some free things.    Mother's Younger Brother was in love with Evelyn Nesbit. From his regular seat in the front row of the second balcony, he would lean far over the railing, hoping his goddess would notice him. One night he almost fell. Evelyn caught sight of him and smiled. Life was suddenly wonderful and full of delicious possibilities.  -Ragtime

      We're spending the next few days on  FOB: Freedom  for some bullshit handshake mission, fictional reader. I have much to say, but really very little strength to say it. Hi 101 kinda drained me so I'm going to take a few days away from the site and collect my thoughts. There's a lot of things to be happy about, and really except for this one lingering black cloud, life is good. I guess that's why those two days were so wonderful to me, and so readily believed in. I'm very tired, dear reader, so I again close   I got an A-, and might get make the 5k race on the 5th, time permiting. Cool huh?

      I'd like to write about many things, dearest fictional reader, but I am inclined to say my peace at a later time. The class is finished. I am fucking historian, albeit three credits closer anyway. What work is there for a 27 year ex-army historian you might ask? I can't say. But I like where it's leading me.&nbsp; I am fucking exhausted. This cycle of study/sleep/study for two weeks produced six papers of varying quality. I'm back with the boys and shall write more later   *yawns*

      Not since the Germanic tribes toppled the Roman empire had there been such a shift in power within Europe. By the eleventh century the hold feudal lords had over their vassals was slipping beyond the irrevocable. The immergence of cities and the merchant class would prune the power base of the country nobility and challenge their legitimacy as the ruling class. It is in this period we see the emergence of organizations who’s sole focus is to protect the rights and interest of the craftsmen, who in times past as a serf went virtually unguarded. At it’s conclusion this new urban infrastructure allies itself, not with the gentry of old, but with their rightful sovereigns, giving national character and socioeconomic depth to formally factionalized realms.   The early middle ages can be classified by political struggle. Where autonomy is granted by an overload, his subordinate vassal uses this leniency to strengthen his hold as potentate. Predictably, the lower nobility acquire all possible influence and the sovereign is relinquished to the status of figurehead. The weakness and subsequent failure of the Merovingingan line stands as an example of this detrimental factionalization. It was these feudal rulers’ lust for greater power that lead to the development of towns. In theory these new holdings would further embed the authority of country nobility by increasing the economic output of the fife exponentially.   Towns were originally conceptualized to be an urban extension of the lord’s country estate. Charters served as formal permission for surfs to venture into the wilderness and carve out new holdings in their master’s name. In turn, the nobility granted semi-autonomy to the vassals who paved the roads to early municipalities. Ideally this would create an influx of highly desirable manufactured products to bolster the lord’s solely agrarian revenue. Surfs, who’s professional scope formerly encompassed little more then the necessary skills to tend fields, found themselves members of a growing and skilled labor force. Since finished goods carried much more purchasing power then raw materials, the craftsmen soon pay their feudal dues with their surplus wares. As the antitheists of noble intent, urbanization begins undermining the relevance of country life.   A singularly matchless character immerges during this period of urban development. The merchant (or burgher) is a man of consummate enterprise and ravenous commercial thirst. Through shrewd long-distance international trade he has vaulted himself from ignoble craftsman to a unique upper class, adorned with inestimable liquid capital unrivaled by country landowners. Differentially this rapid assent earned them both the scorn of the ruling lordship and the adoration of aspiring artisans. Though opinions of the merchant were as varied as the products they peddled, their contribution to European urbanization and subsequent nationalism is undeniable.   Because the old feudal infrastructure was ill equipped to handle the new influx of potentially far reaching trade, this transition was not instantaneous. Cutting into the burgher’s profits were age old tariffs that had once served to protect the cloistered feudal lords’ economic interests. To bypass this, merchants consolidated their growing political influence to form protective associations that eliminated the potency of the antiquated trade regulations. In turn, craftsman following the example of their idolized heroes form similar organizations, (guilds) who in time would play their own role in the development of towns.   By the time of the Crusades the previously defined socioeconomic norms were coming part at the seams. To add the high nobility’s woe, their budding towns were being driven by commercial needs to ally themselves with the previously weakened monarchy. While local lords were familiar, townspeople preferred to conduct trade in the name of a internationally recognized ruler. This aided counterfactionalization and placed increased authority in the hands of the king. Nobility, in lieu of obsolesce would soon adopt alternate means of maintaining their titular legitimacy.   As a corollary to the comprehensive twelfth century social restructuring, old feudal lords are transformed by an amalgamation with burgher mercantilism to construct a new urban aristocracy. This innovative ruling class asserted political authority by entrenching itself with the established town councils. Guilds were then empowered with the necessary leverage to maximize both their marketable output and political significance. Though this reformation would create new social inequality and class division, there was a fresh sense of worthiness felt by commoners that had been long absent in the previous centuries. Great commercial wealth coupled with majestic elegance was the benchmark of achievement that all aspired to.   None embodied this visage more then the ruling monarchs of this period. As protector and provider of metropolitan sovereignty, a king was desirable to commoners compared to local lords who could at times be despotic and expansive. Once in the favor of the populace, kings could reap the benefit of such an advantageous association. Cities not only supplied a steady supply of wealth, but also cutting edge technologies and an abundance of educated civil servants to staff the many bureaucracies linked with a rising national monarchy. Though the city’s independence was gradually pruned in later centuries, their alliance to country and not to fief was instrumental to the progression to true national government.   In summary, the medieval towns birthed in the eleventh and twelfth centuries were intended at first as urban reflections of nearby feudal bastions. The prosperity long of distance trade brought the enterprising merchants later coupled with nobility to the forefront of European urbanization. This change was radical because it demonstrated the great gains that can be made with a marriage of mercantilism and country nobility. Secondly, it advanced the ideas of nationalism as monarchs gain true power and establish lasting contributions to their respective realms. Finally towns improved the lives of all by providing a much higher standard of living, one that could have never been provided for all on the country manors of the feudal age. It was these radical changes that confirmed the worth of the common man, who unattached to the prospects of noble birth could rise to a position previously inconceivable.

      There's this picture of Adrienne that I'm fond of; her hair is down to the side of her face. Coupled with a coy smile and set of glasses on her nose she looks quite the scholar and accordingly, incredibly hot. It's on her Yahoo profile and I look at it from time to time. It makes me happy for some reason. Hell, I even carried it on my person for a little while. One might call me deluded for placing such arbitrary sway in an item of apparel, but I'm a sucker for a girl who looks the part. So you might ask where things stand with dorky-glasses-girl? Being too embarrassed to sketch the details of a such short lived debacle, that I am inclined never to bring her up again, dear reader. Still a girl with something of her own to say is more attractive then an entire legion of underwear models on Fashion TV.   So again, on Yahoo Personals( why do we make the same mistakes over and over again?) I read this ad for a girl who says she writes "literature". Can this be a misnomer, or this woman really that spectacular?  Literature dear reader encapsulate the sociopoltical climate of it's target audience and places it in such a spectacular format as that ensure it's remembrance. Yes, they are nice stories but they hold in them the key to the advancement of civilization. Homeric poems are prime examples. While they are certainly enjoyable and epic, they reminded the Hellenistic world of what it meant to be ideally Greek. Conversely the later writings of Plato and Aristotle, are reactive compositions reminding the reader what would be required to reverse the declination of their culture.  Maybe she just means prose, lacking to propriety of technical expertise to explain her thinking. Which would be a moot point anyway. Literature...fuck. How can one be so bold? I'm a soldier, however I don't walk around calling myself Alexander The Great, or claiming I'm a martial virtuoso without peer. Why do these " Box of Rocks "- Girls hover like gnats and quality women of intelligence and beauty barely know I'm alive? Shouldn't I be entitled to a girl who reads and posses a mastery of her native tongue? I want my fucking money back Yahoo.com, Bastards.  Ok, enough of my ranting. French MTV calls. I've acquired a tolerance for Britney Spears (  Everytime  isn't a bad video). I've got less then forty eight hours to finish this class and still there is one final paper that requires my attention. So I remain your's dearest fictional reader, John Andrews, Vagabond Historian, Armed-To-The-Teeth-Singleton, and less then ninety days from my native soil.   "  I myself cannot understand a woman who can quote the rules of grammar and never make a mistake and cites obscure long forgotten poets as if men cared about such things. If she has to correct somebody let her correct girlfriends and leave her husband alone ! "     - Juvenal, Roman Satirist

      I just watched a captain confront a young lieutenant about his duties as an officer. The young man sniffled and apologized for his actions, some trivial transgression I'd wager to guess. None the less it made me smile. It is the first day of a new class here at the ING&nbsp;academy and as a favor&nbsp;have been&nbsp;given&nbsp;staff duty to&nbsp;monitor the radio and soak up pretty models on Fashion TV, we have&nbsp;it programmed on two separate channels. Be that as it may I am also stationed here as finish my reading on the Protestant Reformation and draft&nbsp;my final paper for History 101.   So why do you ask, fictional reader,&nbsp;I am here and not there? It's idle hands that have created an idle mind and so I cannot think of anything but her. It's like those long night patrols or observation posts where there is nothing to do by survey the city under the glow of NVG's. It'll be twenty-three months since we broke up when I return home, and should be getting a life of my own, but am compelled to do little but sulk. It's the worse in these quiet hours, when I should be working, when I should be doing anything but thinking of her, that she comes to me.   On top of all this it's perfectly apparent to me that life is totally fucking unfair.     Marty: Hi. I'm, uh, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell couch insurance. Mm-hmm, and I - and I test-market positive thinking. I lead a weekend men's group, we specialize in ritual killings. Yeah, you look great! God, yeah! Hi, how are you? Hi, how are you? Hi, I'm Martin Blank, you remember me? I'm not married, I don't have any kids, and I'd blow your head off if someone paid me enough.

      I recently had a discussion with a&nbsp; man I respect concerning the religious backbone of the nations formative years. He claims that United States was found on Christianity. I could not convince him of the error of his thinking. He is quite charismatic and witty and often leaves me say " Oh, I should have said that" for days. He closed with some neo-republican drivel about the untied states being the good guy.&nbsp; He was of course speaking of ethics, not the cowboy and Indian foreign policy we have developed through the years. The roots of our government&nbsp;is humanism, and not sole Christian.   When Rev. Witherspoon of New Jersey may have lobbied for the addition of "... with a firm reliance in divine providence." in the Declaration of Independence, this&nbsp;means he is of the faithful, not wishing a sort of semi-theocracy in years to come. Jefferson was writing of a freedom that transcended aristocratic holds&nbsp;over the common man. This elevation, based on earlier thinking,&nbsp;celebrated man as special entity that could choose&nbsp;his own path and for better or for worse, was at least entitled an attempt. Yes, it is an equality that would most certainly be endorsed by Christ, however just because our founding fathers were Christians did not mean this country is based off the bible.   It's&nbsp;chronic good-guyism that&nbsp;plagues my profession, dearest reader. It is difficult for soldiers to see why we fight and that the end whatever the cost, more than justifies the means. My peers just find it easier&nbsp; to label the enemy as "Haji", dehumanize him and shoot to kill. It is much harder to identify our enemies and men of zeal and intelligence&nbsp;just as we are,&nbsp;here with their own ideals, exercising their own political authority in a daily battle. I respect the men we face and as our time draws to a close, discover a new respect for duty and damn the soldier's bravado as enthusiasm run a muck. I am here because it's what has to be done. For the good of people who do not know any better and who lack the scope of vision necessary for&nbsp;political thought and civic responsibility.   I adore Jesus Christ, but he did not teach me how or why to fight. But one must separate the world of man and the world of God, which when intermixed leads to the human corruption of both. &nbsp;In fact my profession and the larger political scheme of maneuver, go counter to his teaching to the utmost. I'm reminded of CS Lewis' thoughts on good and evil. Mr. Lewis argues that evil is not the absence of good. It is the abomination of good that creates evil, a shortcut taken to achieve great things at the smallest cost. There can be no good achieved without cost, human,ethical, or monetary. Everybody buys and&nbsp;everybody pays something. This war, which is not a war mind you,(and we'll discuss that later) has effected all that&nbsp;are touched by it, From Michael Moore to the brighteyed PV2 who first steps off the C-130 as a replacement and realizes just how hot this place is, no one can escape it.   That's my two cents before I put on my running shoes and claim another seven miles. I feel a part of a small and elite corp that possesses the ability to see what is truly happening here. I have used these many months wisely gaining an education that can only be granted under hostile fire, and in viewing the shattered visage of the fallen claimed by either side. That's what I call nontraditional education. But I'm off to train, gotta look good for the chicks, how's that for good-guyism?

      I pounded trail for seven miles this morning after staying up all night, reading of the Italian renaissance. I struggle to define the nature of my education. Distance learning is a new concept and I find it difficult to see it as anything but a sham. It's my passion for the humanities that allows me to learn the material with such ease. I could not however master microbiologly for instance, via e-mail. I do not consider myself a student in the traditional sense. I am self taught in this discipline and only receive modest guidance and feedback from a reputable institution.&nbsp;None the less I've enjoyed this class and look forward to the next semester that begins in just a few short weeks.   French television is an odd assortment of the following: Music videos, One of Four Movies, or Pornography. The latter of which is subclassified from 7am to 2am the following morning as soft core of ( -16 rating ) With such titles as&nbsp;  Les Sexy Mercenaries &nbsp; in which scantly clad and nubile frenchwomen perform daring deeds armed to the teeth with soviet era small arms, subsequent fucking ensues. From 2am to 7am the hardcore ( -18 rating ) dominates up to seven channels with titles like&nbsp;  Les Petite Africans  where school aged black coeds get lanced by filthy uncircumcised European members. Oddly enough, fictional reader,I can't stop watching.   There's been some good advice offered to me on this site as of late, I'm grateful for all of it. It's hard to turn away from your dreams, especially when they were so good and in your grasp. I still pin my hopes on resolution and closure, whatever the outcome&nbsp;may be, though like dreams we don't always get what we want. Beggars can't be choosers, after all. I'd like to report that I am out of my slump dearest fictional reader, but that is a lie and perpetuates a ridiculous cycle of sentiment and wishful thinking. It's ok to be sad sometimes.&nbsp;I hope I run into her today, I might just work up the courage to say something. I just hope I don't have something stuck in my teeth, now that would be embarrassing. There much cramming to do, if I am to finish this class on time, so I close.     Marty:&nbsp;They all have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs, and, you know, they've all made themselves a part of something and they can talk about what they do. What am I gonna say? "I killed the president of Paraguay with a fork. How've you been?"

      It's hard to know where all this ends and where a new life can begin. The other day I was in the chowhall walking to the fridge for a cold soda when I ran into her, literally. The girl with the glasses at first gives me small polite smile, but then appears to do a double take and smiles again even wider. It gave me sheen of glee that no tongue-in-cheek suppression could easily undo. Yes, I'm certain this is nothing and I am as always reading into this.&nbsp;But it made my day.&nbsp;None the less I e-mailed Kate about her (they're from the same unit), she turns out to be a friend of her's and that her&nbsp;name is Sage. Pretty, no?   It's hard not to think about her during all this. No dearest reader, I haven't opted&nbsp;to move on just yet but I've got to keep moving and&nbsp;keep breathing. Yes, Adrienne might very well love me, but either not as I love her, or won't allow herself to do so. Like so many things that are wondrous and beautiful, a painting, a sunset, or a rain storm,&nbsp; love them as you might, they cannot love you back. So it might just be many more years till I find someone who makes me half so happy as I am with her. I want to see her,fictional&nbsp;reader. I want to hear her voice, and hold hand when this place is just a distant memory.   I know it's pointless to carry on, but like always it helps. This being said there isn't much else in my life right now. I know these past blogs have been sporadic and informal, but as I race to meet this deadline my focus is with my school work and less on blogging.&nbsp;I know her name which is certainly more then I knew yesterday and has actually made my day once again. I wish I didn't have to do this but there isn't much more I can do, Adrienne won't&nbsp;have me in her life. But any wrongs I've&nbsp;committed&nbsp;have been&nbsp;long paid for in these nine months of&nbsp;misery and longing. I won't beat myself up for it any more, I can't apologize to&nbsp;someone who&nbsp;will not hear me. &nbsp;

        I will not think about this any more after this moment. I will not allow you access to my life... Leave me alone. "&nbsp;     That was the last thing she&nbsp;wrote me before walking out of my life again, fictional reader. I have thought about it many times. Last night as I went to bed and as always prayed for her the only thing I could come up with is "You are second best". Then I dreamt of a wedding proposal. This is a shitty deal. I shouldn't have been second best. But it should have never have been about any of this bullshit. The wedding plans or the kids religion or the $1900.00 rancher's chair from sundancecatalog.com. The minute she gave me a second chance I should have asked why. I should have asked:    &nbsp;    "Are you willing to spend the rest of your life with me knowing that I am less than ideal? Am I what you want truely or are you just setteling? Are you really in love with me?"     For me the answer was clear. She is what I wanted and what I needed. I didn't want to marry Adrienne's career, or her religion, or her diploma, or her eye color, or her dress size or any of those little things that didn't matter. I wanted to spend my life with the person I saw, for better or for worse beyond all that nonsense. Yes, she was using me. Yes, she always was. Yes, I was too foolish to see it for what it was. Yes, I am still in love with her. Yes, this love is a one way street. Yes, this blog will drone on and on.   I could be all wrong, perhaps she's waiting for me bags packed and ready to try again. I'm not a betting man but I roll the dice from time to time, and I wouldn't bet two fucking cents on those odds. She's home, doing her best to forget about me, and obviously like always ahead by leaps and bounds. She's always going to be with me, for the rest of my days&nbsp;even if I never lay eyes on her again.&nbsp;If by chance this isn't the last thing she'll ever say to me, well I have no idea what it is I might say in&nbsp;return. Many thanks again to my many friends who enduring my constant&nbsp;whining.&nbsp;   It's been a good morning for me. I ran the fastest seven mile pace I believe I ever have. At it's conclusion I nearly threw up, but am pleased none the less. But it's these little things one must do to put their life back together. My paper on the medieval merchant class is coming along well. I just hope I finish the class on time. I've been listening to that song from School of Rock that Adam Pascal sings. It's very helpful, as is anything Amy Lee sings. I'm trying my best fictional reader, I really am. Even the very strong were once helpless. So today if I cross pass with that cute girl in the glasses I might just say hello. Isn't that how these things start in the first place?&nbsp;

      Moulin Rouge is fresh in my head. It’s a quite night on FOB: Marez and since the mayor’s assassination there has been no class to train. The break has been nice. So here I sit in my civilian pajamas as it approaches 0400 hours. I have spent the last few days reading the fantastic events of human history and of course thinking about her, like always. I’ve written plenty of times about freedom from her. As said I’m no more free of her now then I was six years ago, the first time I laid eyes on her.   I’m not over her and I don’t want to be, fictional reader. I am still very much in love with Adrienne Cook. There isn’t a day and at times not an hour that passes where she is not in my thoughts and prayers. There are plenty of women who would be willing to replace her, but I couldn’t bring myself to do so. The pretty dork-girl with the  glasses (that lives by Stewart and always smiles at me) isn’t what I need right now. It’s not woman from my past or even the Yahoo.com personals.  Adrinne is what I need. As I watched I complied a short list.  As I said it’s been six years. She’s influenced  me more then she’ll ever know.   She’s inspired me to:  1.  Make a list of the things she’s inspired me to do 2. Be sexy 3. Dress nice 4. Commit 5. Organize my DVD’s 6. Be educated 7. Treat others fairly 8. Drink less 9. Wear breathe-rite strips when I sleep over 10. Save money 11. Plan for the future 12. Give in to love 13. Watch a sunset 14. Enjoy people for their differences 15. Want children 16. Smile more 17. Be unwavering 18. Come home alive 19. Change the world 20. Be a better man 21. Kiss with my eyes open 22. Be myself 23. Treat the conquered with compassion 24. Leave the army 25. Clean my car more often 26. Be on time 27. Learn the following: Ring size, shoe size, favorite flower 28. Care about art 29. Suspend disbelief 30. Make love 31. Try cheesecake 32. Keep my eye on the ball 33. Dance like an idiot 34. Read all that I can 35. Help those who can’t help themselves 36. Look at the stars 37. Walk in the rain 38. Befriend my mother 39. Never poke 40. Take myself less seriously 41. Learn a foreign language 42. Learn a musical instrument 43. Trust animals 44. Do as I’ve said 45. Blog 46. Know there are better days 47. Walk slower 48. Learn her little details 49. Know  myself 50. Put faith in God  	I feel very optimistic right now and happy as well. I have no idea where she is or what she's doing right now. She could be married to the man of her dreams or vaulted to superstardom for all I know. It was Sunday. I could only guess that she's finished working for the week and has enjoyed a latte and a bagel on her way home from work. But I could be wrong. I would love nothing more then to wake up and know that she was mine and I was her's once again. Like most nights I will pray for her before I sleep and hope for the best.If you play the numbers, in all probability tomorrow morning I will be quite disappointed. But still I cling to faith. It has made me strong though not always happy in her absence. Could I really ask for anything more?  Toulouse-Lautrec: Christian, you may see me only as a drunken, vice-ridden gnome whose friends are just pimps and girls from the brothels. But I know about art and love, if only because I long for it with every fiber of my being.

      There's times when I think back to those early days at  FOB:Pacesetter . Al Daluyia is cold in December as well as windy. Blackhawk company did boots for our three fallen a few days after they evac'd their bodies to  LSA:Anaconda  and eventually stateside. Boots is a traditional soldier's memorial. In said ceremony combat boots are displayed in front of an inverted rife with bayonet affixed and stuck into the soil. Next the soldiers dogtags are hung on the weapon's pistol grip and his helmet is set on the buttstock. Finally the dead's comrades gather around and lament their loss. Someone sings "Amazing Grace" and they call it a day.  So yesterday I was up at Mudjat's for lunch and I ran into French. Set on his wrist was a black KIA bracelet, another soldier's tradition. Commonly the bracelet is worn by the living to again, lament the dead. It bears the names of the three and the date they were killed in action. He had a bunch made back on Lewis and is having them shipped here. I pay for my food and give him the change, ten bucks well spent. We're becoming numb to the dead. Back on  Pacesetter  the boys swore up and down that we would never forget the loss. Now it seams a little dated. Soldiers die after all. But I'm sure to Bridges' kids, Wesley's Mom and Dad, and even to Blickenstaff's hated ex-wife that the memory is still very near. We all need bracelets from time to time.  Adrienne told me she knew what I was going through. I don't believe she can ever know. The war is here in the streets, quite far from upstate New York where she makes her home. Maybe she didn't want to know what I've seen or done here or perhaps considers it irrelevant. She's never seen boots, or stuffed dead Fedayeen into a bodybags, or had double stacked 155's blow ten feet from her face. I sent her my blog after the 9 June action. I wanted someone to know it marked the most terrifying and traumatic day of the deployment. It was one that could have easily had my name on a black ten dollar bracelet. But her primary concern wasn't my well being, but that I had upset her little world once again with my appalling prescence.  Maybe I'd been fooling myself all this time to think we could work, after all the only redeeming quality she seamed to be able to offer publicly was that I had a nice ass and eyelashes (which I agree with). I want someone who will defend me as I will defend them. Who could at least offer a "Are you OK?" or " Hey sorry you had a shitty day". I've restarted my Yahoo personal. I deleted it during the two day reconciliation. It's got pictures on it and I actually received a response today. It was from a pretty girl in Yelm, twenty-seven with brown hair. God How I loathe starting all over again. It's an empty and hallow effort I'd rather have not made, but am none the less forced to.  I want a wife for Christmas. Not a girlfriend, a wife. Someone to spend my life with and grow old. So if anyone reading this has got a suggestion please drop me a line, yes even you fictional reader.

      Often you have found me saying that I'm happy, fictional reader. This is untrue, as I am in fact unhappy. You must try to dissociate unhappiness from ingratitude for they are dissimilar. All men's goals aspire to this one blissful state; contentment. One woman should not be able to hold all of this in her hands, but she does. Adrienne's words and decisions have had an irrefutable impact on countless occasions and have become the definitive issue of my life. She's been a catalyst for progression,growth,friendship and of course love. While I may mean nothing to her, she's been everything to me.   So it's my small confession for the day. To take all of these years and throw them in my face and laugh them off as trivia is unfair and hurtful. So for all these reasons, my deal fictional reader. I am far from happy. There are days when I feel like everything might be once again good and right; But not tonight. Tonight I am angry with her, enough to make my jaw ache and my eyes tear. I call it the Blogarithm, look for it, you'll find it on this page and I'm certain many more like it:  1. I feel happy and post about a my freedom from her. 2. I realize freedom is a misnomer and panic. 3. I change the subject and write about personal reform. 4. I briefly distract myself positing a smattering of history or politics. 5. I reach rock bottom reviling just how pathetic I am in her absence.  But this is who I am: I'm John Andrews. I'm twenty three years old not twenty eight. I am Latino/Irish, not British. My eyes are brown, not blue. I am sixty-eight inches tall,so please don't wear heels. I am a poor,uneducated infantryman much different from your friends. I am frightened of animals. I am an excruciatingly slow reader. Bush has my vote. I don't know Vermeer from Rembrandt and I thought Jackass:The Movie was funny. I am flawed in the utmost definition of the word.  I never really believed these superficialities would make her happy. But I'm going to love her for the rest of my life, if she believes me or she does not, dear reader. I'd give anything to spend that lifetime making up for the mistakes I've made (valid and invalid alike). But that choice isn't mine, so nothing is really changed is it.So that's step 5, maybe I'll have something happy to write about tomorrow. But for the time being, it's all bullshit.

      I'd like to recite an anecdote I often share with soldiers who feel the need to brag about their conduct under fire:  " Do you know what huzzah means? That's correct it means to cheer. At Yorktown in 1781 Cornwallis' troops were surrendering to the conquering continental army. The British saw in full view the faces of the men who crushed them into submission. There presented before them were Americans, just like you an I. They were people who left their homes to fight in the name of their country. As the British marched onto the battle field to surrender their arms and battle flags they played a song called  "The World Turned Upside Down"    If ponies rode men And grass ate cows  If spring were summer And the other way round  All the world would  Be upside down  And when the British saw the French, their traditional enemy they sourly threw their weapons on the ground and pouted like children. The Americans broke out into a haughty cheer. But it was Washington who silenced them. He stood tall on a charger riding the length of his bragging troops saying : " Posterity shall huzzah for us,men". Great deeds seldom go unnoticed. So if your actions are truly worth remembering, say nothing of them. It's silent professionalism that elevates a soldier from the common rank and file to the legendary. "  But that's just me, fictional reader. Maybe Washington had something entirely different in mind.

      Often I find myself invited to "forget about her" by those I know. It is precisely however, remembrance that keeps hope alive in my heart. How strange is to see what a difference a year makes. It was twelve months ago that we enjoyed a few pleasant days in New York City. This was the last time I was to share a bed with her or take a hold of her like she was mine. These days were borrowed time however and were no more fitting the Manhattan backdrop we savored. This was the high water mark of a long past relationship, from here on the milestones grow increasingly painful. So here we are both a year later, estranged and unknown to eachother, my dear fictional reader.   One Year. It's a pretty big step. It says: "We've surpassed all the seasons and are ready to begin again". I guess that's all I'm really looking for, another chance. Yes, I am vilified and join the ranks of the men who've came a went. Yes, my feelings have been marginalized to the point of irrelevance. I have been lied to, manipulated, and abused. Sure maybe everyone I know is right, but I cannot forget. Like I've said a million times and will continued to believe that we can be together. This year 2004, we were once again together. Yes, albeit for just two days. But they were wonderful. Who knows what 2005 might bring?   (This has been yet anther in a string of Adrienne related blogs that I pledged never to write, but in truth everyone of them have been necessary. For those of you who've read this site and have offered words of encouragement I feel nothing but gratitude for your help during this very difficult period of my life. Though your personal opinions on the topic vary, your support has been universal, so many thanks.)    Now if you don't mind I'm looking into some stocks and of course Ikea.com, so I close.

      No fictional reader, I have not taken to Pottery Barn, though if ever the economic means to do so presents itself, I just may. Spendthriftiness (aside from the estranged Adrienne) has been at the forefront of my thinking these days. While it is true, I have no significant other to call my own, this will not always be so. It's stability that I now crave and to meet this objective control must be asserted over the areas that have gone unchecked these past years. For now close attention to health and fitness coupled with an aggressive savings/investment plan shall be enforced.  The logistical infrastructure that was so unknown to me in the relationship prior will be facilitated. I will never be happy living paycheck to paycheck, dear reader. I am advancing now to the point in my career where I will have to leave the barracks in exchange from civilian accommodation. In lay man's terms:  " They're kickin' me out" . It will be a modest apartment furnished in wares from Ikea. Recalling a time when I considered purchasing a thirty-two hundred dollar illuminated manuscript for display in my room, it is obvious that I've come a long way. Please do not misunderstand me, I won't live cheap, just with a careful eye on wastefulness. I will have a small collection of fine things.  1. Three bottles of wine (white,red,port) 2. A small humidor (with a dozen cigars) 3. Antique straight razor (with shaving soap) 4. Ralph Lauren sheets (600 threat count)  Why should one concern himself with material possessions and financial security, fictional reader? Because It's all I can do for now. I have to put the best foot forward possible before I will ever again attempt to find the one for me. So yes this is pathetic and basic, but necessary just the same. It is early on  FOB:Marez . Allah's crescent moon is drawing to a close and soon Mosul's imams will croon the call that beckons Islam's faithful to morning prayer. I shall retire the metal box I call home. Here is absent the Hovertrek Home Exerbike or free standing lamps from $49.50 but it's for the time being it is where I rest my head.  " You are my home. " - The Scarlet Pimpernel

      The days are long and sweltering now on  FOB:Marez , fictional reader. My concerns should number among the priorities of any professional NCO and they do, but of course everyone's mind wanders from time to time. It's not  al iraqee jundee ,or the dead we've buried,or even to fantasize of arbitrary and gratuitous sexual intercourse. For your author it is a song from  The Sims . Please allow me to elaborate before dismissing this as idle banter.  This particular song accompanies the menu that appears when purchasing furniture for your electronic counterpart. It is a very subtle yet upbeat tune reminiscent of a circa 1950's television advertisement in which the dutiful housewife chooses brand A over brand B. The piece is quite enjoyable and leaves an air of prosperous stability that one can only presume comes with accessorizing a home. How envious I am of family men, dearest reader. How often I find myself seeking their advice these days.  Please do not misunderstand the intent here. There was a time when I felt marriage would herald the end of all masculine freedoms, however seeing this is not the case am now left with a longing for home and hearth. Devotion and duty are simple. It is a matter of picking one's path and walking it to the end, no matter what. I've sworn allegiance to many things in my life, to God, to family,and to country. It is the progression of those devotions that are now sought. I want to grow as a Christian, start a family of my own, and of course, be a good American. It is acceptable to want what everyone else wants, a good life.

      I again have little time to write. It's been another great day of training  al iraqee jundee.   I was talking to SSG Wally today about marriage, no fictional reader, not to him, just in general. It's a good thing, that I am more then ready for. Now if I could just find some nice lady to say yes. She doesn't have to be real pretty or even really that smart. I don't care if she has views on Kurdistan ( my growing pet-political issue ). She doesn't have to be pious or any of the bullshit I claim I'm looking for. I'm just looking for a good woman. I can marry a liberal Jew with her head in the clouds, so long as her heart is good, fuck it. I'd like that to be Adrienne. I do love her after all. But if it's not to be I'm not going to spend my life pining for her like some iconoclastic fool. I chose to live, fictional reader.   I would so like to publish another post on this site with some merit but my job keeps me busy. I would like to address the following issues and shall in time.  1. The futility of surprise Vice-presidential picks. 2. Tactical definition of the War on Terror. 3. That fucking song from the Sims 4. Assorted notable nothings 5. Why French MTV is better then American MTV  Things are great. My Arabic is improving daily. Kate is sad and lonely while she's deployed, I wrote her a quick letter to say hello. I need to shower so I close. I am very happy and I'm doing it alone. Oh yes, by the way if anyone is reading this and would like to send me a bootleg copy of the OBC  Rent . I would really appreciate it. While I've already purchased two copies in this lifetime a third would just be wasteful so hint hint *ahem* Kristen.

      I don't have much time to write. Just letting you know I'm doing better. It's amazing how much some sleep a good diet and a great day of training haji can make you feel. I'm getting along without her fictional reader. I don't need her to know I made it through a battle, or that I'm sad, or lonely. Of course I want these things, but don't  need  them. Time will come when I am ready to be a good man to her and then it'll be her choice and ultimately her loss.   Vote Bush 2004 !

      I do feel these sentiments fall on deaf ears. Today I feel defeated as I have these past few days, so shall nothing to alienate those who truly care for me. Yes, she is gone and should have to live with that for all my years. So I again break from these conversations, dearest fictional reader and take short leave. Do not think ill of me. I am just too sad to produce anything to worth as of now.  I guess that's life.

      Brando is dead, fictional reader. Coincidentally I was watching  The Godfather   today after our morning mission. I enjoy the scene when Michael returns from Sicily and persuades Kay to marry him. He kinda saunters down the street with her moving his feet is a circular motion as he walks, like a little boy. I always think of her when I see that scene. I'm not particularly moved when men die as octogenarians. Brando has a good life and made many people happy, so he was blessed.  Just hope Tessio doesn't try and whack me now.  or  If I could only stop blogging.

      It occurs to me that it has now been fifteen days since she last broke my heart. In the past I would have made advances to interject in her life with additional grovelings. I wonder if I have progressed, or if I am too busy to be hurt. While yes, she is always on my mind I will do nothing to break her new found freedom. It's by my misery that she has purchased joy. As I've said home is just a few months away and I think of Christmas in the city, hands interlaced with hers. I think of wool coats dotted with snow and of holding her on crowded trains and subway cars. I think of the disappointment that will be store when these things do not come true. For now dreams are my parachute, they break the fall as I plummet once more, to an emotional disaster.   " Hope is not a course of action. " - LTC Buck James

      So following a small lunch my fervor has cooled. Being that as it may I should impart to you the latest busy nothings in my life:  1. I've been temporarily reassigned as liaison/instructor for the Iraq National guard training here on FOB:Marez. While I relsish the chance for father cultural exploration and language proficiency the absence of my men will make me worried and sad. Though it will be difficult I will moonlight on night missions and instruct during the day. Hard as it may be I'd gladly sacrifice sleep to be with my guys.   2. The Greek paper is done and you guessed it, I'm studying the Romans. A paper shall be produced and submitted by the afternoon of the 4th. This will leave me ten days to read the next selection and again submit a paper. I feel like I finally have my head above water again.  3. I do so miss her.   4. I plan on calling my father this weekend to see how he is and seek his guidance. If all goes well I will need him once again to act as my proxy in registration for my next class. While it's still early I've ruled out a double-major. You really end up not knowing shit about either subject. For a additional 33 credits, which can be offset by a major I can be awarded an additional degree.   5. I have befriended Doc. He was inspiration for the prior smattering of history and politics. He is fourteen years my senior and savvy in political thinking. He is a welcome relief from these idiots. He also hates MM Which is of course welcome in my camp.  It's time to head off to the gym. I still have a lot of training to do If I want to be a tough-guy SF operator. Lists can be fun, no?

      Consider the Romans when feeling even the least bit sorry for our civilization, fictional reader. One of the quintessential pitfalls of colonialism is the incorporation of a multinational factions under a single banner owing allegiance to a single sovereign. In first century BCE Roman foreign policy was dictated by conquest. By either retaliatory or preemptive strikes the empire acquired vast tracks of land in war. No thought was ever wasted on the management of this new culturally diverse nation.   Britain learned this lesson well during their administration of the divided Ottoman Empire following World War I. It is the basis for the many cultural and political divides that plagues the middle east today. The establishment of Palestine and the absolution of Kurdistan are good examples of this. But here in lies the fundamental difference within the United States, the reason that gives such a bright promise for the future. Our nation was born in the waxing age of colonialism. As a neonatal and revolutionary state America was unable to adopt the same policy of the dominate superpowers seated in the old world.   This set the precedence for America to tread lightly in their formative years. Lands gained in conquest were minimal while lands purchased though the early nineteenth century CE helped fit the growing national ideal of "Manifest Destiny." The United States developed a civilization based on an idealistic and moral blueprint much as revolutionary and federalist documents had codified our desire to gel as a nation at the close of the eighteenth century CE. As such we are the first nation ever to do so, there is so little known of the true democracy that we are reinventing daily.   How blessed we are dear reader. That every person, so long as they are a citizen and of age can exercise political authority by choosing who leads them in these turbulent times. Every man and woman is a faction, either by decision or indecision, you very citizenship is the demonstration of political authority and please I pray you, use it wisely. Don't be as the Romans who acted in haste. It is our nation's time to shine and we it's daughters and sons are heirs to a system of government perfected by the mistakes of antiquity. They say the best times are behind us. This is not true; they are just around the corner, so please keep the faith, my dearest reader.   Mr. Moore, make all the films you wish and scream as loud as you can, for I will do the same.

      I attended a Purple Heart ceremony today, fictional reader. It wasn't the first and I'm afraid won't be the last. It's always good to see men walk away from wounds, even if they are mostly nicks and scratches. Today was the twenty-third such award pinned on a man from Blackhawk company. It's an honor I'm glad is not mine. The last thing my father told me as I left the door for basic was " Don't come home with any purple hearts or medals of honor, they can prove lethal." He wasn't kidding, and he certainly wasn't wrong.  His best friend Tom Noonan was killed in action 5 February 1967 in Vietnam, in a reverse slope ambush. He was a marine who idolized John Wayne and was noted as once devouring an eight pound ham in one sitting and when he entered a pizza parlor, he would tell them " don't cut it, just fold it." He spent most of the year as a high school gym teacher in an all girls academy, but when the war came, he couldn't be held back. He told friends he thought he would never come home, and was right. He too was awarded the purple heart and congressional medal of honor for conspicuous gallantry in the face of the enemy. My father misses him very much.  But that's the butcher's bill, dear reader. It's a dice roll, sometimes you're lucky and walk away with a little sting and sometimes you're cut down in the prime of your life. Smitty and XO are resting this very moment in Walter Reed. Despite devastating wounds they'll live. I guess that's all anyone can really ask for, isn't it?

      I couldn't sleep and currently I have another post still in draft that I came to peck away at, but alas, cannot find the words tonight. I don't worry too much, blogging is a hobby, not a calling. Why do we spend so much time devoted to deciphering our calling? Shouldn't God just leave us a instruction manual when we are birthed? (Yes, Yes, I know he has.) Anyway, I close my eyes and think of her or at times fighting. I'd never seen anything quite like the action on the fourth. It's funny how life experiences dwarf themselves. Just a few weeks ago I thought I'd seen the most I'd ever see. Then the next thing, then the next and on and on....  Last night I once again dreamt of her, I didn't like what I saw, but we don't get choices in these things, do we fictional reader? It has been brought to my attention that I wronged her in a fashion that was unknown to me, and has been recently remedied. I hope it has not caused too much disruption to her. My eyes grow heavy, so I call it a night.   *yawns*

      I could attempt to use an epic word to describe yesterday's action, but will as always say little of the fighting. It took many hours to seize the ground from the enemy as they brought everything they could down on us, RPGs, automatic fire, and even mortars. The morning after is always an eggshell day, being careful not settle down, as once again the world may erupt in violence. I guess that's like that for anyone's life. We achieve, we survive, we love, and we hope that it all doesn't come crashing down on top of us. I'd like to say yesterday will be the last time the good citizens of Mousl will have their world turned on it's head, but this is not true. Peace like all things good and bad lasts as long as it can.  What should I say about Adrienne that you do not already know? She is back in my life again, albeit in some limited fashion and on her own terms. She could be gone again tomorrow but Friendship is a valued thing, fictional reader. She cannot reciprocate what I hold in my heart. Regardless, I remain as always, loyal. I do so wish for many things: a wife and child, a home, an education, and a good career. But for now my head still hurts from fighting and I really haven't thought about these things too much during the past week. Here on  FOB: Marez  we're just counting the days till we come home, and doing our best not to die. War is such a distraction.   urlLink   Marty     : No no no, I went the other road.

      I watched a man die last night, and that sort of thing is never easy, fictional reader. He was cut down in a hail of bullets before I could bring my weapon to train, and as such stood voyeur to the slaughter. That's life in the streets, action to reaction and back again. The dead never look real, possessing more the visage of wax figurines then the shell of departed souls. Lopez and I fumbled with the body bag in the dark. Fresh dead are supple, making them easy to care for. Initially I wanted only to secure the AK-47 and leave the body behind, but was ordered otherwise. Once he was loaded I grabbed the sandals and scarf which shook off him as he was riddled by fire, placed them at his feet, and zip the bag shut. The glory hounds who claim to love death but who took no part in the shooting were quick to scoop him up victoriously.  Recalling the seventh corporal work of mercy,  bury the dead,  I felt ashamed. It is a Christian's duty to care for the deceased, not leave them like trash in the streets. Soldiers often make jokes after they have killed, however physically confronting the fruits of one's horrific labor often requires such devices. The man made a sacrifice for his way of life, whose contestation occurs nightly. Soldiers die in war and this is inevitable, fictional reader. The act itself does not move me to regret, after all he was the aggressor, not we. It was my conduct following said event that stood as disappointment. If one must murder for political gain one should at least have the decency to clean up afterwards. The dead deserve more then we have given them, but I am new to war, so have forgiven myself.

      There's a girl I talk to on a semi-regular basis who's preparing to deploy here in just a few weeks. In speaking to her today, she had to rush off to finish packing her things. As I've been laying in bed for the past two hours listening to Nora Jones'  Hotel Room Paper  and Toby Keith's  Shockin' Y'all  my thoughts wonder to those nine boxes in storage. For the life of me fictional reader, I have no fucking clue what's in them. Obviously many of the possessions stored therein are non essential, as I've done without these things for many months now and am alive and kicking.  There are books along with the many keepsakes amassed from my time with Adrienne that I could not bring myself to part with so readily. Clothes, Knick-Knacks, and all the barracks-ratish accoutrements I feel must be let go, so that this time maybe my life can be summed up in only four boxes. Why do we humans horde such trivial things in our lifetimes? I myself am not one day returned home and already find myself plotting to spend my hard earn dollars on new nothings to replace my obsolete nothings of yesteryear. It is not a sin to amass wealth and possessions. It is when these things rule our lives do we cross boundaries into the realm of insanity.  Why am I still awake you might ask, dearest reader? The answer is simple, unprofessionalim. Here is a small lesson for you, should you ever find yourself a sergeant in the American Army. When you realize that a guard roster must be generated for the following day's duty, do yourself a small favor. Be proactive and do it yourself. Do not knock on Sgt. Andrews' door and ask him to do it for you. He will in the end not like you for it and tell you unceremonious and much less cordially then you had expected, to fuck off. That being said, I believe I shall make a second attempt to crawl into bed and sleep. As always I pray and perhaps selfishly hope to dream of her. But these are the private things I share with you and no other dear reader.   urlLink   Tyler Durden     : We're consumers. We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession. Murder, crime, poverty, these things don't concern me. What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra.    urlLink   Narrator     : Martha Stewart.     urlLink   Tyler Durden     : Fuck Martha Stewart. Martha's polishing the brass on the Titanic. It's all going down, man. So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.

      When I dream of her I am always grateful , dear reader. The nice ones are always the hardest to wake up from. This morning when I awoke there was made a futile attempt to return to sleep and resume where we had left off. It's good to run into old friends, even if they are no longer real to you, as you are unreal to them. This gets harder by the day, not easier as I thought it would be by now. But that's life, sometimes you just can't go back to sleep. I should have access to the net for most of the day, but really don't have much else to say aside from these little quips in passing.  I hope she enjoys her weekend. Mine is...well, I'm here.
