       Today was my first day of being officially unemployed.  Had to wake up around 10 to run errands, then wound up heading to the city to hang around with a few folks.  Jonas and I wanted to tour a few ships during this fleet week, but the uppity security made lines to get on ships insanely long, so we opted out.  We met up with Micky and some of his friends for sushi.    After a good and spicy few rolls, we parted ways.  Jonas and I walked by the Mormon temple up on Columbus in the 60's, and it was open to the public for tours.  When else in my life will I ever get to see a Mormon temple without accepting Jesus Christ as my lord and savior?  The guide said the tour was formal, so Jonas decided to opt out.  The irony was not lost on either of us, that a Jewish kid from Wisconsin and an Ismaili Muslim from Long Island were standing in the NYC Mormon Temple.    The tour guide was an Asian dude who spoke very quietly and with a heavy accent.  That wiped out my first stereotype about the Mormons (that they were all white).  So after having to sit through a 15 minute video about the history of Mormons and Mormon Temples, we had to slip these plastic booties over our shoes (they said it was just to protect the carpeting, but I don't know if that's the whole reason though).  We toured the Temple, and I have to say that it is an extremely remarkable structure.  The first thing we saw is the baptismal Font, which has three huge statues of Oxen on each side (representing the 12 tribes of Israel).  I thought it looked like a jacuzzi without the jets.  I admit I did picture myself relaxing in the pool, preferably with a cold drink in my hand (I don't think the Mormons would appreciate that thought though).    But the rooms of the Temple are beautifully decorated and designed.  Most have fresh flowers and very pleasant lighting.  The Temple has carvings of beehives all over the place, which is supposed to symbolize the work and commitment that goes into their community.  But what really struck me is that they didn't have a big central congregation hall.  It was more like a series of smaller rooms, all beautifully decorated.  The guide kept saying it was designed to feel the presence of God and all that, and I could definitely see what he was talking about.  But I didn't feel holy in that place.  It reminded me more of a very beautiful wedding chapel (which I guess is intentional, since marriage is a huge part of their faith), very earthly and paradisical, but not spiritual.  But I could definitely see how others could feel peaceful and spiritual in that place.  Kudos to the Mormons.    In the end, they gave us free cookies!  In the end, it was apparent that the Mormons are an extremely wealthy community who like to reinvest their wealth into their Temples and communities.  That's absolutely amazing that they do that and keep humble about it.  All the Mormons I met there were very enthusiastic about their faith, but extremely nice people.  Got a lot of polite smiles and greetings.  They're a good group, all the best to them.  I'm pretty happy being an Ismaili though, so no plans of conversion... But I do see no problem in learning and appreciating others.

       So today was my last day of work.  Judging as it's the Friday before a long weekend, there were very few people in the office.  Not bad though, just relaxed and said my goodbyes to everyone there.  So after the sentimental farewells, got to watch a lightning storm from my boss' office, then got on the last Path ride home.  That's when the fun began.    While walking towards the front of the train car, I felt something hit my foot.  Some freaky freaky eating a box of McNuggets thought it would be a good idea to toss an open container of barbecue sauce at my shoe.  I just got those damned things polished too.  So the strange thing who threw the sauce at me wasn't making eye contact, I couldn't even tell if it was a guy or a girl.  Androgenous and drugged out or something.  So instead of making a fuss, I just gave a dirty look then walked away, cleaned off my shoe and stood there quietly.  But apparantly some lady next to me didn't want it to end that quickly.  She started a fuss, called the conductor, and said, "That one right there threw barbecue sauce at this man's shoe."  The conductor then said to me, "Do you want to press charges?"  I passed it up.  Why bother making a bigger fuss?  The same lady making a fuss then continued, saying things to the sauce tosser like "It was a mistake you were born" and "don't be mad at the world, be mad at the ones who created you."  Threats flew between them, the conductor came in again, asked her if she wanted to press charges, the whole 9 yards.  The freaky freaky sauce tosser wound up sneaking out of the train at Christopher street, never to be heard from again.  The conductor even said, "That was assault throwing the sauce at you.  We could've taken (him/her/it) away in cuffs if you wanted to press charges."  I wouldn't exactly want to remember my last day of work as the day when I got a crazy person incarcerated.  (*note:  All quoted dialogue above is approximate, and should be read with an inner city accent).    So I came home, went for Jamati services, now I'm being lazy at home.  I found out our family friend went into labor last night, gave birth to a beautiful baby girl this morning.  Z (cutest little kid ever, see picture below on the May 22 post), now has a baby sister.  So a sauce tosser avoided arrest, I got my freedom from the constraintts of employment and a beautiful baby girl was born.  So this day was a good one after all.

       "02 trips remaining" is what the Path turnstile read this morning as I entered.  Tomorrow is my last commute to Jersey via the Path, and I'm really going to miss those shady, overcrowded and dirty trains.    It's strange, every weekday morning I walk by the construction zone at ground zero heading to the train platforms.  At first, it was pretty solemn.  It is, afterall, the site of a mass killing.  But the more I walked by there, the more I realized the increasing numbers of tourists there to gawk and take pictures.  It's just nauseating.  There is usually a group of Asian people there taking pictures with a wide grin in front of the site.  Asian tourists like to do that, they always take pictures by themselves in front of a monument or something, with their hands at their sides.  Kind of like this guy:  urlLink    The Asian Pose&nbsp; urlLink     It's very peculiar.  When it's not a group of Asians, it's usually a group of Southerners or Midwesterners seeing New York for the first time.  I have a feeling that their paying tribute is undoubtedly followed by a lot of jingoism and praise for Bush.    So today at work wasn't bad.  I spoke to a lot of folks, and I have to say that I really did work with a good group of people.  Luckily I'm leaving on good terms.  If I'm going to law school, it certainly doesn't hurt to stay in touch with people in the legal profession.

       On the subway this morning, I ran into a girl I knew from NYU.  This is the second time I ran into her on the subway.  She's a tall (and pretty cute) Bengali girl.  We lived in the same dorm freshman year, and for second semester I loaned her my books from  Conversations of the West, never to get them back (not like I read them either.)  I don't have much use for a Study Bible at this point in my life anyway.  I hadn't seen her for many years, then last month sometime I ran into her on the Subway.  We were standing next to eachother, then finally I had the courage to ask the obvious 'let's acknowledge that we know eachother' line of "Didn't you go to NYU?"  When I ran into her this morning it was more cordial, and we even wound up swapping numbers and email addresses.  So I potentially made a new old friend (I acknowledge the irony).  She's probably heading to film school next year, and it's always fun to have artsy friends.    At work, some of the attorneys were a little worked up about one particular case.  The attorneys brought in some papers to my office and asked me to hand deliver them to another guy at a firm down the street.  They were laughing, telling me to watch for the look on the guy's face once he gets the papers.  When I delivered them, the guy seemed to angrily tear open the envelope... I could tell he was pissed off when he saw our firm name on it.  Funny, how even laywers in suits can get guilty pleasures from taking swings at their gang rivals.    Speaking of, I heard today that the Bloods and Crips and a bunch of other gangs signed a 'ceasefire' agreement in Newark.  Nice to know that Newark is making better progress than Najaf.  Now I feel safer in the city where I work and never go outside.  When working in downtown Newark, after getting off the train, you never have to go outside to get to the Legal Center or the Gateway Centers.  In all my time working, the only time I went outside was to get my notary commission at the court house.  It's funny how the place turns from posh office highrise into total Ghetto within a 12 inch walk.  Three days of work left.

       So today was my last Monday as a Bankruptcy Paralegal.  Lucky me, I made a commitment to be a juror at a mock trial somewhere in Jersey after work, completely forgetting that I bought a ticket to see some indie flick with my sister about South Asians in Britain.  The mock trial was a really boring personal liability case.  The training attorneys had no charisma nor any organizational skills.  It was actually quite funny to watch at times.    The problem is that when we were deliberating, I was the one who looked like a cheapskate.  I thought a $50,000 settlement would be more than enough.  Some jokers wanted to award $500,000.  Ugh... just because some old lady falls down a stair (not a flight of stairs, she missed  one  step and slipped), some idiot wants to give her a half million?  It looks like the farce our justice system has become has even penetrated the mock levels.    So other than that, my dad drove me to Brooklyn this morning from home in Long Island.  On the way, he had to stop at the hospital and see one patient, so I went with him.  While he was inside seeing the patient, I had a conversation with the lady custodian cleaning up the hallway.  She was an Indian woman no taller than 4'5.  She said she came from Kerala.  I could barely understand what she was saying, but all I know is that it was about how she's working so her teenage children can one day go to college, and some story about how her son is good with electronics and fixed up a DVD player that someone had thrown out.  She was living the American dream.  The interesting part is that after that, she topped off the conversation by telling me that the war in Iraq is completely pointless, and that she really loved Bill Clinton despite his philandering.  She topped even that by saying, "Men are better leaders than women."  That really came out of nowhere, but it was interesting nonetheless.  Two cultures colliding together to form the American dream, plus a really funny, but ironically honest and valid, political opinion.  She realized something simple but important...  Bush is trying to kill the American dream.

        urlLink    Sophia and Z.  Z's the cutest little girl ever.  &nbsp; urlLink     The above picture is of my sister, Sophia, at home with our family friend's daugher, I'll call her Z.  Z's the cutest little kid ever.  While I was in Brooklyn Heights earlier today, there were a bunch of people walking around with their little kids.  A lot of them were really cute.  I want to have a little daughter one day.  Last week I was talking about the concept of parents and children with my parents and some other people.  Fathers always have a soft spot for their daughters, while mothers have it for the sons.    Ok, I'll stop being such a loser.  Enjoy the picture.

       I had to wake up at 9 a.m. on the dot becasue the exterminator was coming.  The guy spent all of 2 minutes in my apartment putting some pesticide gel all over the place.  He said there used to be some people who lived until recently down in the hall in 9K who had garbage piled waist high.  He said it was literally the most disgusting situation he'd ever seen.  I guess after they were booted the roaches spread out.  Hopefully I'll never see one around here again.   I spent most of the day in Brooklyn Heights with a friend who just finished her first year at Brooklyn Law.  She's always depressed about something.  But it wasn't bad spending a few hours reading at Starbucks, outside absorbing the nice weather.  Is it me or are all law students morbidly distraught?    So I spent a few hours reading Timeout New York, and they had a review about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban:  "Young Harry's third celluloid adventure is the best of the bunch.  New director Alfonso Cuaron brings a more tangible sense of menace, tension and struggle, along with the expected visual wizardry.  The cast is a who's who of British stalwarts, and yes,  Hermione is growing up nicely ."  The last line reminded me of one of my friends, let's call him Sag.  He's wanted to hit up Emma Watson since the first Harry Potter flick.  He's a sick f**k, but he's a funny sick f**k, so it's ok.  But it's strange to see the kids of Harry Potter growing up.  Emma Watson doesn't look like a little girl anymore, and many people are starting to make lewd comments.    The girl just turned 14 last month, so the guys making lewd comments should realize they're still acting like pedophiles, regardless of how much she's grown.    So tonight I'm hanging around with a bunch of folks.  Don't feel like doing anything too much.   Maybe we'll just go play pool or something. We havn't done that as a group ever.  Hopefully it'll be fun just mellowing out together tonight.  I'm getting really bored of going out to bars or whatever.  Hanging around together and being lazy is a highly under appreciated activity.

       I went to go see Godzilla with Martin last night.  I think it's funny how the Japanese pronounce it 'Go-jilla."  But the movie was fun nonetheless.  I learned that in the American version, they took most of the old movie and spliced Hollywood shot sequences into it, all the while cutting out the satirical elements.  So Hollywood's dumbing down of cultural mediums is nothing new.    Today at work, some friends from the Immigration and Corporate groups took me out to lunch to wish me a farewell.  We went over to Fornos, about a 5-10 minute walk from our building in Newark.  The restaurant was a lot nicer than I expected.  Zainab, the Pakistani girl who works in Corporate, was opinionated as usual.  She's a really interesting character.  We always have little mock skirmishes about India-Pakistan and whatever else, but in the end, she and I relate to one another better than most others at the office.  For some reason, she's always pissed off at someone or something.  Luckily I havn't managed to cross her the wrong way.  I think it's culture shock.  She doesn't fully understand American culture, nor does she feel comfortable here.  She's such a smart woman, but gets written off pretty easily because of her accent or whatever... hell, she did go to Law School.  I guess that's enough to annoy most anyone.  Plus I doubt her husband is happy here.  They're also a little worried about raising their 2 year old here in the states, thinking that he'll be treated like a foreigner the rest of his life.  I can realte to that, growing up on Long Island, there was no shortage of dickheaded elementary school kids calling me 'Ghandi' or whatever the hell else... ignore the fact that I'm American born.  Eric, one of her officemates, made some dumbass comment and crossed a line somewhere.  I think it was when he jokingly said, 'Curse Allah' or something like that.  I politely and privately told him that he should be careful, especially around Zainab.  She finds it offensive and is pretty sensitive to the whole anti-Islamic trend that's becomming more mainstream.    So after taking a 2.5 hour lunch break, I went back to the office and passed the time.  Only 5 workdays left.  After work I went to Jamatkhana for services.  They had some members of the national council in town, and surprisingly, had a really great discussion session after.  Talked mainly about portraying the soft and intellectual face of Islam and Ismailism.  I'm pretty glad to be Ismaili.  We (realtively) have our stuff together here in the states.    The ex called me and left a message again today.  She mentioned she's having a birthday party the first week of June, and I really don't feel like going.  I know she'll be annoying if I skip it again, like last year.  Hopefully I can bring along a friend to keep me company.  She's such a weird case.  When we were together, she got to know me better than most other people ever have.  So it's nice to have a conversation with her every once in a while.  But the past 2 years or so have changed me tremendously.  I don't think she knows the Zahir of 2004 as well as she did Zahir of 2002.  Every time we talk, she either says something really meaningful or something really annoying.  I'm sure I'm going to rant more about her the more I write.

       So after putting it off for god knows how many months, I've finally decided to start a blog.  All the cool kids were doing it, so why shouldn't I?  I was heading home yesterday with my sister, when she mentioned she was going to start a blog.  So why the hell not.    I have exactly 6 workdays left until unemployment.  I have mixed feelings about leaving.  I can't believe that I've been working  urlLink there  for over a year.  By far the longest job I ever held.  It certainly didn't suck as much as working in the restaurant biz.  If anything, being forced to wear business casual did instill some degree of self worth.  I can't complain too much, I did have a relatively good ride this past year.  Jack and Andrew (the two partners in the Bankruptcy group) treated me very well.  Andrew took me and a few others out for my farewell lunch yesterday (Wednesday).  We went for Indian food. For a white guy, Andrew has a good tolerance for spicy food.  I also could have done without the other white guys trying to imitate the Indian accent.  They never do it right.  It's always this cartoony and idiotic sounding voice.  At least Apu from the Simpsons is half decent, these other guys are just bad at doing it.  People should leave the racial imitations to people of their respective race.    I'm training a guy named Pete to take over for me in the Bankruptcy group.  He's a really nice guy, seems to be the type who gets along with everyone.  He's probably in his 40's.  The guy was a stock trader with Drexel Burnham during the 80's, then with Prudential later.  After 9/11, he left finance.  Why the hell he decided to become a peon in the law firm is beyond me.    Anyway, I'm tired.  Went to go see the originaly version of Godzilla tonight at the Film Forum.  Funny, cheesy, charming.  Better than the crap Hollywood managed to turn it into.  More later.

       So after a restful week, I'm finally packing my stuff to head over to camp tomorrow morning.  So for one month, I'll be held virtually incommunicado with the outside world.  I have to surrender my cellphone and wallet once I get there.  They figure if people have their phones, it would be a distraction and keep them from mingling and making friends there.  I see their point, but I feel virtually naked without a cellphone and wallet.    Other than that, I hit up Great Adventure earlier this week.  This week was the perfect time to go, virtually no crowds at all.  We got to go on every single roller coaster we wanted to, (except Viper, which was shut down).  The longest line was about 20 minutes.  I love how the commercials say "Just minutes away from the city"... yeah, like 120 minutes.  The designers got a little lazy... the area with the 'Frontier' and old west theme now houses the Medussa rollercoaster.  The coaster there before Medussa had an abandoned mine theme, and they were too lazy to rip all that down.  So Medussa, with its ancient greek iconography, is combined with an old west theme.  The sign literally says, "Medussa" in crazy purple and green script, and right beneath is the old west sign in black and white reading, "Mining Company."  Seriously, how lazy can you get?    I had to wake up really early this morning to drop my sister off at the airport.  Today was Chandraat (new moon), which coincided with Friday.  So keeping with Ismaili tradition, I fasted from 6 am to 6 pm.  That wasn't too bad, but I was cleaning stuff out of my garage at around 6 am.  The problem is that the work made me really thirsty, since by 6 it was already in the 80's.  And being the genius that I am, I found my old bike.  I dusted it off, and took a ride around the block.  That didn't help the thirst situation at all.  So I squirmed a little, but the fast was doable.  After clearing some more garbage from the garage, I went back to sleep until around 11.    Until next month...

       So I came back from vacation on Thursday.  Spent a few days in Puerto Rico with my family, lounging around on the beach, getting rest, playing a little roulette at the casino, and touring around a little.  It's the last family vacation we're probably ever going to go on.  After this, it's school, work and all the other crap.  So Puerto Rico was good.    On the way back from Puerto Rico, the gate was filled with a bunch of kids all between the ages of 13 and 15 and wearing blue t-shirts.  They were part of some youth band coming up to NY for the Puerto Rico day parade.  They were loud.  The gate agent went on the speaker and spoke in Spanish to a loud 'Yeahhhhh' by the band.  When the plane landed at JFK, the pilot went on the intercom speaking quickly in Spanish, ending it with 'Boriqua' sending the band wild with cheers.  They like to have their fun.    So yesterday was the big barbecue in Madison Park in NYC.  The lines totally sucked, but the food was very good.  If only they had more stations that didn't serve pork, it would have been better.  So I hung around with the folks, ate a lot of food, and walked around to Union Square with some friends.  They had some folks from a pet adoption organization walking around with dogs and puppies, even had some cats in cages, showing off their animals for adoption.  One guy asked how much one of the dogs cost, and the guy holding the leash, in a very contemptous voice, replied "We are not a pet store.  These animals are up for adoption."    Later met up with Joyce, who recently got back from a trip to Beirut.  She brought me back a mini hookah that's totally awsome.  Spent some time at Cafe Esperanto, on Macdougal Street.  That place reminds me of Central Perk, from Friends, but less gay.  Now I'm getting stuff prepared for Al Ummah.  I'm leaving in less than a week.  Looking forward to it, it's going to be a long slog.  Hopefully it's fun.

       While browsing the web the other day, I came across this link to a site with  urlLink pictures taken in Iraq , probably by soldiers serving in combat.  They're a far cry from the garbage Fox news and all the other tv networks like to broadcast, trying to show everyone that everything is hunky dory over in land of dreams.  Well, it's not a nice dream, it's quite nightmarish.  So those burned children are what they mean when they say 'collateral damage' and 'civilian casualties.'  Luckily we found all those weapons of mass destruction so the terrorist can't get them, and established a pro-American democracy so the entire region can turn toward a brighter future... oh wait.    Other than that, it looks like Michael Moore released the  urlLink trailer for Farenheit 911 .  I have mixed feelings about Moore.  I enjoy his work, but I don't necessarily agree with him all of the time.  Bowling for Columbine was wonderful in commentating on the culture of fear in America, but then went overboard and became mindless and petty.  I hope he doesn't do the same thing in this movie.  It looks like a typical Michael Moore documentary from the looks of it.  In the end, Moore is just trying to protect the little guy.    Well, I went with my family earlier this week to see our friends newborn baby.  She's so tiny and adorable.  Her 3 year old sister was being very playful though.  She had a little hair brush and insisted on giving me a new hairstyle.  She was insistent that I would look like Shahrukh Khan when she was done.

       Time keeps going forward, so I guess it was inevitable that the pendulum swings back the other way.&nbsp; I was having a really crappy week, but today seemed a bit better.&nbsp; I wasn't feeling as lousy as I have been for a while.&nbsp;   So I had a long talk with my parents the other night about a lot of stuff.&nbsp; Some shouting, some talking, a lot of emotions.&nbsp;&nbsp; They noticed I was being withdrawn and quiet, not wanting to say anything at all.&nbsp; They wanted to know if I was ok.&nbsp; So we talked.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel like it's pointless trying to explain my thoughts to my dad.&nbsp; He either takes offense, or tries to show me another point of view.&nbsp; My mom, on the other hand, understands me far better.&nbsp; In terms of the way our minds work, she and I are far more similar than me and my dad.&nbsp; I guess I needed that.&nbsp;   I'm not feeling as angry at my sister as I was.&nbsp; Still haven't talked to her in a bit, but I'm not angry anymore.&nbsp; I have no idea where that anger came from.&nbsp; Part of it is her manner of speaking.&nbsp; She embodies every pet peeve I have when she speaks to me.&nbsp; People have said in the past how I somehow get angry when she's speaking, even if it's about something non-offensive.&nbsp; But in the end, she's done quite a bit for me.&nbsp; How are you supposed to react to genuinely cares about you, but pushes your anger buttons at the same time?&nbsp; I guess that's typical sibling dynamics, and in my increasing bi-polarity, I guess it was just the pendulum swinging one way.&nbsp;   On a better note, I got to hang around with Seema today.&nbsp; She's great.&nbsp; The type of friends who I can not be in touch with for nearly months on end, then meet up with her and catch up without missing a beat.&nbsp; We hung around at the Barnes & Noble with the Starbucks attached.&nbsp; B&N is a highly underrated hangout spot (for the truly geeky at heart, like myself).&nbsp;   So now that I'm doing a bit better, I just hope that the pendulum doesn't swing back into the negative direction too badly.&nbsp;

       Today was one of the most quiet days I've had in a long time.&nbsp; Quiet in the sense that I barely said a word today.&nbsp; For some reason, I really didn't feel like speaking to anyone or saying anything.&nbsp; Before AU, one of my favorite things to do was walk around and collect my thoughts.&nbsp; I told people before how you start to figure out strange things about yourself when you are left alone with nothing but your thoughts.&nbsp; I used to go for long walks, usually over the Brooklyn bridge, and just think.&nbsp; This morning, I had to go to my dad's new office to do some data entry.&nbsp; I decided to walk the few miles to Grand Army Plaza, and started thinking about stuff (mainly about how I can't wait to get the hell out of here).&nbsp;   There were a lot of nice looking women walking about.&nbsp; Most are shaped like hourglasses.&nbsp; I think there's a reason for it.&nbsp; Our time on this planet is limited.&nbsp; I need to get my act together and start moving.&nbsp; Women are a constant reminder of that.&nbsp;   So I did nothing tonight besides watch some British flicks on IFC.&nbsp; Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrells and Trainspotting (two of my favs).&nbsp; Some friends went to AC, I wish I could've gone with them.&nbsp; But tomorrow is the regional dandia, and for some reason, I really want to go.&nbsp; So tonight was lonely and somewhat depressing.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's nothing better than topping off a depressing night with a movie about herion addicts.&nbsp;   It's strange, at the end of AU, I felt like a new person.&nbsp; For the past few days, I feel like I'm slipping back into the old me, and it doesn't feel good at all.&nbsp; Just another few weeks before my clean slate.&nbsp; I'll be surrounded by new people with plenty of opportunities to make new friends.&nbsp; Probably the last time in my life I'll have an opportunity like this, so I better not blow it.&nbsp;

       After getting back from Al Ummah, I spent the week sitting on my ass being bitter about being home.&nbsp; It was so strange suddenly going from a heavily packed schedule with something to do almost every minute, to having nothing to do at all.&nbsp; So I spent a lot of time at the mechanic's garage getting all of our cars serviced.&nbsp; Then went home and felt like pulling my hair out because of the severe boredom.&nbsp; So yesterday, I finally came back to Brooklyn and went out with some friends.&nbsp; It was great seeing the crew again.&nbsp; It felt like I've been away for years.&nbsp; Sue's mystery man was in town, and he seemed really cool.&nbsp; He has this awsome South African accent (which is the second coolest accent, next to the Scottish one).&nbsp;   One of the weirdest things about being back is that I'm not really in contact with my sister anymore.&nbsp; We spoke for about an hour when I called her from Al Ummah, but since getting back, we didn't spend any time together.&nbsp; Quite honestly, I don't feel like spending time with her&nbsp;or talking to her much anymore.&nbsp; I don't want to sound dicky, but I don't get anything out of our conversations anymore.&nbsp; We don't have much to talk about, plus I'm sick of being judged all the time (despite&nbsp;her supposed good intentions).&nbsp; Let her do her own thing in Boston, I'm about to head to Atlanta to do my own thing.&nbsp;   I can't wait to get down to Atl.&nbsp; It was as if heading away to Al Ummah was the first page of the next chapter of my life.&nbsp; Now I'm back in the previous chapter, albeit temporarily, and I can't stand it.&nbsp; I feel like I'm not living my life for me anymore.&nbsp; Today, I went to my dad's new office and started cutting and pasting computer files.&nbsp; The thing was the most tedious job I've had to do so far since getting back, but I had to do it.&nbsp; I can't complain, I need to help dad.&nbsp; But it's another one of the reasons I want to get away and start living my own life for me.&nbsp;   Other than that, some of the better moments of my day have been sitting here at the computer talking to some of the kids from AU.&nbsp; I really wish I got to spend more time with these kids... the conversations are great, and there's so much to talk about with them.&nbsp; I feel like at camp, I rediscovered what it was like to really live.&nbsp; To actually open up to people and share your soul.&nbsp; AK even said towards the end how I was relaxing and letting my guard down.&nbsp; And it felt pretty damn good to do that.&nbsp; Now at home, there's nobody to share it with.&nbsp; That's another one of the reasons I don't feel like talking to my sister anymore... anytime I try to share anything honest, I get that&nbsp;damn condescending stare.&nbsp;&nbsp;Screw that.   But all bitterness aside, being home has its virtues.&nbsp; I've been finally having decent food, I've actually had the self discipline to work out regularly.&nbsp; I've also been less lazy.&nbsp; I've realized how badly 99.99% of tv sucks, so I'm finding other stuff to do instead of watching crap all the time.&nbsp; I need to get out of here.&nbsp;

       So as I sit here in Meadville, PA. I'm confused.  I can't believe it's been nearly a month since I've gotten here.  I'm a bit weirded out to go home and see everyone again.  I was thinking about it, it's been a little strange, how I'm only heading home for a month before moving to Atlanta.  Thank God.  Al-Ummah was the first step in forming my new life.  It's only been 3 weeks, but it feels like the experience of several years all compressed into a month.    I'm thinking about the way I was when I first got here.  A few weeks back, the counselors all had a few hours off, so we sat in a grassy field and bonded.  We were going around, telling eachother our first impressions of one another.  Sultan thought I was originally a complete tool.  Rightfully so... the first conversation I tried having with him was about Angels & Demons (aka DaVinci Code with different names for the characters).  Thinking about the way I was before camp is strange.  I feel like I'm a completely different person at this point.    The participants left this morning, the rest of the counselors are napping right now.  I'm one of the few who got a good night's rest last night, so I'm blogging for the first time as the cliched 'new me.'  I miss the kids already.  I was walking around the nasty and dirty hallways of the now empty dormrooms... seeing all the towels and Axe deodorant spray left behind.  It finally hit me that they're gone.    To sum up the Al Ummah experience, it really wasn't what I was expecting.  It was different and a whole lot more.  The first week of counselor camp was fun, but I started sinking into one of my oh so typical but never expressed withdrawals.  I was having moodswings, so sometimes I'd be enjoying myself with everyone, other times I was thinking of just vanishing.  Week two came around and the participants arrived.  I managed to offend a few the first day (but apologized the next day... today I exchanged warm hugs and I miss them already... learned the power of apology and self improvement).  Week three I was just taken off guard... I withdrew from most things and just thought about the situation I was in.  This past week I felt like the personality I thought I killed and buried within myself came back to life.  For the first time in years I feel like I've opened up and let my guard down.  And I have to say, it feels pretty good.    I'm heading home on Sunday.  I'll share more experiences when I have the chance.

       Over at Al Ummah, we had a quote board.  One kid wrote, "Procrastination is like masturbation... in the end, you're only just screwing yourself."  I thought that was oddly relevant today.  I was trying to take care of the remainder of my paper work and my immunization forms for school.  This is stuff I should've taken care of months ago.  But hey, procrastination is fun.   I got a call from my cousin today, I havn't heard from her in months.  She's shipping out to Afghanistan with the UN tomorrow.  Sounds like an opportunity of a lifetime, but I'd be a little apprehensive before going to somewhere like Afghanistan.  It takes a lot of courage to do what she's doing, and I'm proud of her for that.  Funny part is she's officially based in Pakistan!  So my parents continued their semi-hostile takeover of my Brooklyn apartment.  Since my dad opened up his new office, he keeps planning on staying here at my place.  That means for the next week, if we all stay here, I get the privelege of sleeping on the air-mattress in the non-airconditioned living room.  So I picked up my mom from work and brought her over before heading out to have dinner with Rahim and Noureen.   They called later saying they didn't feel like staying, so I get to sleep in my room tonight.  The nice thing is that my mom cleaned up my dirty apartment.  I remember while I was in London, I cleaned my place thoroughly before my mom and sis came to visit.  When they arrived, their first reaction was, "How could you live in such a dirty apartment," and managed to clean it properly.  It was like that today... I always thought my apartment was relatively clean.   Tonight I had dinner with Rahim and Noureen at their place.  They're such awsome people to talk to.   They now live on the upper east side, a pretty fun neighborhood.  Fun night, great conversations.  I'm gonna miss having nights like tonight.   Until next time.

       Summer is almost over.  This was my first actual summer vacation in 2 years.   That was probably the hardest thing to get used to after graduation, the lack of long drawn out holidays.  Luckily, I quit my job at the end of May and enjoyed the time off.  Al Ummah was terriffic, and quite honestly, being idle at home wasn't all that bad either.  I complained about the boredom, but when else in my life before retirement will I have the chance to be this lazy?   So this weekend was fairly good.  My sister came down from Boston (as usual, because having lived on Summer in Boston, I know how much that city can suck).  It was good.   I finally got things normalized with her.  I was angry for some reason since getting back.  I guess it was a bit of a shock, my family being in a different routine since the beginning of summer.  All that unfamiliarity all at once was a bit weird, and I took it out unnecessarily on my folks.  Luckily I'm realizing this now instead of being pissed off for the remainder of the time I'm here.   Earlier this week I went with Joyce to see an off-off-Broadway show called 'Hoover.'  It was in a tiny theater off of St. Mark's Pl.  Really funny show about the former FBI director and his cross-dressing / abuse of power.  Ironically it was very pertinent to today's situation with the whole terrorism thing.  The cast was only about 6 people playing multiple roles, but pretty damn funny.   Hopefully I'll be able to hit up the beach tomorrow.  Pending no rain.
