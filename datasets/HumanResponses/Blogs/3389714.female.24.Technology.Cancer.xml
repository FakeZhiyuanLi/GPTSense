      Woke up today at 6:30am .. fully rested…it been a long time since I got decent sleep.. I think it was all the craziness from the previous few days that finally took a toll on me..but feel I like a million bucks today.. woke up... walk downstairs to find the whole family sitting around the kitchen table enjoying breakfast on… yes u got it on “a bloody WEEKDAY” it was odd.. but nice… mom had to go to work late today ..so she thought with dad’s leg and all she’ll treat us all to a warm breakfast..I honestly hate stuffing my face with cold corn flakes in the morning ..and oatmeal is out of the question it taste like mushed blob to me …however, I passed on the breakfast ..and negotiated my way to making dad iron my khakis.  It worked.. I despise ironing ..i don’t mind washing clothes or folding them just hate ironing .. oh well .. trotted back upstairs and bushed my teeth..took a warm shower today ..had to wash hair…decided to give it a quick blow dry and headed downstairs to pick up my perfectly ironed trousers..mom managed to give a quick yet extremely loud shout stating I was once again drippin on her carpet…I swear I wasn’t..I just think she enjoys clearing her throat every morning by yelling at me ..lets just call it her throat exercise…..Due to today’s unruly weather of humidity and rain..i decided to wear my new tennis jacket with a white tankie.. I actually looked good on me ..wow ..i successfully dressed myself today..yippie.. anyways was havin a awesome hair day ..and I defiantly started the day off with a positive note.. made 2 sandwiches and decided that I’ll get to work on time today..i opened the side door to see mom’s mini-van blockin my car..yell for mom…like usual she was admiring her non-existent garden in the backyard..in which she recently planted seeds..she managed to pull her van out for me ... to now make a quick dash to work…once again did not break record time of 3 min..hit 2 traffic lights..moving forward..got to work on time ..and decided to read emails and savor the silence of an empty office over a cup of tazo chai latte…it was great… wrote a few emails here and there..and my director emailed me cuz he wanted to consult me on creating a tag line for an online dictory..i was shocked ..i was never the marketing kind..i emailed him my 2 cents..hopefully he’ll like it .. did some research on cicadas yesterday ..i know that their hitting the jerzy area ..and I’m totally freaked…I hate those little f*ckers… I mean they come by the millions, and they shed their exoskeletons all over the place then they mate and bloody die ..yah it's a great life ..but hey their so damn messy..and absolutely gross..they're hideously ugly and a total freak of nature if u ask me … I mean if we were goin to be mobbed by pretty butterflies I don’t mind..but these boogers look like a mutated mosquitoes .. damn gross… oh well if yah all are interested in reading up on cicadas you can go to http://cicadamania.com . anyways wow did u watch American idol last night I managed to get in the last 5 min.. I was a bit upset I had my heart set on Diana .. oh well..same thing happened to me last season..i had my heart sent on Clay..and they year before on Justin…oh well I guess I don’t ever agree with the rest of America.. umm .. Had an interesting convo with a friend last night it was quite refreshing.. we talked about the activities I was in during my High Schools days ..it was fun walkin down memory lane.. enjoyed it …Thanks P..anyways better get back to work…talk to yah all tomorrow…tata..

      Yesterday was a rough day…felt extremely stress and tired… woke up with a weird feeling that today was not goin to be a pleasant day… Haden’t really touched the editing on the user manual… finished stat analysis and then got assigned a crazy yet tedious project… I didn’t mind.. just hated the fact that it was complicated… I mean you had to check then double check then check once more to make sure u did it right… I hate projects like that… they make u question yourself and the way u think… I guess it sort of like when u leave to go to work and when u down the street you get the notion that u left the door unlocked…so u make a U-turn and go back home to check…u quickly turn the handle and Yep it locked…then u dodge back to your car so u won’t be late to work again…then when u sit down at your desk..u get that feeling again..where u wish u turned the door knob both ways and gave the door a push..just to make sure it was locked… It’s a weird sort of paranoia… oh well…after work…went home ..had to go to the library but got lazy and headed home…dad was sitting on the couch with his leg up on the coffee table … I sort of felt bad… but I think it will do him some good to sit and relax… he’s never relaxed and chilled for as long as I can remember .. he’s like a worker ant… can’t sit still.. anyways… Had a god awful night last night.. sleeping was out of the question.. my mind was working overtime.. and I was beyond upset.. I don’t know y… I was up talking to friends till midnight… and had a blast…once I hung up the phone .. I decided to wash up for bed … came back to my room and got this sense of pure loneliness.. it was the worst feeling ever… I didn’t know what to do.. didn’t want to cry didn’t want to mope around feeling sorry for myself… seeing the room that I resided in made me feel that I lost myself in the past few years … I got into bed and attempted to think about happy thoughts.. but I couldn’t .. just couldn’t shake that lonely feeling … then I thought I’d think of names of all the people that really luved me .. I could only at the time name one .. GOD.. it was scary I know that there’s a lot of people out there that I’d like to think give a damn about me ... but my mind froze .. I began to think does god luv me .. I don’t even know him..never met him..yet I think he luvs me .. yah I know I was at my all time low .. perhaps it’s life takin its weird toll .. I need a serious vacation… Been stressed a lot .. it hard adjusting to change .. it can seriously do a number on you … I’ve decided from this point on I’m goin to make an extra effort telling my family and friends that I luv them..sometimes only actions don’t count ..i think sometimes people need to HEAR that they are luved … I know that I surely do…   Something to think about: When was the last time someone told u they luved u .. and u felt warm inside..u believed it ..it wasn’t just to be nice .. when was that last time?  PS: i'm seriously craving ... green skittles ... yummy...

      It’s 8:40 got me some tea…read my emails…and it looks like it goin to be a slow yet extremely boring day…been doing a lot of thinking lately about life and all …it’s odd how your past shapes your future…I noticed that I actually luved my High School years, but hated my college years.  Don’t get me wrong, I had my friends and a good share of men in my life while I was in college…It’s just that now when I look back at it … I don’t think I enjoyed it…I mean in college it was all at my disposal … I lived on campus, didn’t have mom and dad breathing down my back… the guy girl ratio was 14 to 1… I mean hello 14 guys to every girl ..yah it was nice… I feel as if I cheated myself … early on during my freshmen and sophomore years I tended to date cuz.. hey he was hot… had a nice smile ..gorgeous hair.. I know I was extremely shady.. but I’m sure those guys only dated me cuz of my physical characteristics … Which I do not pose anymore .. and have lost hope of posing … I mean size 4 jeans … I’d be glad if I can stick one butt cheek into that now.. I mean I guess I was pretty popular in college I once had a friend tell me “every girl wants to be you and every guy wants to nail you” .. I laughed it off…whatever .. We were so immature back then… In college everything was about …who slept with who, and what the hottest club was, and how much lick can one hold with out totally vomiting .. And high school was about ice cream parlors and roller skating rings and who had their 1st kiss with who… I guess once you through with college and start working u loose your sense of havin fun..i mean I think I did .. now life is about when I can make time to do laundry, or vacuum, or take the car for an oil change …  I noticed I need to make an effort just to keep in touch with friends I mean in high school and college I took them for granted … They were always there… Currently .. lets just say all my friends have lives and I ..well I think doing laundry on a weekday rather then the traditional weekend is mucho exciting… Yah .. I truly need a MAN … I don’t know when I hit rock bottom … I mean in college there was always a guy… hell I had backups… now…it become so hard .. I assume it cuz ..back then I dated to have a good time… go out to dinner, go dancing and then I’d go back to my place and he’d go back to his place and we’d call it a night… there was no real pressure.. NOW!!!..u got mom breathing down your back stating that you need to get married .. and grandma constantly b*itchin… informing me that I’m goin to be 24 soon and that I’m still stupidly single.. I guess now I’m not looking for a boyfriend anymore but rather a HUSBAND…I know sounds scary..but hey I have an excuse … I’m single cuz I’m out lookin for a man who’s marriage material…this sucks …think I’m goin to go back to my tea it's 9:06 and i'm here till 4:30 ish..gonna be a long *ss day… talk to ya all tomorrow…   Something to Think About: I like my coffee black but drink my tea with cream and sugar…isn’t that a bit odd… Wonder if that hot guy from the sister company is around today…he did have a cute butt…OK I admit I’m a butt girl .. I think a man’s butt has a lot to say about him…yup…nice butt…sweet…

      Heard a loud banging on my door, I knew I set the alarm Sunday night for 6:00…I have to go to work early for the next 2 weeks..i don’t mind..i get to come home at 4:30…Looked around for my mini alarm clock the time read 5:24am…Managed to get out of bed to answer the door…mom was hysterical…she stated that I call Brian..it was odd how she was able to remember my co-workers name..yet very weird that she would mention it 1st thing in the morning.  I managed to get in a WHY? in between all her senseless babble… She managed to calm herself down to tell me that I needed to take my dad to the hospital…I was baffled ..i mean dad and hospital in the same sentence..my dad’s like superman..he can withstand any kind of pain…I was shocked..mom told me he didn’t sleep all night..and he was feeling awful today…basically what happened was Sunday afternoon…my dad and bro…decided to be macho and install a built in A/C unit all by themselves…mom and I did not take much concern to their project due to the fact that they always do stuff around the house..and with dad being an architect…mom and I assumed that he must now a thing or two…so we decided to go to PA and hit the mall…We came home around 7ish to find a stretch band-aid around dad’s right foot…dad said it was a minor sprain and we ignored it and gave the man two aspirins…Anyways, mom decided that now she will take dad to hospital and that I should go to pick him up…when he calls…so dad called and I went to pick him up..he stated that he had a fracture in his leg..i didn’t know what to say ..other then ok what next..he stated we need to go to the out patient ward to pick up x-rays and then head to an orthopedic surgeon’s office…we went to Dr. Tan’s…to find out that he will be in at 1..we got an appointment at 1:30 and headed home…dad called up his work and told them that he will not be in today..i called up my work and told them I’d be in before 4..it odd how ppls at my work are so considerate about dad’s condition ..while dad’s boss and co-workers started stressing..i guess he had many solo projects he was working on… I ended up watching TV for about and hour and a half then had lunch..took dad to the orthopedic surgeons office..to got a plaster cast put on his leg…it was odd having a another person give dad instructions on how he should go about living life for the next few weeks..Dad never listens to anyone…anyways dropped dad at home and I rushed to work..didn’t break the record of 3 min..i hit 2 traffic lights..damn..oh well…got to work everyone was like how’s dad?..i stated fine ..and went on my business…I had to do stat analysis on last weeks activities however wrong reports were given to me..gotta go back and tell sister company to run stats again… I’m not having a bright day…oh well…gotta get back to work..hopefully this is how bad it get..can’t picture any more chaos in my life…lets c it’s only 4:21 pm.    New Development: Saw a new guy that must have been just hired at our sister company…and let me tell u he is damn yummy…mmm' mmmm' good!

      Yesterday was an awful day at work..nearly died of boredom…got very little done…however today got a meeting with the director hopefully this new project will be exciting…it odd…when I’m given project I work on it nonstop..till it gets done..then once it’s done..well I got nuthin to do…god I’m a wacko…I’m excited about this Chase project…hopefully I’ll get to meet new and interesting people…wokeup really early today … don’t know y… couldn’t sleep…lied in bed thinking..about the silliest things..got out of bed around 9:30…brushed teeth…and headed downstairs to find a note written by dad in his neatest handwriting ..informing me that I once again forgot to put dishes in the dishwasher..i’m not goin to complain ..it was my fault that I forgot.. decided to make breakfast and started rising off the leftovers on the dirty dishes and made a neat pile on the counter … then turned on dawson’s creek at 10:00 …god I’m bloody addicted to those reruns.. I guess that truly shows I have no life.. managed to wash down breakfast with a glass of OJ while watchin adolescent at it best on TBS…headed to the kitchen to placed dishes in dishwasher … walked upstairs and took cold shower .. had to wash hair… listen to Z100 while getting dressed… I wonder what it’s like to be a radio personality… must be amazing.. those guys never run out of things to say..or never have awkward silences with their audiences .. I don’t think I could ever be a radio personality… decided to blow dry hair didn’t want it to turn into a frizzy mess…and threw on some clean clothes and headed out the door…to find out that empty garbage cans are blocking the entrance of the driveway … placed garbage cans on front lawn and rushed out of the driveway .. I broke my record time by takin 3 min to drive to work… I’m quite please with myself … walked into work say hi to co worker … log onto computer and start reading emails … today can’t be as bad as yesterday.. so I think I’ll start today off with a smile…: )  Thought for the Mind: When a friend hurts your feelings or u get a notion that they are degrading you..what should u do?… I would take out the time to just relax think things through .. go over what happened … It’s a matter of saying sorry and then replayin by saying “it’s ok .. I forgive you” ..  but it’s up to u whether u want to forgive that someone… I tend to always forgive and that is my weakness .. I need to go to sleep at night knowing that I did not hurt anyone’s feelings … if someone is hurting then u should know that they are truly sorry … u just need to be careful that they don’t hurt u again…next time I’ll keep my eyes open…

      People in this world are so cruel ..i hate them all..people always point out your flaws..when u wouldn’t dare point out theirs… I hate that… actually not only do I hate it ..but it hurts…it’s like a bloody dagger going through your heart… I don’t need people to directly tell me I suck…but what’s worse is that people I think luv me indirectly tell me I suck even more.. take a good long look at yourself in the mirror and face reality… I’m sure you will find flaws that u wish u never had.. listen god's a cruel being… he made sure that no one he created was perfect… even hritick roshan has a flaw ..with is extra thumb… so stop judging people on their flaws and look inside them …I’m sure they have a heart and some luv to offer u…    Question of the Day:  How did u feel when someone pointed out your flaws?  I felt like a piece of 3rd world shit suffocating underneath someone’s old smelly bata chapels.

      There’s not a lot of things that irk me…however today while riding up 11 floors in a claustrophobic elevator I saw a women in her late 50’s wearing a pair of black silk pants that rode up her *ss…it drove me nuts …I wanted tap her shoulder and ask her to go home and change her pants to spare her co-workers from having chronic nightmares.  Well, due to this unprecedented event that took place I decided to make a list of   things that irk me:   Things Women Do That Drive Me Nutz:  1) They wear lipstick outside their lips 2) When anorexic-ly thin women at the gym complain that “I still need to loose 10 pounds”   3) They wear high heels but don’t know how to walk in them 4) They wear pants that ride up their butts   5) They wear a bra that’s 3 sizes too small so it looks as if they have a uni-boob    Things Men Do That Drive Me Nutz:  1) When they try to see who can burp the loudest and longest 2) When they wear their pants so low that we are forced to look at their chunky hairy *sses every time they bend over. 3) When they ask if you had an orgasm after s*x… “Hello, we never do ..we just fake it ..all the bloody time” 4) When they make a puppy dog face and pour fake tears out of their eyes when you inform them that “Yes, your wee wee is a bit too small” 5) When they ask you if  “THEY” are real…”Hello, they are always real…even if they’re fake”  Well here’s my list ..feel free to leave a comment on what drives you nuts:

      I haven’t really relaxed or un-winded in a very long time .. I’m always thinking or worried about something or someone ..but this weekend I wanted to be selfish and take care of myself…on Saturday I went to the gym ..and then hit the park with my sister…I parked the car under a tree and opened all the windows and read .. yah u got it I read for about 2 hours straight ..it was great…the cool breeze getting tangled within my hair ..and the soft chirping of baby birds in the trees above…it was the most amazing feeling ..it was just me and the world… I think I’m going to do this every weekend .. I enjoy it thoroughly ..plus it’s about time I manage my time usefully… On Sunday…I decided to go shopping I had a whole list of things to get…however when I hit the store all the items on my list appeared to be beyond ugly on the display shelf…so I ended up coming home with 2 disc-mans…one for me and another for my brother… during my time at the store my buddy C-man called about 2 to 3 times … he was having issues picking out presents for his parents… I guess I know where he’s coming from I never know what to get my parents … at times old people have such complicated taste ..or else very high expectations… to top of my wonderful weekend Doctor P called and he quizzed me on my sports teams and the cities they were from ..i’m not really a huge baseball, football, basketball, or hockey fan ..but I was surprised that I knew so many teams from all sorts of cities… I think Doctor P was a bit surprised at my sports trivial knowledge…soon after Doctor P and I started practicing my guju in a very unusual manner… My gujarati sucks.. I speak so poorly and have no idea how to conjugate verbs… I think the Doctor got a good laugh listening to me sound like an *ss but hey .. at least I’m trying to get better…I’m excited today Dr. P and I are going to go over colors and fruits in guju…yippie… mu thanna maaru?…    Question of the Day…   If you can bite anyone anywhere where would u bite them…?   I would bite someone on their shoulder it’s the perfect shape ..it will fit perfectly in one’s mouth once they open their jaws very wide…so u all out there wear extra shoulder pads ..cuz I might just bite u…yummy…

      Woke up today with yesterdays headache…stayed in bed for an extra ½ hour … hoping my body would cooperate… however it didn’t .. so I got up and took a cold shower… got dress called Doctor P to make sure he got up… lately I feel as if I am getting up on time how ever the rest of the world isn’t …and it’s my mission in life to give them a wake up call…well soon after I hung up…I got dressed and jetted out the door to see I was about 10 min ahead of schedule ..which in my case never happens… so I decided to grab some breakfast to go…I desperately needed coffee ..holy hazelnut coffee that would perform an exorcism on my body and banish the throbbing in my cranium…..so I broke again ..but with out coffee I’m totally delusional and dysfunctional…so go ahead bite me…   Question of the Day:  Are you ticklious? ..if yes ...where are u the most ticklious…?  I’m extremely ticklious..and I tend to laugh chronically till streams of tears pour down my face…I’m most ticklious on the soles of my feet and the sides of my neck.

      It’s 5:22 pm…and I just had to get myself away from my desk ..i was nodding off… I have a slight headache from disobeying my natural sense of sleep ..didn’t sleep well last night ..my mind would not stop thinking…it was going as fast as the express Amtrak train from Newark Penn Station to Union Station in DC…However there was nothing that could intervene the daily routine that this train took…unlike me…I’m at work falling asleep due to boredom I suppose… the weather is gorgeous outside and the air is fresh..i’m locked up in a high-rise where I breath in artificial air that the air conditioning is pounding out vigorously… I needed to save myself from my own natural subconscious…I grab an ice cold water bottle from the soda machine ..thinking the coldness of the fake spring water will drive my sleep away… the water is cold and crisp in my mouth and my tongue shied  away… however the sleep was reluctant to leave my body ...I still had another 2 and a half hours to go… I was trying to focus on my monitor hoping to see if I had received mail, however I hadn’t ..right then the phone on my desk rang… my phone never rings… I haven’t really given anyone my number…I picked up the phone and a women was talking about some make-up product ..I told her we do not sell make-up and we offer financial software… she was extremely rude and kept yelling…my head was about to split wide open …the pain was so intense …I could almost picture my brains pouring out of my skull as if someone had poured to much spaghetti in a bowl and the noodles would pour out as if a violent volcano had erupted …finally she asked if this was 1-800-xxx-xxxx…I said no ..she ended off saying “God Damn” and hung up before I could say “Bye”…I think that did it… my eyelids are not playing tug of war with my brain..and my pupils have obeyed to adjust to the light setting..however the headache just got worse…perhaps I’ll go straight to bed after dinner…hopefully I’ll get some desperately needed sleep…

      Recently I was told by a friend that I drink too much coffee…I’m not a caffeine addict, due to the fact that I hardly drink soda and never took caffeine pills to stay awake during finals.  There are 2 reasons that lead me to drink: 1) to wake me up in the morning 2) cuz it’s cold in my building.  I decided that drinking on an average 4 to 5 cups of coffee is well not all that healthy, and wanted to do something about it.  Tea was my solution…I went and bought all sorts of decaf tea…  It was not bad… I’d have numerous cups of tea though out the day and never felt guilty… until today…  I was up all night talking to my S mama (uncle),  I adore him and he’s really awesome for a 30 year old …I haven’t been a good niece lately cuz I don’t really make an effort keeping in touch…but yesterday we talked for an hour and a half…till 3:30 in the morning… keep in mind that I needed to wake up at 6 to get to work… The alarm rang at 6:00am precisely and I proceeded on fulfilling my daily morning ritual of cleaning one self and getting one dressed…before long I found myself sitting at my desk in intense pain… my head was killing me…. It felt as if I partied hard and had a bit too many everclear jello shots…was I hung over from having a conversation with my favorite uncle…it obviously is not a good reason to have this massive headache…so I decided to drink a cup of tea …nothing happened…took a pill …still nothing…then proceeded to go to the café and get a cup of coffee … took one sip and I was cured… the headache was gone ..and so was the nausea … I believe it’s all mental… but hey… I tried and I broke… I luv coffee and I’ll find a way of getting it into my system by all sorts of means including: a) oral application b) anal submission c) snorting though the nose and d) injecting though needles …nah I’m just kidding…I tend to eat these coffee by-products….1) coffee flavored ice cream 2) coffee flavored chocolates 3) coffee cake 4) coffee milkshakes, ect….what can I say I LUV COFFEE!!!!  Question of the Day:  If you were dared or promised a huge lump sum of money would you ever kiss a person of the same sex?  I think I would.. it’s just a kiss…however I would mind if the person being kissed was not straight…then I would not…cuz then it would just be full blown creepy…ewww

      Ok… for the people who know me and have seen me before know that I have short jet black super straight hair… however, I’ve noticed that humid weather really feeds my hair unruliness… it’s not only frizzy but it starts doing this wavy thing… just like the way old Indian actresses used to keep their hair in black and white movies… anyways my solution to this unruliness was a straightening iron… it works pretty well on my hair without doing any major damage... I’ll keep the iron on very low heat and quickly slide my hair though it .. my whole freaking head only takes about 2 to 3 minutes to di-frizz…  so due to my luck today.. not only was it the most HUMID day ever …it was raining like a skanky sridevi rain dance video…the only thing missing was me in a see though tight *ss sari …non-stop pouring rain.. to top it off …it was my sister 8th grade graduation ..which I was already 15 min late for…  I ran out of the shower and got dressed to see that my hair had a life of it’s own.. I then quickly proceeded to turning on the hair iron and finished getting dressed… I propped myself down in front of the full body length mirror and started my usual hair straightening exercise ..however it was odd the iron wasn’t warm ..i turned the knob all the way to full heat… and nothing happened… the stupid thing was broken..  I ran out the door and rushed to my sister middle school with my afro like hair… and you will not believe who came to greet me at the door… an ex-co-worker.. I was so embarrassed… she said hi and asked it I got a perm ..i laughed and said bad hair day.. soon after my sister received her 2 dollar cheap paper diploma ..i rushed to the hair solon to pick up another iron.. this time I was smart and got the one that had a 2 year manufacturer’s warranty… I wasn’t playing games.. so it turns out the new iron is amazing ..and now guess who’s having an awesome hair day… ME!!!!   Question of the Day: Which is sexier ..sari or a bikini?  I think a sari is sexier…cuz it leave a lot more to the human imagination…

      I had a pretty decent weekend.. it was the usual… chaos… nothing new… I decided that form now onwards ..i’m going to make alone time for myself.. that’s where I spend a few hour to treat myself once a week.. like on Sunday.. I grabbed some low fat coffee mocha chip ice cream and bought the book dimpsey recommended “holy cow” by sarah macdonald..and hit the park… I sat in my car with the windows wide open… and just read… it was a great feeling there was no one to bother me or scream my name as if I had just ran over a dog… no mom judging my every move ..and dad was not in sight… it was a great feeling for 2 hours I actually thought I was special ..and didn’t have a care in the world … it’s been a very long time since I felt this way..my life is so inter-twined with my parents’ and siblings’ that I’ve truly lost myself.. I had forgotten what really makes me happy…a book and an ice cream cone… I told ya all I’m not high-maintenance …   Question of the Day:  Why is it that I have no problem watching 2 guys make out but get a bit freaked when 2 girls go full throttle?

      Ok..now check this out …got royal mail form guess who?..u got it dimpsey doodle…we used to send each other letters with cards…however since we both started blogging the letters stopped…anyways to my great surprise I got a card…I could barely take off my shoes..i was so giddy…I could barely stand straight ..mom asked me twice if I had to go to the bathroom while I was talking off my shoes..i couldn’t even say no..i was frantically waving dimpsey letter in front of my mom and my siblings…It's like getting birthday cake when It’s not your birthday…I managed to get my sexy boots off and sprinted up the stairs to my room…my sister was right behind me…I got to my room dropped my bookbag..and anxiously ripped open the envelope…it was a card … I liked it…it had pictures of candy all over it … I started to look in the envelope and the card but … hey there was no candy…I was a bit confused… the card said that I was as sweet as candy..so u’d assume that she would have packed a piece of chocolate…so then I proceeded to read the card….and hello…the girl totally fooled me…she said she sent the card to tease me cuz I was on a diet..and she knew I was trying not to eat chocolate…ok so the girl totally got me..and I felt like an *ss…but hey I had another card to add to my collection…I luv getting stuff in the mail ….as long as it’s not bills… at times I order stuff online just to see the Fed-Ex truck outside my door…I mean yah I can run down to the mall at the Gap and buy clothes but hey I’d never loose a chance of seeing a hot sweaty sexy guy with dirty blonde hair wearing tight little shorts and timberland work boots with a tight white button down shirt where a small logo reading FED-EX is plaster on his left breast ..yummy…yummy…but sometimes gods a bit cruel and he sends a fat old lady who’s never heard of shampoo to my doorstep ..but the best part of receiving a package in the mail is opening it..i get pure enjoyment opening boxes and letters even if I know what’s inside…I guess I’m a bit silly…but u know what it makes me happy…so have no worries GAP I’ll still keep you in business….and FED-EX keep hiring those hotties…   Question of the Day:  Who would you like to see outside your doorstep?

      Ok check this out…I think luck is totally playing on my side today…woke up at 8:00… had to take ba (grandmother) back to Hoboken…I had work at 12 so I didn’t care diving her back home..however she mentioned that she needed to go to the bank so I was like “I’ll drive you..no need to walk in the heat”..she was grateful and I dropped her off at the bank and doubled parked on Washington street…for all you guys who don’t know …I was born in Hoboken..right near the Hudson river…over looking the new york skyline..it’s a great place ..mostly a college town and now there a growing breed of young professional living there as well..while I was dazing off into space sitting in the car waiting for ba..I noticed it..a small bagel shop..i was shocked...it had the same sign, windows and doors…as I remembered ..G masi used to take me there when I was no older then 6…she used to hold my hand and ask me what bagel I wanted…I’d always say cinnamon raisin ..but I wanted the bagel with the most raisins…G masi and the store owner used to laugh and he’d go to the basket filled with cinnamon raisin bagels and pull out the one with the most raisins ..and place a bit of cream cheese on it…we’d take the bagels to the park where I’d play with the pigeons ..and G masi used to feed me .. I remember having a cream cheese mustache ..and running away when G masi tried to wipe it off..haha..now I’d die of embarrassment if I was caught in public with cream cheese pasted on my face…we’ll I left my car double parked and prayed I didn’t get ticketed and ran into the bagel shop…the owner had aged dramatically…but still had that quirky smile… he asked me what I wanted..and once again I said “cinnamon raisin bagel with tons of raisins lightly toasted with a bit of cream cheese” he smiled at me and started digging though his basket…I’m utterly happy today and I thank that bagel shop on Washington street for putting a smile of my face…MUHAAA…   Question of the Day:   How do you like your bagel? (toasted, butter, cream cheese, jelly)

      I only went to India once in my life when I was 13 .. I was born and raised in New Jersey, USA.  I’m your typical ABCD that will never understand anything typical desi…I remember sitting in a 15 passenger van with various family members wearing sari’s and dothi’s … I was told we were going to visit my dad’s house in some remote village in Gujarat.. Mom told me dad had a great big farm with cows and buffalos .. I was soo excited…I thought it would be a bit like Little House on the Prairie … god damn was I wrong..in his little village the roads were not paved and there was cow droppings everywhere…and everyone spoke a different launague..mom said it was guju ..but it was a different dialect that we were used to… but she stated I could manage if I told family members to talk slowly…haha..PS: mom it didn’t work..that’s why I never spoke to anyone..they kept laughing at me…and calling me “Miss America”.  They all thought I was to “gori” for them…anyways..i didn’t care to speak to anyone…I had my Grandma and Grandpa..who understood English and I understood their Guju…so we got a cute little compromise going…well on my first day in dad’s village … I decided to sit outdoors most of the day..inside it was too hot … and outside there was a cool breeze.. it was odd in December the weather was decent in the mind 70’s and people were wearing blankets and sweaters ..like it was 40 degrees.. I guess they're not used to it…I used to sit on a little porch with my dada…and watch people work..I thought it was entertaining…the paan guy was always busy…making paan and mavo..and ever so often he’s spit out red crap on the dirt road..he was amazing..he was able to spit like 10 feet away.. I was totally dumbfounded ..he’d win any spitting contest here in the states…but my most amazing and vivid memory in dad’s village was the old lady who collected cow dung…she would walk around and collect all this crap and place it in a straw basket which she perfectly balanced on her head…she’d get mucho dinero if she worked for Ringling Brothers and Barnum Bailey Circus..i knew she had skills…but check this out ..guess what she did with the cow dung…she put water and straw on it and played with it ... like it was playdough…I could see the dung water slowly running down her arms and making small droplets near her elbow.  She’d wipe it off with her blue sari…and continue on kneading her pile of sh*t…like it was some sort of atta…but what I luved the most was that she’d take a piece and roll it into a ball then pat it out till it looked like a disk..afterwards she’d balance this 8 inch disk in her left palm and swing her hand over her head ..and with all her might fling the disk into a wall…in a few hours the whole wall would be covered with cow dung disks…and she’d clean up her mess and go into her concrete hut…the next day I saw the old women peeling off the disk from the wall and placed them carefully in a basket like there were mom’s special dinner china set only reserved for stuck up anti’s…before long the old women was off again to collect more cow dung..I was baffled ..this women must luv playing with cow sh*t…I wish I had some playdough for her…however if u toss playdough into a wall it won’t stick..maybe she was tryin out for the Olympics…she was pretty good..anyways .. I watched her do this for about 4 days then I got curious ..i mean hello … no one enjoys smelling like cow poo all day…I finally asked mom..and she told me they take the disk and burn it in a fire stove it tends to give off a great amount of energy and heat…because wood is hard to find where my dad lives the locals burn cow dung and straw in their stoves…well I was absolutely grossed out that I stopped eating anything that was made from the dung burning stoves and decided I’d live on prepackaged food that u didn’t have to warm up and fruits….but I still wonder about that old women..and her making cow dung patties…she must have really liked what she was doing…she always had a smile on her face and hummed sweet bajans while she worked under the hot sun…I wish her well…however I still refuse to eat roti off your stove…sorry…   Question of the Day:  Do you think it’s possible for someone to learn to love their spouse after they had an arranged marriage?  I do not think this is possible, I believe one should fall in luv…it don’t think it’s right to force oneself to love someone..one should not compromise to attain love…It should just happen naturally…

G masi woke me up and told me every one was ready..i was dumbfounded ..she knew I had to shower and stuff..that I simply brushed ma teeth and jumped into the car in the morning..this 25th wedding anniversary for my mamma and mammi was starting to become a huge drag…I rushed into the guest bath to shower and stuff …my hair was soaked and the blow-dryer was weak..it was not really doing it’s job…I could hear D kaka screaming downstairs .. I hated it … I didn’t want to go and I was obligated to represent my family..mom and dad totally set me up.. I couldn’t’ take it any more and I started cryin in the bathroom..ma sis was there and she was really something she quickly calmed me down and helped me get dressed..we were out the door..i was totally pissed and felt like crap…I loaded the kids into ma car..and waited in the driveway for someone to pull out so I can follow them..i didn’t want to talk to anyone..i hated the world.. I didn’t want anyone to feel sorry for me but hey cut me some slack…I got 2 hours of sleep the night before ..cuz the coughin wouldn’t stop..and the fever decided to come back…I was drippin wet when we got to the party but I didn’t give a damn…I just wanted it to be over..the party was decent ..but I felt like crap..the speeches were cute..but I kept tunin in and out… I luv ma family but just not that day.. they were being so difficult…y couldn’t they leave me the hell alone..i was so tired..and hurting… was scared to eat anything so I didn’t… g masi got mad at me cuz I wouldn’t eat..i told her I was afraid of throwing up..she said fine…do whatever you want...I hate it when she does that.. decided to slip away to ma car..and called up Doctor P…I was able to get some rest from the loud music and the family..it was good…I hung up after a brief convo with the doctor and headed back to the party just in time to see mama dancing like a total mad man…it was great…soon the party was over and I was back at g masi’s .. drugged myself out with nitequil and fell fast asleep…Sunday..was a mess…b and k masis were over and they were soo damn annoying..got dressed and headed to mama’s and mammi’s I wanted to leave VA by 1:00 but now it was 3:30 and we still at mama’s I was beyond pissed..we finally got out at 4:00 and I made my way to jerzy… once we passed the Delaware Memorial Bridge ..it was over..i never seen traffic so think..this was bloddy insane..and ma bro didn’t help he was so damn annoying during the drive back and ba snoring in the back seat didn’t help…I attempted to tune everyone out and made it home by 9:20 mom and dad were missing in action so I dropped ba off at ma place and went out for pizza…S masi was with us and we ended up at her house watching matchstick men..good movie…came home went to bed… woke up and now I’m at work…now bloody leave me alone…ahhhh….  Question of the Day:  Why won’t anyone make out with me?….I mean it’s just a stupid cold…please someone join me….in my misery?..Please …I hate being lonely….

      It’s been 12 minutes and I want to go home..just got to work at 8ish..saw that I didn’t have any emails so I decided to start up on breakfast…Doctor P said that I should eat oranges to get rid of my cold ..i think he used the phrase “An orange a day keeps the doctor away”…I like oranges as long as someone else is peeling them for me…unfortunately there’s no one here to peel an orange for me…so I decided to do the next best thing…I picked up some OJ and a blueberry muffin from QuickCheck..and headed to work…my taste buds are all wacked today..cuz the blueberry muffin tastes minty to me..I know my tongue has gone MAD…maybe it needs EXCERCISE … I made a funny…well yesterday was a long day didn’t go to my office party..at champs…I worked till 8 and I was beat…even though I wasn’t highly productive…had thai for dinner while watchin the Disney channel…mom was b*tchin in the background cuz she wanted to watch her Khusum…I don’t get that show ..mom’s started watching it..then dad followed ..then I caught a glimpse of it one day and now I’m addicted ..like a baby calf to it’s mother’s tit……I luv that kali chick…she’s such a b*tch…I luv how she constantly comes up with ways to f*ck peoples lives up…she makes the show fun..however I see no purpose for Khusum…the main character…she beyond useless..another person who is a waste of good oxygen…Gotta go to VA this weekend ..not looking forward to it..it’s my uncles 25th anniversary…u’d think I’d be excited ..but I’m seriously dreading it..cuz my partner in crime won’t be there…lately family gathering are only worth while if bindi is there..i’ve become so attached to her in the past few years..we mesh well I guess…anyways bindi is not coming to VA cuz she has to watch the hotel in RI…she totally b*tched me out…she’s so goin to get a piece of my mind when I see her…G masi mentioned that she going to throw a charity marathon race for the heart association over the weekend ..wonder if I should participate ..probably will…I luv helping out with charity…guess that’s something to look forward to…   Question of the Day:  Which do you prefer closed mouth kissing or full blown open mouth with saliva swap other wise known as French?

      I know I’m a few hours late posting today’s blog ..and I just wanted to say sorry to all my fans…lol…It just that well yesterday at around 3:00 pm…we lost full power (electricity) in 2 towers where I work…We do have back up generators but I assume they are not powerful enough to run 2 buildings with 14 floors each…at about 3:45 we lost all phone lines too..I know I always wanted excitement at work but this was a bit too much..it was like pure chaos…So I went home…and decided to run errands…then go to bed…my co-worker texted messaged me at 5:00am to tell me they were still tryin to install a new generator and power will not return till noon…so I turned off my alarm and turned up my ringer on my celli…at around 9:30 Brian called stating he was heading home cuz there was no power..and he didn’t think we’ll get any before 2ish..and that I should call my director at 2…so I decided to watch 2 hours of  Dawson’s Creek then a few episodes of Real World…You would think I would use this time to my advantage to do some laundry, or clean my room, hell I didn’t even make my bed..i had ultimately turned into a couch potato…I wasn’t needed at work for a while so I was just gonna chill till ma celli rang…after watchin 6 episodes of the real world the cell rang and I had to go to work…it’s 4:02 and I’m bored..I’m here till 8..and I plan on being productive today….lets see….who can I bug on my IM buddy list…umm…anyways had a thought while watchin real world … well currently we have 4 girls on that show … 1) Robin: she’s the cheerleader…with cute hair 2) Jamie: she’s the oriental girl ..very pretty..3) Cameran: has long curly blonde hair…miss goody 2shoes…4) Frankie: miss punk…she into hello kitty and dressing goth…ok so now we have these 4 girls… 3 of these 4 girls are totally into fashion ..or at least can dress well…then u have miss Frankie…she basically dresses sloppy and doesn’t care what she looks like …and all her clothes are black…however she does own one pink tank top… anyways a thought popped up in my head that out of all these girls only Frankie must wear matching undies..cuz everything she owns is black…I highly doubt the other girls wear matching undies even though they are perfectly matched externally..odd huh…well it’s just a thought…and maybe an opinion…   Question of the Day:  Is it necessary for a girl to wear matching undies to be sexy…?  I don’t think so ..cuz if it is ..hell I’ll never be sexy…I mean who really buys undies in pairs….?

      Recently I’ve been feeling a lot of pressure…and I’m not just talking about sinus pressure ..i’m talking about life’s pressure…for example my parents are pressuring me to go to grad school, to get married, and to move out…I also get pressured from my friends to go on holiday with them..when I don’t have the time to…it a bit too much..i have people constantly pressuring me into doin something when I’m not ready to..i just wish people would leave me alone…..and let me make my own decisions…it getting to be a bit too much..and I think I’m goin to blow…life really sucks when u live inside a pressure cooker…I’m just waiting for the valve to burst….then life will fall into place..and I’ll be on my merry way..as for now …. I guess u just gotta deal….   Question of the Day   What’s more important having great sex in a marriage or having a great tunnel for communication?  I think communication is far out more important cuz hell when u’re 80…I don’t know if the sex is goin to be that good…if your able to communicate freely..you can get a bit creative…and being 80 wouldn’t even matter…wink wink…

      I’ve always been told how to live my life by the people around me, all these years I’ve listened…recently I’ve come to the realization that it’s my life and I’m old enough to make my own decisions…I don’t mind opinions or advice ..hell I welcome them ..but ordering me to do something thing ...is now out of the question…my parents didn’t spend 80G’s on my college tuition for others to make my decisions for me…I think I have a mind of my own…sorry mom and dad this little baby is growing up…yesterday was a rotten day…my feelings were beyond hurt and the sad part is .. I have no reason why…I’d like to blame it on the non-existent quarter life crisis…I’m going through a clean up phase…I do it every so often ..it requires a lot of thinking and harsh actions on my part… but I think it’s healthy…It’s where I try to remove myself from all the negative people in my life… for example, you were introduced to someone by a friend and then u became friends with that person cuz hey it so easy to make friends these days..but let's now say your new friends only uses u .. as perhaps a time pass, because you have a car, or maybe cuz of your ability to do their homework, and the list can go on and on..all my life I’d had these people randomly enter my life and in turn I’d be blinded by their presence and motive ..these are the people that end up hurting your feelings in the end run ….over something extremely stupid.. they're beyond piety and cruel.. and I certainly don’t need them in my life.. so I stop talking to them .. I know that’s shady of me ..but seriously my parents didn’t create me to have some 3rd world retard use me like the last sheet of toilet tissue…I’m better then that…anyways…went to see hum tum last night…it was a cute movie and the sub titles were decent…I had a good time…however I was a bit disappointed with that saif boy…he seemed to be having a bad hair day through out the movie…oh well plus that rani chick did a great job…over all I’d give it 3 out of 5 stars… went to the gym later ..i missed my training appointment so I rescheduled for Saturday ..ended up sitting and sweating my *ss off in the steam room.. I felt so clean and relaxed when I left….for dinner  mom and dad had the nerve to order pizza not just any pizza but FAMOUS PIZZA..i mean they know I’m tryin to stay away from that stuff like that ..anyways I bought home some veggie soft toco’s it tasted like crap…I went to bed pretty early last night... I was quite amazed .. and I actually slept well probably cuz I exhausted myself …Well as for today it’s 8:29am..and I misplaced  my swipe card again ..so the people at my sister company had to open the door for me .. I have to find that bloody sucker..i know I usually put it in my back pocket of my jeans … lets c if it turns up… I’m such a dodo… I feel a bit sick today… my throat has been bothering me since I got up… it feels heavy and scratchy.. I already took one of those super strong cough drops and it not helping…I refuse to go to a doctor…I hate those guy..they never have anything good to say… oh well… I have this weird feeling that my younger sister (age 13) skipped school today…I mean check this out..her bus leaves at 8:00 and she was still in her PJ’s at 7:45 ..she hadn’t even showered ..FYI: my sister takes 45 min showers..I managed to get out a scarastic "get dressed u gonna miss the bus" ... and she replied like back like a total blonde "like nah I totally showered at night, i'm so gonna change my clothes and jet on outta here...DUH!!STUPID!!" Is it me or was her damn bus goin to pick her up in 15 min… I don’t know …that girl is way to weird for me… cuz I swear yesterday she told me talking a shower at night is so beyond totally gross…great my lil sister has turned into a hypocrite …hopefully she went to school..and I’m just over reacting… Had a very interesting convo with daddy dearest last night…he asked me if I was considering goin to Indian to find a hubby..i laughed and told him what do u think..i thought that would get me out of the discussion and I can leave his presence ..but it didn’t work this time..he shot back “it not what I think it what u think that matters”..i knew this was goin to be a long *ss convo..i decided to make myself comfortable on the couch…I told him that I don’t think India would be a logical choice for me..i’m a weird type of ABCD..don’t get me wrong I’m American and was Borned in the states and I’m hella Confused …and yah I’m Desi…but I have a fobby part to me too…I luv garba..and bhel puri…and steaming hot somosas..i don’t eat meat…I’m don’t have a personal issue with god..i don’t mind goin to the mandir…however, I refuse to go to Sunday school…I’m a weird one I know..lets see.. I left the whole "find me a guy thing" up my parents and friends I refuse to dress skanky and go to clubs and bars hoping to get a permanent man in my life..with that approach one will only get a hangover, smelly cigarette hair and a one night stand…I think that whole approach is cheap and sleazy and I refuse… I’d luv to meet someone in the mandir, or a library, park perhaps, I’ll can even do a coffee shop… I could be reading the devil wears prada..and he could be reading the latest john grishim novel.  Wow what an amazing scenario…not ever goin to happen but it was a nice thought…all over a cup of low fat tazo chai latte hold the foam easy on the cream with a dash of cinnamon.  Yup nice… oh well .. got to get back to my tea…talk to yah all tomorrow…SMOOCHIES…   Question Of The Day:  Which drink do you prefer? Sex on the Beach or Flaming Organism  I’d prefer Sex on the Beach…Flaming Organism is a bit too HOT!!! for me…Naughty Naughty…lol

      Yesterday was a very productive day…took dad to the orthopedic surgeon’s office for his follow up..he’s stuck in a cast for 8 weeks..he was not happy…it was still raining…I'm starting to get annoyed with all this downfall…ahhhh…anyways…called up S anti and we decided we needed to join a gym…we went to a place where they’re only open to women…I really didn’t care where I went as long as I was not surrounded by thin people ..like u see on the Bally’s commercial…I mean those people shouldn’t be allowed to go to a gym…so at this women only gym..we saw their pool and it was beyond nasty…so S anti was totally turned off and I was too the trainer seems a bit snobbish..so we hit another gym and walked in and I was in heaven…it was perfect.. normal people..old and yound..all sorts of shapes and sizes…amazing pool and a great hot tub…and to top it all off…there were numerous great looking desi staff members..it was like lookin at eye candy while on the treadmill…yummy…I knew this place was awesome..so I signed myself up as well as my sister for swimming classes..and decided to take an equipment training course today…so I made an appointment ..i’m really excited.. this is goin to be fun… S anti will be my partner in crime..you could tell she was glad, that now she can have alone time away from D uncle and her girls… yippie… I was watching Summerland last night and a bit of Miss Universe…Till India got out…then I lost interest ..oh well…didn’t get to finish watchin Summerland cuz my friend V called…we ended up playin this amazingly creative fantasy game over the phone… (nah nah …get your dirty minds out of the gutter it wasn’t a dirty game..you damn sickos) .. ended up goin to bed around 12 ish… Anyways…yesterday was dad’s fake b’day… we call it dad fake b’day..cuz we really don’t know dad’s b’day and neither does grandma…we always tease dad of being borned in a barn…surrounded by cows…but dad is always quick to correct us by saying “I was born in my house surrounded by buffalos”… well we know his fake b’day on his passport says june 1..and it’s a great excuse to eat cake… now that we mentioned cake..i went to this desi ice cream shop that is owned my by friend's parents.. to pick up a cake for dad.. their ice cream cakes are eggless… so mom will eat it..mom doesn’t mess with eggs…however the only one that was made for a family of 5 in a flavor we all liked was pink..so guess what dad got a pink cake for his B’day…dad’s awesome… he didn’t even notice..till we mentioned it to him..wonder where his mind was… oh well..didn’t see mom at al last night..i mean she came home I heard her downstairs …but didn’t know y ..i didn’t want to make the effort to go down to say hi..oh well ..it not like I’ve never seen mom before.. I wanted to go c a hindi movie today.. I don’t know y I watch the bloody 3 hour epics lately.. it not like i know hindi.. it like watching pictures on the screens … I don’t know.. it’s probably me tryin to be an Indian.. mom says I’m a coconut.. brown on the outside straight up white on the inside.. I think she might be right.. I want something to talk about to my desi friends, aunts, and parents… so I watch desi movies.. don’t get an ounce of it.. but I try to read the sub titles as fast as I can.. anyways.. I seriously have issues with certain desi movies.. they really need kissing scenes .. ½ the time I think the lovers in the story are brother and sister ..dancing and singin in the rain..hell I think u can dance and sing in the rain with your brother.. I know I can.. plus my brother is 6’5 imagine the huge splashes he can create when he jumps in a puddle.. hehe.. yah but to all u directors out there please add some kissing scenes into your movies so I don't misinterpreted them … nah I’ll tell u what’s worse then the brother sister rain dance routine.. it’s what happens after.. the brother and sister hug ..and in the next scene the sister is holding a baby…and guess what.. the bloddy brother is suppose to be the god damn father… I mean hello… if they had a kissing scene right before the rain dance ..i’d know immediately that they were lovers and not bro and sis .. and then the baby wouldn’t gross me out.. yah I need to go to bollywood..and give Subhash Ghai, and company some friendly advice.. god damn.. but yah I want to c hum tum..i like that saif boy..looks like a fun filled movie..lets c if S anti is up to it..ok coffee is getting cold ..yes I know I broke my coffee rule…but u know what there’s things out there that are worse then coffee..like President Bush..so leave me alone..and if not come over and kiss my mocha colored bootie…MUHAAAA…   Something To Think About:  Wouldn’t u want to dance around in the rain with your lover..like Maduri and Salman..? I know I would …but guess what …do to my atrocious misfortune..I’m only 2/3’s of the way there.. I got the backyard..and hell I’ve defiantly got the rain…just need to find myself a god damn man..y..does it always come down to that … ahh ..life officially sucks…wonder if u could rent one for a few hours just for the dance…umm something to think about…yah..

      It was great having a 4 day weekend…I was able to get out of jersey and attempt to relax…here’s a run down of the events that happened…  Friday:   Rained ..Rained like bloody hell..it was insane.. I never minded the rain ..but today I was beyond irritated.. It was driving me nutz…didn’t have to go to work today ..dad thought it would be a bright idea to hit the hospital in the morning to get his x-rays done…We made it to the hospital at 8:30 ish… I decided to quickly brush my teeth and there was no need to immediately shower ..with the rain and all .. so I headed off … dad was in pain… he had this wrinkled look on his face.. where he attempted to look calm and kewl..but in turn he was screaming bloody murder inside.. anyways got to the hospital..where there was a waiting room full of people…I could see dad getting irritated by the wait and once we were called… dad all of the sudden turned into a horrid monster..which was not him..i mean it was odd…a extremely pretty nurse called out mom’s name cuz the insurance was under her name..but the prescription was under his…that what caused all the chaos..dad snapped at the pretty nurse… and she was baffled ..and continued her work…it was odd..dad only yells when he is deeply hurt…x-rays were performed …and we headed home..decided to ease the tension by playin this bhangra CD I have… dad didn’t comment on it ..so I decided in my head he luved it..or I’d like to think he did…anyways got home … made lunch..and headed upstairs to do laundry..i decided to do 2 loads cold and hot…separated clothes and tossed a load in the washer..headed upstairs to pack clothes for trip to PA..found out that I didn’t have many clothes that I can pack …they were mostly in the large laundry pile in the center of my room…which in turn lead me to my bed and then I took a nap…woke up..ran downstairs to the basement to toss wet laundry into dryer to find brother's oversized getto *ss clothes stuffed in the dryer…to top it off they were ½ way dry.. decided that I would place his clothes in an empty laundry basket and pop my clothes in ..mom bought these amazing dryer sheets that smell like … a great big rose garden.. tossed 2 in…headed up stairs to find dad attempting to cook dinner in the kitchen by sitting on an office chair..it was a sad moment in the name of absolute boredom…dad was cookin cuz ..yes he was bored…he decided to make bangan bartha…eww…I asked if he needed help he snapped back that he was not crippled just temporary out of order ..i managed to laugh a bit in my head…I felt so awful..i let him go about cookin..and told him to give a shout if he needed me…I trotted upstairs and ended up back in bed…Arthur on PBS just finish as I woke up and saw the time…raced downstairs and grabbed the laundry out of the dryer..yes it was still hot…quickly folded the clothes and hung the ones that need to be hung…I like folding my clothes right out of the dryer ..i avoid the iron routine..which I despise..yuck yuck…pop the second load in and happily pranced upstairs to find dad layin on the living room floor with a gigantic blueprint in front of him…had this sudden urge of walkin all over his blueprints just cuz I luv the rustling sound under my toes..but I knew dad would have me murdered ..if I ruined his work…lol..walked by with a sheepish smirk on my face into the kitchen and grabbed a water bottle..i seriously need to start drinkin a lot of water ..i’ve gotten really bad..dad said we should go and get the x-rays from the hospital so back to the rotten hospital we go…I hate goin there..it smells like death….or I think it does…still rainin ..eww..came back home placed last load in dryer ..and started packin clothes …my brother and I decided to visit my aunt (b’masi) in PA..i was excited .. I was finally getting out of the house..yippie…called b’masi and asked her if she wanted any groceries she stated all she needed was squash…and to pick up dinner she the kind of person that u would go into utter shock if u saw cookin..i’ve haven’t really seen b’masi cook a meal since she got married to A’kaka…and had baby M and baby V… I really didn’t care ..i luved A’kaka warm breakfasts and barbecues...it was summer and I’m goin to enjoy it…masi said to pick up famous pizza and I thought it would be a good idea too…not knowing how much traffic we’d hit…brother came home from school to toss his ½ wet clothes back into dryer and attempted to have a small snack..i was starving ..but didn’t know what to eat..i did the usual walked into the kitchen announced to dad I was hungry dad grumbled “eat something” I grabbed 1 grape from the fruit basket and called it lunch...yes I know I’m totally insane ..now leave me alone…left home and hit a bit of traffic near the shore points then nailed 90 all the way on PA turnpike..it was great..managed to keep bro entertained by speakin in my atrocious Guju to him..i literally thought he was goin to pass out from laughin so hard..that’s when it hit me ..i had to go pee..like no other..i couldn’t concentrated on driving I had to go soo bad..and there wasn’t a rest area in sight ..i hate takin a random exit..cuz I never know what it’s goin to lead to ..but I had to soo bad… I took the exit and drove for a ½ hour to find a burger king..went pee..and felt like a million bucks..yippie..got back on the turnpike and nailed it to masi’s place before it got dark…we all hovered the pizza and grabbed the kids and went to bed…    Saturday:   Woke up by M standing over my bed … poking her little fingers into my eye sockets ..can’t believe she got so tall…in a few short months..kids these days grow up so fast..b’masi said V was not feeling well and she had to take him to the doctor’s..so she took bro with her and I went to take a shower…A’kaka was headin off to the gym when I walked downstairs…I saw that masi left a cup of coffee for me which I nooked in the micro..and had a small cinna bun..for breakfast..and guess what they had a desi program on for me..odd huh just as I was through putting dirty dishes in the dish washer a hindi movie started it was called Ganga ki saugand…or some thing like that ..it had rakha and I like her..so I sat down and chilled ..b’masi walked in with M and V..V looked horrible…and cranky..he wouldn't go by anyone..so I decided to chill with M…A’kaka came back and took bro to their neighbors BBQ..and b’mais and I decided we’ll go later … we put the kids to sleep and A’kaka came back and b’masi and I left ..the BBQ was fun but I got soo bored … I was surrounded by little toddlers or extremely pregnant women who were talking about swollen legs and nursing..i decided I was not interested in either topic and I grabbed a toddler and headed outside… it was fun these 2 adorable girls about 4 yrs old were dressed up as princesses ..soo cute..masi called me in for food..and I had a veggie burger and some pasta salad..we ended up sitting in the sun talking about interior decorating ..which was another topic I had no interest in and I tended to focus more on the horseshoe game the men were playing..we finally left he neighbors…yippie…we got home and masi had to feed the kids..she made kitchadi..eww..felt so bad..masi was pissed..M was not eating right cuz we were all around … she kicked A’Kaka and bro out so they hit a movie and I was sent upstairs and not allowed to come down till I was called…that sucked ..i decided that their dinner would take about an hour so I decided to call D a friend that was visiting from UK … she was busy..so I took a nap..to be rudely awakened by b’masi screams ..she was so loud…and M was cryin…I decided to stay in the room and not go downstairs…soon after masi called me down and the kids were fed…there was a smile of pure satisfaction on masi’s face and empty bowls in her hands…it was great ..now all she had to worry about was them not throwing up…A’kaka and bro came back and bought home toco’s for dinner..once again masi got out of cookin…went to bed after dinner….  Sunday:  Woke up at 10:30 was shocked the house was extremely quiet…walked downstairs to see masi with V in the kitchen cleaning ..odd..she said V threw up in his sleep and gotten the bed dirty..i don’t know how she does it .. I put her in the super women category ...amazing…I’d loose my kewl if I was her…she said A’kaka was goin to BBQ today I was so excited ..and kaka would also make breakfast…bro came downstairs and kaka decided to make veggie soy bacon and sausage .. for me and masi cuz we don’t eat meat…and French toast for my brother…meanwhile I played with V and M in the toy room..had breakfast ... it was amazing…B’masi said she need to get a few thing for the BBQ and now that M’masi was joining us we need more burgers…and she also was in desperate need of a pedicure ..god b’masi is so high maintenance ..lol…we hit a few clothin stores .. and masi bought a few capris and shirts…It odd everything masi puts on looks great on her.. she looks a bit like sri devi from the old hindi movies ..absolutely gorgeous .. so when she plaster a smile on her face I could almost imagine her on the bollywood big screen..i’m glad I have her as an aunt..she really something..we headed off to the super market where we picked up stuff..and headed off to the nail salon to find out that it was closed …we went home and masi took V up for a nap and I cut up all the veggies and A’kaka fired up the grill.. I was starving..M’masi came with V’kaka and Big A and Little A… it was fun having dinner with the family in the yard..listenin to lawnmowers and kids playin in the distance.. Food was great once again A’kaka out did himself..we quickly cleaned up to find ourselves snuggled up in the living room watchin National Security it was beyond hilarious .. M’masi and family left and B’amsi and A’Kaka took kids to bed ..i was now wide awake and bro and I decided that another movie was a good idea … we ended up watchin Hollywood Homicide .i think… don’t remember the name but it was with josh hartneck..umm yummy…went to bed..  Monday:   Woke up brushed teeth headed downstairs in totally shock ..nearly died…saw god and a light at the end of the tunnel…I could not believe it ..a women that looked like b’masi was in front of the stove stirring some delicious smelling content..i was amazed ..Bro was sitting at the kitchen table patiently awaiting what b’masi had stirred up..she told us not to eat much cuz it was an appetizer ..i never had an appetizer for breakfast but hey she was cookin and I wasn’t about to complain ..then she took out the big guns and made dosa…I was utterly amazed …dosa was sooo yummy..i was in heaven..this was a vacation…masi made me some wraps for the week and bro some Mexican bean dip..Masi told me to go to the super market to pick up milk, marshmallows, lettuce and onions…I managed to find all these items and I was headed out when I found a bar of Toblerone candy…masi had told me her fantasy was to sit in her room with a big bar of Toblerone candy without the kids and devour the over sized candy bar all by herself..so I bought it for her…I thought hey I can provide her the candy and A’kaka can watch the kids for an hour..and she can live out her fantasy…got back to masi’s and packed up car with luggage and food.. and we were on our way..we knew we were goin to hit traffic so I was mentally prepared for the cursing and the swearing that would come out of my mouth during our drive back…we were off …we got on the PA turnpike and nailed 80 all the way to the Delaware bridge..I was glad my friend P kept calling or else I would have lost my sanity with the traffic and my bother’s annoyin “Are we Home Yet”every 5 min. … we hit the NJ turnpike and it was over Satin was punishing me …I never saw traffic so damn think..why the hell does every one want to live in jersey… I mean I live there cuz I have to ..but it was insane ..i tried to keep my kewl..with all the stupid people drivin like the roads were owned by their dad's .. I mean have u ever heard of a turn signal..it was nutz…sort of like a war zone..like Kurukshetra from the Mahabharata..just replace the chariots with Toyotas Camery’s and Honda Civic’s..it was insane…got home to find we had company over..went to get dad prescription from Rite Aid..to find it was closed ..no biggie went home had dinner…and hit the sack…yes yes I know alone…I need a man…

      Ok ..as most of you know my only form of entertainment is my ride up 11 flights on the elevator to my office…well long behold the door opened on the lobby floor graciously around 7:55am…just for me to walk in with a cup of coffee in my left hand and my swipe card in my right.. this was a daily ritual for me ..due to the fact that I would never dare to use the stairs .. to me it was beyond suicidal ..only use stairs if elevator is broken…or if a fire occurs.. but that’s only climbing down if elevator is broken... and if I need to get to the 11th floor .. trust me I’ll call my director from the lobby and state that I’m sick and I can’t come to work today… I refuse to walk up those stairs.. ok now that we’ve totally drifted from my story lets get back…   .. the doors open ..and wow… the reincarnation of Lord Vishnu is waiting for me… he must have got on in the basement garage floor.. this guy was amazing… beyond any young adult female fantasy… god must have spend weeks making a man soo freaking perfect… I shamelessly found myself weaseling behind him in a perfectly empty elevator… I desperately needed a glace at his little tight kundi.. god it like seeing Mickey Mouse at Disney.. u just have too…can’t help it..&nbsp; while I drooled over his tight buns he softly whispered “what floor” in a delicate British accent.. all that was going though my head was “ Kris .. keep mouth closed and attempt to breath in then out….”.. I managed to softly say “11” and he flexed out his tender hard muscles to the elevator button labeled “11” that’s when I got a whiff of his freshly wash head and shoulder shampooed hair… I was in heaven.. nothing could spoil today… then due to my horrid luck once again in a super possessed elevator designed by Satan himself.. oh my god it was gross.. he lifted his right hand from his right suit pant pocket and reached behind himself and tugged…. U got it.. he bloody just picked a freaking wedgie right in front of me in a freaking elevator.. the man had no shame.. my brain went dead ..and the tacky hindi music stopped playing and me and him stopped dancing in the rain… reality hit and my daydream was brutally interrupted by is delicate fingers picking at his tighty whities… i was beyond disgusted.. the elevator now stopped and I had a huge frown on my face.. I walked out of the lift…without looking back… and remembered Newton’s 3rd law to every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.. to every thing good there is something as equally bad… I just proved this law in an elevator no bigger then 5ft by 5ft… gorgeous guy picks wedgie.. what a turn off.. looks like I’m going to have to put ice on it today.. poo…   Definition of WEDGIE: (The condition of having one's clothing stuck between the buttocks)    Question of the Day….   What’s the most gruesome act you’ve seen committed in an elevator…?

       Well here goes ..for all those to care and for all those who don’t….recently I’ve noticed I tend to pick up my cell at night if someone calls and talk to them in my sleep…when I wake up in the morning I have no recollection of the conversation...I have no idea what I say ..or whom I say it to ..to tell you the truth I don’t even remember the phone ringing…it’s very odd ..cuz the very next day I tend to throw a tantrum at my friends for not calling me back and they shockingly state that they called and we spoke on the phone ..i think my unusual nocturnal sleeping habits are effecting my memory skills.. I’ve had many friends swear on the “Wicked Witch of the West’s Grave” that they did speak to me around 2:00am EST…however I can’t seem to remember them calling or what we talked about…usually they say that I told them I’ll call them back tomorrow…or I’ll answer their questions…then hang up…this is a freighting issue cuz what if someone calls starts asking me about my deepest darkest secrete's…which I don’t think I have but maybe I do sub-consciously and I suppress them cuz their so horrid…I mean the human psyche is a complicated thing… I never talk in my sleep unless someone talks to me and starts asking me stuff.. I never voluntarily talk ..i need to voice record what I say…what if it not me talking what if it a spirit that takes over my body in the evening…so the person talking to you on the phone is not me but some dead person that was murdered by their concubine. and now he’s out for revenge and he’s using my body at night ..ahhh…way to creepy…anyways ..for all u guys out there that I’ve accused for not calling and I’m greatly sorry…but hey u have to admit I do sound cute when I’m ½ asleep….    Question of the Day….   Do you do unusual things in your sleep (ex: walk, talk, eat, or clean)..?

      Some of you might be aware of the email war that is going on in your mailboxes…I’d like to apologize for starting this whole mess…I simple wrote an email asking where all my fans were due to the fact that I hadn't received any comments one particular morning …and no one appeared on AOL IM… a simple email caused a huge controversy…some of you were intelligent enough to ignore it and delete it from your mailboxes ..other thought they had to take a stand… my whole motive with blogging was to express my way of thinking to all my friends who I honestly thought gave a damn about me.&nbsp; I thought it would be a good way to keep in touch cuz some of u are in UK, TX, FL, CA, WI, CT, and NJ…plus I get an artificial high when I’d get a comment or the counter on my page would increase by one ..knowin that someone out there just got a glimpse of my world…it’s probably the only time where I’m totally enlightened …and utterly happy… I never knew my joy for writing stupid stuff would create such a problem…I just wanted to write and have fun…sorry….  -kRiS   Question of the Day…  Now What…?

      Got into work at 8 ish today.. once again didn’t sleep well.. my hand was killing me.. I sort of pulled a muscle in my right palm…anyways got dressed and drove to work ..made a quick stop to get coffee and a muffin… turned on computer…and checked voicemails ..while I was checking emails ..my director walked by and simple said “ HI KRIS!” in turn I squealed&nbsp; “OH NO…TONY … BUG”… “WANT A TISSUE”.. tony attempted to entrap this enormous size cockroach off my desk however missed and it quickly dashed behind my desk.. I don’t know if u ever had something as enormous as a tyrannosaurus rex on your desk but I just did ..i mean it had like 5 creepy legs ..one must have broke off or he must have been a mutated bug with an extra leg… due to all the rat poison its mom must have ingested while she was pregnant.&nbsp; So currently I type in fear that this bug might jump up from behind ma desk and bloody devour my left hand pinky finger which lays freakishly on the letter “A” on ma keyboard…I however find it a bit unusual that a huge squeaky clean biosphere-like cooperate building where the men dress like they just stepped off of the set of “Men In Black” which houses thousands of cooperate zombies that work on the say of Alan Greenspan’s economic advices would allow a freaking tyrannosaurus rex like cockroach running around like a little ant in their safe haven…I should have wore my boots it probably gonna crawl up my freshly ironed GAP kaki’s with satin lined pockets… and viciously nibble on the natural wrinkles of my tender knee…with its razor sharp incisor teeth.. ahhh…gotta stop writing I’m bloody freaking out…IT’S GONNA EAT ME….    Question of the Day…   What kind of bug are u most afraid of…?

      Well yesterday we were invited to S Anti’s house for dinner…due to the fact that mom and lil sister went to Florida … and with my inability to cook S Anti decided to be a total sweetie and take over the roles of cooking to spare me the aggravation of presenting a charcoal flavored cuisine… To my great surprise anti made soft tacos with homemade salsa… she actually sat down and cut 4 pounds of tomatoes… after all u know guju’s eat salsa like it’s bloody okra curry…and tend use an oversize ladle to scoop ½ pound potions into 1 taco… well I’m personally not a salsa person ..due to the fact that on the spicy fact-o-meter on an average from 1 to 10 ..10 being extremely spicy I fall at the number (– 10).. I do not have tolerance for spicy food ..so I took an embryo size droplet and place it on the edge of ma taco ..and proceeded to take a hefty size bite… suddenly I became enchanted by this luscious texture of finely chopped tomatoes, onions, and coriander… I was baffled that I was actually enjoying this heartburn causing poison in an orgasmic way ..before long I ladled out a huge scoop of this new venom and smeared it all over the bed of lettuce and devoured it like a deprived Somalian hyena… before long I was reaching for seconds ..I knew that the salsa was tainted but with what?.. my tongue tingled at the spiciness but kept asking for more ..and my lips burned with eternal fire ..I knew I was hooked.. like a fetus to it’s umbilical cord …what caused this madness?… why was I not able to have any self-control? … why was I not able to think for myself?.. something had taken over me.. I was addicted.. but to what ..salsa.. no I think S anti must have tainted the salsa with cocaine.. she had to … like the old coca cola soda pop.. they used to put cocaine in it to have their consumers addicted to their useless idea of soda with no nutritional value.. was S anti trying to get us addicted to her salsa.. by tainting it with an illegal substance …would she dare ?…   Question of the Day…?  What do you find yourself addicted to?

      Ok I’ve noticed all desi women have huge hips and thunder thighs compared to all the other races…I know it’s good to have wide hips ..helps the birthing process…but hell I mean … it not like we goin to give birth to a f*cking hippopotamus…I’ve noticed cuz of our deformed bodies the latest fashion of clothes don’t seem to fit well example: low rise jeans ..yah they look fine when your standing up ..but have u ever sat down while wearing a pair of low rise jeans ..hello they reveal a bit more than the tip of your butt crack... I mean who comes up with these types of clothes ..probably the same guys who invented Playboy …and have u ever tried buying a bikini.. I mean no matter what style u get your thighs will never look proportional to your ankles.. so in turn your butt looks flat and your boobs look small…so u decided on a stupid one piece which will ruin your tan but will cover your oprah sized tooshie… but the bad thing is if you have the slightest bit of flab around your midriff ..it’s over.. that one piece will magnify itself 100 times to the bloody 10th power… one tiny roll of fat will look like your pregnant with septuplets… that’s why smart desi women should wear boxer bikini’s with a halter tops… this style allows u to cover those thunder thighs and enhance those size A’s…and might I also add it makes that tiny roll of flesh in your tummy area virtually disappear…. So all your desi chicks out there strut your stuff and have fun in the sun…I know I will…    Question of the Day:    What do you think looks awful on desi chicks…?

      I get a kick out of guys who wear dhoti’s..not only do they have balls…but I also think they look soo yummy…I’ve come up with a few categories of different styles of dhoti wearers…   1) Pandit Dhoti’s – The men who wear these dhoti’s are the pujaries that work at a temple and serve god. There dhoti’s compromise of a long thin white cloth that wraps around their waist. What’s unique about this type of dhoti is that it’s practically sheer and see-through ..so while your pandit is doing arti you get a full blown view of his tighty whities… the reason they wear see-though dhoti’s is because they are celibate and no one can have them …so to rub it in your face they decided that they can be a tease…shame on u..  2) Guju Garba Dhoti’s – Most of the men who wear these types of dhoti’s are young adults during the week of Navaratri. These dhoti’s come in various bright colors with exotic embroideries. What I luv the most about this style is when a young man jumps up to hit their partners dandia during raas…their dhoti fills up with air… resembling a balloon…and you get a tasteful glace at their gorgeous legs…  3) South Indian Fishing Dhoti’s – The men who usually were this style are fisherman by profession and wear their dhoti’s very high to prevent them from getting wet…almost resembling one of Paris Hilton’s micro-mini skirts…What amuses me the most about this style is the guts a man must have to wear his dhoti so short that when he bends over one can see his little chaddi…oh and might I add this type of dhoti fully exposes legs…yippie…  4) Bengali Devdas Dhoti’s – Now this dhoti is very complicated and long…so if your stingy with fabric this type of dhoti is not for you…This style tends to occupy your waist by holding up your dhoti..and your arm by holding the tail. So at all times a man has to drape his dhoti tail over his arm so that he will not trip over it…now here is a scenario.. a bengali devdas dhoti wearer wants to wash his hands in a public bathroom…does he hand over his dothi tail to his fellow neighbor to hold on to while he scrubs his hands clean…I wonder what happens to the dothi tail…ummm…  5) I Ran Out of Fabric Dhoti’s– Now these dhoti wearers are usually poor farmers that don’t have much money to spend on an extra foot of fabric…What’s unique about this style is that they are not fully exposed like the South Indian Fishing dhoti wearers ..these men only show their ankles ..so they leave much to the imagination.. those poor farm girls…now you know why farmers in India have so many kids ..once a farm chick sees those legs she just can’t get enough…naughty naughty…   If any of you guys come up with additional categories please feel free to comment below and let me in on your insight…   also..check out spiderman in a dhoti:&nbsp;&nbsp;   "CORRECTION"   : as per Mr. C-man...he stated that the spiderman in a dhoti link which was available here prior to 07/26/04.. impared his informative personal copyright law..so to all my viewer i'm sorry...

      Had a plain bagel with low fat vegetable cream cheese for breakfast today ..with a large cup of black hazelnut coffee ..duh… I started breakfast at 8:00am and most of you guys now it takes me forever to eat ..so I just finished the stupid bagel at 12:24pm..and it’s now 12:57pm and I’m beyond agitated and irritated…I got a tiny piece of bagel wedged behind my back molars…it driving me nutz.. you would think I would do a tongue sweep, however ma bloody tongue is just not doing the trick.. I refuse to stick my finger in my mouth and yank it out.. that’s kinda gross and knowing me I’ll make gagging sounds that resemble the mating call of a duckbill platypus… I’m totally frustrated not only at the annoying piece of bagel but also at the fact that ma office is below freaking 50 degrees… it’s so cold in here that I’ve lost my sense of control and my brain is not communicating with my bladder properly.. I constantly feel like I have to pee.. and I get a tingly sensation every so often in my index finer and pinky of ma right hand… and I think my eye lids are shivering…ahhh I need help…does anyone have remedies for my dilemmas??? If you have some insight please leave a comment…

      Ok check this out ..while driving to work today I saw the most obscene scene… there was a desi guy wearing a suit standing on a corner waiting to cross the road and make his way to the chutney scented train station.. from the looks of things I came to the conclusion that he must have an upper level position in an IT firm.. perhaps as a senior manager, lead programmer or even a VP of their IT Department.. he stood vibrantly with a leather laptop bag.. and was dressed very well for a man in his mid- 30’s…the light turned red and I had to stop…and I had a great view of this desi bill gates wanna be… I was going to smile at my fellow desi-dude until he did it… u got it… he bloody pinched his nose and blew out snot right on the corner of Wood Ave… I nearly died.. It was utterly pukingly gross.. then he proceeded to open up his $150 suit jacket and pull out a nicely starched handkerchief.. and arrogantly wiped his snotty hands in a rhythmic fashion… I glared at the sidewalk with my mouth dropped open ..there was off-white colored human mucus splatter all over the curb.. I wanted to hurl in ma car.. I was so embarrassed …knowing for sure the cars next to me saw the desi-dude blow his honker in the most vulgar fashion…this obscene gesture makes all other brown skinned 3rd world people like me look extremely horrific… right now I’m ashamed at the uneducated ways of a H1-visa holders ability to suction out snot form their nose…the US government should not give him a green card with out proper demonstration with power point slides on proper techniques of removing mucus from ones nose in a tasteful fashion….that man was a snot head… shame on you…  &nbsp;   Question of the Day…   What was the grossest behavior you’ve ever seen?

      Well it’s only been 36 mins. since I came to work and weirdest things are already happing to me… I was able to find an excellent parking spot in our oversized parking garage…then proceeded to dash down the lobby and jostle my way in the elevator before the doors severed my left arm … by the time I nestled myself in the back left corner of the claustrophobic cube slowly awaiting my 11th floor stop I managed to look up to see 3 old men wearing uniforms…to my great surprise and horrid luck ..it just happened to be a 1) Fed-ex guy 2) UPS guy 3) US Postal Service guy…my heart just stopped and I forgot how to breath… I couldn’t believe my luck …they gave each other evil stares as if they all mysteriously slept with each others wives… I noticed they were all flashing their gadgety things that they use to scan packages…seeing who’s was bigger and longer ..as if they were going to compare their penis size… the elevator slowly made it’s way up to the 8th floor where the UPS guy walked out like a hung over cowboy with&nbsp;two .45 caliber pistols straped on to his one size fit all jock strap…the other 2 men in the elevator showed their Efferdent soaked dentures…I decided that I needed a swig of fresh air ..or else I was going to pass out… I managed to take a small breath ..when suddenly the cables that held the oversized cubed box that was carrying us stopped violently on the 10th floor… I could hear my heart beat so thunderously under my 100% cotton blouse purchased for $17.99 at the GAP…. I knew I was about to see a fist fight between 2 wrinkled men in an elevator that was no bigger then 5feet by 5 feet… I was in no mood for a battle between the best parcel services… I knew I had to make it up to the 11th floor… then I was in safe haven…the doors slowly opened on the 10th floor and the Fed-Ex guy lifted up his size 36 waist cotton/nylon blend navy blue trouser shorts… to prove to the US Postal Service guy that he wore the pants in that elevator during the ride… I nearly pissed all over myself when the US Postal serviced guy pulled out a pen from his rear left side pocket.. I knew that was going to be the murder weapon used to kill the Fed-Ex guy ..i prayed the elevator door would close… soon enough my prayers were answered by no other then “Hare Krishna”…so now it was just me and the US Postal Service guy ..he smirked at me ..as if he was a vampire waiting upon his last meal before the sun rose.. I wanted to blurt out “you know my mom works for you guys too, luv your uniforms” ..and jet out of the door when they opened…I tried to keep focus on the dial on the top of the elevator doors.. impatiently waiting for the number 11 to appear…soon enough they did and I shot out like a bullet from a semiautomatic AK 47… and made my way through the doors…when a hand grabbed my shoulder ..i nearly screamed with fright… I turned around to see the bright blue eyes of the US Postal service guy…he was raising his hand ..i knew he was going to stab me in the eye with his .25 cent Parker pen… soon enough his hand came into focus and he was holding …yah u got it ..my god damn “SWIPE CARD”…I dropped it on the floor when I was placing my keys in my backpack….. I know I’m such a DUMB*SS…   Here’s a recipe of how to make a kRiS Cocktail that I got from  urlLink http://www.go-quiz.com/cocktail/cocktail.php :    How to make a kRiS:   Ingredients:  5 parts mercy  5 parts silliness  5 parts energy  Method:  Add to a cocktail shaker and mix vigorously.  Add a little lovability if desired!

      Ok..check this out..G Masi has 7 bathrooms in her house ..yah u got that right? ..she got 3 upstairs and 3 downstairs and 1 in the basement…. The locations of these bathrooms are…  Upstairs:  1 jack and jill in between G masi room and Anji’s room 1 – 2 entry that leads to hallway and K’s room 1 in guest room  Downstairs:  1 in breakfast area 1 in hallway  1 in master bedroom  Basement:  1 across from maid’s quarters (used as storage room – due to lack of maid)  …now in this 10,000 sq feet house…we got multiple bathrooms that are equidistant from each other…due to convince… most of my time is spent in G Masi’s over sized kitchen or her family room… which is located downstairs… but I’ve noticed the nearest bathroom to this area is the one in the breakfast area.. however when nature calls I’ve found myself sprinting numerous times up the spiral staircase into the guest room to use the potty… I know it’s odd I have to go up 20 something stairs just to take a piss.. maybe my butt is comfortable on that toilet maybe they have this mysterious bond… I don’t know why I can’t use the one in the breakfast area… once masi put me up in the master bedroom (downstairs) cuz the guest room was taken…I’ve noticed that when nature called again I ran up the stairs into the guest room… I know I’m a total weirdo… but it gets worse… u know when u got to go so bad that u start doing the pee pee dance…I still tend go up to the guest room and start praying that my bladder won’t betray me on stair number 13…I know I’ve got a serious problem…I’ve been known to have public toilet phobia ..but this is a bit more serious…I’ve noticed that I’ve been picking favorites in my own home.. luckily we only got 2 bathrooms…and I prefer the one upstairs… the sprint up the vertical stairs is much easier ..plus we only got 14 stairs…I’m hoping I’m not the only one out there with this favorite toilet issue…   Question of the Day:  Do you have a favorite toilet or urinal at your work that you always use..if so why?

      Ok yesterday was a damn scary day..i’ve told u about G Anti’s dog..and how big it is…well yesterday I was outside enjoying the fresh cool breeze sitting on the porch talking to Dr. P… when all of the sudden Sweetie (dog) comes running towards me.. I know she was happy to see me..and she really wanted to play..but hello “u gigantic freak of nature can u not see I’m deathly afraid of u”… well while her 150 pounds of raw meat came running towards me at super sonic speed .. my life just FROOZE.. you got it ..it bloody froze.. I mean I thought I’d see my whole childhood flash before my eyes.. I mean there’s not much of a childhood cuz I’m only 23.. but still nothing flashed ..now the dog was on me and u’d think I’d scream “get off me” but the only word that came out of my mouth was “DON’T” I mean don’t what…don’t pee on me, don’t eat me, don’t lick me…I have no bloody idea what I was thinking of at that point…I mean who say “DON’T” when a dog is attacking you… G Anti started laughing when sweetie started licking my hand I wanted to vomit…I was so scared… I used to luv this dog when she was a lil pup…I remember carrying her around the block like a little baby ..but now man .. this dog can carry me around… it’s so damn huge.. but guess what I didn’t even sweat a tear.. however G Anti said the look on my face was beyond a Kodak moment.. oh well .. I guess I’m afraid of big dogs…I just need to be more aware and work on my, “OH MY GOD YOUR DOG’S GONNA EAT ME VOCABULARY”….   Question of the Day:  What are u deathly afraid of…?  Well there’s 2 things… 1) Sweetie 2) my mom’s vaalan (rolling pin)…j/k..lol

      Woke up this morning to hear intense growling ..at first I thought it was my tummy..i haven’t been eating right for the past few day…however when I got out of bed I still noticed the growling sound… I proceeded to leave the room.. to find G Anti’s German Shepard/Alaskan huskie growling in her cage… all I could do at this point was laugh in my head.. I’m such a dumb*ss… well the poor dog needed to go pee desperately ..and I refused to open her cage.. I mean this dog is huge.. I usually don’t fear dogs.. but this one is a monster… before long G Anti’s kid came down and let the dog out.. I got ready and decided to go to work.. I was half way there when I noticed I didn’t have my seat belt on.. I’m usually anal when it comes to that stuff… I will not drive until everyone has their seat belts on and today …well I forgot to wear mine.. I have no idea where my head is today… I hope god’s watching over me…cuz today I’m a lost cause…

      Ok .. today while driving to work..i hit a red traffic light..so while I sat in my car applying a thin layer of strawberry flavored chap stick to my already cherry flavored lips.. I saw 2 not 1 but 2 Budweiser trucks… they were huge.. I mean I live in a pretty small town where buses, taxis, and trucks are not very common… so now I’m thinking where could these 2 trucks made their dump.. then it hit me ..hello my office building it's right accross the street.. it’s huge.. thousands and thousands of people work there… and we have a huge café with a wall of reach in freezers ready to dispense soda, bottled water, and thirst quenchers…I wonder if they started carrying beer…how awesome would that be… I’d be in heaven… well soon enough the light turned green and reality hit.. “I DON’T DRINK DOMESTIC BEER” (sorry Budweiser) …   Question of the Day:  What your favorite type of beer?   I prefer an ice cold Heineken or a Corona with a lemon..(that’s lemon…not lime..i want the yellow stuff)…. and if I’m in a real feisty mood I can even do Killians.

      Life in High School was great.. had an amazing group of friends … who we used to laugh with cry with and most definitely borrow cloths with…each person had their role in our group… they made a contribution.. I never figured out my role or how I fit in.. but I was a part of it..and for that I’m utter and most grateful.. here are a list of my friends sand their qualities…  Sadhi – Amazing girl who I always fought with for reasons I can’t even remember.. I remember once I called her father a chiea pet and she didn’t talk to me for 2 weeks we had an amazing love hate relationship.. when we were together we used to fight and when we were apart we would long for each other… it was odd..sadhi got all the men.. she looked great in whatever she put on..had a body of a short greek goddess… the girl was able to stop traffic… she was a little ghetto in her ways ..but I luved goin over to her place where she would cook for me… the person who I never thought I’d look up to.. now is my mentor in life…  Radha – My dad said we were made for each other .. just like our names… we fit well.. she was like the mommy and I was the baby.. I remembered whenever a little fight would break out among us usually sadhi and me.. we’d go to radha for advice.. for some odd reason I can’t seem to remember what she told us..but whatever it was .. helped… radha was like a ring master to me.. she made sure everyone was happy…he was wild and adventurous… she was the one who told me sneaking out and goin to parties was OK.  She the one who taught me how to lie to my parents.. she taught me well her teachings came into great use in college ..for that radha I will always be grateful…  Ripal – this girl was so cute.. she came in a tiny package but she could be heard for miles…she never stopped talking… and never procrastinated.. this chicka would have her school clothes planned out on the weekend..so all she had to do was put them on in the morning.. I thought that was odd. She would mix and match shirts with pants and earrings.. she was the fist girl that got me acquainted with manicures, and eye makeup.. sorry rips I stopped using eye makeup… to hard of a task to apply…I remember the birthday parties and Christmas parties we used to have at her house in her basement … sadly I don’t even remember what we did.. I remember eating and talking up a storm.. to this girl I own my shy days too.. for now one can not get me to stop talking…  Krishna Shah – other than having the same name as her.. we called this little one “SHAH”..this girl was quite brilliant ..very competitive.. never against me though I was the airhead in my group..i think they all called me “Clueless” at one point in time… it was neck and neck with this girl and radha..don’t know y…perhaps they were both extremely brilliant…miss shah..had the most interesting crush’s…she would swoon over guys while I’d be thinking about Barbie dolls… always very mature and never really acted her age…she wanted to be an adult when she ws marly a kid… I learned a lot form this girl… if u study and give it your best shot u’ll do well.. look shah .. I did well in college and have a great job.. look I’m not a slacker…I finally succeeded…  Vivek – this man…amazing he suppose to be the “PLAYER”.. “MR. HOTTIE”.. I can’t think of any desi girl who did not want to go out with him at one point in time..other than me.. remember I was never into guys till I hit puberty sophomore year of college..i know I’m a late bloomer…  Mr. Stud..here got all the girls … I’ve never seen him without one.. I once bumped into him at a club my 2nd yr of college and girls were hanging off of him like monkeys off a banana tree..he’s very sweet and charming has charisma, style, and a killer smile.. basically he’s the guy a girl would want to bring home.. NOT!!!..but over all very sweet kid that all of the above girls wanted at one point…   lucky man..no one wanted me.. pooo  See I had amazing friends growing up… hopefully I’ll get to see them all very soon…that was the last time I saw vivek since graduation and sadhi one a year ago at her wedding.. but the reast I really never saw… all I know is that I’m very grateful…thank u all for being my friend..and I’ll never forget u…muha…

      I’ve noticed that recently in the past few years I’ve gain a few pounds in unwanted areas… the reason behind this is 1) lack of exercise and 2) over eating. Lack of exercise is an easy fix…I joined a gym and go there about 3 times a week… as for over eating ..being from a traditional guju family it hard not to over eat.. and living in the states doesn’t help.. here every fast food place has a super size option…and u feel guilty if u say no for a mare .99 cent option… so in turn when while enjoying an over sized Veggie Whopper and super size fries and ice tea.. at bite number 4… I’m obviously full and I still have ¾ of my burger left and all of my fries… however I slowly proceed to eat everything just cuz I feel bad throwing it out.. it weird.. I feel like crap the minute I get up… I do this at home too.. mom’s have ways of stuffing their kids till they blow.. they pour fresh ghee on kitchadi not knowing that they are killing u softly with cholesterol… and they pile up roti’s in your plate thinking that u just got out of the Somalian desert.. and my stupid dumb*ss eats it all cuz I will have to avoid another lecture on how children in Calcutta are starving.. what does that have to do with me…I seriously need to understand that there is no need to over eat.. and it not my problem that in the US they serve huge portions of food… I just have to learn that it ok to throw it out or big home a doggie bag… whatever it takes but not to take another bite after my tummy yells out .. "THAT’S ENOUGH LADY!”   Question of the Day…  What do u find yourself doin that you should avoid..?

      Ok ..most of you guys know how long it takes a girl to get dressed.. it virtually takes me 4 min… I have no sense of style Monday through Friday… I mean my whole goal is to wear clean cloths that are comfortable and that are not my pajamas… today morning came out of shower dripping wet like usual ..knowing in the back of my head if mom was around she’d stab me with her “dhaniya cutting knife” for getting her carpet wet.. I opened my tiny closet and pulled out a red shirt that was recently hung on a white hanger… and yanked out a pair of blue jeans…went to the dresser and pulled out fresh undies and socks ..once again only the socks matched…I have an unusual way of getting dressed I usually put on my socks before my pants I know I’m a bit odd… when I was finally dressed I felt as if my shirt had shrunk in the dryer ..and with the new low rise jeans fashion didn’t want the world to see my backside ..so I put on a long tankie underneath.. so currently I’m wearing blue jeans, white socks, back tankie that sticks out of my red shirt and a cream colored sweater.. forgot the color of my undies ..sorry guys…so it’s 1:18 pm and I feel as if I lost my sense of style.. I mean there was a time when my sleepwear used to match ..along with my undies… I used to plan out what I was going to wear for the week during the weekend.. now it’s just whatever fits and is clean put it on.. and call it a day…   Question of the Day…?  Do you have an unusual style of getting dressed…?

      A friend visited me from Connecticut yesterday and we went out to dinner then a movie… we decided to watch “The Village” by M. Night Shyamalan and represent desi’s… anyways I’m not really good with horror or suspense movies.. when I was young I’d watch Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th.. and have nightmares for weeks… recently I seem to analyze everything…saw Blair Witch and now I have issues when I go camping.. I randomly check to make sure no one left piles of stones out side my tent ..i’m beyond paranoid.. well anyways last night watched a movie that on the scale from 1 to 10 would fall at a 7… wasn’t all that scary however after the movie my friend and I sat in my yard swinging on the family swing and started analyzing the film.. soon after …we headed to bed ..and I being nocturnal just lied there hoping that sleep will take over my lifeless body… while I lie in bed it is customary and a ritual that my brain runs through enormous amounts of useless information that is not even relevant to me.. so basically I’m always thinking ..about stuff that I can’t even remember the next day.. while I lied in bed around 2:20am this morning with my eyes shut tightly knowing that I’m still awake.. I felt it… a large object behind me… I knew exactly what it was …the scary beast from the movie dressed in a red cloak… then I felt him grab my shoulder… I stopped breathing and waited for the hand to release my shoulder… then I screamed as loud as I could all with my eyes closed… when I opened them.. I saw my friend who was lying to my left get up and attack me with her sharp claws.. and bloody fangs….. at that point I shoved my head in a pillow and waited for all of it to stop.. I guess in the back of my head I knew it was a nightmare and I just had to let it pass… about 5 min after I grabbed my cell phone and left the room.. I called up a friend and told him I just had a freaking nightmare and I had to get my mind off of it.. so we talked about silly things and I soon returned back to my room..now I was deathly afraid of sleeping in the same bed with my friend who has earlier attacked me in my nightmare..i grabbed a blanket off my bed and slept opposite the footboard on the floor…every time she would twist and turn in her sleep I would turn restless.. this lasted for about an hour and a ½..soo I finally realized why was I so scared of my friend ..big deal it was a freaking nightmare get over it.. I got back into bed and asked her if she was awake ..she stated “yah”..and then I proceded to question her if she heard me scream.. she was like “yah but I thought I might have kicked u” .. little did she know I was being attacked by her and the beast from the movie.. I told her about my nightmare and we laughed it off… but I think I seriously need to stop watching horror movies… I don’t think my psyche can handle and process them in a logical manner.. yes they are fun to watch but the nightmare aren’t.. so from now on .. I refuse to watch horror movies… and hopefully it will put an end to vicious nightmares…   Question of the Day…  What is it like when u have nightmare…?
