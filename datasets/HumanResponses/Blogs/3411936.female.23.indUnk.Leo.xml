            Maybe it was the feeling of being watched or the tingling of your skin that tells you there is another presence in the room. It was probably for both reasons that I woke up in the middle of that crispy, fall night. I hadn't moved yet. I was just lying awake facing the wall. I wasn't nervous, just curious and wondering how I should make my first move. As I lay there motionless in the darkness I could barely make out a faint fluttering sound like the wings of a hummingbird. The sound was high up by the ceiling and seemed to be getting louder. At first I thought that maybe a bat had gotten into my room somehow, but I figured the sound of a bat's wings would be much louder and not as smooth sounding as what I was hearing. Suddenly I began to hear another noise along with the present one. It sounded like... laughter? Small, high-pitched chuckles filled my room. It was so hysterical sounding that I almost began laughing myself. I couldn't take it anymore! I had to see what on Earth was going on. I slowly began to turn around in my bed and as soon as I moved, the chuckling stopped and the fluttering turned into a loud zip through the air. I looked around the ceiling and didn't see anything. I sat up in my bed and examined the walls and floor only to see my toys and clothes sprawled about. There was nothing out of the ordinary and I was all of a sudden greatly disappointed. I got out of my bed for further investigation. I walked quietly, trying to listen for the sounds I heard. I went slowly past my radiator and quickly peeked behind it before I moved to my dresser. I carefully examined the contents on the top of my dresser and slowly knelt to the floor to inspect underneath. Nothing but lonesome socks and dustbunnies decorated the floor. I stood up, with less cation this time, more frustated now than dissappointed. I knew I heard something! Not only heard it but heard it enough to wake me from a sound sleep.

          So my husband and I just moved into our brand new home down in Debary, Florida. It's so lovely and wonderful and... big. Not that that is a bad thing it's just that there is a lot more to clean. Not just an occasional pan in the sink but try three full bathrooms, large areas of tile, large areas of carpet, and the dreaded stainless steel appliances... ugh! I may be a little obsessive about how clean the house needs to be, ( it's because I don't have a job ) but regardless it can still be a lot of work, AND IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US!      So anyway, It was my first big house cleaning a few weeks back and we had gone out and bought all the necessary supplies. I was actually excited about all of this since it was my first time "running" a household. These feelings quickly faded within the next few hours. I started with the vacuuming and had to empty the canister twice before I was finished ( we're not slobs, it was just the loose fibers from the new carpet were filling it up fast ). The kitchen was pretty quick except for the pesky stainless steel appliances that we bought a special cleaner for and it still didn't work. The vision of my finger-printed refridgerator doors are forever haunting my mind. Next was the master bathroom which I didn't intend for it to be my last chore but little did I know of what the future held. The sinks and the counter were irritating just because we hadn't gotten our water purifying system installed in the house yet and if anyone knows Florida water then you know it shows up everywhere. Not only that but we got these really pretty red towels from our wedding shower that I was so excited about. They're big and fluffy and they shed like CRAZY!! I've washed them many times and I am still forever fighting the battle of the red fuzzies all over my bathroom. They show up in places I would never have dreamed. Everything I used to clean with ends up covered in red towel. When the towels are faded and torn and ready to be thrown out only then will my battle be won. So now, slightly irritated and growing tired, I move to the toilet. We have what we appropriately named a "throne room". Yes, our toilet has it's own room. This room is poorly lit and it's hard to see the kind of damage we did in there. So I get out my nifty Clorox bleach toilet bowl cleaner with the tilted spout so it reaches every spot and I proceed to stick my head in the toilet while I'm squirting to make sure I got it all. Well, about a half hour later, while I was changing my bed sheets, I began to feel very dizzy and my vision was becoming blurred. I felt like I was going to pass out and I immediately stumbled towards the back door. I thought maybe I needed some fresh air. I walked outside and stood there breathing deeply in and out. That was not helping and I was afraid that if I passed out that I would crack my head open on the cement so I went back inside. I went to the kitchen and got a big glass of ice water thinking I was dehydrated. I gulped the whole thing and braced myself with the counter as I closed my eyes and concentrated on being conscious. I had no idea what was going on and so I walked slowly down the hall towards my husband's office and stood in his doorway. He looked up at me and asked what was the matter. I told him that I thought I was dyeing. ( way to blow that out of proportion ). He got up from his desk and came over to me still inquiring about the problem. I couldn't really answer him because I didn't know what was wrong either. He escorted me to the guest room and sat me down on the futon. He asked if he could get me anything and I said some water. He left and returned with water and a pillow. I layed down after taking a sip and he just stood there not sure of what to do next. He asked what else he could do and I said nothing I guess. I felt better lying down with my eyes closed. Daniel sat with me for a while and then he had to get back to work so I said I'd be fine and I just needed to rest. So I layed there on the futon with the room spinning trying to figure out what I was reacting to. I had eaten some celery and peanut butter for a snack a little while ago and I started to think maybe I didn't wash the celery good enough. Then I thought that maybe I just wasn't used to living in air conditioning and I was reacting to that. ( silliness! ) My husband popped in and out of the room to check on me periodically throughout the next hour. I started feeling okay and decided to start dinner. As I moved around in the kitchen, I started feeling much better and by the time we were ready to eat, I was fine. I never did figure out what was wrong with me until just the other day. We had a gentleman come over from a water purifier company to do a demonstration with their system. So we're standing there in front of our kitchen sink listening to this short, balding man with gold chains and a New York accent go on about his clean water and our dirty water. We get through the whole demonstration all fine and good and then we get to the please purchase my product part. He and my husband go back and forth on cost and payment plans and discounts and such. We then decide on a plan and the one we chose comes with a five year supply of free organic soap that works well with the purified water. So now that we have the soap, the salesman starts to tell us about it. He talks about ingredients and ratios and then comparisons. He said something that sparked a recent memory in my mind. The memory being me with my head in the toilet and a bottle of bleach. What he said was, "You'll no longer have to worry about cleaning with toxic fumes and harsh ingredients that are harmful to your health." That was it! After he left I went under my kitchen sink and pulled out that "nifty" Clorox bottle. I turned it over and read in large print, "Warning: Use with adequate ventilation!" I proceeded to go through other household cleaning products that I've been using and they all said the same thing. I poisoned myself by doing housework! Who would have thought simple house cleaning could be so harmful and life threatening. I did laugh about it afterwards and when talking to my husband he started laughing at what he called my pitiful LaChance overreaction. I can be kind of dramatic sometimes. He tells me it runs in my family, but its very amusing! Between my brother screaming obscenities at his computer to my Father flipping out about potatoes in the shower I might be more on the mild side. ( Be thankful we can laugh about it Dad! ) So anyway, the lesson I learned was to space out my house chores throughout the week instead of literally killing myself to do it in one day. I'm still learning how to take care of a house and a husband and this is just part of the fun, right?

         Wouldn't it be terribly frustrating to live your life taking everything you see, hear, and read as the Gospel? I'm beginning to discover how true that is of me. I find a new diet and lose a few pounds and all of a sudden it's the only way to eat and everything else is wrong. Or I read about a new medical study or breakthrough and I immediatley believe it and talk about it as if I were their walking commercial. My favorite one is when I got my shoe inserts for my hypermobility foot problem and sure enough everyone that had foot problems or knee problems or any problem that didn't even have to do with feet needed orthodics. That got me thinking about myself as a person and my thought process. I seem to have a hard time coming up with thoughts and ideas on subjects on my own. I feel the need to have some sort-of solid proof about something for it to be believable to anyone. I guess I don't have a lot of faith in my own opinions. Now that I've recognized this insecurity, I have been working on it. I'm not saying you shouldn't have proof or facts to back up your thoughts and opinions, but just to let that be only a small part of your thought or opinion. There needs to be more of me than other people filling my head with what I do and don't believe. My absolute worst one is this whole terrorist issue. Every time I hear something on the news or radio that sounds the least bit threatening, I immediately become fearful and feel like the world is going to explode or something. I feel cautious when opening mail and leary about drinking my tap water. My husband reassures me that even though these things may be happening that the media tends to hype situations and saturate the TV with reports and news alerts and it can be overwhelming if you let it. So I just need to take in the information and realize the situation and then understand that there isn't much I can do about it so why worry so much. I'll put my energy into other things such as creating luscious feasts and mouthwatering desserts for two people. Want to come over? I promise you won't leave hungry!

           I've been having a dream the past few nights about an alligator and a dog. I don't usually remember my dreams too well in its entirety but these recent ones I can recall as if it were a memory. The dream starts with an alligator resting in a pool of water that has a wall on one end and a half circle of stone stairs enclosing the water to the wall. The stairs are not very steep and they lead up to a courtyard. The alligator is much too big for its pool but it seems to be content. I'm standing on the top of the stairs looking at the alligator. I feel frightened but I don't want to run. There is a small dog that looks like a beagle; he must be mine. The dog is standing to my left and is wildly barking at the alligator. He starts to jump around as if to taunt the large beast. The alligator starts to look agitated and it begins to hiss and move around in his pool. I become very frightened now, but I still don't want to leave. I'm not really concerned about my safety as much as I am about the dog's safety. The alligator starts to climb the stairs toward the dog. It's hissing and chomping its jaws and waving its tail all around. The dog barks more furiously and takes little steps toward the alligator and then quickly runs back. I start to cry and I'm looking around for someone to help and yet I don't call for anyone. The alligator is about three steps from the top of the flight and the dog is right at its face. This is where the dream has ended the first few times I've had it. The last time I had it was last night. The dream actually started from its previous ending point. The alligator was enraged and the dog kept taunting. The dog took one step downward toward the alligator. He barked and attempted to jump back up but he tripped. He fell toward the alligator and cried. The alligator didn't bite him, he just seemed to play and nudge the dog. The dog was now trapped between the alligator's snout and the stair. I was very upset now and I wanted so badly to reach down and grab the dog. But for the first time in my dream I was afraid for my safety. The alligator pushed the dog with all its might up against the stair and I heard the dog's bones crushing and the dog was letting out the most haunting cries. I began to scream and I didn't know what to do with myself. I didn't want to leave but I didn't want to stay. I felt so helpless. The alligator finally opened its jaws and ate the dog. I woke up from this dream immediately. I still felt frightened in my own bed with my husband asleep next to me. I don't know why this dream stuck with me. Maybe because it was so disturbing. I guess the moral of the story would be don't eat sweet potato stir fry with red curry paste in it before you go to bed.
