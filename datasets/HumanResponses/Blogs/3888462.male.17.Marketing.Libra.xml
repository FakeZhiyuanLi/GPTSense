      thats like 5 bucks an hour, thats what i got paid today. Although this seems like a slave wage its not really. I now get paid on commish for marketing crap. I sold 1 watergun for $10. For the rest of the 8 hours i didnt do much i talked to lots of uninterested people. and had watergun fights. All in all it was pretty slack day at the beach. talking to chicks and smoking. I think i might like this job...for awhile...summer...  Apparently ive been told i could own my own office in only 3 months or maybe less. Obviously this wont happen and its just corprate swill. But the guy that ive been working with says hell have one in 2 months and hes been there for a year. and they make like crazy 3500 bucks a week like ordering shit and motivating the workers and finding new ones.  Warped tour is coming next week im so fuckin pumped warped fuckin tour hell yes. Their is one downside no not the fact that i get free hotel, not the fact that ill be surround by naked women and drinking with a fake id the downside is bad religion. Those bastards are playing at some county fair in montainya ye fuckin haaaaaaa, what a fucking bummer i want to see BR so much and now thier not playing.  And whats even more fucked about it is that i got a poster from epitaph in my room that cleary says WARPED TOUR -BAD RELIGION and lists the calgary dates right on it. I will never trust a poster printed by epitaph ever again. Besides thier signing rappers now wtf.  IF ANYONE HAS FOUND A BOX FULL OF CHEAP STUFFED DUCKS THAT SING OLD MCDONALD AND MY FAIR LADY TELL ME.  Red Lobster booked me today i didnt go cause i missed like 3/4 of the shift anyway. they booked me to work at 9 am tommorow, i say fuck that and if i go im gonna be hungover or still drunk.  I also saw bret canham out at the beach and she invited me to her cabin on mon so me and baraket r prolly gonna go drink some beers with them, cheers.  I want to get some really good GANJA and smoke it all.

      To start my first blog entry, Jesus is dead, and if you stick with old ways youll get fucked in the end.   MTV=RADIO   Also dont support radio. If you like some songs fine download them for free off the internet. Radio does not need more money. they are RACIST. so if you support them you are supporting blatent RACISM, mostly through classification. what we dont need is multitudes of zombified nazis. (that is to say not all radio is bad but most corprate radio is crap, we have a nice community radio station that sometimes plays punk which is not controlled by the industry oooo scary thats the radio sadly some punk has become fashionable for the horrible music indrustry to sign further degrading our existence)  And why does the industry just pump out mega stars wheres the losers who still rock.  And why does there seem to be a large flux in the number of fuckin christian songs and mainstream groups with christian attitudes on the radio could it be that they are trying to brainwash and guilt trip the youth into beliving noooo couldnt be or could it. didnt they take enough money from churches and stuff. did i hear rap music.  MTV get off the air. Please for humanity.  This next comment is directed at the citizens of the USA. If you vote for george bush you are a terrorist. George bush is not freedom loving he is filthy liar and murderer.  Now that ive broken this all important amazing new news that no other blog has ever talked about ill tell a little about myself.  I am 17 years old and i have no idea what i am going to do in the future, i have a job but will probably go back to school. The girls find me attractive especialy the attractive ones.. or is it all in my mind nawwwwwwwww they love me. I used to have a mohawk but i cut it so i could get a job working for papercups and minimum wage. I quit that job and told them to shove it. now i sell corprate crap at discounted prices to hicks i see it as a big leap forward as it relates to the thickness of my wallet.  ive decided to skip all the boring english class stuff comma here comma there crap and let this blog flow freely so as the big corprate whores always say, enjoy.  OI OI OI

      "the 'pigs'we'd turned to caricature became far worse than we'd warned, morality enforcement based on the interests of a state, coerced into concordance and threatened into place," -PROPAGANDHI   well last night me and baraket and clint decided to go to rock n the valley,which sucks anyways but we just wanted to go to the after party. Anyways we were smoking weed earlier like an hour before at least before we left the city. So the truck had an odor of marijuana. Then the cops pulled us over for rolling through a stop sign.. Which ill admit was my bad. But what happened next is fucked, they pulled us out said they were placing us under arrest for possession of marijuana(none of us were high) I've been smoking marijuana for a long time I definitely wasn't stoned. So they searched us searched the car and for about an hour they repeatedly bullied us into trying to confess. I heard every trick in the book from the get out of jail free bullshit to the we know your lying don't lie to us crap that cops always use. And what's even wqorse they took a bowl that i had never seen in my life and said they found it near my truck, like wtf aressting me for nothing and now your fuckin framing me fuck you.  It was fucking horrible, they were like "well we know if you've been smoking marijuana and everything in the car is recorded" the cop then went on and played the tape back, which consisted of us denying everything and making fun of the police "Um we've got a black male in a truck, we've found a c plus can could be possibly used to smoke marijuana were gonna need four cars, asap. 10:4" Although it sounds quite humorous its not that's basically what happened. They then let us go and we continued towards craven. Of course after the huge fucking delay we missed the whole fucking after party. And were forced to turn around. So im going down the road at the posted fucking speed limit, I see a cop car with its lights flashing so I slow down to the required speed by law 60km(which the cop said was the law, said I was going it, said he respected the law) and some idiot cop in all black jumped on the road and waved us down, so I pull over and go through the exact same fucking thing as before just a sober as before. But this cop is an asshole and decides that even though I can pass all there sobriety tests that he's going to tow my truck home and make me pay for it. So now instead of being out only 130 bucks and missing the party im out 230 bucks cause I have to pay for a fuckin tow truck.   And most of this money is for warped tour next week.  THE COPS NOT ONLY LIED REPEATEDLY TO ME AND MY FRIENDS THEY ALSO LIED TO MY PARENTS.  FUCK THE POLICE.  "Pigs Will Pay"-PROPAGANDHI     "thought, word and deed once sloganeered, a reaction undefined, the battle-hymn, the mantra of a once unfocused mind. but as logic tempered anger, still inspired but now informed, the 'pigs' we'd turned to caricature became far worse than we'd warned, morality enforcement based on the interests of a state, coerced into concordance and threatened into place, it's not just isolated incidents of cop- jocks kicking ass. it's a flicking war machine protecting the wealth of the employing class! and you pigs will pay in a big way. what a stupid ^ thing to say. you'll pay for the guns that you've used. the minorities you've abused, you'll pay for the blood that you've spilled and the innocent (or 'guilty', for that matter) people you've killed."
