       Wow its only 3:20 in the afternoon so far and already I have already had  quite a day. So. When I woke up I did my usual morning things and then I checked  my email and dA account, which, contained a message from a "friend" of mine  completely bitching about one of my posted photos of another friend. I know that  critiquing is good... but I think that when I woke up so early in the morning to  read a comment whose main point was that my work was shit. Pure, shit. I would  look up the exact quote as it was quite witty- but I dont feel like it.     Anywho. So after I read that I felt like dousing myself with water and soap  so I got into the shower. This was a mistake as everytime I take a shower,  because I am not doing something that requires any extra thought dedication than  putting on shoes, I have all the time in the world to think about whatever I  choose to. This morning it was that comment and that person. And I realized  shortly that it had put me in a very nihlistic mindset and by the time I wrapped  the towel around my head I realized that everyone is exactly the same.     *well see what you want to see, you should see it all, well take what you  want from me, you deserve it all* (spontaneous Modest Mouse lyrics inbetween)      So after I realized that everyone is the same I began to wonder who exactly I  am. I am always troubled by this thought, because no one truely has the answer  to it. Normally I am comforted by the thought of a question that has no true  answer but this morning I was most certaintly not. Thats when I began thinking  'shit where is andy.. where is andy...' I know where he's at--- up in the  Cascades picking blueberries with his parentals but I needed him. :( So I talked  to Michael and Scott instead about it, and I realized that my art is NOT shit  and that it is something that I do to make myself happy and not to make other  people happy. Thank god for friends.     So after that I decided that I really should eat something since for the past  two weeks or so I hadnt eaten anything before four in the afternoon and that it  had begun to be a nasty habit. So I had eggs and then I went outside to shovel  apples that are falling in our orchard and then I washed the cars... My car had  become this ugly shade of brown when in fact its a sort of champagne color... So  I washed it and my mom's car and then returned inside.     Ahhh.. It's really hot outside. My yard is this long, flat, sandy yard and I  hate being in it. That must sound horrible. I hate being in my yard. But there  really is no shade whatsoever and such. We also keep bees so they're always  floating around... thank god they're not the kind to sting, but still.     Besides I got my new Rolling Stone.     Lindsey Lohan is on the cover which in itself is somewhat of a masterpiece.  I'm not gay or bisexual but I find her to be just this extremely hot girl. She's  got curves galore which I always found better than the stick model type, and  long red/brown hair, and large boobs like mine if I may say so. If I could have  any body I wanted I would choose hers. That way I wouldnt have to lose the size  of my boobs to match the frame. See, if you're a model (which i find nothing  wrong with being) you just have to have smallish boobs... mom's calling.. I'll  write more in a few...

       I just recieved an email saying "Jaime- Is your spouse pressuring you for an  enlargement?" And so naturally I thought of Andy who is, not in fact my spouse,  but my boyfriend. Anyways--- so thats who this journal entry is dedicated to. :D      Andy and I have only been dating for about two weeks but  most of those two weeks we've spent either hanging out with each other, hanging  out with others, taking drives, talking on the phone, or talking on the internet  together. Sending virtual kisses because we never get time to get to the real  thing. See, we're not the type to be into PDA's because we're private- ya see?  Now if only a few OTHER couples would realize this... the world would be a  better place. If you'd like to read a better explanation of why this is, I would  recommend reading Emily's livejournal--- frodo_fanatic. She has a lovely  explanation that really beats you to crap if you are into PDA's. They just arent  necessary. For you and especially not for us. Anyways--- moving on.     So Andy and I are quite different, yet much the same...      Sorry for those of you who werent reading this in hopes  of hearing about mon cherie- for those of you who were hoping to hear, this  should satisfy you.     *Sorry Im interrupting for just a moment to announce that  i officially, occasionally, am angry with my family. That is all*     So.  Andy is a tall redhead that is a joy to be around. I  am beginning to realize that our relationship is built upon our ability to be  comfortably awkward around each other. You know--- that kind of awkward where  you trip over things on a daily basis, and where you mix up your words  occasionally... that kind of awkwardness. Its really a great thing though you  see, because nothing seems too embarassing to talk about. So we talk about  everything. Andy's friend Matt is a great guy too--- it seems that Andy tells  him everything and then Matt pipes up with it later while chatting with me. It's  cool though. They're both really great guys.     Back to Andy. So when we hang out I always get this  feeling like I've known him forever when in fact when I first started dating him  I hadnt seen him or talked to him in person for about 5 months. But I feel like  we have a great bond in this way I've never experienced before. Uh oh I'm having  a hippie moment!!! Anyways---- So I really need to go over to Jamie's house to  see him--- I've been going through a withdrawal--- he's been gone for about a  week, and I need to make my mom come inside to help me with dinner so I should  go.... Tata!!

         Hello fellow internet-users. I got a complaint from one  of my readers concerning my lack of upkeep on this journal, so i am updating  currently. Today I went out with Scott and Andy and our original plan was to go  to the Thrift Store in Freeland and then whatever afterwards. We ended up going  to Cassidy's and Charlie's afterwards and watching a few videos and such and  then we left there and went to the firehouse on Saratoga to wash Scott's car and  from there drove to Scott's house where we raided the kitchen and played in his  room with his various toys. For those of you with dirty minds, I'm speaking of  Slinkys, harmonicas and dancing rodents. Then from there we decided to go to the  store for icecream, pizza, pop and candy and then watch a movie at the Freeland  Firestation. It was a wonderful day. I ended it with an Elton John record, a  milk glass vase, and a full stomach. Anywho-- I'm talking to Andy so I will  write more later. I WILL. :D

       Hey Everyone--- Actually I'm not even sure if anyone reads this... but anyways.  So here goes...      So I've been reading  Emily's journal and it sounds like she's up to all these huge great and  wonderful things. Yay for Em! hehe. Speaking of our foreign friends. Traveling  and whatnot... I'm talking to Marie's friend Jon who is now back in Norway. He's  trying to explain the differences between 'jess' and 'ja.' to me. Apparently, it  is only cool if you say 'jess' instead of 'ja.' Ja is too formal or something.  Its cool though...trying to explain the quirks of the English language to him is  difficult at times. I.e. "what is the difference between 'true' and 'thrue'?"  aka through and threw and true. haha. I wish that the cost of traveling wasnt so  high. I'd really like to see Norway and Finland and Europe in general... but Jon  says it costs him $900 to fly here. Too much for me cause I'm poor. :P   So tomorrow I'm going to the world  series soccer tournament game at the Seahawk Stadium. My dad, brother, sister  and her friend are over there right now watching the practice. Which brings me  to what I spent my day doing. I woke up pretty late and was informed of the fact  that I needed to make the 1 o'clock ferry, and then ride across with brother  sister and company, and drop them off with my dad, and then ride home. But when  we caught the ferry we didnt know that my sister had taken the message wrong  from my dad as to what boat to catch and so when we got over there we had to  wait in the heat for another hour until he got there. It is HOT OUTSIDE!!!!!!!!  If I had known too, I would never have worn jeans. :(  But now I am home and  sitting as close as I can get to my fan. :D  Tomorrow should be lots of fun though. I guess that  the tribe purchased a luxury box that seats 43 for two seasons at the Seahawk  Stadium, and because of his place on the committee he requested that he get 5  tickets to every event. So we got 6 for the game tomorrow... so my whole family  is going to go tomorrow, and I got to invite Andy along too. So I suppose that  in my mom's eyes it will be our first 'official' date. When she asked last night  what was up with Andy and I, I just responded with 'well, we're dating' and she  says 'well how can you be dating? I mean-- you havent gone on a date to anywhere  yet' haha. I understand what she means though. Its just old school. Lol.   So this next story is for Emily.  She'll understand. Ok so I woke up this morning and I figured that my bangs were  getting a bit on the long side. So I washed my hair and got out the scissors and  just cut them. But it was one of those things that went "well that doesnt look  quite short enough.. so I'll take some more off..." and now I think that they're  slightly crooked but that's alright. But anyways- Emily will appreciate that.  Cutting of the hair story.  I havent  gotten to take many 'sophisticated' pictures lately. Also known as 'artsy'  photos. I think I'm going to talk to Somer and see if we can hang out again  sometime soon so that I may take care of my craving of good photography. No more  with my Nikon though. Film is giving me hives lately. I cant do anything with it  that doesnt seem to require massive amounts of money. So I'm stuck with almost 4  rolls of 36 exposure that I need to process. :s I'm going to need to beg  Wodjenski to be able to use the dark room. Anyways- I dont even want to think  about film anymore it's giving me a headache.  So I watched Scary Movie 2 last night. I'm not sure  if it was a waste of time or not yet. It's almost embarrassing just to admit  that I laughed at it. haha. The sex jokes in those movies are beginning to get  to me though. I mean, ok. How many scenes can be filmed and put into a movie,  where a guy gets a girl to give him a massage (ok in this movie it was more like  a hand job because it was 'in danger of being frozen off') because he's in  danger of 'hypothermia'? I mean geesh. Be original. I do love the Wayan brothers  though, and that's half the fun of those movies for me.  ^ I dont think I've ever lost this many times in a row  at Spider Solitare :S Must be the heat^   I will write more later--- I'm going to go to the  movie store now and rent something... I dunno what yet. Jon is telling me to  tell Andy to watch them with me so I wont have to be alone. haha. I wish Andy.  ;) So anyways-- I'll be back later. Goodday to ya all.

       Today was not at all the day I was planning on it being, but nonetheless that  made it very interesting. So, this morning Jamie calls me and tells me he's  coming to pick me up to take me stud shopping. So, we get in his car, and I  bring the gun, and we go to Linds to shop for studs. Because the studs have to  fit the gun you see. ;) haha, so we found some, and we go back to my house  to leave again to go to the beach. On our way we pick up Andy (aka xcandyx DA  member) , and then I almost get lost getting to the beach. *bangs head on  keyboard* that's alright though. Ok, so then we get there, and we walk along  and find various smelly objects as most people do when they visit the beach....  and then we discuss everything from hitting a seagull with coins to me in a  coconut bra, dressed up to beg my tribal council for college money. {Its ok if  this doesnt make sense to you} And so we continue home, and we get to my  place where my mom promptly pierces holes into Jamie's ears. They really look  quite good on him. So then Jamie leaves, and I go with Andy to the bank and  to put gas in my car. And, when I get to the pump, realize that I didnt bring my  cash card, and so, I make an ass out of myself for perhaps the 16th time that  day. So... I take Andy home{yet another opportunity for me to make an ass out of  myself--- and yet I managed to. You think that the chances of me doing things  like that would SOMETIMES weigh in my favor} , and worry about draining my car  of gas and being stuck on the side of the road, and yah. But I make it home.  So I head out again, and this time I take my cash card, and I fill my  tank... and head out to rent movies. One was Super Troopers, another Scary Movie  2, and the last was one I'm not EVEN willing to mention on here. All I can say  in my defense, is that I had to find a movie that my brother and sister could  watch with me. And so, I return home. Where, I am about to bake a cake.  Literally. But first, I must add some people to my Cast List which I have  disgracfully left out of my previous entry. Please forgive me *half bows*   Scott: Scott is one of my very best friends. We talk quite often- but  almost always on the phone. He comes over quite reguarly but I have only been to  his house once, and so, I am a bitch. Currently, he has also left me, and is on  the east coast. But that's ok because I know how much he loves it out there. He  really does. He's a east coaster sadly and painfully stuck on the west coast.  But we love him here, and I, never want to see him leave. But, the time will  come {aka college} that he will.  Matt: Matt is Andy's friends. The best  way to describe discussions is this. In his own words: "you know how when you're  talking to someone there is a line? That shouldnt be crossed?" Me: "yes... you  dont see that- I know" Matt: "yah... I dont..." But thats ok. He's a good guy.   Phillip: My ex. Well, my LAST ex. I have quite a few- but dont think  that I'm proud. However- it is kind of nice because I think that I have a better  idea in my mind of what kind of guy I really want to date now. Not that there is  anything wrong with Phillip. But there is something wrong with Phillip and I. I  dont know if he will come into this story very often, but if he does, you now  know who he is.  Daniel/Landon/Brian: They are almost always together as  a threesome, and so, in my listing, they are a threesome. They are all intensely  brilliant, and will be the future's Bill Gates. Plural. Anywho- currently,  Landon has long hair-- even longer after returning home early from his year  abroad in Austria- which was more like 5 months, and Brian.. um... has a pink  mohawk. Hm... Unlike him if you know him. Daniel is fairly normal, but with this  streak going through the threesome, I doubt he will be for much longer.   Aaron: Good guy. I think I may get on his nerves sometimes, but that's  alright. He's going to be going to college this year at Skagit Valley which  means he'll remain on the island, which is a good thing.  Somer: Somer is  a great girl, but never tell her she looks cute. She is very pretty though. She  has a twin, Aliza, whom I havent gotten to know too well yet, but perhaps in the  future I will. After all, I already met her boyfriend. :P Somer took my senior  pictures for me, which are absolutely wonderful, and she is my photo friend. :D  She's an awesome photographer- and I'll never be able to even touch her talent  I'm sure.  Jamie, John, Ely, Jerry: All guys from Ohio that I talk to  pretty darn reguarly- about once a day- however, I have never seen any of them  in person. But I've known Jamie (who's last name is ALSO Barker- and his older  brother, John, has the same birthday as myself --- talk about weird!!) for about  four years. So--- I love all of them and hopefully we'll all meet up in person  some day. :D  Setting for Story: Whidbey Island. The longest island in  the continental US. Stupid fact to memorize, really. About 70,000 people live  here, and we have a naval base up north.. blah blah blah. Its VERY Hippified  here, and I love that about it. More about the island as I continue. Well, more  later but I'm posting this now.

      Hey everyone... Ok so this is my official first entry on this site alright? So I  dont really know how many people are going to be tracking this AT ALL, but I  dont even really know if I care yet... So. What to talk about. I'm afraid that I  am at a loss. Ok, so I'm going to do what all the great, wonderful,  knowledgeable writers did before me, and make a list of cast characters. Just so  that when I write, I dont have to keep explaining each time who each person is.  Ok? Ok lets go.  Jamie: my best guy friend. We hang out on average about  twice a week. We just hash around his place and talk about music, sex,  literature, college, etc. I dont know if there is anything that is too personal  for us to talk about. Its strange though- we're not hugging sort of friends.  Ours is a relationship that is hard to explain.  Emily: My great girl  friend that is currently in Finland. Her and I are much alike- we enjoy talking  on the phone loads about boys and such. I was listed in her cast as the person  friend that makes plans, but we hardly ever carry them out, and I suppose that  up until now, that has been rather true. However- that will change. :P She  leaves for college next year though... and so I will be sad.  Josh: Josh  is my friend that will forever be my friend. He's a wonderful super duper guy,  and I often call him "Haimes" or "Haimesy" or "James Haimes" so not to be  confused. He is a great friend who tap dances and who has saved people's  lives... and if you want to embarrass him, bring up the subject of sex. He  learned to take it though- while hanging out with Jamie and I in the library  last year.  Ashley: Is part of the foursome that is "Ash,Jess,Jaime,Jodi"  we are all in band together, and all hang out at lunch together, etc. More about  that later. Oh- and Ashley's bf is Chris- who I rather find to be a fine  gentleman.  Morgan: She lives down the street from me half the year, and  yet we have never hung out. Ever. Im not exaggerating.  Cassidy: A really  good, rather new, friend of mine. He's like a teddy bear- always there for a hug  and to talk to. He's sometimes there and sometimes away... on vacation, but he  always manages to be there right when I need him. He's a super duper cool guy  and I'm going to miss him also when he leaves for college. He's going to  Evergreen though- where Jamie and I have been plotting to attend. So maybe we'll  be seeing him there. Either way- he's a great guy. Oh also as a side note- in  this drama, Emily and Marie cannot stand Cassidy. Which brings me  to....  Marie: A good friend of mine, who has really been there for me for  years. Her and I are not really the type of friends that hang out every week,  but we talk quite often, and she's a great person. :)  Kaeli: my sister.  She's 14, and she drives me nuts. Dresses crazy, but we're closing the gap  gradually between styles.  Lucas: my brother. He's 9. Knows an insane  amount about just about everything. Ask him about a car part and wish you hadnt.  He's a great kid tho and really cares a lot about everything. Gotta love him.   Andy: My new boyfriend. He's a great guy, and I'm sure that I will have  loads to say about him in here. He's got red hair too which is hot. And this  wonderful, loving, intellectual manner. He's got this awesome personality that  really inspires awe in me. :P Im sure that I'm going to have an awesome time  being his gf... and this sounds like a freaking business arrangement. Its not.  Im sorry Andy- I just cant come up with a description that would do you justice.  ;) Help me out?  And so that brings me to the end of my list. Besides  mentioning my parents. Both awesome, and unlike most kids, I love them. My mom  is the type of mom who notices things like when I'm not wearing a bra and makes  fun of me. We're a very 'open' family I suppose. But I love it. Anyways-- I'm  tired... Email me or leave a comment if you want me to add something. I'll be  glad to comply. :)

       Yesterday I went to the Island County Fair of Whidbey Island. :P It is one of the only county fairs left (I think) without commercial shit playing the role of the backbone of the whole event.    I left at around 11:30 and I met my boyfriend Andy there along with my sister, brother, mom and grandpa. We went through everything---- all the art, photography, quilting, flowers, food, music, ducks, chickens, dogs and farm equipment. Which used to be owned by one Ray Gabeline. Hm. Carrying on--- so we did lots and it was fun....Andy and I left around 3 to catch the transit to the stop closest to my house.    When we got to Clinton we walked for about a half a mile to get to my house and then watched Family Guy till everyone else got home. Then Andy, my mom, and I made dinner and Andy made a blackberry pie for us. Then we headed outside with my brother and well... we beat each other up and chased each other around trying to grab our shoes. I suppose there's no intelligent way of stating exactly what we were doing. When my dad got home we had dinner, and then left for the fair again--- we met up with some friends of ours and listened to some more music, and stole some flashlight keychains. :D Andy and I spent the remainder of the night finding out how to clip the lights onto every 'clipable' surface on his outfit. When they were in his pants pocket we passed a guy that was obviously high staring slack-jawed at his pants. Mucho hilarioso. When we left Andy had them hooked onto every belt loop of his bleached jeans. Hahaha... ahhh good memories. So then we went back to my house and we had blackberry pie, and I drove Andy home. At 11:30 I got back home. I got to spend a straight 12 hours with Andy--- therefore it was a very good day.  :)     Today however, I am going to a preseason Seahawks game. We're sitting in our luxury box but still. It's FOOTBALL. On the other hand---- there is a computer with internet service. And two plasma tv's. And free food. But I'd still rather spend the day at home watching movies on a rainy day with a few elite people.    It's raining in Washington and that's always good. Better yet- it is raining on Whidbey Island. Specifically at my house too.   So I need to go change for the weather---- good deal. I'll write later about how it went. :)

      I feel the need to write... although what about I have no idea. I am sitting here in the dark- listening to the sounds of the Olympic reporting from the living room. I used to get depressed when I was like this- but now I'm really not--- I find myself to be almost relaxed.  For the remainder of the night I am planning on watching some more episodes of Family Guy, painting my fingernails, and surfing through the channels. At three in the morning yesterday I managed to catch the music video for Rollover DJ by Jet. I was happy.  Tomorrow it appears that I am going to be driving my sister and boyfriend Andy up to the drive in to see however many movies we can before having to return home.  I have found myself to be addicted to music lately. All types, all the time, any place. Today alone I have burned.. 12 cds I believe. I discovered yesterday that I had a hidden stash of CDr's so I got to burning them. I have plenty of mixes now.... I'm beginning to think in musical lyrics. I'm going over and over songs in my head all day too. Oh just thought of a new song to download---- "Closer" by NIN.  Well I believe that is all for now.

       Hi everyone. I  have  updated my journal in a sort of strange way... I used to have a site at livejournal.com but now I have 'closed' that one down so that I'll only have this one left. So from about... July 31st on back the entries are from my old livejournal site. I just thought that I would let everyone know.  If you are a friend from my livejournal site- welcome. :) {Emily, Trish}  So not a lot has happened since I last posted... Yesterday was my brother's birthday and in the morning I drove to Jamie's {which reminds me--- Emily I WILL give you credit for the cast list-- as it was of genius material :) } anywho- so I drove to Jamie's and then I got into his car and we went into Langley. We bought my brother his studs and some balloons, and then we went over to Joe's Island Music to pick up Jamie's new guitar and a gigbag. VERY nice guitar if I might say so. I especially liked the strings- they were this awesome color. *stares at strings*  So I went overtown with my family later where we... went to Walgreens so I could buy chapstick, and then we went to Traxx, this indoor racing company that kicks ass. It was really awesome. My brother and parents raced the "go-carts" (they're not really gocarts- but that's what I will call them) and I um... well I talked on the phone with my lover. For um...33 minutes it appears to be. We listened to music... and talked about shoes... and plans for the summer. So then I had to go so I drove my brother up to the Old Spaghetti Factory and I stood outside and took pictures for a while until my Grandpa and mom arrived, and then we had dinner. yay.  So today is my MOM'S birthday- and we havent done anything yet---- they're cooking eggs and working on the network it appears. Im trying to figure out the best way to give her her present. Hm. If I get the time Im going to make her a mix cd too. Tomorrow I think I am spending the day with either my family or Jamie- and then later on in the day my sister and Andy and I are going to drive up to the drive in and watch a few movies. I dont think we'll be able to stay for the last one but I hope so--- It's White Chicks and I thought it looked really funny. :P But its at the top end of the island so it would make for a VERY late (or early in the morning) drive home. It probably wouldnt be over until 2 or so. I dunno. Anywho--- Ok well I'm off to jump into the shower... ahhhh.  I'll update later.

      Everytime I sit down to write a blog I have a moment where I wonder deeply about what the heck I should write about.   "If you're sleeping are you dreamin, if you're dreamin, are you dreaming of me??"  Hmmm I have been so very busy lately.  I dont even know if this is worth posting since I have to go in a few minutes... lets see... Tomorrow is my brother's birthday- and then the day after tomorrow is my mom's. Hm. To add to it, my grandpa is coming tomorrow. Im giving up my bedroom for a week and a half so tonight will be my last night of privacy. :( well ... I'll still get 'privacy' it will just be in the living room on the air mattress. yay. Zippity do dah.  Toodles for now. I'll write later

       Babysitting once again. :) It seems to be going pretty well though. They're tired from last night's Mariner's game.    So I got home last night from work, and got ready to leave for shopping with mi madre. I had a pair of pants that I had to return to Victoria's Secret but they wont take them back at the stores that are in the mall so the 'kind lady at the counter' told me that I will have to pay (more spendage!! yay!!) to ship them back. I thought about telling her where SHE could ship have them shipped to, but only because I've already paid close to $60.00 for these damn pants.       .So then we left. I went into American Eagle and saw all of the amazingly cute sweatshirts... but I was reminded of Marie's words about how sweatshirts dont look flattering on anyone so I didnt buy one... but not because I didnt think that I wouldnt look flattering in it. I buy sweatshirts cause they're more comfortable than anything else. :D But I already have a few... and... they were $50.00.       So then we go through the Bon in search of a bathroom for my mom when I found a clearance rack. YAY for clearance racks!!! I didnt find anything that I really wanted but it was still worth a look. So then we left.       We end up at Old Navy and I went crazy. I got... three shirts, a jean skirt, and a pair of pants. Hey I know girls out there are going "thats not even CLOSE to how I go crazy in a store" but see... I hate shopping to begin with. AND I NEVER buy skirts. Ever. And I hate shopping for pants... well I just hate shopping in general. So in all I got all those plus a courderoy coat at Costco and I spent under $100. :D Not quite as good as thrift shopping, but still I got a LOT of stuff for under a hundred. :D      Now I get to do the fun shopping. hehe.. shoe shopping!! I dont know how well a jean skirt and tshirt would go with bright pink conversish shoes... but I'll check it out. haha.    Today I get off from work an hour early... they have a dentist appointment, and then I'm going to the thrift store, the gas station, the bank, and the photo shop-- Knox. Spending more money!! yay!! BLEH. At least I get paid at the beginning of next week. Im going to do something with Cassidy tomorrow-- we still dont know what, and then on Friday my six months are up!! yay!!! Sorry I probably wrote about that yesterday and perhaps the day before, but it's exciting. To me. And to Andy probably- since it means we can take longer drives. :D      So- music. I know that some of you out there are really into music. DUH. If you're not then you're an insane (possibly republican) person. Ok so here's some good music to download. If you do not have the means to download then contact me through msn and I'll send it your way. Ok here's a list:       --  The Killers -- On Top, Smile Like You Mean It, Mr. Brightside, Andy You're a Star (maybe I just like this one because of the title--- I dont know if I'd like it so much if it was "Fred You're A Star" or something like that. Anyways-- moving on) a few others of which I cannot currently remember.    --  Elefant -- Good band- no idea where they are from or any info at all but I like them. They played at the Neubus too but I missed it. Ok: Makeup, Tonight We'll Dance, and Misfit. Misfit is my favorite but Makeup is rather good also.    --  Polyphonic Spree -- I havent listened to these guys to know too many of their songs, but I like "Light and Day" and someone told me that its on the soundtrack for "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" but I cannot verify that as I have yet to see the movie.    --  Modest Mouse, Postal Service & Death Cab For Cutie -- They are all in the same genre according to Rollingstone.com, but Postal Service and Death Cab for Cutie actually both have the same singer. Interesting eh? Anywho-- They're all really really good bands and so any song of theirs you download is going to be good. For Modest Mouse I would recommend: Float On, Ocean Breathes Salty, and well.. I would just recommend every single song on "Good News For People Who Love Bad News" and "Baron von Bullshit Rides Again". The latter is one that you can only BUY off of modestmousebootlegs.com but it is a VERY good cd. I love it.    .Ok thats it for now about music.    George W. Bush is gracing us with his presence in Medina. For those of you who do not know what Medina is, or WHERE it is, all I should have to say is this: Bill Gates Lives There. You may think 'Medina is hell then?' but what you SHOULD gather from that piece of info is that it is in Seattle. The portion of Seattle that all the rich foggies live. This is a community that refused to pay taxes for the local libraries or police force- because they have their own. HMMM. I think this is funny though because see... Melinda Gates wanted to sign up her two children for library cards at the Bellevue Library (I have spoken to the librarian she spoke with also which I think is hilarious) but they REFUSED to give her library cards, because Medina residents do not pay taxes towards King County Library System. So she was refused. There is a sign on the wall listing the "Gates Foundation- Bill and Melinda Gates" as a major donator to the Bellevue Library. But they still didnt get their cards. Because their community doesnt pay taxes.       These people are damn rich and they wouldnt let their taxes go towards the libraries. Payback's a bitch aint it Melinda??       Anywho-- sorry for this being so long to all of you out there. Ok so George W. Bush is gracing us with this presence in Medina. Im taking my eggs. Jamie and Andy have heard of this story--- ahem "plan"-- of mine. I'm going to take raw eggs to a George W. Bush speech, and just chuck it at him in the middle of it. I figure, I've only got a few more months in which to do it because I'm not 18 yet so... the law may treat me nicer if I get caught.... my parents support this also by the way. I think my mom thinks that I'm joking but now that he's in Medina--- how could I pass up the opportunity!?!?    There's a new name up there---  -Jaime--  my friend who shares my name, who I chat with about sex, books movies and music. We kind of just hang out whenever. He's in Whistler right now too. I know that Jamie deserves a much better paragraph than this about his character- but I have confidence that his character will come through in my stories about our adventures. Jamie-- when you get back we're doing the vodka/seagull thing ok? No but's.    So I guess that has brought me to the end of my rant for this morning. So far only have of my charge has awoken. He wants to go work on 'his road' by the 'woods' aka play boat. Talk to you all later!!    Favorite quote from yesterday: [Andy] Thats what I love about you.    [Jaime] That I'm a smartass?    [Andy] It's 109173841098237% better than being a dumbass.      Yay for Andy and Jaime conversations. LoL. Bleh I need to seeeeee Andy.  :( I didnt even get to talk to him last night... damn. Anyways--- kid got out skateboard. Must be off.

       Ahh... babysitting. There's nothing like it hm? For anyone who has ever babysat for two young boys for an extensive amount of time you know how tiring it is. However, this has become my summer employment and I really do like it... I do... but sometimes you kind of just want to sit the kids in their own separate rooms to keep as much possible space between them as possible, and then crank your headphones to the tune of the Killers or something.       Lucky  enough for me, tonight they're going to the Mariner's game with their parental units and so their mom left me with instructions to just basically let them veg out. I dont know if there is a harder task than entertaining a 6 and 9 year old together. Nothing holds their attention span beyond 15 minutes or so. If I'm lucky. Gossshh..    Ok last night I saw King Arthur. (I know that technically I'm supposed to put that title in italics since its a movie but I dont feel like it so just deal.) Personally I thought that it was a movie that I could only watch once and that would be the end of it. I wanted to go home halfway through! Well actually I just wanted to go somewhere else with Andy my bf because we hadnt gotten to see each other hardly and there we were sitting in a movie theater.       It really was kind of a boring movie though. My mom kept telling me on the car ride home how hot the guy that plays Arthur is, but I think that he looked a lot like Mel Gibson. Cool eyes, but I dont really see myself going for the warrior 'I'm willing to sacrifice my life' kind of guy. Thats probably why I will never date anyone in the US armed forces. Call me a horrible person but that's just what I think.       So we get to the movie and we go with my family (which I can tell Andy isnt too hot with to begin with) and then Marie and Emily find some spots to sit right in front of us. Which actually I didnt mind in the least. Andy kept throwing popcorn at them though. Ooops~!~ Time for a character list~!!!    Cast List-- (in order of their appearance thus far)       - Andy-- my boyfriend. Red head, tall, funny smart guy who shares my love for thrift store shopping. Well, and other loves of mine also, but that's one of the many. We've been dating just short of a month so far but it sure doesnt feel like its been that long. Time flies when you're having fun ;) I'll have plenty to blog about Andy I'm sure.       - Emily--  another red headed friend of mine. Im outnumbered right now!! AHHH. Her 18th birthday is today- I wish her a good one. She's leaving for her freshman year at Willamette College in Salem Oregon really soon and that makes many of us on the island sad. :( But I will make sure to visit her at least a few times. :) She is very politically minded and pissed about Bush like we all should be, and she just returned from Finland which really seems to me like her true home. She's already planning her return during her winter break from Willamette.       - Marie-- yay now I'm not outnumbered-- Marie is not a fiery redhead but a very very very blonde, blonde. But not in any permanent mental ways that I am yet aware of. She's a great friend and is much fun to talk to about shopping, shoes, movies, politics and other things.       Ok so that's who has appeared in my 'saga' so far.     In the background the music of Fantasia cycles... Sometimes you wonder about little kids and how music really affects their 'growth.' In band they've always told us that it promotes more complex brain growth and development but perhaps that was so they could keep us (well more like have our parents keep us) in the class. There are a lot of other kids that I know that are amazingly smart that do not know how to play any instrument at all.     Which has reminded me that Andy plays the guitar. *sighs* hehe. :)    It's amazing how fast my weeks fill up with an 'agenda.' Today and tomorrow I babysit until 4 and then on Thursday I think I am going to hang out with my friend Cassidy (oops another one to add to the list... hold on) and then on Friday I am 'escorting' my mom up to Oak Harbor so that when she turns in her car to be worked on at the dealer's, she has a car to be 'transported' around in. Which is kind of good for me anyways since last time I was transporting them all around we went to Wallmart and I bought the wrong make up. Bleh!~ So that's probably what I'm going to have to do this time also.    Hm... maybe Andy could go with us.. I dont know if he'd like to be subjected to that kind of torture though. -- He'd have to deal with my family all day-- and part of that day may be spent at an Outlet Mall. Which are my favorite type, but my mom seems to be convinced that I wont EVER pick out shirts or pants with my boyfriend within a 10 mile radius or something. The logic behind that... I'm not sure of.    Saturday is my day so far that I am trying with all my might to keep open so that I may hang out with Andy... and Sunday I am going to be the friend Scott's 'date' to his Fireman Picnic or something. He's another one for the list...    Updated Cast List:       - Cassidy-- a friend of mine who is also leaving for college this year--- only he's attending Evergreen State College. He's rather a new friend of mine-- and I havent seen him in about a month because we've both been so busy... he's got a cool Volvo that I love, and he's a cool guy that has tons of interests. I think that's one of the things that amazes me about him-- the amount of interests he HAS. Everything from swords to the prices of 'vagina dolls' on the internet (if anyone is wondering they go for about $300-$400 each) It's astounding.       - Scott-- He will be a fellow senior whom I have known since 8th grade. He grew up on the east coast and I truly believe that he probably does belong there permanently. He gets "east coast cravings." Which I cannot understand as I have never been there in my life. He plays the trumpet and loves Jazz... he's got tons of interests too like languages, religions, and Guinness.    Well I think thats about all I should write for now--- see what happens when I'm bored? Damn typing skills keep me from thinking about things too much before I type them. :P Anyways-- hope you all are having a wonderful day. :)

        Hello everyone---  Soooo how is everyone eh? Im Bored. Yes with a capital "B" too... I'm waiting for Andy to wake up and either call or sign online because I want to go visit Emily. She leaves for Willamette really soon too which makes me very sad. Bleh.     On to other news...so for those of you who would like a new overview of my life and friends and such... *I know that I have already posted this on my livejournal site for those of you who have seen that, but I am starting over* Ok so my family---       My Mom (Karri-- Never call her Mrs. Barker)--- Irish, trains doctors for practice software, is into pottery and scrapbooking.       My Dad (Pat-- Never call him Mr. Barker) --- Native American-- I look the most like him - {Im the only one that got his dark hair} HVAC technician, loves restoring cars and other productive things.       My Sister (Kaeli)--- Blonde haired, glasses, eighth grade, um... is very "girly" unlike me... In some ways we are polar opposites. But when I go through my short spaz attacks of "lets do each other's hair or paint our nails" she's there.      My Brother (Lucas)--- Short, 9, almost 10 years old... knows more about cars, engines, and gears than I ever wish to know myself... good little kid.       So thats my family basically. Save for my schizophrenic grandmother. I dont think she's actually been diagnosed with it but I'm convinced that's it. And my dad has a huge family--- he's the youngest of 8- it took me until last year to finally get all of my aunts' names straight. Ok moving on.       I dont feel like making a list of my friends right now particularly but maybe at some other point in the not-too-distant future. Ok Im searching through my mind for something to blog on about, because if I cannot think of anything to write about then I'm sure that this was a waste of an entry you see?     Phones. I hate how sometimes when you call a person's house their answering machine picks up immediately. And I dont know about you but I need time to prepare in my mind what exactly I'm going to leave as proof that I called their house. So if the answering machine picks up on the first ring I end up leaving a message that's usually somewhat like this:       "hi.... um... this is jaime and I was calling for Bob... NO! I mean Fred... and I was just calling to see um... what you're up to?? so could you uh... give me a call?? thanks"       And then once I hang up I realize that that person doesnt have my number and since I didnt even leave him one to call me back at, and so I left proof on their machine that I am a blabbering idiot. Lovely.       So if any of you get a message on your answering machine that is from me that seems to be quite a bit like the one above, know that it is not MY fault but your answering machine's fault. Fucking electronics.       No, I like the people's answering machines that take like TEN rings to get to the message. Like Andy's. I just call... and wait... and wait... and wait... and ten rings later or so I get to leave a well thought-out message on his machine. Well, sometimes. Not always. But at least I can be sure that he has my number.       Thats all I want to say about answering machines for now.      Hm... something to type about that I enjoy. Nah Im not in the mood. Later--- with my extended friends list I will write about something I like. For now, this is all.      :D
