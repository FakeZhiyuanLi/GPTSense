      it seems like most of the girls in my office of mostly girls are crushing on me. This one chick would be alright if she could get rid of her mild southern twang and speed up the rate of which words come out of her mouth in normal conversation.&nbsp; She also bats her eyes like the hot chick cats in the Tom & Jerry cartoons--you know, like when Tom is trying super hard to impress her like by lifting weights and playing his bass and then Jerry pulls some really slick shit like toss an olive in her martini from across the room and he gets the big smooch and then his whol body becomes rigid and his tail sticks out straight and steam comes out of his ears? It is like how she bats her eyes. Maybe she went to charm school. Or maybe she's just nervous.&nbsp; Regardless, rapid blinking isn't all that attractive o me. Nor is a supersized ass.&nbsp;If it is big because it has depth-think ghetto booty, then ok. If it is big and wide then I gots ta say the nay-nah my damie.  Brian hooked up some wireless internet in our place so that is cool.&nbsp;We can now retire the cans and string we've been using to tell each other ghost stories at night and just send the whole story in the form of electronic mail. BOO!  Speaking of Brian--motherfucker woke up 5 minutes before I came home for lunch at 12:10 yesterday, and only because the FedEx guy woke him up. It's a good thing or he would have gotten a knuckle sandwich for the simple fact that I had been going for 5.5 hours at that point. Fuck work.&nbsp;On a similar note, last night I went to bed at 12:30 while he and Zac got to stay at the bar on the corner and play all night. Fuck work. Will you rob a bank with me?   2ce

      It feels like a fucking urlLink  bomb  went off in my head. Doing the hangover thing (duh) this Sunday morning.   Last night  urlLink Matt Long  came to town. He is gonna be going to  urlLink Morocco  soon so he is doing the visit 'Nati boys in the 'Nati then he is gonna visit the Dirr in  urlLink San Francisco . Probly he will try to have  urlLink gay sex  with Dirr cause you know the whole " urlLink when in Rome " thing, well he will be like "when in San Francisco."   We went to O'Malley's again and drank copius amounts of alcohol. Obviously, I didn't drink so much that I can't remember what I consumed. Here is the run-down:    Before we left:   3 bottles of&nbsp;Konig Ludwig Royal Bavarian Hefe-Weizen  1 bottle of Budweiser&nbsp;   At O'Malleys:   2 bottles of Budweiser  1 Jagermeister shot (more like two)  1 bottle of Budweiser  1 Kamikazee&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 bottle of Budweiser  * I borrowed one dollar from Matt in order to buy one last Bud. I left it stranded in the bathroom over half-full cause I couldn't finish it.  There was some motherfucker who kept repeating stuff we said and mocking us and I guess he said something else to Matt that I missed. Zac wanted to fight him super bad and I kinda started wanting to, too. It's like, hey, you are at a bar and you are in the midst of drinking professionals, they start talking loud and saying crazy shit and you find it necessary to mock them because you are a fucking square and you can't comprehend with 100% of your brain why people would act that way and you are at the same time trying to impress the two ugly chicks across the table from you so they will think that you are cooler than you your two equally dorky friends. Whatever. I hate it when people are like " urlLink fighting is stupid and barbaric " but then they fucking run their mouths and speak fighting words thinking they are fucking righteous or something for not resorting to physical violence. Violence&nbsp;can be&nbsp;verbal too. Don't say shit if you aren't gonna do shit. So I didn't say shit. Though I would have done shit: I was drunk enough.   So we got home and I went to pass out and it was spin-central. It was the total opposite of the  urlLink O'Reilley Factor . I forced 3 slices of bread down in order to soak up the suds, but as soon as I finished the third piece I ran to the bathroom and barfed. Then, all was right in the world and I passed out.   Which leads me to now. There are some ants in our kitchen here and today I'm gonna get some ant traps. I also developed the Poison Froot Loop Theory this morning and I will test it out later. It is what it is.    urlLink Molly  is coming back this weekend for the N.E.R.D. show. So Molly,  urlLink Sarah , me and  urlLink Zac  will go for sure. Maybe  urlLink Brian . Maybe the Zimmer. Maybe  urlLink Jason  cause I just asked him.   Here are some funny jokes from popsicle sticks:   Q: How did the telephone propose to his girlfriend?  A: He gave her a ring.   Q: Where do bees go on their day off?  A: The wax museum   Q: What do books carry when they are away from home?  A: Pagers&nbsp;   That's it for now. I'm outta here.   2ce  &nbsp;

      That is what Dr. Pfister the veterinarian said while I was there Monday. Brew is able to stand without falling, he is able to walk around without falling and when I saw him today, his legs had swollen back to normal size. In true Lance Armstrong fashion, Brew overcame the odds and decided to grab life by the ass and give it a goose. In true Lance Armstrong fashion he did rehabillatory exercise and took drugs in order to stand up and win. (sorry Jason but couldn't resist)  Regardless, I am totally psyched that Brew is doing so well since I saw him Saturday and thought he should be put down. Then the vet said he was even worse on Sunday. Then Monday he lost his fever and he could stand up for hours. He really wants to come home but the folks are gone and I won't be able to get him until Friday. His right eye is a little swollen and draining and it's still tough for him to get up on slick surfaces, and though I would love to have him back tip-top, I know that that is an unreality. I still want to get Brew laid before he dies so if you know any fly bitches hit me and I will get a hotel room, some Hennessey and some 9-1-1 shit for them to smoke on.  In other news we are gonna see N.E.R.D. next weekend the 30th. An OU Molly might come, which would be way cool. I saw her this weekend at Sarah "Don't Try It" Hiatt's house. Good times.   I am now being trained by my supervisor who is decidedly less hot than I found her to be before, though still attractive. I think it's cause she has straightened her hair every day this week. Come on! Women: if you have dark, curly hair don't fucking straighten it! At least not often. I know you get bored with it, but it is the best!  Here is this posts INTERACTIVITY:  I have been wearing these jeans for 12 days without a wash. Strangely, there is only one stain on them what is it and where?  A: What? Grass Ketchup Mustard Coffee Pizza sauce Chocolate Mayonnaise Something greasy: Butter, margarine, fat from meat, vaseline Ink from a pen Ink from a marker Paint Blood  B: Where? Crotch Ass Back of leg - left Back of leg - right Outer thigh - left leg Outer thigh - right leg Inner thigh - left leg Inner thigh - right leg Knee - left leg Knee - right leg Shin - left leg Shin -right leg Calf - left leg Calf - right leg  If you can form the correct combination of the aforemetioned whats and wheres you will score a most non-heinous prize courtesy of yours truly.  I gotta bounce. O'Malley's in the alley beckons. Peace y'all.  deuce

      My dog is ill. Like he is gonna be euthanised in a few days. I had a good cry about it earlier and I'm sure I'll be really sad when it actually happens. So I'm kinda bummed but I'm gonna try not to let it get me down. He is pretty old for a dog and at about the stage in life where everything goes to pot. Barring some miraculous recovery, it is gonna be dust to dust for my dog and my friend.

      So last night was Dirr's last night to hang out before going going back back to Cali Cali. He isn't really going back he got a job in a National Park in/outside San Fran. He will be there for like a year minus Christmas. So last night Barb, Sarah, Nick and Zimmer came over. We were watching World Series of Poker (which I can now stand to watch) and then Jake Dirr came by to see Nick. Everybody but Barb and Brian played some poker with pocket change. I took a lot from Jake on the first hand, but he won even more back a couple hands later. Then he did the funniest thing I have seen in a while. He pulled all his coins to him, like 2 bucks in quarters and dimes and nickels and pennies and shit, then he starts to duck towards the coins and says, "give you all a little of the Scrooge McDuck" then proceeded to mimic swimming over the coins, like Scrooge did in his money bin on DuckTales. If you were there and paying attention you would have laughed so super hard. it was awesome. I was the big winner after Sarah totally bet it all with nothing because she drove and people wanted to leave.  Nick also left a headband at my house which I intend to wear while I drink diet beer. If Nick finds out that it touched my head while my hand was touching a Mich Ultra he will never want it back.  There is a universal machine in my apartment so I think I'm gonna try to start to try to start to try to start to lift some weight again. I also wanna do some other shit like push-ups and sit-ups because I feel like I'm letting it all go.  Say a prayer for Nick Dirr that he makes it California alright.  later  deuce

      Today was my first day at my new job. I was pretty bored. I have a cubicle. There aren't  urlLink hot chicks  walking by all day like at the mall. My supervisor told me that I would be working with 17 other people and that 15 were female. I was hoping some of them would be really hot. There's one girl that i think is hot aside from the supervisor herself, who is a total babe.  I just got the  urlLink Portishead live cd  and a  urlLink Stereolab double-album . So I was listening to some chill shit until I finally got my Strokes cd back  urlLink last night . I have rocked that album about 2 or 3 times since then. It is like only 45 minutes long and I always skip one of the songs so it's easy.  The one song I wanna download/have on cd so bad is "(You) Got What I Need" by  urlLink Freddie Scott . It is the song that Biz Markie sampled for his big hit, "Just A Friend."  ummm...i'm now too busy to write in this.  peace yo  deuce

      Here is what I HATE:  People say that marriage is sacred and they need to keep gays from having the right to marry because they think homosexuality is blasphemy or heresy or whatever or maybe they think unnatural. I kinda think the latter. But I won't get way into that and it's only really unnatural in terms of procreation. It's natural to love and/or lust after people and the people you love come wrapped in a different package or the same package or a different color package, whatever. It's your perogative.  But fuck all these whiny ass retard crybabying about how "marriage is under attack." Two words assholes:  urlLink Divorce Rate . Oh, 49 failed marriages out of 100. That's top drawer. So sacred-ass marriage barely works half the damn time? Gee wonder why? Cause fools rush in? Cause people are so fucking superficial that they don't even really consider marriage sacred, they just do it cause that's what you do in life? Or cause they got knocked up/knocked somebody up?  If you truly devoted to "saving marriage" put down the fucking placards and instead of going to the protest with all the other asshole hate-mongers set up a nice little office somewhere with a big comfy couch and be a marriage counselor. Denying the right to marry to worthy people doesn't make you a defender or crusader of/for what is right, it makes you a fucking jerk.  Bet money that if gays are allowed to marry their divorce rate will NEVER touch 49%. I doubt it would ever reach half that. Why? Well for one, gay people can't go around knocking each other up when they are young and irresponsible. They don't face the social pressure to get hitched like heteros do. Gay people will marry the person they want to be with for the rest of their life, not just because it is the "next level" of their relationship.  As for George W. Bush's statements (get ready for some education): While George is taking some kind of moral (amoral, in my opinion) stand against gay marriage, it is purely political. Duh. It's election year. Gay marriage is what is referred to as a "wedge issue." There are swing voters he is trying to bait into voting for him: left-leaning people who don't believe gays should marry and share the wonderful tax benefits married couples receive.  For the record John Kerry is not a proponent of gay marriage. Have you seen him on TV praising his home state for being the first to allow gay marriages? Do his ads boast that he supports gay marriage. No, that would be suicide to his campaign. On the same token, if he goes out guns blazing that he is against gay marriage, he may lose gay voters, who tend to be liberal. Duh.  Since Kerry was the senator of Massachusetts or Maryland or whatever and they were the first state to allow gay marriage, the general public (who enjoys their news and current events spoon-fed to them rather than reading or researching shit) can easily have the idea impressed upon them that Kerry is homo-sympathizer and wouldn't mind too much if gays destroyed the sacred institution of marriage. Boo-hoo.  Kerry has said that he does not support gay marriage. But he isn't going to be against it and lose votes. Duh.  The message here is: Gay people are people, too and they couldn't do anything worse to marriage than heteros have. If you think God hates homosexuals and is going to send them to hell then you don't know God and you shouldn't even speak His name. Get off. If you think Bush is a champion for morals you are retarded because he is killing people, ours and theirs for dollar bills. People with dignity and integrity aren't really for sale. I'm sure Bush believes that gays shouldn't marry but it's only a fuss to ostracize voters from Kerry.  later  Anybody But Bush '04

      Just like an hour ago I was sitting here looking up pictures of  urlLink lotuses  on Google. Then I went outside to water my mom's eighty ba-jillion plants and my parents put this little pond/big puddle thing by the deck and there was freaking lotus bloomed out the mahfucker. I am probably gonna try to buys some lotus or lily plants or whatever and grow a bunch and when they bloom cut them and hang them to dry. I think that would be badass cause I think sissy shit like that is badass. Anyway, lotus flowers are mad symbolic because naturally the lotus grows up through scum and muck and shit on the bottom of a pond or a lake or whatever and then it comes out and is all beautiful. Kinda like a rose growing through a crack in a concrete sidewalk, you know?

      Last night I was drinking some High Life's and a double-deuce of  urlLink diet beer . I played an  urlLink all-time classic video game  and  urlLink dominated . I ended Dirr's 5 win streak and then beat Sarah with the Houston Rockets.  urlLink The Dream  worked the glass: boards, blocks and dunks aplenty. It was a good game I think I only ended up winning by three. Then we played a drinking game. Then we sort of drank leisurely. Then we went to the Leaf. It's a bar. So we had some  urlLink Sex With an Alligator  and then I did a  urlLink Jagermeister  shot cause I normally don't fuck with whiskey. Even if it's  urlLink pretty good .  Jason and Susie called but I was picking songs on the jukebox and therefore couldn't talk. But that's cool we'll talk later.  I have to play softball today and then over to Long's house to drink more. I have to play softball tomorrow then I think we are gambling again. Vice. Vice. Vice.  Here's a little ditty I came up with after passing some guys on motorcycles drove passed me:  Harley dudes, Harley dudes, Big, fat, leather jacket, Gnarly dudes. Get drunk, ride bikes, eat Quaaludes, Harley dudes.  peace y'all   urlLink deuce

      I took the same  urlLink personality test  as Jason while I was on hold with Verizon trying to get an  urlLink LG VX4600 . The first 7 or 8 times I called, nobody could help me. It almost seemed like they  urlLink went out of their way not to help me . Then they sent me the wrong phone, like I could roll with a fucking  urlLink VX3200 . Pshaw. Where's the  urlLink Organic Electroluminescent  display? There isn't even an external caller ID screen to be found! Like I'm gonna open my phone before I know who is calling me or I am gonna open my phone, find out who's calling me then push a button to talk to them. Sheesh.   My moms is gonna give me some loot to go buy a platform bed from  urlLink Bova . Seven locations in the country and Cincinnati is one of them. It boggles my mind, too. The new digs are dope and I will put some pictures up soon. That way, when you're daydreaming that you're in bed with me you will have a solid image to work from.  This test is bunk, bogus and/or booty. It says I'm sober. It says I'm a hippie, which is pretty right I guess. Whatev, there's some truth to it.  I should be receiving my VX4600 soon, if get the wrong phone again I might have to beat a bitch.  *hugs*  deuce   Wackiness: 52/100 Rationality: 50/100 Constructiveness: 64/100 Leadership: 48/100    You are an SECF--Sober Emotional Constructive Follower. This makes you a hippie. You are passionate about your causes and steadfast in your commitments. Once you've made up your mind, no one can convince you otherwise. Your politics are left-leaning, and your lifestyle choices decidedly temperate and chaste.  You do tremendous work when focused, but usually you operate somewhat distracted. You blow hot and cold, and while you normally endeavor on the side of goodness and truth, you have a massive mean streak which is not to be taken lightly. You don't get mad, you get even.  Please don't get even with this web site.

      I decided a few days ago if and when I get a dog I am gonna name it  urlLink Spaniel Gompers . Don't even fucking think about naming your dog that. I know you wanna name your dog that cause it's the best name ever. Before you were thinking you would just name your dog "Elroy" like that shit was hot. It's not. Go back to Greenland with that mess and quit stealing my name for a dog.  Oh, yeah me and Brian moved some stuff into our place, with the help of Nick Dirr I might add. I am fixin' to move in there soon.   love,  deuce

      k, I just tasted one of my dog's Canine Carry Outs cause they look like cute, little bite size steaks and since I mainly eat potato chips I am kinda craving protein and, like I said, they look like cute, little bite size steaks. I really only want some cookies and candy but there isn't any except I have a Cadbury egg from Easter and a chocolate bar from Christmas in my room but I don't want that dinosaur candy, I want some fresh new shit, ya heard?  So the Canine Carry Out wasn't too good, I really just licked it cause as I was about to bite I got a little gunshy. Such is life. It tasted like a crayon kinda.  peace and scrubbles,  deuce

      k, I'm tired of saying life sucks, even if it does you're not supposed to say it. The truth is I like life a lot so much that I usually catch bugs and throw them out the window instead of crushing them because I think that a bug's life is special, too. You probly think I'm a fag for saying that but didn't you see that movie, "A Bug's Life?" Oh, you did? FAG! If it's a bug that's mad grody sorry bug, forgive me God but I'm gonna kill you or sic my dog on you. And if it's more than one bug then bugs ain't chillin' they are trying to infest and invade my shit. Any invaders to my homestead will be met with hostility, especially if the invaders are little bugs. If some big black dudes were invading my shit they would probly be met with me peeing myself in the closet.  So today I'm just saying I don't think life sucks. Well, it probly does more so for you since your not me how bout some shameless self-promotion? I'm hit you're miss I'm the shit you're not worth pissin on damn that shit was hot straight off the top of my dome.  I have a new job at a law firm in downtown Cincinnati and a new apartment in downtown the same city.  Also here is my hilarious new insult (it only works on girls) it goes like this: "Shouldn't you be pregnant by now?"  OH--here is some crazy entertainment news: Jeffrey Jones (the principal from Ferris Bueller's Day Off (also had a lead role in Howard The Duck--bellissimo!)) got busted for not declaring that he was a sex-offender. 8 year-olds, Dude. Actually I beleive he was 12 and Mr. Jones got the lad to pose for some dirty pictures. Welcome to Creeps-ville, population Jeffrey Jones.

      So I went to the  urlLink Argosy Casino  in Lawrenceburg fully expecting to lose a hundred and twenty smackers. It was me,  urlLink Nick Dirr  and Sarah "Don't Try It" Hiatt. Actually nobody calls her that, I just coined that nickname earlier today. Actually, instead of "coined" I want to say " urlLink minted ." You know? Like I just made that up and it's money. So, on the way to Dirr's I stopped at DQ on Route 4 aka Springfield Pike aka Dixie Highway. Do you think I stopped in for Hot Eats or Cool Treats? Duh, Cool Treats. I got a Blizzard with chocolate ice cream and  urlLink M&M's  (size medium). I ate the Blizzard thinking that it is probably my  urlLink lucky  Blizzard, and eating would cause me to win some money at the casino. I was either wrong or I was right. At one point I was ahead probably about $175 dollars at the  urlLink roulette  wheel. I ended up losing ninety bucks. So here is the lesson I learned today:  It doesn't matter how good you feel or how sure you are that you are doing good things being a good person (being a  urlLink winner ) because sooner or later reality is gonna hit you on the head like a  urlLink meteor  from outer space and remind you of what a huge  urlLink loser  you actually are and as soon as you forget that fact and start thinking you're alright it is gonna smack you down again so it's probably best if you  urlLink don't even bother trying to get back up.   Nick bought us food at Steak & Shake afterward because he  urlLink won  and he is a swell guy. Oh, and while we were there I saw the ex-boyfriend of a cool girl I had a  urlLink two-night stand  with. I'm such a  urlLink dick . I suck.  I may go back to DQ for a Hot Eat: Sarah and Nick both spoke highly of the " urlLink Flamethrower ."  Life sucks.  later.  deuce urlLink

      what the fucking shit is happening? at least 1ce a day some weird ass number calls my cell phone. If it isn't in my caller ID IDon't answer it! I am getting crazy ass area codes, where is 404? I'm about to do a reverse look-up on whitepages.com. I always wanna know who's calling me. It is probably long on Jen's phone in Cali, cause that happened the other night. Never mind they left a message...It was Dirr! Timeout.  k. so while we were at the bar on Saturday, I'm at the urinal taking a piss when some jackass comes in behind me and tells me I have a bald spot. He goes on to apologize and says it must suck cause I'm so young and going bald. So while I piss I try to make this motherfucker understand that I do not have a bald spot and that I'm not going to be bald unless I undergo chemotherapy or something. So I'm standing there and I point at the back of my head and point and say "right here?" He is like "yeah." I'm like "that's a cowlick. Look dude, my stylist will tell you that I have a very full head of hair that isn't going anywhere. The gene for baldness is passed down on the mother's side of the family, and all of the men on my mother's side had hair. It's called a cowlick." He starts some condescending apology and I'm like "find me in 30 years and I will have a full head of hair." I kept myself from saying, "oh, but in 30 years you'll be dead" cause the dude was older and it was really hard because the only reason I said "come find me in 30 years" was to finish with "oh, wait, you'll be dead by then." either way, don't fucking piss me off about my hair, if you don't think it looks good you can say it but don't say I'm fucking going bald cause if you say that to me you might as well just say "hey I don't know my head from a fucking shitpile" cause you will be so fucking wrong. and if you can live for like 40 years and not know what a cowlick is you might want to consider whether or not your head actually is a shitpile. Use the fucking tool between your two shoulders or be a fucking tool. Fuck the dumb shit.  peace  2ce

      I just read the BLOG of my compatriot, Jason Fryer, and have to say that working full-time has not had a maturing effect on me at all. Lemme give you a run-down of my after work activities.  Monday: Poker from 8:30 pm to 1:00 am. *plus driving back and forth between downtown and the wild, wild westside Tuesday: 7 pm--Drove to my bank in Mariemont (the closest branch to me now, no shit). Then to the Cure concert until 11. Back home by 11:30 or so. Wednesday: Me, Zac and Brian went to go to the Red Cheetah but the lines were absurd. So went to some other bar until 12:30 and walked home for like 20 minutes. Thursday: Poker again--this time I didn't leave until like after 1:30. Friday: Tina's for at night. No food since lunch, cannot believe I didn't yarf. Saturday: Brian and I went to Tina's at 5. He left at 7. I stayed until 10--drinking non-stop. Then went back to my apartment for a few drinks then went back to Tina's.  So I am getting my seventh day rest on. Annie and Michelle and my friend Brant came down so we hung out with them. I am feeling like major shit but I drank for like 9 straight hours yesterday. I drank like it was my job. Today I'm gonna go home for dinner and do some laundry and pretty much take it easy.  I am out for now--God bless  deuce

      I was walking into work yesterday, and coming up the stairs I ran into Jennifer, who is in the same department as me, she has a cubicle down the way from mine and I said hello. There is a door on the left, a revolving door in the middle and another door on the right. She was heading toward the door on the right up the stairs and I had been coming from the opposite direction so I was heading for the door on the left. After I said hello she came across the stairs to the door I was going in, eventhough she could have went in hers in like 2 seconds and continue any conversation we were having inside.  She came across, I opened the door for her and asked "how are you?" To which she replied, "Pretty good...for a Wednesday."   NOW WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?  For a moment I thought she could have found this broke-ass little web journal I have and read about the "for a Monday" guy and said that for a goof. Then I realized, "no fucking way that happened" and came to the conclusion that she just says lame things like the other guy, who I will refer to as Bob until I learn his real name. He seems like a Bob. Bobbish, you know? It makes me wonder how one building can contain so much lame, but it does. Tonight I'm gonna go to the grocery store and then I am gonna write something I hope.  deuce

      so working in an office building is thus far just like office space. a couple of wednesdays ago I was gonna meet Geers for lunch, then I said I couldn't, but then I could again, but I couldn't call him before then to tell him I could again cause he was at work and I didn't know his number there. So I went to where we agreed to go thinking he may have gone there anyway. He didn't. So I ate there by myself, no big. But some guy, who is also eating by himself, is looking at me. I notice it and he says "hi, how are you" and I have no fucking idea who it is. He is sitting directly in front of me facing me and there is about 15 feet and two tables between us.  So I walk into the building the next morning and there he is. Duh! He is the door guy in the building I work at and he also helps conduct elevator stuff to somehow not that I gave one or two about that cause even when I was on the fourth floor I took the stairs cause if you notice, most people working in office buildings have big asses and its cause they fucking sit on them all day and they don't even take the stairs for one fucking flight. Not me. No need for a large ass. Never.  So this guy is my door guy and he said hi to me at lunch, so now I always say hi to him when I walk by.  So not this last Monday but the Monday before, the 26th of July--THAT Monday I was walking in and I said "hi, how are you?" and he says, "Pretty good..." then he smiles all devious like he is up to something clever and finishes with a delayed "...for a Monday." And I gave I big smile cause he's smiling and he said hi to me at lunch and he's a nice guy, and I even let out a very fake bit of a chuckle, then opened up the door then went upstairs.  Now this last Monday, yesterday, August the Second, I'm walking in to work, see door guy and I'm like "Hi, how are you?" and he is like "Pretty good..." evinces the same smile and adds "...for a Monday."  Now let me tell you, for someone who actually experiences deja vu (as recently as Monday afternoon- hours after this incident, incidentally) I can clearly say that my experience was NOT deja vu...it didn't even feel like deja vu. Before I even pushed open the door to go up the stairs I was talking to myself (another testament to my sanity) and I'm like "For a Monday? That's all you've fucking got? The same tired-ass line you probably use on every single fucking person that asks how you're doing on a Monday?" Cause you know he uses it everytime, and he smiles like the payoff is so sweet, like it is so goddammed funny that I'm gonna be crippled with laughter, probably miss the rest of the day at work yeah right like why would I wanna fucking be there anyway cause it's Monday. Ooh, look the fuck out! Here comes Monday right after Sunday but still, oddly, before Tuesday same place it has been since just after motherfucking time started and people started keeping track of shit.  I hope to God they don't cancel work on Martin Luther King Day cause when he asks how I'm doing I'm gonna be like, "Pretty good...for a Martin Luther KIng Day." Nobody ever says that shit.  K, I'm off to the bank then to get a sixer to slam in the parking lot before the Cure play.  Peace  2ce

      Here are some links to a couple other blogs I just read about in Newsweek. If you are a nerd like me you will love them, but I haven't even looked at them yet, but I can't wait to. I can't hardly wait, Aman-duh! haha.  the first one is  urlLink PEA Soup . The second one is the  urlLink Garden of Forking Paths . It's like a party for your subconscious mind. I think. Like I said I haven't looked at them yet, but I can't hardly wait, Aman-duh! haha that never gets old.  Dude imagine you are some guy who paints grass that grows and then you watch it dry. If that was your job then your job would only be 10, 000,000,000,000,000.3% less boring than my job. I need a new gig. Seriously, this 9 to five shit is fucking with me. I need a constant state of weekend. I guess that means I have to become a bartender or start learning to play an instrument aside from the air guitar and skin flute (did somebody say "virtuoso"?).  Alright time to go back to boredom city. I paid a bill on my lunch break! I hate my life!  love  2ce
