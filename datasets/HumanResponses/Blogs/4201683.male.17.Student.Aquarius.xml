      This is driving me crazy. Why can't people post a comment on my posts? What is wrong with this freakin' blog!? I already set the "Who Can Post" setting to "Anyone" yet people keep telling me that it requires a password to post a comment. Why? Can anybody help me before I go mad?!

      Just watched the table tennis semi final featuring Singapore. Boy was it exciting. We were SO damn close to getting into the final and thus a medal. The last game was super exciting. The players kept exchanging points, 1 point at a time. We were 2 points away from winning when we cracked under pressure and lost the game. Damn! Looks like Singapore aren't fated to win a medal at the Olympics after all. We just can't handle the pressure. Let's hope we do better next time.

      Some lyrics from some songs...   What Good Is A Heart - Code Red (1999)     (If you have never heard of this song, I suggest you go look it up)  Chorus:  What good is a heart, if you're not gonna use it

      What a day! It started out OK enough, although was a bit tired in the morning despite only having to come to school at 9am, 1 hour later than normal. First lesson was Digital Media and Design e-Learning, which was boring so we shall skip to lunch.  We pondered for a while before deciding to eat at the North Canteen, which was way over at the other end of campus. We had 2 hours anyway so it didn't matter. After lunch, we went to sit around the koi pond, basically to just talk cock and waste time. Then, 15 minutes before our next lesson, Electronics Fundamentals, Derrick decided to play around and his MP3 player fell into the koi pond. (Song Bo moment :-) ) We were a bit surprised and amused, but soon we asked an attendant to help and he brought a net for us to fish the MP3 player out. It was probably useless by then...  During EF, we had a practical test. It was not as easy as we had thought. Many of us did not know how to do. Most of us cheated by asking the brighter ones in the class. Most of us probably failed it anyway, so might as well cheat.  Next was DMD practical. Another test! This time, it was about Macromedia Flash, or how to do animation. Was not too difficult anyway. I got 100 marks! Actually, my creation was quite anyhow, but it was marked on whether you knew how to do anyway, not the final creation. I prefer to think of my finished product as "funky".  After which, we went to Ang Mo Kio for dinner (Some of us anyway). We went to Long John Silver and basically sat around, ate and talk cock. After which, we headed for home. OK, not really interesting, but I was quite tired by then. It was a long day. Thankfully, tomorrow has only 3 hours of lesson (8 to 11am), or 2 hours for those who  jia boh  the first lesson. Still, it's a short day, and hopefully just as interesting.

      Phew. Got through another long day. It started OK enough, with the first lesson being Thinking Skills. I planned to do maths (or rather, copy) during lesson, which turned out to be a good idea because the lesson was REALLY silly and boring. Those who did not turn up for Thinking Skills today (you know who you are), good job! You missed a really boring lesson today. The decision to do maths early in the morning turned out to be a good decision later in the day... After that, we proceeded for maths lecture. With some time in between, I managed to complete my maths. The lecture itself was a bit boring, so we skip to Java lecture, OK? Java was quite a hoot! The lecturer was a real joker. He certainly made Java interesting. We learnt applets today, which seemed quite easy. I handed up my work which I was supposed to hand up on Friday, if not for the fact that I lost my disk. Anyway, after Java, we went for lunch. Went to Food Junction. Had sweet sour fish and drank honeydew milk tea, which was a bit sweet. afterwards, we went to ELP for some of them to do Maths. I was bored so I went to buy a pack of Mentos. Then came Multimedia Computer. We learnt how to combine sounds using sound mixing software and we had a bit of fun. Mine was a little funny but compared to the others' creations, mine was nowhere close. After two hours of mixing around, we finally met our Judgement Day, Maths Tutorial. This was when we had to hand up our Maths Homework. To my surprised, almost the whole class didn't complete their homework, so we stayed back for an extra half an hour. The lecturer wasn't angry though. At 5.30, we finally headed for home.  If that had bored you, I'm sorry. I didn't know what to write today.   P.S.  Those visiting my blog, feel free to make any comments you wish. Don't be shy! I will really appreciate it. Thanks again for dropping by!

      Just realised that I have to hand in my Java (due on Friday) tomorrow, because I was so damn unlucky to lose my Java disk on Friday the 13th (I should've known...). I re did Lab 4 in class, and I asked Yi Xian for some of Lab 5, so I hope I'm covered. Thanks to Yi Xian for graciously letting me "copy" his Java. (No, just kidding. I only used his to check). Anyway, tomorrow will be an interesting day and here's hoping everything will go well. I better not lose the disk again...

      A lot of my friends, especially those from poly, has asked me why I hardly talk. The reason is simple. I don't want to look like an idiot, or worst still, piss people off. Already somebody is not talking to me, probably because of something I said. Even till now, I still do not know what I said or did to make the person angry, but well... The thing is, I have been trained to think before I talk, so as not to say something wrong, hurtful or offensive (Primary school friends, you are responsible for this). If I don't think before talking, chances are, I will say something stupid or even worse, make somebody angry. Therefore, most of the time, I think very hard before opening my mouth, going "Will I offend anyone if I say this? Will I come across as a stupid idiot?" By the time I have made my decision, the topic has changed and I have to think again about what to say. So most of the time, I just keep my mouth shut. Of course, I wouldn't like to live like this. But then again, prevention is better than cure. I know how powerful words can be and how one slip of the tongue can cause irreparable damage to relations, as I've experienced it more than once in my life. I'm still trying my best to open up, but my friends must instill confidence in me too. They must show that they don't mind my occasional slip and are willing to forgive some errors that I may make when talking. That would be a fair trade off in exchange for a more open and talkative Ben. Thanks for reading this. Much appreciated.
