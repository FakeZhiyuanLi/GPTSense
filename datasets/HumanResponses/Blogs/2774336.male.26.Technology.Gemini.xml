       Have you ever watched a movie where there is a train dramatically approaching a switching block in the tracks which is not quite set properly?  The train rattles along the tracks intent on its destination, not realizing that it's wheels will soon be diverted to another track, or thrown off the track entirely.  Hi, my name is Ryan.  I'm on that train.   Last night, after watching a movie, my closest friend and I started discussing my upcoming job.  It's a conversation we've been having a lot lately, since my starting date is rapidly approaching.  I'm a bit nervous, a lot excited, and I realized last night, a little apprehensive.   This will be my first "real" job after graduating from college.  It's a good job.  It's with a good company. It's designing web software for a bank, and it isn't at all what I saw myself doing with my life. That scares me.   I always envisioned myself doing something really creative with computers, something artistic.  Computer graphics or animation or design.  Oddly though, I also wanted to write code.  I didn't want to be only on the creative end; I actually enjoy writing programs.  I wanted my carrier to involve using computers to tell a story.  Writing code, designing art and characters, and maybe even writing scripts, to entertain people &mdash; to make them think and feel and add a little bit to their lives.  That isn't the direction that I seem to be going.   I'm not usually the kind of person that settles.  I know that I want what I want and I won't be happy with less.  Luckily I'm learning to be patient as I get older, but ironicaly learning patience takes patience.  Still, I feel that I may be settling by taking this job.  Not that I think the job is beneath me &mdash; quite the opposite in fact, I expect it to be challenging &mdash; but I feel that I'm settling on less than my dream job. So many people I have come to know say that they started their current jobs after college expecting it to be a stepping stone to their dream job, only to find themselves still in the same position seven years later, ten years, fifteen.  Isn't that what  I'm  doing?   I'm on that train in the movie.  I know where I want to go. The track I want looks rough but is heading in the right direction. The other track looks smooth and straight but diverges. I can see that the switch is set to the wrong track.  The handle that sets the brakes has snapped off in my hand and I'm standing there stunned, sweating. This train  will  hit that switch. I can't go back.  I can't jump off.  All I can do is look ahead for another fork in the tracks, another choice, and wonder if I'll have the courage to make it.

       Tonight I was planning to send out a large email to my friends and family.  My email program was set to add people to my address book automatically, so it was full of email addresses that I didn't expect to be using.  Online shopping stores, marketing email accounts, subscriptions for which I didn't sign up.  I had known about the problem for a while, but because I usually respond directly to emails I have received, I didn't worry about it.  Tonight, however, I decided it would be a good time to clean the floatsam from my address book. I wasn't prepared for what I would find.   I started at the top of the list, checking the names and deleting the entries I knew were duplicates or old email addresses, along with the entries that I didn't recognize.  Not quite halfway through the list, I was stopped by an entry that I didn't know how to deal with.   The entry was the name of my friend and high school computer teacher, Paul Soik.  The email address was valid.  The person was a friend.  Initially I decided to leave it, move on to the next one. But then I stopped.   Paul had passed away over a month ago.   For only the second time in my life, I have discarded the contact information of a friend who has died. It's a disheartening feeling.  I know I'll never have need of this information again but I still feel guilty, as if I've thrown away the friendship and memories along with the phone number and address.  Even though he is gone, I still think of Paul as a friend.  Why am I throwing away a friend's number?   A part of me is glad that I feel guilty.  I hope I never get used to removing friends from my address book. I hope I never have to remove the number of someone who is still here.   Twice recently I've had conversations with people who act as if friendships and personal relationships require constant maintenance or should be discarded.  "If they don't talk to me why should I talk to them?"  Is that really how it is?  Do people really stop enjoying someone's personality, their company and companionship, if that person isn't giving some predetermined amount of attention?  I don't understand that attitude at all.   There are people that I haven't seen or spoken to in years who I still count among my friends, and I would hope that they count me among theirs.  In fact, only two days ago I received a phone call from a friend that I haven't seen or spoken to in over a year.  Between us, It was almost as if no time had passed at all.  We had a lot to talk about of course &mdash; a lot had changed in our lives &mdash; but we knew that our friendship was still the same. It's comforting to have a relationship with that kind of timeless consistency, consistency that isn't a product of diligence or perseverance but of choice.  We choose to stay friends.   I'd like to think that I could call any of my old friends and they would be happy to hear from me, regardless of how long it has been.  I'd like to think that old friends still think of me fondly from time to time.  I'd like to think that the people I've met in my life will grieve a little bit when they remove me from their address book; not because I'm no longer a friend, but because I'm no longer here to talk.   Rest in Peace, Paul.  You've still got friends here.

        urlLink MSN Messenger  is my best friend. Well, several very good friends, anyway.  I find myself chatting online with my friends in Japan several times a month.  The slick little MSN Messenger program is the face and voice of many of my friends that I don't get to see anymore.  Because of the time difference between here and Japan I am usually up long into the morning hours, but I enjoy the connection so much that loss of sleep is a small price to pay.   Tonight I was lucky enough to catch both my friend in Japan, Yu, and my friend in Wisconsin, Sarah, online. It was really good to catch up with them both.  I have actually seen Yu more recently that Sarah, and Yu is almost exactly at the farthest point on this planet from me, while Sarah is only a few hours drive away.  The world is very small.

       And so I begin again.   This isn't my first attempt at keeping a journal, nor my first attempt at keeping a web log.&nbsp; Something always seems to come up, distract me, pull my attention away from diligently logging entries. This time I don't expect that to happen.    This time my situation is very different. This time I'm older, maybe wiser. I have a different life. I have a different job. I seem to even have a different body, but we'll get to that.    I suppose there are an equal number of reasons for and against starting a journal now. In a short 3 days I start my first "after-college" job, or maybe career.&nbsp; My life goes back into a steady daily routine which, contrary to popular thought, will be jarring. Although the hours are regular, I'm sure that the first few weeks of work will not be.&nbsp; Orientations, meetings, group lunch outings, paperwork. I find myself wondering how long it will be before I begin to personalize my desk.    With the new job comes a new income, a new car, new apartment. It is going to be hectic. When will I find time to post into this journal? Possibly not every day, but frequently enough I think. And still, these things aren't the worst of my concerns.    Last year, from June to July of 2003, I lived in Japan. The experience was amazing, I loved every minute of it. I brought some great souvenirs home. I brought home something unexpected as well.   Since a few minutes before my plain landed back on US soil, I've been very ill.  My digestive system is not working properly at all. It is not generally very painful, although it can be.  Most of the time I simply feel nauseous after eating.  Because of this I don't eat very much or very often anymore, hence the new body.   When I started thinking about this journal, I had thought about not writing anything regarding my illness. It is said that a gentleman never discusses his ailments. I considered it for a long while, and I decided that this journal wouldn't be honest if I was constantly trying to avoid a topic that affects me daily. I'll try to complain as little as possible.    So really, what is this for?   This journal is mainly for my friends and family. I'm expecting that the people who come here to read my journal already know me. I can imagine a stranger stumbling across these pages from time to time, but I wonder if any one of these would return on purpose. Conversely, I like to imagine my friends and family returning often to catch up on my life.  It seems that many of my friends and family have moved a good distance away.  I don't see them all as much as I would like, but I hope that they will find the time to read this journal on occasion and maybe post a comment or two.  The internet is a powerful tool, and I hope I can use it to stay connected to the people that I miss. This journal may even help keep me connected to myself, particularly during this turbulent period of my life.    What can you expect?  that's a fair question. I guess it will depend on the day. I may write something interesting, funny, depressing, uplifting, upsetting, or simply a paragraph or two to steal a few precious minutes of your day.   There.  Reading this dull introduction post took a significant portion of your life time that you can never get back. Don't think it was wasted though.  I'm keeping them all in a jar.  In a few months I'm going to take that jar to Chuck E. Cheese and trade it in for that cool bicycle helmet.

       I am simply not a "morning person".  I never have been.  I hate waking up early, I'm not good at it, I don't like it.  Even with all the things I have to do before leaving for work in the morning, I still wake up as late as possible.  Falling asleep early is almost as imposible for me, but much less painfull!   Today I was tired all day at work.  I yawned 142 times in 2 hours.  I'm just kidding, but I did yawn a lot.  And something about the lights in that place is hurting my eyes.  I'm used to working in a dark environment, with only the glow of the monitor to keep me company.  This new office is well lit with lights that don't shine down on us, but shine up at the ceiling and bounce down an even light over everything.  It's very plesant for office lighting, but its still killing my eyes.   And speaking of killing my eyes: I drive home each day through a very very affluent neighborhood (which is probably bad for me because it puts ideas into my head).  There are always plenty of people walking, biking, and running along the streets.  Will someone please tell me why middle aged white men who jog insist on wearing the tiniest pair of shorts they can find?  They are like bikini-shorts.  And you know they don't wear this stuff at home, because their legs are brown but that unsightly expanse of hip they are showing is bone white.  And these guys always run like they're carying a load in the back of those shorts, which, in shorts like that, would be a hideous travesty.   Get these guys some zoobas.

       No post yesterday, my first day of work at my new job.  I was tired and busy last night, not to mention a little overwhelmed.  The details aren't too interesting, but I'll tell you something that is.   The day started with new employee orientation.  Out of the 7 new employees starting, only two of us were going to be working at corporate headquarters.  The other five new hires left the building after orientation to attend training.  Myself and one other woman stayed behind to meet our managers.   My manager came into HR to greet me and show me the way around the building.  I was escorted to my cubicle on the third floor where my new IBM laptop was waiting for me.  I was given a very large book of software cd's and left to install the software that I needed.  And that is when I realized: I was home.   Sitting in my cubicle, watching my computer's progress bar, I leaned back in my office chair and sighed.  During both of my interviews and orientation I had been nervous, tense, and my stomach &mdash; already sensitive &mdash; had been clenched tight in a furious ball of pain.  But here at my desk, for the first time at this building, I was relaxed.  The din of office conversations, the quiet ring of a random phone, the constant hum of hundreds of computer cooling fans all wrapped around me like a blanket.  I had forgotten how good it felt to be in the office.  I didn't realize how much I had missed it.   There was a meeting or two.  There were faces and names and hands to shake, and the sinking feeling of realizing that I had already forgotten the name, the face, and the hand of the last one before I turned to the next.  And of course, there were the stomach problems, but no one seemed to notice them aside from me.  Thankfully it was "Welcome!", "Glad to have you aboard!", "Nice to meet you!" instead of "What is wrong?", "You don't look so good" or "Are you OK?".   It was a good first day.   Today was better.   Today I was invited to a few more meetings, and I received my first three projects.  I was also signed up for training (which is always fun, getting paid to learn!) and started real work about fifteen minutes before I closed my laptop and headed for home.  Tomorrow I hope to be able to sit at my desk all afternoon without moving, perhaps sipping some tea, and get a great deal of work done. People are counting on me to deliver, and it feels really good.

       It was good karma to write about old friends, it seems!  I've received a few emails from long lost compatriots these past few days!  I guess everyone got my email about my new journal, checked it out and decided to look me up again.  I'm grateful to all of you who decided to "drop me a line"!   I have to say it has been a very good weekend.  Since last Thursday, the symptoms of my illness have been very minimal.  After a week of bad effects, I'm able to eat not only a greater amount of food, but a good variety as well.  I think I even gained a pound or two.  &nbsp;   Saturday evening I took a drive out to my Aunt and Uncle's home to visit with them and my two younger cousins.  The two boys and I have been spending nights at each others homes for about as long as I can remember, and definitely as long as they can.  When we were younger, our parents could always expect to be driving home in an empty car from whatever birthday or holiday at which the family gathered.  We made it a point to put on our best  urlLink wheedling  voices and beg our parents to let us stay the night.  I think our  urlLink saccharine   urlLink groveling  had less affect on their decision than our rowdy behavior every day prior; they almost never said "no".   I'm not that much older than my cousins, but when you are young a few years makes a large difference.  I'm just old enough to have had a little more life experience, but not so much older that I can't relate, and the gap is closing quickly.  Its a great way to be and I should thank our parents for having us the perfect number of years apart.   Of course, as I watch the boys grow older, I'm growing older as well. I'm noticing changes in my thinking and personality that I am sure everyone goes through.  I'm starting to  urlLink "put away childish things"  as it were, and am embracing things in a way that I used to secretly ridicule my parents for.  I'm less interested in toy trucks these days, and more interested in family, friends, and good conversation. I suppose I'm becoming an adult, and as an adult I'm learning to enjoy life in an adult way, a much more meaningful and fulfilling way. When I was a child I thought that I knew my family, but as an adult I have begun to know them again, and the experience has been one of the most enjoyable in my life.   I don't remember when I became able to speak to my Aunts and Uncles as an adult.  I can't say that I ever even imagined it as a child.  I always wanted to be one of the "big kids" but never one of the adults.  I could never understand why they would just sit around and chat when there were rooms of toys to be explored.   I guess I just didn't know what I was missing.

       I haven't really eaten dinner today, although I've had too many M&amp;Ms.&nbsp; I just keep craming them into my face.&nbsp; I just really wasn't&nbsp;hungry today, although I didn't really get any exercise so its no surprise.  
 Blogger, great as it is, is giving me a little trouble.&nbsp; It really doesn't want to let me have my embedded XML tags in a nice format since I set the "convert carriage returns to line breaks" feature to true.&nbsp; I've since turned it off, which works for my posts, but it doesn't seem to work for my post template.&nbsp; I've sent a message to blogger support and we'll see what they come up with.&nbsp; This is the first real problem I've had with blogger and despite it I still feel that this is an incredible tool.

       I guess I'm hungry. I know not because I feel hungry, but because I haven't eaten since I woke at 11:00 and made my first post today and my stomach is starting to knot up. Waves of pain come, relieved by belching or a solid gurgle. The pain is right in the middle of my body, width wise, and situated just below my sturnum at the top of my stomach muscles. This is why I believe I have an ulcer. Eating helps, as does Zantac 75 eventually. The problem is that eating causes my other symptoms, which are worse.  urlLink Catch 22 .

       Actually I think I slept through dawn, by about 5 hours. I woke slowly today, thinking of this web log and what I would post for my first 'real' blogging day.  
 I've decided to embed XML into each post, but hide it in comments instead of making it accessable to the browser. The reason for this is that I plan to write a file sweeper that will go through all of the archived posts on the server and compile one large XML file for reporting. That way I can write down my symptoms when they happen but have an easily readable report at any time, of any time. We'll see how it works.  
 This morning I woke with the usual gurgling in my mid abdomen. I would say its in my small intestine but that is a guess. I immediately started writing this after rising from bed and had a handfull of peanut  urlLink M&amp;M's . Yes, I know that isn't the healthiest thing to eat when you have digestive problems, but I have powerful cravings for sugar and chocolate. Sugar cravings are another sign of parasitic infection, but my tests of last week were negative for parasites...not that the tests are 100% acurate but they were my second set in one year.  
 I think that I'll really have to be 'on the ball' when writing this log. I need to pay attention not just to my accute symptoms, but the obtuse ones as well. With that in mind, I'll add here that I did some of my usual excersize last Monday which should not have been very strenuous for me but my body is still aching from it 4 days later. My muscles are sore like I had done serious weight training. My body deffinately doesn't heal at all as quickly as before.  
 The few M&amp;M's are making me belch a little, and the gurgling continues in my gut. I'm sure that intestinal gas will escape as soon as I start moving around. This is a typical morning for me lately, so I don't think I can blame the candies.  
 I'm off to shower.  (*wild cheering from the crowd - who have been holding their noses*)

..and he was off at a run. Well, perhaps it was more of a swagger. Ok, he was sitting. Sitting before his computer keyboard just as any other day of the past year.  
 'Green' is probably not the kind of web log that will win any awards for prose, attract media attention, or even entertain anyone on their lunch break. 'Green' is about me, and more importantly about my problems.  
 You see, for one month - from June to July of 2003 - I went on an amazing and incredibly fulfilling journey to the Nation of Japan, and I brought something back with me. Sure, I packed an extra duffel with me to carry home my clothes while my suitcase was bloated with souvenirs. Yes, I hid some food in my backpack and some foreign money in my belt. The thing that I was unaware of carrying was hiding somewhere between my esophagus and my colon, and it was there to stay, so it seems. 
Since my return from Japan over a year ago (as of the time of this post) I have been terribly ill. I can't say for sure what has been the cause of my illness, although  urlLink Giardia Lambia  is suspect. The problem that has inspired this web log is that it doesn't seem to be getting better.  
 Enter - the power of the internet! With the help of  urlLink Blogger.com  I plan to keep records of my symptoms and hopefully their causes. I'll likely find time to add comments here and there with the hope that anyone unlucky enough to stumble upon this log will find some entertainment. With any luck one of you reading along will recognize something in my story and be able to offer help, or find help with your own situation. So there is the impetus, but what about the name?  
 'Green' is often considered the color of nature and health. Who can look out upon a grassy field during the height of summer and not feel a little more alive? However, 'green' is also the color associated with illness and nausea (at least in American culture). For both reasons, 'Green' is the name of this log.

 So the peanut M&amp;M's are definately a cause of trouble for me.  My diet today was basicly the same as yesterday, except for more sandwiches and less M&amp;M's.  I had too many M&amp;M's again at around 7:30-8:00 and I'm paying for it now at 9:42.  My lower abdomen, below my belly button but just above my belt (I wear my jeans low) is gurgling and I'm belching and passing gas.  One thing I've been noticing with this the past few weeks is that I can't stop salivating when I'm having these issues.  I bet its related. 
 I'm tending to think that the problem with digesting these candies lies more with the nuts than the chocolate.  Other chocolates don't bother me like this, but I have a hard time with mixed nuts.  Is it the protein?

What a rough night.&nbsp; Although I had been eating the same thing all day without problem ( urlLink M&amp;M's  and Water) I ran into big trouble at about 2:30 in the morning.&nbsp; I was still up chatting online and the stomach started to complain.&nbsp; I started belching and within 10 minutes I was very nauseous.&nbsp; It lasted for about fourty minutes, most of which I was sure I was going to vomit, and then it was as if some barrier finally broke.&nbsp; I was able to belch several long and fulfilling times, and it was over as fast as it started.&nbsp; I wish that I understood what was causing all this gas to build up, and what more was causing me so much difficulty in releasing it. 
 Obviously my diet of candy and water yesterday is not helpful to my condition. I don't normally eat in that manner and its really a terrible way to start a health log! Today I'm vowing to do a much better job, and maybe this log will keep me honest. So far I've started the day (at around 11:00 am) with a small glass of  urlLink Pedialyte . Yes, its for infants, but sometimes after feeling particularly ill I spend the next day with cotton mouth and the Pedialyte helps to re-hydrate my body while being easy on the stomach. 
 So its 1:15 now and I haven't yet eaten anything solid. My stomach is starting to have the waves of pain and cramping again that I'm associating with an ulcer, although I'm just guessing at that. I'm going to go have some lunch and a Zantac.

Most of the big dealerships on the strip there have cars that are out of my price range for the 2 years I expect this next car to be mine, but it was worth a try.  Anyway, the sun is beating down today and all that driving around and squinting at the sticker prices has given me a headache. 
 I had a bologna sandwich when I got home and played with the dog for a little bit.  My stomach seems to be doing well today, not too much issue with the sandwich.

 Mornings are clearly the best part of my day (if you can accept 11:30 as morning).  With no where pressing to go, I tend to wake slowly, warmly, tucked neatly under the blankets that have escaped being kicked to the floor.  While my intestines quietly gurgle, I toss and turn in an attempt to find that comfortable position that will send me back to sleep, but I rarely succeed. 
 Once conciousness has fully and finaly interupted what could have been my best day, I rise from bed too quickly and sway a bit as my head surrenders to being vertical again.  Like a timer set on the bomb in my stomach, I can count the seconds until the troubles begin.  There is usually enough time for me to make it up the stairs and into the shower, perhaps stoping for a small bite of bannana bread or sip of juice in the kitchen, before the belching starts. 
 As I stand in the shower, I wonder again why I wake every day with such a terrible taste in my mouth - regardless of what I had eaten before bed or how many times I had brushed my teeth.  I imagine the acid of my stomach, being freed somewhat from the gravity that imprisons it durring the day, creeping silently along my esophogus through the night to contribute that awful flavor to my otherwise blissful mornings.  I like to imagine that the piece of bread or several crackers I ingest after waking are a forcefull counter-strike to the acids night missions, but I know that it's a losing front.

 I have to be more careful when I'm surfing the web.  I was sitting here absent mindedly eating Jellybeans, and I think I ate too many.  I've begun to belch and bloat &ndash; or is it bloat and belch? &ndash; and my throat is getting that tight feeling.  Sour  urlLink Jelly Bellys  are worth it though. 
 I guess I didn't do such a great job of watching what I ate today.  I surely didn't eat enough.  I was extremely bored today, and I do have things that I could be doing.  I just didn't have any motivation today. 
 Since this illness began, many changes have overcome my body.  Loss of weight is a major one and everyone notices.  The one that bothers me the most though is my knees.  All this extra time in a chair or curled up on the couch is killing my knees.  My flat feet are likely to cause knee problems anyway, but I'm only 26 and I feel like I have 60 year old knees.  They ache if I sit still to long, and crack and pop whenever I expect them to move.  I don't like it.

 Well, I guess I was wrong, my intestines are still cramping at almost 8:00 now. It was under my notice for a while though. 
 I'm watching "Windtalkers" now on DVD. John Woo shouldn't make war movies, his style of filming action just doesn't portray war the way that Spielberg does, but then who can match Spielberg...

 My intestines have finally stopped cramping, or at least are under my notice.  I'm eating sour jellybeans, which always put me in a good mood!

       Nausea, Heat 
    
     
 
 
 I just had a bad wave of nausea.  There was an uneasy feeling in my lower abdomen, but nothing specific.  My stomach was not involved, but my throat was constricting as if in preparation.  My mouth still tastes like the "candied" mint chocolate calcium chew, which isn't bad when you take them, but the aftertaste is nasty. The anxiety related to possibly throwing up made me very warm very quickly, and my heart began racing. It's passing now and my intestines are beginning to gurgle again. 
 There was a definite trigger with this one, psychologically.  My mother just walked in the door upstairs from a weekend trip. I already wasn't feeling terrific because I was working on something that was stressing me out.  I hear my mother enter and was expecting she would come down here and want to talk for 40 minutes while I was already not well and stressed out.  That was clearly the trigger for this episode. Multiple Stress Induced. 
  
  Update: My intestines (or at least the area just below my belt buckle) are constricting in painfull waves since the above was posted (3:30 pm and it is now 4:10 pm).  Something is moving around down there, and it doesn't like me.

 A turkey sandwich for lunch.  I already almost forgot to take my vitamins. 
 I ate the whole sandwich at once, which I wan't going to do today, but I guess I was hungry, or old habbits die hard. 
 I had a little bit of a hard time lying down to bed last night, but I was so tired after reading my book that I fell asleep with the light on.  I slept solidly and didn't wake up to turn off the light until probably 8:00 am!

 I don't drink coffee, but I must have my morning intestinal problems. I was fine until I rolled over in bed, then the gurgling started low in my abdomen. It isn't painful, just disturbing and annoying. 
 Today is the day I pay very close attention to my meds and food intake.  I'm going to start a lot of things soon, but hopefully not all at once so that I can try to figure out what is working and what isn't.  Vitamins, Calcium,  urlLink Citrucel ,  urlLink Primal Defense ,  urlLink Perfect Food  and  urlLink Zantac  will be my regimen, along with eating a little food frequently.  I've tried all these things before, just not all at once and not consistently. With starting a new job soon, I need to get a handle on the regimen now.

 I had a small slice of meatloaf.  It isnt too spicy, but maybe more than what I usually eat.  It was only one slice so I thought it might be ok, and so far it is.  I'm drinking water in gulps with the meatloaf (almost a requirement) so there is mild belching. 
 The real reason for the post is that I've had two waves of pain in my stomach.  Pretty mild, and it has been only the two.  Still, I wanted to write it down. 
 I'm still hungry.  That walk did me good I think.  I'm going to eat more, but I'm going to try to wait a little bit.  On the other hand, I don't want to eat to close to training tonight. 
 Update: I just ate a pear, all at once, and I already know it was a bad idea.  The gurgling is hitting fast, low in the abdomen, and the belching is already here. The pear seemed a little acidic so I wonder if that is the cause.

 Tucker (my little dog) and I went for a long walk this morning because I was feeling so well.  We went all the way to the nearest mail box which is probably a mile away.  It feels good to get some exercise and not feel ill durring or after.  I do feel wiped out though, from just that walk. I may be sore tomorrow, and I still hope to train tonight.

 Today I almost thought it was 2003.  I woke without the usual gurgling and the foul taste in my mouth was mostly absent.  I wonder if it has anything to do with how late I took last nights Zantac or that I had so many problems before falling asleep. 
 But, there has to be a balance, so I think that my broken tooth is finally becoming infected.  My gums at the very base of the tooth's root are a little tender. Terrific.

 I was in bed trying to read, but the growing sound of my intestines gurgling was becoming more and more distracting.  I finally had to close my book, boot my computer and make this post. 
 I was lying on my back, mostly reclined.  The gurgling was growing steadily until I was completely interrupted from my book by the thought that I was going to have a very rough night.  Upon sitting up, then standing to walk over to the computer I was able to belch and quiet the gurgling somewhat.  I'm tired and will finish this post and return to my book and my bed.  I wonder if the gurgling will return or if I can get some sleep tonight.

 I haven't eaten much today.  I've had this ill feeling in my lower abdomen all day as if I were about to have diarrhea, but I haven't had it.  It is a hard feeling to describe.  There isn't any pain and hardly any gurgling, belching, or gas.  Its just a feeling like a tingle, and a clear awareness of my intestines, that I should not be aware of at all.  Its an anxious feeling, as if my intestines are expecting something that never comes.  A person could go mad from these things. 
 As is my usual habit when I'm not feeling well, I watched a movie tonight.   urlLink The Butterfly Effect .  Not too bad actually, but not a blockbuster.  It was nice to see Ashton Kutcher in a role where he doesn't say "dude" and I think that was the whole point of this film. 
 I've just eaten a bologna sandwich at quarter to 11 at night and the belching is kicking in.  At least it's distracting me from my intestines. 
  Update:  Wow that was fast.  It's 11:04.  I just finished this post and had half a brownie and the nausea is kicking in.  My stomach muscles are cramping down about every 10 seconds as something inside is doing terrible things.  I know that I have to eat to survive, but when I get punished like this for it I never want to eat again.

 I went to look at an apartment today.  The location was great, the apartment was terrific, but the price was too high. 
 Afterwards I went to my best friends place and we played XBox for a little while.  My stomach was really starting to act up - waves of pain just below the sturnum - so I knew I needed to get some food.  I decided to go home to eat because I still had an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach and the dog needed to go out as well.  I think I'll spend the rest of the day relaxing on the couch.

 Some days this illness has me stuck indoors, bearly moving, not speaking, trying desperately not to feel sick.  Some days its just a general malaise that makes me not want to step outdoors, or invite anyone over.  In either case I find that eventualy movies, games, books, and even the internet lose their appeal and what I miss most is time spent with my friends and family.

 I was way off.  The banana didn't sit perfectly with my stomach, but it wasn't too bad.  My intestines, however, have been cramping for hours.  From 5 to 10 tonight.  It isn't severe, but it is really uncomfortable. 
 I had a bologna sandwich again at 10:00 tonight with the usual belching.  I've been eating too many of these lately and I'm sure it isn't helping, but its just easy to make without leaving the house. 
  Update:  I guzzled some water to finish off the Citrucel for today.  That was a very bad idea.  Firstly, it wasn't enough water for the ammount of powder I was taking, and second it is sitting in my stomach like a rock.  I'm doubled-over while I'm typing this, and the belching and bloating is bad. I'm going to be up late again tonight...

 Thankfully, the problems last night did end quickly. 
 While up late waiting for my gut to settle enough to allow sleep, I happened upon a website,  urlLink www.HelpForIBS.com .  Although I haven't been officially diagnosed with IBS (a GI specialist was quick to make that diagnosis without doing any tests) I was excited and relieved to read the things on that web site.  I gained a little hope that my condition may not be this life-altering forever.  I plan to try some of the suggestions on the web site about dietary changes even without a medical diagnosis of IBS.  Besides, all a medical diagnosis of IBS means is that the doctors know you don't have something else.  They don't really know what IBS is or what causes it. 
 This morning I was rudely awakened by the dog whining.  He didn't have to go outside or anything (I know because I reluctantly crawled out of bed and took him outside anyway) he just wanted to be free of his penned-in hallway.  I can't blame him.  This illness has me caged inside most of this past year too and I would love it if a generous amount of whining would get me out of here, but it wont. 
 Before crawling back into bed (which was still warm) I stopped at the fridge and had several large bites of cantaloupe.  The mellon was in great flavor and although it isn't a fruit I have any cravings for I really enjoyed it...for about 2 minutes. 
 The gurgling hit me quickly.  I almost have to wonder if it wasn't just a concentrate.  I did wake quickly and stand up, then lay back down all in the span of 5 minutes.  By the time I had been back in bed for a minute, my gut was gurgling pretty strongly and I had belching and gas.  I didn't look at the clock, but it only seemed to last for about 10 to 15 minutes. 
 I'm a bit more awake now at 10:30 and my gut has settled into its normal malaise.  A general feeling of unease, although now the waves of cramping and pain are just beginning to hit my stomach.  I'll take some Zantac and try to eat soon. 
  
  Update:  I haven't eaten yet because the plumber is here and occupying the kitchen.  My guts are cramping and making me feel rather ill.  I can't tell if its my stomach or my intestines so maybe it's both. 
  Update:  I used the bathroom at around noon and that release a huge ammount of discomfort that had built up since my last update.  I still haven't eaten much today, but I will soon.

       IBS Pasta Salad 
    
    
       Belching 
       Burning in "ulcer zone", relieve with belching 
    
     
 
 
 I created an Italian pasta salad from my "Eating for IBS" book.  It is pretty good, although I think a whole clove of garlic is a bit much and I may have been a bit heavy on the basil as well.  It seems very healthy though.  I think I'll have a glass of the fennel or chamomile tea before bed.  I'm hopeful that this will help me! 
 I have to say that I didn't realize how much I missed cooking.  I haven't been spending much time in the kitchen lately for obvious reasons.  Even if this salad I made tonight doesn't sit well, I was glad to be cooking again.  It really makes me happy to be in the kitchen. 
  Update:  and an unfortunate one at that.  Only 6 minutes into eating a very tiny bowl of this salad and I'm experiencing an acute burning in the "ulcer zone" - the area just below my sternum.  Is this the duodenum?  Anyway, it burns and is relieved somewhat by belching.  The salad is made with the juice of two lemons, go figure that would upset my stomach.  I knew that it would, but I'm more interested in how my intestines react to the salad.  I'm foolish to eat something with that much citric acid in it.  I'll try a different recipe tomorrow.

 An odd day today.  I woke at 11:00 am to the dog whining again.  I let him out and went back to bed.  I was up so late last night that it was easy for me to fall asleep again.  I finally rose from bed at 1:30 in the afternoon. 
 I took a trip down to the vitamin store and picked up some fennel tea, chamomile tea, and peppermint oil as suggested in the book " urlLink Eating for IBS ".  Then I crossed the street to  urlLink Barnes&amp;Noble  and actually picked up the book (their last copy).  I think I'll read it a little this evening and then take a trip to the grocery store. 
 I've just now eaten my first "meal" of the day, if you can call it that.  I did have half a banana for breakfast at around two in the afternoon, but my first sit down was just now at 5:00 pm.  A bologna sandwich again because its easy.  For dinner tonight, maybe at around 9 pm, I hope to have a recipe from my new book.

 The belches are finally starting to come out now, so I feel a little bit better, but I guess I hadn't been able to feel my intestines while I was nauseous.  My intestines are cramping.  It's already 1:21 am and I've been in this chair for hours.  Tomorrow (or today technically) I'm going way out of my way to take care of myself.  I hope to go to a book store and find " urlLink Eating for IBS " otherwise I'll purchase it online.  Then I'll read a bit at home before heading off to the grocery store to buy ingredients for the recipes.  I don't think I can take 60 more years of this, so I had better get started on managing it properly.

 I've been mixing it up tonight.  I guess the steady diet of the same thing all day has made me crave variety.  I had a tiny piece of brownie (getting old brownie) and some licorice as well as a third dose of cirtrucel.  After this my gut is starting to react.  Gurgling and beching are back at low levels, and the back of my throat is tight or tired.  I don't know what of the three are causing it, but all contain some type of sugar.  Oh, and the headache is still around.  I haven't had enough water today for sure. 
 I'm actually kind of hungry.  I miss the feeling of being satisfactoraly full.  Not bloated - I get that feeling often enough - but full. I would try some of that soy yogurt tonight, but its already 10:40 pm and I do enjoy sleeping.

 Well my stomach is doing well today.  I've been consistently eating small amounts of the pasta salad throughout the day.  Usually there are one or two solid belching sessions a few minutes after eating but that's all. 
 I had two pieces of twizzler licorice and within 10 minutes my intestines were gurgling.  I would be surprised if the two were related - that seems a little two fast for an intestinal reaction - but who knows. 
 Overall so far today: low belching, no gurgling except a little after licorice, and a major head ache.

 I woke probably an hour ago, but spent time slipping in and out of sleep.  The past two nights I've woken on my stomach, which is something I can never do if I'm not feeling well.  I've also been quite sweaty when I wake up, which was common before I was ill, but hasn't happened much recently.  I'm taking these both as good signs. 
 I'm counting yesterday in the "wins" column.  I slept very well.  I didn't feel ill at all (or close to not at all) when I was sitting in bed reading - preparing to sleep.  I also feel good this morning. The chamomile tea I drank before bed didn't cause any belching, however I did get some mild belching after I snuck up stairs to eat a tiny piece of brownie.  I don't know if it was the movement or the brownie that was the catalyst. Also, I didn't eat very much yesterday or the two days before.  Was it the food I ate, or the food I didn't eat that kept me feeling well this past day?  Why did the Citrucel I guzzled two nights ago trigger a major bloating and nausea attack, but the whole cup of chamomile tea didn't? 
 Today I'm going to do my best to stick to items in the new book and eat very small portions.  I'm going to try to eat more than I did yesterday, and I'm going to include the full dose of Citrucel today as well (which I've been skipping every other day it seems).  I'm going to read more from my book that just the recipe I make, and I'm going to keep the peppermint on my person in case of a bloating or belching attack.  I feel like a soldier preparing for battle.  Lets see how this works.

 I really am.  I'm getting excited because I'm hopefull about this new book.  I had 3 tiny (custard) bowls of the pasta salad tonight over a period of probably 3 hours. I'm sure I could have eaten faster, but why push it.  The pain I described in the last post was very brief and only with the first bowl.  I have left-overs and I think that will make a great lunch tomorrow. 
 Right now I'm sitting in front of my computer in a dimly lit room, typing in my journal and drinking chamomile tea (another suggestion from " urlLink Eating for IBS ").  I am turning into a bonifed tree-hugging hippie, albiet a yuppie one.  I guess that makes me a yippie. I spent my afternoon in a vitamin store, my evening cooking a "whole foods" meal, and my night sipping organic tea.  If I were a woman I'd stop shaving my legs right now. 
 This tea is really very tasty.  I don't remember if I've ever had chamomile before, but I'm so used to tea being bitter.  This isn't at all, its very sweet.  It tastes a little like honey.  Hmm, that sounds good.  I'll add some honey to my tea tomorrow.  I'm a little concerned that sipping this tea will cause more belching and gas.  I guess its a wait-and-see scenario.  I hope, at least, that belching chamomile will taste like chamomile.  That wouldn't be so bad. ;-)

 The Simple White Fish with Lemon recipe in the cookbook is pretty good, although I think that this recipe is a little heavy on the garlic as well.  I thought I may have problems with the first filet of fish, but my stomach settled and I was able to eat another one and a half pieces around 8:50 pm. 
 I wanted to try the Orange Cranberry bread while it was warm, so I'm having a piece now at around 9:30 with a cup of chamomile tea. I'm having a little bloating and belching, but not too bad. 
 Again, I'm happy with the recipes in the book.  The bread is particularly good considering it has no dairy in it at all!  I'm sure I'll have another piece before I turn in for the night. 
 In another act of culinary bravery I decided to pick up a bag of vegetable based mozzarella cheese and was pleasantly surprised at the flavor.  The consistency is a little grainy but simply being able to enjoy that mozzarella flavor again makes it easy to overlook.  The company name is  urlLink Galaxy Nutritional Foods  and the brand name is "Veggie Brand". 
  Update:  I am starting to get some strong gurgling\moving gas feelings in my lower abdomen beneath my belt buckle.  The feeling passes - southwardly - and I'm on my way. After all the fish and bread, I actually almost feel full.  A lot of the feeling is food, but some is bloating.  Still, if I could get my act together earlier in the day I think I might be able to gain some weight back.  The symptoms that I have been having with the food (mainly the belching and bloating that can lead to nausea) is still troublesome to certain activities like exercising. 
  Update:  The moving gas in my intestines has stopped (released) but the bloating in my stomach is turning to nausea.  Perhaps I did eat too much too quickly.  Perhaps there was too much spice or garlic on the fish.  I don't know.  I'll post the time that I'm able to belch enough to end the nausea. 
  Update: The nausea was gone in about a half hour.  The gurgling has continued.

 I left to pick up my mother from the "park and ride" after a long trip, and my intestines started to protest.  Anxiety started to get the better of me on the way there, but I was able to calm down and overcome it by the time I arrived.  Now that I'm home, there is still a mild gurgling behind my belt.

 On a whim I picked up some soy yogurt from the grocery store.  The brand is  urlLink Silk  and the flavor is  urlLink strawberry banana .  I have to say that the product is VERY GOOD!  There is a bit of an odd taste at first, if you are very familiar with yogurt, but overall it is an exceptionaly similar product to yogurt, and for someone like me who can no longer tolerate dairy, this is a great find!  I'll definately get more of this in the future. 
 I hadn't eaten much this morning so when my stomach started to complain around 2:30 I wasn't suprised.  It was the usual waves of pain in the upper abdomen, releived by a big gurgle or belching.  I had a piece of sourdough bread and it calmed down.  I have to be more careful to eat more often.

 After eating the pasta salad recipe all day yesterday from the "Eating For IBS" cookbook I had a bowel movement this afternoon that was almost normal! Since I've been ill, my stool has been very odd in many ways but this afternoon it was very usual in many ways.  The only thing I noticed that was out of the ordinary was that it was extremely greasy on the outside.  My understanding is that this is a commong symptom of malabsorption, where the body doesn't correctly absorb the fat content in your diet.  I can't imagine what fat I ate yesterday.  Regardless, I'm mostly pleased with the results.

 I can vaugely remember having bad stomach pains around 8:40 am this morning but I was only half awake, thankfully.  I do remember having nightmares.  I have just risen from bed at 11:25 am although I've been awake for some time.  I have a little belching as usual. 
 There is a banana upstairs with my name on it. Half before I shower and half sometime after.  Maybe I'll try that soy yogurt today, and I hope to make another recipe from my book today.  I wanted to make one yesterday, but the pasta salad lasted all day.

 My intestines are gurgling and cramping a little bit.  Could it be the Wheat Thins?  I hope not, I like them and they should be a good source of fiber.  Ah, box says 16 crackers are only 1g of fiber.  There are better sources. Also, although the variety that I ate are low fat, they are still high sodium. 
 Again the tea doens't seem to be making me belch, but I almost wish it would to get rid of this uneasy feeling in my gut. I still feel like eating more, but I probably wont.

 Seeing my aunt and uncle again was great!  They both look very well.  My aunt has dyed her hair blonde now, and my uncle's dark hair and beard is about half grey and very distinguished. 
 I didn't eat much at the reunion, just a few pretzels and carrots.  When I got home at 8:00 pm I had a couple slices of the orange cranberry bread and the other half of the soy yogurt.  I also took a quarter dose of Citrucel and a vitamin.  I likely wont eat again until almost 10:00. 
  Update:  My intestines are crampling and gurgling slightly. 
  Update:  Wow!  The soy cheese melts really well!  I'd say even better than real cheese! No oily puddles when I melted the "Veggie Shreds" mozzeralla substitue over some Ritz crackers.  Great! 
 My intestines are still tight and gurgling a little (at 10:17 pm). 
  Update:  I'm getting nausiated with high bloating and belching, similar to last night.  The only thing I didn't eat the same tonight is the fish, but I had more cheese and crackers tonight.  Is it the bread or the cheese?  Or doesn't it matter...

 Today, I woke well but quite sore as if I had been doing a lot of exercising yesterday.  I can't think of any activity I would have done to make my muscles that way, so it must have been dietary.  I didn't drink very much water yesterday so maybe it's an effect of being slightly dehydrated. 
 I only woke at 11:30 today, on my stomach again which I'm still counting as a good sign.  I was a little sweaty again this morning even though I removed a large blanket from my bed. 
 After rising from bed I only had a very slight amount of gurgling in my abdomen.  I had a slice of orange cranberry bread, half before and half after my shower, followed by a large guzzle of room temperature water.  The water caused one large belch so far but it usually does more than that over time (especially when I drink a lot at once).  I'm not going to be home for the whole day today so I have to carefully consider my eating plans.  I want to eat most of my food in the early part of the afternoon and much less at night.  In this way I hope I can avoid a repeat of last night. 
  Update:  The belching is continuing at a low level, and I have a slight bit of pain in waves in my upper abdomen (stomach).  I'm going to eat some oatmeal. 
  Update:  I had about half a bowl of hot oatmeal 10 minutes ago.  I'm belching and bloating a bit, with gas, but the most distressing part is that the back of my throat is burning a little.  Is this acid reflux? 
  Update:  I've finished off the rest of the bowl of oatmeal now at 2:15 pm.  The belching and bloating is getting bad, but not debilitating yet.  I'm having mild cramps in my lower abdomen, and when I belch I can still taste the orange in the bread I had hours ago. 
  Update:  I've been feeling alright for maybe a half hour, fourty minutes now (its 2:45 pm).  I may be able to go see my uncle today afterall!  I don't think I'll eat for a few hours though.  The belching is still around, but not too bad.

 I picked up some "Veggie" brand soy cheddar substitute and ate it with Ritz crackers.  The mozzerella is much better than the cheddar.  I had probably more crackers than I should have, and I'm getting the usual response to eating; bloating and belching. 
  Update:  I've been snacking on Sweedish Fish candy for a few minutes, on top of the crackers and cheese.  Ofcourse its a bad idea, but I don't much care tonight.  I'm just upset about having to leave class early again this evening.  The bloating and belching is continuing, with a low level of nausea.

 Bowel movement at 10:45 pm.  Small and broke apart easily.  Slightly greasy.  My gut feels a little better after moving that, but as usual there is always a hollow feeling afterwards, and it seems like my intestines rush to catch up.

 I had whitefish with lemon and herbs for lunch (see last post) and now when I belch I taste garlic and rosemary.  I suppose that isn't too unusual considering the ammount of each in the recipe. 
 My intestines feel full, bloated, and I am having gas but not enough to expunge the feeling.  It's a bit odd to feel my  intestines  full as opposed to my stomach.  It's a much lower feeling than what I remember over-eating to feel like.  I wish it would go away so I would feel more like training tonight. 
  Update:  So I had some peppermint extract drops (alchohol free) and a little orange flavored Citrucel, then belched to include the garlic and rosemary of the fish I ate for lunch.  That is  nasty .

 I woke well again today, and not on my stomach or sweating.  I had some more orange cranberry bread before and after my shower, and Ritz crackers while I was searching for new cars on the internet.  I'm having significant gas and gurgling now, a few minutes after eating the crackers, but it is completely in the "tolerable" range.

 I'm still up from last night (check the last post) its only 12:11 in the AM.  I just downed a quarter dose of Citrucel with a few big gulps of water afterwards.  Generally that isn't a good idea, and I'm not expecting this time to be any different.  I am still having some belching from yesterday (only a few hours ago, again see last post) and I suppose this will aggravate it. 
  Update:  Jeez, when its late at night and I'm sitting in front of the computer, seems like I'm posting every 15 minutes.  The truth is, I'm watching some anime on my pc so I tend to eat and then post at slow parts in the story.  I am a geek. 
 Watching Japanese cartoons is something that I've really come to enjoy since I've been sick.  It's a great distraction to keep my mind off of being ill, for as long as I want or as long as I have episodes to watch. 
 But, getting to the point, I've been snacking on these Ritz crackers for a few minutes and I was able to let out a long belch.  I don't think the whole thing was just from the crackers, so it felt pretty good. 
  Update:  Well, its 1:20 am and the belching and bloating has dropped considerably. Those crackers made me damn thirsty though.  I don't think I'll have too much more water, however, because that always brings back the belching.  I think I'll have some more licorice tonight though, and maybe just a little water to wash that down while I read my book.

 Seems like I may reach my goal of waking earlier by making extreme progress in the opposite direction.  I was up until around 4 or 4:30 am last night, and slept in until 1:00 pm today.  I have to make a pact with my stomach not to eat after 7:00 pm or I will never be able to wake up early enough for my new job. 
 I did happen to wake up at around 8:00 am today because my stomach was is great pain.  It was the type of pain that I describe as coming "in waves" when I haven't eaten for a while, except there didn't seem to be any waves here.  I drank a large ammount of water in my semi-awake state hoping to calm the attack, but that created new problems.  The sharp pain went away, but there was a dull discomfort and perhaps a little nausea that was threatening to keep me awake.  When I'm half awake like that, my symptoms often seem worse than they realy are, so here is a  grain of salt to go with my report. 
 When I finaly rose from bed at 1:00 pm I ate some sweedish fish candy that were next to my bed, simply because they were there and I had an awful taste in my mouth.  My throat seems better today, but I'm not looking forward to more belching.  This is going to be one of those days that I don't want to eat anything. 
  Update:  I had half a piece of Orange Cranberry Bread.  My abdomen is mildly cramping in waves. 
  Update:  The original intestinal cramping mentioned above has been replaced by the "waves of pain" in my stomach. 
  Update:  Everything is settled, but still unsettled.  This is one of the more aggrivating parts of keeping track of my symptoms; when I cant describe what is going on.  My stomach muscles are clenched, but it may just be from habbit.  As I write this I'm concentrating on relaxing my body and feeling what is really going on.  I have gurgling in my lower intestines, and earlier there was some issue with my stomach but it was general - just an ill feeling.  I haven't eaten much today. I don't really want to.

 The bloating and belching really seems to have lessened now (12:40 am).  I brushed my teeth and perhaps coincidently that seems to have helped with the burning in my throat.  At least the taste of  urlLink Crest 's new  urlLink Herbal Mint  toothpaste is a hell of a lot better than what I was dealing with.  That was good marketing too, they sent me a sample in the mail and I liked it, so I bought a tube. 
 My intestines are continuing to slowly cramp up, but its very mild. 
  Update:  I've just  have  to push my luck.  It's 2:00 am, everything was settled down, and I decide to eat some  urlLink Honey Maid graham sticks .  They're new, like graham crackers that have already been broken into the little sticks.  They're ok, but not quite exactly the same consistency of regular graham crackers.  The crackers make me thirsty so I drink some water and the whole belching and bloating thing starts all over again.  Of course, the belching brings more acid up into my throat, which has begun to burn again.  South Beach Diet my ass, get yourself what I've got and you'll be thin in no time.

       Major electric pain in intestines after changing position on chair, only lasted one second. 
    
     
 
 
 I didn't eat anything all day, so I was able to train tonight.  After training I had half a Subway wrap.  About an hour after that I changed my position in my chair, bringing my feet up onto the chair and my knees close to my chest, and I had an extreme pain in my abdomen just below belly button level on my right side.  It felt like electricity being jolted through my intestines, but only for a second (I've been electrocuted before, I know what it feels like).  Then it was gone.  With the feeling came overwhelming nausea but it left with the pain.  I did not vomit.  The pain has not come back. 
 I just now thought about my apendix.  If my appendix had ruptured I would expect a great deal of pain to continue afterwards, and none has.  Perhaps its my imagination, but I feel a light gurgling in my abdomen and it seems to be concentrated in the area of the earlier pain.  That worries me. 
 I had the other half of the Subway wrap at midnight.

 I'm posting a little late this morning...uhm...afternoon.  I woke at around 8 as usual with pain in my stomach.  I drank some water and went back to sleep, rising eventually at 11:30.  I had a package of swiss cake rolls when I woke up simply because I had a craving. Minor belching followed.  Just now at 1:40 pm I had half a cup of Silk Cultured Soy (Soy based yogurt).  Again, minor belching.  I'm trying to eat little so I can train tonight.

 The shower drain is not draining so I'm forced to wash up in the sink.  Not having a shower makes me cranky. 
 I had a half banana with peanut butter at 11:00 am, the other half at around noon. 
 I don't think my intestines liked the peanut butter.  I'm having gurgling, cramping and a little nausea. 
  Update:  The dull pain in my intestines has not left me all day.  It really steals my appetite.  I've had a little food today, but not nearly enough.  I'll likely eat more this evening and be up late, sick in bed. 
  Update:  I'm sitting down to a frozen chicken dinner.  I'm eating very slowly, but I'm sure I'll still be sick.  My intestines are  still  cramping.

 The light gurgling is gone, but I'm having waves of pain in my stomach for about an hour now.  From 2:00 am to almost 3.

 I've been getting a little lax with this blog.  Today and yesterday my computer has been off, so I haven't been able to simply walk up to it and enter a post. 
 I'm not even sure what food I've eaten so far today.  I'm tired, and my body is still very sore from training on Wednesday. I need more protein and more water.

       Belching, sour stomach 
    
     
 
 
 I had a half bologna sandwich with mayonnaise for the first time in a long time.  The results were disastrous.  I'm belching a lot and bringing up a lot of acid.  My throat is burning.  My intestines are gurgling badly and I'm a bit nauseous. 
  Update:  I can't even begin to understand what is going on with my stomach.  There just doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it anymore.  The only constant is that if I eat or drink, I feel sick.  It's 11:37 pm now and I'm finally feeling a bit better. The odd feeling in my stomach has settled.  I wish I could explain it better, but I suppose it felt as if I had eaten 20 cold raw eggs.  My stomach felt like it was full of cold fluid that was making me nauseous.  There wasn't enough belching to make me feel better, but the belching I did have made me feel even worse.  I can't wait to find the doctor that knows what this is. 
 It may be a bit suprising but I almost feel like eating again.  I don't get hungry anymore, but I do have a constant urge to eat something.  My stomach doesn't want it but my brain knows better, I guess.

 I was once told by a Taoist monk that to protect one's eyes from strain, it is helpful to look at green.  I'm thinking that this blog is not what he was talking about. 
 I haven't been posting in this blog often enough over the past two days, because for the first week in a long time, I haven't been sitting in front of my computer all day.  That isn't to say that I've been feeling better, I just have things to do.  Today I need to do a little shopping, but right now I'm waiting for my breakfast to settle. 
 This morning I had a whole cup of soy yogurt, and a few jelly beans.  The jelly beans were left over from watching a movie last night and I wanted to get rid of them so I would stop eating them.  I know, it's flawed logic.  The soy yogurt was peach and so far my least favorite flavor.  My stomach is clenched right now and I'm swallowing often because I cant get the feeling of food to leave my throat. The ever-present belching is, of course, ever-present and I could swear that I feel my intestines backing things up every so often; it makes me a little nauseous.  I was planning to leave in 15 minutes, but I think I'll wait a bit longer for my breakfast to settle. 
 Before I left my bed today, I had a bout with stomach pain that I tried to remedy by drinking a little water. Today my body is still sore from the exercise I did on Wednesday.  That isn't normal.  I could understand being sore for 3 days if I had really worked myself hard, but I hadn't.  My nutrition is definitely poor.

 There just hasn't been a safe thing to eat these last few days.  Seems like no matter what, I get sick.  Today was better though, but I didn't eat enough.  I have a list of the things I ate today, and it looks long but the ammounts are very small.  I didn't, however, suffer any extreme ill affects today.  I had a few rough moments, but not too bad.  The worst was probably around 10:00 when my stomach was very empty except for water.  That odd hollow feeling was very unsettling. 
 Tomorrow I start my first day at my new job.  This is going to be a challenge.

 Today was my first day of work.  The nerves were running hot most of the morining and I was afraid to eat the rest of the day.  I got home at close to 6:00 and I feel like making up for lost time in the food department, so I'm staying home to eat tonight. 
  Update:  Seems like I've been packing it away tonight!  I've had what feels like a lot of food, but its only little bits of food in a variety.  Everything was going well until I had the last of the Rotini, about 20 noodles, with heavy salt.  They didn't go down too well and I had a hard time belching afterwards.  Now I have heart burn.  Is it the salt?  I do feel full though.  Not the sick, bloated kind of full but the more satisfying kind.  It is already 10:00 at night and I know I won't be laying down to bed anytime soon with this heartburn and full belly.  Damn.  I've  got  to eat durring the day! 
 So after the food tonight, the belching continues with a little bloating and nausea topped off with heartburn.  If I were in this condition at work, I would definately be hiding in the bathroom.  Maybe I can take my laptop into the stall with me!  I'm not expecting to feel better until around midnight, which means I wont sleep until at least 2 am again.  Well, it was almost a plan. 
  Update:  My guts just made something like a cramping - convulsing feeling and I got real nauseous.  That sucked.  I still cant get the feeling of acid out of the back of my throat and that is also making me feel sick, along with the bloating.  My mouth says "eat something to get rid of this acid" but my stomach says "don't you dare send anything else down here, or I'll send it back!"  I'm not getting to sleep until well after 2:00 am.

 My second day at the new job.  I ate more than yesterday, but still not enough.  I'm trying to make up for it at home each night though.  It's difficult. 
 I'm not going to go into detail with the descriptions today, but the hidden xml in this post has all the information.  I try to post only the necessary data while at work.  I may be forced to forego this blog in favor of a more concice format...which means a lot of coding on my own site. 
 Ah well.  That is what I chose to do with my life.

 I had some Peanut M&ampM's for my sweet tooth at around 2:00pm. The results were facinating.  I could feel my stomach tightening down a little bit more with each piece of candy. 
 Heres something I didn't consider...M&amp;M's contain Lactose. 
  Update:  I ate a great deal when I came home.  It went ok, meaning I was at about a 3 of 10 for discomfort.  One my symptoms settled I decided to have a very small bite of a rice crispy treat and that went terribly.  My esophogus is burning and my stomach is tight again.  Maybe because the treat was hard and scratched my throat?

 I must have woken hungry today.  I had a whole banana and half my lunch sandwich by 9:00 am. 
 "I gotta say it was a good day." Today was great! I ate a lot without hardly any trouble.  I even trained tonight.  I was a little dizzy at class, and my body just can't do what it used to. Still, it was worth it.
