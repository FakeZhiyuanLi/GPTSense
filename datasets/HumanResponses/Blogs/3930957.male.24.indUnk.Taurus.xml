      Intellectual prowess is really a combination of three things: an insatiable curiosity to know things, a passion for&nbsp;the challenge of that curiosity, and a zealous ambition to pursue one's passions.&nbsp; Most people are innately curious. Fewer are passionate about that curiosity. Fewer still are ambitious enough to pursue their passions. Ambition takes courage--it pushes us to our upper limits, to the boundaries of our capabilities. In fact, even being passionate takes courage. It is what we are passionate about that makes us or breaks us. The same passions which can make us great can also destroy us.    The passion for philosophy will either make you a peaceful man or drive you to the limits of insanity.    Robert M. Pirsig wrote this about the&nbsp;philosopher Phaedrus:   "He was insane. And when you look directly at an insane man all you see is a reflection of your own knowledge that he's insane, which is not to see him at all. To see him you must see what he saw and when you are trying to see the vision of an insane man, an oblique route is the only way to come at it. Otherwise your own opinion can block the way. There is only one access to him that I can see as passable and we still have a way to go."  I am not Phaedrus, but we are not so dissimilar.&nbsp;I feel insane through and through--not in the&nbsp;talking-to-yourself-on-the-bus kind of way, mind you, but in the contrary-to-the-status-quo kind of way. You see, sanity is no objective standard. It is, in fact, merely a recognized normal mode of thinking or perspective. Why should we fear insanity? Chances are, we were never sane to begin with. We learn sanity in order to get by. We crush our curiosity, dispel our passions, and redirect our ambitions in the name of social harmony, in the name of fitting in.   I met a stripper yesterday while waiting for the bus. I didn't notice at first, but in the course of small talk I asked her what she did. This is my favorite question to ask people. I have determined there are two types of people in the world. Type one will answer the question about what they do by telling you what job they perform or where they work. Type two will tell you what passions they pursue, whether it be a hobby or money generating activity. Type one defines themselves by how they create the money which allows them to meet their needs, and God willing, their wants. Type two defines themselves by their passions. It is the type two person that makes the world go around. It is the type two person that has embraced being human and all the associated rational and emotional perks.    Type one is no more complex than a bird, just building a nest and lining it with shiny things.    This stripper told me to guess what she did--and that she wouldn't be offended by the answer. One glance at her outrageous makeup, an intuition about her character, and the knowledge that she was taking the bus to the court house held all the answers I needed. I did not guess, however, because despite her occupation, she could still be a type two person. So I explained that I couldn't guess because I didn't know what type of person she was, and then I explained the different types of people. Even with the subterfuge explained, she answered that she was an 'entertainer'.    Just a bird. A dancing bird.    So I then asked her what her passions were. She said: "Hanging out with her friends, eating, and outdoor sports." That's actually a decent list. I know much smarter, more intellectual people who might have difficulty naming three of their passions. Albeit, those smarter, more intellectual people are likely to have, in fact more passions and nearly all of them more sophisticated, there is something to be said for being able to rattle them off when asked. It's good to be aware of what you love.    Oh, and eating is probably in my top three, too.

      I have wondered about the term 'revolution' before. Does it come from 'revolt' or from 'revolve'? There is an important difference. When we make changes in our lives, we effect a revolution; one that is internal and often fraught with danger and derring-do. To&nbsp;revolt is to "rise in rebellion against constituted authority; renounce allegiance; mutiny; rebel". This is what we want when we try to change. But we don't revolt, we revolve.   To revolve is to "move in an orbit around a center;&nbsp;move in cycles; recur periodically". And thus, a complete revolution, is a change that has come around full circle to the place it began, occurring and recurring as it has always and will always do.    Everything comes full circle.    And so we change, we head off in some direction, and yet we are held fast in orbit around some immovable center. Change your path or change your direction: It doesn't matter because the change wont be complete until you have come completely around and not changed at all. If you want to change, the only way to do it is to shift the center around which you orbit. This is your core, and if you change this, then all of your actions and ideas and directions in life will follow suit. This is incredibly difficult.   I quit smoking cigarettes four years ago. It was easy, actually. This past week I have smoked at least a whole pack. Why? Because I was caught in revolution. I had changed much since I was a smoker, but here, in this week, I had come fully around and found myself wanting cigarettes. I was seeking something else other cigarettes, something far more mercurial and vague, yet my desire for a cigarette was nonetheless real.    Four years equaled one full revolution.    I doubt I'll ever smoke cigarettes again.&nbsp;I wonder, now, in what direction I should head. If I must repeat my mistakes, as we all will, as we all do, then ought I not intend to make the most pleasant mistakes possible, so that in their repetition I can find some happiness? Would I not be insane to do otherwise?     A foot and light hearted I take to the open road,  Healthy, free, the world before me,  The long brown path before me leading wherever&nbsp;I choose.   Henceforth I do not ask good-fortune, I am myself good-fortune,  Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,  Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,  Strong and content I travel the open road.   The earth, that is sufficient,  I do not want the constellations any nearer,  I know they are well where they are,  I know they suffice for those who belong to them.   (Still here I carry my delicious burdens,  I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go,  I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,  I am fill'd with them, and I will fill them in return.)

      DISCLAIMER: This passion runs deep and this post is long. If you have not the patience nor interest, please just consider this question: "How ought we act?"  &nbsp;  My passion as a philosopher is ethics, and I'm discovering that the process of becoming an&nbsp;ethicist is a curious one. I think that we are all born with some innate code of ethics that helps us be morally good people before we have the ability to rationalize things. How would I love to tap into that innate code again! Instead, I am running in logical circles trying to rationalize and systematize ethics. You see, little kids don't require proof of their ethical codes, and for all their 'irresponsibility', guilt comes easily to them. This is not to say that they admit their guilt. They just don't rationalize it away. There are millions of people in this world who have absolved themselves of guilt for who they are by simply not taking responsibility for their lives. But this post is not about responsibility; not yet, at least. This is about the struggle of the ethicist.  &nbsp;  Ethics is a complicated field. We ethicists are to blame. We have so confused the simple ideas of good and bad and right and wrong that grown men, well educated and intelligent, can't seem to make sense of how people ought to interact. And that is, I think, what we are trying to do when we discuss ethics. We are trying to determine how people ought to interact.  &nbsp;   What could be easier than understanding how two people ought to treat each other?   &nbsp;  There are some problems. We have two words: morals and ethics. Is there a difference between these words? Maybe the dictionary and I would disagree, but I think that they are two very different things. What I intend to do here is briefly sketch my moral theory, not in any philosophically rigorous way, but in a way that taps into intuitive natures and raises questions we should all have about ethics. First, there are two equivocations. Moral and ethical are not interchangeable terms, and what is good and what is right are not always the same thing.  &nbsp;  I take 'moral' to be a description of goodness, not a description of rightness. 'Ethical' is the description of rightness. I must step back and express a platitude: people are only responsible for things within their control, such as their intentions and their actions. We are responsible for the consequences to our actions only in so far as they can be related to our actions and intentions. What this mean changes on a case-by-case basis, so that someone might be wholly responsible for the consequences of an action, while a second in similar circumstances might be wholly absolved. What is fully and unquestionably in the realm of human control (and not necessarily success) is the aforementioned intentions and actions. It is these things alone that we should consider when thinking of ethical theory. It is only in the application of ethical theory that consequences and antecedent conditions matter.  &nbsp;  To the philosophically knowledgeable:  &nbsp;   &nbsp;Yes, I am indeed dismissing all consequentialist moral theories and, moreover,&nbsp;without sufficient defense.   &nbsp;  If this irks you, just leave a comment and I will satisfactorily discharge your doubts.  &nbsp;  To the philosophically unknowledgeable:  &nbsp;   My word is gospel.   &nbsp;  I'm kidding. Read on.  &nbsp;  Each action, has a motive, an intention, yet each intention does not necessarily become an action. Actions get their 'rightness' from their success. They get their 'goodness' from their formative intentions. We can witness actions, but we can only guess at intentions. Only the agent knows their own intentions. This leaves us in a pickle. How do we ever know if someone else is acting morally. Quite simply, we don't. Yet, that doesn't mean we can't make exceptionally good guesses. Not being certain of a person's motives should not hinder us very much.  &nbsp;  What this means, at this point, is that I'd like to understand ethics as a system of action and morals as a system of intentions. But I'll talk about that later, when I write Ethics 2: The 'Big Fuss'.

      I'm not sure how much of my life I&nbsp;spend lost in fictions--my own fictions and other's. I read heavily and when I am not reading I am writing in my journals or on this web log or working on my book. At times I feel that my life could be reducible to exercises in the written word. My epigraph could read: He read and wrote. But what passions I feel when I read! What passions I express when I write! I am in this holy commune with the English language. I tend to regard all life as a fiction and thus, regard the best stories as those which take advantage of truth. Fiction needs only mirror life to be exceptional. I am a realist.  &nbsp;  Yet, it is sometimes hard to write truth. Life is unpredictable and emotionally charged. A mere retelling of events does not allow for the re-creation of life. It is the re-feeling of emotions that achieves this feat. As a writer, and a novice at that, I find it challenging to access the emotions of my characters and not just their thoughts or actions. This is to be expected, I imagine. Much of my difficulty comes from the fact that, I, like many people, drift through life blissfully unaware of the emotions of people around me and maybe even my own. As I have struggled with my characters, I have sought to understand them by seeking to understand the people in my life. Suddenly, I have become aware of the emotional world.  &nbsp;   How refreshing!   &nbsp;  Today, I received a letter from one of my very best friends. He has recently had to deal with the serious illness of his father and there were times when his father's survival was in question. The frame of my book, its foundation, is a hospital-set father-and-son reconciliation. I asked if he wouldn't mind helping me bring life to my story by sharing with me some of the things that he felt during this crisis, and maybe at the same time it would help him to get some of his thoughts and feelings out about all that had happened. What I received was a four-page letter that moved me more than Dostoevsky or Hemingway ever has. This wonderful friend of mine, who usually guards his emotional expressiveness, gave me a direct, open, emotional tour-de-force. It was real, raw, and written one time, straight through, without any editing or revising.  &nbsp;  This is the power of confession, the power of truth. I will spend several years on this book trying to create what poured from the heart of my friend in four pages. I will spend several years trying to make life of fiction. I was wrong. Fiction needs to do more than  mirror  life to be exceptional; fiction must  live  to be exceptional.

      I have read selections from a book entitled  Anti-Americanism  by Jean-Francois Revel.&nbsp;His book takes a look a anti-Americanism in France and the French perceptions of American culture. His stance is that cultural contact is a positive influence; that French anti-Americanism is a mindless, child-like fear.  &nbsp;  I am pondering, now, anti-Americanism around the world and the motivations behind it. The French are afraid of their diminished global influence, especially in spheres they once dominated such as art, literature, film and philosophy. At one point, the ability to speak the French language was almost a prerequisite of 'cultured' learning. Yet now, in this modern age of global information and multinational business, the English language has become the tool of trade. Nations in the Anglosphere, along with burgers and clothing and cars, are trading around the world art and literature and film. This allows for the widespread recognition of talent which always walks in hand with the recognition of genius.  &nbsp;  What confuses me, though, is that often American culture is less of a singular entity and more of a vehicle for other cultures; a place where cultures meet and merge. My passions include Russian literature, Italian art, German philosophy, Austrian music. The only thing  distinctly  American that I think I am passionate about is American politics. But I feel inspired. I intend to write regularly on things that I think are, in fact, distinctly American.  &nbsp;   I very much recommend Revel's  Anti-Americanism .

       I am listening to Pearl Jam right now--as I write this and possibly as you read this.&nbsp; I'm wondering to what extent pop culture is able to educate. Eddie would probably try to convince me that he&nbsp;educates in  all  his songs; that music is a powerful tool for this purpose. Perhaps, but there is an old cliche about tools and weapons that begins: "In the right hands..." Is music a tool, and is it in the right hands? Plato thought that music, more than the other arts, needed to be censored because of its ability to stir men's souls. Was he right? Could Plato make his case against the values portrayed in the modern&nbsp;music genres? I suppose so.     And maybe for my part, I am just as swayed by music as every other person is.&nbsp;While I think that Plato would like the music I listen to, I think he would definitely censor this one:      "Present Tense"

      Your clarification, dear Count,&nbsp;makes much more sense. I, too, hold a probabilistic view of the universe, although mine accommodates human decision--a term which avoids the baggage accompanying 'free will'--and in doing so salvages morality, which is always the first victim of deterministic metaphysics. Despite this, I still must question the notion of necessity implicit in determinism. Also, the very concept of probability is loaded with modal implications. When something is considered to be probable, it is recognized at hypothetical. Merely stipulating that all logically possible universes are probable, and then asserting that all probable universes do exist, while maintaining that the human experience is limited to the navigation of a single&nbsp;causally-closed series of events raises countless questions. First and foremost, should be the question of why the system never errors; why humans never experience simultaneous realities. Second, I would like to know the  reasons why  a&nbsp;certain probable event&nbsp;has occurred over another, since probability of actuality does not guarantee actuality.  &nbsp;  In the midst of this, there is a deep and serious criticism of the notion of probability qua probability. A materialist might deny the very existence of probabilities as anything other than fictions--albeit fictions with a high degree of useful, speculative power. After an event (and during and before, for that matter), there must be, for each effect of the event, a single and necessary cause; so the materialist position stands. Probabilities are used to speculate about the future based on known causes, while taking into account unknown causes and unforeseen interference.&nbsp; The materialist would claim that since the beginning of time, since the original 'uncaused cause' [read: an atheist's account of the immovable mover],&nbsp;&nbsp;all of existence has been a series of necessary causes and effects. Our sciences and&nbsp;recognize this as unquestionable. Should you believe this is not the case; should you believe in a probabilistic universe and, moreover, believe that these probabilities are not merely speculative but carry metaphysical significance, then I think you must assert that some things are able to operate outside of necessity. I think, indeed, that you do believe this. this is the germ of 'free will'. Should a conscious being discover the power to operate outside of necessity, this being will encounter a decision procedure, which will be the cause of action and not the deterministic order to the universe.  &nbsp;   I must believe in the possibility of a human decision-making procedure free from determinism; else, I am&nbsp;responsible for nothing.   &nbsp;  [In a comment to Response to my dear count]  urlLink  AlexanderVronsky    said...   Well, I should perhaps clarify, it's not determinism in the traditional sense. I don't know that there has already been coined a name for this concept, this is my own view, so perhaps I should clarify a bit more to my definition. The only reason why I consider it to be determinism is that given the current physical state of all identical universes, x event will in fact occur, though not necessarily in this universe. And it's not really random, it only appears such from our perspective, it's actually probabilistic (As in if there is a 1:2 chance of each of 3 outcomes, in one third of each infinity of identical universes each of those events will happen). I would argue that it only appears that we have free will, when we appear to make a decision, in a infinitude of other universes, we acted differently. Since we can't, by definition, know about the actions in a different universe, it appears as though we made one discrete choice, when it actually occurs that we made all the choices in all the universes, that were previously identical, in parts, according to the probability of the various decisions that can be made. As for Augustine, Augustine was working from a flawed theological basis, and isn't really relevant, as it makes the presumption of a god existing as described in the bible, whom I consider to contain paradoxical components. This idea isn't espoused by any physicists of which I know, this is purely my own interpretation of what I've read and considered. But the deeper we delve into the nature of the universe, the more it appears to be random. I hope this clarifies my argument a bit for you, and I suppose I could be wrong as well.

         "There is, indeed, nothing more vexing than to be, for example, rich, of good family, of decent appearance, fairly well educated, not stupid, rather good-hearted even, and at the same time to possess no talent, no special quality, no eccentricity even, not a single idea of one's own, to be precisely "like everyone else." One is rich , but not so rich as Rothschild; of a good family, but one which has never distinguished itself in any way; of decent appearance, but an appearance expressive of very little; well educated, but without knowing what to do with that education; one is intelligent, but without one's own ideas; one is good-hearted, but without greatness of soul, and so on and so forth. There are a great number of such people in the world, far more than it appears. Like all people, they may be divided into two categories: some are mentally limited, others "much cleverer." The first are happier. For the "ordinary" person of limited intelligence nothing is easier than to imagine himself an exceptional and original person and to take delight in this delusion with no misgivings. It has been enough for some of our young ladies to cut their hair short, put on blue eyeglasses, and call themselves Nihilists for them to persuade themselves that, in putting on their spectacles, they immediately acquired "convictions" of their own. It is enough for a man to feel in his heart a droplet of humanitarian and benevolent emotion to be immediately persuaded that no one feels so deeply as he and that he stands at the very vanguard of civilization. It is enough for another to pick up some thought he has heard, or to read a page at random somewhere, to believe at once that it was "his own idea," engendered in his own brain. Naive arrogance--if one may so express it--reaches extraordinary proportions in such cases; it is all quite unbelievable, yet very frequently met with."  --Fyodor Dostoevsky,  The Idiot , 1868  &nbsp;   Cast off the dead skin.

       What is the point in stipulating that the universe is determined in a non-predictable fashion. The point--in philosophy and not quantum mechanics--of determinism is to deny free will. This occurs from two positions. The theist claims divine order and the materialist cites the causal closure of the physical realm. Both include an idea of necessity. It is this necessity which counters free will, for we are not free to act if the actions we take are necessary actions. Yet a random determinism theory seems to allow for determined actions without necessity. This runs a close parallel to Augustinian compatibilist arguments which try to reconcile free will with divine omnipotence. The main line of his argument is to stipulate, in a sense, that God can know the determination of the universe without an implicit condition of necessity. I don't buy it. If there is a determination to the universe, it cannot be random, or unnecessary. The entire idea simply sounds like some physicists trying to reconcile a belief in randomly caused events with their materialist metaphysics.    I could be wrong.    [In a comment to Theme: 'to be, or not to be']  AlexanderVronsky said ...  You know I don't believe life is a series of choices, what I call random determinism is more likely I think, though. I suppose that'd kinda' make philosophy useless. :) But anyhow, I find it likely that all possibilities do in fact occur, as well as every thought process just not in this universe. The appearance of free will and decision making is just an illusion, because we're only cognizant of one universe. This is supported by decoherence, and black holes present no counterarguments with AdS/CFT correspondence.

      What to do about Palestine? This is a question running through my mind. I was speaking of it earlier on very little sleep with a friend of mine who had gotten none. Those conversations are always a struggle. His interest in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is personal, whereas mine is not, and it may be for this very reason that I brought up the subject.  How does a state avoid destruction at the hands of neighbors hell-bent on this pursuit? What kind of success will a two-state system effect? Should Palestinians have a right of return?  I'm not enough of a pragmatist to answer these questions in any real way.  But if I was, I think I might be forced to say something like this: Hey Palestinians, you get your own state and the right to return. We'll pull up the settlements, set the borders to the 1967 lines, and live happily ever after. But, if one single nut-job in the bunch of you tries to blow something up, we will pursue you with a genocidal rage that will last until the face of the Earth has been wiped clean of all memory of your people.   Come on now. Settle down. I'm not serious.   I'm only trying to make a point. Any solution is likely to be ephemeral, any peace tenuous. I heard that in the Air Force, a mid-air collision was once called 'two aircraft trying to occupy the same space at the same time'. This can't happen, obviously, and results in one aircraft crashing into the other with one, or both, facing destruction. Now, suppose that the aircraft are nations of people and the space they are trying to occupy is Israel. Forced with three options--destruction of self, destruction of the other, and mutual destruction--what would you pursue? The answer is fairly obvious, Khrushchev. The only solution to avoid destruction is to avoid collision. Is there a path to avoid collision? I want to believe that the two-state solution is just such a path. Yet, my previously mentioned sagacious friend seems to think that the two-state solution, in fact, the very two-state demand, is just rhetoric, and not likely to solve the real problem of Palestinian anti-Semitism. (My apologies, Friend, if I have abused your position.)  There is this idea of ancient hate--the inevitability of ethnic conflict. Situations such as Bosnia and Rwanda are just examples of the resurfacing of old wars and conflicts. But I do not buy into this theory. There is history, but no collective memory. People find new reasons to hate. They find new reasons to wage old wars. Palestinian children hate Israel because their parents hate Israel. By the time they grow up, they will have found their own personal reasons for hating Israel which they will pass onto their children, like some kind of birthright. But suppose all the children believe that the hate is about statehood. Suppose that is the reason they choose to hate Israel after their pre-pubescent indoctrination. Then, the two-state solution becomes a solution in fact. There is some sort of manipulation here. If you can make someone who hates you, feel that way for a reason that you can fix, then you can fix the reason and assuage the hate. So, as the two-state theory gets bandied about more and more, it's likely to become more and more a viable solution to the problem.   Machiavelli stirs.

      I know some  Literateurs  who find Shakespeare too common for their tastes. What they seek in literature is the unknown or the esoteric. They would rather talk to you about books and authors you have never heard of. Do not be fooled by these people. They are not lovers of literature, but sad people in search of a status symbol.  'To be, or not to be,' that  is  the question. Life is a series of choices, each leading us to a new state of being. Should we just  be , or should we choose to  not be , to become, to restlessly pursue  being . And do it all in this life, not the next, whatever that may be. I like to think not of reincarnation, but rehabilitation. Should I prepare for the afterlife or tomorrow? Could they be the same thing? It seems as though we are all suffering addicts. We are addicted to the memories of our past--those glorified, idealized moments where we embrace a definition of self based on illusion, on fabrication. We are all fictional entities, perpetuating a lie we have been working on since birth.    Step One: Admit you have a problem.   Knowing is half the battle, right? Well, consider this. You have had only one perspective of events since birth. From these events, you have come to understand yourself. Your nature is thus based on the subjective reality you have chosen to believe is the actual past. You, who you are, is a subjective interpretation of yourself, one created and maintained willfully. This is what must people call an 'identity'. 'To be', that is, to be yourself, is just the maintenance of this identity. This takes regular reaffirmation of you belief in that identity by the repetition of behavior. This repetition of behavior includes both our success and failures. Thus, it is for the sake of having an identity that we knowingly repeat our mistakes.  I think that is certifiably insane.  If you destroy the memories of your past--seek to believe in them from other perspectives or to disbelieve your own perspective as definitive--your identity slowly slips away. Without this troubling identity, we are able to make new decisions, become new people. Each day, each moment, on the threshold of each decision, we now find absolute freedom. But the sacrifice of identity does not happen easily. After all, we are addicts. Often in life, we are able to sacrifice our identities, but immediately afterwards, with our new found freedom and perspective on life, we begin to create and maintain a new identity. We go through this process every so often until we lack the energy or will power to see it through another round.  A wise fellow once said, "All achievement is transient, strive unremittingly."

      To start talking, you need only one single idea to communicate. Then, while you try to explain yourself, a million other ideas creep in: foundational, tangential, epiphenomenal--such as all ideas might be. You connect these notions, synthesize them, systematize them and then try to elucidate the complex mechanics of your machine, hoping the whole time that the person listening to you is still paying attention. A vain hope, this is, I assure you. Yet, nonetheless, you stride boldy to your conclusion, proudly defiant of simplicity, and deliver your revolution qua conclusion. You wait expectantly while your listener absorbs your wisdom. Response: Yeah, I liked the book, too. Pause, then nothing. Long moments of nothing stretching into eons and eternities of nothing.   It is not without rashness that I think myself capable of communicating with human beings.   Did I waste my time or theirs? This is why I write.  I have met some people that can converse, but most of the time I am hopelessly engaged in small-talk. Small-talk is loneliness incarnate. Its loneliness that drives people together only to talk about nothing. They think that the cure for loneliness is to no longer be alone. This is just loneliness in groups. We are lonely until we connect with another human being. And so I find myself, not alone, but face-to-face with people, interacting, and overwhelmingly lonely.  I seek out these situations like a moth seeks a flame. Every so often, we manage to break out of the small-talk into big-talk. Each time it feels like a confessional. The sharing of ideas and passions  is  a spiritual event. The connection is made, a bond formed, and the communication commences. Rare, yet worth it every time. It's pull is powerful enough to drive me from my books and journals and notebooks into the human world. For this, I live.    I am the non-committal cynic. I am the pensive optimist.   This is post one on this blog, entitled "Quixotic Passions". Since you are reading this, you know this. This is not an announcement. Rather, it is declaration. Our passions make us crazy. They drive us to things that nothing else could. They give purpose to our being, structure to our lives, answers to our questions. Our passions give us energy and charisma, as we struggle to embrace them. My passions are many, and they pull me in many directions. I let them. I let them rip me in opposite directions, fight over me, consume me. To me, this is life. But I must vacation from le Mancha. This is why my nom de plume is Ivan, and not Dmitri. Here, I am the quiet center of the universe, detached and observant. This is my vacation.

      Are you a man or are you a god? A mortal being, or one timeless and boundless? This is no slight question, nor is it simply the rambling of a confused thinker. We exist in our own self-defined worlds as self-defined people. We are products of our environment and the only true elements of self we can find within ourselves is the desire to conform or non-conform. We are presented with a thousand ways to live a life, all of them tried. Some of these ways are good and some of these ways are bad. And then we choose one or several and we spend the rest of our lives trying to press ourselves into the molds we have chosen. We create our bounds, we are not born with them. We have limitations imposed upon our bodies by nature, but none on our minds and our imagination. This is how a creature that cannot fly on its own power flew to the moon. Do not accept your natural limitations as a boundary of your power.  And what of death? Are we not limited in time? Was not Buddha limited in time? Was not Jesus limited in time? And their words echo through the ages of man more immortal than the men that lived beyond them. The words of Jesus are more immortal than you. While you have lived and died the thoughts of one man have survived. Is death, then, a limitation? If you are nothing more than an animal that eats, breathes, reproduces and sleeps, then death will face you certainly and finally. Beyond death lie the people unbounded by death. For them, death is the end of the functioning of the body, but their minds and their ideas rest incessantly in the minds of the living--the eternal god.  It can be confusing to think of what this means. If you have 80 years; if you have 29,220 days; if you have 701,280 hours to live, for your body to function, then what are you doing? You have lost how much of that; a quarter of it; a third; a half?  Stop whatever you're doing and throw out your self-definition. Do you procrastinate, lie, cheat? Just stop. Wake up tomorrow and just stop. But tomorrow, you'll have one less day than today. Wake up today. Snap out of the identity you have created, which find so much peace and comfort in. You do not have to be today the person you were yesterday, and if you are, then you are by choice. Shake up your world and then shake up the world of those around you. They have already lied down to die, yet they are the living. They have given up. Do you work hard, micro-manage your life, are you rich? To what end? What are you working for? Do you know who you are? People will work so hard on things that are so monumentally unimportant because it's easier than asking themselves difficult questions and finding even more difficult answers.   The you that can be described is not the eternal you. The you that can be spoken is not the eternal you.   How much of your life have you wasted intellectualizing yourself, making excuses for your discomfort, pretending you had exactly what you wanted, and fearing those things that could destroy your routine. Your fears make you weak. Your pretense makes you arrogant. Your lies make you suffer. And your rational understanding of yourself will destroy you.  I want to make money and I want to make love. I want to paint and write and read. I want to be rich and poor. I want to get into and out of trouble. I want to be addicted and free. I want to hurt and heal. I want to see. I want to know and I want to feel. I want to cry and laugh. I want to meet people and remember them. I want to know people and forget them.  But I swear, I won't rationalize myself. I won't pretend that I have or don't have what I want. I wont make excuses--I don't need to because I am here with eyes open. And I swear, more than all the other oaths I have taken, I won't be afraid.   I am boundless and timeless, an entity undefined and free, and now unafraid.     I am forever alive.
