       &nbsp; I found out today that I passed all of the tests and background checks for the new casino job I'm starting. I was scared for a minute. I'll admit I used to dabble in mary jane in the first two years of college and have been an occasional smoker ever since. The horror stories that you'll hear about hair testing is crazy. Before taking the test, I got everything from "you'll pass with flying colors" to "the test goes back six years and you'll fail miserably."  &nbsp; Well, being a fan of the internet, I did a little research on how to beat a hair test. I found an at-home&nbsp;concoction that included vinegar, acne wash and liquid detergent. I used it. Twice. Then, the day of my test I had my long curly hair flat-ironed straight. The nurse at the testing center gave me that "I know what you're about" look right before she chopped off four different samples of hair from the back of my head.  &nbsp; While I sat there and prayed that I wouldn't be punished for the handful of times in my life I smoked, I felt that I was somehow going to pay a penance for it. The nurse put my samples away and told me I would hear about my results within 48 hours.  &nbsp; I took the test on a Thursday afternoon and to clear my head, I went out drinking with friends that night. Coming home at around three in the morning, I felt hopeless.&nbsp; I knew in my heart I would be stuck in retail until I one day sold a screenplay (i.e. retail forever). I went to sleep and prayed for sweet dreams.  &nbsp; The phone ringing at nine the next morning almost gave me a heartattack. The human resources representative on the other end of the phone telling me I got the job made my heart stop. I got the job. I, a slacker film student, actually got a real job. I still can't truly believe it.  &nbsp; I guess the moral of this story is, don't let obstacles hold you back. If you too would like to get out of retail hell and get a "real job" , don't be afraid to go for it and take the drug test. If all else feels hopeless, just soak your head in vinegar, acne wash with acylic (spelling?) acid and liquid detergent, you'll do fine. - Sabrina

       This is my first post and I'm excited that I was actually able to set up a blog at 4AM. This will be a short post, I'm headed to bed and will come back later to post some thoughts that have been running around in my mind lately. I've kept a diary, but this seems a more interesting way to keep track of my day-to-day adventures. :) - Sabrina
