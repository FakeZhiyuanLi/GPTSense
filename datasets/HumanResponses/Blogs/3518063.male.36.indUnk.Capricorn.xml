      I went in the downstairs bar to check on The Yuri.  "G.", seated at the bar, was the only customer in the room. The report of Ronald Reagans death was on the television. G. was breaking an old bar rule by talking about one of two things you should  never  talk about in a bar: politics (religion is the other). The Yuri was standing behind the bar,  listening, every once in a while making a non-committal sound like, "Mmmm", or," Hmff", or, "Snaff". I sidled up to listen.  G. said: " Sure it came at the expense of a trillion dollars of taxpayer money but Europe would not be enjoying the freedom it has today without Reagan's brilliance in bankrupting the Soviet Union by forcing them to keep up with our own military spending ."  Oh my freaking God.  While G. yapped on, The Yuri walked down to the far end of the bar and knelt down out of G.'s line of sight. Pretending to be looking for a bottle of something, he looked up at me, moving his fist near his mouth, poking his cheek out with his tongue.   Ah...The Yuri. The Great Sage. He nailed it once again.

      A noon phone call from K: "I want to go out tonight." "O.K." A quick check on-line and...shazzam!  urlLink Pedro the Lion  and  urlLink John Vanderslice  at The Bottom of the Hill. I took K. to see PTL during early courting so why not again.  At the show, Corona for me and a (strong) 'rita for K.   "At least you are not the oldest guy here tonight," she said, nodding toward J.V.s' keyboard/guitar/noise player. He was a small guy with a sailorâ€™s beard (short and thick, nothing on the upper lip), small glasses and a black watch cap. "No way. That guy can't be over 30." "Maybe. Well...what about that guy?" She pointed out a guy who was, yes, much older than I. He looked as if he had some previously bad days. Many, in a row. "Whatever", I said.  J.V. hit the stage. He looked just like a friend I had in grade school. We drifted apart in High School but our mothers were still close. I remember the phone call a few days before Christmas one year informing us that he had accidentally killed himself by injecting lighter fluid. He was sixteen. I hadn't thought of him in quite some time but was reminded of him when I saw J.V.s' bleach blonde hair and narrow face.  J.V. was quite good. Nice songs, good breaks.   K. forgot her earplugs so we stepped back to the bar to fetch some and watch the last of his set. (Another (strong) 'rita for K.)   I went back to the restroom and when I came out, the guy with the sailor beard was standing nearby talking to someone. He was a pretty small guy and, on closer inspection, I can comfortably say that he was much younger than I. I stood by for a second to see if K. would come up. I wanted us both to approach him and have him officially settle the bet by asking him to show us some I.D. but I noticed K. across the hall so the mystery remains.  PTL started off rough with a few missed notes here and there but, overall, still a nice tight band. After about five songs, singer/songwriter David Bazan asked the audience if there were any questions. He has done that at every show I have seen. It is usually pretty funny. The questions tonight ranged from, "What are you going to do after the tour", to, "What do you think of Kierkegaard?" But my favorite:   "Are you disappointed by the news of the breakup of 'Phish', and are you concerned that their fans may overtake your future shows?"  Bazan repeated the question slowly for the audience who collectively snickered. "Um...no, and...um...I am going to have to say...um...no".  Their set was good and the familiar songs were just that with the crowd politley cheering for them when the first bars of any of them were played. The new songs were fair but not great and the poor sound on Bazans vocals didn't help much but again the fans were pleased.  At one point during PTLs' set, K. turned to me and said, "This may sound like drunk talk but...I wish they were our friends, you know?"  Yes, I do know.  We were too tired to stay for the encore.

      This is a large painting that I finished right after college.    In Andy's words (via e-mail): "The shots pretty much tell all.  We were drunk and the painting was the topic."        I am sure Tequila was involved.  (Thanks Andy)
