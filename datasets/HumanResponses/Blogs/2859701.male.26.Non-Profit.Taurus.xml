      Let me apologize for misleading you.  The Lament of a Nation wasn't written by Hugh Grant but George Grant as a faithful reader noted. So with that lets begin to see what George might be saying to our context.    Grant's  lament  is framed along a line which is familiar to a lot of Canadians. How is it that Canadian society  can't be  purely "Canadian" but must instead be a  slightly different  brand of Am erican Culture . You can get this from most Canadians when you ask them what it means to be a Canadian. And since today is  Canada Day , it really becomes a  poignant  question. Most people you ask this question to might  rally  towards familiar symbols of Canadian cultural identity like say the  Beaver  or the  Mountie  but at the end of the day the refrain which comes again and again is that  we are not American . Identity is something which at the very basic level is something which distinguishes something or someone from something else... ie makes us distinct from something else. But once you move on from the fact that something is different you need reasons to substantiate the distinction.  Canadians  by and large stop at the " we're just different ".  At the  heart  of this problem Grant contends that the reason why so many A merican values  are embedded within Canadian Culture is because of the way Canada has  embraced  American products instead of going down the more costly route of developing it's own. Grant remarks that the moment you take an element from another culture - whether the Model T ford or even the Television - along with the product you adopt and introduce into your culture a number of values which have led to the development of that product.  I guess translating Grant's philosophical analysis into the church's context can be seen by the way in which some movements have in the past decided to completely shun elements of technology and certain societal practices. This has been done, I beleive Grant would say in order to preserve the integrity of the church and it's ability to be distinct from the world in which it operates and distance itself from those things which would compromise the church's message.  From what I've seen first hand however, this practice which Grant says should have happened in the Case of Canadian Culture, and which has been adopted in the past by church movements seems to be a  practice  of  preservation . What I witnessed going on in East London has shown to me that the way forward for the chuch, if it's at all  serious  about it's future ministry, is to take  redemption  into the community. To wrestly with those elements of culture which might appear to undermine the values of the church and threaten it's distinctiveness - to separate the good from the bad - and then redeem those elements of our cultural DNA in order to communicate our message in ways that will be heard and understood.  If we integrate parts of what's around us redeem them and spit them back out at the world we should be able to reach the world in ways it'll understand.

      Hugh Grant, No not the English actor - I'm referring to the Canadian Philosopher -  makes a poignant observation in Lament for a nation. It's a statement concerning the identity crisis plaguing Canada at the moment yet while his remarks are aimed at Canadian cultural identity they may also speak  to the church in it's current identity je ne sais quoi...  In the next few posts as i'm re-reading Lament for a nation I'll post my  thoughts out here onto the thrashing floor.

      In his book Acción pastoral latinamericana, Juan Luis Segundo, writes about how the church has followed a path of making ‘passive followers.’ Our worship practices have not been exempt from this process. Until the darker ages of medieval Christendom, worship was regarded as a ‘liturgy ’ –– a work of the people. During that time, however, for most people worship became an essentially passive event. Eucharist really became at best a private devotion of the clergy rather than a true liturgy. Altars were removed from their central places and pushed against walls, since God was thought to be ‘out there somewhere.’ Priests became the ‘celebrants ’ rather than the ‘presiders ’ who guided the people in the celebration of the community. The words of the service were spoken facing away from the people, most of whom couldn ’t understand the language anyway.They became mere spectators who ‘heard Mass ’ while observing religious art around them. The Reformation saw a return to a more biblical idea of ‘the priesthood of all believers.’ It also drew attention to the need for people to understand the words of worship and read the Scriptures in their own languages.  Recovering from passive mode – rediscovering the “ministry of all believers ” described by Paul in Ephesians 4 – has been a much slower process.   Much of what we hear about worship suggests that it is a one-way activity. Worship is considered our response to God,and God is presumed to be the audience —an audience of One.This is,of course,better than the idea that people are the audience,but it stops short. Emerging generations are finding that one-way worship is ultimately unsatisfactory. That ’s why there is no audience in worship.Not even God remains passive in worship.To worship is to encounter the living God,as when a Samaritan woman encountered Jesus at a well.  We are rediscovering that ‘worship in spirit and truth ’ is just such an encounter. This encounter then forms a centre around which everything else in our lives revolves:praying,singing, proclaiming,our jobs or studies,our play,spiritual growth,day-to-day-life with God,as well as various forms of ministry and mission.It is everything that goes into presenting ourselves to be “living sacrifices to God,” as Paul wrote to some early Christians.That,he wrote,is our ‘reasonable service of worship.’ It ’s a call to participate,to be involved and to engage with God in all of life.It ’s a rediscovery of the work of the people – of liturgy.       The Rev. Dr. George Porter is  diocesan youth action  director.

       Scientists 'read' monkeys' minds   PASADENA, CALIF. - Scientists have trained monkeys to move a cursor around a computer screen by merely thinking about it.  urlLink link   I've often walked away from the church  shakin'  my fists in the air and cried out why can't we train  monkeys  to help us - it'd be so much easier than a PCC. Then of course my fate would be sealed in the need of a continuous supply of bananas.  One of the surprising discovering amongst the titles in my seminary's library is a book on Stalin,  The Highs and Lows - a biography . How odd is that? Perhaps by examining the life of a dictator one day I will be better able to be a  leader  in the church...!?

       Room for the Saints to Speak   One thing I've  found  quite surprising in the past year is that those who have gone before us and who have writen about their own situation can shed incredible insight into what we in the emerging church face.  On the eve of the  urlLink Council of Trent  Ignatius of Loyola wrote the following as part of his charge to those following him.     Tenth rule . We should be  more  ready to approve and praise the decrees and regulations of those in authority, and their conduct as well; for although some of these things are not, or were not , such as to merit approval, to speak against them either in  public sermons  or in conversations in the presence of simple people would give rise more to grumbling and scandal than to benefit. In that way people would become hostile towards authority, either temporal or spiritual. But just as harm can be done by speaking ill to simple people about those in authority in their absence, it can do good to speak of their unworthy behaviour to the actual people who can bring about a remedy.    Those of you who know your history will know that on the eve of the  council of trent , The church was  in need  of far-reaching reform in the realms of both  custom  and  legislation , and  clerical behaviour  and  life-style . In these circumstances, to be faithful to the Church was to crave its reform.  There are a number of ways to do this yet Ignatius here is suggesting something  radical : an emphasis on the dangers of public censure and its insistence that criticism be made behind closed doors.  If we're going to take the Gospel to where it's needed - perhaps this tenth rule should be adhered to.

      The baby  cries  as it's father  shouts  at the attendant working in the airport lobby. Assaulted by words that  no one  should have to  hear , the attendant stands in shock - unable to process what's happening. From no where  Rage  has  taken  centre stage in the departure lounge. The rage  increases  to fury and suddenly from down the corridor  airport security  arrive. The situation is explained yet as the father is  faced  with the attendant again the  rage  is  renewed  and another barrage of wretched language comes  spewing  out of his mouth... despite the officers around her the woman is  paralyzed  by the verbal attacks and  weeps . The pressence of the officers however have calmed the scene and in the lull the baby  stops  her crying... The man refuses to apologize for his outbursts and is escorted away...
