      31st of May 2004  Reinstallation day...Today I had was forced to format and reinstall everything on my system. I had the greatest revelation...i am gonna install another OS on my system only after I get another hard disk. I dont ever wanna go thru the trouble of reinstallation ever again. As they say the process is totally "Mendoukusai"... And I found out the first thing I needed badly to install on my system b4 starting out with anything else was google's toolbar on IE.

      If at all you get to be invited at a formal Japanese dinner you'd be astonished how much vessel washing the Japanese do!!!One look at your food...all that you will see are different varieties of cups, bowls and saucers. Each contaning a small amount of food. The only thing that is available in plenty is rice...sticky rice. Mostly you will end up eating the rice to fill your stomach and drinking the soup little by little to wash it down.   Actually in my experience we all need a game plan to eat Japanese food. First taste everything that is available on your table. Usually the food in the smallest of dishes are the most tastiest. Rate all of these food items in your mind according to their taste starting from one. Give the worst one a score of one and the better tasting ones a higher score. Now divide these rates by quantity of the food item that you have in front of you. Bubble sort the values. Now start with the food item that has the least score and eat accordingly.  A few other important tips:  1) Whatever you do do not keep the rice to the last without saving a little soup to wash it down. There is a danger of choking when you eat sticky Japanese rice.  2) Never mistake the green paste near your sashimi for fresh green colored whipped cream, or a small piece of cake. Better keep it as far away from you as possible.  3) There are 2 similar cups. One containing your tea and other containing your tempura sauce. Never get mixed up with the two. Tempura tastes worser when dipped in tea than when it is dipped in sauce.   Jokes apart it is fun to be eating Japanese food with all that variety and grandeur. Its an opprotunity one gets on very rare occasions. I have found that Japanese rice is the sweetest of all other rice varieties, which explains why it is usually eaten plain. Sashimi tastes great when you dip it in sauce and a tinge of wasabi(the green paste)...you only have to know the correct proportion when you mix them.  The soup usually miso flavored tastes awsome. Sea food comes in diferent shapes and tastes that you can only wonder how they can keep track of them all.   So heres my advice...try Japanese food. A few things might be raw but the experience of eating them is in itself great.

      Imagine sleeping with two housflies in a small room. Trouble with houseflies is they just dont bother to sleep during the night. The have to fly around and one should wonder how they do it but they manage to find exactly where you havent covered you ear.   It all started when I had to go out to pick up my laundry after they were crispy dry. My friends had warned me about insects wandering about in summer... What they dint tell me was that they would be as dangerous as houseflies.  Fat, big and bulky that I am I had to open the door a little extra to easily move out and in....thats when it happened.....I saw those two little villains zoom in through my door, while I stood helpless gaping at them. What was I supposed to do?? Admire the peacock blue colored wings...the slight curve of their bodies....or the way they just randomly kept flying about.  They made a sports ground of my pretty little room... The curtains served as mazes they could fly around in. My computer screen was a novelty to them. One of them enjoyed irrtating my fish through the glass tank...and then came the nightmare....  Not my icecream!!! Thats when I decided to have my revenge....Nobody sits on my icecream!My vanilla flavored icecream with chocolate and fresh whipped cream toppings is definitely forbidden area to any fly.  I quickly covered all my valuables in the room with wrapping sheet and put them into the shelves of my freezer with the swiftness and quietness of a professional Tai Chi practitioner and then took my revenge. My weapon was a humble towel.  I swirled the towel to create a whirl wind...that made them both fly back to the door. With swift motions of the three sliding doors I had them both trapped between two doors...with nowhere to fly except in between doors...  After letting myself out through the third door, I let the two houseflies fly away to live...hopefully happily ever after away from my icecream.   So you readers..who took the pain to read till the end...this is how you let two hoseflies out through three sliding doors.
