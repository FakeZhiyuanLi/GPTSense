       so yeah... me and like 8 or 9 other people went to see The Village expecting to see a real scary movie. well ... talk about a disapointment. that has got to be the worst movie i have seen in ... like forever. we all decided that the poster outside was more scary then the movie itself. and the trailors are totally misleading. i dont mean to give away anything about the movie (which you shouldnt be dum enough to go watch it anyway) but it has nothing to do with little scary monsters ... its just another love story and in the words of todd "that was one messed up village" i mean everyone had some kinda disablity, i mean comeon! well i would tell you more about the dum points in the movie but then i might be giving to much away for those that actually want to see it. the best part of watching the movie is all the funny (yet cheesy) lines in it like : its ok guys... we've got the magic rocks (everyone in the theater cracked up at that one). but anyway after the movie all of us were so disappointed we had to go do something else so we went to ellen's house which was pretty fun. we pretty much listened to kris play the piano, listen to todd play the guitar, eat cheesecake and bread , and watch me kick everyones tail in halo. after ellens house, todd took me home and i went to bed and i guess thats my evening for friday the 30.

       i've been thinking about how in the past few weeks i've heard all sorts of stuff about people thinking that our youth group is nowhere near as close as we should be and too "clickish" and how we have way too much gossip and i've even heard alot of the gossip . and i was thinking to myself ... i've heard all of this negative junk but nothing about the good parts of our youth group or about trying to get our youth group better at its bad points. the way i look at it is this : just don't say anything about it unless its good or unless you are saying it with the intent of making a change in it.  i mean there are several "ring leaders" among the gossip circles (who i will not name) and if we all would just say something every time they start to gossip (or anyone starts in that matter) then maybe we could repair that flaw in our youth group. and as for the people talking about how our youth group is to "clickish": look around!! i havent gone to any church where the youth group is more welcoming and more friendly and you would be hard pressed to find any other place outside of church that would be more friendly or welcoming, actually i would go as far to say that would be impossible to find .you could say that ,that is just because i've been in our youth group for my whole life so i feel comfortable and everyone knows me but i highly doubt that. i can walk up and start a conversation with someone in our youth group that i rarely talk to and they act as if i'm one of there best friends.  another example is jason. he says that this is the best summer he has ever has and also says that this is the best and friendlest youth group he has ever seen. i've gotten to know jason real well these past months and he isnt the kind of person who just says stuff like that just to say it ; he really means what he says. if we all could just stop worrying and wondering about all the "bad stuff" in our youth group and if we do think something is wrong take steps to correct the problem that in itself would be a big step toward making our youth group that much better.

       bla bla bla bla bla Ice Ice Baby Ice Ice Baby All right stop Collaborate and listen Ice is back with my brand new invention Something grabs a hold of me tightly Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly Will it ever stop? Yo--I don't know Turn off the lights and I'll glow To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.    Dance Bum rush the speaker that booms I'm killin your brain like a poisonous mushroom Deadly, when I play a dope melody Anything less that the best is a felony Love it or leave it You better gain way You better hit bull's eye The kid dont play If there was a problem Yo, I'll solve it Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it    Ice Ice Baby Vanilla (4X)    Now that the party is jumping With the bass kicked in, the Vegas are pumpin' Quick to the point, to the point no faking I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon Burning them if they're not quick and nimble I go crazy when I hear a cymbal And a hi hat with a souped up tempo I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo Rollin in my 5.0 With my ragtop down so my hair can blow The girlies on standby Waving just to say HI Did you stop? No--I just drove by Kept on pursuing to the next stop I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block That block was dead    Yo--so I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave. Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine Shay with a guage and Vanilla with a nine Reading for the chumps on the wall The Chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls Gunshots ranged out like a bell I grabbed my nine-- All I heard were shells Fallin on the concrete real fast Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed I'm tryin to get away before the jackers jacke Police on the scene You know what I mean They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends If there was a problem Yo, I'll solve it Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it    Ice Ice Baby Vanilla (4X)    Take heed, 'caese I'm a lyrical poet Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it My town, that created all the bass sound Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground 'Cause my style's like a chemical spill Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel Conducted and formed This is a h*** of a concept We make it hype and you want to step with this Shay palays on the fade, slice it like a ninja Cut like a razor blade so fast Other DJ's say, "D***" If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram Keep my composure when it's time to get loose Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice If there was a problem Yo--I'll solve it! Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it.    Ice Ice Baby Vanilla (4X)    Yo man--let's get out of here! Word to your mother!    Ice Ice baby Too Cold   Ice Ice baby Too Cold Too cold (3X )

       well today was exctremely boring except for the fact that i got my driver's license this morning. it was rather nerve racking and the lady said i was talking to myself the entire way... actually there was really no reason to be nervous, all of the directions and stuff she tells you isn't hard at all... i would go as far to say that its all extremely simple and if you fail it then you must be a horrible driver (seth).  it was only my second time ever to do a three-point turn but thankfully they are extremely simple so that was ok. then there was that guy that was in front of me that just randomly stopped. i was about to start yelling when i remembered the lady in the passenger seat. ok well nothing else really has happened that is worth telling yall so i guess i'll end here

       well... i was going to write about all that has happened today when i recalled... absolutely nothing has happened to day, i ate, i slept, i sat around and thats about all. oh but i did develop a theory last night when i was talking to julie: you know how some people will spend hours opon hours shopping just to save money? well my theory is that since money is time then just go out and buy what you want when you need it and not spend that much time in the process. since money=time you just spent the exact same amount except that you spent more money instead of time while otherwise you would spend more time instead of money. but it all equals out(well at least i like to think it does). i hope that makes since ... i couldn't think of a good way to put it. ok well thats all i feel like typing in for now...

       i don't really have anything philosophical to say so i'll just tell you about my day...well my yesterday (cause i really didnt do anything today) . ok well after church pretty much our entire youth group (minus a few) went over to the brodies house for a cookout/devotional.  it was fun ... until all of the masses of people arrived. i don't mind all the people but i don't like them in such a small space i mean we couldnt even move without stepping on someone. but it was still fun. let me see... jason left yesterday so the cookout was kinda  going away thing for him and that was kinda sad (well at least to me cause i think jason was our best intern yet). but anyway  after the cookout we all just went back to church for evenin services and after that me,julie,donald,and bonny went to the kelly's to watch a movie . we ended up watching confessions of a teenage drama queen which was real dum (except for one real funny part) and that was pretty much the end of the day...
