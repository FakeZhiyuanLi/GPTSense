       Hi All,        I'm really bored and I would like to say that Tara Reid is my celebrity crush. What do you guys think of her? Post a comment telling me what you think, if you have time... I really just want to get comments on my posts...           Thanks,           Jack

       Hi All,   Today, I hung out at the Montclair swim club with some friends and stuff. It was pretty cool. Afterwards, we went out to dinner, or most of us did anyways. We went to Eve's Hunan on College Ave. We ordered kinda sucky food, I think the place just wasn't that good. It's on my bad list for now. Also on my bad list, Laura, she threw a fortune cookie at me and hit me in the eye. I think I did something to provoke it... I said her fortune wasn't going to come true or something. Anyways, we hung out after and Lauren gave me a totally unnecessary, but greatly appreciated ride home so she could get a CD I owed her. But still, that puts Lauren on my good list. So let's recap:      Good List:   -Lauren      Bad List:   -Eve's Hunan   -Laura      That about sums up the day. So I'll talk to you all later.      See Ya,   Jack

       Hi All,   For all you devoted Jack fans who have read every entry I've made, I'd like to say thank you. I've never had a fan before, and I'm almost certain I'm only imagining it now. Anyways, I volunteered at the Rock Ridge branch library again today for another two hours. For the first hour I didn't stop reading my book, "Pet Sematary" by Stephen King. It's really pretty good. Then, the second hour, J. T. Slama came in and he was volunteering as well. We caught up on all the nothing the both of us have been doing over the summer. He built a six story card house out of index cards and McDonald's ice cream cupons and I continued to read in the awkward silences that aren't that awkward if you really don't care, as I did. Anyways, I had another singing lesson afterwards and I learned "Take Me Away" by Plain White T's. It's really simple. That sums up my day so far. Check back later to keep up with my fast-paced life.      Talk to you all later,   Jack

      Hey hey,      I'm up and bored. I know no one reads these, but I figured I'd update... since this afternoon. Anyway, I volunteered at the Rock Ridge branch library from 1-3 p.m. I got out with an hour to kill, but no one was home to hang out with me, and drinking soda and sitting on a curb talking to no one isn't very much fun. I came home and practiced the guitar and was very angry with the world for no reason, so I was in my room most of the afternoon. Dinner was chicken wrapped in bacon and had some herbs and stuff inside it, pasta on the side and a salad. Um, watched the Olympics with my mom, and stuff. Yeah I don't lead what most would call an interesting life, but whatever. School in: 6 days.       Later,        Jack

       Hi All,        This is the first time I've ever done anything like this and I know most of you probably aren't even reading this, but it's kinda fun. I can write whatever I want and post it for anyone to see. Heh heh. Well, not much been going on here, I got a new Marshall 30w amp on Tuesday. It has a really nice sound. Um, I'm saving up to buy an acoustic guitar, preferrably a Taylor, but I'll probably get an Epiphone. Oh well. If anyone I don't know is reading this, please IM me... I don't have many frineds...           Bye for now,          Jack
