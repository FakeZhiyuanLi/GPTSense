      In my search for new and inspiring ideas, I came across urlLink  this little fellow .  This guy is the coolest and most awesome guy I've ever seen. I hope my child will grow up to be just like him.  Anyway, back to the inspirational.   "Who wants to see Lil' John and Barry Manilow collaborate (because they both have cool hair( i.e.  urlLink awesomeness A  and  urlLink awesomeness B )  ). "  Note to nick ball: could you possibly morph those two images using your godly photoshop skills? please?   The ingenious last line to my poem, wow, i can tell I'm going to fail this class already.

      For some awful reason that quote from Pride and Prejudice has been running through my mind all day long like a Britney Spears song.... whoa... that rhymed. lol. Anyway, so today was the first day of public school and I have to say it was the strangest group of people I've ever seen in my life. I mean that in a good way, diversity is key. I think.  Well, I totally botched first period because no one told me we had to pick up our locker numbers in another classroom.  I didn't even get to use my locker by the way, ok maybe I got to walk by and say hi, but that's about it.  I walked into the wrong classroom a couple of times, and that was kind of embarassing.  I had a group to sit with at lunch though (the cheerleaders..ooo... yeah whatever), and despite how stressed out I was I actually managed to make friends.  I didn't meet anyone cool until I had my smart classes.  I'll tell you, that's where its at, yo. So, all in all, it wasn't horrible. My assignment for english is to write a poem, a non-rhyming poem. (i think reason that quote above has been running through my head) I'm probably spending way too much time and putting way too much effort into this simple "getting-to-know-you" excercise, but I just can't get past it. I don't know what to finish with...     Nicole, Very observant, quick to laugh, quirky habits, Sibling of no one, Lover of music, movies, and mozzarella, Who feels the need to always improve, Who needs only a nice place to sleep and some neopolitan ice cream, Who knows not what Iâ€™m doing in this poem, Who fears large crowds and furry spiders, Who would like to see... the world inundated in molten candle wax? 	Neubarth   ok, so it's retarded at best, but its a work in progress!!! ok?!? Insight much appreciated, thank you.  Love, nikore

      FYI, completely disreguard any titles because there is no corelation between them and the entries themselves.  Most people will find them annoying and well, stupid, but hey i try.  So anyway, I was just having a normal sunday today. Yesterday I had Kassi over, and she saw my new room.  I got that warm fuzzy feeling because she thought my room was so cute and was throughly impressed with my guitar playing.  You don't get those kinds of compliments everyday, you know.  It keeps me going.  As of late, i've been sitting in my rope swing for hours at a time, as many of my friends know...lol. It's a great place to think.  So...I was thinking, in the great scheme of things it really doesn't matter if you have a boyfriend or not.  The grass is still green, the sky is still blue, you still have to wear sunscreen, still have to finish your homework, do the laundry, etc. so i ask you, why do so many people my age have boyfriends/girlfriends, many of whom are completely dependent and obbsessed with their significant other.  Some have come to the conclusion that everyone is just horny, but if that is the case then why not just find some random person... i don't know. I don't think I'm going to waste my time anymore. By going to camp, I saw that there are definitely "more fish in the sea", so really I have no other concerns in that department until I'm much older. If I do meet a guy next year and he's "soooo perfect" , then I guess I'll consider it, but otherwise... bleh. lol. Ok, enough, I know, I'm sorry.  I won't even get into the other things I've been thinking about. Soo, yeah, I'll leave you with this disturbing joke... "Your daddy is so dumb, he thought I was a hooker!" Really think about that one...doesn't it creep you out?!       nicole

      Well, well, well.  I see you have stumbled onto my masterpiece, my highly anticipated blog!  ... You get excited easily, there's absolutely nothing here. calm down.  See, I started one about 2 weeks ago, and I recently read one of the entries I had made and I had noo idea what I was talking about.  I figured if I thought it was crazy then everyone else would think it was. Now, you still think I'm crazy, but to a lesser degree than say, before when you would have told me to see a physcologist... or something. yeah, ok im an idiot.  This being my first entry, I've decided to only let you read a tiny morsel of what's to come... so.... here it is.... "Today when I woke up, I saw that my wall was still white, thank goodness. (I was afraid it was red, can you imagine?!) Anyway, I made myself a pancake, i use the singular because the first one I made looked like a dying rabbit and I try not to eat anything with a face, so yeah, i ate my one, lonely pancake." OMFG! That's only about 15 minutes into my day, and I'm already blown away by how captivating it is. Until next time my friends, make sure your pot is free of harmful additives.   nnnicole
