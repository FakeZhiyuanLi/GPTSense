      I'm fed up with liberals badmouthing Bush - granted   we gave Clinton a firm tongue lashing ever chance we   got - but he actually earned it.    Bush sticks to the beliefs he affirms and maintains   his values and faith in his policies. He actually   does what he says he will do - what a concept!  He knew as much as the Clinton administration and the   intelligence operative told him.  --- Oil! Oil! We are fighting for OIL!!! No - we are fighting to liberate Iraqis - it would be   far far easier, less expensive, and less politically   motivated to drill in ANWAR and build some more   refineries.  Better yet - why don't we kill and skin   all of the caribou or elk or whatever they are - feed   thehomeless and drill all of ANWAR.  We can buid   refineries all around it and save a fortune in   shipping it back and forth to refineries.  We'll    refine it there and ship pump ready to go gasoline   back to the states!  -- He hates the wilderness! He is for all the lumber   companies cutting down all the trees!!   Are you really that stupid? Level all trees and   effectively put themselves out of business?  HAHAHA  LOLOLOLOL - no - they replant trees.   -- He's sending thousands of children to die in war!  No - everyone who signs up for the military knows the   risks and they are very aware of all possibilities.   They are adults and they make that choice of their   own free volition.  Cut the umbilical chord already!

      The U.N. is UN-effective UN-Cooperative and Un-necessary.  Why should we have to worry about the opinion of the   rest of the world when the only groups that should be   concerned with our decision making is the groups we   affect directly?    I say Screw the U.N. and all the pandering leftist   whiners in LA and New York. That being said they have   the right to free speech. (If the founders had seen   this coming...)  If we are going to have an impact on terror - how can   we play by rules that our enemy doesn't play by?    The Geneva convention doesn't even apply in this case   because A: they are NOT soldiers, and B: The Geneva   Convention only applies to those countries that have   signed it. (Al Qaida is NOT a country)  It also applies to prisoners of war - but I've known   of Fraternity hazings worse that what those people   went through.  (I know-I know, but just because they didn't want you   there and you knew you didn't belong doesn't mean you   should whine and get a legal precedent to suppress   the decades of cameraderie and tradition inherent in   the hazing-initiation process - get a clue and get   over it)  Just because you don't like something   doesn't mean its wrong.    As an aside here I can assure you that many things   you liberals like ARE wrong.  But you don't   understand morals either... tsk tsk tsk... Poor Bill   had to sleep on the couch for 2 whole months...

      Slavery is over. What really pisses me off is - I   don't owe reparations and MY ANCESTORS NEVER OWNED   SLAVES!!! Reparations are the stupidest idea in the   world.  Yeah - slaver was prevalent - in many   countries and civilizations - yeah it was wrong and   was a dark time in our history - but ITS OVER!!!   People pushing for equality are  more prevalent than   ever pushing that mind numbing shut you up philosophy   of race baiting conversations and censoring free   speech by pushing the PC views we have been inundated   with.   I have several black/hispanic/and a few asian   friends. I do not look down on them at all - I see   them as equals - and they are in every sense.   They are on my level intellectually, socially, and   in most cases economically.  The people I look down   on are the loud, brash, annoying people who play the   race card effectively ending all discussion.   "I'm right because I'm... 'insert racial minority   here.'"   "And you better shut up and let me talk because your   grandaddy owned my grandaddy"... and so it goes.    Let me restate this... MY ANCESTORS NEVER OWNED   SLAVES!!!  Ok - that behind me - we are truly in a sad state of   affairs. Why should anyone get a job/a college   acceptance/a step up in line - based on racial   preference and profiling? Thats stupid and just   completely backwards to the idea of promoting   equality.  Does anyone else see a problem here?  I   don't even think your race should be listed on any   federal documents - they shouldn't be able to see any   of that for any inclusion in any process. How does   allowing for open spots in universities for a certain   number of race accomplish anything?  They should get   your name, grades, essay, and list of activities and   accomplishments.  Thats it - that is all that   admissions should require - and be privy to in any   institution.   We need to promote healthy competition - not racial   infighting.  Would you rather meet racial quotas in   your business or hire people based on their   experience and capability of performing the job? My   dad went for an interview and the interviewer told   him he was next in line to be hired - but they had to   hire a racial minority and a woman to fill government   mandates and turned him away!!! WTF?

      Racism Inherent in Democratic Party and Liberal Ideology  So you think Conservatives are racist?  Why are   Condileeza Rice and Colin Powell in the   adminstration?  Why do conservatives oppose welfare?  ITS NOT A   RACIAL THING!!!  We contend that welfare is not effective and is   contrary to an effective government.  Actually we oppose big government and want as little   government interference as possible in our lives.  By giving handouts to people who are able bodied to   work - they are merely teaching people to be lazy.    We know you're capable - if you try.  A rock has   potential - but the finest granite can't reach that   potential without work.  It just sits there. I'm all for TEMPORARY benefits - but when we have   third and fourth generation welfare families   (families whose main source of income is welfare) its   a pathetic epidemic and needs to be stopped. This is   not some Myth the VWRC dreamed up either - my Mom   used to work in an office distributing welfare checks   - she knows first hand.  Its pathetic. The liberals   lie and say we want to take away whats rightfully   yours while they take our money from us - the working   people and giving it to those who do literally   nothing.  I'm all for TEMPORARY unemployed benefits -   but anybody can get a job at Wal-Mart or McDonalds   while holding out for something better.   The liberal would rather enslave you to the welfare   system - give you money that is essentially buying   votes and allow you to be lazy.  Then they claim that   conservatives want to take away what they GAVE you in   their vast campaign to get power by manipulating   those they keep under their shoes.  They are enslaving the lower class - to a system that   they put together only to stay in power.

      I don't know what this guy was thinking - but this is definitely extreme fanatacism.  He actually wrote a book about a guy wanting to kill Bush - and he doesn't even bother an attempt at trying to veil it!!! It seems to me He's just some left wing wacko trying to entertain his fantasy in plain view - by thinly disguising his own desires as fiction.  (and rubbing it in everyone's faces) But I'm sure he expects this kind of response as a selling point.

      Well, now there's the proof we've been looking for.  Apparently at least two of Kerry's medals are now under scrutiny from veterans in general - and his former commander in specific.  His commanding officer actually denied his request for a purple heart and what did he do?  Got someone else to ok it and sent in the paper work!!! Here's the news story link:   urlLink http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&amp;pk=KERRY-MEDALS-08-04-04

      I don't begrudge the Democrats as a party affiliation, I know there hearts are in the right place and I realize that there are problems within both parties.  I think the issues are the same and we have two ways of looking at them.  Democrats take issue with healthcare - wanting to provide for others an affordable system, stem cell research so that diseases that vex us may be cured, abortion - wanting a person to have the right to choose, economy - wanting to help people acheive more - and making businesses responsible, education - making the schools more effective, efficient, and accountable to families and students.  You want people to be equally afforded opportunities and allowed to compete for the same resources.   As I'm sure you are well aware, the duality of the political system is split - not because of these issues - but how we would choose to resolve them.  You see, Republicans also take issue with healthcare costs - wanting to provide for others who work or have worked in the past, - not giving people (who don't work) cheap (quality wise)  healthcare at the expense of people who already pay a lot for quality healthcare.  We don't want to water down the system denying ourselves the little we do have at our own expense.  We have seen the ideals of liberals (good in concept) fall apart.  Its good to be forward thinking and idealistic, but not to the point that you handicap the nation in pursuit of grandiose ideas that are only half thought-out.   Stem cell research is fine - if it does not involve harming a fetus or using other unethical practices - its not the research that's the problem - but the means.  Abortion - we generally differ based not on the woman's right - they should have rights - but the baby can not speak for itself - the mother made her choice - as did the father when they chose to have intercourse, in the case of rape - the child should still be born. There are alternatives to raising it if it is a financial hardship. (Other than killing it)   We differ on the economy as we both want to help people achieve more by helping small businesses achieve and giving hiring incentives like tax breaks- when you tax businesses more they tend to lay off employees for higher profit margins - but if you give them tax breaks they create jobs.  This also stimulates the economy by giving employees more money in their pockets to spend on products and services - rendering more tax money to the government through sales - as a choice they make - not being strong armed into higher federal taxes.    Education - making the schools more effective, efficient, and accountable to families and students can also be acheived through vouchers - because by giving people a choice in their education - the schools will be forced to compete and by virtue will become better.  Its like any business or restaurant - if they are forced to compete with competition they have to become better - or they will no longer be in operation and another restaurant or school will come along and take their place.   Democrats want people to be equally afforded opportunities and allowed to compete for the same resources. Both parties have this view.  But we believe in a completely colorblind society - by not considering race as a factor at all and diminishing it as a box to check on all documents; rather than giving anyone any leg up based on their ethnicity. Our party is often referred to as racist by the fringe elements or your party and I think many see us that way.  Most of us say the same of yours based on democrats perpetually keeping people in poverty by keeping them dependant on handouts - and not offering incentive to work harder and make a life for themselves.  Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day... Teach him to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime.  This is a problem inherent in your your socialist ideology - you assume that everyone will settle for what eveyone else has - in essence average out into a communistic community leaving the few elites to rule and everyone to have all the same stuff. The problem in this is you ignore human's competitive nature as well as the American's keeping up with the Jones's lifestyle (which may not be the best idealogically, but it's what we are all used to.) In essence it smore like you are taking away from everyone to make everyone equal - except for minorities because they get special treatment.  Everyone else must suffer.  This seems to be the most centrist theme in your policies.  The DNC frequently made reference to divisive politics. I see nothing more devisive and dividing to the American public than constantly putting down their leader for standing by his decisions and seeing them through.  I see nothing more devisive than attacking our patriotism and religious views.  I see this far more often on the left.  Our liberties are important - but laws and rules and traditions are important to our values because without standards and guidelines chaos will reign.  The moral relativism is shattering the values of our youth and the perceived "rights" that are really nothing more than expected privelege - are molding future generations into spoiled whiners  - with no historical context and little more than expectation of others to get them by.      On the international level the Democrats want to rely on other nations that at best have proven ineffective - and at worst - untrustworthy - While Conservatives trust ourselves to get the job done and will see our ideals through because we are in it for the long haul and come heck or high water we will acheive our goals regardless of the time or cost. We won't whine that its not getting done fast enough - because we will stick through till the end.  People like Michael Moore would have you believe that kids are dying when in reality they are 18-year-old adults who made the choice to join the militray knowing full well the implications thereof.  He tells you Bush lied when he went by the same intelligence everyone else trusted. We all found the results together - at the same time.  We are all in this together. Bush also won all of the recounts in Florida based on the rules set out before the election. It seems to people that you're party will do anything to win - including acting like the election was stolen, rigged, and making the outher guy out to be a liar - when he is not. The negative politics seem to be coming from one side thus far - and it seems like it is from the left - regardless of how often Kerry espouses the adverse.   When activist judges begin writing laws defying the majority rather than interpreting existing laws - we are in trouble.  When a party will do anything to achieve/stay in power - it is scary. I fear for the state of democracy because of what is being done.  All citizens should have a say in the process, but when the will of the people is disrupted based on the desires of a few amoral - hippocritical whiners who want nothing other than our way of life and values destroyed so they may pervert our nations very foundation and ruin everything we stand for - it's time for something radical to be done.  It's time to get back to our basics, and weed out corruption and spiritual abandon.  It's time to stand up and say NO!  We will not go quietly into the night!  We will not stand by and watch the liberals and media and educational systems pervert our children's perceptions; we will not allow them to ruin our sense of morality or our values and we will NOT stand for pluralism and moral relativism.  If you want to screw up your kids and your own life, may God help you - but the moment you force your unGodly views on me - you have a problem.
