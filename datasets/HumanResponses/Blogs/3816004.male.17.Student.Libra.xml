      Yeah.... The latest week for me has been meaning work... All days, even today, Saturday, which kinda sucks, I work in a Supermarket called ALTA in a city 5 km's from where I live, that means that I have to ride 5 km's on my bicycle to get to work, and the same to get home, and I am  lazy !  But one week is well passed, also have to work next week. When all this is done, there is only a couple of days left of my holidays for this time, can't believe 6 weeks has already passed at this time. I'll be starting on my second year on HTX (Higher Technical Exam (Upper secondary school)) on Tuesday the 3rd August, and I am in no way looking forward to it, I hate school.  Tomorrow I'll have a visit from one of my very good friends from school, called Marc, we'll be geeking with our computers for a couple of days :)  For other news, I haven't been able to pull myself together to get read anything at all in my book for the latest days - The Da Vinci Code - which sucks, because, in some way I have to be done with it before I start in school again, there won't be time for much else than school reading when that time comes unfortunately.

      Well... Now it's monday, and I've started working again, though, it's not like full time, only a little more than 3 hours a day, but gosh, it sucks having to go to work, doessn't feel like holidays at all, also it reminds me that I have to start in school again in 2 weeks... 'Yay', to say it soft, I don't like going to school, I don't seem to be able to spend my time doing something that I don't like, and that sucks when you have to make a couple of hours homework every day  I've decided to try and change my ways of school a bit for the second year of my senior high school, since the workload there is much higher that the first. If this does not succeed, I will prolly not be able to get the year done... We'll see!  Started painting my room today, or well, my mom did, since I had to go to work, it's going to be some kind of white with a little sand'ish shade over it :)  I've started being rather active in the forums over at deviantART.com, I actually like it very much, it feels nice helping out the new people asking questions, and participating in the community like that is also really nice I think

      So yeah... Up late once again :| I'm sorry, nothing to do about it I guess, having holidays is almost an equal to me for sitting up late surfing the internet, that's how it goes when the weather isn't as good as it is supposed to.  I have a couple of projects at the moment, today I started clearing out my room, removing everything, to get ready to start dropping some paint on the walls tomorrow. At the moment, it's all green, and that makes my room look rather small and compact, so I'm going for some light white color when I go out buying it tomorrow. Also, I'll be needing something to put on the walls, nothing is more boring than 4 empty walls, I have been thinking about buying a couple of prints from deviantART.com [ My DeviantART wishlist ].  Though, I don't know if I can afford that in this month, the money are running a bit low, due to the trip to France last week and so. We'll see, maybe I can get some financial support from my beloved parents ;)  Another thing I have been thinking about, is a short presentation of the Internet pages I visit the most, with a small description about why I use them, and what the main idea of them are, we'll see, maybe after the room is painted and everything is moved in again!

      Yeah, been rather busy in my holidays already if you read my other journals, way too much stuff to do, the last 2 days, I've been visiting the Danish capital Copenhagen... So much places to go and see there, so many people :) We have a lot of family there, so we lived in my cousins appartment, since they were out in the summer residence  For the next 2 weeks I will be working, though it's only in the night, 17:00-20:15,  soooo  boring, but the money are okay though!

      Normally, I do not read a lot, and especially not books, generally I prefer just reading what I stumble upon. Like texts for school, stuff on the internet, manuals for stuff I buy and all that, but recently I was told by a couple of people on  urlLink DeviantART  that I simply had to read the book "The Da Vinci Code" by Dan Brown [ Amazon.com ], and I ordered it.   Since I am not used to read a lot, it is rather special for me to get as caught up by a book as I am with this one, first of all, I decided that I wanted to have it in English, which required me to order it from USA, which is also the first time I have done like that to get a book. But well, I am totally caught by the book, the story in it is so well done, and I read in it as often as I can. I already have ordered another of Dan Brown's books called "Angels and Demons" [ Amazon.com ], really looking forward to read that one too :)

      Well well, yeah, I decided to try out this kind of a weblog, I used to be a user on  urlLink modblog.com , but I like this kind more, where I can have it on my own page and all that :)  Also, I count on having this one a bit more active, but let’s see!  I hope it will contain my general thoughts of the day, and a little journal on what's going on in my life in general  This,  also is the first post here, so it will just remain an info post about  what I've been doing for the last 3 months or something like that, it  will mainly just tell a little bit about me.  To start off, I'll  start around when my holidays started this year, which was the 19th  June, in the first weekend after this, me and my father left for a  little drive up through Sweden, to Finland and home again through  Norway, we left at Saturday, and was home again the Saturday after. The  special thing about our way of traveling is that my father has a  Land-Rover, where we can sleep in the back of the car, really nice  actually :) The trip was on around 4500 km's, so we drove much of the  time.  After this, I had a week of relaxing mostly, then I went together with some friends on a trip to France, to a  urlLink major gaming event   called ESWC, held in a place called Futurescope, I was there because I  am an administrator in the Danish organization HLTV.org, what we do is  broadcast games for public viewing, an example on the size is that  20.000 people watched the finals of the event. This was a rather nice  but expensive trip, costed me around 300$, which is a lot for an  everything but wealthy student like me :)   That much for the first post!

      So... I just watched " Fahrenheit 9/11 ", the highly discussed movie by Michael Moore, and well, what do I think about it? It's very informative, I was amazed to hear all the stuff told in it, and much of it is unbelievable too. The documentary about the war and the American politics in general made me as interested in a movie as I have never been, I have now spent a couple of hours reading about movie in general, it's astounding.   The movie has so much information, and is put together in a way that tells you that the war in Iraq, the whole thing about Bush, is all bogus, what Bush caused to happen after 9/11 2001, is amazing, how he has survived with getting even more popular than he was when being elected stuns me. How a man, of his thoughts can be elected as a president, if he actually was so... I guess that we will never know.  The way that Michael Moore shows all the facts and actions done in this movie, is something I like a lot. Normally I am not a person going in and writing or discussing politics, especially not outside my own country, but if it is at all possible to say that this subject has not been discussed and talked about enough, I would for sure disagree, this movie shows so much that people all over the world simply should know. The way that everything is shown, and told, it makes me wanting to read and see more, and if you ask me, that's the way every documentary should be like!  I am sure that I will be viewing this movie a couple of times again, and reading all the stuff I found on the Internet regarding the subject lots of times, also, this is some that I for sure will discuss with some of my American friends, to hear their thoughts on it, because it is simply not clear to me how all of this can have happened. Getting an “insider’s” view on this will for sure be something needed for be to understand it, so I think at least, seeing it from different sides is something very important to me.  Furthermore, I think this is one of the blogs I have written that I will return to a couple of times, to actually get to know what people think about the things I have said about this subject, it's unbelievable to me how different thoughts can have on politics, and the mind blowing ideas people can get. The stunt that Bush has made is one of these, the introduction to the ways he work is unbelievable, I for one did not have any idea that he had the future he has had. I guess the my thoughts about Bush, before watching this movie was something like this: "George W. Bush is a former soldier serving USA, his father is also a former President of USA, and George W. Bush is now the president of the USA" - or whatever. If you have not already seen "Fahrenheit 9/11," it is one of the movies I will tell my friends that they have to watch and understand, not just see it like a normal movie, but do all what they can to understand what is actually told in it. As previously said, I have not understood it enough from seeing it once, but as you might see here, it has already set up a lot of thoughts in my head, making me have to understand it to its full.  As I might previously have told here, I am a heavy user of the page DeviantART.com, on this page there has recently been a couple of political polls, starting massive discussions, since DeviantART is a site mainly used by Americans, of course we also see an overweight of Americans commenting in these polls, to say a bit about how one of these polls looks like, the question is like this:  urlLink Do you plan to vote in the upcoming November election?   To get to the point, I did in this poll write  urlLink a comment , saying:  "Same here :) But well, I hope that for once the Americans will take a decent decision :D"  This was said with smiley’s in it, to make sure that people would understand that I did not actually mean what I said to it's fullest, but that I wouldn't mean that the election of George W. Bush was not done as it was supposed to, this people could of course not understand, I wouldn’t have been able to code off my own brain there either, but me saying this simply made an extreme discussion go live, I have not yet been able to take the time to read all the comments written on it, because the amount and the size of them is rather amazing. An example could be  urlLink this , where the deviant (DeviantART user)  urlLink ennui-demorte  comments on something another guy wrote, just by looking at the size of this comment, you will understand how some people see politics, and how serious people take it, and should take it. I do at least personally have a lot of reading to do, and some exploring to do also.  I hope all of this makes just a bit of sense, because it is something I have spent a lot of time writing, and I will for sure make a follow-up on this, as soon as possible!  Links: -  urlLink michaelmoore.com  -  urlLink Fahrenheit911.com  -  urlLink IMDB.com about the movie  -  urlLink The Trailer of the movie  -  urlLink Fifty-nine Deceits in Fahrenheit 9/11

      Yeah... Well... Started in school again, before the holidays, I wasn't very happy about it, and I think you can easily say that the same counts now.   The only reason for me actually taking this edication, is that I have to have something on the papers before I can go on with my life, and get a higher education, and after that.... In maybe like 8 years or so, get a job where I can earn the money I need for whatever I am going to do.  My main interests at the moment lays mainly in the world of anything releated to computers, whether that's software, hardware or just in general.  I spend lots of time on the internet, and I am about to start my own little company selling different online services together with a  urlLink friend , who I've known for quite some time now. We are about to get a server placed on a data-center, and from that, run something called "Bouncers", these are used by people who use IRC (Internet Relay Chat) at lot, to keep them online on IRC all the time, and not loose any private messages and whatsoever. The market in these is not  big , but it is for sure there.  The company is to be called  urlLink G72 , due to me buying this domain some time ago. Where the name comes from, no one knows, not even myself, but I believe it's a name that people remember, and that will hopefully only help us get more customers.  At the moment, we are working on the more basic stuff, like getting the server online, gathering "Virtual Hosts" and writing different stuff. We have just started to begin the coding of an administration system, used by the users, I've been thinking about some PHP+Telnet+TCL coding, but we'll see what gets done!  Also, today, I had my first class in Programming, where we'll learn the basics of C++, today, we had a small lecture in the classic "Hello World!", and a bit calculations through variables, rather basic and boring if you ask me, but I hope that it will get just a bit more advanced during the year here  We will only have 2*60 mins of Programming class per week, so it won't be the most intensive class. I will also start another brand new subject tomorrow, "Information Technology", that class itself is ok I guess, but we recently found out that we are going to have the teacher we also have for math here, and from what I can tell, he is not the most clever mind to put behind a computer. But... Since I don't know yet exactly what the class will be like, and what we will have to teach, I can of course not tell, but I am awaiting the worst :|  In other news, I have decided that I will not put a 'schedule' on what I am going to write blogs, I'll just write when I feel I have something to say, also, I hope to be buying "mtscherning.com" or "mikkeltscherning.dk" or whatever I'll stick to as soon as possible  Greets

      So... Just watched the movie Super Size Me, if you haven't heard about it, it is about an american man, only living from food from McDonalds in 30 days, yeah... one month that is. This movie, or documentary as you might call it, is far beyond informative, I really found it interesting watching it.  Here are some facts about the american way of living:  -  Each day, 1 in 4 Americans visits a fast food restaurant  -  In 1972, we spent 3 billion a year on fast food - today we spend more than 110 billion  -  McDonald's feeds more than 46 million people a day more than the entire population of Spain  -  French fries are the most eaten vegetable in America  -  You would have to walk for seven hours straight to burn off a Super Sized Coke, fry and Big Mac  -  In the U.S., we eat more than 1,000,000 animals an hour  -  60 % of all Americans are either overweight or obese  -  One in every three children born in the year 2000 will develop diabetes in their lifetime  -  Left unabated, obesity will surpass smoking as the leading cause of preventable death in America  -  Obesity has been linked to: Hypertension, Coronary Heart Disease, Adult Onset Diabetes, Stroke, Gall Bladder Disease.....  [ Lend from supersizeme.com where you can read the rest of these facts ]  I myself is one of those people who could possibly have been in this movie, I don't eat fast food often, but I sure like it, at the moment I am on a diet arranged by my mother mainly, and untill now, I have already lost 6 Kg's (~13 pounds), in a little more than a month... And I personally and mentally feel so much better from it.  So well, back to the movie... This guy, Morgan Spurlock, gains more than 20 pounds during these 30 days, he gets sick, and whatmore... This is for sure a movie worth watching, and I am sure it will change your view on fast food how we see it today!

      So, it's getting to the end of the lovely summer holidays, 7 great weeks, passing by way too fast, it's been feeling like it's only a couple of days. That's a bit sad if you ask me, because I could for sure use a couple of weeks more before getting started with my HTX again, I'm meeting today for the first class, at 10:50, fortunately, it's a bit late, I normally meet at 8:30.  The latest couple of days has been quite ok, apart from 2 weeks of hard work, the last weekend was a bunch of fun. There was a summer-party, or whatever it might be called, in the city I live in, which equals to a lot of parties in the town, a fair, beer, beer and beer!  Yesterday was another hard day too, spent the most of the morning formatting my laptop, so that it's ready for going to school again, it started to get a bit slow and all that, so it had to get formatted, this also included taking backup of all the old stuff, 17 Gb...... quite a lot data to be copied through FTP to one of the other computers, and then fetched back to the laptop afterwards, a lot of it is photographs I've taken during the latest time, and a bunch of music too.  Also, yesterday I took the time to try out the new Doom3, it's damn scary! I played for maybe an hour, where it started to get rather scary to sit alone in my dark room, so... well, I turn on some light behind me, but when turning that one on, it explodes! And I'm serious,  booooom ! I haven't got up off my chair that fast ever before, hope that says a bit about how nice the game actually is, the gameplay is awesome. Though, unfortunately, there are also very high system requirements, I almost can't play it on my 1.6 GHz Centrino laptop  That's all for today/night, I'll be back soon ;)
