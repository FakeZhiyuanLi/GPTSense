      Today for lunch me and Luke went to the chow hall. (Galley) I still think Navy most of the time around here. Pressing on, I walked out and saw this guy that I met playing cards the other night. I tapped him on the shoulder and said hello. He looked at me stunned, and said wow you look different when your in uniform. But anyways, I was thinking wait but he saw me yesterday.&nbsp;   Yesterday, when April and I were walking to the galley, some guy in uniform walked out and headed straight for me. He grabbed my face didn't say a word and said I'll see you later. I thought it was the same guy from today. I know was drinking Saturday night, but I know I could still recognize people. I thought it was really wired.&nbsp;Guys look so different when they are in uniform. Especially when they have the hat and all on.&nbsp;Maybe it's a case of mistaken identity. Who knows. It was all just really wired!!! Hum, I don't know what the hell is going on around here.   And another odd thing. I'm walking out of the bathroom today at school and this Marine is staring me down. I swear it looked like I just killed his dog. So I walked down the hall and there he was again, making complete eye contact with me. With one of those faces that say, I know you from somewhere but can't place it. I looked right at him, and I'm pretty sure I have no idea who he is. I feel like I'm being watched and it's starting to freak me out.   Ah, then the ex calls today. We're still friends and I try to help out whenever I can. He's been having some girlfriend problems lately, so I was trying to give him advice. Well I guess I wasn't very much help because she came to his work today and returned his toothbrush and PJ's.  I haven't spoken to him in months and just last week he called with this dilemma. Then he tells me today that I'm the one, blah blah blah. I made it plain and clear that I am in a wonderful relationship, and I&nbsp;love&nbsp;John more than anything in this world. So I don't think we'll be speaking anytime soon. Oh well, ta ta David.   I really miss John. None of this wired shit happens when he's around. Still no word since Saturday. I don't think I'll be hearing from him for awhile. Such is life when your man is deployed to ends of the Earth.   By the way, I passed that project I was freaking out about. I can't believe I did everything right on it!!! I have to stop always doubting myself. Well I should go and study. Two more tests left and shit load of briefings and then I'm done!   &nbsp;

      I went to class this morning and finished one of the projects I was working on. I had a mild freak out attack when I thought I wasn't going to finnish on time and I was going to fail!!!! Ugh, I tell you the stress is absolutely ridiculous.  I did Finnish on time, but, I'm concerned as usual. The instructor came in and said that more than one person failed and he'll tell us tomorrow who it is. Thanks asshole, I'll sleep well on that note.   But. I come home from lunch and Carol is awake. She's never up that early, and she looked pissed. She said "there's a reason that I'm up this early and I'm not happy about it." I guess the colonel and her posse, the shirt, some other guy came through to do inspections today. There have "numerous" complaints about the partying coming from this room. Which is all very interesting because we don't really party all that much. I mean sure on the weekends. And it's not just us. Luke and 3 other guys live right next door, so it's there area too.   I guess some of the discrepancies were cigarette butts in an ashtray! Too many folding chairs on the porch. And a garbage can that's out there. These are all considered fire hazards or some stupid shit.   So they all came into my room. Thank gawd that it was semi clean today. I mean after the weekend it's usually trashed but for some reason I cleaned it yesterday. It kind of freaked me out a little that they came in my room and looked at my pictures and stuff, enough to comment on John's picture when he was in the sand. They said something to Carol about him being very good looking, and started asking where he was and what he did. Carol pretty&nbsp;much in the nicest way possible told them it was none of their business. Even though she knows, she wasn't going to say. And they were also curious about the pictures I have of my uncles from WWII. Man what a bunch of nosey people. Inspect the fucking room and get out. I wish they would let us live off base sometimes.   Anyways. We have&nbsp; a re-inspect. on Thursday and Friday. They said the place looked nice, but the shit outside had to go. I hope they don't wake Carol up again.   So that's it for today. I'm going to get something to eat, and then I have to study. Take care.

      TODAY HAS BEEN GREAT!!!!  I woke up this morning and the porch and room was semi-clean. I played cards last night with the boys until about 6 am. So it was a pleasant surprise to see that they had cleaned up! YEAH!  I think me getting pissed off last week actually made them wake up!  I talked to John this morning. That's probably what really made my day. He was so cute on the phone. I told him I was going to Mexico next weekend to go shopping again. He said, "don't take a purse or anything, just carry your ID and money." "Don't leave the boarder town and roam around Mexico." Ah, he's so sweet.  I did get a new key board today, my old one decided to take a shit on me. I was typing along and then it just quit. So, that's why there are no entry's for the last couple of days.   Well it's off to the court yard, people are out there drinking tonight. So it should be fun. I will try not to do anything too crazy.   &nbsp;

      After almost failing my targeting test (and can someone just let me know when a KC-135 starts dropping bombs, I just might give a shit.) and finding out that Grandpa will not be rejoining us, and the fact that I haven't heard from John. I went to the mini mart and bought a bottle of my good old friend Captain Morgan. I haven't drank it since leaving Cuba.   So I started drinking and Top Gun was on. So of course I had to watch it. It used to be one of my favorite movies of all time! I loved it, until this course. I found out that there is no MiG-28 unfortunately it's nothing but an F-5 that's painted black with a red star. It broke my heart. The more and more I watch it, the more I find wrong with it. It's almost like finding out your friend lied to you. It's very sad.   Anyway back to the Captain. Do you know how much&nbsp;a bottle of it costs now? Well considering I could buy a 5th for about $7, it was quite a shock to find out that here it's about $17. Sometimes I really miss Cuba.   So not only did we test this morning, we also tested&nbsp;again this afternoon. After the dreaded first test and me calling my command and telling them how much they screwed me, for sending me here, we jumped right into the next block. After about 2 hours of lecture we tested again! It wasn't that bad at all because it was all message traffic. Which by the way, if I were ever to type or send messages out that looked like that, the Navy would have strung me up! I found multiple discrepancies. It actually kind of pissed me off. I mean that was my profession for only about 4 years and to degrade it like that, was sick. I swear some people should NOT be allowed to venture into the comm's aspect of things (ie. Intel).   Anyway. I talked to Lucy for about an hour tonight. We were just gossiping. It was so good to hear her voice again. She has been awarded the American Legion award and is going to get it presented to her in Tennessee. She always out-shines everyone else. Even when were together in GTMO and Iceland. She is trying to schedule a visit down here to see me. I can't wait!!!! Her and I are complete opposites. She plays the game so well, I on the hand, seem to always get in trouble with my mouth.    Well it's getting late and I&nbsp;have to be awake at 5:30 am, so&nbsp;I must&nbsp;be going. I miss and love you all.

      I almost forgot.   Rowland was talking about his fraternity this morning when I walked in. I was pretty surprised that he was in one, so I said "Rowland I didn't know you were a frat boy." He replies with "It's not a frat,&nbsp;it's a fraternity, you don't call your country a cunt do you?"   Ahhhhhh and the hit's just keep on coming.   Good news, Ostrom has learned how to make coffee and how I like it (2 creams, 2 sugars) when I got to class this morning there was already a cup waiting for me at my desk. I think she knows I'm still&nbsp;pissed about the hickey thing. &nbsp;Now if I could just get her to stop being a ho things would be great.

      I am on the verge of losing another Airman to one of these fucking ridiculous tests. Grandpa, who is only called that because he's the oldest pipeliner at the ripe old age of 28, failed this morning. I'm so upset. Not with him, but with this whole process. "They" haven't decided if they are going to let him stay in our class, he might get washed back to another class so he can sit through this shit again.   This was a rough one. I usually score pretty high on the tests, and even I walked out of that room shaking because I was pretty sure I failed. I studied my ass off too. For the last two nights from 5 until about 12 I've done nothing but read the material, re read it, and then type notes on it. I fucking hate it. Is there something wrong with me? I&nbsp;left college with a 4.0 GPA, and being apart of and International Honors Society. I come here and I feel like a moron.&nbsp;Sorry, but I could really care less what the "levels of Force Application" are. I don't sleep anymore. I'm so damn frazzled all the time, I'm beginning to make myself physically ill.   Every morning when I drag (and yes we are still on days for about another week or two, fucking asses) my ass out of bed, I'm thinking do I really want to do this anymore? I mean, I love my shop and I love the people in my class, but man, I don't know how much more of this I can take. Is it worth it? I didn't come into this thinking it was going to be easy at all, but I thought it would at least make sense. Which nothing around here seems to.   I went to Cindy's graduation about a month and a half ago and everyone was hysterically crying. I can see why now, they were tears of joy! Anything to get out of here. I guess that's just the way that I have to look at it.   The really awesome thing about this course is the people that are in my class. I've had some pretty rough days with John's deployment and they've always been there to support me when I thought I was going to have a breakdown. When they fail or opt to leave because they can't handle it anymore, I feel like I've let them down. I didn't do enough. I fucking hate that feeling.  I guess that's why I get so upset. I cry with them, I try to help them as much as possible both academically and personally. Instructors have actually commented on how this class is more of a family than classmates and I like it that way.   Well I'm starting to get depressed again, so I should stop thinking about it. I'm going to type a study guide for Grandpa and hope it helps. Man where was my lucky quarter when I needed it?

      So I thought today was going to be uneventful, man was I wrong. I lost another Airman this morning to the dreaded "washout".&nbsp; For those that don't know what that is, it's just getting kicked out of the course. But only she didn't get kicked out she chose to leave. With the AF doing it's restructuring you have the option of leaving the course and getting out of the AF like you never even existed to the military.  Here we are in block 11 about to test tomorrow and move on to the next block, and she just quits. I'm kind of disappointed. I knew she was having a rough time being away from home, and missing her boyfriend, and this school is not easy at all. But she has accomplished so much, and we are so close to graduation. I'm really going to miss her. Damn.&nbsp;  Sara and I have had numerous conversations about everything. How fucked up the MTL's (military training leaders) treat them, being in a long distance relationship, being on Active Duty, etc. She's a great person, and I admire her for coming into the AF enlisted when she holds a degree in Political Science.  I guess it just wasn't for her, but she didn't get to see what&nbsp;it's really like, not here at Goodbuddy High School, where all they try to do is fuck you over.  I knew she was thinking about leaving, but she didn't seem that serious, it was more of a joking around thing. "Where do I sign up for that voluntarily get out list?" "How far is Mexico again?" Things like that, so this isn't a complete shock to me. I thought we, together, would stick it out and just get it over with. But I guess tomorrows test, and the upcoming briefings were wearing her nerves thin.  &nbsp;  In other news. I might have to stay on days a little while longer then was originally thought. I hate this shit. I want my night owl schedule back. It seems that the only consistency is inconsistency here. They don't have enough night instructors. How can you plan a class that's going to be on nights without enough instructors? I don' t get it.  But we may make the A shift come to B shift. If only this fucking Tech. Sgt. (E-6) would quit bitching about not being able to spend time with his kid if he were on nights. First off who brings their kids with them when they go to a school? I could understand if he were a single parent but he's not and his wife is here also. I went to 3 Navy schools, and not once did anyone have their family with them. Plus it's only for 3 weeks. Not the end of the world. I swear the AF is so soft sometimes.  But we may get lucky. I feel that it's only fair that we've been dealing with their hellish schedule for 3 weeks, they can deal with ours for 3 weeks. Once they see how great it is, they'll never want to return. We shall see.  &nbsp;  I talked to Carol today about the fire alarm incident. And you know what she told me. The only thing she was worried about when it went off was......." Get Fred!" (That's my hermit crab) Not I have to wake Liz up so she doesn't die, it was get Fred. I'm feeling loved today. LoL I guess I should stop making fun of her for the whole Army thing, maybe then she'll save me instead of Fred.  Well it's time to return to class. Have a great day!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I am going to tell you a story about my little Airman Basic Ostrom. She just turned 18 and is completely out of control. She reminds me of myself when I was a young Seaman (yes I was a seaman, LoL). She walks into class this morning and has her tie on. I'm thinking&nbsp;it's 110 degrees outside what is she doing with that tie on. She sits&nbsp;down next to me and I ask her about her weekend. She&nbsp;said that she&nbsp;had a&nbsp;"really" good time. She gives me this sly little smile and&nbsp; I wonder off to&nbsp;do my morning routine. Thinking nothing of&nbsp;all&nbsp;of this.  &nbsp;  After lunch and the&nbsp;bomb thing again.&nbsp;She walks in this&nbsp;time with no tie. Her neck is covered with hickeys!!!!!!!!! I mean it looked like someone tried to strangle&nbsp;this girl. I freaked out. She's telling me, I was good this weekend I promise. Bullshit.&nbsp;WTF is this shit. I can't believe that she would do something so tacky. I demanded to know whom the young man is that has attacked my Airman. She's says she's not going to tell me because, "I'll get mad". I think I&nbsp;kind of know who it is. So I told her that I will go up to him and ask him if was a certain Marine. She starts begging me not to ask him, because it wasn't him.  &nbsp;  I get the story about her "really good weekend" from her in about 2 seconds. It seems my little Airman was at the lake this past weekend with a certain Marine Fire Dog! Which is not the same guy that she's been "seeing". The guy that she's been seeing is at the same building which we are in, but in a different course.  &nbsp;  I don't know if this works, but I told her to put cold spoons on them, hopefully they will be gone soon.  &nbsp;  I swear I'm going to change my name to Capt. Chaos! These kids are killing me.........This is why they should never put me in charge of people.

      Well today started out good. John emailed me last night about midnight. It was good to hear from him and he seems like he's doing well. Ready to come home but doing well.  &nbsp;  I've been in class all morning and it's been really boring. I can't seem to stay awake anymore. We went downstairs and played with some of the training bombs. Yeah, can you tell how excited I am (that's sarcastic). I'm pretty pissed off that we waste so much time in this course. I mean if your going to make it 6 months long then give us 6 months of shit to do.&nbsp; Don't call it "self paced study" because the course has allotted too much time for one block, or let me go home! Sorry, that was a little bit of a rant there.  &nbsp;  So Rowland(one of the kids in my class) said that he is going to sue the Pope. He's claiming that the sun is a defected product because it causes cancer. Since he can't sue God, he's going to go for his right hand man. I don't think he can pull it off only because it would only apply to Catholics. But hey, I'm not going to argue with him.  &nbsp;  You see what I'm saying. This is supposed to be the one of the hardest schools in the AF and we sit around and talk about the stupidest shit, because 1. were so fucking burnt out 2. they leave us alone for hours at a time with nothing to do.  &nbsp;  I still have to clean the room and porch from this weekend. It's trashed and there's sticky shit all over the place. I can't stand it, but I'm too busy right now to do it, so it will just have to wait until later today.&nbsp;I should make Luke clean it, because it's his mess, but that could take weeks for him to do it.  &nbsp;  This morning at 5 fucking 30 when I got out of the shower, the steam made the smoke detector go off. Carol comes running out of her room, looking tired and ragged, with these big eyes, like WTF is going on. I'm standing there in my towel with a broom stick (I'm short) trying to turn the damn thing off. She reaches up hits the button and goes back to her room. Not saying a word, I think she was kind of pissed, but we will laugh about it later.  &nbsp;  Have a great day!

      I thought this would be a great way for my family and friends to keep track of me.&nbsp;  Last night was again another wild&nbsp;night out on the town&nbsp;in good 'ol&nbsp;San Angelo.&nbsp;I went out with about 20 people and we went to Ghrams. Ghrams&nbsp;has 6 bars all under one roof, and it always packed considering there is nothing to do in this town.&nbsp;Luke (my neighbor) was so wasted that he actually danced, which was all very interesting since he&nbsp;has no&nbsp;rhythm at&nbsp;ALL!&nbsp;I couldn't believe that he would let himself look that stupid, but it's all good, I&nbsp;have pictures and can bribe&nbsp;him now :)&nbsp;J/K.  My room is trashed and so is the porch. Beer cans are all over and I have to go out and clean all of that shit up before someone bitches about the mess.&nbsp;  I'm still trying to figure this whole site thing out so, be&nbsp;patient with me. I will try to get pictures and stuff posted here also.&nbsp;Gotta&nbsp;go.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;
