      ooo..i'm so sick? got 2 days MC..but of corz i'm not staying at hm..>. love life was kinda screwed....anyway..she was my first love ever..so impression and effect very big..can't blame..but i do feel abit cheated..btw..there's this 'him' she talks abt..dunno is me anot..maybe it's some other guy? she seems so undisturbed by my decision lor..really wonder if i'm really tt impt to her at all..was it juz physical intimacy or really love? for me..it's surely to be real love.. PC clinic ytd was quite birdly..so busy..rch hm 2300 le..didnt do anything although got test today..but luckily the test not tt hard..i think i can still get through..do i hv the courage to go into relationship again? afterall..first relationship hv a very huge impact and stuff..since the bad impact drags on for ard half a year..more effect..the glass rose i think i can juz dump away liao..she juz seems so hackcare...hmm..wat is she really thinking? so hard to noe..and she's lyk so lonely now..soon she may become a loner? her xin shi got nowhere else to go..mine neither..but....hmm..if i can overcome my love for her..and get out of her love life w/o getting out of her life totally..may be i still can be there for her to confide in and stuffs..tt is..if she's willing..coz most of the time it's juz willingness on my part..i'm willing to listen but she wun talk..*shrugs* yiwee kept telling me i can get over her..but can i really do it? tis isn't the first heart break for mousey(tt is if her heart even hurt one bit)..so i dun think it'll affect her tt much? i really kinda dun lyk her kind of attitude towards life..but..wat can i do? the oni i can do is to be there for her when she nd me as a kor..depends on she wan anot lor..

         feel so cheated..cant help but i juz feel so cheated..firstly, when mousey left me, i felt lyk she had been toying w me..all those pledge of love and foreva till eternity stuffs...rubbish..? our fate is in our own hands..blaming one's luck, life and stuffs are juz excuses~ now mousey starts to break all the appointments w me..feel cheated again..i oso dunno if i can trust her words anymore..if tis goes on..there'll be a day when her words will mean nth to me..of corz i dun wan tt to happen..but wat can i do? anyway, i dun think she'll hv another chance to break an appointment w me..nor to cheat me again..*sigh* ouch, itchy..i wore jeans ytd and i still gt biten lyk mad..so unfair..ok back to topic.. ytd could hv been a real great day i suppose, but..haiz..nevertheless..all the photo taking had been great fun..i noe tt if it had been mt, she wun hv wanted to go hm so early.. reasons for doubting tt i'm really tt impt to her: 1: she showed me attitude, explain as much as u lyk, but if i'm really tt impt, u wun show me attitude or at the very least, say sorry..it's been a really long time since i heard ur last sorry..believe anot, i was tempted to attitude u a number of times before, but evrytime i didnt..y? coz i told  myself tt u'r my loved and i shldnt be doing tt..... 2: she break appointments..ruining all the plans and all my hopes..crushed! not juz once....... 3: she shld at least hv the initiative to tell me tt she'll be msging less coz of saving sms..but no..leave me to guess all these while..and guess abt most things too..no care abt wat i might feel..is tis how u treat someone of great impt?       4: all ur behaviour put me thinking..am i really tt impt or juz tt coz i'm the oni one who treat u w care, love and concern all these times? and whether u'll juz forgt abt me in times to come when u hv frens and stuffs..yes, u said u wun..but, can i really trust ur words.......................?       sorry is juz a simple word, but ppl juz tend to NOT say it..for all due respect to evryone, 'sorry' means a lot to ppl..              now i juz dunno wat to do..wat to do w her..maybe it'll be good bye..maybe..........i dun wan tis to be ur bday gift..but...........wat shld i do?              if we're to be bro and sis..we'll most probably be quite closed..but tt'll juz hinder me fr gtting over u as a galfren..and might even make me fall for u all over again.....  i really dunno wat to...........................

         weird things happen to me again..^^" i met a old man down at bukit timah on my way to guitar lesson..he handed me his bag of empty drink cans and held onto my arm for support, asking me to help him get to the clinic in beauty world..since he already held onto my hand, i cant possibly push it away and so i did help him..and i sacrificed my lunch time coz of tt..end up hving to tolerate an hr more of hunger..w/o a single food since the beginning of the day..>.       thinking back into the past..as i grow older, strange things start to happen..first was the change of attitude of idiot, nxt i turn over a new leaf, nxt is mousey enter my life w alot of sweetness and bitterness, adding colors and flavors of all kind to my meaningless life, then i was hospitalised, turned out alright after 2 operations on my lungs, and i missed my prelims and 'o' lvl practical exams, then a break up which was due to irritation on her part (hmm...), soon after that we became couple again (read --> almost), then it drag on and now, she's still unsure of her feelings..so, is my life full of ups and downs or wat? man..this is some weird life i've got..^^"

          i'm struggling...w everything...my life, my studies, my friendships, my love life...i'm a failure in everything...i can juz go jump down e building...e ppl reading my blog will be so damn dead bored...cos they always see the same things...complain, nag, complain, nag...wat else can i do...too bad...cos e reason is simple...i simply hv no happy things in my life to say abt...maybe a short period last yr...tt was probably my happiest time in my life...but happy times r not meant to last...i'm sad n i'm very very sad...it seems as if i'm being suffocated...*gasp!* haiZ...my life's amess...need someone to help me clear it up...but how? everytime a 'eligible' guy runs along, i thought maybe he'll do, but i'll get scared...scared? of wat? lots of reasons...mostly becos of myself n my psychological barrier...haiZ...i've lost e key to my heart...i can't even open myself up...i'm juz a living zombie...everything i do goes wrong...ah, wateva...even if i strive for e best, do my best, e results r always e same...e lousiest i can ever get...juz to stamp on my self-esteem...huh! ppl always think i'm confident, but it's all juz an act...haiZ...
