      i fucking hate mushrooms. If you're ordering something at a restoraunt, the employees should obliged to tell you theres fucking mushrooms in the dish. On another note, im slightly drunk. i love family birthdays. my brother drove me home. and the moon tonight is intense.

      Today i woke up at 10:45 from a phone call from Gilda. That was intense. We made plan to meet for coffee. So we met and got our coffee. Truth is, she had earl grey tea, and i have cold coffee. Then we went to HMV because i needed to buy my dad a birthday present, considering its his birthday today.I got him Best of Phil Hartman (SNL) on DVD. Gilda bought Queen greatest hits for her moms birthday (tommorow). Say this guy Jay there...then we left, and met up with michelle. Then went to Barry square and hung out a bit with Gab and Glenkoe, them pro skater folk. Then i went home and gave my dad his DVD. He was happy. Soon we're going out for dinner, and my brother hasnt returned the movie he rented. Its due back in 20 minutes.  Gilda has a way of making me seem like an idiot in everyones eyes. hah.  since this summer is pretty much over, i'll write a list of my summer accomplishments: •being a fat kid •drinking far too much, too often •camera obscura, and everything in between •massively expanding my vinyl collection with glam rock •hating cindi lauper more than i can imagine •not being carded once •looking like shit everyday and not caring •skateboarding alot •getting free movie rentals. hah. •wife beater tan •going home (BC) and seeing all my friends (who i hadn't seen in 2 years) •breaking at least 3 toes at different times •managing not to get any action, whatsoever. •loving leroy (my acoustic guitar) more than i can imagine. •having the same nailpolish on since the starting of the summer,(its down to its last chip)        Gilda and Nadya are hot.

      today's playlist: •Natural Disasters - enon •Shave - enon •Disposable Parts - enon •In My Head - No Doubt i know, very eclectic.  I'm not in a very good mood. I started off my day late, had shower, did nothing. Picked up some pictures, fought with mother who was being very unreasonable, went to see michelle, walked her to Alena, saw nicky, she told me to suck it, looked at shoes, looked at michelles new shoes, stopped by the video store on the way back to see nicky, stared at the homeless woman with the beard across the street, went home, fought some more with mother, now im here. Can anyone tell me about menopause? i could use the info, it could explain alot.

      I'm new to this site. Got here from  urlLink Ben who is Hardy , after reading about his interesting trip. So its the drawing board for me. Today I had nothing to do, so i went to LCC with my mom (she works there), she showed me around, then we attempted to fix a lamp with tack. It didn't work, but we spent a good hour at it. Then i came home, made dinner (fried dumplings, rice, brussel sprouts), probably my favorite meal. Now im here, tommorow is death from above. I want to go, but im...broke. I need a job, so i think i'll be getting one if i can handle it (with schoolwork and whatnot) anyway. I need to buy some books.
