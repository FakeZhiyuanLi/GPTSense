      You Don't See Me  "I am the one  who turns out the lights  every night  And I stumble to my bed  gathering bruises on my shins  from invisible obstacles  that seem to collect around  my feet  an orgy of pain  in my aura  and then i lift my feet  and slip them under the sheets  where they cuddle together  and I am left  alone,  thoughts sore and solitary  upon my pillow.  and you don't see me  when the nights  bruise me  and dreams  don't mean much of anything at all  without your heart beat  warming to mine  you don't see me  when I close my eyes"  Very strange poem I found while looking at random things on 'bl a th er'.  Here is a link to blather:  urlLink bl a th er   Blather is just a site filled with anything and everything check it out.

      I am pretty excited, two days on the net and I already have a comment! Yay! Thanks Cristop.   Today we had a concert at school. The bands were generally crap, but I got to talk to some people. Not bad for the one dollar entry fee.   We (our family) are not on the top of the pile financially, but we survive and are doing well thanks to money management skills. It annoys me when people live in absolute poverty and are not helped by the government. Much more annoying are the....let's face it, westys who are horribly dirty, have 6 or 7 kids and just can't manage to even have a bath! If they bothered they could at least look presentable when they go out in public.   2 411 H4X0RZ 0(_)7 7/-/3R3, (_) R0(|  That was my brief interlude in hacker language which is pointless.  Anyway, I had a pretty bad day today but I'm feelin' fine for some reason. I almost refused to get up this morning, then the thought of someone at school inspired me. I have come to a strange conclusion for the 'meaning of life' lately also, I think that the meaning of life is other people. Because without other people, there would be no meaning in life. You have the top job, and the bottom job. You tell everyone what to do, then have to do it. The reason why I can be bothered doing anything is other people. That's just what I think though. Bye for now anyway. Cya tomorrow.  P.S. I am getting confused on what to call my posts as i usually run off on a random tangent.

      Maths irritates me. Will I ever need to know that (x-y)(x+y) = x2-y2? What's the point? I believe that life and the universe are much too complicated to be explained with math. Is there a formula for falling in love? It just happens and you can't resist it. My friend told me she was in love today, said she fell in love over the phone. I think it's possible.....love at first hearing. Maybe. Am I rambling? Oh Well, what can you do?   I was thinking about religion too. There is no way to explain the universe, no way that's 100% foolproof, so why try? Just accept it as it comes. The religions are trying to put a constraint on why things were created. I am personally an agnostic, which means that I believe in a 'greater force', some sort of god, but I'm not trying to find out what it is or why we are here.  Think about how big the universe is and how small the earth is. It is 99.9% probable that life other than humans exist. Why do we think we're so special.  Some advice to finish off: 1. Never ever dwell in the past, what good's it doing thinking about what has already passed? 2. Don't think to the future too much either, no more than a couple of weeks, because so many things are undecided and can change the course of events. If you plan and something happens you'll be dissapointed.  3. Love and be loved. Talk to everyone. Be friendly and generous.  If everyone followed these three things the world may be a better place.

      This is my first post ever. In this I will set out what the blog will be about. My blog will be about generally anything that happens to be in my mind at the time. I will comment on a lot of things; politics, life, philosophy, the severe lack of correct spelling on the internet. Anything that I think of. I am 15 years old and I live near Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. I may seem young to some, but I have some very set views which WILL be set forward whether people like it or not.

      Have you ever watched rage? It's some freaky stuff.   Anyway, now that I've thought of a title for my blog and mentioned it remotely, I can continue. New semester has started at school. Still pretty boring, I got A's for all my exams, that freaked me out. I attempted to talk to Laura and for once she actually acknowledged that I exist. That an improvement. I got another Tool CD too, they are almost the best band I know. (http://toolband.com) I've been listening to a lot of A Perfect Circle lately and they are a very good band. I'll have to get some more tabs so I can play some of their songs. I believe in music above all things, it is like oxygen to me.  I haven't given any advice for a while so..... - Don't want for anything you don't know you can have. The most likely thing is you'll get dissapointed.  - Believe in something, anything, and if you can it will keep you going. - If you want to do something just do it, don't worry about what other people will think or what they're going to say about you. Who cares? If they're that low you shouldn't bother talking to them anyway.  There, done my good deed for the day, attempted to improve people's lives. Job Done.

      Sorry everyone, haven't blogged for a while cause I've had exams. Exams went pretty well, boredom is boring......anyway.....  I'm going to write about MUSIC. Music is the essence of life. I would die without music. I play the guitar and have music everywhere I go. I bought a discman for the sole purpose of having music everywhere. People that aren't into music are normally strange (I'm not saying you all are....just most.). I like all kinds of music really, I like jazz, rock, metal, heavy rock, nu-metal, gothic rock, some hip-hop/rap. Almost anything except pop and classical. Some of my favourite bands are The John Butler Trio, Linkin Park, Rammstein, Tool, A Perfect Circle, Jet, Placebo, ....anyway, there's a lot a variety. In music, you can communicate exactly how you feel. Have you ever had that feeling when the words of a song describe how you feel better than you can? I want to sing sometimes and tell everyone. But that's just me.   I was talking to little year seven's todays because they are funny. The Year 7's hug me for no apparent reason. They also have SO much energy. I just can't be bothered keeping up. They are very funny people though. Got to go anyway, hope to see you soon.
