      George W. Bush and Dick Cheney once again this week tried to use "ties" between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda as justification for the war in Iraq. And respected bipartisan experts once again reported that they were wrong:  "We have no credible evidence that Iraq and Al Qaeda cooperated on any attacks against the United States, including the Sept 11, 2001 hijacking," says the staff report of the 9/11 commission, which was released this week. The commission's found that Osama bin Laden did try to reach out at one point but Saddam "never replied" to bin Laden's requests!   And if the President and Vice President don't want to take the word of the bipartisan 9/11 commission, we have more experts for them:   "The problem the administration has that the predicates it laid down for the war have not played out." Warren Rudman, former Republican Senator from New Hampshire, NY Times, June 17, 2004   "If you're asking if there's a direct link between 9/11 and Iraq, the answer is no." Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Hardball, 4/29/04  For a long list of how often the Bush administration has tried to make this claim - and been discredited each time - go the Center for American Progress Claim v Fact database.  On Terrorism: Remember How We Claimed We Were Succeeding? Never Mind. Remember the Bush administration report this spring that said the number of terrorist attacks in 2003 went down? Well, not quite. After Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) wrote Secretary of State Powell asking for an explanation, it turned out the numbers were wrong. In fact, according to USA Today, "both the number of incidents and the toll in victims increased sharply."  The State Department is now going back over the report to see just how this latest mistake could have happened. (We could make some suggestions!)   Here's our question: When the earlier, incorrect report was issued, Bush administration officials announced the lower numbers were proof of the success of their anti-terrorism policies. If the false claim that attacks went down meant Bush's policies were succeeding, what does it mean that the number of attacks went up? President Bush? Secretary Powell? Anyone? Don't all speak at once, guys.      On The Economy: The Administration's Own Numbers Contradict The Claims Of The Bush Campaign. This week the US Bureau of Labor Statistics confirmed what most of us already knew: middle class Americans are increasingly squeezed by rising prices for necessities such as health care, education and transportation -- while wages are not keeping up.   The report on real average wages released this week shows that weekly earnings have actually decreased in the last year.(Real average wages are calculated by comparing changes in average hourly earnings and the Consumer Price Index.)  Meanwhile, the out-of-touch Bush administration maintains that everything is going great. Or as Secretary of Commerce Don Evans said: "More Americans are going on spending sprees at shopping malls as more people are finding well-paying jobs."  Sure we're on "spending sprees" for expensive items like health care, college tuition and gas for the car!      Title IX On Trial Again.   Title IX, the landmark provision in federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education programs is on trial again -- and this time, it's up to the Supreme Court.   Roderick Jackson, who coached girls' basketball at an Alabama high school, was fired for complaining that the girls' team was forced to use substandard facilities and equipment and received less money and support than the boys. Lower courts rejected Jackson's suit, saying that Title IX does not allow any specific right to sue over alleged retaliation.   Our friends at the National Women's Law Center (NWLC) are arguing for Jackson, pointing out that the courts have held anti-discriminatory laws allow suits over alleged retaliation while the lower court ruling "threatens to undermine a fundamental protection against sex discrimination in all federally funded educational settings."  We agree. Meanwhile, three cheers for Coach Jackson and the good guys who fight to uphold Title IX and give girls an equal chance!    Extra, Extra:    Week In Review Agrees With G.W. Bush! Former President Bill Clinton and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton were honored this week as their official portraits were unveiled at the White House. WVC National Chair Ann Lewis was among the Clinton appointees, staff and friends who attended.   In his remarks President Bush said that former President Clinton "showed a deep and far ranging knowledge of public policy, a great compassion for people, and the forward looking spirit the American people like in a President." Of Senator Clinton, he said:  "New York politics is serious business," the President said. "It takes an extraordinary person to campaign and win the United States Senate. She has proven herself more than equal to the challenge."   When he's right, he's right.    Democrats Taking the Lead    John Kerry Has A Plan To Expand The Middle Class. Why is the middle class squeezed? Working parents know what it's like to juggle budgets with the rising cost of health care, gas for the car -- and child care.  Now George W. Bush is trying to make things worse. His budget would cut programs that now provide after-school opportunities for 500,000 children -- increasing the number of children under 13 who are on their own until their parents return from work .  John Kerry understands what a difference child care can make for safe and healthy children.  "All across this country there are families who would like to enroll their kids in afterschool and child care programs, but they can't because budgets are tight," Kerry said. "And for this administration in Washington, afterschool is just an after-thought. They don't understand how important it is to working parents. Well, we do. We know how much afterschool and child care matter for working families, and that's why I have a plan that will help families do the right thing for their kids."  John Kerry will increase the Childcare Tax Credit to cover $5,000 of expenses and make it available for moderate-income families and stay-at-home parents. And in the Kerry Administration, a couple earning $60,000 with two children will get an additional $800 tax cut.  John Kerry knows that a stronger America begins at home -- and that means a strong middle class. This week, he continues to lay out his plan to stop squeezing and start expanding our middle class.   Congresswomen Speak Out.    Democratic Congresswomen Carolyn Maloney (NY), Juanita Millender-McDonald (CA), Diane Watson,(CA) Jan Schakowsky,(IL) Lynn Woolsey, (CA)and Marcy Kaptur (OH) spoke out this week for John Kerry's plans to improve benefits for hard pressed middle class families, including increased child care tax credits and more support for after school care. These are the concerns that are on the minds of our constituents the congresswomen said, speaking of single mothers and working families juggling several low paid jobs to get by.  "John Kerry has a plan," said Congresswoman Millender-McDonald. "He's going to increase the child care taxes for the middle class. He's going to increase Pell Grants for our children going off to college [and] he's going to afford more housing for those who are in urban areas...John Kerry wants to build a stronger America in bringing forth all Americans to the table and not leaving anyone behind."   House Democrats Fight For American Jobs.    Congressional Democrats today announced a comprehensive plan to create new jobs and help the millions of unemployed Americans still looking for work. The American Jobs Plan proposes repealing $125 billion in current tax breaks that help ship jobs overseas, replacing them instead with two new tax incentives targeted to companies, both large and small, that create new jobs in the United States. Under the new jobs plan, savings from ending tax loopholes would be invested in job training, education, and research and development.  "To stop the loss of American jobs, we must close these tax loopholes, invest in our people, and create the new technologies that will lead to tomorrow's jobs, said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. For more information about the The American Jobs Plan" agenda, click here.    Quotes of the Week   "Banned biological and chemical weapons: none yet found. Percentage of Iraqis who view American-led forces as liberators: 2 according to a poll commissioned last month by the Coalition Provisional Authority. Number of possible Al Qaeda associates known to have been in Iraq in recent years: one, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whose links to the terrorist group and Mr. Hussein's government remain sketchy."   - New York Times, June 17, 2004   The State Department released a memo saying terrorism has gone down. It turns out, the only reason they came up with that information is because of a mathematical error. A mathematical error, isn't that how Bush became president?   - Dave Letterman, June 14, 2004

      Yesterday the end of work was so very slow.  Finally got out of work and went home.  I called this guy that I have been talking to alot lately and we decided to go grab a bite to eat.  We went to Chipotle!  Yummy yummy in my tummy!  It was so great.  Afterward he suggested that we walk over to GAP.  What do you know...they had a sale going!  WHEW HEW!  Time to get some clothes.  Bad me!  Oh well I only bought two pair of shorts so all was good.  They were cute shorts I had to get them!  After the brief shopping spree we went to sit on the bench in front of the ice cream shop.  It was nice.  I like spending time with him.  At this time it was almost 10 so we decided that we both needed to get home so hugs and kisses and we went home.  YEAY!  That is all for now.  Buh Bye!

      Okay so I have a friend that keeps this updated very often.  Alot more often than I would ever be able to.  I guess I wouldn't know where to start.    I did make it to the Andersonville MidSommer Festival this weekend as well as the Chicago Blues Festival.  Was a great weekend to get out on the town and see the sights and enjoy everything.  So anywho...I wrote something (me)

      I had a week vacation for the holiday week.  I decided that I would go "home" to visit family.  Hum, yeah really dont know why I did that.  It was so boring!  The family seems to be going in totally different directions.  It is really odd since we have always been such a close family.  My little sister is going through a divorce with a custody battle and not sure what she is doing cause she already has another guy that she is seeing.  She asked me what I thought about it.  I was forward and told her that I didn't think that she should be envolved with another person until her divorce was final.  I also told her that I am not one to judge people and that if she is happy that is great, but also mentioned that there may be unforeseen consequences later down the road.  My mom who has been divored for several years now is also seeing someone.  She wanted me to meet him and his three kids!  My sister and I went to his house for a fish fry.  My mom knows that my sister and I DO NOT like fish.  We arrived and the apartment was as hot as one summer day in August with eighty percent humidity and also smelling of nasty fish!  I asked mom why she didnt open some windows.  She said that the air conditioning was on.  Well it was a hell of a lot cooler outside but okay.  She introduced me to this guy, "this is my son".  Wow!  Thanks!  They all nodded and went back to frying their fish!  I was so ready to come back to Chicago!  Mom then asked me if I wanted to go outside and see her new Jeep that her "man" bought her.  I agreed since it was so hot inside.  It was a nice two thousand four gray Jeep.  We didnt spend much time on going over the details of the Jeep.  On the way back inside I asked if she would be mad if I were to go get something to eat from somewhere other than eating the fish.  She said it was fine and I wanted to make sure that her "man" wouldn't be upset either, since it was his place and did open the door to us.  Anyway that was all over and done with.  I did get to spend time with all of my friends.  Nice to see everyone but thank GOD I am back!
