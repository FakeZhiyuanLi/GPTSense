      Hey yall...today has been sooo long! I went to the movies w/ Caitlin to see Mean Girls. It was really good..We should have a burn book~!LoL....no.Charlie was gunna go but he woke up late and couldnt make it on time..At church today Gracie was singing(shes a baby) But yeah other than that it was really boring. We had team pictures today. Well...I G2G. I guess I'll ttyl. I'm going to Canada in 5 days baby~!                  Susan Here are some new songs that I like: Basket Case Do you have the time To listen to me whine About nothing and everything all at once I am one of those Melodramatic fools Neurotic to the bone no doubt about it  Sometimes I give myself the creeps Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up I think I'm cracking up Am I just paranoid Or am I just stoned  I went to a shrink To analyze my dreams She says it's lack of sex That's bringing me down I went to a whore He said my life's a bore So quit my whining cause It's bringing her down  Sometimes I give myself the creeps Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up I think I'm cracking up Am I just paranoid Or am I just stoned  Grasping to control So I better hold on  Sometimes I give myself the creeps Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me It all keeps adding up I think I'm cracking up Am I just paranoid Or am I just stoned Hanging out behind the club on the weekends Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour I rememeber that it's the first time that I saw her there  She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing I'm kinda nervous, cause I think all her friends hate me She's the one, she'll always be there She took my hand and I made it I swear  Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know She's so cool, better sneak in through her window Everything's better when she's around Can't wait until her parents go out of town I fell in love with the girl at the rock show  When we said we were gonna move to Vegas I remember the look her mother gave us 17 without a purpose or direction We don't owe anyone a fucking explaination  I fell in love with the girl at the rock show She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know She's so cool, better sneak in through her window Everything's better when she's around Can't wait until her parents go out of town I fell in love with the girl at the rock show  Black and white picture of her on my wall I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance Because she kept me waiting  I fell in love with the girl at the rock show She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know She's so cool, better sneak in through her window Everything's better when she's around Can't wait until her parents go out of town I fell in love with the girl at the rock show "Swing Swing"   Days swiftly come and go. I'm dreaming of her She's seeing other guys Emotions they stir The sun is gone. The nights are long And I am left while the tears fall.  Did you think that I would cry, on the phone? Do you know what it feels like, being alone? I'll find someone new  Swing, Swing, Swing from the tangles of My heart is crushed by a former love Can you help me find a way To carry on again.  Wish cast into the sky I'm moving on Sweet beginnings do arise She knows I was wrong The notes are old, They bend, they fold and so do I to a new love.  Bury me (you thought your problems were gone) Carry me (away. away, away...)

      Hey yall~Today me and Christianna had a game. It was the worst game we had ever played. Ashley C. (our pitcher) was gettin all mad at me cuz I couldnt catch the ball. Well note to self Ashley...*you cant catch the ball if it is 50 feet in the air.* and she got mad at me cuz I wouldnt throw the ball to her when the runner was going home note to self again *if the runner has already steped on the plate you dont throw the ball and make another error* OMGAW!!! Last night I was on the phone w/ Charlie until 12:30 am.. Wow!! We talked forever..I called Caitlin on 3-way and me and her talked to Charlie..They have a lot in common. Me,Caitlin,Charlie, and his friend Jordan are all going to the moviez on Sunday~!Well...I G2G~! I write back later~! I luv you babe                  Susan

      Hey~ Today wasnt all that interesting. We had a sub. bcuz Mrs. Sam is in NASA w/ Scott and Nick...aww Nick. I dont know what to do with him. Anyways...Christian got sent to the office bcuz he told me to shut the hell up. The only reason he said that was bcuz he thought that I had called him a hermaphradite. But I didnt cuz I was talking to the worms..or about the worms. Anywayz...life is so annoying these days..dont yeh agree? Well..Im sitting in the computer lab w/ Ashley E. At lunch today Mrs.Burke "needed to talk to me" about Christian..but we got it figured out cuz I told her that I talk to myself all the time and people probablly thought I was talkin about Christian cuz every1 else was. OMGAW!!! There is this person...lets just call him/her Harry. Now, Harry needs to stay outta me and Ashley E. talking moments. When this Harry figure comes up to us all Harry ever talks about is his/her cousin. Well it is really starting to bug me..and if "Harry" is reading this...you know who you are..please stop..it is annoying. Well...thats about it.TaTa for now. Luv yeh bunchies~!
