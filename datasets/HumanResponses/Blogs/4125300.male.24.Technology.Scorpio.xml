      Life has felt so surreal lately. Work just seems to pass by, and the days are just gliding by. They say "life is short", and I think I finally understand what they mean. The only times I feel reality is during physical activity. Perhaps I'm on the verge of a new spiritual consciousness. My instincts tell me that I'd have to sacrifice things very dear to me to achieve it. I believe that if one is heavily concerned with the sacrifices, then they aren't ready for the ideology. Such changes should not be choices, but rather almost innate decisions. Change comes from within.  Speaking of physical activity, I just bought a pretty nice (older) racing bike for $75.   Very excited!  Apparently the person who sold it used to race it during college, but now rides something newer. The bike I've been riding is quite old, poorly maintained, and weighs a ton. Somehow it got to the U.S. from China somehow, or at least I assume due to the mandarin script on it. Anyway, the new bike is well maintained, has a lot of racing features, and is much lighter. Can't wait to get the bike on the trail!  Had some serious conversations with CW lately. They seem to end up with us laughing. This is a really good sign. If we can take conversations that have the potential for emotional intensity and reduce them to humor, then we will not hesitate to talk about the things that bother us. Every issue is easier to resolve if you have a smile on your face!

      Met a good old friend GN at the Coventry experience.  He has recently broken up with his girlfriend of a millenium, finished his B.S., and quit smoking.   Needless to say he is a fucking mess.    Regardless, I was giving him a really hard time about some things.   Sometimes I think he is a very difficult person to be friends with.  In going on 7 years of friendship, 4 years living as roommates, I can count the number of times we have done something social that I suggested on one hand, probably less.   The most recent incarnation of his unwillingness was a Biscuits show in Philly, that I thought we should go to.  His response was "get my other friend to go, then I'll come".    I was pretty pissed.  I suppose that this is just his way of saying that I didn't want to go, but it was pretty tactless to say it this way.    I was giving him some grief for this,  and I feel some regret for doing so.  I know that I needed to talk to him about this, but I don't think that this was the right time, nor place.  As mentioned previously, he is probably more then a little emotionally unstable right now, and Phish breaking up certainly doesn't help.  Sometimes frienship is knowing when you need to fall on the grenade, so to speak.   That being said I don't feel too bad.  I needed to get it off of my chest, and talking about it is the only way I'll be able to continue being friends with him.   Anyway life is pretty decent here.  Spending some much desired time with CW, after 2 weekends of being away.  Think I'm going to be buying a couch some time soon.

      This entry is from CW's Uncle's house. So the Dr.'s office called today, said: "Hi, this is dr. such and such's office, your result from the STD test are in.  I'd like to ask you make an appt."   My heart just skipped a beat, then practically exploded, before dropping into the deepest bowels of hell.  "Ooops she said, I mean we got your blood test, and you are negative."  THANK GOD!  I almost pooped myself.  "But we didn't get the urine test done successfully, could you come back in and give another sample?"   Well sure I answered.  Ended up going after work today.  Whoa, gotta end this entry quick.  CW's Uncle is returning, early, and I need to get the hell out of here.  Oh this feels SO much like highschool :)..

      CW is housesitting, so I spent the night at her Uncle's house.  She made a really excellent dinner, which I devoured.  We sat down to watch the Cowboy Bebob movie, which is a pretty good anime flick.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stay awake to save my life.  Felt kind of bad about that, but it was a lethal combination of food coma and exhaustion, not a lack of interest in the movie that put me to sleep.  Oh well, I think she understands this.  CW made a comment the other day on how her friends had been breaking up with long term significant others recently, for the express purpose of seeing who else is out there.  The comment started me thinking about my progression through girlfriends, and the reasons the relationships have ended.  At first, I thought that my last two serious relationships have been very good experiences.  The lessons learned were many, and hopefully will serve me well.   However this morning I've come to a completely different conclusion.  The choice of people I've dated previously are precisely the people I couldn't sustain a long term relationship with.  The starving artist, and the P.H.D. student 8 years my elder, are great examples of  that  which could never work out.  So have I had  any  relevant experience?  The wanderlust idea struck a chord in me.  Will CW be motivated by a similar desire to see who else is out there?  Will I?  I think it is futile to worry about those things.  The future is unpredictable; enjoying the present is much more important.

      Rode my bike to work today. Feel like shit, but am pretty sure that exercise and eating well are probably the best ways to get myself back on my feet. First thing, some stats: Miles driven: 1304.7 Pat's Cheesesteaks Eaten: 5 Bottles Consumed:  2 (1 Tanqueray, 1 Gray Goose) Beers Consumed: 10 Dollars spent Hitchhiking: $50 Miles avoided walking by hitchhiking: 24 Lbs Ham consumed: 2 Lbs Turkey consumed: 2 Red Bull Pounded: 8 Water drank, (in gallons): 3 Liters, Tonic mixed:  2 Tolls Paid:  ???  What a great trip.  Worth feeling like shit right now for.   Thank god for coffee.  Some thoughts: First things first: This was a disaster for Phish fans. Probably 40k people got turned away from the show. I'm not sure who is to blame for this, but rain should not be able to make festival so difficult. Reports of people waiting 18 hours, sleeping in their cars, then being told to turn around and go home? Good grief. Decision should have been made long before. Oh yea, some gravel or cedar chips could have make a huge difference. Using tractors? Not sure if this was the best decision. I mean if cars are going to destroy the turf, imagine those thick tractor treads wreaking havoc.  I mean all of these cars DO need to get out...  Driving down I91N was a little spooky.  Thousands of cars abandoned on the side of the road, and hardly a person around.  Was traveling at 105 mph in my little mazda, and almost got pulled over.  Seriously very lucky.  Thank god for the other schmo that got pulled over before me!  Anyway, IG and I drove up, planning to make it just in time for the first set. We were turned around and told to go home twice, but decided to simply try to walk it. Thankfully we were picked up by some local yokels, who for the  bargain  price of $10 each, would drive us within a few miles of the show. Being in the middle of nowhere, being driven to god-knows-where, by two locals -- felt like I was in Deliverance or something. Anyway, after what felt like an eternity, we were dropped off closer to the show. A few minutes of walking, and we were ready for another ride.  Amazingly  enough, another ride was available. Could hear Runaway Jim in the distance. After setting up our tent, having a few drinks, we started the walk to the venue. Didn't get in until last song of first set... I didn't care. We had made it in!   Bought a green coventry phish long sleeve shirt.  It was getting cold, and I figured that I should have some warmer clothes.   Met three Canadian girls on the way out.  They were pretty friendly.  I couldn't stop myself laughing whenever they said "eh" or "aboot".  HEHEHEH!  Also laughed to  myself when I said called Canada Canadia...  LOL.   Anyway, lost them before the second set.   Went to get another beer, and then headed into the show.  Second set was pretty good.  No Complaints.    Third set was fun,  especially when I called two of the songs.  IG started calling me "The Oracle".  Highlights was the stash > free  Sunday woke up, and started drinking soon after.  Met up with GN, and tossed the frisbee around a bit.  Was pretty wasted by the time we decided to head down to see the first set. Show was pretty good.  Loved the Down With Disease, and the Wading in the Velvet Sea.  I admit I even shed a few tears.   Called the Story of the Ghost, and that there would be no rain. Was a little ticked off at the Bruno and Dickie crap.  Come on guys, this is your last set.   Play the great stuff that got you here, not gimmicky joke crap.  Who out there would rather here this then say.. Divided Sky, or 2001, Freebird?  Not a soul!   Hippy Chicks No Longer Hot?  Yes, I believe this is true.  I used to think the girls at these concerts were so hot.  Wearing baggy shorts and backless shirts, totally used to be my thing.  At Coventry I didn't get this feeling, not even in the least.   I used to dream an escapist fantasy, where some crazy female spirit visits me, and leaves as quickly as she came.   However I've found a something much more grounded, and much more fulfilling in CW.  The experience that is devoid of emotional connection no longer represents my fantasies, and hardly seems to resonate at all.   Trip Quotes:  "Waiting for the day that I can finally say This has all been wonderful and now I'm on my way" -Trey Anastasio "I took a moment from my day Wrapped it up in things you say Mailed it off to your address Youâ€™ll get it pretty soon unless  The packaging begins to break And all the points I tried to make Are tossed with thoughts into a bin Time leaks out my life leaks in  You wonâ€™t find moments in a box And someone else will set your clocks I took a moment from my day Wrapped it up in things you say And mailed it off to you" -Page  "I can't be held responsible for my all of my actions" "Donkey" "Pigfucker" "One word for those that turned back-- Quitters"

      Leaving for Coventry tonight, and have lots to do until then.  Haven't packed at all, and need to pick up a cooler of some sorts for food, alcohol, water, etc.   Really getting quite excited!  Sounds like Phish is handling this well.  Reading reports of lots of extra tickets being sold at the gate, and this will be a good thing(tm), so crazy w00ks don't crash the gates.  Pity the guy that bought the ticket for $400 off of ebay however.   Stole my roommies Led Zeppelin CD.  Not exactly morning music, but I'm not complaining.  Realize rock has a rich history, and exploring it will require some time.   Also been listening to D.J. Icey(trance), Dubtribe(dub),  Norah Jones(blues),  GD, and Brothers Past.  Oh yea, and Phish I suppose.   Reading Diamond Age by Neil Stephenson.  Don't think I like it nearly as much as I did Cryptnomicon or Snow Crash.  Both of those were very clever -- not in the typical novelistic sense, but rather in observational and character humor.   Diamond Age has very little of this edgy humor, but still is enjoyable to read, and a page turner.

      Ok, so not lost. Maybe "Given Away" is more accurate. I did give WC the name of my blog. Hope you enjoy it hon! Apparently she will likely be linking to it soon, so I'd like to extend a warm welcome to all of her friends, friends of friends, relatives, and others that may wander on in.  Hopefully this won't change the nature of my writing, nor my relationship with my blog.  I was thinking about talking about what my blog name means to me, but I think I'd rather let people figure that one out. Those who know me intimately, may have a shot, a long shot, of figuring it all out.

      Really tired today.  Coffee, didn't help.  Snack, no dice.  Riding bike to work?  Thusfar no help. Maybe lunch will help me wake up.  This weekend heading to Coventry VT to see Phish's last festival.  Should be a lotta fun.  Have been listening to Phish lately quite a bit.   Have a lot of mixed feelings about them and the music.  I suppose ultimately I'd rather just sell the tixs.  They have been going for about $400+ on ebay.  I think I'd trade my weekend for $800.   However good friend IG is flying up, and I am very excited to spend a few days hanging with him.   That itself might be worth the $800.  IG is one of those guys that if I lived closer to, I know we would be absolute best friends.  He is a great guy, and we enjoy similar music/movies/lifestyle, not to mention share the same rather ironic and offbeat sense of humor.  He has chosen to live in Cleveland, but I sometimes wonder about the basis of that decision.  Speaking to him about the subject, he seemed to just be very adverse to paying rent.  Living in Cleveland, he can stay with his parents, until he can afford to buy a house.  I suppose that decision makes sense from a financial standpoint, but I question if it good for him socially or emotionally.  That being said, I don't worry too much about it.  I suspect he has reasons that span the financial ones, and I suspect that those ones are his better reasons.   Things are going very well with CW.  We have these pseudo-arguments about abstract ideas-- neither of us gets angry, but we both are very animated as we talk.  Interuptions are often and quick -- typically it is difficult for either of us to get a full thought out.  In a primal sense, I enjoy these discussions.  I often think that I may have some need of conflict in my life, and in my relationships.  I think CW may be the same way.  Amazing on how compatible we seem to be.   *Disclaimer* we have only been dating for two and a half months, so yes we still are in the honeymoon stage.  I think the important part is knowing when we are in a pseudo-argument, and when the argument is no longer pseudo.  Back to work...

      Writing after Dr. appointment.  My prayers were answered.  All I needed to do was get a blood test.   Should be getting results in a week or so.  Not too worried.  Little bit apprehensive I suppose.  Listening to NPR today, I noted lots of talk about Sudan.  For those that may not know, something similar in nature to the Holocaust has been and continues to occur there.  Apparently a government backed arab militia is going around killing, raping and generally destroying a certain ethnicity.  First response is horror.   I genuinely don't understand how people can be so separated from their humanity as to do such a thing.  Second response is horror -- this time over the World's inability to do anything about it.  In recent history Western nations (i.e. Europe, U.S.),  seemed to be the only nations with the military strength and moral credibility to do such a thing.  However through ill advised war against Iraq has robbed the U.S. and parts of Europe of their ethical high ground.  A military prescence in another mostly muslim nation would look very bad about now.    A quick note on the reporting of the Sudan issue.  The reporter called himself NPR's Africa correspondant.  One reporter for an entire continent seems insufficient if you ask me.  Note to self:  donate to NPR soon.

      Going to the doctor today. Not looking forward to it. I'm almost never in favor of seeing health proffesionals. Seems like often the cure is worse then the disease. When calling them today, I didn't expect them to have open appointments so soon. However I'm glad they do. The only thing worse then going to the doctor is dreading going. Also going to be tested for STDs. I have no reason to believe that I am infected, but its better to be safe then sorry. Heard horror stories about the actual test. Hopefully they've pioneered some less intrusive means of doing so. I'm not very optimistic on this one.  Also may talk about leg injury.  Maybe get recomendations for orthopedist.

      Still getting used to.. not being in florida.  Sitting here testing one of my companies products.  Don't think I'm quite ready to be back yet.  Oh well, another vacation this weekend (Coventry here I come).  My relationship with CW is transitioning to something serious.  While we are still joking to each other, and having a good time, the seed of a serious relationship has been sowed.   With care and attention I think it will flourish.   I haven't written much in the political realm yet, and I'm thinking today might be the day.  Listening to NPR today I was struck by the comments about Iraqi Cleric Al-Sadr.  Apparently he has sworn to fight against the U.S. occupation to the death.  I initially asked myself why he would fight an force that is ultimately trying to help the Iraqi people.  Quickly that thought was replaced by another question.  Are we really helping the Iraqi people? What reason do they have to trust us?   Do we have their best interests at heart?  Call me cynical, but I doubt it.   I don't trust this administration, and I am quickly losing all trust in the government.  I think there is just too much money, and too many conflicts of interest to withstand any kind of ideological explanation.  The Iraqis have simply changed which leader/group they are sacrificing self-determination for.  Perhaps we are more benign then Saddam, but if the Abu Gharib prison scandal, and the helicopter gunships currently strafing Iraqi civilian areas are any indication,  Americans  need to rethink our purpose in Iraq, and what we expect to achieve.  I love norah jones' voice.   Smoky, sexy, and evocative.  I don't think I've liked such vocal driven music in  years  .

      Back at work.  Returned from the Miami trip last night. CW picked us up at the airport. Was very happy to see her. Still too tired from the trip to function. Hopefully coffee will save me. Oh yea coffee, and Norah Jones too...  Saturday was the big crescendo of the giant party that was to be our Miami trip. We drove to South Beach in pouring rain, and I think our spirits began to depress. A second day of rain on this trip? Ick. Things did seem to clear up a little bit after we got to S. Beach. Still looked too threatening to hit the beach. Went shopping instead. Bought a new watch, a pretty good looking shirt, and a couple of trinkets for CW. Spent far too much money, but ya can't take it with you I suppose. Went to a used CD store afterwards. Bought 5 or 6 cds, including Norah Jones, GD, the 8th Mile soundtrack, and some assorted electronica cds. A good mix, I think.  South Beach dining is not all that -- or at least we didn't know where to go. I got lasagna, which tasted like chef boyardee. KA picked up some seafood pasta, which had the same nasty sauce. Most expensive shitty food I've ever eaten. Service was pretty terrible too. They were supposed to give us bread -- to dip into olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Of course they didn't, or at least until half way through our meal. Oh yea, and tip of course was included on the bill. What a sham. We resolved to eat at a chain restaurant for dinner.  Returned to our rooms, took a nap, then started to get ready for the festivities. We went to a club called the crobar. Very nice, rather expensive club. Thankfully had free passes to get in. First d.j. was terrible. I can't believe a club this nice would have such a horrible resident dj! Madonna remixes? Seriously go the fuck home! Second d.j. was significantly better which imho put him in the mediocre category. His beat was hypnotic, but note the singular case. He had only one beat. Literally. Granted that gets a bit monotonous. I wasn't going to let it get in the way of having a great night. Danced like I was on E for many hours. Drank tons, and used red bull to moderate the negative effects. Left around 4, and headed back to the hotel. Waded a bit in the Atlantic, and had a really deep conversation with AD. AD is a great guy, I'm glad I met him. We defn could become good friends.  I think we share a very common history, especially in terms of exes. I hope CW and I can hang out with AD and his girlfriend.  Sunday was gorgeous.  Hot, sunny, and humid.  Perfect baking weather.  Went for a long walk on the beach, and tried to get a tan.  Florida sun is nice and powerful.  AD and KA got bored fairly quickly though, so we left after an hour or so.  I kind of wish we would have baked a little bit longer.  Bummer going to Miami and not getting much of a tan.   Had lunch at a Japanese/Chinese buffet.  Very tasty, and ate about 3 meals worth of food.  Green Tea ice cream for desert.  Pretty reasonable ($30 for three of us).  Headed back to AD's place to pack, then headed to the airport.   Flight on TED was uneventful, besides the fact that we  somehow  got economy plus tickets.  Very comfortable.   Talked with KA the entire ride, discussing life and such.  KA is a few years older then me, but still manages to live at home with his parents.  I think this has some deleterious effects on his personality and lifestyle.  I told him so on the flight back, and at times I don't think he responded well.  Granted, I was  very  blunt.  Its hard for me to be...diplomatic.  Regardless, I eventually tempered my opinionated attitude with a more apologetic and friendly one, and this seemed to calm him down.  KA is a damn good guy, and he is one of my closer friends.   I need to remember not to criticize him too much.  I think I have a tendency to criticize people too much.  Acknowledging it is the first step to dealing with it right?  Anyway, I don't think any permanent harm was done -- he im'ed me this morning.  I know he had a great time in Miami too.  Was damn near ecstatic to spend time with CW.  Felt like I hadn't seen her for months.  Think I'm going to be leaving work soon.   Maybe  more later.

      Another day finished in Miami.  Weather was looking shitty in the morning.. some thunderstorms and raining.  KA and I went for a run anyway.  By the time we were done with our run, it had pretty much cleared up.  After a shower, we headed to get some food and spend some quality time on the beach.  Enjoyed my time on the beach and in the ocean immensely.  No waves, but c'est la vie.   AD got out of work, and met us at the beach around 5:45.  We had dinner at a tasty little restaraunt about a block from the beach, then headed to AD's place to rest and recover before the revelry at night.   Later went to a club in Ft. Lauderdale called the Voodoo Lounge.   Was a lot of fun.    Dj. Cato Calin was spinning.  I was pretty impressed.  He is no Oakenfold, but for a random night in a club, he was way better then expected.  KA had an absolute blast, and I was happy to hear it.  Stayed in club til some time after 3 -- way past my bedtime,  got some tasty empanadas at a small grille about a block away.   Any comments on South Beach would not be complete without a comment on all of the beautiful women around her.  So thats it.  I wouldn't trade CW for any of them, but they are still fun to watch.   Liked D.J., didn't like prices.  $5 for bottled water!  Didn't like security either.  Speaking of people I didn't like...  Some guy sitting down on a bench... just randomly made eye contact with him, and his reponse is something like "want some of this? Come on!" -- ooohh you big testosterone filled he-man.  I'm so  scared  of you, I'm going to  ignore  you, and walk away.  Idiot.   Oh yea, the guy who talked shit to us while I was running.  If you are going to talk shit to someone that is running, you should at least have the common courtesy to let that runner  run your ass into the ground,  ok?  I honestly would have put in 10 miles just to see you dying, out of breath and cramped up.  Yes, I'm a bit competitive ;)  Tonite should be the real deal.  South beach.

       First day in Florida finished...   I had a great time.  While the weather was rainy for a good part of the day, at least it kept us cool :), and it made for a very nice night.   The plane flight was pleasant.  Flew a morning flight into Ft. Lauderdale.  I slept through the vast vast majority of it.  Descent was through storm clouds, and quite a bit of turbulence.Landed, then took a shuttle bus to the Thrifty car rental.  Got our convertible -- a red Chrysler Sebring.  Pretty nice I must say.  Too bad I can't drive it :(.  Humourous anecdote on the shuttle bus.  Apparently United is going with the name "Ted" for some of its flights.  The flight stewards kept commenting "thanks for riding on Ted"... haha... So on the shuttle bus KA and I started joking... "I sure enjoyed my ride on Ted"/"but, my ride on Ted was a little bumpy"/ "yea especially when we were going down".  We were having a great time, like the 12 year olds we really are,  when some women said "there are lots of children on this bus"... blah blah.. I responded saying that she needed to chill with the puritanism.   She responded that she wasn't some kind of conservative, but she didn't think sex should be discussed like it was "nothing".  I responded that we were talking about our flight and that she should get her mind out of the gutter.  hahhahahahaha  Tried to find the beach after we landed, but were given poor directions.  We drove pretty dang far before turning around.  Stopped in Hollywood and got food at a cuban restaurant.  Very tasty!  Sangria was fabulous!  Mmm... fried steak!... Then had desert at a small russian place.  Chocoloate mousse was to die for.  Regardless detours didn't bother me much, as I simply enjoyed looking at the buildings.   Around here they are really neat looking and different.  I think they are Art-Deco.  Love all of the pastels, shades of purple orange and yellow.  Very cool, very interesting.  Everything is so so green!  I thought Virginia was green.   City of Ft. Lauderdale is clean, nice and so close to the ocean, its great.  Ate dinner at Dan Marino's Bar and Grill.  Had some pretty decent drinks, and a very good salad.  A bit expensive, but I'm not worried!  I'm on vacation!  Started our drinking there, and continued at a few bars in downtown Ft. Lauderdale.  Got pretty drunk on tanqueray and tonics.  Cut myself off at some point.  KA was really stressing about meeting women and trying to get laid.  He was being pretty annoying.  I understand that he wants to meet ladies, and have no problem with him doing so.  The issue comes when he blames AD and I for not "helping" him.  I certainly don't mind talking to girls at bars, but its not my most pressing issue -- I mainly just want to hang out with friends, then have a few drinks.   I feel like he is being selfish, and I hope he relaxes a little bit.  Another day, weather looks better.  Think we are going for a run soon.  Maybe we can get out some of his KA's pent up sexual frustration :).  Miss CW.

      As the Miami trip rapidly approaches, I realize that my friend has different priorities from mine. I his main goal is to find a girl, get laid, party. My goal is to surf, relax, and party. Regardless of any of these things, I know I must go with the flow. If I go worrying about money, then I won't be able relax, party or genuinely enjoy myself.  I think no matter what happens, the important thing to me is that I get a chance to surf (assuming waves are big enough). The good news is that some surfer somewhere forecasts this weekend will be a good one...  Been discussing some things with my girlfriend.  For the purpose of this blog, we shall call her CW.  I mentioned a few months ago how I really place a premium on my tolerant qualities.  While she didn't take issue with it at the time, my statement wasn't forgotten.   CW wasn't a big fan of my comment -- she would prefer me to appreciate difference qualities rather then to simply tolerate them.  I understand what CW meant, and in some sense agree with her.  However I can't help but feel that my statements are really being nitpicked.  My use of the word "tolerance" meant that I should make an effort to 1) understand that cultural differences exist, and 2) when those cultural differences are apparent, try to understand them and come to a reasonable comprimise.  I guess in some sense the reason I use the word "tolerate" is purely pragmatic.  I am most worried about cultural differences when an argument erupts, and a cultural difference is the underlying issue.  Will it be possible to appreciate cultural differences within this context?  I think she may understand most of this.  However I do somewhat betrayed, because I do try to understand and appreciate other cultures.  This isn't easy.  I've never left the western hemisphere, and in fact have never left the northern half of the western hemisphere.  I somehow don't view visiting Canada as much of an experience in cultural understanding :).   That being said  I am not exactly a home-body, but I' ve done virtually all of my traveling within the great U.S. of A. Think this blogging thing is becoming addicting.

      A quick introduction:  I'm N8.  Welcome to my Blog.  Thanks in advance for reading.  Former University of Maryland student, now working my first full time job out of school. I work for a small company in Virginia. I work in software.  I am a 24 years old,  politically opinionated and strong willed.   I run linux.  I try to keep fit. I was running 35 miles a week until I got injured about a month ago. Now I'm riding my bike a few times a week. It is satisfying, but as not quite the same as running was. The lack of frequency hurts too. Though I suppose that is in part my own fault.  I like film, "out there" music, the Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, NPR, and am a recovering Law &amp; Order addict.  Oh yea, I'm going to Miami thursday!  Should be a blast!  TaTa!  Til later...
