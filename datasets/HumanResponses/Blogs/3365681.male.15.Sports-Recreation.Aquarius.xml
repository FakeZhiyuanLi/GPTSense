      6 riders turn up for the ride today, Ismail, Mac, Edwin, Bloodyz and David and me. We met up at Tampines S11, had our breakfast and set off around 9.30. The weather was good. Ismail and me  thought of showing the other riders where Tiong Hin was. So we went through Bedok Reservoir, Kaki Bukit, Ubi and Lorong Ah Soo. We knew that it doesn't open so early, but we just show them where is the exact location. From there we encountered our first climb in the direction of Ang Mo Kio. We passed through a junction across Upper Serangoon and met up with a nice downslope. I was happily getting good speed down that I didn't notice that there was a drop in front of. I've  just drop, braced myself for the impact. I landed front wheel first, it skidded and luckily it  gripped the ground nicely or else I would have ended this trip prematurely.    We reached Ang Mo Kio MRT station and proceeded to S11 for our first stop of refreshments. Iced horlicks at only $0.60 per cup. But there the weather started to show its temper. We've decided  to move off fast as we heard the thunder clap. Along the way to Yio Chu Kang, as we were crossing the a road, I attempted to hop a curb but landed with clang sound from my rims. A short while  later, the tire went out with air, I knew I had a snake bite on my inner tubes. We found a bus-stop nearby and set down to patch the holes. Just as I was starting to patch it up, the rain came down heavily. We had to wait for the rain to slow to a drizzle before proceeding.    Ismail wanted to cut through Yishun but decided against it. We proceeded on with the direction heading west. Along the way Bloody had a fall when a bunnyhop went awry. Ismail had near misses of falling backwards while doing wheelie.    We reached Yew Tee around 1330. Some of the riders were in need of an urgent toilet break. We sourced for a coffeshop and decided to settle for lunch. Ismail had a plate of Nasi Goreng, Mac  had a plate of Mee Goreng, I had a plate of mixed vegetable rice, Bloodyz and David had 2 plates of Wanton noodles and Edwin had 2 plates of Chicken Rice. We went to a neaby void deck to settle some bike issues after our meal. The weather then started pouring hot rays of sunlight onto us. Well, this is Singapore's weather, as unpredictable as it can be.    From here, we progressed through Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang and Bukit Timah. Along Bukit Timah, we chanced upon Rain, a lady who had kindly rendered her services at some of the races. Well, as most riders would say do not ogle at pretty ladies when you're or you will pay for it. Well I'm a victim of it. I was trying to greet Rain but I didn't notice that Mac, Ismail had stopped in  front of me. No time to react, my front wheel slam into Mac's bike and I was thrown onto the fence that was on the left side of the pavement. No injuries, we had a chat with Rain and proceeded on.    We hit Newton after and proceeded towards the direction Sim Lim Square. It was long stretch of road. We had a hard time crossing at Newton to Kampong Java Road as it was a roundabout with tons of cars going about. When we saw KK hospital, we knew salvation is near. The weather was drying us up. We settle down at Tekka Food Center for refreshments. It was already 1530. We've thought of paying The Rebound Centre but he was closing at 1600. We decided to make our way home.    We went down to Bugis, thru Lavendar to Kallang. Just after we left Kallang MRT, the most astonishing thing happened. Edwin's saddle fell to the ground. We found out the allen key bolt of the seatpost that is used used for clamping the saddle had sheared to half. As the closest bike shop in the vicinity was Super Bike Pro, so we went there in hope of finding the bolt. Edwin had to continue without the saddle. When we reached there, the shop owner told us that he does not have it. No choice, we proceeded on.     Through Geylang Serai, we reached Eunos. We found an old bike shop but still no luck of finding the bolt. Down the road towards Kaki Bukit, another bike shop, still no luck. So Edwin had to proceed without the saddle thru Kaki Bukit to Bedok Reservoir. Ismail parted ways with us at Bedok Resevoir to return home. The rest of us ended our journey at the final destination, Tampines.
