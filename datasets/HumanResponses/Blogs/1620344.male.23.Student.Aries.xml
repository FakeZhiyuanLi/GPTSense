      Ok, sorry for the lack of updates recently.  I know that all 2 of you are disappointed(HI DAD!!!). This weekend I'm entered to race in the Northwest Hobie Cat  urlLink Championship Regatta  on  urlLink Lake Quinault .  It should be good times, provided the sailboat doesn’t tip over and I don't get whacked in the head with the boom.  Is anyone else about ready to go postal on Comcast for their dump the dish ad campaign?  I only watch maybe an hour of TV a day and I think every commercial break they have another ad for how getting a satellite ruined Steve's life and now he can't have kids and the use of his left leg is gone and he has no more friends.  DON'T LET IT HAPPEN TO YOU.  GET COMCAST DIGITAL CABLE NOW. BUY BUY BUY BUY.

      Ok I think It's about time I put up another post so here it is  Jeff On Recycling ......... Ok I think recycling is a good thing when done right but down here in Oregon they got it all screwed up. First of all you get charged for it and for a while you had to pay for the little bin and then they just decided to give everyone a bigger one and charge everyone more per month. This recycling is not optional so not only do they make money off of the stuff you give them you pay them to make money from you. This is BS but can be expected from a Hippy state but where it goes terribly wrong is they are picky and leave you nasty notes if you leave something in the bin that isn't recylable and leave it there not even bothering to put it in your garbage can or a garbage bin they have. Needless to say if I lived down here in Oregon there is no way in hell I would ever be recycling anything.   Well thats my rant for right now...On a side and more interesting note I almost had take out a 5 ft 6    55 year old man who started yelling and motioning like he was going to throw a punch at my step mom, he  backed off and went away but I was ready to kick some old man butt. That is a prime example of a real estate deal gone terribly terribly wrong. Anyways thats all for now.....We are working on getting a better westsixth working but this will have to do for now. Take it easy everyone.

      Ok, the page isn't rendering correctly in IE 6 so you can do 1 of 2 things:  1.  Wait for me to fix the page which might not be for a couple days because I work on HTML for 8 hours a day at work so the thought of messing with it at home doesn't exactly make me giddy.  2.  Download some form of  urlLink Mozilla .  I'm using Firebird right now but any of them will work.  Plus, Mozilla is just good to have anyways, it renders faster.  Its come a long ways since Netscape.   I just tried it a couple weeks ago and decided to use it as my primary browser.  Coming soon!  The page will actually be XHTML  urlLink compliant .  *gasp*

      Ok I'm in a Top 3 list mood today so the topic of this post will be   Adventures In Marketing  In todays deep analysis I will cover the top 3 nonhuman product spokesbeings.   3. Jack from the jack in the box commercials.           I'm not quite sure why but for some reason he really disturbs me to the point of almost having  nightmares about him.   2. The Geico Gekko           It should be no surprise he is on the list, we have all seen the commercial where he shacks up with that one chick deaming him the ladies man of the nonhuman advertising kingdom even beating out most human spokespersons   And the winner is ........   1. The Taco Bell Dog            This is a tough pick between the taco bell dog and the geico gekko but I find the dog the most memorable, who can forget all the great one liners of that legendary advertising campaign about the Taco Revolution.....I know I never will.   Honerable Mention: Mr. Clean             Mr. Clean is a bit of an enigma......What exactly is with that guy? It is my personal belief that he is very very gay.....not that theres anything wrong with that, but just look at the guy....something is seriously seriously wrong to the point of borderline disturbing

      Burger King is back on top as the king of burgers with the new All American Burger!  The new burger makes me salivate with delight at the meer thought of its greatness.  I'm sure the idea sprang up something like this...   Scene: Burger King Meeting    Bob:   Gentlemen, sales are down!  People aren't buying are delicious flame  broiled culinary delights like they used to.  I need ideas.  Something new, something fresh, something that will REALLY bring the people in.  I want this to be bigger than the Shaq Pack!   John:   How about little tiny hamburgers, we’ll call them burger buddies!   Bob:   Brilliant!  Start production immediately!   Ed:   Sir, that’s been done already.   Bob:   Ed, I like your style.  You’re hired.   Ed:   Sir, I’ve been working here for 13 years.   Bob:   Excellent, great to have you onboard the Burger King team.  Guys, I really need to you to pull out all the stops here.  I mean really, give me all that you’ve got.   John:   How about we take our biggest juiciest flame broiled patty, load it with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles.  We can call it the ALL AMERICAN BURGER.  It will be our biggest burger yet!   Bob:   Great idea John!  You may have saved the company.   Curtain

      For Eric's response all I have to say is Word!  If one is not Irish does that make one less worthy to eat lucky charms than one who is.......Ok maybe so, I think you got  me there, anyways its great to have you posting with us.   Now that I am writing a computer program for a real estate agent it is getting way too tempting to throw in little bugs that say, open the cdrom tray at choice well choreographed moments or other fun bugs like that but I will probably decide to have no fun and just do the professional thing. Working with the agents I also get in an ethics conundrum when it comes to touching up house pictures in photoshop because if I go to far we approach misrepresentation but I think I have found a good line which keeps it from getting out of hand.   Well I'm going camping tommorow at Suttle lake with my dad and some family so wont be making any posts till Sunday. Since I will be gone for a while I feel obliged to make this an extra special post so included is a picture guranteed to give you good dreams and make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Take it easy and have a good weekend everyone.

      Hello! I am Sara, and I will be writing the Great American Novel for you this evening, to be posted on our esteemed website, westsixth.net. And let me take this opportunity to say that I personally think that I am a more worthy member of this site than Jeff Dunlap. I think he's a great guy, don't get me wrong, and man, that guy can sled...but I don't think he's ever been to West Sixth Street in Aberdeen, the street this site is named for. My friend Adam would tell me to "stop sippin' Haterade" because Jeff is our friend. But honestly, I am going to have to claim my own superiority on this one.   The Great American Novel will have to be cut short this evening because my turn has come to go sing in the courtyard of the church where I work. Yes, I'm serious. Goodnight, and have a pleasant tomorrow.

      Ok so today I went to the gym to work on my pumptitude when I was presented with the common age old problem, Old people working out. Now don't get me wrong, I think it's good that they care about their health and have the motivation to work out but there was this one guy there who was terrible. For starters he was wearing these tight sweatpants up over his belly button, a white shirt that was at this moment grey and semitransparent because of the sweat, and to top it all off a headband. That type of appearel can be expected by old people but where this problem arises is they never clean the machines when they are done using them, followed by the problem of no longer being motivated to use a machine in you're routine that you have seen them on. This may sound trivial and it probably is but its on my mind today because it turned the effectiveness of my workout down a few notches.   Well thats all for right now so I will end this post with a quality pickup line.  I don't happen to have a library card but would you mind if I check you out.

      My daily morning commute is usually quite easy going, especially by big city standards.  It takes me about twenty minutes (or more depending on if the Winnebago Warriors are feeling frisky) most of it is on a tidy two lane highway towards the beach.  When you drive the same road every morning you begin to notice things, like the same crazy porcupine covered in ketchup that plays dead along side the road for four weeks, the randomly parked vehicles along the highway in strange gated off shoots covered with trees (the vehicles are always parked in front of the gates, and the gates always closed), the fact that a highway litter patrol that kindly took to the time out of its busy prison schedule to pickup garbage along side the road and left the bags of trash to rot for a week, and THE FREAKING PRISON GUARDS DRIVING TO WORK.  Without fail if I am on the highway anytime between 7:30 to 8:00 there will be a prison guard in one their two, count them two assorted vehicle types: minivan and Dodge Ram truck riding your bumper all the way up until the prison turn off.  It’s ironic because it’s the exact opposite experience driving to Centralia through Oakville.  All the way up until the turn off to The Lucky Eagle Casino (The legend is growing!) you can be confident of two things: passing by a speed trap and old people driving ten under until they get to casino.  Why all this useless banter over such a trivial topic?  I’ll let you know when I figure it out myself.

      Ok I think I will hop on the top 3 list bandwagon. In my deep analysis I will cover a frequently overlooked genre.   Top 3 Cartoons With Obese Characters   3. Popeye "Bruno" 2. Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers "Montery Jack" And the winner hands down is HEY HEY HEY 1. Fat Albert "Falt Albert Himself"        Honrable Mention  Garfield And friends: Garfield is pretty fat but maybe not quite obese.

      Alright, I updated the layout, sort of.  It still needs a little tweaking with the names and other things but its getting late and I have to work tomorrow.   Top three movies with midgets:   3. Death to Smoochy:  Sho'nuff!  2. The Wizard of Oz:  The type of midgets they had in the movie don't exist anymore because its now treatable, little know fact.  1. WILLY WONKA: Not only does it have midgets, it has dancing ones.   Honerable mention:     Austin Powers 2.  Sadly there is only one so it doesn't qualify for this list.  Ok, I really really need to go bed.  I'm glad that I stayed up to make that list.  I hope you are too.

      Ok so you know how cable advertising works right and how there are target audiences and all of that stuff. These target audiences sometimes make me wonder which one I'm in. I was watching a show today which I watch on a somewhat regular basis and I see one commercial for viagra or some type of erectile disfunction and I see one commercial for vagisil along with lots of assorted drug commercials such as that one that is suppose to keep you "regular". Once again the question arises what target audience am I in, and am I to think that most people who watch some of the shows I like have erectile disfunction or chronic constipation. On a even deeper note  how do these commercials which define my "target audience" define me as a person. My challenge to you is consider the same thing and how commercials define YOU as a person. And on a closing note I have to agree with the oustanding cinematical achievements that ARE the free pizza DVD's Eric was talking about. Well those are all my thoughts for now so I guess that is the end of this post.

Who can forget the time Bill and Ted run into their copies robo Bill and robo Ted?       Or the time in All Dogs go to Heaven 2 when uh.... wait I've never seen that, but in the first one doesn't that one dog buy pizza for the other dogs?  Well I'm sure the movie is simply scrumtolesent. I didn't update the layout yet.  Shoot me.  My grandma came over plus Best in Show was on.

      I would like to take this time to say that paint chips are cool. They are much better than those potatoes that only make you fat whereas paint chips make dreams come true. After working with realtors for the past month or so being an office assistant I have discovered my hatred for houses and longing for the world to find a new form of "housing". I really think bouncey castles are where its at but maybe thats just me.  Well thats all I'm thinking about right now so that will have to be the end of this post so I will end this post with a shoutout to my favorite dairy product Cheese.

      At last, actual content has arrived to westsixth!  Let the bed wetting begin.  I'm in Beaverton today at Sara's house.  She is off at a church leadership seminar so I've been running around her house eating paint chips like a 5 year old.  I gave Chelsea (Sara's dog) a bath in the backyard and of course she flipped out the moment water touched her.  She started wheezing like she was going to keel over and die(and she might, she is 12) so I expedited bath time to put her out of her seeming agony.  The moment she got back in the house she went back to normal.  Weird dog. Speaking of weird dogs...      Thanks Justin!  Sunday I will get the site design a little more customized.

      Yesterday I went over to lake Coeur D'Alene or however it is spelled and went swimming with a friend. Rumor has it that as I took my shirt off the whiteness could be seen from space but that is awaiting confirmation by NASA. My computer is still alive for the time being....It is unreal this summer of crashes, other than Eric's crashes and mine I know of at least 3 other people who had wicked unexplainable crashes.  Being at the lake and having  Pirate Fever  as previously discussed I thought about how awesome it would be to have a pirate ship in a lake like that. Who would expect to have a Pirate Ship sneak up behind them and unload all the canons on their sorry land lubber behinds, I will tell you that I sure as heck wouldn't and most likely I would soil myself at the sheer coolocity. Well that is all for now so untill later........take it easy mateys.

      It’s been the summer of computer crashes, at least for Jeff and I.  I've reloaded my computer no less than 5 times this summer, yesterday being number 5.  I finally got so sick of this hard drive crashing business, (which was partially due to my own stupid self not noticing that my ram has been somewhat overclocked), that I got a  urlLink raid controller card  and identical drives running  urlLink RAID 1  so hopefully that solves some problems.  It seems like computers create more problems in my life than they solve sometimes (I usually think this after work when I'm wishing for total technological oblivion).  It seems that everyone this summer has pirate fever, and I must say I am DEFINETLY not the exception.  But Eric you ask, how do I know if I have pirate fever?  Well dear reader, luckily I've compiled a list of signs that you too may in fact have the condition known as PIRATE FEVER.   Symptoms may include but are not limited to:  - Waking up with a knife in your mouth, being initially disturbed but find a strange comfort in having a stainless steel blade between your teeth  - Pillaging change from the couch and having the urge to burry it in the backyard  - Plundering second helpings of the fried chicken your mom made for you  - Not saying please and thank you when telling scalawags to walk the plank  - Thinking of ways you can loose your leg in hopes of getting a prosthetic limb  - Won't get off rope swing  - Finding new excuses to eat more Cap'n Crunch  - An unhealthy obsession with Pippi Longstockings Dad  My top choices for a pirate pet would have to be a dog.  My photographic is evidence enough to strike fear into any naysayers heart.

      Ok I guess its time for another post.....I would have done it earlier but my computer has been a dirty dirty tramp. I get home from Salem OR and was greated with this lovely "your hard drive hast crashed and you are screwed message" luckilly it turned out to be my second hard drive and I could somewhat recover. So I ended up getting a newer and better hardrive.....a few days later my power supply blew up.............I kid you not I hear this loud pop from the other room run in and smell silicon and see all this smoke coming from my computer and then for wishfull thinking I push the on button but nothing happened so I went out and got a new powersupply and it is working for the moment. Unfortunately I have nothing entertaining to say to amuse you right now. On a side note I saw Pirates of the Carribean and it was quite eye opening. I have been planning on quitting school to be a pirate for some time now and in Pirates I saw that one pirate had a pet monkey, so now I have been in deep deep thought about what my animal of choice will be....right now I'm kind of leaning toward monkey but I am open to suggestions. Well thats all is all for now, it feels good to be retired from my lame lame job so you might hear a little more from me, take it easy everyone and enjoy the rest of your summer.

      Ok you are going to soil yourself when you all here what fine Pizza Hut DVD I got my hands on.....None other than All Dogs Go To Heaven 2. You may want to take a little time now to go change your shorts before reading the rest of of my post. Today I am flying a plane to Tilamook minus takeoff and landing that is.....I'm not quite to that point yet but It will be fun.......maybe I will see some cheese or something. Last weekend I went to an air musuem and saw an SR71 Blackbird along with all sorts of world war 2 fighters like corsairs, messerschmits and all that good stuff. They also have the Spruce Goose there which is a famous airplane for being the largest ever made and could only fly 200 yards. The Goose is unbelievably huge you could easily fit 2 or 3 SR71 Blackbirds in the cargo area alone. Well thats all for now I am oficially retired for the rest of the summer and I could not be more thrilled because on thursday I spent 3 hours teaching an 80 yr old how to use a computer so after that and all the normal office assistant junk on top of the program I deveoped I am soooooo ready to quit. Take it easy everyone.

         As a test to break into the Amish market I'm selling fun colorful "What Would Amish Do?" bracelets to Amish teens over the internet. The bracelets serve 3 purposes:         They provide a fun colorful      way to let other kids at school know that they are Amish.    When faced with a tough situation, like a pusher offering them drugs, they can flash the bracelet and remind themselves W.W.A.D.?  The drug dealer would then  so taken back that they are Amish that his head would explode.    Great sweatbands for raising      barns.              The second phase of this marketing test involves a revamp of the 80's television show "The Incredible Hulk" set to an Amish theme. Mr. T can also guest star if he wishes.     Phase 1         Phase 2 (Required)

      Ok I know it's been a while but as of this post I am officially back in the blogging world so here it is.   Jeff's Latest Business Idea  In the field of marketing we all know about demographics and how certain groups are targeted, however there is currently one group who gets no love at all. That's right.....as you guessed I am of course talking about the Amish. In the past this very lucrative market segment has received little to no attention,  so any new product targeting this segment can enter the market virtually uncontested experiences little to no competition. I know some of you out there may be saying  "Hey Jeff isn't that unethical"  and I would answer your question with a question-parable of my own  "How can the Amish say they don't need an iPod if they don't know what an iPod is".  My parable is mostly rhetorical in nature but the word iPod can be replaced with virtually any consumer good they dont know about.  Who are these Amish people to discriminate against products and goods they dont even know.  This sounds a little bit like the concept of hating people you dont know which most people would say is bad. By implementing a campaign to target the Amish, the primary goal of profits and sales could be realized, while fullfilling a secondary and indirect objective of discouraging discrimination.

         I know there has been a small minority of you want and  waiting  for the westsixth.net blog to become active again. It my pleasure, na- my privilege to re-open the westsixth.net blog to you once again.    In keep with the grand tradition of fine pirate oriented writing I want to share with you some of the tidbits of pirate wisdom that I have had a chance to reflect on this past year:         Treasure chests, while a      great place to store your loot are not always a great place to store      perishable goods.    Pastels are always good, particularly when they are used in a bandana to accentuate your eyes. When used to make pants it can had a festive feeling that lightens the mood of your entire crew.    Parrots can be a mess! I recommend making shoulder pads out of newspaper to alleviate this problem. The thicker the pads the better.    Ask your health care provider if there is a co-pay for your crew mates diagnosed with scurvy or if it’s completely covered.

      Ok, I haven't dropped off of the face of the earth but farely close.....I'm in Oregon. So the other day Kim and I were on cruise touring the sound and lake Washington and we saw Bill Gate's house so I felt obliged to post some stats. 45,000 Square Feet, 3/4 ths of the house is subteranian. Value = 113 Million He has a beach with sand imported from Hawaii and the carribean. I could go on but that is enough.  We also saw the house of the guy who created Windows and I will tell you I have never seen a how with that many Windows, they even looked to be layed out like the windows Logo. We also went up the space needle and I managed to hock a luggie off so I was pretty proud of that one. It took a few trys but in the end Jeff was successfull. Well thats all for now, I would have been posting more but I have had very little computer access. Well for all of you many many Westsixth fans take it easy and you will hear from me when I start posting regularly again in a week.

         Walter Cronkite had an excellent  urlLink reflection on the   Gulf  of  Tonkin   resolution today on NPR .    Some of the phone conversations that are public now are amazing.       It’s kind of a long piece (20 minutes), but if you have the attention span, I highly recommend you listen to it.    Cronkite raised some excellent comparisons to the current political climate in a way that only he can.
