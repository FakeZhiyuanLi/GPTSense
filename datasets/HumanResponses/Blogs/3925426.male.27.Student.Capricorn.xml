      ahhhh. I am now among the elite ranks of bloggers all over the world. This seems appropriate. I am starting a new life in two days. Moving from my home of nine years, Houston, Texas, to Anchorage, Alaska. I guess I will find out if I can discipline myself to post in this thing regularly.   about 48 hours till I am out of Houston. I am excited to be leaving, and yet feel overwhelmingly apprehensive at the same time. I laid in bed before falling asleep last night, wondering if I have made the right choice. I am so sure I have, yet there is something. What is there for me here? I have everything is all. A career, great friends, my own place, an amazing life. I have so many memories here. Good and bad. This really has become my home. And what am I going to? Everything again. School, my father and stepmother. My new little brother. Good friends. A healthier environment. I guess I am just breaking the monotony my life has become. Since my divorce, I have been locked in the same cycle with no end in site. I work hard all the time, and play hard all the time. An endless string of one night stands and parties. Another certification in my field of work here and there. Being affluent with the local jazz and blues scene and frequenting all of that often. Lots of great, great vacations to different places. Camping trips every month. But no depth. No true love. I am not motivated here anymore. Everywhere I go, I am reminded of Becky. I always feel her right behind me and next to me. I am still tortured by memories of her and love for her. My best and closest friends are growing up and changing. I am growing up and changing. Yes, I can work hard anywhere. I can party anywhere if that is what I want. I can always do the things that I do here anywhere. It is time to leave, and I am.   Maybe its not the decision I have made that has something in me unsettled. maybe it is not knowing what I am going to do when I get there. Do I really want to live with my dad after being out on my own for so many years? Where am I going to work. I have to buy a new vehicle. I have to find a job. I need to get registered in school. I am not going to play the 'what-if' game. I have to chill out and take it as it comes. I am perfectly capable of doing, and dealing with, anything.   So my new life is about to begin. I am excited despite these concerns. I am excited to meet my little brother. I cannot wait to get to know him and to watch him grow up. I am so happy to know I will be near my father again. I have missed him terribly. I am excited to get to be with my step mother, whom I have only just begun to get to know. I am really happy that I will be close to my greatest and dearest friend, Ambria. I do look forward to laughing with her. I am looking forward to the mountains, the sunny summers and cold winters. The wildlife and the nature. SNOWBOARDING. The fishing and camping and hiking and climbing and everything I love to do so much that will be right outside my door. I am happy to be getting away from the traffic and pollution and crowds and skyscrapers. I am looking forward to getting back to school. A whole new life. I have dropped everything I have. Given away or sold all my possessions except for the most sentimental and personal. And now the time has come to get the hell out of town.  Two more days and I am out of here. Feels epic.   Okay cliff, next time, write the way you normally do. This blather sux.
