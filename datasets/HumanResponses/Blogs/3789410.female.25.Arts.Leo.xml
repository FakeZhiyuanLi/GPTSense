      Ok. so today has not been a very productive day for me. I feel so unmotivated. Spoke to my partner at work just half hour ago... He told me that he is also unmotivated. And feels I should just take a weeks break with pay to concentrate on searching for a job. Well, me thinks the same way... maybe I'm really not cut out for and Account servicing job. His personal perspective of me not liking to speak to people. Feels that I am more on the creative than the extrovert type. hmmm... I really wonder. I have like 2 personalites! At work and out of work. Yet on the other hand, I try to dress for 2 personalities but I just cannot make it! Ahah!

      Well, today started off pretty much great. Actually, had a bad start. Came to work late. But everything else seem to fall in place soon after I got started on work. Came in as usual, do my usual checking of emails..etc. Then, early this morning, got a call to do some casting! Hooray! :) Am quite excited about it though its not like a job offer which I think I need much more than anything else right about now - I'll be soon out of job in a weeks time... I'm still taking it as lightly as anyone who comes from a filthy rich family! I can't believe it!  Soon after, I asked for a job as a freelance designer ( was actually trained in design) after my last day. Everything seem to be in bits and pieces right now and flying all over the place actually. But I think I'll be good after a while. Don't really want to get myself into this pool of preposterous imaginary dream realm once again. I seem to be busy yet me thinks my partner knows I'm not. Thinks he's just letting me go...slowly...calmly...steadily...  I think he's quite something. Although sometimes it's difficult to read his thoughts. And yes! I do get some shite attitude from him once in a while. Very temperamental. But I truely think he's a great guy. And quite cute too for his age! Ahah! Oh well...  It seems I have a lot to say today. I'm still eagerly awaiting the news of another casting job. I hope to get it. Just sent in my picture. Maybe the Director wil not like my profile...whatever.

      Came home early from work. Yet my mum started nagging... why is this so? It happens such that when you reach a certain age, you must achieve certain things in life. Well sometimes I reflect upon it and ask myself. Who is it for? My family or myself? I started work in a new line recently. Not in realation to what I have studied. The pay is terrible compared to what I used to get. But I am fulfiled right now. In terms of job satisfaction. I am happy with what I do. Does money really matter that much? Maybe it does. It is to feed oneself. What has the society become?

      Am sitting right here at my desk figuring out how to use this blog thing. Its pretty much quite cool but I have to try and get use to putting my thoughts into a computer system. My boss is seated right at the back of me and I'm wondering if he could see me do this at all... Been wanting to have a ciggie for sometime now... And only the 2 of us in the office! OMG! The people here are really missing in action most times. I am going for a cig break now.

      Just learnt yesterday that the Heineken thingy is this Saturday. Oh no... My week is fully packed with plans. That's great I love it! But I gotta go visit my grandma whom i've not seen in a 2 weeks. And that'll prob be this Sat. Goodnesss... Yeaterday was at this place called Jazz something. It's a Jazz hangout. Life music is not bad. Was introduced to a guy who does some music producing and stuff. Can't wait to pass him hittingplanes samples to listen to them and see he if can help us do some chill recording for the band! :)  Then there was this dude. A skankie man! Really quite nerdy looking. But cute. Really cute. And I told a friend of mine and he told his friend who's the friend of the skankie! Hahahha... know what I'm getting at? oh well.. Wanted to like start talking to him but then it sorta spreaded that I think he's cute and thus, i became shy. So shy that even when that friend of his that was told by my friend tried to help make things happen, I just declined to offer... :P What a load or rubbish! Ahah!  Did not have enough sleep last night. I am a little stoned right now. Shortly left for some supper in the east side. Was introduced to an eating joint there. Really great food. And my poor friend whom I had supper with, got tickets from the parking attendant! At bloody one fifty something in the morning! My my... the govenment really work the staff hard here. What shite.   Think I gotta go for another caffine dosage soon... Really getting to feel lethargic...floating...really stoned out soon.

      Hooray! This week is superb! Got plenty of things happening at one go for the rest of the week. I feel totally rejuvinated, apart from my daily routine of coming to work and not doing anything much for the day... I am to be out of the office in 15mins time. Can't wait. Hee hee. Oh no I forgot. I left some of my cab claims at home. Hope my mum did not throw them away, They bloody hell cost me like more than a tenner! And obviously I shall not want to pay for it. Tonight's some function/exhibition gathering with ATan and some mates from the film industry. Really nice dude. Can't wait to mingle... haha.. like I really enjoy it eh? Oh by the way, psycho came over as I am about to write something on my blog! Luckily I have not typed anything at all... so he asked me to go out to balestier. Really far. Again got to claim for cabbie. Can't wait for this evening before the function. My first propoer formal interview since I started my job here.

      Hee hee... Am seated at the office right now with pretty much nothing to do. Been not at my desk the whole day. Today has been a really slow day. Down only 2 cups of coffee. One thick the other thin. My psycho partner is also not in the office. He came in this morning for a short period of time. Yet he did not ask me do anything. And I went for lunch. Shortly after when i'm back, its written on the movement board he is out til 4pm for meetings at various places. Yet it is 5.30pm right now and there is still movement from him. Perhaps he's having a drink at this moment with certain clients. Perhaps he just don't want to come back to the office. We have been in such situations a few times now. He'll get pissed at me for a small trivial matter of reason and he expects me to know why! Then I gotta crack my brain to figure out what's it like inside that head of his! It is weird. Me thinks he's truely PSYCHO. Am waiting for time to pass..again.. going down to this place called cafe society at empress place. Bringing my showreel along. Mingle. Get bussiness. Make friends. Can't wait.

      Today I woke with a splitting and the most heavy head in a long time... But I shall relate my thoughts for today later in this episode... Was out on a shoot yesterday and could not go back to work on time. I had a missed call after the shoot and found that it was from my company. Thus, I returned the call thinking that it might be the administration lady just confirming my day's leave. She did not. So I asked to connect to my partner whom I work closely with thinking that he might have something urgent to tell me. I should not have returned the call. Never return calls from the office unless necessary. I was astounded with the utmost obnoxious behavoiur from him! He asked if I were to return to work and I merely asked a simple question:"It would be a little late if I come back to work now right?" Then he went beserked and snapped:" You should not be talking in this manner!" and slammed down the phone on me. My my...sometimes I do wonder how can I tolerate such preposterous behaviour.

      hey hey... just came back from a short smoke break. oh well. been slacking real hard. any takers? just checked through my email. and i was sent an email from marv! great. but it was really short. and platonic. and boring. oh well. it is the end for us i guess. not at all even a chance to like get back together whatsoever. my heart still beats for that dude... sigh... got this fren timmy who is a DJ. he has this event coming up nest saturday at phuture. and i gotten some invites from him. just passed one to my boss's brother! think he will like it :) drum and bass! haha! im bored to death. what should i do but to write. yet on the other hand, i'm not so much into the mood of writing right now. maybe its the typing thing. it does not feel as personal as a journal hand written. Should i leave the office right now? i really am impelled to do so at this present moment. oops just cliked onto some keys on my keyboard and this page went full screen! :P okae back to the reality of wanting so much to lift my arse out of my seat and have a quick beer at KAZ bar now. (KAZ bar is a drinking joint at Far East Sq near my workplace. Realy cheap beer before 7pm! like only $6.50 for a Magnum pint! Goodness!) My psycho colleague seemed really busy at this moment. This afternoon, we went to bugis for lunch. He is doing somethings with a new local magazine. One which is on his own and not work related. and they are looking for models for the magazine. fresh faces. he was really shy and unsure of how to approach a girl who works around there. Thus, my lunch date. :) btw, its an 'adult' magazine. but it is creative and eroctic at the same time! why don't he ask me? hahha! :P I feel this special glow in me whenever i am able to provide my services to help anyone. yet sometimes i feel, when will i ever get rewarded. i know one should never start thinking of the rewards even way before they start helping people. yet, i feel sometimes quite miserable... lost in life. i have everything. yet nothing. lots of frens whom i love,adore, my family, a great job yet to come along the way...(argh!!) maybe i am really too fusy over the jobs i want. i am offered jobs in broadcast that pays really well. and some people i never heard of have seen my work and they tell me its great! some would kill to be in my shoes for that kind of position. yet i am unsatisfied. i just know that i can do better with something i have more passion for. something which is not only desk bound but human related. PR...mingle. get real. it is only 6.30pm now and i am still wating for the time to pass. just bought a red bull to boost up my energy level. i am not energised today. perhaps it is the clubbing last night. too much alcohol in my bloodstream as well. i need to detox. one of my gf/colleague just called to say she is not attending the drinking session this evening. hmmm... should i feel upset? haha! well she's my mate even bofore i started working here... oh well why do i get this strange feeling tonight is not going to happen? perhaps i think too much. of the boring company i'm going to be with...haha! if they are boring, would i drink with em? :P everyone is busy except me... that's why. and i am really just too looking forward to this evening. :)

      okae...so i met up with my ex again on monday evening.. for dinner and some drinks and I couldn't wake up in the next morning! we hung out til late. this explains my not editing my post everyday... nothing much or exciting been happening in my life right now. just been to lots of interviews lately. and to some auditions for tv programmes but me thinks i suck at it still! speaking of that, i will be appearing in the 'gong xi fa cai' mandarin series on Channel U really soon i think... episode 47! haha... just a 'care-le-fair' role :P and i will also be appearing in 'Durian King' next to Adrian Pang in a few weeks or so! Ahah! I've never been so excited. But all is for fun..! hooray! ;) came to work this morning and i had great vibes. Last night, went for dinner for a girlfren's birthday. Nothing much. but I haven't seen her since Saturday. She seldom party these days.. She has been dropping huge hints to me that I should just go back to my ex.. been thinking... and the most delightful thing happened! My skankie actually text me! Says his first day at work after coming back is terrible... oh well at least now i know he's still alive! And my other skank text me too.. we should be meeting up next week. coz both our schedule is packed for the week. I should be going down to liquid tonight after a movie with a fren of mine and my ex's. Then head down there! Free drinks for ladies.. anyone? :) Tomorrow, there'll be this sorta like farewell party drinking session for me with my cutest most loving colleagues! Can't wait actually.. coz one of em Japanese is really cute! Well actually, two of em Japanese..oh urmm..methinks three of em is really cute! haha! I must really seem like an 'obssessed with men' person... but oh well i do not really care what people think of me. Just being myself. And i DO like people's company. And different people. The more the merrier! Is my blog getting too long? Can't help but to think right a the back of my head that people are reading this blog! but i think not. No one has access to it at all... Ahah! This morning when I came into work, my psycho colleague actually greeted me! And he bought me coffee! What a sweet gesture! oh well... today is fine so far. I'll probably update again later.

      The weekend has ended. all that exist now are empty spaces, hangovers, dumps and stoners. went down to lola for a bit on friday night and saw my bosses younger brother! he was dancing alone there to drum and bass! never knew an old man of his age will consume into such music! he looked as if he was stoned! So hilarious! I spoke to him just now and told him what I saw during the weekend.. just love teasing people...ahah! The weekend has been super great for me. I bumped into Marv on Saturday afternoon. He looked so different now. With his hair cut, and he looked like some rocker. He seem to have lost weight as well :) I spoke to him for a bit. And never knew that I still have a thing for him after these months! My heart beat accelerated by the minute! So that was a fruitful few minutes. I was hanging out with this dude who's a fren of my ex. But everything went a little out of the comfort zone when things are still not really clear between my ex and myself. we were at ice cold beer having some drinks when my ex approached. we were suppose to meet him there. and he seemed really pissed. this whole issue about me getting this new 'status' of becoming 'vicious' and not following my dreams anymore is killing him. i am wondering. why come to this extend when you were the one who was unsure of what you wanted? i am happy with my new life right now. I met up with him last night and we spoke a little of it. And it is settled. At least for now. Went down for the heineken party on Saturday at Marina. Saw my colleague. This Japaense dude whom I think is quite cute. hee hee... but I saw him with this other freelancer girl whom I think is quite a babe! But I am sorta confused... hmmm... I thought she is something she is not. Yet I might be wrong. On the other hand, if they were seeing each other, then I am wrong. Hahaha... When i greeted them, he seemed really delighted. And he even commented that I'm cute! ahah! oh well.. I exchange numbers with her tho and we should be hanging out sometime... ;) Well, the only sad thing sbout this weekend was that one of my skankie was not around. Well actually the both of them was not around. He was suppose to be back on Saturday as he'd text me earlier in the week to say he was to be back. but he has not text me since...:( Well! its okae. Coz my other skank did give me a huge suprise by texting me uninformed! And I was quite delighted at that notion! Made my day yesterday! hee hee... Am still waiting for time to sort of pass so I can like 'sneak' off work to meet my prospective employer. I was really late for work. And I think it is not really nice to leave early. Don't understand why this sudden conscious got into me. I could not care less last week!  Kay I really got to go now...

      Today is Friday. the last day of the first week of my non working days. i was sort of&nbsp;busy yet not really. allow me to breifly fill in my life for the past days i have not been blogging. hahaha! do you even call this blogging? hmmm... :P  Last fri, supposed my last day, i was so free... went for lunch then coffee break then when i went back to the office, i realise i've yet to send out emails&nbsp;informing my clients it is to be my last day! and that i have to uninstall some of the softwares i had installed earlier on... i am having a very bad headache now... perhaps its the lack of nicotine.. havent been smoking much the past 2 days due to my severe sore throat that had lead me loosing my voice.. but i am much recovered now. Thanks to my Dhasedyl&nbsp;and Pacofen which i keep in handy at home! actually, my home is like a mini-pharmacy...! so if i can't sleep...hmm... Let's see.. what happened during the weekend? hmmm... nothing much? and what happened during the week? monday, went down to newsroom bar. there's this frend's birthday. they opened botttles of chivas! This bunch of friends that i have are lord of drinkers! they are alcolholics. they&nbsp;drink everyday. and seldom get hangovers. go to work the next morning early. even drink on a mondays! can you take that?&nbsp;they are one of my srinking buddies. especially the one who's birthday was that day. and i'm always he only girl to drinking buddies... hmmm i wonder why... anyway, i havent had that kinda alcohol for a long time. normally just beers... ;) Tuesday.. let's see... oh my. my life is pathetic! i dun think i went anywhere on&nbsp;tuesday! how's that? maybe&nbsp;it is due to the&nbsp;fact that&nbsp;the hole in my bank account is getting bigger by the minute! and i'd really better&nbsp;get a job soon in order to pay back a close fren of mine who might be out of job soon.. i should be able to support him when he is not working! a friend in need is a friend indeed! :P  There was this advertising in the air thingy on wednesday at fort canning park. went down to collect the tickets from my fren. then got a little pissed for having need to travel so far and about to get tickets not only for myself but for friends too... havent been in much of a mood to like go out and party lately... think i'm in one of that mood thingy again.. swinging sixties! ahah! Gotta stop seeing my EX! Really got to... He is making my curent life evolve only around him! and now that i am no longer working, makes it worst! i have no money, am broke, thus the only person i can fully sort of depend on is... HIM! which makes me sick! and the idea of this whole dependant relying thingy is making me feel indisposition! i never had to rely on anyone. not at all. seriously. never. i can't believe how cheap i have succumbed myself to! always compelled to meet him these days... argh!!!! why is it so?  And yesterday, suppose to meet up one of my skankies for movies, i turned down.. :( due to the fact that i really gotten ill. was having a bit of sore throat and cough. now, i am having a major splitting headache! maybe i just sleep too much. maybe not enough caffine. maybe not enough nicotine. maybe just not enough sex. or not enough money for boozing. definately not enough alcohol in my bloodstream... didn't drink for 2 days this week! (tues & thurs) Bump into the skank that i was suppose to meet yesterday for a movie, at fort canning on wednesday.. i seriously think that this country is really too small. if you enjoy the same type of activities, you will&nbsp;definately end up seeing each other somewhere...somehow.. there was this period where i keep knocking into the other skankie. now it is this one... when will i ever learn?  saw this girl who is my ex classmate's ex girlfriend. ok let me make it easier. saw alan's ex gf. yeah she is still with the same skank i saw the last time at marina where there was&nbsp;some film fest. oh well&nbsp;why does&nbsp;she get all the nice cute skanks? why not me? i never turn up at these occasion with the skanks that i want. and it is always so that i am the playful one? i do wonder... we need an occassional tender loving care once in a while. Just popped in 2&nbsp;pills thinking it would not make me drowsy... as it did not take on any effect last night and i could not sleep. insomnia. but not for now...it just happened. i am feeling 'high'... high on life? :P
