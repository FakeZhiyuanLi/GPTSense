      yesterday, in scho0l, cricket, my classmate, l0st her 3660--her brand new dream ph0ne. s0 we did a litte inspecti0n. it didn't turn up. =C we have 0ur suspects..but we think it's unfair t0 assume.  anyway..that's all i remember fr0m yesterday's events cause that was like the highlight.  0h..yeah..we had 0ur first h0useh0ld f0r the YFC year last night. tit0 glenn picked gwen and me up then we picked every0ne else up, then we went t0 the venue and waited f0r kuya ri0 t0 arrive. can i just share? HE-WH0-MUST-N0T-BE-NAMED [f0r his 0wn pr0tecti0n] was there. and when i saw him, deep inside i was like, "dang. i can d0 better than that!" hehe. am i mean? i'm n0t saying he's ugly--'cause he's n0t. there are days that he actually attracts me [else i w0uldn't have fallen s0 bad]. but n0w..he d0esn't attract me anym0re..his hair's l0ng [which i d0n't really like cause it lo0ks messy]..and well, i kinda realized that he wasn't my type after all! hehe. falling makes y0u blind. eew. ANYWAY...lo0king n0t s0 go0d actually makes it easier f0r me t0 m0ve 0n. thank y0u, mr. basili0..;D  i just f0und 0ut that there's this girl wh0's REALLY ruining my reputati0n. it sucks 'cause i KNOW i didn't d0 anything t0 her,s0 why w0uld she. i'm h0ping she gets 0ver whatever she has against me...i'm really a great pers0n 0nce y0u get t0 kn0w me..0r at least i think i am! ;D i have n0 plans 0f c0nfr0nting her ab0ut it. there's n0thing i feel guilty 0f.  i g0t h0me at 12:30am. kuya ri0 to0k me h0me.

      a friend 0f mine gave me this s0rt 0f p0em..[is it?] check it 0ut...i think it was made f0r me.:  h0w d0 y0u REALLY kn0w if y0u're inl0ve? as in H)W?  d0 y0u feel this queasy feeling inside y0ur st0mach? the kind that makes the wh0le 0rgan jump?  d0 y0u dream ab0ut him at night... and y0u just lie in bed n0t kn0wing what t0 d0? and y0u fall int0 slumber, with a smile =) because the last th0ught that entered y0ur mind is him?  every m0ment y0u see him is just so0o0o special especially if it's just 0nce in a purple mo0n... that m0ment... leaves such a scar 0n y0ur heart. the kind y0u want t0 h0ld 0n t0 f0rever.  d0es he enter y0ur mind when y0u feel l0w? and y0u just sh0ut 0ut, "G0d, i wish he c0uld h0ld me n0w!" and y0u imagine. and everything's alright.  he smiles, y0u smile. he laughs, y0u get a high. he strumms the guitar, y0u melt. he lo0ks at y0u, y0u just want t0 die.  and th0ugh y0u wish y0u c0uld h0ld him... because y0u kn0w his w0rld isn't just smiles... and laughter... and music in his s0ul... y0u just want t0 h0ld him. as l0ng as p0ssible. as tightly... until he c0uld let g0. but...  y0u can't. because... he's n0t there.  he's 0nly in y0ur dreams. 0nly in y0ur dreams. in reality... is where he sh0uld be. in reality...  is where he isn't. because in reality, he smiles...but the smiles are n0t f0r y0u. he laughs...but n0t with y0u. he strumms the guitar...but the s0ng is f0r SOMEONE ELSE.  and n0 matter h0w hard y0u try t0 think... and imagine... that y0u c0uld h0ld him cl0se... y0u can't. y0u can't.  because s0me0ne else is. y0u see him cry, it's n0t YOU wh0's drying the tears. it's s0me0ne else. and n0w, it's YOU wh0's crying. and n0 0ne... n0 0ne. is drying y0urs.  but still all the tears y0u cried all the hurt and the pain... c0uld n0t st0p y0u fr0m dreaming... ab0ut the smile =)... the stare... the laughter... the sweet n0tes 0n thje guitar... because in the hurt y0u find a certain happiness. alth0ugh y0u kn0w that y0u will never be the 0ne t0 dry the tears, t0 hear the s0ngs, t0 return the smile, it's alright. he will always be in y0ur mind. in y0ur heart. f0rever. and f0rever he will be.  as l0ng as he's happy, y0u are. and if that's the way 0f the w0rld, then let it be,  but it w0n't st0p y0u fr0m letting him exist. in here. IN HERE.  n0w can s0me0ne tell me? h0w d0 y0u kn0w?  ***ack. bagay ba? ;D

      what happened t0day..hmmm....  bef0re classes started, j0y ann and i visited sam..witel sammy g0t me a vict0ria's secret c0l0gne fr0m the states. she g0t me a vanilla scent 'cause she knew i was s0mewhat addicted t0 it.ü  first subject was filipin0. Mrs. Are was absent s0 we had t0 d0 this insane seatw0rk 0n a 1 wh0le sheet 0f paper, and it was really l0ng. g0t sick 0f reading the name BASILIO..but i kn0w it d0esn't end there. he's g0nna be ar0und f0r the wh0le b0ok unf0rtunately. [just in case y0u're w0ndering: BASILIO's what i used t0 call s0me0ne wh0 i sh0uld n0t name ever again. 0r else my dad'll have my head]  recess time j0y and i spent laughing at each 0ther as we ate a b0x 0f harry p0tter BERTIE BOTT'S EVERY FLAVORED BEANS. hmm..the grass flav0red 0ne REALLY tasted like grass. during physics, we did s0mething s0mewhat like an amazing race. my gr0up actually was supp0sed t0 be the first t0 finish. we just missed 0ut 0n s0mething. PE was spent swimming breaststr0ke. g0t a n0ice 10 0ut 0f 10 in the practical test. lunch time, mars [david's girlfriend] and kat "my lavs" ate in my classr0om. by my seat, actually. mars spent alm0st the wh0le lunch time checking if i was eating my f0od. [been having eating pr0blems lately. david instructed her t0 make sure i ate]. funny piece 0f bitter reality: i was the 0nly 0ne in 0ur lunchgr0up t0day wh0 didn't have a b0yfriend, n0r a l0velife at the least. OH WELL!! A&D sucked. sir d0n [the teacher wh0 c0ncentrates m0re 0n keeping his w0rds fl0wery instead 0f us actually learning] gave this irritating graded recitati0n in which he just HAD t0 c0ntradict everything we said. [damn c0in-jiggling teachers!] math time, i didn't listen. cricket and i spent m0st 0f the peri0d thinking 0f what i c0uld give my bestbud martin f0r his birthday. we were unsuccessful, by the way. and alas, english. sir omer [the brand-new-gay-physics-teacher] 0bserved 0ur class. haha. wasn't much.  basically that was my day. 0hyeah. i suck. i l0st keziah's swim cap [which i b0rr0wed earlier f0r PE]. s0 i'm g0nna have t0 buy her a new 0ne--which c0sts like, P400. sho0t.

      last night's epis0de 0f buffy was 0ne 0f the m0st breathtaking epis0des 0f any tv series i have ever seen in my entire life! i w0n't g0 int0 detail 0n what happened, but 0hmyg0sh was it exciting. i was at the edge 0f my seat!!  spike died...i knew he was g0ing t0...but i was kinda h0ping he didn't have t0... sad nga eh..'cause when he was ab0ut t0 die, buffy t0ld him she l0ved him f0r the very first time. the c0nversati0n went s0mething like this...  buffy: i l0ve y0u. spike: n0 y0u d0n't. but thanks f0r saying it anyway. n0w, g0.  that's when buffy left, and spike died. he died a her0. i'm s0 pr0ud 0f him...snif! the c0nversati0n kinda reminds me 0f s0mething th0ugh...  "i d0n't kn0w if i'm really supp0sed t0 say this..but they t0ld me t0 get everything 0ut. i l0ve y0u."  "s0rry."  w0w that sucks. that's pr0bably the worst reply t0 i-l0ve-y0u imaginable. but hey. we're n0t in m0vies, n0w are we? reality boites.
