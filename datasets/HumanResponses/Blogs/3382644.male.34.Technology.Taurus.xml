      Played another PSO tournament.  Limit this time.  It was good playing tonight.  I still placed 20th out of 53 but I am not disappointed with my play.  I think I played my cards right for the most part.  I over bet a few times and that hurt me more than anything else.  It's always my betting that gets me in trouble.  I'm starting to see a lot of the same people too.  That helps to get a feel for some of the players.  This is it for awhile.  I'll be on vacation until June 7th, so I won't post again until then.  I'll be playing a lot of simulations on my Wilson programs though.    Indiana Slim

      I finally got my Wilson software tonight.  I got turbo holdem with the sid and tournament holdem.  I played the turbo for about an hour.  The SID is well worth it.  After analyzing my play for an hour, I know that I play my hands correctly.  It found no problem with card selection, but it found weakness in my better strategy.  I figured that anyway.  I need to raise more often and not play so loose in others.  I really like it so far. I got in on a NL tournament on poker school.  It was a good set.  I really didn't get much to play though.  The hands I did get though I played aggressively and it worked to my favor.  I did over play a few hands and made mistakes.  I placed 51st out of 106.  The results are at least getting better each time.  Still a long way to go.  I did play my last hand foolishly though.  I was shortest stack and I went all in on suited Q J.  One person called and he was sitting on 8 8.  Figures.  Of course nothing flopped in my favor and I was out.  It just wasn't my hand.  I was in the double blinds anyway and the small blinds and crappy cards would have taken me out eventually anyway.  That's it for me tonight.  Time for bed.    Indiana Slim

      Played my first live play holdem game tonight.  It was a blast.  I learned a lot about my live play and got some good lessons.  It was only four of us and it was extremely low stakes play but it was great to play live.  There was a guy playing that was really good.  He was cool enough to offer tips and analysis of our play.  It was advice well taken.   I was down pretty much most of the night.  I played short stack almost from the start.  I had to buy in twice by the end of the night.  It finally came down to one hand to end the night.  I was dealt an A J.  I limp in and one other guy checks.  The flop comes out and it's A A J.  I had the nuts on the flop.  Aces full of jacks.  I couldn't believe it.  He bet first and I called him playing weak.  I don't even know what the turn was.  I think an 8.  He bet big and I pushed all in.  He called and it was over.  The river didn't even matter.  It was a J to make it worse for him anyway.  He had two pair and was hoping to complete a full house.  That turned my money negative night into a positive one.  All in one hand.  I can't wait to play live again.  I have a lot to learn about live play though.  A lot.  It was a good night of learning though.  Indiana Slim

      It was another poker school online beating tonight.  Talk about a reality check.  I couldn't get a good set of cards to save my soul.  It was nothing but cold cards.  I got short stacked and finally got a pocket pair of fives.  I go all in and of course one guy calls me.  He's sitting on a 10 3.  Who the hell calls on a 10 3?  They were even off suit!  So I think I have a shot.  The flop produces a 3 for him.  I'm still good.  The turn doesn't help either of us, and then the river comes out with a 10.  How cruel is that?  The river was cruel to me tonight.  I lost three big hands to the river.  Just not my night.  I finished 47th out of 79.  Better than last time.  It was a no limit game too.  At least I'm playing different games. I ordered everything I could from Wilson Software today.  Hopefully that will help me to improve my game even quicker.  I'll let you know how that works out.   If you're wondering why I don't post on the weekends, I don't play on the weekends.  That's family time and I don't want to waste it playing poker for 2-3 hours a session instead of getting quality time with my wife and daughter.  So don't look for me on weekends.  Just my rule.

      I reflected on my multi-table game last night before I eventually drifted off to sleep.  Although it sucked going out in such a bad position, that was probably the biggest dose of reality poker I've ever had.   I was up against some really good players.  The best I've ever seen online.  That game was more aggressive than any real money tournament I've been in.  That's what I should be playing all the time.  Now I know why so many PokerSchoolOnline.com people go onto the big tournaments like the WSOP.  It sucks paying $14.95 a month but I think I am going to really start taking advantage of my membership there.   If I can start winning there, Party Poker should be a walk in the park.

      Well, that was an interesting PokerSchoolOnline.com tournament.  I was a pirahna in a pool of sharks.  Aggressive just didn't cut it.  I got my ass kicked.  I finished 43rd out of 48.  Pretty sad.  One more element of my game to work on.  Indiana Slim

      I am trying to brush up on my NL play.  My buddy, who thinks he can beat me with one pocket card facing up, is hosting a poker party next Tuesday.  Of course it will be no limit and all I play is limit games.  So I've been bouncing between Royal Vegas and Party Poker tonight trying to get as much NL action as I can.  For play money of course.  Here's the results:  $50-$5 Limit 2nd Place $10-$1 NL 3rd Place $10-$1 NL 6th Place $10-$1 NL 3rd Place  I'm signed up for a multi-table limit game on Poker School right now.  It starts in six minutes.  I've never played multi-table before.  Should be fun.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  Indiana Slim

      I only played one play money tournament tonight on Royal Vegas.  Had to watch World Poker Tour tonight.  That was a great game.   Bought into a $1000 play money limit game at Royal.  The play was good and fun.  I played a little more aggressive tonight which seemed to help.  I played hands that I would have normally folded to the odds and stats.  It worked out for me.  I took 3rd in a pretty good match up.  My final hand I was in the double blinds with a Kd 7d.  I checked the guy in the small blinds and the flop came out.  I flopped a pair of kings and felt pretty good about the hand.  I went all in with the rest of my $320.  He called me and the cards came up.  He had a K 8.  Figures.  And to close the deal for sure, an 8 came out on the river.  That was it for me.  It was the right play but it just didn't work out for me.  A good game overall.  Indiana Slim

      I thought I was going to beat this game.  Start turning this game into a profitable side income.  Boy was I in for a lesson.  And it came. In the last couple of weeks, I have been getting nothing but 4th place finishes.  It's killing me.  Me and my bankroll.  I've played against some really good players who kicked my ass.  My playing style could get me to the final four but I wasn't building up a stack sizeable to compete in the end.  My conservative play in the early rounds was coming to haunt me now.  Time to re-evaluate my game again.  What to do. That pretty much brings you up to my present state.  Low bankroll and perfecting my game.  I'm going to take a short hiatus from money play and work on my game in the play money tournaments.  RoyalVegasPoker.com has been great for me.  The tournament play has been fun and insightful.  I'll keep working on my game and keeping you posted.  I hope to see you in the game.  Indiana Slim

      I started out slow and played $5-$1 NL tournaments.  My play was still very conservative and not aggressive at all.  This did not work out in real money play.  I just couldn't take on aggressive players.  They had a field day with me.  It was very discouraging.  After a few weeks of not winning much, a few 2nd and 3rd places, I was about to give up.  Then one night I decided to play a limit game.  I thought this might be a good change.  It would help me to keep the aggressive players at bay a little.   I started to play a little different style, conservative in the early rounds, aggressive with good hands, but not much bluffing.  It earned me a 2nd place spot and it felt good.  In fact so good, I played another one.  I took 2nd again.  I found my niche.  My calling.  Limit holdem' poker.   I continued to place in the top three spots seven games in a row.  I couldn't believe it.  I was on a winning streak.  I was playing $10-1 games and was doing great.  I took an $8 dollar bankroll and turned it into $150.   Now I had the confidence to start playing the $20-$2 tournaments.  It took a week of a few losses, mostly 4th place finishes.  I hate 4th place.  One away from a money spot and you're sent packing.  That sucks.  But I eventually started winning 2nd and 3rd spots.  Things were looking good. My game was working for me.  I was playing good hands, making few mistakes and working the pots.  And then......  Indiana Slim

      I finally put some real money in and was ready to play.  I was nervous as hell.  I sat down at a $25 No Limit table and started to play.  My play was extremely conservative and not very profitable.  For the next couple of weeks, I had to learn to loosen my play and quit thinking about the money.  It was only $25 but it felt like 25 million.  That was hard to get over.  After I finally got comfortable, my play got better.   My buddy had been playing quite a bit also.  He favored tournaments over table play and I thought he was a fool for doing so.  I would tease him and tell him that it would take over an hour for him to just win $9 if he was lucky.  I could do that in one hand at the NL table.   He put money into his account and we were both imaginary high rollers, ready to beat this game.  What a fantasy. My bankroll went up and down but down more than up.  My play was getting better but not profitable.  I kept watching my buddy get better at tournament play and realized he was getting a hell of a lot more play for less money.  I needed to see more flops, analyze more hands, encounter more playing styles if I was going to get good at this.  So now I had to eat crow and start playing tournaments.  I guess I was the fool. I started playing the play money tournaments to get used to the new setting for me.  My first tournament, I took first.  That was a good feeling.  Too bad it was for play money.  But it showed me that I could play that tournaments as well. I started playing more play money tournaments and started to love it.  I had more fun and got a lot more experience.  The play was more realistic and it still didn't effect my bankroll.  Now it was time to play for real money.......  Time to go to work.  I'll post more later.  Indiana Slim

      I guess it would be a good idea to bring those up to speed who don't know me.  Since only a few friends know of my poker exploits, I thought it would be nice to share them with others.  Assuming anyone even stumbles across this blog or even has interest in poker.  But I'll tell it anyway......  I actually only started playing poker in March of this year.  A friend and I would recap the World Poker Tour every Thursday morning and it eventually ended up leading into playing for play money online.  I joined PartyPoker.com in late March.  It was fun playing with play money at no limit tables with no real consequences.  I would play almost any hand, bet anything, lose everything.  But it was fun.  It was just play money. Then, for some reason, I started to really want to strive to play a good solid game.  Maybe for the hopes of winning money but also for the challenge of really calling myself a poker player. I started reading books by Ken Warren, joined PokerSchoolOnline.com, and read as many articles as I could on Texas Holdem' Poker.  I was hooked. I finally started to develop a strategy as I played more online.  Note that it was still for play money but I tried to make it as real as possible.  That is hard to do though.  Unfortunately, a lot of people play like I did at first at the play money tables.  Bet high on nothing hands and hope for the miracle flop.  That's not realistic and hard as hell to play against.  That's why PokerSchoolOnline was good.  You still use play money but you play for points to get sponsored into real money tournaments.  That makes the play more realistic. After a few weeks of working with my new found knowledge and advice of the game, I decided it was time to play for real money.  In early April, I made for first $100 deposit at PartyPoker.com.  It was time to put my knowledge to the test.....  I'll continue on the next post.  I think it's an easier read if I keep it as chapters.  I hope you're not bored as hell already.

      I played two tournaments tonight.  20-2 and 10-1.  I took 4th in both.  I hate coming in 4th.  One spot away from money every time.  It's like I'm being tortured.  I did pull off my first royal flush in the 20-2 tourney though.  That was cool.  I did make a mistake on it though.  I tried to play weak against the other two players since they were raise happy through the river, so I checked it.  They both checked their hands as well.  Just figures.  So much for setting the trap. I can see that my game needs some harsh evaluating.  I'm hitting these 4th or 3rd if I'm lucky because I go into the final rounds short stacked.  I'm not playing aggressive enough in the early rounds to build up my stack to get me through the big blinds in the later rounds.  Much to learn. If you don't know me, you can find me on PartyPoker.com as IndianaSlims or RoyalVegasPoker.com as IndianaSlimm.    Indiana Slim

      Decided to play a NL multi-table tourney at PSO.  106 people signed up and it started at 11pm.  It's now 1:40am and I took 5th place.  Not bad.  Too bad I couldn't do that for big money.  It won me some sponsorship points though.  That was cool.  It was a good played tournament.  I made my fair share of mistakes but I got some really lucky flops tonight.  Looks like my game is starting to show improvement.  I think the wilson software was a good investment.  Good night all.  Indiana Slim

      I've been away awhile and was finally able to jump back into play tonight.  I decided it was finally time to play for money again.  I put 45 bucks in and waited awhile to choose what to play.  I finally decided on a 25NL table.  The play was pretty good and I had one aggressive player to contend with.  I kept that person on my right and it worked for me pretty good tonight.  Ended up with a profit of 50 bucks for the night.  Not bad.  Hope my luck stays good.  I'll keep you posted.  Indiana Slim

      I'm finally back after my week off.  It was good to relax and spend time with the family.  I didn't do any poker playing over the break.  I needed to get away from it for awhile.  It was good medicine. I decided to join PokerStars.com tonight.  I did it because I had seen a lot of commercials for it watching the BlackJack tournament on Bravo.  It is the site that Chris Moneymaker plays on and qualified for the WSOP last year.  It's a pretty cool site.  I like the layout and I like the ability to upload a custom graphic for your player icon.   I sat down at a playmoney 10/20 limit game and it was fun.  There was some pretty good play.  Not as good as Poker School but still pretty good.  I bought in with $200 and left the table with $1100.   I went on to finally get on Party Poker since I haven't been on there awhile.  There site was slow tonight.  They have been that way a lot lately. I played a 50/5 play money limit tournament and placed 6th.  I just got bored with the game and didn't care.  I'm tired tonight and the play just isn't fun on there anymore.  Not for playmoney at least.  PokerStars seemed to have just as many if not more players on their site.  I might start playing there more to get a variety.   That's it for tonight.  I have a long work day and night tomorrow.  Won't be playing again until Wednesday.  Hopefully will be playing for money again soon.  I really want to get my game top notch before I enter that arena again.    Indiana Slim

      Sorry I've been gone so long.&nbsp; So what's been going in my life?&nbsp; A lot of work and a lot of poker playing.&nbsp; I've been playing a lot on Poker School.&nbsp; My game has really improved.&nbsp; I'm in the top 20 in league play and my head to head match play has really improved.&nbsp; I can't complain.&nbsp;  I've stayed away from pary poker for the most part.&nbsp; I did go in for 5 minutes last night.&nbsp; It was quite funny actually.&nbsp; I went to a $25 NL table and start to play a few hands.&nbsp; Nothing exciting.&nbsp; On my third hand I get dealt 55.&nbsp; Nothing exciting so I pay my .50 to see if I can trip up the fives.&nbsp; Flop comes out and it's Q59.&nbsp; A good flop.&nbsp; It's three in including me.&nbsp; I'm second to act.&nbsp; The first guy in the early position goes all in for $30.00.&nbsp; Not I'm not sure to call.&nbsp; I analyze the hand.&nbsp; He's in early position, he could have tripped up a pair as well or hit two pair.&nbsp; It's a tough call.&nbsp; What would you do?  Well, I had to see it so I took a chance and called it.&nbsp; The last guy folded and the cards came up.&nbsp; He was sitting on Q9.&nbsp; I had him beat but there were still two cards left.&nbsp; If he got another 9 or Q, I was done.&nbsp; 26 comes out and I've doubled up.&nbsp; He was pissed.&nbsp; He said I was just lucky.&nbsp; That's poker baby.&nbsp; I pissed him off even more when he bought back in and I sat out then left the table.&nbsp; Take the money and run I say.&nbsp; Especially on party poker.&nbsp; I good way to end the night.&nbsp; Let me know what you think of the play.&nbsp; I'm curious to see what others would have done with the 5s.&nbsp;   Indiana Slim
