      These past few days have sort of turned into a blur.  Field hockey pretty much all day every day, the house, José being cool, my family being weird...  And school starts in 11 days.  11.  Less than 2 weeks.  It feels like we just moved here again about 4 days ago, it's so weird.  So, seniors this year, eh?  Let's make our mark :)  Yesterday after being out in the sun all day for hockey, I came back here and just crashed.  At least, I tried to, since it hurt just to walk.  It's hard to remain cheerful when you walk in and your family is like, "Yeah, you suck, we worked on the house all day while you played outside.  You should do all the work tonight."  So I'm a slacker apparently.  We ate pizza and I got out of here as fast as I could to avoid yelling at someone, and went over to Joe's to pick him up to go to the storage shed to get our lawnmower.  (thanks Joe :) )  We watched some Olympics then headed out, and I was definitely too tired to drive, seeing as how I changed lanes without checking my mirrors... Yeah, bad.  Anyway, here's the kicker of the night:  we got pulled over because a taillight on the Volvo was out.  I knew it was out, but we had only figured it out a little while ago, so Mom hadn't done anything to attempt to fix it.  So there we are, sitting right outside the storage shed place with this cop and a kid who was shadowing him talking to me and asking me questions like "Do you live in MD?"  I was already super tired, and mad, and now I was freaking out.  Not the best experience, let me tell you.  I got off with a warning and this card thing that you have to take to the police station with the car and show them that you fixed the light.  Have fun with that, Mom.  Joe was fabulous and had suggested earlier that we go to Wally World to get a light and fix it, so we did that after picking up the lawnmower.  He drove, by the way.   Much safer.  :)    Then we headed to Rita's to meet some of Joe's amigas, namely Leah and Katie, and eat good things like Banana Split Cream ice.  I definitely suggest it - banana flavored ice with cherries and chocolate chips in it.  Yum!  All in all, an okay day turned bad turned good.    This morning I got up early (read, 6:30) to do some stuff here then I went over to Joe's to first wake him up, and then to help him get all his crap into his car.  Oh, and I got rid of some Blue, too.  Hehe...  I was definitely really sad when he left, but I didn't have too much time to think about it.  It's nice to know that my pink bandana is now chillin' in Richmond, too.    And now I head back over to the house to help out some more.  Instead of going to the hockey party.  Boo.  But maybe I'll find a cool carpet at Ollie's?  Haha, right ;)

      From frisbee last night to hockey all day today, to watching the Olympics during every spare moment... sports are currently dominating my life :)  Not that that's a bad thing, just kind of funny since they don't really matter all that much.  I mean, they do... but, you get the point.  Anyway, after a collision with Joe during frisbee, lots of running during practice today, and lots of sun trying to fry me up, I'm mighty tired.  And I definitely don't want to look at that pile of college applications that should have been sorted out and finished a while ago that's been building up in the corner of my room.  Or, for that matter, the pile of summer reading that I still haven't finished.  Or the SAT II book things that I should be checking out.  Hmmm.    In two days we will have a house.  Then in four days Joe leaves.  The in twelve days we move.  And three days after that school starts.  So the tally works out to be... house = good, end of summer = very, very, very bad.  Hockey may make up for that, though.  Weeee!

      Frisbee tonight was awesome.  Instead of the usual 4 people, we actually had around 10, and everyone was totally into it.  Sahweeet.  Oh, and little person field hockey camp is now over, and real preseason starts on Monday.  I'm not sure how I feel about that, seeing as it's probably my last year ever playing hockey.  But who knows... :)    Time to get my sleep-deprived ass into bed.

      So, after field hockey (and graciously giving Seth Robertson an ice cream sandwich) and the obligatory hi-Joe-I'm-tired-can-I-take-a-nap? few hours, the four ladies who are in town got together to celebrate ZAREEN'S 17th BIRTHDAY!  In no particular order, those ladies were myself, Zareen, Nadia, and Natanya.  Tayn wanted to go to Olive Garden, so we did.  And after getting on and off of Route 30 (it goes all the way across the country!) about 3 times, we eventually made it there.  We owned the place, then headed back to Zareen's house to light lots of candles and watch a totally random movie.  Highlights of the evening included: - Jesse and his bubbly-ness :) And leaving him a nice note - Tayn not knowing that Zareen could control her window - Tayn's lemon - On Edge being the weirdest and one of the funniest movies ever - The __________ Hotline... keepin' it on the DL, yo - The muffin song  Aaaaand I still haven't started summer reading.  Um, yeah.  And it's rained a lot.  The end!    So let it rock, Let it roll, Let the bible belt come and Save my soul Hold onto sixteen, as long as you can Changes come around real soon, make us women and men

      Sooo... who's finished their summer reading and shiz?  And will you do mine for me?  Four books and something like thirty pages of crap to write in the next three weeks.  Maybe I should get on that?  Hmm.  Seems like June was just yesterday.  That sucks.

       I'm super-tired, the result of a super-long (but really fun, well, mostly) day. Got up at 7:30 so I could be at the HS by 8:15. Then I drove the SHO there WITHOUT STALLING and met up with Caitlin Eckenrode and her mom. We threw some stuff in their trunk, went and got water, and then headed down to the field. It was great to be around a bunch of girls with hockey sticks again, even if half of them didn't know how to hold it :) Everyone was good by the end of the session though, and I even learned maybe half of their names! That's an amazing feat for me, by the way. I suck with names. Anyway, then José and I went and biked 15 miles on the rail trail... and now my butt hurts. It was nice though, and I did have the padded, bouncy seat, so I shouldn't complain. By the time we got back to Indian Rock's parking lot we were starving, so we drove over to Subway and lo and behold - Matt and Justin were there! Amazing! Matt entertained us with his talk show host banter and such, and the three guys got to drool over some "hot" "girls" who walked in. Mmmhmm...  Now here's the annoying part of my day. I was actually going to go to York Arts, being the very civic duty minded girl that I am. Except I didn't. But I tried really really hard. Joe drove me down, but construction sort of impeded our way, so he dropped me off at the corner of Beaver and West Market. I tried to walk down Beaver to the York Arts building, but was stopped by this annoying construction dude, whom I'm sure had nothing better to do than make people's life complicated. He told me that I couldn't walk down the street, and that I should walk around the block and come up the other way. Uh huh, yeah. I walked around the block, and came up the back way... which made no sense because there was more construction down at that end. So I walked up to the YA building and kinda peered in the windows and knocked and stuff. Eventually someone caem and told me that they had left already. So I'm like "Shit." and walk back up the street to where Joe had dropped me off, and called him to tell him to come back and pick me up. By now they've opened the street again, and people are walking and driving down it. That alone pissed me off. Then, this ghetto kid on a bike rides up to me and calls me "One hot bitch" and wouldn't leave me alone. I think if it had been dark or there had been less people around I would've kicked him off the bike or something and started running. He was creepy, and kept circling me. Finally, Joe calls and tells me to come meet him on Beaver again... and that the YA people were walking down the street. By this point I'm just like wtf and screw this I'm going home. So that's what we did. And Jeopardy made things better. Heart Jeopardy.  Then Mom made us dinner, we went to Weis to get good (albeit crazy expensive) Starbucks ice cream, and we watched Star Trek: Nemisis. Joe has Laura and me hooked on Star Trek now. It's both sad, and cool. Heh.  Gotta get up early for hockey camp again.  Cool.  :)

      Well, I'm leaving in approximately 29 minutes to go down to Salisbury again for the weekend. This is both a good and bad thing, since it's the weekend and really nice out and I want to frolic up here with friends... but visiting Dad now means that I'll get my bike for the rest of the summer, and we won't have to go down for a while after this. Hmm. Since I don't really have a choice, I won't complain.  Highlights (or lowlights) from yesterday: ~ Joe losing his glasses for like 3 hours, then finding them under the bed ~ my AWESOME new tee-ball gloves that will be used for field hockey ~ "I will save you from the manitee!"  - me ~ Hearing something rattle around inside our digital camera  I wish the camera worked.  And I hope to God Dad sent in the warenty... I'm scared to ask.  Ciao all :)  Oh, PS.  the times on here are all messed up, I'll have to work on that...?  Lol.

        Hmmm, testing? Finally decided to join in the craziness at Blogger. Don't get me wrong, I love Pitas, but Blogger is just so much easier and less time consuming. And time is soon going to be a big issue. But anyway, this afternoon was interesting: I headed down to York Arts after a short lesson in driving a stick shift on hills with Mom, and ended up going door-to-door in the city, handing out Art in the Parks flyers. In 'da hood, as Justin says. In short, it was kinda scary, and really hot. I'm a naive girl from the heart of suburbia (and also farmland, if you count the 'Bury) so i don't really have any experience walking around the city. But I didn't die or anything, and I met some cool, or at least nice, people. Score.  Joe's coming back tonight! Weee!
