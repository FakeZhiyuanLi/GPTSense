      If I profess with the loudest voice and clearest exposition every portion of the truth of God except precisely that little point which the world and the devil are at that moment attacking, I am not confessing Christ, however boldly I may be professing Christ. Where the battle rages, there the loyalty of the soldier is proved; and to be steady on all the battlefield besides, is mere flight and disgrace if he flinches at that point.. -- Martin Luther (1483-1546)  The issue of same sex marriage is at the forefront of American politics.  It is difficult to pick up a paper or turn on the television without hearing the arguments on both sides of the debate.  Like the majority of the populace, most Christians passively watch the debates without becoming involved.  While we all know that the issue of same sex marriage is in the national spotlight, it may come as a surprise to learn that it is also an issue within the ELCA.  In 2001, the Churchwide Assembly mandated that the church engage in a study on same-gender unions.  A task force was established to study the issue and submit a report to the 2005 Churchwide Assembly.  Once the report is reviewed, a statement on sexuality will be drafted and a final statement presented at the 2007 Churchwide Assembly.  Despite all the press and even the ELCA study, most of us have not prayerfully considered how same sex marriage would affect our lives.  It was not until the May 2004 meeting of the Sierra Pacific Synod and the subsequent actions of my church council that the issue began to have any real impact on our congregation's daily lives.  Regardless of your initial feelings about same sex marriage, the time has now come for you to act.  As a member of the body of Christ, you are responsible for sharing His love.  You have a duty to educate yourself on the issue, pray on the issue, and contribute to the formulation of an ELCA policy by responding to the Journey Together Faithfully Task Force  urlLink http://www.elca.org/faithfuljourney\ .   This is not an easy task.  You may have very strong feelings one way or the other.  The subject may make you extremely uncomfortable.  No matter what the final ELCA policy is, it will surely change the shape of our church family; not only within the ELCA, but within your local congregation as well.  This is one of those family crises that must be addressed, action must be taken, and reconciliation must occur.  Please take the time to educate yourself on this topic and prayerfully consider and respond to the study; keeping Christ's love at the forefront.
