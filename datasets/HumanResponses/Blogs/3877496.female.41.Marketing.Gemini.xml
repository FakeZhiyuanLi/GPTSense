      You know I'm a big NASCAR fan. Well, if you didn't know it - I am.  In fact, one of my "mid-year" resolutions (thanks Donna!) is to do the Richard Petty Driving Experience before December.  I'm planning to do that in Talladega on August 13.  Yes, that's Friday the 13th!  Anyway, I was reading on NASCAR.com today about one of the drivers who had "brain fade".  He said that he was talking on the radio and just drove into a wall in the garage area.   I probably shouldn't confess this... sometimes I get to work and I don't remember anything about the drive!!  Is that brain fade?  For safety's sake, I'll work on that.  What else don't I remember... and how DID I get to be 41 this quickly?

      Our speaker at church last night talked about short term losses and long term gains.&nbsp; The business world understands this but sometimes we just can't see it.&nbsp; He used the parable of the master who forgave his servant's debt.&nbsp; We can't always give up what we want right now because we can't see the long term gain.  I wonder how many blessings I've missed out on because I can't let go of what I've got.&nbsp;&nbsp;God's&nbsp;plan is&nbsp;always best.&nbsp; Why&nbsp; do I insist on trying to tell&nbsp;Him what&nbsp;to do with my life?&nbsp;

      What a difference 4/10 of a pound can make!&nbsp; Out of our little group from work that goes to Weight Watchers, I was the winner this week!&nbsp; Last week, I lost 2.4 pounds and left very disappointed. (Brenda lost 5.8)&nbsp; This week, I lost 2.8 pounds, Brenda... not so much.&nbsp; It's so nice to be the winner!&nbsp; Especially at losing! I'm a winning loser!&nbsp; a losing winner?  Donna and I are going to the ZOE public worship in B'ham this weekend.&nbsp; Maybe we should wear our blog names on nametags!  Speaking of Homewood Church of Christ (the location for this weekend's workshop), I went to a wedding there last weekend.&nbsp; They served MILKSHAKES at the reception (I didn't get one, re-read first paragraph) and had fireworks!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Lots of fun!&nbsp; Congratulations Wendy and Joel!  &nbsp;

      I watched a show on about cosmetic surgery on TLC tonight called "BodyWork".&nbsp; It was hard to watch the pain and stress these people went through to look better.&nbsp;   Working in a hospital, I've grown accustomed to hearing about various surgeries.&nbsp; As much as I claim to want to look different sometimes, I don't think I'd have anything done.&nbsp; I'm too scared of pain, I guess.&nbsp; I kinda like me, even the scar on my nose.&nbsp; Liposuction is tempting but...  What would you have done?&nbsp;

      This morning, I will be leading the discussion in Bible Study about loving our enemies.&nbsp; I automatically say that I have no enemies.&nbsp; Even those people that I don't like... I don't wish harm to them.&nbsp; Do I love them?&nbsp; What is love?  People love in different ways.&nbsp; Some use words, some give gifts and some perform services for those they love.&nbsp; All of these forms of love are actions.&nbsp; Those people that I don't like - I don't hate them but, I don't like them.&nbsp; I'm obviously not loving them either because I'm not acting.&nbsp; Love is not so much a feeling as an action.  I will begin by praying for the desire to love those I don't like.&nbsp; That's the strongest action I can take!

      I'm reading a book entitled,"Fast Forward".&nbsp; It's about a girl who has amnesia and doesn't remember ANYTHING.&nbsp; She reads old diaries to find out about her life and even has to go to the library and courthouse to find out about a divorce!&nbsp; I wonder what I would find out about myself if I didn't know me.&nbsp; If I woke up in my house and didn't know who&nbsp; I was.&nbsp; I have lots of pictures of family and friends, I have a hideously messy basement, there is NO food in my refrigerator.&nbsp; I would probably be as amazed as I am now that I wrote down all my Weight Watchers points last week and still only lost 2.4 pounds! Would I know that I have to teach "The Sisters" class on Sunday and I haven't read my chapter?&nbsp; Oooops.... gotta go catch up on my reading!!!!!!!!!

      Our ladies ministry at church, WWF (Women Working In Faith) was sponsoring a school supplies drive for our community.&nbsp; We usually plan a little activity to add some fun.&nbsp; Bowling For Bloomers (a drive for underwear for our abused women and children's charity) went over so well, we thought we'd try Bowling For Backpacks.&nbsp; The fun of Bowling For Bloomers was watching the face of the gentlemen making the announcements that Sunday!&nbsp; Anyway, Donna and I were the only ones who showed up to bowl.&nbsp; Our friend, Sharon, came later but we had left.&nbsp; So, we automatically started thinking of things we had done wrong, not enough publicity, announcing the wrong date... but you know, it's not about me.&nbsp; Other people may actually have lives that include activities other than the ones I have a part in planning! &nbsp; ...could it be that the women don't want to be a part of something called WWF?&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Things I'm thankful for today:   A wonderful time of worship at CrossBridge  A wonderful friend with whom I shared that worship time  The beautiful, sunny sky  Lunch for only 6 points, maybe less  A 13 -3 win for the Underwood All-Stars  2 triples by my favorite All-Star  An awesome God who&nbsp; gives all these gifts

      It's payday!&nbsp; Every couple of weeks I get that reminder that I'm doing a good job.&nbsp; Not only do I like rules, as I have previously stated, I like prizes!&nbsp; I go to the mailbox, first thing, when I get home.&nbsp; I even flip through the sales papers.&nbsp; If it is in my box, I'm glad to get it! &nbsp; I like the little paydays that God sends us.&nbsp; Everyday, there is something to remind me of how much he thinks of me.&nbsp; Sometimes I get funny things, sometimes beautiful things - I even get those prizes that you think you would return if you could.&nbsp; I only have to go outside to see the pecan tree to know that God is here.&nbsp; I can lie back in my hammock and the leaves are so thick I can hardly see the sky.&nbsp; Even in this miserably hot, humid weather, I get a reprieve when I go to the hammock. &nbsp; Today's payday was an "attagirl" from my boss&nbsp; (well-deserved, of course).&nbsp; I'm going to start looking for more paydays from God, all the while keeping my eye on the prize - the BIG prize!

      I like rules.  That way I can prove how much better I am than anyone else.  The sign at the store, "No shoes, No shirt, No service"... I know who should and shouldn't be there.  I like that.  By the way, I ALWAYS follow those rules!  The second "mid-year resolution" I'm working on is to weigh 130 pounds or less by September 15.  Today, I re-joined Weight Watchers.  They've got rules - I love it.  I have a piece of paper to mark off my points... I have proof that I'm following the rules.  Growing up, I followed the rules.  Oh, I had a really sassy mouth but technically, I followed the rules. With rules, you know just how far you can go.  I'm struggling with my love for rules in my spiritual life.  I know that God has rules and I want to obey them.  It's the human rules that are bugging me. When you've grown up with God's rules and human rules together, it's hard to know the difference.  I'm trying to be a better student and to know God's way, I just worry sometimes when I break a  "people" rule.    I know that God forgives me when I get all caught up and I hope that the followers of the "people" rules will, too.

      I've had a yucky sort of day.  I just didn't feel very "Terri".  The mirror I bought to go in my remodled bathroom is too big.  I went to Lowe's to look for another mirror and I just felt like quitting!  You know that email about resigning from "Adulthood"?  That was me - I wanted someone to come to Lowe's and pick me up!  I just received a phone call from my very favorite 10-year old boy.  The Underwood All Stars have made it to the Dixie Youth State Tournament!  I am so excited - my pity party is over!  Why? Because I got to hear all of the excitement of someone who doesn't know anything about resigning from adulthood!  He's so excited because the team gets to stay at the Best Western - Woo Hoo!  He went 1 for 2 with a double that would've been a triple if Billy hadn't missed third!  If Saturday comes, I'll be at the ball field cheering for my favorite pitcher/3rd baseman in the whole world.

      As a would be princess, I have always wanted a crown.  Today I got one - in my mouth!  My mouth hurts and my tongue gets in the way.  The dentist even said that I could have a "Doctor Approved" dinner of ice cream.  First of all, I can't open my mouth big enough for the spoon and secondly, I can't taste because my tongue is numb!  I should be more specific in my wishes... a crown for the top of my head, not IN my head!  I'll just wait for that crown in eternity. You know, I am royalty... I'm in the family of the King!

      Well, I THOUGHT I posted earlier... I guess I have a lot to learn about blogging!  In the unlikely event the other post ever shows up, I will have VERY similar postings for today!  As I mentioned earlier, I had been challenged to make some "mid-year" resolutions.  Starting a blog was one of them... Ta Da!  One down, two to go!  I'm looking forward to making new friends here but am also comforted in the fact that no one (well SOMEONE) knows I'm doing this.  If you happen to accidentally find me here, let me know a little about yourself.  And about the title, I've been a Princess Wannabe from way back!  It's too bad all this "Princess" stuff wasn't around when I was younger.  It's a little odd to have all the "stuff" at my age.  So I enjoy a little attention... I'm still "good people".  I'll be SO embarrassed if that original post shows up and I look like a doofus!

      This has been a gorgeouss day!  I cleaned and cleaned.  I washed the car.  I trimmed some shrubs.  I went to the library.  I ate some watermelon... an all around beautiful day!  The funniest thing...  while going back over my lesson for Sunday School, I had to laugh at myself.  Sometimes, you don't see things until hindsight.  My lesson this week is on "Storing Up Treasures".  At first reading, I thought that this really didn't apply to me... I'm not the "treasure" type of person.  This morning, as I was reading I saw a little of myself!  Oh, I don't think my heart is in my treasure but I DID sign on as a home show consultant to "earn a little extra money"!  I was about to tell you the real reason but... I just realized it's about treasures!  I REALLY wanted that set of dishes and I'd rather work it off than pay it off.  I already have perfectly good dishes!  Am I the rich young ruler!!!!!!!!!!!

      My friend, Dave, died yesterday.  He was 33.  He didn't know he was going to die - none of us do.  He has been remembered so fondly by all who knew him.  There has been such an outpouring of affection in his memory.  I hope he knew how much we all loved him... I think he did.

      I think that I shall never see    A poem lovely as a tree.      A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the sweet earth's flowing breast;      A tree that looks at God all day,  And lifts her leafy arms to pray;     A tree that may in summer wear A nest of robins in her hair;      Upon whose bosom snow has lain; Who intimately lives with rain.      Poems are made by fools like me, But only God can make a tree.   Joyce Kilmer. 1886–1918  I live in an older neighborhood, most of the homes are at least 50 years old.  Yesterday, I met the gentleman who bought the house next to me.  He said that he purchased it for rental property.  A light went off in my head at that time but, his conversation assured me that he would keep up the property.  Today, as I pulled in my driveway, I noticed that things were different.  All of the trees in the front yard and all but one in the back yard have been removed.  My view just isn't the same.  I thought of how long those trees had been there.  It would take forever to grow trees of that size again.  I can almost picture God just shaking his head over the destruction of his creation and then I thought about how disappointed he must be with me at times.  I'm so greatful for the grace he has given me - and the man who cut down his trees!  I pray He'll help me have more grace.

      I had set out this morning to write about my day.  Sort of a diary of my activities... just to be accountable of my time.  When I interviewed for my job, I asked what a "normal" day would consist of and after a time of laughter, I was told that there was no "normal".   This morning I had to take some food to our Adopt-A-School partner and then thought that I would get back to my normal day.  One of our Auxiliary ladies came to tell me that another of the Auxiliary ladies was in CCU and that I should go see her.  I walked over there and when I left, there was a fire drill and by the time I got back to my office, our courier had come in with some complaints.   Now, I'm at home for a little Terri Time.  I won't continue with my "day in the life" story.   I was hoping for a little more "normal".

      My 4-year-old nephew stayed with me this weekend.  I always look forward to Baby Dalton weekends. (I have to leave off the Baby from now on)  Because I live alone, I cherish the TOTAL silence in my house.  Sometimes, I don't even turn on the TV!  Silence was banished from my house and I am in awe of  urlLink Stephanie  and  urlLink Clarissa .  I only had to entertain one child!  Things I learned:   There is no need to wear a watch.  It doesn't matter what time it is or how long it's taking!  Don't anticipate food choices - it's not ALWAYS raviolli!  Spurs are appropriate church attire.  There is no limit on the number of times you can play race cars.  The rules of baseball are open to interpretation.  The restroom at the pool is always too far away! (But, we made it!)  Sometimes ordinary words are just hiliarious when they come out of a preschooler's mouth.  There is nothing like having your arm and hand kissed through the worship  service.  Total silence isn't what it's cracked up to be.

      I spoke in an update about how some people have REAL problems.  I was taking school supplies to a local children's charity, which also houses the only United Way Food Bank in our area.  There were 3 families waiting in the hot sun for food.  Now  urlLink DJG  , her daughter, and I have worked at this food bank preparing the bags of food that are given out and it's not a lot.  They don't get the fun food. When I called back later in the afternoon, the secretary told me that they had served 121 families and the day wasn't over.   Here I am paying $11 a week to attend Weight Watchers because I've been eating too much and there are folks who get one bag a month from a food bank.  I know that they get food from other sources but it hurts my heart to see children that don't get Oreo's and Hawaiian Punch!  Visit your local food bank and take your children.  It's a humbling and eye-opening experience

      The Richard Petty Driving Experience at Talladega is full for next Friday!!  Oh well, I'll just go another time.  My brother would've wanted to go with me anyway.  I prayed today to have the best day ever and to help someone else have the best day ever!  So I'm gonna get out there and look for someone who needs a great day!  If your day isn't starting out good, come to Alabama - I'll be looking for you!

      Tonight, I helped do athletic physicals for our area schools.  Since I'm not clinical, I got to weigh the athletes.  Just for fun, I would try to guess the athletes' weight... I'll never get a job at the county fair!  I got a little cocky and told one of the guys to guess my age but, take off 5 years so he wouldn't hurt my feelings.  He guessed 35!!!!!!  It was like a knife straight to the heart - It's so terrible to think you're cool and then finally realize that you're old!   I still had a lot of fun and got much better on guessing weight.  Notice that I asked for the guy to guess my age and not my weight!  I was not the big loser at WW today - That's ok, I'll get 'em next week!  Football season is upon  us.  Go watch a high school football game, just the sound of the drums will take you back to the glory days.

       urlLink DJG  and I are in charge of games at Wednesday Camp (Mid-week fun for the kids at church).  We've played FAITH (a spin on BINGO), Bible Baseball, a balloon popping trivia game... I need some help!  Our next night for games is August 18.  Bring on the ideas.  We have 15 minutes with 3-5th graders and 15 minutes with K-2.     This year, our Bible School isn't even serving red Kool-Aid!  Isn't that just wrong?   It can't be that they're afraid we'll stain the carpet... my broken nose took care of that!
