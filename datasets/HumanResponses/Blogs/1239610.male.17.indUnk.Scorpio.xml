      FUCK THAT. I'm really annoyed just now. Spent about 20 mins typing you out a story and got a fucking error when I tried to post it. sfuiewghrhjyklosd. Included in there somewhere was that I'm not going to tell you what I was writing about on the 16th. This is because it would be cruel to someone who is higher up on my list of people not to be cruel to list than my readership here (Bunty Hoven and Tam Kite).  The other I'll try to condense. Fuckers. It was a good story too, I made an effort with my writing skills.  Haldo and myself in Glasgow Central, 5:30 on a Saturday afternoon. Haldo notices jakey guy who let's his dog jump up on people. The guy comes up to us asking for �2. I give him �1 to get rid of him, he looked the persistent type. Haldo gave him 80p. He then decided he needs �3 and asks me for more. I tell him I only have notes left. He makes a big deal about how I shouldn't say that to people in the toon, as they'd be away with my notes and my "denims" (I had bought jeans). This is probably true, but he shouldn't be giving me lessons in what to say, I had just given him a pound coin, which makes him a beggar. He starts walking away while rambling about this and I smile, a friendly smile of acknowledgement, meaning "aye, I'm listening".  He, being the uneducated unemployed shitty jakey life type, took this the wrong way and said something along the lines of "wit, ye hink am jokin? want to see it happen joost now, want to see it in action?". I got pissed off and told him "git tae fuck". Not a wise thing to say, I know,  but he was lucky to get a pound off me now he's starting a fight...  He tells me I shouldn't be making trouble with people in the toon, I tell him he shouldn't be asking strangers for money. During this his partner joins the scene, a can in her hand. This confirms their scum status. Afternoon in Glasgow Central station, he gets pished, let's his dog jump on people, begs for money, then tries to square up to me. Stupid cunt. Felt like telling him to go make something of his life, learn how to fucking count or something.  If it did come to a fight I would have wrecked his jakey baws. He was a wee cunt. I was going to stand up cause I would have towered over his malnourished, scurvy-stricken, midget figure.Haldo said he was more concerned about his dog attacking us, but he couldny even get his dog to sit down. I could have taken the dog aswell, but. In fact, fuck it, I could take all of yies. Come ahead, line up (ahah that is in reference to the incident on the 16th, not sure how those who haven't hard the story will interpret it).  He eventually fucked off, spouting pish as he left. The innocent bystanders shook their heads in digust. I won.  The end.

      Ok I've converted my news page to a blogger hing. It maybe lacks the pathetic charm of the  urlLink old one  but it's quicker and easier to do so maybe you'll get more updates. Maybe.

      16/2/03  Ahhh where to start. I'm not actually going to report it just now, can't be arsed. Let's just say that someone made a complete arse of himself. That someone is not me. Hahaha, it's been quite a fun night, great how we can see the funny side of such a negative.....eeehmmm situation (we being Mingi, Haldo, Poutney and myself). Words of the night: psychotic, bullshit, Dawson, OTT, ahaha rid neck. I'll tell you another time.

      10/2/03  Who the fuck is  urlLink this  ?   He has my name and took the .tk domain that I wanted. Wank. A bit dodgy by the looks of that picture...  Hmm other stuff to say. It's weird when you find you can talk to people you don't really know better than you can with people you consider(ed) your friend. That's nice and deep for ye.

      18/1/03  Haven't told you anything in ages because I've got a new pc and all computer time has been spend playin ma games in high speed wondermode.  So...you have missed...me being sick and vomiting Exorcist style. That's it.  Ohh and we made the best film tonight - Mingi, Haldo and Myself - an action epic called Shiterider. My family's half broken camcorder is in my room and has to be plugged in and connectd to the video to work properly. So we've been filming stuff since xmas time (Actually once or twice before that but more frequently in recent weeks).  If I had a digital camcorder I could put it all up here (not really...not enough space) but I don't. Want one but. Editing skills would mean classic comedy.  Nothing to moan about so this entry is a bit pish.

      5/1/03  An entry. Most Righteous. Last Saturday before school and I did fuck all, but that isn't necessarily bad. * Interruption: Getting beeped a lot on msn....Mingi is back from a birthday party pished and canny type right so it's hard to decipher but funny stuff* In fact I'm going to put the convo on here ahahah I might get made to take it down again, we'll see how he reacts.....  Hmmm I canny copy and paste from msn window to here...will find another way.  Ok, part 1 of conversation can be found  urlLink here  urlLink   The bit that looks repeated was me copying and pasting to him.  Right, back to business....  Ahaha maybe no then....couldny get typing due to other commitments. "Right, back to business was ages ago" Concluding part of Mingi convo can be found  urlLink here   Quite hard to read but probably worth it for funniness...haven't read through them so they might come down if there is any badmouthing or secrets.  So....first thing I was talking about....I could have went to Privilege tonight. Thought we were never going back because last time it was empty and shite. Chose not to go on the basis of that memory. Was still hoping to go out after and have a happy last weekend but didn't happen. Other thing about Privi is that it's the under 18's. I want to go to overs...either that or a pub. Not saying this because I'm an alchy, not yet, just think more fun can be had with drink involved. Spending hours at Privi can be tedious and give me a sare back ....nothing is helped by only 1 out of every 20 lassies being decent looking. When I say decent looking I mean stunnin really. Don't think it's worth it, asking to meet semi nice ones (people who know me will say midget girl midget baws but she was a wan off)...and too many of them have ned syndrome.  People probably hink I'm a weirdo because of this (other reasons too, but concentrating on this), but what's so good about kissing some bird that's only half-decent looking....at the end of the day I don't value kissing anyone that highly in my list of fantasies...it should just be leading on to better things. And if it leads onto better things then I want it to be with a sexy bitch and not some wee ned lassie.  I'm shite at putting all this into words. Inappropriate time for Mingi to sign back in too....  Back again. Not uploading that conversation, wasn't exciting enough. Time is 02:56...it's actually the 6th...I've did this with every other entry too. Never mind. Stop it! Yes!   It all boils down to this: I want a shag. Mmmm dunno if I want to go into more detail here....reading over the rest, most of this entry might have to go incase I've crossed the line of good taste.   In fact. Here is the line _____________________________ and look I've just crossed it. That means I can say GIES A TITFUCK PRONTO.  Any other news? Meant to have read a full book for English, Sunset Song. Hahaha. That isn't news. Canny think of anything.  Not tired enough for bed. Might be a funny film on. Top Dog with Chuck Norris is actually on...but I taped that last time for comedy purposes and remember it too well. Fuf.

      2/1/03  Haven't said anything for a while and for that I apologise. Here is an apology poem:                                                                                                            The sky is blue,                                                       The grass is green,                                                         NO!!!!!

      27/12/02  Christmas dinner was tasty of course.  Boxing day party turned out to be some walking about. Fun, though, some insightful conversations. (Aye that's right, about time too, and if you think it's gay to say anything like "insightful conversations" then fuck you, matey).  Had a fun time at auntie's gathering tonight. Whisky tastes like very strong piss. Maybe it has to be mixed with something...  A big deal is being made of me being drunk the other week. Bullshit exaggeration and I'm not having it: Leaned on a gate = fell over a gate and pished my pants. I know it's good to tell funny stories but it's annoying how a reputation can be made out of stretched truth.   I'm trying to keep a balance between using my English skills and typing the way I talk. It stops me from explaining myself fully but I don't want to appear like a wanky wank-boy. See I can't even explain wanky wank-boy without going into namby pamby detail.  I just tried to smoke hash there for some reason. In an odd mood. Always Insisted that I fucking wouldn't, too, cause I know I hate smoke in my throat. Didny work of course, just had a bit of a coughing fit, Lianna (sister) is confused and doesn't know "what's wrong with me". I'll have a piece on dope or something another time.  Know what I hate? Trying to talk to someone who constantly wants you to be jealous of them with everything they say. I always try to say some negative things and not ever boast because it just makes you look like a dick. But a lot of people I've spoke  to recently do it all the time. I'm not giving examples...maybe they will read this and calm down a bit.  Cock piss partridge aahaha if I wisny knackered I'd put on the I'm Alan Partridge dvd, but instead I'll go sleep in my new bed. (yassss this isn't boasting, unless you get jealous of people's beds...).  Problem is, my dad is completely pished and I think he might have crashed in my room. If he is in my bed he's fucking dead. What a shitter that would be, finally get a new bed and ma dad rubs his hairy arse all over it.   Hmm need to end on a happy note. Saturday night hopefully will be fun. Think I'll spend some of my money, fed up keeping a hold of it. Radical (!!!).

      24/12/02  Christmas Eve. Exciting...if you're getting any fucking gifts....need to wait until Friday. Will get some clothes and stuff tomorrow I suppose. Dinner will be good, mind.   Yesterday McParland told me that he is banned from having people stay at his bit because when I stayed I was too pished. Horseshit - I wasn't that bad, fell off a chair but we can blame that on the bottle his dad handed to me...even still I was sensible. Ya bastards.  Possible party on boxing day...maybe funny stories to report.  I'm still making an effort with the news bit look at this. Considering nobody is ever going to read it. Spank ma arse.

      23/12/02  This is a news page. I hivny a clue how to do fancy scrollbars and pish so I'm just going to type it and stick old bits elsewhere when I run out of space.  News: You're a scutter with skitters. Nah I canny be arsed doing this. We'll see how often it gets updated. Hmmm if there are funny stories they can go here. See ye.

      I'm quite shite at being angry when I know I should be. At my best when it's an uncalledfor loss of temper. I quite want some excitement tonight but the chances are it won't happen, I'll end up spending the rest of the weekend getting annoyed at the thought of school next week. Ya bastards. Entertain me.

      Someone go to T In The Park with me, for fuck's sake. People just agree to go with me to be friendly, not realising I'm actually wanting it to happen. None of my favourites going as yet but the music isn't everything...it's a music festival aye, but you know what I'm trying to say...would be a great laugh. Excuses: no money, not allowed, widny like it. goin on holiday. Fuck yies. This summer will be a jobby if a don't go, and I'm not going maself, not unless there's someone I canny miss then I'd consider it. I've been twice in a tent with ma dad, my sister and her pals somewhere nearby. The problem isn't my dad - he just gets completely wrecked and disappears for the weekend - but having no cunt to talk to for long periods. There are so many hilarious sights too and nobody to piss maself with. Hence proven. Some fucker get a ticket.

      Haldo's big brother bought a digital camera, so the chances are we'll end up taking pictures and I'll put them all up on here for yies to gawk at. Ya pervs.  Need a digital camcorder but...or a way to get our brilliant videos from the shit camcorder to here. I'll think about arsing about and trying to find a solution to this next time I've got the house to maself.

      Radiohead Uk tour of dead wee venues was announced yesterday (two days ago if you want to be pernickity) and has now sold out. The only date I could have gotten to was Edinburgh on May 21st, which is the day of Higher maths exam...what a way to get me through the day that would have been. But naaaaaaaw....couldny convince my dad to buy tickets. He was pished and came in to ask about it, so I went to site where they are ordered but he just said something like "we'll see tomorrow". Tomorrow was too late. Ya bas. They'll have to do a bigger tour later in the year.    Rangers 2 - Celtic 1 in in the CIS cup...Not that bothered really. Great goal (wrongly) ruled offside and Hartson missing a penalty at the end...but it's not really important (the league cup, that is, not fitba in general, don't be silly.).

      I don't like when somebody is left out. This gets to me when someone is actually being left out through choice, only it's not exactly leaving them out if they don't want to be in, is it? But then sometimes they do want in. Think I'm the only person who actually gives a shit about things like this, though. The left out and the leaver outers aren't affected.

      I had typed up an explanation of my lack of entries here the other day, but it somehow hasn't appeared. My internet was broken for a few days, meaning I couldn't report on the double bail-in at Keating's last weekend. I'll mention some of it eventually, but can't be arsed just now.    I want to the play the guitar    .

      I was ott last night.  I seriously do want to play the guitar. I love the sound it makes and listen to great guitar music all the time so it only makes sense that I should learn to make that sound for myself. There are other things to spend money on, though. We'll see.  PEACE OUT (!!!)

      This is cruel but know what is hilarious?  Watching thick people try really hard and fail. In fact it's not hilarious, it's infuriating. I still come out looking like a dick even after having changed that.    Conclusion: It's hilarious sometimes and infuriating others. Genius I am. Gies a biscuit doll, bourbon is ok, aye.

      Sorry. Laziness preventing me from posting. I'll only bore you with Radiohead talk anyway. Early version of new album was leaked and mmmmm damn tasty.   Something more diary-like: Why don't I get attracted to ugly fuckers like everyone else does? There are a fair few girls I think are great to talk but don't see anything ever happening cause I can't see past the basic looks thing. Blame the sexy models. Unless everyone is just pretending so as to be cool. Obviously there are some who are really stunnin, but people will slag one lassie for being ug then go mental for another one and want out with them - and I can't see how one is any better than the other (lookswise, which is shallow aye aye, but we're sixteen year olds here, some desparate).  You'd think I'd be desparate. In a way I am but I really just can't be arsed with the hassle. Maybe I need a drink in me to stop thinking this pish I'm trying to explain right now and just do the dirty. (hint hint ladies, drug me and I'm yours).

      Fuck knows why I was so angry last night, but the no deletion policy remains. Wouldn't have said it if I didn't mean it.  Back to the present: I have something new to complain about. Have a look at  urlLink this . What a lot of pish. I was told the other day I was getting a letter home, which pissed me off because none of my pals were told the same, but I didn't realise it would contain scaremongering shite like "steadfastly refusing" and "before the issue becomes a more serious one of non-compliance with the school rules". Nonsense. We were told when blazers were introduced (and no pupils wanted them) that we didn't have to wear them, we could just do without and wear our shirt. This choice seems a whole lot more fitting now that it's closer to summer and is boiling in class most of the time. Why would I want to wear a black blazer if I'm sweating already?  How about: "although you have gone to the expense of purchasing a blazer for David" - Only because the school fucking made them. They did a poll of parents to see who wanted them introduced, but really who is going to be negative and say "no it's a bad idea". They knew most parents would just be positive about it and so made it a rule that you must buy a blazer (although you didn't have to wear it).  Chairperson Dress Code Committee......this speaks for itself I think. Why not concentrate on education for thick people and neds or something more important? I've been one of the bestt working pupils in the school for 5 years and they hit me with this pish for non-compliance with a rule which nobody told us existed.  Mmmm angst, eh?

      Bail in at Buckley's. Just back and still pished I suppose. While tonight was great fun I was in a right fucking mood at one point. I was thinking maybe it was just me being an arsehole but I just realised I have every fucking right to be pissed off. It's lack of friendliness and having a subtle way of pissing me off without bothering anyone else. Not being paranoid, it fucking happened. Prick.

      I'm stuck in the conservatory. My mum has left keys in the door on the inside, meaning I can't get my keys in the lock from the outside to open it. I need a shit, I'm starving and I have itchiness from hair down my back after a haircut. Is this the punishment for dogging school after 2nd period?  No.  It's just one of those incredibly bad luck shitter situations that happen only to me.   I'll take it on the chin, though. Might go round to the shop for an ice lolly.

      Is it not easier just to tell someone something rather than to have you squeeze it out of them? If it's something bad, have the bottle just to fucking say it, because it will be even worse when the person finds out later and wonders why he wasn't told when he should have been. For the sake of convenience, too....don't let things drag out....remember it's a person you're fucking about.  Words of wisdom. Here's another one: "scrumpetMcdougalnuggetflumpytrackstandcunter".

      Had some fun today. It all makes tedious reading, though. Still....fun (!!).  I was going to do another Privi rant like the one I did ages ago but there's not point. I'm not staying in while everyone else goes so there's only one choice...."just go for the burds" aye, but not half of my Saturday budget for about 4 hours of mostly boredom listening to ned pish and watching underage ned pish, occasionally spotting a stunner.   Anyway, I'm going to have fun tomorrow so fuck ye. After privi better not be an anti climax, I want us all wrecked.

      Weee it's late. Going off in a sec for some bbc learning zone. Everyone wants to go to Privi again. I thought everyone agreed it was crap but oh well....I canny stand the music or the people but I'll still be going...I'll make a good time of it.   A lot of my setences start with "I" and are joined with "but". The attempted annoyance earlier just stopped, but I'm guessing it'll be a running gag. Unless, of course, this is read and they think "fucker...".

      Too many angry posts, some happiness to bore you: easter holidays, 2 weeks of fuck all. That's happy enough. Looks like it will actually be fuck all for the first week anyhow because everyone is going to school/easter school when they could be joining me in my world of fuckallness. Fools.   Ahh I went off into angry again. Happy is boring is it not? This diary probably gives the impression that I'm a miserable fuck but it makes better reading than it would if I was always content.

      Today was so peaceful and calm I was in a blissful wonderland. I woke up in a bed of fluffy clouds, danced around with pink rabbits then ate a packet of rainbow skittles. So so happy!!!!! Gosh I feel like a million bucks!!!  See how shite that is to read?  urlLink Steven in Glasgow  take note.

      Extreme timing how it all works out.  My mum and dad came back at the last second, just as I was leaving, said they weren't going out anymore, gave me a fiver.  Yeeha.  Got bottles of beer at McP's, got pished. The rest is history, not exctiting history for all of yous but fun for myself. Yeeha once more.

      I'm going to be a complete arse to my parents and just go to this. I'll keep phoning to check if they are actually going out, in which case I'll moan in hope that they get another babysitter or, failing that, go home and sit in a really bad mood all night. Knife edge indeed.

      Moaning:  Privilege was pathetic, of course. After that, had a pizza, went home (a tenner down and a night wasted, but it's my own fault for going, in fear that if I didn't something amazing would happen and I'd miss it).  I had been informed last week that I was babysitting tonight. When i was in bed this morning (afternoon), my mum said something about "might not be going out anymore". I don't know whether I've invented this or not, and have to wait to find out, because everyone is away to some park for a family day out. Anyway, I wasn't too bothered about babysitting but now there is a fucking party in the making at McParland's at the worst possible time. I probably can't go, and if I can I'd have to scrape together about 60p.   I shouldn't moan, I should let everyone have their fun, but I fucking know that I'll be hearing the stories for ages afterwards because that's what happens with anything I miss, even the smallest things like a day at school. In conclusion, it's all a conspiracy to piss to me off. Goshdarnit.

      Snooker loopy we were today. Not really, but Mingi's birthday and we went with he and his brother to Riley's (snooker/pool bar place). Nice time we had. I say today but it's past midnight which mucks things up. See how I'm being jolly by saying mucks?  Instead of fucks.  I am going to be less jealous of people and more proud instead. I should be proud. I say people, but I mean person.  Another Keating bail in tomorrow night (later today). Someone really should take a camera.  The  urlLink music section  of the site is all streaming now, to benefit people with shitter connections. You can still save them if you use some common sense.

      Right we'll just forget about the swimming thing. Difficult and long to explain.  Everyone is bailing out of going to T In The Park, which I kind of expected anyway, but being nigelled at the campsite means I'll have to go and make pals (ma dad will have knocked himself out before long). I can make pals though, stand up guy that I am....  It'll still be fucking great. Always is.  I might make a new front page, or at least get rid of the clarkytropolis thing, which I think has lost it's comedy value. I need photos aswell. Photos of everyone at parties. Should get my own camera really....

      Hello. I am slightly fucked and don't want to make an arse of myself so , despite Haldo's efforts, this will be short. Got fucked, not literally,well in the alcoholic sense, at Jenny Savage's........yeeeeeeeeeeeehaaaaaaaaaaaw. Spoke to some people I didn't expect to speak to...Dook, Gavin Bradley, not necessarily at the party. I had a fun time. I will tell you about my simmining troubles from Friday another time. Bye bye.

      You're with a group of people. One says to another "remember that time..." and you know it's going to be something they mentioned not that long ago, probably even yesterday, something just so they can have a complete cuntish show off "look-what-fun-we-had-in-our-special-twosome" moment. Why do people feel the need to do it? Why alienate yourselves from the group? Just stay part of it and keep any private things private instead of trying to make others jealous with it. Fuck, I have to suffer that just about every day. Maybe people don't realise that is how it comes across...They will read this and think "what a pile of shite"...  In other news, ehhh....double team.

      Haven't said anything in a while.   Hmm what to say...the Interpol album is very, very good. Can only hope that they go to T. Dan brought in his receipt thing for proof that he is going. I can't bring up the subject of T without people telling me it's crap or pointless, but the joke is on them because they'll be watching blind date when I am out ma face with a party of thousands.  I might have myself a UEFA Cup final party. My dad is going to Spain (I can't, maths exam...) and my mum is taking weans to auntie's. Mum said herself I could have people round, providing the place doesn't get wrecked. That there is a problem. The place will get wrecked unless I block off the stairs or something. People will likely be going to their relatives' to watch it anyhow. We'll see.

      I had just posted something quite long and got an error. So here is a summary:  Tez has ordered his T In The Park tickets, Dan phoned 10 minutes ago to say he had bought his. Happy.   After typing that out in a more exciting way, I remembered that on Friday night, walking home from Riley's, I had stood on a pigeon. Then Keating booted it against a fence. I'm not sure if I find it funny or not, I have laughed at worse cruelty but I feel a bit bad about standing on it. Still, how am I meant to anticipate a pigeon on the pavement? The RSPB will be on to me.

      "What the fuck is wrong with everyone????" was a little OTT, I admit. Got carried away a bit there.  An easy way to sum up last night's rant is: I am just fussy. This will be my explanation to anyone who asks what the fuck I was on about because anyone I try to explain it to just ends up trying to piss on me.  Fun things last night: Secret cupboard fun. Broken panel. Spiderman shed climb. Hidden rum. Watching someone fall in a bathtub.  Walking nearly all the way home then walking back up again to walk other people home.  My right elbow got damaged and I'm not sure how. In some sort of fun, hilarious activity I'm sure.

      I am drunk. Just back from Keating's. I wish I could focus on the positive things - which is most of the night- but let's see how this goes:  I have already moaned about this but what is wrong with finding ugly pepople unattractive? That's what they are.I have a big problem here. Everybodyseemsto want to meet (kiss) these ugly people and I don't understand why. They are not attractive.It's well established that they are ugly, so why I am accused of being gay when I point this out?? If I was gay I would find boys attractive, which I don't. I find good looking girls attractive. I don't see a crime in this. oooh I have kissed and ugly person before - so fucking what? I was begged to do it, never at any point did I mention actually wanting to do it, yet the fact that I did it leaves me unable to comment on people now, almost a year later, pretending they like ugly people. What the fuck is wrong with everyone???? I don't want to see people regret something, which I know they will, it's inevitable.  Other than that, great night =). I grabbed tits. Tits belonging to a SEXY person, not one of these desparate person's cheap escapes....  Like I said, I am drunk, so if that came out wrong, I do apologise (not really).

      The peak of last night was spent in a pub. I hope for this to happen every week.   Waiting just now to be picked up for after-Communion party. My wee cousin's.   Listening to PDA by Interpol and the end is fucking brilliant. Has that shiver factor that usually only Radiohead songs have. I saw the video for this and the end had been edited out...totally ruined the song. Fools!

      Well....  Turns out I was sick. Hahaha. That does not mean I lie on this all the time. That's the only time, I was angry and drunk and quite sure I was being honest at the time.  Argument with friend is just what happens when we're drunk, because we're not afraid to confront eachother, which I think is good. There are people who won't confront certain people, those who I won't confront aswell...it's hard to ponder this seriously because we were arguing about a lot of nonsense.  So, a fair amount of drinking over the last few days. Today should be a break I think.

      Right.  Celtic didn't win the Uefa Cup. Fuck you.  Had an argument with a friend tonight. Apparently I was "just in a bad mood because of the game" but I seriously didn;t remember what the basis of the argument was all about so it was hard to retaliate. According to lies I was sick, too....which is a lie....I felt sick but not pyhsically.  been disturbed, finish this later....

If I take each individually and add in a few others that weren't mentioned there, there are a lot of stories to be told. However, the sad truth is, I can't be arsed typing out any of them. Shame, eh.   As like this time last week, I'm waiting to be picked up for a communion party, where I'll have my steak pie then return home to physics pishness.

      Thursday was party night because McParland wasn't here for tonight. I say party - this means down the woods/round my back garden/a walk up to the kebab shop.   Mingi stayed with me. Quite a bit of vomit. In fact I'm not elaborating, I'll just say it was a night of some hilarity. Mmmmmmmjuicy details remain with me. Won't be spilling unless you get me pished to find out.   What am I talking about, this is shite. Lost interest in posting here and can't be arsed making it amusing. Maybe just need something bad to happen so I can do an angry rant.  I'll get pissed off with something soon enough, but for the time being happppy.

      People are going to Trash tonight, which is what has taken over from Privilege as the place to go on a Saturday night (evening really...u18s still). I've been told I'm babysitting tonight, parents going to a wedding. I'm glad of this because otherwise I'd have felt obligated to go to Trash due to my paranoid might-miss-a-great-time nature which caused me to go to Privi too many times.  I have nice cold bottles of Stella in the fridge...the question of the night is should I be a lone drinker or save them for a time when everyone else is joining me?Time and temptation will tell.

      I watched Pulp Fiction the other day for the first time in ages. "gonna get medievil on yo ass". Brilliant it was. Going to watch 12 Monkeys soon aswell.   Zwan cancelled all their tour, including T in the P, which means there is still a hope of some of my wanted list playing. It'll likely be David Gray or some other pishy person but it's nice to be positive about things.  Ehhh I'm wearing my boxers back to front. Yasss. Must be for an interesting reason eh? Damn I'm an interesting guy. Cor lummy.

      I fear this summer won't be different to any other from the last few years...during the day anyway. People go to golf/france/job and the sun shines on my pc screen so.....hmmm.....my last entry is near enough the same as this. I could get a job aswell, would be nice having an income. But then I think of the utter tedium I'd have to suffer, in every job I can think of. The tedium at home is better because at least I have a few entertainment options (might be a decent film on, stick a cd on) but when working.......dunno if I could stick it.

A guitar is actually an option but I'm not sure I can even be arsed learning to play anymore. Mmmmmmmoooooooooaning. If there was something int-er-est-ing I would tell you.

      Being the dozy fuck I am, I thought we were only back at school for the one week. Turns out it's two. 6th year isn't bad so far: lots of PE, lots of 'study', lots of dogging.  Taking a bit of  abreak from vice city. Don't want to be fed up of it after only a week or so. Need more films to download. Nobody has been out much. Need some clothes. T In The Park less than 3 weeks away. That's everything.

      I'm all too familiar with the idea of not wanting to talk to someone (on msn). There are people I can't be arsed with, but at least I give them a bit of variety in my not-really-giving-a-fuck answers rather than just 'hahah' to things that are not even funny. Just makes the things that are intended to be funny look all the more pathetic when they only get a 'ha'.

      Wednesday was (elder sister) Lianna's birthday. I was to go her party, which turned out to be more of a day out, in fact. She woke me up phoning, went to meet her at Argyle Street, having done without a breakfast and having only just gotten out of bed. Straight away I'm taken to a pub. It was a different pub for each point and I was enjoying myself, but somewhat overestimated my capacity for alcohol, especially when tired and on an empty stomach.   So, before long I was quite fucked and had to go back to Lianna's flat to rest for a while. Leaving my jacket in the pub I was in (I hope...otherwise fuck knows where it is), I was sent in a taxi with a makeshift map drawn up by Lianna's flatmate. I ended up harrassing these two nice girls (ladies), who pointed me in the basic direction whilst pissing themselves at the state of me on this fine afternoon. After some trouble with locks I eventually made it inside and crashed on the couch. I don't know if by crashed I mean slept or not...but when I came to my senses I had the telly on and it was announced: "next up, Graham Norton"...my concept of time must have been fucked up for a while, must have just glazed over for a few hours.  Lianna's flatmate returned to take me back out again. It turned out I was being taken to a gay and lesbian bar, as that's where Lianna had went with her workmates. It was karoke night and...oh the campness of it all. the entertainer guy whose job it is to get a bit of banter going with the crowd singled me out as a straight person...not sure if the rest of the regulars then looked upon with contempt. Ohh I missed out the part where I finally got fed...a hamburger supper on the way to this gay bar it was (not a sausage supper, ya smutty person).  Hmmm what else happened....that's it really.  Thursday consisted of me going home and nothing else.  Today has consisted of me going to get a haircut and nothing else.  Still, a day of excitement and a warning to make sure I don't kill myself at T next week (obligatory T mention, there, can't help it).

      Weeeeeeeeeeee T tomorrow. Fuck yes. Expect photos. Maybe even stories (!). I was thinking about how the people who are going with me will enjoy it...but ehh fuck it as long as I have a good time. If they do aswell that's a bonus.   Dunno what else to say. I think 'm going to go overboard drinkwise, can't help myself. And after Lianna's birthday, I know it doesn't take much to get me totally pished. Dan and T-zoid can carry me back the tent I'm sure.

      I don't think it's worth it uploading my T photos. Didn't turn out very well. My camera must have ran out because the fireworks and the dempsey surprise aren't there. It's mostly people in the crowd in front of my as I try to take pictures of bands but fail...quite badly. Maybe Dan's will turn out to be professionally taken.

People that always want you to be jealous with everything they say. Seems they haven't grown out of it yet. Even with simple questions they have to fit in something like "oh aye at that party we all went to" (that's not a real quote...just me exaggerating to make it clear what I mean).

      Meant to go up the stairs to watch a film at 02:00...  I've been distracted by songs and pictures and videos.  Wish this computer was in my room because then the pictures and videos could be put to good use.   Wanking in the conservatory isn't an option.

      I'm too much of a pussy to have a party. Or am I? We'll see...  I've been asked to host some sort of meal (indian/chink/bbq/drink) after exam results.   My dad is going to miss the first home Celtic game of the season, so I can take someone. Not sure who would actually want to go.   Think I should be a naturist for a week, while the family is away. Fuck, naked party! How did I not think of this before? Novelty genitalia decorations and wet pussy competitions.  About the after exam results thing...who's to say people will actually want to celebrate their results? Bit optimistic, there. Tempting fate are we not?

      Saw Snow Patrol and got cd signed and the like. A fun day and a new album mmmm   Buuuuuuut annoyance because some cunt has been signing in as me on msn. I've had people asking me if I've calmed down cause I was "laying into them" when I wasn't and my msn chat name has changed to yanky189 or something. I don't go on msn chatrooms and I wasn't even online when I apparently abused these people. Don't know how to figure out who it was so I've just changed my password instead.

      Going to try and get someone to go into Glasgow with me tomorrow. Snow Patrol are playing in Virgin. When I say someone I mean McParland, as he's the only one who'd be remotely interested, but even then he'll probably not want to. Phoned him there and hess in Glasgow just now. Fucks up the plan a wee bit, not sure he'd want to go 2 days in a row.   Going to try and scrape together �15ish for the SP album aswell. Probably won't happen. I had �12 yesterday and it's all disappeared.

      ahahah was just thinking there...would be funny if I'd conveniently forgotten the bit where I broke a precious glass goblet.  Didn't happen, of course. Wish I didn't go home early, though, cause I think I went straight to bed and now I'm stuck awake before 12 oclock.

      Don't remember coming in last night.  Do remember being fucking raging, though.  I still am, in fact. People talk so much shit and when nobody helped me I ended up going home early. So a good night ruined by dicks (and alcohol, but mostly dicks). Dunno how I've woken up at this time, back to bed it is.  I need to get pished and have a positive ending one night soon to make up for it, which reminds me I'm now owed money.

      Getting moaned at for not having people down tonight. "it won't be a party" haha. Aye good one. Aye come in break my sister's door and break the phone and chuck beer everywhere and piss on my towels. Because you'd let everyone in if you had an empty house wouldn't you?

      Not having people down tomorrow anymore. Carolyn's room door has seemingly been kicked in. My next door neighbour complained today about full frontal nudity in the street and not being able to sleep. I'll be tempted...especially when everyone turns up at my door, having ignored me saying they're not coming in. Need to take a stand, though. Damage has been done to the house and I'll likely get decked for it.  Going to Glasgow tomorrow to buy school clothes and a cd. Maybe some other stuff too, depending in what cash I have left.

      Right. Night wasted then. Person who was meant to be having party isn't. People think they are coming down here but they didn't bother to ask me so...I'll maybe let them in after a while but I seriously hate being the host. You can't enjoy yourself when you have to make sure people don't eat all your bread or piss on your bed. Can't win.

      People make shitey excuses sometimes and nobody questions them. I said something a while ago about stopping being nice to people I don't like, that was me talking pish. Can't help it if I'm nice to people, but those who aren't nice have chosen to be dicks.

      I want to go see bands. Regularly type of thing. It's shite waiting for the annual festival (the wait is shite, not that actual festival). It'd livev up Friday & Saturday nights. Probably have to wait until I'm 18...and have found some people who'll want to go with me.   There's nothing to look forward to at the start of the school year. I'm already thinking about my birthday. In fucking November. After that it's Radiohead then it's xmas. Maybe I should set targets and goals (!!!!!!!!!!!)  I can't say lol anymore, unless it's to smeone who'll think "ahaha" is sarcastic. It looks stupid now...I used to type it all the time. Fuck, I used to find myself actually thinking "lol" at funny things in real life. It doesn't look genuine anymore.   jackanackanory

      I mentioned swimming troubles ages ago and didn't explain it. I thought I could swim. In fact, I knew I could because I used to on holiday, but never chose to go to the baths with people because I was quite crap and didn't really enjoy it. I went with Haldo and McParland a few months ago, fully expecting to be decent...turns out I have a fucking phobia or something. I seriously couldn't bring myself to do anything other than float for a bit. Water around my neck makes me unable to breathe...dunno what that's about. I know I can swim if I have to, but when I don't have to it just doesn't happen.   Not really a big problem, just quite annoying.  More annoyance:   The other night in bed I thought of something brilliant to put in a comedy song. I've now forgotten and have been trying to remember what it was since lunch time. So fucking frustrating when you think you're getting close to it then are disturbed by a noise or something. I usually wouldn't care but I was actually laughing at it in bed so it must have been good. There's no chance of me remembering, unless I'm reminded of it by accident.

      Hahah I want to go now.   Nah kidding. I made a nice analogy about this earlier:  It's like when I go t the chippy with someone, but am not particularly hungry. I think to myself, "steak pie supper, haen't had that in ages," then act on impulse and buy one. Then I have it in my hands, look at it, feeling ill at the thought of eating any more and regretting spending would could potentially have been a pint at the pub. Then I think, "why the fuck did I just buy that? what a shite decision to make".   I do this with lots of things, not just chippies. And so, I'm choosing the option that has the least extreme consequences, to stay at home. The worst that can happen is I get a bit bored (which can be cured by telly, computer, video etc) or I miss something really good. It's about time I learned not to care as much about missing something, though. A bit of a childish problem that I can't get rid of...

      I've taken the sensible decision not to go to trash. The lasttime I went somewhere despite feeling unwell it was one shitter of a night I had. I think I'd ruin it for others with my moaning and my constant need for a shit today hasn't gone away yet. If it started later, but it starts before I've even had my dinner, with the sun shining. Don't know why I'm saying all this...just feel the need to justify my not going.

      I got up earlier due to bowel movements, looked at myself in the mirror and I looked fucked. Would've made  great photo. Better than the one on my photo page in which I look fucked without actually being fucked.  The chair I'm sitting on feels higher than usual. Theheight cn be adjusted but it's not moving down. Maybe everything else has just lowered.  Not sure what's happening tonight. I have to go out because I told my parents I couldn't babysit. Just now, though...bowel movements...sore stomach. Hopefully it'll pass. I think people want to go to Trash (u18s thing in the same vain as Privi). Not going to knock it before I've tried it. Can't go if I'm needing a shite every two minutes...

      Great night, tonight. Pished etc. Escuxe the dodgy typing, if there is any.  You want me to moan about something, of course, so here it is:  Why oh why does someone ignore logic just so they can be in the cool gang? Even if it only means being in the cool gang for five fucking minutes.  Not that any of that pretend anger takes anything away from what a fun night I had.

I want The Grim Northern Social's album but gee whiz, would you believe it? Woolies in Bellshill didn't have it. Hahah I'll need to travel further out from jakeyland, then.

And I'll be back in time fot T In The Park, so providing I get the money for both...what a fucking great summer it'll be.  I'm drunk just now and there's a party tomorrow. Nice to be happy.

      Party last night; ill today.  Everything worked out in my favour. People that went to trash didn't get in because you need to be a regular, so they come back and phone a just about fully recovered Clarky to tell him to come to the pub. At the pub for a while, then it's off to a party and an old friend's house, which we weren't invited to but nobody really bothered. As usual I'll not type up all the funny stuff that happened cause I can't be arsed. Just imagine me smiling of somethin.  Still needing a shite every two minutes. Off to do one just now in fact. I'll wipe a dangleberry in your honour.

      Stocking up on happy hardcore tunes. Reminds me of being 11, of the bus to Kilbowie, of having different pals who were all older than me and took the piss. Look back on it fondly, for some reason. Maybe just because the songs are 'happy'. The h the i the x the x the y The h the i the x the x the y The h the i the x the x the y The h the i the x the x the y The h the i the x the x the y The h the i the x the x the y The h the i the x the x the y The h the i the x the x the y The h the i the x the x the y.

      I typed in www.homail.com there by accident. Thought I'd get taken to a whore site or a Kenny Ho delivery place but it was nothing. You'd think someone would snap up a popular typo like homail.  I'm bored. Need ejay to finish this my new ravebox song. or a camera to make comedy vids and finally upload the ones I have on tape. Or money to buy loads of shit that I've been meaning to buy for a year. Or a new game to play. Or a good film to watch. Or a heater cause my feet are freezing.

      My wee sister is eating into my computer time. Seven hours she was on for. That's a disgrace...worse than me...especially on a school night.   If you read this, sign the guestbook and tell me. I can't tell if the counter on homepage goes up because of the amount of times I refresh it myself.  Nothing exciting until the weekend. Which is to be expected. Mmm work. Don't feel sick this week, though, so it's not as bad. Hopefully no need for multiple shites, either.

      Would ye believe it? Another party at Dan's. Old Firm game tomorrow, too. I'm getting some ravebox classics put on a cd and they'll get played tonight hopefully. Only need to resort to that if the party is goes flat, of course.   I would like loads of money. Fucking fuck. Jobs and shite.

      I've had loads of people come up to me today to tell me they saw me on telly last night. I saw myself, too. Looking like a gooftroop...  The extra cameras because it was a champ's league game. One of them was right in line with me so I knew I'd be filmed. Bastarrrrrrds...lucky I wasn't scratchin myself.

      Celtic vs Lyon tonight.  Went into maths today thinking 'fucking maths is fucking shite'. Teacher came in and told me I got my appeal, meaning I have an A for higher maths. 5 A's, nifty shit. Kind of want to drop maths now, though, don't need it anymore.  Hope I get some cash rewards.

      I need a new mic pronto. Technotrance is itching to be completed. I have a final� in my head now but fucking mic has come apart.   I want  urlLink this wee bad boy  for my birthday. That'll be hard seeing as I need to pay another holiday deposit two days after my birthday. Buy hey, "when the cat's scratchin, his baws are itchy".  "aaahahahaha" I'm really laughing, honest (!!!!)  There is nothing planned for next weekend as yet. Wonder what'll happen.  I watched The Running Man the other day and it's hilarious. hahaha Captain Freedom's workout was the best. Glorious spandex. Wit a guy.

      You wonder what someone is thinking when they lie right to you. And wonder why they don't just tell you instead of lying when you'll find out anyway and be even more pissed off than you would have been had they just fucking told you in the first place.

      Seeeeeee I managed it. Was on the computer for ages last night, too, and resisted temptation to post.  Party was quite fun of course. I was hearing people say it was shite but it seemed the same as most other parties to me. Maybe lacking a few mental incidents. After Cav's it was back to Buckley's for a more low key event.  Might go get this photo taken today. Need to frown like a mucker in it.

Some is embarrassing, too. Should've made this blog anonymous...  Party yet again tomorrow and one confirmed for next Saturday. mmm october week.

      Last night:  Haldo and myself went to Johnny Sconnelly's in preparation for a Bellsyhill pub crawl (aye that's right). We spent an extra hour in Johnny's listening to Morrissey, watching Jacko dvd and watching someone whitey at the thought of being a best man (his bro announced he's getting married). We then went round to Dan's where a big crew had assembled to gamble and discuss gambling.  Nobody wanted to join us on our pub crawl so we went round for Husky Eyeball Bradshaw, who was on the phone to McParland. We were redirected to McParland, whose cats had had their genitals chopped off earlier that day, to prevent kittens. The night was to start in the Miners (ahaha) and end up in Franklyn's. Not exactly a pub crawl, then, more like a pub...fuck knows, can't think of a witty play on words.  We entered the miners and it felt exactly the same as the last time we attempted it. Pheonix Nights. All the regulars turned round and thought "who are these cunts, get the trendies out of here, with their gel and their pierced ears. Fucking hippies!!". Exactly like that. We promptly left and headed for Franklyns, where I got pished. Don't know about the others. Johnny got some action but I don't know whether I should tell all. He should be more proud of himself than he is anyhow, considering he usually goes for filthy 'munters'.  After drinks, pizza, etc, we walked home and I showed Scondom shiterider. My dad thinks scondom chucked a lighter out my window last night but he doesn't have a lighter and my window was shut.  Hence proven. The end.

      The other day my mum was out with with my sister and they came back in the early hous while I was sat here. We sat up for ages talking shite.   Trying to fill you in on all hapennings here.  My wee cousin brought me down a string for McP's guitar, rekindling my interest in learning.  I've got two psychology essays to do.  Going to the pub tomorrow, I think  Party on Saturday.  ehhh that's it.

      You can tune a piano, but you can't tuna fish!  Shitey pun jokes are the best.  When I built the extension to my house, I used as little wood as possible, because I wanted to conserve-a-tree.   A Zen Master walks up to a hot-dog seller, and says: "Make me one with everything."   Can a shoe box? No, but a tin can!!!!!!  Why couldn't anyone play cards on the ark? Because Noah sat on the deck.  What do you get when you divide the circumference of a jack-o-lantern by it's diameter? Pumpkin Pi.   Glorious. These are all stolen, of course.

      I've been silent because there's been nothing interesting to write about. Last night, though...  Fuck me. I woke up at 6ish in the morning today, not knowing why I was on the living room couch. My mum heard me and told me she had found me on the conservatory floor, knocked out. I was across the other side of the room and so was the swivelly chair I'm sitting on right now.   The computer was still on. I remembered coming in last night but not turning the computer on (but I turn it on every night so it wasn't that surprising). Strange, though, that it had frozen at about 2 am. There were 2 conversation windows open on msn, but they were minimised so I couldn't read them to find out if I had typed anything. I went back to sleep and in the afternoon, when I had woken up, turned on the computer to be greeted with loud beeps and the message "CPU fan not working!!" or something similar. This led to my mum's theory that I had been electrocuted and sent flying across the room (her earlier guess is that my drink had been spiked - I think I just fell asleep...). My dad was lying comatosed on the couch when it happened (whatever 'it' is). He would've had the perfect view, had he been awake.  I should mention that I was pished last night. I didn't have a proper dinner until after I'd had 2 bottles and 2 pints. Even then it was only a bag of chips. Myself, Haldo, McParland and Bradshaw went to Franklyn's then, minus McP, to Charlie's. For some reason I left Charlie's early. I can't remember my reasoning, but as far as I know I was angry or anything. So I walked home myself and the mystery  occurrance occurred. Odddddddd indeed. Hope I was electrocuted...seems unlikely...possible near death experience and I was too pished to remember.  Going to the pub again tonight, I think. No money, though. I should be glad of my skintness, I suppose, because I don't want to end up with another mystery.

      Tonight was Johnny's - Franklyn's - Charlie's. Looks like that's a typical Saturday night now. And fun it was. I'm drunk just now, but close to as bad as last night. That level of pishedness wasn't possible because of my jakeball budget. I was scrounging off people all night.  In charlie's...usually expect it to be full of wrinkly relatives but there were a certain two, the blonde one in particular, who were fuckin stunning. I'm a bit of a fussy bastard, so it takes a lot for me to call someone stunning. But fuck...it was as if no one else in the place noticed, too. She was standing by herself. I would go and talk to her but who the fuck am I to attempt that? A lanky 17 year old with plooks on his chin and a visible ribcage instead of a sixpack. So anyway, wit a wank al have tonight man immense amazin fuckin mega wicked dope slecta.

      Need money. Last year I was thinking, next year I'll save up a substantial amount, nothing in particular that I want for birtdhay or xmas so I'll be loaded. A year passes and would you believe it, I'm still fucking skint. I'm actually going out this year, though, so it's needed more than before.   The last pair of jeans I bought was in January or February. I go without for ages and by the time I get what I had planned to get 6 months before, I'll need something else aswell like new trainers or a holiday desposit or cunty baws.  Aye aye, there are people starving and dying and stuff, but I'm still allowed to moan. At the end of the day, I don't give a fuck about those people and I do give a fuck about myself. Therefore, send me donations. I'll be sure to spend the money on something worthwhile. A tamagotchi or somethin.

Just because you might not have any specific preferences doesn't mean you don't like anything. Who doesn't like the neighbours theme tune?

      Computer has been broke for a few days.  Anti climax # 2 on Thursday. The celidh itself was great fun; more of a disco because the band didn't turn up. But afterwards we went to hamilton and got knocked back at the palace. A sad occasion. Two of us got in. FUCKIN ARSEHOLES MAN. Kidding, of course. It's embarrassing when you're part of the crew that didn't get in and they start talking about the ones that did, as if they've done something wrong. It'd be even worse if someone started the "palace is shite anyway" talk but that didn't happen.  Went out last night with McParland to the pub. Another wee annoyance. If you're going to be the bringer of bad news just come fucking out with it. Especially if not saying anything is going to inconvenience me. Out with it for fuck's sake. Last night was quite good, though. Got fairly pished. Wee nostalgic chat with some of my big sister's friends.  Loads of pressure on Radiohead tomorrow to deliver. It has to be the best. The BEST, Jerry, THE BEST.

      Religion...  I thought everyone I knew just did what was expected of them for the sake of convenience. That's what I did, so that teachers and parents didn't moan at me. I don't have to anymore and I don't feel different at all, except that Sundays are so much better cause I get a lie in.   I lie in on a Sunday!?!?!? Does that mean I am going to magically still be alive after I die and suffer a horrible burning eternity?!?!?   Does it fuck. What kind of petty wank of a God would care about such trivial things? What kind of arsehole of a God would insist that everyone worships him all the time or they'll burn in hell? Why do people choose to accept this (fictional) cunt of a god?  What if you just happened to be born in India...you'd believe in something completely different. Think of the billions of different stories, how can you be so sure that yours is right?   "It's a feeling you get inside, you just know in your heart"   STOP TALKING OUT YOUR JAPSEYE.  What about people who live in the rainforest with no contact with the outside world and its sanctimonious fucks? Will they all go to hell? How the fuck are they meant to follow the 10 commandments if they've never even seen a book, let alone the bible? They probably worship 'false gods'...a big cyclops bull with 3 balls.   In a nutshell. Bag of shite. Can't you see?

      Hahaha the same people keep getting abused in my guestbook.  I went to confession today. Didn't intend to but it broke up the double period of study...said I was lazy but also told him I went to church about 2/3 of the time. Lie. Sinner!   Sinning in confession, that must be quite serious. The priest was nice to be and trying to be helpful. Feel a bit bad for wasting his time.

      This was broke yesterday so I couldn't type up about Saturday. I was made to babysit, which you'd think would be shite but Haldo, Mingi, Lafferty and Johnny came down with a ps2 and alcoholic beverages, it was a jolly old time.  I was the pro evo champ (aye that's right nae back backers make your own diary if ye hink otherwise ya prick).   We put empty crisp packets in the microwave and they shrunk as if it was the machine in Honey I Shrunk The Kids (!!!).  Johnny got himself in a terrible state and spewed up his packets of Bikers in ma garden. He Played with his new cep gun on the floor then fell asleep. Ma mum was laughing when she saw him, but I wonder what Brian would have been like (he was away to Newcastle for his work night out).  Leaving Higher Psychology tomorrow.

      Hahah ma mum and dad annoyed the fuck out of me last night. What were they doing up anyway? At that hour.   Amazing how easily trivial things can piss you off when you're drunk. Well not amazing...obvious...fuck you.

      Ever decided that you just can't be arsed with anyone?  I have.  You wonder why are they doing this in front of us? They should be doing it behind closed doors, hopefully with a condom.  Even so, quite a funny night tonight, if a bit of an anticlimax.

      Check out ma mental hyperbole from last night. Could've wrote a novel. The thing is by the time I got home all the things I ended up writing weren't really true anymore.   I'm suffering just now. Feel weak/sick/brokenthumbed.  Should be on my way to Celtic Park but I couldn't bear it.  Hopefully I'll improve by tonight. Don't know if there are any plans. I'm willing to waste more of my xmas money. Maybe everyone will want to wait until next week.  knock knock  who's there?  big ish  (!!hahah!! made that wan up masel, honest)

      Don't know where to start...  I felt shite today and so decided not to drink too much too early. This meant by the time we went out (to Coatbridge, Centrepoint) I was still relatively sober.  It's only when you're sober at a place like this that you realise how shite the place is, how shite scotland is, how pathetic your life is. It was fuckin soul destroying. Seriously. I know a sound like a pure poofy goth here, but jesus christ...I watched these people prance about like fucking idiots, pretending they were enjoying the absolutely shite music. Aye pure euphoria man.   If I'm still going to places like that in 4 or 5 years time, I'm goin to have to fuckin top myself.   So for half the time, I stood there watching like a right fudd, thinkin I had to domehing cause I couldny handle it. The only thing I could do was get wrecked. That's what I did, spent a shitload on drink and got suitably fucked.   I ended up enjoying myself. Having a great time, in fact.  I want to go out tomorrow now and I know that if I do I'll be fucked right at the very start cause I'm not suffering like that again.  Does that make me a real alcolohic now? Or does it make me a pathetic scummy Lanarkshire loser piece of shite who's too scared to do anythin else...  My thumb is killing me. Haldo and Mingi were being right criminals on the way home, while Lafferty tried his best to spew his guts up. Motors got OTT'd, wheely bins got knocked over, ahaha bin bags got chucked. I tried to catch a binbag, caught it behind myself and in the confusion fell on my arse. This somehow broke my thumb. It must be properly hurt because I'm pished just now and it's still sore as fuck.  So.......  Tomorrow (or today): hopefully go out and get wrecked and all that.   ohhhhhh forgot...I know peer pressure is bad, but come one there are certain limits you canny cross. Maybe it wasny peer pressure, maybe genuine feelings? Maybe pure stupidity. Hahah I've edited this quite a bit so that it isn't as obvious anymore. Hmmm I need to explain all this to anyone who reads it now. I canny...ehh I was pished dunno what I was saying (!!!).  In the pub toilet tonight, before we went out, I saw a guy snorting coke through a �10 note (!). That was shocking. I was a right spazzy, asked him "how did you manage to get that in Bellshill?". Dunno why I even spoke to him. He went "aye ye just need tae know the right people....want a wee baby? al make ye wan the noo". I was offered some charlie. hahaha. Didn't take it. Probably should have, then coatbridge would've been good from the start.  Need to sleep.

      Happy xmas it was. Ended up going out while the party continued in here. We went to the pub and were planning on going to another party. But out of the blue people went into charlie's, which is a step too far for xmas day.   Going out tonight. A big squad of us, supposedly. Meanto to be going to my gran's in an hour but am feeling like shite here.

      owwwwwwww!  Went to the pub tonight. I could have went to coatbridge, but chose not to. I think I made the right decision:  pros - have a good laugh  cons - waste money, need a shite all night without doing one, once again, waste money.  I have a problem with dwelling on really trivial decisions.   I couldn't decide whether or not to go to coatbridge. Even though it affected only one fucking night in my life.  It must make you cringe to read me talk about coatbridge without making any disclaimer about how black the place is.  Ah well, fucking cringe, mate.  I'm eating leftover New Year food.

      Ohh meant to say this the other day...I saw something quite surprising. It's really quite a shite thing to notice but the use of an exclamation mark where I didn't expect to see one! It looked kinda fake and that's why I was surprised.   Also, my wee sister has signed herself up for the shite text register or something I keep getting texted about horoscopes and prize draws.

      Odd happenings. Someone had a left a kind of "get real" message for me by signing into msn and changing my name to "Clarky (stop abusing haldo and something something jealous shite)"  I abused Haldo? I don't remember what I've said then, or who to. He's about the only person I haven't wanted to abuse recently. In a slap way no in a sexual way. Need to find out what I said.   Also...the entry in here last night...I don't hink I typed the last bit of that. Have I aimed that at someone or has someone signed in and aimed it at me?  I was ready to type up about the good time I had last night but am no so sure now.   Anyhow...we went to charlies (haha), me haldo and bradshaw, that is. Did Johnny appear? Jesus ma memory is shite. I didn't want to go but had to because I made them go to Capo's and hahah what a shitey wee hole that turned out to be. Like the village watering hole in cumberclachny. Only wanted to see what it's like, though, and now we have.   So charlies was quite good, always see loads of people you know and talk absolute shite with them. hahah down point was me tryin to talk to that lassie and failin miserably. That was a disaster waitin to happen, though, hink a went up and slebbered on her or somethin. Whatever happened, she made a quick escape. It was like that hebs advert "here darlin a really fancy you so how's about it".  Everyone disappeared except me and haldo. He was with a lady, though, usin that old dozza charm, so I took off. Came home...computer was still on from when I left...typed some mad shit?....abused haldo?....am clueless here. Answers on a postcard.

We sat and got pished then went out and took part in shenanigans. Crazy antics. Hahahah.

      Golly gosh that was fun. Pub then Charlies ahaha. It's a nice wee cosy place that charlies. Saves you a shitload of taxi and entry money. I'm sure funny stuff happened on the way home but can't remember exactly what. It's always fun to be informed afterwards, though, and deny anything about yourself.  My jacket is still on the back of this chair, suggesting I went on the computer when I got in. Don't remember that either, though. I know I put my video on and fell asleep before a film even started.

      Ever feel like your surrounded by fucking idiots?  I was going to write about that, but before the night ended we got the most stupid thing ever...fight between friends !!  Theres no excuse for heederin someone in the face.]  Fuck it was too weird. And the way some people deal with it is shittily wrong. Maybe if it was two strangers, but not if it's your fuckin friend(s).  Then there's the way people can right two faced, abusing someone in front of one person, then abusing that person in front of the other. Thought we had got past that when we were 8. Make up your mind who it is you want to impress...  digjsdgnedglkdvgn am talkin complete shite here but I needed to say suhin. Can't believe that happened.

      Funeral music.  Got pulled up by the head teacher today about my website and all the abuse on it. Apparently 3 people complained including someone's dad. They could have complained to me instead of tryin to get me suspended or expelled. Bad taste left in ma mouth.   So abuse is moved or removed and is nuhin to do wi ma site now. And am locking things so teachers canny see them. Wasted. Waaaaste.   Triumphant music will play in June but, it's ok.

The good bit was when they showed the salaries of all the jobs and engineer was �52000. But really what a sad sad pathetic sad cunty arse cunt you have to be to do such shitey shite things every day.  aaaaaaarhgghghcfhifr  One of the guys on the tour was called Walter.

Don't know what was said. Hope I didn't shite maself from him.   And after that, we 'abused a fat specky burd' then were talking to a weirdo woman outside the miners. These aren't ma words. I was really angry at somethin and was saying "hurry the fuck up for fuck's sake".  Then I threw a stone at everyone and ran away.  hahaha   Fuck knows what else I did before I got home...killed someone probably.

Scott is telling me about stuff just now and it's all new...there's no recollection.   My mum said there "enjoy your ham & eggs last night?". Wit ham & eggs. What the fuck are you on about. Apparently she was pished, making ham & eggs at half 2 in the morning and I asked her to make me some.  I do remember saying I want a job and I want to leave school. Seriously considering that because there's no point to me being at school and I could be earning money instead of doing fuck all study most of the week.

      Blood rushed to my head last week and I asked to be recommended for a job at kwik fit call centre. Confusion with missed phone calls and two different people unaware I've spoken to their colleague.  They didny phone today and I couldny get through. I think I should just leave it at that because I'm not sure I could even do it. A lot of effort is needed for me to be heard properly just in a normal conversation, never mind on the phone trying to persuade people no to hang up.   Making excuses, of course. I'm unemployable. I need to do something worthwhile, though. Something with a reward instead of the pointlessness I'm going through just now.   It's Monday and I've just been thinking what there is to look forward to this week. Fuck all. Until the weekend, I suppose.   But it's not like going to Franklyn's and Charlie's is even something to look forward to. It's a bit of a rid neck.   So instead I look forward to acts of vandalism ahahah  Forgot what I was meaning to say here.  Just your basic lazy bastard moan: need money but don't want to work it, but might as well seeing as am working for fuck all in school just now.  and tits and spunk and fannies.

      Hate it when you try to look forward to the night ahead but there's always that niggle of shitey pish you have to do the next day. This is why I don't think I could handle having a job. It's only 1 wee essay thing I'm talking about but the thought of having to do it is wasting my mood.  Need a drink in me so I can forget all about it (!!!!!!!!)

      Sometimes you just think 'what a cunt you are. stop being a cunt'. But you can only think it, you can't actually say it because you have no real valid reason for thinking it in the first place it's just a hunch you have.

      Hahaha fuck.  I had loads of things from last week to write about but I can't be arsed now (sorry Johnny!).  I'm gettin told I was in a stinker of a mood at the end of last night. Fuck knows why. It's gettin common now, though. There must be a point when a just click and get pissed off at someone tying their shoelace. Or maybe I'm too tired or had a drink too many.  It's cool I'll go with the flow and take any due abuse.

      Nobody ever tells me anythin. I always have to hear it from someone else. I suppose because I never have anything to tell anyone, being the awkward cunt I am...or maybe because the things are kind of rid neck things...but then why tell others and not me. Confiiiiiiiiiiiiiide iiiiiiiiiin meeeeeeee.

      Greetings, traveller.  Last few weeks:  Went to charlies and came out with someone elses jacket on. Charlies syndrome.  Went to the palace for the first time and spent the full night in the over 30s bit where they played Chesney Hawkes and Bon Jovi.  Attempted to walk home from the palace with Haldo and Johnny, ended up in a hamilton service station after a journey through unknown land and barbed wire fences. Phoned two taxis that we didn't think would turn up and so decided to walk along the motorway in the (estimated) direction of Bellshill. Got stopped by a heavily tashed polis who informed us it was an offense (or offence? fuck knows) to walk on the motorway. He let us go and the taxi came soon after.  Ehhh made a comedy classic with 3d Movie Maker.  Wrote an essay for the yearbook full of cheddar cheese and made up stuff.  Went to another Strathclyde uni day (for Computing Science this time) and it wasn't too bad. Quite good, even. Much better than the digital fucktishitia pishtems one anyway.  Went to John Sweeney's leaving party which was pish but amusing. There have been loads more happenings...think....lots of Franklyns and Charlies shenanigans.  Summing up, I'm in a good mood thesedays (except when I go over the pishedness limit in charlies). I'm skint and not part of the rich employed gang but I think I can cope with not being involved in everything my pals do now. Plus ma dad is goin on Celtic Who Wants To Be A Millionaire so al be rich!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11  Oh aye ma dad got found lyin on the street by the polis with a split head. Ahahah found lyin in the street, sound familiar?   Easter Holidays Exam Leave ...two exams with no pressure cause am a boy genius and don't need them Benidorm (!!!) T In The Park (!!!) Summer of magic (!!!) Early Autumn of further magic (!!!) Uni (freshers week ashliratgiesanotherpinthowsaboutitdoll) Unexplored world of yesnosexnoyesfuturestopit  I'll add more about the last few weeks when someone tells me what I've missed out.  Oh aye, McParland got a tatoo of a geetar. Outside Bim's tatoo place, this guy kicked a wingmirror of a posh woman's car. "that's my car!!"   Lafferty got his nat king off a desirable blonde.  Went to a thorniewood vs bellshill game.  Went to a Celtic vs Rangers game.  I'm scrapin the barrel here.  We made the paper (!).

      Friday we sat in my bit for a while, watched Darkplace and old camcorder videos. Then went to the pub.  Yesterday we were in Lafferty's first, where we were provided very generously with indian food and loads of drink. Then it was pub and palace. Once again the bulk of the night was spent in the cheesy singalong anthems section. It's great. Every song is greeted with a feeling of 'yasss'. For the short time I was up the stairs in euphoria zone, the dj had the bass up that loud that it was just distortion and you couldn't even make out the music. Non-stop dancing ensued downstairs.  My dad said he'll be buying T In The Park tickets this month. I'm doing my best to convince a poss� to come this year. Money isn't an issue for some people so I should manage to get a few on board.

      Right. Had a little moanmoanmoan typed out but have decided it's a lot of pish.  Tonight we got drunk at my bit then went to a party at the Hamtilon Accies stadium. This was all fine and dandy until I went to the toilet and returned to find my drink had disappeared (which I shouldn't care about but I was reasonably pished). Somehow my enquiry into how my drink had gone escalated into me arguing with Haldo. I still say it's shite to drink all my drink then blame me for it. I have took drinks of people's drinks before but not a full pint. And I haven't tried to deflect blame...I stole some of your drink because I'm a jakey fuck, not because I want to be wide to you.  Anyway that got settled with a pretend handshake and we were heading home in good spirits. Someone mentioned breaking the wing mirror of a motor while a guy was in that motor listening to us.   That might not make sense.  The guy wasn't happy but we walked on.  Haziness  I turn round and the guy from the motor is running at me with a baseball bat.   I try to talk him out of doing anything but he swings at me and I have to dodge it.  I shite my knickers.  The guy is a complete a fuckwit but his pal drags him away.  I walk in a circle then shout on my friends who have now fucked off to never never land.  I can't find my friends and so walk on for ever and ever amen.  I end up at Hamilton Palace (fuck knows how) and get a taxi.  I have no money for the rest of the weekend but at least I have the experience of narrowly missing the full force of a baseball bat to the heed!

      I want ma mini wonder cam. I can't remind ma mum about it, though, because I'm too busy scroungin for benidorm money, T In The Park tickets and cash every weekend for goin out.  I think something bad has to happen to me or onf of our crew soon. Then the hilarity of bein wide as fuck will be lost.  Or will it?  hahaha if somethin shite happened to me I'd hope to continue the widness. Unless I was paralysed or somethin, in which case I'd be a complete arsehole to everyone for the rest of ma life. A NEED A PISH HOD MA WILBUR.

      On Friday I was at a party and stuffed my face with buffet food.  On Saturday I decided to make myself sick because I couldn't handle the sore stomach. Then I decided to go to Glasgow with Mingi and Haldo. Bad decision. Felt horribly shite. I was delerious. Couldn't even stand up a lot of the time.   Went to bed as soon as I got home and didn't get back up until this morning.

      Why do competitions offer the prize of being on telly as if that's a great prize? That'd be shite. Would I fuck go on telly unless I was getting paid a shitload of money. What a rid neck it would be. I know from experience. I've been on telly singing in church (because I got forced to...things like that make me glad of my 'promise to god' I wrote in primary 7, fuck yies!) and clappin at a Celtic game. Probably been on a few times at Celtic games in fact. Bet I've been caught pickin ma nose or scratchin ma baws or something.

      See if I died today in tragic circumstances, I bet there'd be a wee mention in a newspaper with a stupid headline like "Soccer Kid's Tragic Death" or "Family Mourn Future Elvis".  Someone who died here was described as 'football daft' in the headline and the wee article, just because the journalist asked what he was interested in and that's what they got. Canny just be a tragic death, he needs to be 'football daft' so people can see the word 'football' and think "fuck, wit a shame, he could've been the next John Collins".  And see if a did die. A wouldn't want to the scene of my death covered in fuckin Celtic tops and Celtic scarves. Fuck. Here lies a boy who liked fitba and that's it. Fuck all else interesting about him.

      18th party on Friday and Palace on Saturday for Mingi's birthday which was on Sunday.  Made a new song which is too sick to share publicly.   It's a nice sunny day but everyone is away to work now. Could have played some fitba earlier but I said to my mum I'd babysit cause I thought everyone was goin swimming. Just as well, ma legs need a rest.  So I'm downloading songs by bands going to T In The Park. I like The Killers so far. And British Sea Power. Won't be long now.

      On Friday it was my bit --> pub --> chardonnay --> vinegar  On Saturday (daytime) it was Glasgow --> kilt shop (the wrong one and no purchase/deposit made) --> Burger King --> train station (where a tramp ate a bit off bread that birds had been peckin at off the ground )  Lianna phoned and asked if I wanted to go to her bit for a party. I was meant to be going somewhere already but I didn't think I would be sorely missed. And seeing as The Palace has become regular now and this was a bit of a one-off opportunity I thought I should go.  So Haldo and Johnny came with me (after we all got pished at my bit of course) in a taxi to Glasgow. We got out the taxi at Charing Cross and I hadny a clue where we were going but took us a merry wander (in Johnny's case a merry stagger)about the bright city lights yeehaw. None of us had money in our phones so I phoned Lianna from a phonebox for directions but the instruction given was "just git a taxi".  The party wasn't as big as expected and featured some poofy people but still had a great time. Johnny was the first to drop but stayed over, while Haldo disappeared home (after shaggin that beast fae edinburgh in her motor!!!!!! yeah all I do is get totally stoned nigth and day). There was a matress out the back garden and we all jumped on it.  Johnny woke me up the next day as he had to be home for a christening and I had Larsson's last league game to attend. On the way home I spotted Haldo on his way to (dog) church.   Ehhh none of this is that interesting. I went to bed at 8 last night and woke up at 6 this morning.

      Hahah memory loss.  I remember going for a pish in the pub and when I came back down the stairs I couldn't find anyone I knew. Then I was outside and got phoned about going to the palace and so started making my way back to the pub. I'm nearly there when I get another phonecall askin "can you get over to hamilton yourself". Don't think I even had enough to get into the palace anyway, never mind a taxi fare.   Then there's some lost time that I'll never remember and I woke up with ma clothes on. Yeeha.

      There were loads of parts to ma dream last night but the weirdest one was we were at someone's house watching telly...it was someone we know am sure...and his big sister (doesn't exist in real life but looked like a lassie you see walkin about with her baby, she went to ma primary school) came in with a dinner for us all. Chips, peas, beans...and a big fuckin human foot. Hard skin on the toes too. And we (me and some pals) actually ate some of it. Then a thought about it and felt sick.

      If the site is dead then I'll make a new one when I can be arsed. In about a hunner ages.  T In The Park this week. With no Bowie, sadly, but for now I say fuck Bowie and his dodgy shoulder. I'm going to get fucked and discover new bands. And chuck pebbles at Pink. I've been told the weather is set to be thunder & lightning, meaning I'm going to be mockit and fallin about everywhere. Can't wait.  My pc is fucked as well. I think it's a sign for me to stop sitting here numbing my arse and go out and do somethin. Get a job, probably. Shitey shitey.  I went to Universe on Thursday, the pub on Friday and the Palace on Saturday. It's all gettin a bit old now (even though I'd never been to universe before). The sooner we're all goin into Glasgow the better. Problem is I've got no ID so it could all be an expensive waste of time if I try to get in anywhere before ma birthday.   In a nutshell YAAAAAAAWWWWWWW

      It's shite when you fuck something up and you know you can't fix it. That's it just fucked.
