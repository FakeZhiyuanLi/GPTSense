      Not a while ago, I just chatted with a Secondary School Classmate. He is Kai.  We started off by asking how each other is doing. And, WOW, he is working with Matthew. Two good friends together. I often see matthew either going to work, or going home from work. Got once, how sweet he was, he helped to carry my guitar until we reached his block and we had to part our own ways. That time, I was truly tired, luckily with his help, it helps to complete half of my journey home.   OK, continue with my chat with Kai.  Nice to hear that his 'gang' of people are still together.  BUt that does not include SH JF & JY. These 3 girls, back in secondary school days, you cant separate them, lolz. They are nice girls... very sweet n hardworking, miss them so much. Due to something, we kind of got separated, and we were like never before. But i still miss them. They are friends worth making. I truly wish them all the best to their future. Smile~  Talking about friends...  I'm rather lonely...  I do not have a group of friends which i can go out together.  I have friends everywhere, but just friends that just say, HI then bye.  I spend my weekend in church to do service to God. I have more old people as my friends than the youths.  Weekdays, i slag at home, a home girl. ( during holidays ) Spend time with God, learning to sing songs from church, and MSN!! chatting.   Hmm, haven touch my guitar for a long time.     Friends must be always in your life. For they are your support,your eyes, your ears, your mouth and your shoulder.

      Yesterday, I went back to my old school for Girl Guides activities. Wao... Havent go back for a long time, and yes, I missed my fellow guides very much. I felt so warm with them... the 12 of them who turned up.   We did knots and lashes. And 3 of us seniors tested them. It all went smoothly, well, mostly, it's because it was a small group. They learnt fast and willingly. Glad to see their kind of good attitude. Suddenly felt like throwing away all my responsibilities in my poly, and come back to help my guides, but things are not under my control.   BAck in poly, i join a CCA related to music. I do not feel the warmth there. There is no unity in some ways. Though i must agree, people are friendly at first.   Talk about my poly life some other time.   I just feel so happy to be with the guides. Maybe because i feel 'accepted' there, and also the warmth and belonging.   Peace I received, Peace I given.

      This is my first post, yeah? A little introduction of my little self.  Hehez. I am going to turn 18 yrs old this year.  But no matter how old I am, I am still Dad and Mum's little child. Hmm, always little... Lolz.  I am a tetiary student now studying for a Diploma.  I am a small (little) sized girl who stands only about 156cm tall. I am very particular about my weight though. I must maintain weight below 47kg or 48kg at least. I am a little girl, who often smiles, not that I am crazy. I believe that smile makes it all. Highly Contagious. I did not realise about this until my friend told me that she often see me smiles, and she felt comfortable.  Well, I have my fierce moments also. Hahaz, ask my sisters!! I am also a girl who may get worry very often, but thanks to friends around with advises and calm.   And my religion. I am a little follower of Jesus Christ, still learning to follow his ways, and spread the Good News.  Though sometimes temptations led me away from God.   I am a girl learning to be independent, strong and brave.

      Today is Holy Trinity Sunday. Ermz... ***  Today was not that tiring after all.  As usual, I attended Mass.  I went to another church for some practise. It was nice...    I missed him.  Tomorrow is my first day of Vocational training program. I am not really looking forward for it. I dont know about tomorrow. Feeling abit scare... Attachment in a new enviroment and alone.  It's a catholic hospital i know. I know i'm not alone, as God is always with me. But no... Hope I can start this whole attachment good, though alone...   He, he... can he please give me comfort... I guess he doesnt know how i am feeling now... He must have too much to care, then to care for me... and also... even if i tell him my feelings, will he care much....  Seems like there are more others who give more concern than he gives...  But what i said the previous line, is it fair to him... haiz...

      Today, didnt wana go anywhere, not even my guides or my poly CCA.  I went to Bugis with my mum and 2 sisters. We did some shopping. Bought mum a watch and i bought a bag.   Heh, he called me at 11pm. I was so shocked. I was so happy that he called. I missed him, though we just went out yesterday. HE just called to ask whether there's any news about some Mrt Line. The line that is going to his home was blocked, so he had to take another line. Well, the call ended fast.   My Wish: How i hope everyday, I will at least receive a message from him. A good day message, or Goodnight message. haiz... this situation still dont change...   Temptation in church...

      Ahh... Today i had headache and stomach cramps. ***  Today, I took a bus that will pass by the hospital which I can going to do my attachment in. * figuring how to get there.  The bus terminated at Toa Payoh bus interchange, and from there, i took Mrt to meet him.   There's some miscommunication on the meeting point. Lolz, okay, it's my fault.   Today he wore a black long sleeve shirt and black pants. That made him Man In Black, lolz.  We went to PS as i suggested, and we watched a movie. As usual, I enjoyed spending time with him. hehez.  We ate Yoshinoya... hehez, hoped i got the name correct. Ahh... today, he paid for everything... except I paid for the Nacho n drink for movie. I have to pay for something... MOney doesnt come easy for him... Heartache always... Nxt time, i must do something to his wallet. Hehez.   ** I cant wait to see him the next time.    Today, we talked abit more. We talked about revealing our relationship to my parents. I longed to do that, but no right time n no courage to do it. For the first time, he encouraged me. I asked  him whether he is prepared to meet...?  A question for him to ponder?    But i dont know what will happen if my relationship is to reveal to all my other friends, from church, from primary school... i know some of them are rather concern for me... i Hope i wont hurt them...   But I still must strive to survive this ordeal, of revealing to my parents, no matter what the outcome is like.  Can i Overomce???

      Wow... last night, i didn't sleep well. I had lots of dreams, u can call them nigthmares. I dreamt of anything, you name it, i dream it. Well, i couldn't rememeber what i dreamt, forgotten immediately i woke up.   Today is my church youth group anniversary. I did Sushi, and we had bbq.  It was a tiring day. i did the Sushi until quite late that i had to take taxi down to "his" place. I wanted to do something for him. And yes, for my first time doing things for him, i did Sushi for him. He wore a blue sleeveless t-shirt and jeans. HE wore his spectacles. He looked like a decent chap, lolz. He looked nice. Muack~* He comments that the Sushi is nice. Glad to hear that. :)   The bbq was alright, more than enough food to go around. We had 2 guest of honor. lolz. Not that bored with them around. Like this middle aged couple. Hehez.   Rather tired now... Goodnitez....

      Today, i went back school for an interview for committee post in my CCA which deals with music.  Well, i just wish to put the memory of the interview in a locker, and lock in forever.   Fast forward>>> Then, i went out with him. Hehez, it was enjoyable.  We went to Orchard, because i wanted to see the Singapore Great Sale.   We didn't really shop much, because we spent most of our time taking Neoprints. Woo... we took two times, which cost him $18. Heart pain... beacause he won't allow me to pay. Well, we took pretty good ones. Cheerz* hehez. I had alot of fun.   We went for dinner after that. I had that plate of chicken rice, full of rice, but only a few piece of meat. But i was still very full.   Then we took a train down to singapore river, sat by the side...  We chatted.  And it happened... This was the first time he said how much he liked me... I was very touched to hear that, because he finally showed his trueself, he expressed.  I always love him, beacuse i never hate anyone.  I didn't show my feelings to him, because i didn't know whether he felt that way. {insecure } But this night, i can really feel love...   [ Now, i can take the fact that he wont message me for anything, except for fixing date and time to go out together. because this is the way he is. ]  Hmm... maybe with his new look, he looks more 'guai'. hehez, in the sense, cute to me...  the moment i see him, my heart really melts... and can forget about any worry in mind...   i want to say  " thank you" to him...

      Today, I was woke up by a SMS sent by my poly senoir.  She informed me that there will be practise today.  Finally, after a few times of her informing me of the practise, this time, i decided to turn up.  In this club, there's so many feelings which I do not like to feel.  1) Feeling lost. Because this is a club that does with playing an instrument. Our instructor does not teach us much theory. He just prepares us ready for performances. Well, it's true, for theory, we can seek our seniors for help... But I'm not very close with them. It's psychology... the way i think.  2) "He" is a senoir of this club. Do not know why he approached me, and then we were paired. IT's very " xin ku ". He likes to 'play' around with girls. And do you call that flirt? Some agree. Doesnt he know that I am there, helplessly, watching his kind of ways... This is a big reason why I will not want to go back school for practise.   3) Lonely. I learn well, with friends around... As you know, "friends" is always the magic word when you are having life outside your home.   4) I am busy with another music. It's my church choir. I am going to participate in the Eucharistic Congress choir. There's lots of songs for me to learn. So, i usually practise them at home with my keyboard. What makes it difficult is that i'm singing the Alto part, where the keys are much lower.   Yupz, some personal reasons...  Talking about "him"...  I dont know what kind of partner he is. He cant be that busy until he does not even have time to at least send a greeting message. Ridiculous though... the last time we met, I'm the one who initated to meet up. IF i wont, i think we have not meet for 3 weeks. I just dislike the way he 'neglect' me... Does he take me for granted? Ahh.... this week, i shall not make any first move,which i hate. If he does not contact me, then let it be.
