      Ok, first of all, I had a post for yesterday and it appears to have gone somewhere.  I don't think it really said much, so no point in cliffs.  And today I make my post early 'cause I will not have the ability to post for the next 5-6 days.  I'll be off camping, for those of you who are oblivious I am at a place called Strawberry.  So, I hope to see at least someone in the whole time I'm back, starting Tuesday and ending Thursday (when I go to NYC).  So, today was oh so fun, doing nothing but packing and exams.  I wish you all well, till my return, at which point I'm sure I'll drag you down emotionally, and bid you adieu for the time being.

      Today is a bit more boring than most.  It was that all exciting start of true exam days.  *sigh* Oh so fun, don't you agree?  Sadly that is all I did, at least at this point, and I doubt I'll be doing anything real soon.  As for the finals, here's my schedule: Monday (yesterday): 7th - Computer Science  Tuesday (today): 2nd - Spanish II 4th - English II  Wendsday (tomorrow): 3rd - Webmastering I 5th - World History  Thursday (the day after tomorrow (no not the movie, though it does come out the day after this one(I think(I think I need another nested parenthesis))) and the last day of school(there wasn't that fun(the parenthesis even match up (I think)))): 6th - Algebra II 1st - Chemistry  Sadly, that is all my day was.  And I  have tomorrow afterschool, but after that, I leave school and hit the old dusty trail (ie go to CA).  Well, that about wraps it up, so I hereby bid you adieu.

      Sigh, today was a day.  I am finally rid of the horrid Computer Science I class, which is definitely a plus.  Second, today was the last full day of school, though the rest are exams.  And third but certainly not least, there was the Decathalon Banquet at Ninfa's.  As for the cessation of the devil computer course:  Evans' class is an utter waste of time, right down to him being known at UT for his inability to actually educate the student's with any useful programming knowledge.  *sigh* I just needed to get that one out.  As for the beginning of the end, the start of the half-days, it is a wondrous and hideous thing.  On one hand it is only a set of 2 hour 15 minute days, yet you have to go spend 2 hours in a single test, followed by a 15 minute break and another 2 hour exam.  *sigh* The biggest thing is I can't be exempt, if only they'd let me at 90, only 2 exams in that case.  *sigh* Oh well, it is nearing the end of the year, I suppose I should be grateful.  The all elusive third topic: the Decathalon Banquet.  It was fun to meet with those I worked with for so long, without the stress, but beyond that it was same old same old.  And of course I can't leave out the synopsis of my emotional state: the typical acceptable range of meh.  And per the norm, you'll have to wait to see if I ever decide to publicly post my reasoning.  And here is the all important end.  Where would we be if we never had an end to anything?  I bid you adieu to ponder that.

      What an uneventful day.  I start with nothing, then I eat and buy both Kill Bill soundtracks &ltembed song="Battle Without Honor or Humanity" CD="Kill Bill Vol.1 Soundtrack alt="\"Theme\""&gt (and a book on CSS but who cares about that one?).  So, I get when I get back I go to Alex's and swim with Steven and him for a bit (anyone riveted yet?), and go to help Steven with algebra II.  After that whole fun-ness I return to my sanctuary I call a room and own in RoN (Rise of Nations), and that leads to here.  So, how uneventful.  My life still contains a jumble of problems (in case you thought they disappeared), and I continue to tick on.  Well, I hope your lives are all better than mine, as far as problems go.  And on a note of self-loathing and boosting-others I bid you adieu.

      Well, today was fun-ish.  I start it off by opening 2 bank accounts and getting traveler's cheques, so there is like 24 signatures and 2 hours there.  Then I got me hair partially lobed off, so there went 30 min, and I waited around watching Family Guy(on DVD) for a while till I got bored and went with Danielle to the mall and blew about a hour and a half.  So at end the day I went to the 2004 Thepis Awards Show.  I must take the time here to congratulate both the nominees and the award winners, as well as the performers who worked to make the ceremony entertaining.  And our normal after performance dinner ensued at TGI Fridays, which was a blast, though thoroughly tiring.  And that was today, how exciting.  *sigh* My typical set of undisclosed problems persist, and per the norm I leave you on that note.  Note of date: This message is actually being posted at 1:00 am on May 23, 2004 so the date has been moved to have it in the day it applies to.

      Well, that was the last real week of school, if the reviewing even counts.  But I am SO happy that that is threw with!  Evans never go to grading my program, so there goes part of the exam time (7th period).*grumble*  A topic so important that it garnishes it's own section: Senior Banquet I wish this year's Troope 5448 seniors the best the broken leg has to offer as you go throughout your ventures in life.  It has truly been a pleasure getting to know you, as you are surely saying as I type this(the banquet hasn't ended yet).  And of course congratulations to next year's officers (TBA there, so I don't exactly know who yet)!  So, as for the account of my actual events of today...there was nothing, Evans threatened to walk on Zahid, I had more good food (from Caspian Cafe this time), and I did more studying.  As for my mood, I'll let you know it's the same as always: within an acceptable range of meh.  I have those fantastic problems that certainly will not go away, yet are not going to be revealed to you (for the timebeing).  But oh well, all that leads to is pent up pity for myself.  And now I bid you adieu.

      Well, just got back from my NYC trip meeting.  It was SO fun.&lt/sarcasm&gt  We did the same things you'd expect: get the rules, exchange numbers, and fill out forms.  Ah oh well, on the good side I found that we'll have opportunities to buy tickets to another matinee show (at least in theory).  I have to find a good one so, if you wanna check them out they're at  urlLink Current Broadway Shows , with the exception being that Aida has apparently been discontinued.  So now you know the last  hours you know the vast majority of my day's events.  'Bout the only other thing would be...nothing...all that happened during school, is I thought my own thoughts (as in they didn't always correlate with he theoretical target of the class), till trying to find what to do with my assorted list of problems (just so you don't think they've gone away, though that'd be nice).  And here I bid you adieu, and g'day to all of you who read this (as for the rest...well, that really doesn't matter).

      Well, today I finally remembered to get my VOE (Verification of Enrollment), so I got my permit and got to drive for the first time today.  For those of you who get those exemptions, I simultaneously condemn you and congratulate ya...too bad I can't get them...oh well.  Alright, I'm seeing that people are complaining about gas prices (on  urlLink MSN ) for those of you who actually are, realize that it is over $3.00 where I'd like to be (see yesterday's pics).  We're even mentioned to have the most affordable gas in the Gulf coast, which, by some freak accident, has the cheapest gas.  While guess who, that's right California had the highest.  Beyond that today was yet another boring day, complete with my pathetic thoughts, which reminds me: can anyone think of anything good (as in attractive) about me?, and wallowing in my own self pity.  Well, that's it!  Nothing else to cover, so I bid you adieu.  The place I'm going when school is out:  urlLink Strawberry Music Festival  Not sure I want certain people to see that, but it's not that bad.

      So, here's to another glorious day in my life.  For the moment I'm feeling very loathed, shunned, and otherwise contemptible.  Well,I suppose that all of that stems from being kept in the dark of just about everything.  Ah, oh well, I just feel so ignored *grumbles*  Well, on that note I'll leave you with these pics of my former home.

      Well, here ya go, I've actually created a Blog and probally will post some of my junk/ramblings/complaints here.  Well, since I don't have a box to indicate how I'm feeling I'll say right here: anti-social.  For those of you who think that looking here will provide you with a glimse into my most personal and private details, you can safely take that as a false hope.  As many of you know there are but two people privledged to that information, one currently residing in San Francisco and the other residing here, but to the fullest extent of my knowledge, nobody knows who he/she is. So, to get to my reason for saying that: don't ask me about such things.  If I decide to open these topics to you, then you will be informed as such and if not, then its not going to be any of your business.  There are some of you who I would tell (well only one really), but if you were in my place you'd be doing the same thing I am.  And it is on that note that I leave you.

      Well, today I rolled out of my bed around 1 when I got a call on my cell.  I answered it to find Russ, and after I got myself together, we went to Steven's house.  We got there, and Russ, Danielle, Steven and I played DDR (yes, I played again) for a while.  When that was done we played some Project Gotham, after which we all headed to the mall to find a b-day present for Alex.  We managed to find a few things, and at 6:30 we headed back, hitting the rush hour traffic.  I got my bike form Alex's house, and headed home.  I got here, and then I found Ricky having problems with his new office server that he is building.  I went over to help him, and we arrived at the conclusion that he needed to RMA the motherboard.  After that we talked for a while.  I headed home and watched Futurama and started Family Guy when I decided I didn't want to watch that episode again.  So, here I am, on AIM, and writing this entry.  I once again plan on some sleep shortly following this, but I also hope that I don't get stuck awake until 3-4 AM.  Well, that said, night, and I bid you adieu.

      Well, today I stayed up, until I decided to lay down, knowing that if I did for too long that I'd nod off to sleep.  That occured around noo, and I slept until quarter till 5.  At 5 I read my messages snet when i was away.  One sidetrack:  for those of you who read that you should call me if you ahve an idea of an activity, well, you may be interested that when I'm home my cell phone is usually by my computer, in otherwords, don't call my cell, I don't carry it around within my house (most of the time).  Now back to the topic:  At about 5:15 I gave Russ a call back, after which he, Danielle, and I went to go see the  Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story .  When the movie was over, I returned home, watched come TV, chatted on AIM, looked for a "Mail motherfucker" sound clip, configured Outlook to play it.  After all of that I am brought to writing this entry.  I am planning on going to sleep shortly, pending the completion of this entry.   Yes, that's correct, I am not going to stay up and write an entry at 5 AM tonight, I am actually writing this one early and planning on going to sleep early, by comparison.  With my day fully accounted, I bid you adieu.

      Well, today I had awaken at 2:30ish.  I woke up, played some Star Trek Armada II while cahtting with people online.  After a while I went to Russ's hosue where, once again, Alex, Russ, and I played SSBM and then we all watched a movie called  Destroy All Monsters .  THe movie was quite amusing being a movie made in 1968 Japan, set  1999.  After the moive I went with  Alex and Isabelle to the park.  We all talked for a while, after which i returned home.  At home I, in this order, watched Stargate SG-1, watched  Pulp Fiction , watched an episode of MASH, watched the morning news.  While, during all of that, chatting on AIM, at some points browsing the [M], and installing Macromedia Studio MX. Currently I am watchign teh morning news on FOX, and reading up on the asorted blogs, where I found the thing below.  With all of my days events declared, I bid you adieu.      You're the United Nations!    Most people think you're ineffective, but you are trying to completely save the world from itself, so there's always going to be a long way to go. &nbsp;You're always the one trying to get friends to talk to each other, enemies to talk to each other, anyone who can to just talk instead of beating each other about the head and torso. &nbsp;Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, and you get very schizophrenic as a result. &nbsp;But your heart is in the right place, and sometimes also in New York.

      Well, today I slept until about 4 PM.  It was fun.  After that I went up into Houston and ate some German food.  After I did that I went to Russ's house and we played Super Smash Brothers Melee with Alex.  After the SSBM we watcher  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines  in full.  When all that was said and done, Alex showed Russ and I an amusing website (the URL escapes me at the moment).  When no more was to be done there, we all returned to our respective homes (I think, I most definitely did).   After all that I came home and started working with my desktop, and found that it is now likely to crash at any given moment.  There is a technology that has apparently been developed to detect this, SMART, and it has failed, indicating that he drive is likely to follow suit.  I worked on trying to backup some of the data for a while, after which I went on to chat with more people on AIM, browse the [M] for a bit, attempt to enable 48 bit LBA addressing (failed to figure it out again), listen to music, and browsed MSN (I've run out of things to do).  I did in my MSN browsing find some interesting quotes, which you will find at the bottom of this post.  With all that said and done, I can safely bid you adieu, so here I go:  I bid you adieu.  Time/Date Note:  The correct time is 5:21 AM on June 27, 2004.  Yes, I am still up, and I do realize that I should get some sleep, I however don't plan on it yet.  Quotes (all of war)(from  urlLink MSN Encarta ): All wars are popular for the first thirty days. --Attributed to Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. (1917- ), U.S. historian.  The guerrilla fights the war of the flea, and his military enemy suffers the dog's disadvantages: too much to defend; too small, ubiquitous, and agile an enemy to come to grips with. --Robert Taber (1928- ), U.S. writer. From War of the Flea (1965).  A war regarded as inevitable or even probable, and therefore much prepared for, has a very good chance of being fought. --George F. Kennan (1904- ), U.S. diplomat and scholar. From The Cloud of Danger (1977).  War is capitalism with the gloves off. --Tom Stoppard (1937- ), British playwright and screenwriter. From Travesties (1974).  You no more win a war than you can win an earthquake. --Jeannette Rankin (1880-1973), U.S. legislator.

      So, today I helped with the TI "Bring Your Sons And Daughters to Work Day."  I found it easier than I expected to corral small children and get them to work in a programming type project.  Either way, they did well, better than my CompSci class faired getting these rudimentary concepts.  Oh well, all that says is that our school has many people in classes they should never go near, which should come as no surprise for anyone.  I did do one positive thing, after the event my mother was talking about the qualifications for the SDS (Software Development Systems) are and how they look for the degree I wanted to get, the real thing here is I finally know the name of it: Computer Engineering.  It's supposed to be a combination of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, in other words it deals with both the hardware and the software of a computer.  Well, that aside I returned home at about 1 and I didn't do much of anything after that, I played a game of Starcraft with Russell, after which I continued to listen to peoples and browse the intarweb.  Well, with the account of my day gone, I need to talk to you about your comments.  I know there are peoples I know reading this, I have but one request for all of you:  make comments.  Without your remarks no matter how snide, I have no real way of knowing if anyone is reading this, or if people do, who they are.  Just make sure they aren't entirely random (like the ones on yesterday's blog entry (which reminds me:  who posted those?)).  So, take that note.  Finally I have a few notes for all of you people.  I need to find something to do.  I'd hope that at least some of you would be nice enough to invite me along on some of the activities you all have.  It isn't to uncommon for me to hear about an activity I missed, for a simple reason like I wasn't online.  I know that I'm usually online, but because I'm offline doesn't always mean that I'm busy with some entertaining engagement.  Well, all of that aside, I'd like to put this song in:     Well, my day accounted and then some, I will bid you adieu, content (not happy with, though I don't expect anyone to be invite me at 10:10 PM) in the idea that I will not be doing anything.

      Well, I awoke today at noon, when I played a game of Starcraft with Russ.  After that funness we watched the begining ot  T3:Rise of the Machines   and then I had to return home to get ready for the peoples to show up and game (DnD).  When they did we gamed from 3:00 to 5:30, after which I promptly went on AIM and watched some TV.  At about 7:45 Alex send an IM off top me invitine me to a screening of a movie.  I went and we (Isabelle, Russ, Alex, and I) watched  Eurotrip  which was absolutely hillarious.  After that I returned home, and well, here I am.  So, that was my day.  As for my plans for what I do later tonight:  sleep.  I have to be up in Stafford tomorrow for some thing I'm helping my mother with at 7 AM.  With all said and done, I bid you adieu.

      So, today I got to sleep until 2, when I promptly woke up.  I then, per the norm, browsed the [M], and chatted on AIM.  I did that until bout 5, when I called Russ to see fi there were any ideas for how we could keep the usefulness of both of our spellcasters (I'm a wizard, he's a sorcerer).  After that he invited me over and I brought my laptop and we played Starcraft, when it decided to lag out.  After we tried that, we ate some food, and we watched  Ice Age .  When that was over Russ started a anime called  lain , and apparently the only way to protect yourself from static electricity is to take your clothes off.  So, with that I'm sitting here at Russ' house going to play Starcraft when I'm done.  Well, good night/day/afternoon to all, and I will now bid you adieu.

      So, today all started at about 1 (PM this time) when I awoke.  After I got up I went to the PC for some Gen[M]ay.  Then, I got a call from Danielle who asked about the DnD game, which it would seem will be at my house (by declaration of Russ) at 3 PM on Thursday, and then we some how got to talking and then PristonTale came up and she had me go upstairs to play.  We played for about 2 hours and then Alex IM'd her and asked if she wanted to go swimming, and then somehow (I know I asked her to tell Alex "Stephen does," but I don't know if she did or if he would have anyway) I got invited.  Here (you'll see later).  So Danielle came to pick me up and then we proceeded together to Alex's house.  Where we all swam (I'm still not going to publicly name her) for a while, while talking and otherwise entertaining ourselves in some form or another.  When Danielle called home we found that she had apparently set call forwarding to forward to my home.  We agreed that this probably happened to be at the time denoted by "Here" since she called to make sure that the gate code still worked, when it didn't register as "Steven Kramer," but instead as "Private Call."  So, we (Danielle and I) went home (dinner for her, and I had to do something for my mom), and after some IMs we managed to get the call forwarding deactivated (we (my family) have the number in our phone directory for the over complicated phone system).  After all that funness Russ, Alex, Isabel, and I went to Alex's to watch a movie.  We watched  Happy Gilmore  because blockbuster sucks and insists that they cannot call to check for R rated movies, and would not allow Russ to rent it without a license, so they opted for  Happy Gilmore  over  Starship Troopers 2 .  So, after they go through the problems renting it, we watch it and low and behold toward the end it would seem that the DVD was scratched.  We tried to make it through that, but it was to unbearable and we decided to cut it off short.  With the complications before and during that screening we have all decided that Hollywood Video is infinitely better than Blockbuster.  When we were done Alex dropped Russ and I off, and either stayed out with Isabel, or dropped here off too (probably the latter since she suggested she needed to get some sleep).  Well, none the less, when i got home I chatted with peoples and browsed the [M] and other forums.  When all that was said and done I began to compose this entry.  Again, i hope all of your days were as entertaining as mine.  I will now gladly inform you all that you have been bid adieu buy the great Lord Stephen McMillen.  PS: Ellen, you are about the only person I'd call a good friend who isn't playing or somehow involved (in the DnD game (edited because Alex got confused).  So who wants to guess what time it is while I post this? OK, what's your guess? 1:15 AM, why, yes, that's exactly it.

      Today was actually entertaining, it began with my abrupt awakening at 2 AM, i don't exactly know why but my body decided that it needed to be up that early.  I spent the next 2 hours trying to restore my comfortable state of rest, unsuccessfully might I add.  SO here I am at 4 AM trying to keep my self entertained, I signed on AIM and Alex was online we chatted with each other, and then we both went onto this game called PristonTale.  Played for a bit, then he went off to get some sleep (this is why we don't stay out till 3:30 AM then go play around till 6 AM) and I tried to find another activity.  After that deal I watched parts of  Yellow Submarine , followed by an attempt to chat with some people and a good ol' browsing of the [M] ( urlLink Gen[M]ay ).  With no more to do I was downstairs taking full advantage of my newfound freedom from the desk (my laptop's wireless), and while watching TV (The History Channel) I fell asleep for about 20-30 min.  I woke bout noon and tried to find s potential conversation online, though nobody was online  that  early, and watched more History Channel on the Panama Canal this time.  I while I'm in a desperate attempt to find an activity I get an invite from Ellen to a DDR gathering at her house (I didn't play).  After the DDR was exhausted for Nick, Alex, and Ellen Nick had the bright idea for all six of us to go swimming so we all (Dave and Erika (I think) are the two not previously mentioned as they didn't play DDR either) went to his house for the fun.  We swam for a while then when Dave and Ellen had to return to their respective homes for their dinners Alex and I went to Taco Bell, and then "gatecrashed" (as I like to call it, though we asked en route) Russ' house and played some Halo.  I was a definitely out of practice for console games, Halo in particular, but it was al fun anyway.  When we did that we watched some LOTR:Fellowship of the Ring and carried an interesting conversation on.  Alex made some interesting pics mocking Christianity and we decided that Alex and Russ would be smited (the spell check wanted his to be sainted), while I, the atheist, would be untouched, seeing as to I would then have proof of god and a reason to worship him.  With that al carried out, Alex drove me home and I chatted online, and browsed the [M] some more.  With that exhausted of fun I began my quest to get the secondary wifi access point in our house to be configured to work with my laptop.  After all of that I am writing this message at 1:29 AM on the fine day of June 22, 2004, and now I think it is time to sleep a bit so lets conclude this.  I hope all of your days were as action packed as mine, and I will now bid you adieu.  Notes: I believe this is my longest single day account, and this is my first wirelessly transmitted post.

      Well, this is a early post from my perspective, but I somehow doubt I'll be doing anything anytime soon (at in tonight).  So with that I'll inform you that today was spent online playing with my new toy (the laptop), a shopping trip to Lowes and Best Buy, since we procrastinate, and then a trip to Ragin Cajun for the Father's Day dinner.  And well, with some more time spend online chatting with people, I have brought myself to the point where I'm writing this entry.  I hope all is well for everyone and well, there really is no more to be said.  I hope I find something to do tomorrow *hint hint*.  With that I will bid you all adieu.

      So, today I really did noting until I got my laptop!  That in and of itself made my day.  I've been petitioning my parents for one of these suckers for years (literally, it was one of my childhood wishlist items (wow, that's pathetic)).  As you may have read before Its got a fairly nice setup, fitting of the $1600 ($1500 after a rebate) price tag.  One thinng I found is just how fast the DVD burner is, I burned all my music (3 GB) to a DVD in 17 minutes.  Well, I doubt you apprichiate my bragging, but I am terribly excited.  And with no more to account, I bid you adieu.  PS: Ellen, next time you might try getting more people for Risk.  Time/Date Note:  The time is adjusted to reflect the appropiate day.

      Well, today was like yesterday.  Spend my time from waking until 6-ish shopping for my laptop.  I think I've settled in on a  urlLink Winbook  W340.  It's go t the Centrino technology, which is supposed to boost the battery life by cutting the power consumption.  It's also got the built in wireless G so I can connect at 54 Mbps instead of the 11 of B.  The processor is only 1.6, but as I say above Centrino, so it has a large cache for faster computing.  With this I get the ATI Radeon 9600 with 64MB DDR RAM, so that should do some good.  The book was rated to be good all around.  Well, nothing more on the laptop, and with no more done or to be said, I hereby bid you adieu.

      Well, today was much like yesterday, I did little.  In an attempt to revert my sleep schedule do something normal, I stayed up all night, and as a result I watched lots of TV.  Beyond TV I went out for some laptop shopping, since I get approximately a  $1600 budget for my new laptop computer.  After all of that I've come home watched more TV, and found that the bank managed to do something correct for once: they managed to refund my money.  Well, with no other changes, be them emotional, intellectual, or social, I must bit you adieu.

      Alright, first thing I have to write about: yesterday.  I neglected to write an entry, so here it goes.  Today I went to Steven's house and, well, they managed to get me to play DDR (well, I didn't put up much of a fight).  After that we (Russ, Steve, Danielle, JJ, and I) went to Sasu to have sushi.  It was good, as usual, and after all of that we picked up my copy of Office Space and went back to Steven's house to watch it.  After all that, and before all that, was some time spend wondering what to do, browsing the internet, as is my usual filler.  And now for the predicted topic of discussion: today.  So, today I went and notified the bank of their inability to spell my name, and they should be refunding my money for the checks while not replacing them with new ones.  So, well, that is all I did today, beyond receiving my ATM card.  Well, I don't think that any of you care about all that stuff.  As for the reasoning of the title, I was at a loss as to what to put there.  Well, I have no more to say, so I bid you adieu.

      Well, I say ditto, since, well ditto, I did nothing of any real note today.  Finally got my change deposited into my account, up $42.01, and, well, that's really all I did.    I did get my checks, though they, yet again, failed to correctly spell "Stephen."  apparently for the two people who have filled out the check orders and the requests to fix them, thin that the name is spelled "Stephan." The main question that this prompts is: How can the person I tell that my name was misspelled, make the exact same mistake?  Bah, oh well, all this proves is how competent the people that handle the money of this nation are (and now Enron happened).  For the time being, I will leave you on your own, and I bid you adieu.  Time/Date Note: Same old same old, I bumped it back to what it reflects.

      So, today was boring.  Yo hice nada hoy (repeated for effect).  In English, for those of you who cannot speak Spanish, that means I did nothing today.  So, here's to a better day tomorrow.  Well, since there was nothing today, I really can't write about anything.  If anyone wants to do something, just let me know.  With all said, I bid you adieu.  Because I can here is a piece of music:    You may need to turn the volume to 100 on the slider in the control.  It is also set so that it shouldn't start on it's own.

      Well, thanks to some peoples, I am gonna continue this for a bit more, at least, though I do wonder who Rora is (see comments of the last post).  So, today was more entertaining.  Woke up early (for summer) at 10-ish, cleansed myself, and played some good old Star Trek Armada II.  After all that I Ellen had Russ and I over and we played Risk then a game called Guillotine.  Then we played Soul caliber II, and when Ellen had to eat, Russ and I went to his house where we ate, watched Black Hawk Down (at least parts), and talked 'bout MMORPGs while he played Final Fantasy XI.  And that brings me back to this chair, and after talking to people for a while, to writing this message.  So, now that you know my day, any ideas for the future?  I need to find more things to entertain myself with during the summer.  Well, any ideas to be appreciated, thanks in advance.  Well, with no more to say, I bid you adieu.

      Well, this may very well be the last daily account.  Woke up late, played Rise Of Nations with Russell, ate dinner, went to  Chronicles of Riddick .  There isn't that exciting.  Wanna know why that may be the last?  I have nearly nobody reading these posts.  It's well, kinda like real life:  I'm completely ignored.  Frequently assumptions are made that I am busy, though in actuality many of you have been told I am indeed bored for the vast majority of the time, I have nearly nothing to do.  So, if you really are reading this, then you might wanna make a comment on the previous post.  If you think that my life is just that boring, then you probally don't read this.  So, as you should have read above, these are the very reasons that I'm reconsidering posting to my blog.  Well, I suppose that I should get used to being ignored, as I figure that is my place in life.  Well, for a few of you, I bid you adieu.

      Not for a good reason mind you.  I did nearly nothing.  I sat around played Star Trek Armada II and found the phone company has decided that they want to mess our phone up.  Well, that completes the synopsis of my day.  I suppose I ought to find something better to do for tomorrow, oh well, life continues anyway.  So, with the, at this point, normal depressed tone, I bid you adieu.

      Today started as a day of errands.  First, we had my checks fixed to have my name spelled correctly, then we ate and got chlorine tabs for the pool.  After the errands, I played Star Trek: Armada II, and then showed Ellen the pictures and a run through the NYC trip.  When all that was said and done, I went to Alex's and we watched disc one of volume two of the Family Guy DVDs.  And, well, that takes me to here, where I have checked my e-mail and I'm currently writing this entry.  So, now that the day has been accounted, I can bid you adieu.  Time/Date Note:  The time and date have been rolled back to reflect the day that it is applicable to.  The accurate time is 2:04 AM on June 10, 2004.

      Today was boring.  I did nearly nothing.  I began with a trip to MicroCenter, where I looked at potential laptops, purchased new components for my brother's new-ish PC.  The second thing I did, was rebuild my server into my brother's old computer doubling the speed from a 466 MHz Celeron to a 933 MHz Pentium III.  And after that, I played some Star Trek: Armada II (the tutorials).  And now I am going to sleep.  So as you might imagine this falls into one of the least interesting days.  As for my emotional state: nothing as changed, no apiffanies(sp), not miracles, no revelations, no nothing.  And as a result of that, I am same old same old, depressed, and well, depressed.  So, here is the daily bidding of the adieu: And now I bid you adieu.

      Well, I had so much fun!  It was so cool to see 5 plays (6 if you count the one on Ellis Island), and then be able to see so many cool sites while riding cabs, the subway, and the bus.  I really don't even know how I'm gonna be able to tell you, without showing you the pictures, explaining them, and then playing the music with a digest of what happens for each one.  I figured that I might be able to type the itinary(sp) for you, so here ye go: Thursday, 6/3: 12:19 - Arrival in Newark, NJ in Newark Liberty International Airport 3:15 - Tour of NBC Studios 5:00 - Return to hotel and dinner with own group 8:00 - Performance of  Hairspray  (at the Neil Simon Theatre, 52 nd  Street, between Broadway and 8 th  Avenue)  Friday, 6/4: 9:30 - Visit to SOHO and Greenwich Village 5:30 - Return to hotel and dinner with own group 8:00 - Performance of  Avenue Q  (at the Golden Theatre, 45 th  Street, between Broadway and 8 th  Avenue)  Saturday, 6/5: 9:00 - Tour of Metropolitan museum of Art and purchase of matinee tickets at the TKTS Booth (if you keep reading you'll find that the viewing of that show is in here too) 5:00 - Return to hotel and dinner with own group 8:00 - Performance of  Fiddler on the Roof  (at the Minskoff Theatre, 44 th  Street, between Broadway and 8 th  Avenue)  Sunday, 6/6: 8:30 - Visit to Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Chinatown, and Little Italy 5:00 - Performance of  Blue Man Group  (at Astor Place Theatre, 434 Lafayette Street, &frac12 block south of 8 th  Street) (After this Taxi to Hard Rock Cafe, followed by more free time, in which the Tony's occurred, though I elected not to join Kurzym in attending the red carpet, but rather to see  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Alzkaban (sp))  Monday, 6/7: 10:30 - Meet in lobby and depart (at this time I woke up late, and had to get ready to go, complete with finishing packing, in no time at all, I managed in 10 minutes) 11:00 - Seminar with an actor (who showed up at like 11:30) 4:45 - Depart from La Guardia Airport on Continental flight 333  And, well that was my exciting trip.  If you have any questions, my phone continues to function, and I am probablly on AIM.  If you wonder how I'm doing: I'm doing meh.  I am happy, tired, depressed, puzzled, and well, that's same old same old at this point.  So, here is the part where I bid you adieu.

      Well, today was entertaining.  Slept till noon-thirty and then went to the mall, Barnes and Noble, and back home. And once there I prepared for my trip to NYC tomorrow.  So, after that, I've been chatting online with assorted people, and it comes up that there are two bills (identical might I add) in Congress that would require military service for every citizen.  So, this bothers me to no end, seeing as to I am bothered with the idea of any death being my fault, even in a remote way.  I suppose that this is most disturbing in the sense that thins nation was founded on the idea of popular sovereignty and that the individual is more important than the masses.  In this sense this bill would remove the ability for a person to choose their live, it certainly hinders the freedom of the press with the military only allowing approved things in, they check packages for what they deem acceptable.  A second way in which it hinders my first amendment rights is in the removal of my freedom of assembly, I would be required by law to be in particular places at particular times.  And now you know why I'm gonna move to Canada (or some other country) pending this bill's approval.  Now, does it bother anyone but me that I can look at some really disturbing pictures on Gen[M]ay, and off all that the idea that the government wants to tell me what to do with two years of my life is disturbing?  So, as for my mood during the day, it went from good, to depressed, to down right irritated.  I hope I do better in NYC.  And now I bid you adieu.  Note: You can see the page on the bill at  urlLink http://congress.org/congressorg/bill.xc?billnum=S.89&congress=108  or  urlLink http://congress.org/congressorg/bill.xc?billnum=H.R.163&congress=108  and you can read the text (as above its the same) at  urlLink http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:S.89:

      Well, as it were I hadn't posted for today.  So here it comes:  As you might guess, I'm back.  Conincidently, that's about all for today, so I figure I should go over the happenings of the time I have been gone.  Thursday(first day of trip, last day of school): I went to school, for the last time as an under-classman, and subsequently flew to San Jose, California.  After arriving there, we drove to Camp Mather(the camp at which Strawberry is hosted).  We pulled in at 1 AM (for the record we are now in PST(California time)), so that brings us tomorrow.  Friday: Well, today was the first real day of vacation, we've arrived, my Dad had been there and set up camp, I've slept, and now I'm off to find my friends.  So, I meandered off to find Julia (for those of you who don't know, my friend from oh so long ago), and eventuality found her, and met several of the people she had come to know.  And as such I hung out with these people, wandering around going from the General Store, to the Concession area, to the assortment of camps, to the lake, and back again.  Saturday: Well, for Saturday, it was pretty much the same as Friday.  Only exception being that I knew more people at this point.  Sunday: Sunday was a day.  It was the most relaxing of all the days.  It started with the typical roundup of friends, followed by my discovery of a hidden talent: apparently, I am good at giving massages.  Followed by food, and well, after that about all I did was go to the teen dance, where I spent much of the time talking and giving massages.  But yeah, after a relaxing day, I went to sleep, and prepared to leave for a unknown period of time.  Monday: Well, as for this Monday, it was time to pack up.  We got out by noon, and went to Yosemite National Park for the rest of the day.  We gawked at the various waterfalls and features of the Yosemite Valley, and hiked along a trail for some time.  Beyond that, this Monday was spend traveling and sleeping.  And now were up to today, see Strawberry and a day.  So, I must say good day/night/morning.  I bid you adieu.

      Well, I've just returned from Russ's DDR party.&nbsp; So, I figured that I might as well write an entry.   As for today:&nbsp; I woke up, and went to Danielle's and played bored games, after which we talked and later departed to Russ's house.&nbsp; It was quite amusing when Steven wouldn't allow Danielle to prompt an invite, and since Steven though he wasn't invited.&nbsp; After all that we dropped Steven off and proceeded to Russ's house for&nbsp;the party.&nbsp; It works well, as it were it helps seating when you have the couples in one chair each.&nbsp; Well, anyway Russ was the only one without a chick there, until we called Steven (Russ had originally invited him, he just didn't remember).&nbsp; Steven ran over (literally, he chose to walk/run there), and after that we sat around, played DDR and talked.&nbsp; Well, that ended and I got a back home.&nbsp; I watched the end of Fururama and then proceeded to come up here, I chose a skin for Trillian, and chatted.&nbsp; I'm watching Comedy Central, and typing this (It takes a while when you stop often).&nbsp; And well, that's today.   If you want to hear about the days before that here's the major events since my last entry:   I started my job yesterday ( Friday 7/23/2004).&nbsp; For those of you who haven't heard, I configure a server the the hardware specs that we are instructed to.&nbsp; Then, we load them into racks, making sure the racks are wired.&nbsp; When its all hooked up it gets tested to make sure that the rack can be used and doesn't have any hardware problems.&nbsp; As for the rest of this day, nothing happened.   As for the day before that (Thursday 7/22/2004)&nbsp; I had my first date.&nbsp; I took Danielle to  The Terminal .&nbsp; When the movie was over, I fixed Danielle's wifi connection; after&nbsp;which we went to Steven's and played a bit of&nbsp;DDR and, mostly,&nbsp;bored games (Cranium, Pictionary).&nbsp; We then went our own ways for a bit, and then Danielle, Russ, Ellen, and I hung out at Ellen's.&nbsp; We played more board games (Upwords, Uno).&nbsp; That concludes this day.   As for Wendsday (7/21/2004).&nbsp; We (Alex, Izz, Danielle, Steven, Sarah (Steven's GF), and I) played DDR at Steven's house.&nbsp; About the only thing that a few people would point out is that Danielle spent most of the time (while not playing) on my lap.&nbsp; That certainly made for an interesting IM later ("Hey, Stephen, why don't you hook up with Danielle, she obviously wants to?"&nbsp; Thanks Alex).   Tuesday (7/20/2004) -&nbsp;Thursday (7/15/2004):&nbsp; I can't seem to remember.&nbsp; I do know I've almost certainly played DDR, video games, chatted online, hung out with people, and well, done sweepingly general things.&nbsp; It seems to occur quite often.   As for the few of you who read this often:&nbsp; sorry I haven't updated.&nbsp; I just have other things to do.   So, in the future I'll probably update more, though I'll have less to say, most of my week will be work.&nbsp; Oh well, I bid you all adieu.

      So, I haven't updated in sometime, and I have just found myself some time.  So, here I am, I've spent most of my days doing assorted activities, commonly playing Rise of Nations, and several other strategy games, on my LAN.  I've been out and about for oh so many different activities.  All in all over the last few days I've gamed (both DnD and the computer gaming), swam, chatted online, watched movies (EuroTrip, Anchorman), eaten out with friends (Fudruckers), browsed the [M], and watched TV.  Well, all in all, that is all I've done for the past few days.  I have indeed done several of those on multiple days with various groups.  Today one interesting thing did happen, my father told me that my brother and he had checked everything out and asked his manager (my brother's) if I could work with them of a order for servers.  So, as it were I am interested in it, and my brother will be setting everything up for me to work there.  I'm gonna be starting soon, and though its a temporary job, I should be working till school.  Well, all told I'm happy about that.  One thing I find most amusing is the number of other people that have been looking for jobs, only for me, the one who isn't, to have my family arrange one for me.  Well, I must announce that I have been incorrectly spelling Isabelle, and spelling it Isabel.  So, sorry Izz.  Now that all is said and done I bid you adieu.

      Well, the last 2 days haven't really had much happen in them.  My same old boring life, but here it is.  Yesterday I spent playing computer games, I went to Jennifer's and watched everyone finish the SSBM tournament.  When they all had done that, we went to the park and talked.  When we had groan tired of that we went to Russ's house by way of Danielle's.  There we played Monopoly, where we had the AOL (Daneille) and TimeWarner (Me) merger, to counter Netscape, (Isabel) (though we never acquired her) and the grocery store price-fixers, Lucky's (Russ), Albertson's (Alex), and Ralph's (Ellen (Isabel's friend)).  Well, with all of that we decided that it was practically impossible for us to actually have the game end.  With that, we went to Taco Bell/KFC to eat.  When that was over we went to Isabel's and walked then some of them watched Pirates and I tried to fix a DSL connection, that as it turned out needed to just sit unplugged for a bit, as we trickled out of there.  With me safely at home I spent the night fixing the downloads section of my site, then browsing the [M], downloading FireFox, and chatting on AIM.  As for today, my filler activities were only broken by Russ and Danielle coming over here to play Rise OF Nations, then Age Of Mythology.  After they left I watched the all important season premiere of Stargate SG-1.  Well, that over I returned to my filler activities, and wrote this entry.  I don't think I can account much after that, considering I don't have the ability to see that far into the future, it's just to cloudy.  Well, all said and done, check my website ( urlLink http://sclm.gotdns.com/ ) and I bid you adieu.

      Well, its been a while (4 days), but I don't have much to say.  I think I'm going to put a list of the days and the activities on each of them.  Yes, that's what I'm going to do.

      Well, I figure I ought to post, keep you all up to date on the marvelous world that is me.  Yesterday I did nearly nothing, i spent most of the time at home, doing the same old activities, until the birthday party.  Well, that's what I recall, it all seems to run together.  As for today I went 3 hours, at lunch, went to a bird refuge, drove inside of there, and the way out back to the main road, sat in the car on the way back connected to the intarweb.  I got back to my house at 8:00 exactly, after a stop at Starbucks.  When I got home I proceeded to play NWN, chat online, and continue with my normal activities.  I played a game of StarCraft again, with Russ.  So, that leads me back tot eh filler activities, and the writing of this entry.  With everything said and done, I figure I'll tell you all that I'll be at a DDR party at Nick's house tomorrow at noon.  Well, done that, so I hereby bid you adieu.  Note:  The time and date have been altered.

      Well, today I woke up at 12:30 for a phone call from Ellen.  She asked if I wanted to do something, and seeing as to I though I'd be leaving for a trip shortly, I said that I couldn't do anything.  I chatted on AIM, browsed the [M], and browsed other websites after that.   When I found that I wasn't going to be doing anything with the family around 5 I called Ellen up so she knew that I had nothing to do, in the event she had managed to pool people for some event.  So, after finding she had not, I continued to lounge about the house, chatting, browsing the intarweb, playing NeverWinter Nights (at one point), and watching TV.  At one point in there I even made brownies.  When all that was said and done, I began to write this entry.  Well, that has to be the most boring day ever, well, I suppose that it is possible to do less, though, I don't usually do anything else when I don't hang out with my pals.  So, that is my day, how was all of yours? (respond in AIM or on your own blogs as you see fit)  As for what I plan to do after this, well, that's simple:  sleep.  I do still wonder about the question posed yesterday.  Would anyone care to answer, if you need help with the pictar scaling, then you can IM me and I'd be glad to help, as always.  For the record, I'd appreciate comments, it helps me keep up with who reads this thing.  Before I depart, I shall wish Alex a happy birthday.  Well, nuff said, I bid you adieu.

      Well, first of all, I'd like to point out I didn't post yesterday.  Though uncommonly seen, I do indeed have flaws, I forgot to post.  So, first lets recall yesterday.  Well, today (yesterday) I awoke and as i recall, spent the time browsing the [M] and chatting online until Russ invited me over.  I went over, and on the way I mentioned that my family was going to see  Spiderman 2 , and when Russ heard that he went into such a state if "r u serios?" that we decided to go see it.  We arrived, got tickets, and got in line.  IT turns out that my mother had been held up by traffic, so they saw the 7:00 show.  Well, when all that was over Russ and I, went to his house and we watched  Yellow Submarine , for about as long as Russ could pay attention to it.  When he was thoroughly amused and done with the film, I went home.  I arrived went back on AIM, and the [M], and the remainder of the intarweb.  After which, I went to sleep.  And as for today (the actual one), I awoke, went to the intarweb and AIM for some time.  I played Starcraft for a while, and then I got bored.  I began to reminisce.  I Google Image'd for  Santa Barbara  and looked at the pics (I've included some at the bottom of this post).  So, at this point I've pretty much led myself back here.  I ask all of you out there, what place have you lived in/been to that you miss/like the most?  Feel free to include pics, just be sure to scale them down to 404 pixels wide (you can use the height and width attributes of the IMG tag to do that (to find the height use the proportions you learned in math class)).  With two days fully accounted and my questions asked, I bid you adieu.  Remember: you can post questions/comments/smart alec remarks with the comments, just be sure to leave your name.

      Well, today was not too much different.  I went to work, I came home.  I went out with friends, though all the way to Alex's.  Ate, played music.  After that goodness we were going to go to Danielle's and since I didn't have the time to watch a movie I was dropped off at home.  Since I've told you all about how cool the Arlington theatre is I figured I'd show you some pics if I found some.  So, here is what I found preceded with a synopsis.  This is a picture of the front of the theatre.  It isn't that impressive, especially in this picture.   This is the courtyard.  This shot is taken next to the one box office that you can kind of seen in this picture above.  I think it is a really cool place, nice breeze, shade, fountains.  It was fun, particularly when waiting on school field trips.   I need a picture of the inside.  Too bad I can't find any.  If I do I'll post them pronto.  With all said, stay classy San Diego [Houston]...but mostly I bid you adieu.

      The first thing I need to say is  Family Guy is coming back to Fox!   On August 18 th  and 25 th  they are airing 4 back-to-back episodes.  They will begin airing new episodes in 2005.  Well, now that's out, I need to talk to you about your TPS Reports.  Well, not really, your comments, or rather your lack of them.  It's important to respond, it gives me something to look at, even more than the boss' TPS Reports.  So, comment, and make sure I know who you are.  AS for the normal topic:  my last few days have been the same old same old.  I've gone to work, and after work Monday I slept, after on Tuesday it was Dungeons and Dragons, and well, lots of intarweb, after today I went to Russ's and watched a movie (I forgot the name).  The movie was good, just a bit different than most.  As for sleeping, it is really nice when you haven't slept much.  The DnD game was fun; though, I need to finish the leveling of my character (I think the only part I'm missing is my skills).  Well, that is about all I have done.  At work it's a progression as follows: box--(unbox, place rails in rack)-->server stack, ready rack--(configure servers and load them into rack)-->wire rack---->burn in (test all the internal components and cables) That is all I can say about it to be brief, if you wanna know more you can IM me, though I doubt any of you will.  Having all said and done, I figure it would be appropriate to remind you to leave me a message and to sign off.  Stay classy San Diego[Sugar Land]...Go fuck yourself San Diego[Sugar Land]...Let's just stick with "I bid you adieu."  Note:The lines listed above are from  Anchorman .  If you didn't know that then you haven't seen it.  If you haven't seen it, go see it...right now...go!

      Well, I figured it was about time for me to update.  Not much has really passed.  I've spent much of my time working; though, many people went on a weekend trip for Erika's birthday (I wasn't one of them, not to say I should have been (actually met her for  a few hours the day before)).  Well, anyway, I'm here.  On Friday I saw  The Village .  It sucked.  It was so terrible.  It was hyped to the point that they could have shown a black screen for 30 minutes and made money.  Well, they probably will [make money], even with them showing everyone coming.  It gives you massive clues that something is gonna happen, and when it actually does happen, the camera shot lets you see it long before its a problem.  Now remember, all of that is not to mention that fact that the guys in the theater were completely unable to stay silent.  They all screamed, in what sounded like (to me) a higher group than the women.  So, with everyone screaming when a person is standing in a field of red berries, and the movie being incredibly predictable (obviously things occasionally get done differently, though to the same predicted avail) the movie just sucked.  The only thing that really was quite abusing was the retarded guy.  He made the movie.  I especially found it amusing when he chose to pit the mentally challenged against the visually challenged, though predictable, it was funny to see something actually happen.  Well, I needed to rant about that, so now that that's done I'll tell you what else I've been doing.  I literally spend my whole weekday at work.  I get home and then promptly go do something with friends.  It is fun, though exhausting.  The most pitiful thing about it is that I keep not sleeping, oh well, I will tomorrow night (I think).  So, out of  sleeping, working, and eating, I've been playing SimCity 4 and X2:The Threat (completely unrelated to the movie/comic/whatever;  it's a space simulator), as well as hanging out with people.  So, I've done just about everything of interest in this area.  Well, as for tonight, I got nostalgic and decided to look at some pictures of CA (stop telling me I'm obsessed, just nostalgic).  Well, I found some really cool ones and I've decided to post them, so here they are: This is a picture of Sterns Wharf at sunset.  The wharf has some great food++ and you all would go there.   this is a picture of the Santa Barbara Mission, built like all the 21 missions in California to educate and convert the Native Americans.  It is now a neat looking building that happens to have the city rose garden across Mission Street from it, and around the corner a nice wooded park, in other words, the area around it is really nice.    Well, I'd said my words, I've shown you the pictures, I've ranted about  The Village , and I have one last thing to say.  You all should come visit Southern California, and tell me/take me so I can show you the cool places.  In other words, before/during/after collage, Road Trip/whatever in SoCal.  With my final statement made I will give you my closing statement:  I bid you adieu.
