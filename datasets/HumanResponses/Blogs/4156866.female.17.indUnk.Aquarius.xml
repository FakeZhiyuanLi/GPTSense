Vin Vin.. suppose to meet him to ask for advise on my FormD but he last min fan wo fei ji... sae tat he is not free... also dunno if it is the truth of wat... but nvr mind lah... It is also better for mi to keep a dist 1st before everything is clear loh.. He has also given mi a chance to draw more ideas out.. but the main problem is dunno if i'm still in the correct track... Hiaz.. one word of advise... " nvr pretend that u know everything when u are new in the area... U will die in a ver horrible way..." My FormD is a ver good example... n it is better to ask for advise when u thin ur stuff is in the wrong way... Dun wait until last min... it is ver DANGEROUS!     Haiz.. gtg le.. hav to start doin somethin abt it le.. Cannot keep relying on Vin Vin n other ppl... or i'll nvr learn...

I got struck by the qns... i suddenli realised that wat he sae is quite true.. after 20 to 30yrs... wat m i goin to do? wat is goin to happen to mi?

Yishi got so scared that she freaked off and cried loh... haha... but i also same same loh... hehe... This crap lasted for about an hr or so before everyone started to scream into the mic when i actualli fell aslp on the sofa loh... The chalet finalli resume the peacefulness at about 4+ in the morning....  2 day  Mm... Our 2nd day started at about 12noon... everyone is just to tired to wake up loh... All low battery le... Den we went "kayaking"... It was damn fun loh although i fell and injured my knee cap... when i am in the highest point of my mood loh.. =p  The BBQ was quite a successful one lah... Mm... the food lasted for quite a long time lah... despite of all the scolding i got for somethin i did not do loh... hehe... rmb the senior i tell u about... Mm.. let name him...

While some of them went to the OLD Changi Hospital..( as usual), the rest of us actualli stayed in the chalet just to teach Vin Vin how to play majong... =) he is such a lousy player.. haha... but i also not very good loh... Den when it is about night time, i hav this one to one private chattin session with him loh.. =) got to found out things about him and... he realli make my day loh... =) haha... --> dun tell u wat we talk abt.. =x  3 day  Which is today... we got everyone up early in the mornin wwhen we all slp at abot 5+ loh... den clean up and stuffs like tat..

We hav to keep together for the rest of the 3 yrs de loh.. this hatred thing mus be resolved soon... n it is a MUST... ok... i agreed that i still have this unhappiness within me lah... den if i m the ASS***, i will b damn sad loh.. when i turned up for the chalet.. ppl shoot mi.. when i try to help... ppl say that i ver fake and stuffs like tat... So... i realli hope that i can try to resolve this loh den realli hope that we have acheive our aim- to bring the group of ppl closer to each other loh...

        Today is just another ordinary day for me... slacking at home and watching TV... Early in the morning got woke up by my lao gong... then went over to his house to pei him... There is a 360 degree change in his room... All the furniture were shifted... Mm... but i still prefer his past layout..  Haiz... then guess what I saw when i'm on my way to buy my lunch with my mum in the afternoon? I met my lao gong worz... but this time... he is with 2 other gers.. haha...For those who think tat i will go up to him n do something funny right... then you really don't know mi well... I didn't do anything... I just pretend that I do not know him and walked off... At that moment, nothing is in my mind.. REALLY! i swear... i could not think of any reason except he is just seeing friends... All the scenes that i saw kept swirling in my mind... but deep in my heart i knew that there is no point asking.. So all the questions were buried inside me until he called!  Without myself realising, i let the cat out of the bag... I hinted him in an indirect manner... however, being the clever him.. he understood immediately and explained on the spot... Alot of you may think that "haha... Eileen will not believe you when you say that the 2 gers are your god daughters...." haha.... in contrast, i chose to believe him... Or should I say I chose to deceive myself...  No matter what... Trust is the most important thing between all relationship what... so.. what can i do... haha... =) lao gong is  I  chose de worz... at least he bother to lie to me lah... ( if he is really lying...)

On the firework... haha  First time in my life, i actually went down to Marina to view the firework display. The whole display was stunning... It was like just diplaying for your personal view... One after another the colourful firework bloomed in front of me and my pals... (918 guys)  Haiz... All the wonderful things ended as soon as the firework finished. Firstli was the divide of cab... wa kao.. treat me like ball ar... throw here throw there... den it was the F**K grp... walked together to Bugis le hai snatched my cab... they ming ming know i rushing home loh... den the worst part is they going towards my house but den ask the other guy from my group to join them instead of me... They GOOD! I realli angry with them loh... What kind of frienz is that man...   Aiyo... Never mind le lah.. let the bygone b bygone... Luckly mummy slp le... or else sure bei ma de... After all, i did enjoyed myself today... Just that i abit confused if i should carry on in a group that don't really seemed to welcome me le (or is i think too much)... ~dunno~  *~MISSING HIM~*
