      So I was recently introduced to The Goonies because apparently I was a deprived child and never saw it as a kid. What a great 80s movie! I think I would have been scared of Sloth as a kid though.  In honor of The Goonies, today we will be discussing our fave 80s movies. I have to mention Sixteen Candles and the Breakfast Club, my personal faves. I was a big Molly Ringwald fan!  Ok guys, share!

      So last night I watched the 1992 JCC rendition of Peter Pan starring RENEE CHAFITZ!! I think I was the best Wendy I have ever seen. The video made me start thinking about my past career ideas. For years I was going to be an actress! Today, let's discuss what we all thought we were going to grow up to be when we were little.

      There is not just one issue on my mind today so here are a few thoughts I have had this morning.  Feel free to comment on any or all of them...  1. Rain: It has rained way too much this summer.  If I wanted to live in a cloudy, dreary city I would move to London. I live in Texas, so I expect sunshine at all times!  2. Power trips: It seems that young attorneys sometimes go on power trips and feel that they are much better than law clerks. However, just one short year ago they were mere law clerks themselves and really do not know a lot more than clerks do.  3. Virgins: After watching Driven on Jessica Simpson last night I began to think about how cool it is to get married a virgin.  I would guess this happens to a very small number of people these days.  I'm pretty impressed with their will power.  Though I worry if this was your goal you might be in a bigger hurry to get married than necessary!

      So after seeing Napolean Dynamite last night I got the idea for a new post.  Today we are going to talk about our memories from when we were dorks! (Don't say you were never a dork, because YES you were!) The movie brought back memories for me of trapper keepers, caboodles, side pony tails and recess.  I also remember a very sad day when i cried in the bathroom at recess because I was new and didn't have anyone to play with.....wow, I was sort of pathetic! Ok, everyone share!

      So I only have 4 more days of work! As crazy as it sounds, i'm ready to get back to school. I don't know about this working all day every day thing! It has been a very eventful summer--two clerkships, new apartment, big break up, I was reunited with my 6th grade boyfriend, big job offer etc. Why doesn't everyone contribute a story about something unexpected that happened this summer. yay blogging!!
