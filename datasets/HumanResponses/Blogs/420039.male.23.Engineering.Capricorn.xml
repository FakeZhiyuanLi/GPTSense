       If you are among the 1.2 million students expected to graduate in 2004, your starting salary should be higher than your 2003 counterparts'. The good news is 24 percent of hiring managers will increase salaries for new grads.  The study found that more than two-thirds of disciplines studied saw a rise in the average offer. Computer science majors saw the greatest increase of 8.9 percent to $48,656. Information science grads and management information system had conservative increases. Engineering offers nudged up slightly, although the civil engineering sector saw its first decrease since 1995. Business graduates saw a modest improvement, as did liberal arts general studies disciplines, with the exception of psychology majors, which are down 8 percent.  .:  urlLink  full article

        You‚Äôve met someone terrific and you want to spend all your time together. And so you do ‚Äî to the detriment of other relationships and the displeasure of your best pals. Yet many couples successfully manage to maintain their romantic and platonic relationships with relative ease. They‚Äôre living proof that you can avoid forsaking friends even when you‚Äôre swept up in the whirlwind of a new romance.   ‚Ä¶    ‚Äúbecause they're competing for your attention and affection, not realizing that when it comes to most people, there's enough love for everyone ‚Äî though not always enough time.‚Äù   ‚Ä¶    When romance has a hold on you, holding on to your friends can be a challenge. It‚Äôs worth the effort because keeping your friendships and your romance gives you a fuller, more engaged life.       .:   full article

         It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are a lot of things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now.    You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met and that people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you do not realize is that they are realizing that too and are not really cold or catty or mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.    You look at your job. It is not even close to what you thought you would be doing or maybe you are looking for one and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and are scared.    You miss the comforts of college, of groups, of socializing with the same people on a constant basis. But then you realize that maybe they weren't so great after all.    You are beginning to understand yourself and what you want and do not want. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging a bit more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and add things to your list of what is acceptable and what is not.    You are insecure and then secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused.    Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.    You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you or you lay in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough to get to know better. You love someone but maybe love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you are not a bad person.    One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap and getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic. You go through the same emotions and questions over and over and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision.    You worry about loans and money and the furture and making a life for yourself and while winning the race would be great, but right now you'd just like to be a contender! What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.

         NeiL is back online. I haven't posted anything to my BLog in a long time. The last time anything was posted was on 12/16/2001. So on 1/19/2003 I decided to start posting BLogs again. When I posted everything went well, but my new page was not updated. I tried again next month, it still didn't work. I tried a few days ago, it didn't work. I sent an email for help. Thanks blooger.com work fixing my problem. Maybe this time I will post something or anything more frequently.

         Had my appointment a week ago. Still on the IR. Took off the cast and 5 stitches. Still have the metal wire. Another 15 days on the DL, most likely. Hereís a sample of the op-report: ì...A stainless steel wire suture was the placed through the volar plate with a pullout suture being placed also in the wire. Two drill holes were made with #0.035 K-wires and the wires were then taken through the phalanx through the dorsum...î  urlLink     urlLink    The picture on the left was the cast I was wearing for two weeks. The picture on the right is my new cast. Itís not as bulky, heavy, or uncomfortable as the first cast. Itís not even a cast. I donít know what itís even called. At least now I can use my left arm/hand more.

         Going to COMIC-CON tomorrow in    San Diego  .   First time going.   Some people laughed when I said I was going while some people were jealous that they werenít going.   Weíll see which group will be right. As of this morning, I still havenít decided if I am going to SD tonight or tomorrow morning.   So many choicesÖ   There is so much I havenít posted here yet.   I wanted to post Vanessaís Luau b-day party pictures, an update on my injury (the op-report), and update on my house.   I wanted to post last night but talked with my ìtrendy-stylishî friend in   New York   instead.   Hey Jen next time you walk somewhere in NY, bring a towel.        The visit to    Salinas    was fun. Got to see the fams! Havenít been to    Salinas    in a long time. There is a really nice Safeway by my house. That is the nicest Safeway I have ever seen. It even has a gas station. If you use your Safeway card you get 3 cents off per gallon. Went to the local mall there, still the same, nothing new. While in Macyís I saw my ìSpecial Kî. What do I say to my ìSpecial Kî? Miss having it in the morning, everyday. Grown weak without it. "Special K" is good for your body. Builds strong bones. [HA HA] She did look good though. I also saw my friend Alice and her baby boy. First time I have seen him, cute kid. And another one is on the way. Not wasting time I see. I also found out that my friends Neil and David are going to be in    San Diego    next week! Looks like more trips to SD for me. With the exception of last week, I have been in SD at least once during the week since mid-May. I think I will go to SD tonight.

        Day 10 on the disabled list. That means 5 days to go. I can wait to get this cast off. I need my left arm/hand back. But one hand can still do damage. Going to visit Salas Califas (Ocho Tres Uno) for the weekend. Havenít been back home in a long time. Wait is Salinas still my home? Or is Corona now? Do I even have a home? Am I Nomad? Isnít home where the heart is? Oh wellÖ

        Day 7 on the 15-day DL. There are 8 more days until I am eligible to come off IR. This is a good rest for me, physically, mentally, and emotionally. This is my second day at work. Slowly working, but getting things done. Programming with one hand is hard. This is my 3rd post today. That shows how much work I have done today. My AIM buddy is at work today. It's not fun when you're not online... Where is VV?

            I had my 2nd post-op appointment yesterday.    The nurse took the   urlLink  sling/cast  thing off my hand.    My left arm is smaller compared to my right arm.    It looks funny.    Saw the steel wire sticking out of my finger again.    I didnít feel as queasy as I did the first time I saw it.    The Dr. pulled out the wire!    Dang! It hurt like a little bitch.    I could feel the wire moving through the finger slowly and painfully.    The wound where he made the incisions isnít fully healed, so that didnít help as he began tugging the wire.    But the good thing itís out.    Now starts the physical therapy.    It shouldnít be too bad.

            What a day yesterday.    I got the keys to MY HOUSE!    I guess the question to  ìDo I even have a home?î    has been answered.    I got my keys Sunday morning but I couldnít go in yet.    I had to pick up my grandma so she can do her typical Filipino superstitious rituals when moving into a new home.    Since this is MY first home that I own, my mom insisted I do all that to ensure good fortune.    The first thing I had to move in was 50 pounds of rice.    Next she put a gallon on water and a container of salt in the kitchen.    Never heard of doing that, but I have heard of having rice as the first thing in a home.    The next thing was to put an article of clothing in each of the bedroom closets.    Never heard of that either.    Blessed the windows and all the doors with holy water was her next task.    I donít know when she put coins near the front door and at various places.    Nana must have snuck that by me.     Last, the first meal we ate the house was noodles.    Is that suppose to mean longevity? I have no idea.    The next exciting but expensive step is getting stuff for my house! =P         Photos @ Webshots Community
