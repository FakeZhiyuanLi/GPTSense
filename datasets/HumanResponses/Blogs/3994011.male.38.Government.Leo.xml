      One finds, while drunk, that proper grammer, though useful, is often an impediment.  If you have not read any Bukowski, do yourself the favor.  I will suggest Ham on Rye.    My new favorite bar is experiencing an upheaval.  Owners are pulling in opposite directions and the cool owner is at wit's end.  The cool owner, we'll call him Chuck built this place and made it what it is.  The asshole owner, we'll call him Asshole, is now trying to step in and change things.  Aside from the soap-opera like qualities of the situation, there is my personal tragedy of losing the perfect neighborhood bar.  Clearly, this is the greater tragedy and my legions of faithful sheep, uh, readers will send me money and/or women.  Else my wrath will be upon thee.    Grrrr.    Aside:  If any employees of said bar were to read this, you know that I am taking dramatic license in claiming that it is my tragedy.  I know that it is YOUR tragedy.    I am sad and frustrated.  I have made new friends amongst the staff and I don't want to see them leave.    OK, Hemingway and Bukowski are probably exceptions, don't try to write while overly drunk.

      Woke up Friday with a bourbon-induced hangover and a looming sense of dread: "I have to drive to Dallas today to go to that ridiculous class reunion."    I had already paid the seventy-five bucks for the  urlLink pop-tarts and coolaid  or whatever it is they serve you at these things and I had told my mom that I would be in Dallas. I never visit home - not for Christmas, not for Thanksgiving. Never. Yet inexplicably, I am my mom's favorite child and she is a master of the guilt-trip.    So I'm laying in bed 'till noon weighing the pros and cons of killing myself vs. going to Dallas when I realize, I don't have to go. I'm an adult! I can eat an entire bag of  urlLink Oreo cookies  without asking for permission! I can walk around the house naked but for strategically placed peanut butter! I make my own decisions, fraught with error though they may be.    The clouds parted, the sun tousled my hair and bunny rabbits and fawns leaped through the gently blowing grass.    I wonder if I can get my $75 back.

      Read this:  urlLink Secret Cabin to be Destroyed     Just when I start to believe that I'm the one who's insane, something like this comes along to remind me that it's those Other People who are freaking nuts and wouldn't know beauty if it farted flowers in their face.    OK, maybe I am insane.    Regardless, we all make a big deal about which pompous asshole will "lead our country" when it's the local assholes who generally impact our lives more directly.  Did I write "asshole?"  I meant to write "politician."

      Twenty-year class reunion.  Until I got the notice in the mail, I thought it had all happened about five years ago.  Maybe six.    Interestingly, this six year period had somehow contained the ten-year reunion.  I had no desire to go to that one, but after twenty years, I might actually enjoy seeing a few of these people again.  Naturally, the rest of them will be carted off to my bio-fungineering lab where I'm figuring out just how much fun is too much for the human psyche to endure.  I always enjoy the trips to the bio-fungineering lab.  The laughter is so infectious - literally - and they always give me a lolly-pop when I leave.    I should probably visit my mom while I'm in Dallas.    I have to make sure someone comes to feed Chairman Soggy von Uni-ball.    Vodka beckons and I must obey.

      There is no topic more fascinating then the interplay between men and women.  A wants B, but B wants C and C is torn between D and A.  We all just want to have fun and fuck someone hot, but somehow politics  or morals or some other bullshit has managed to rear its ugly head and make it complicated.  Why is that?  Maybe I'm a slut;  I want them all.  I want to stay in bed all day eating strawberries and exploring a beautiful body, but the only woman showing any interest wants to rent kayaks and paddle around a lake.  It's a match made in hell.  I'm an idiot.

      Chapter 3047  After a recent date, a friend asked how it went. I confided to her that although the woman I had seen was very smart, attractive, etc., I was tired of injured birds (little flighty ones like finches) with broken wings who are scared of leaping into the sky. Lately and with good reasons, my friend has been acting as though she thinks she's a finch with a broken wing. In actuality, she's a beautiful eagle who could eat finches for lunch, but she has locked herself inside a cage.  I want her out of the cage and flying.  With me.   Life is too short.  The beauty of this is that she cannot laugh  at  me because as soon as she starts laughing, it will be  with  me.

      This week's survey:  In a completely unbiased survey this weekend, I asked my mom who the greatest person on Earth might be.  Imagine my suprise and humble acceptance when she told me that I was not only the greatest person on Earth, but also the smartest and most handsome.  She then had the audacity to ask the greatest person on Earth when she was going to get additional grandchildren.  "Begone mortal!"  I answered and hung up the phone.  Be sure to check next week's results when I ask my cat, "If my name is Meow, who is your God?" -----------  A beautiful woman I was conversing with recently had the "I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan..." song running through her head and asked, "What was that advertising: cigarettes, bacon-flavored lube, what?"   My answer:  In early 1972, The grocery store chain, Piggly Wiggly produced a bacon-flavored lube named Slippery-Pig.  The earlier "Pork-A-Lot" name was abandoned when farmers came in looking for a place to store their pigs.  Anyway, it turns out that the stuff was not very slippery, it smelled more like perfume and their slogan - "It's chock full of bacony goodness!" - wasn't testing well with their target demographic, so they renamed it "Enjolie" and sold it as perfume.  Strangely enough, she seems to have found this story entertaining.  Maybe I had found the right woman after all these years of bad choices.  I smiled on the drive home, imagining our future life together.  I was filled with a warm glow and felt peace... even though I had just dropped $800 on that whore.  Ha!  Maybe I should go back to drunk scribblings.
