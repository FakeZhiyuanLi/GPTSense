      Some friends and I have a neverending game called "Bad Things To Say After Sex".  It's pretty self-explanatory.  Here I will be posting some of these for everyone to read

      Hi, and welcome to my new blog.  Here is the inevitable introduction.  My name is Matt, I'm 24 and live in Louisville, KY.  I answer to Dolamite, Celebrity, and just about anything else you choose to call me (except for whatever YOU were thinking).  I have a pet sister, a vast collection of shoes I don't wear, and now I have a blog.    That's all you get for now, goodbye.

      Well, shopping went excellent.  I stuck to my schedule, got pretty much everything I was supposed to, and even had time to head to OfficeMax and get an irresistible deal from there. That deal turned out to be even better, but I won't divulge that now.   The funny thing that happened was that the computers went down while I was waiting in line at CompUSA(the computer superstore).  That was irony.  Went to the aquarium this weekend with my brother and Jim.  It was pretty cool.  I must do a new fishtank now, hehe.  Jim had a new reef tank and I am jealous I suppose.  The neat thing about a reef tank is that pretty much everything in the tank is alive.  From the coral to the tiny creatures that inhabit it.  I did have an impulse buy this weekend.  It was a mixer from Guitar Center.  I have really wanted one for a while, but it's not exactly in the time frame I was planning on buying it.  Oh well, it happens.

      Well, Thanksgiving has come and gone and it's almost time to hit the stores.  I'm excited cuz it's like the first time that I have been able to go out when the stores open and I'll actually get to see all that crazy stuff that goes on.  I hope it makes me laugh.  I hope I don't get into it too much.  I hope, I hope, I hope.  I just hope I come home with some money left over and not alot off the "why did I buy that again?" items.  Oh, and I hope to find gifts for my family and not just me, although my parents depend on me to buy my own presents now.  It's much better that way.  You just go buy all the stuff you want and whatever you don't wanna wait till Christmas to open you just go ahead and open it.  Then the parents are SOL cuz they can't give me something I already opened (it's a rule or something).  Not to mention the low number of throw away gifts and "don't use that in the house" gifts you get.  There's still the can of silly string.  I can always count on getting a can of silly string for my birthday or Christmas.  No matter how many times I unload the thing on my little sister throughout the house.  Mom still always yells "go outside with that", but that never stops me and it never stops her from buying the crap either.  Perhaps I should light it on fire.  She would certainly get the message when she saw how quickly it burst into flames.  Hmmm, now there's a thought.  Anyway, it's time for a shower.  Later.

      I'm back again.  An odd thing happened today:  I got a check from Home Depot whom I haven't worked for in at least 6 months.  I think it was my very very delayed last check, but I can only hope that many many more will follow, haha, yeah right.  I'm the king of wishful thinking...and what a great song also!!  Anyways, I got a Pocket PC this week.  It rocks!!  It's the Toshiba e740.  It has WiFi and voice recording which will both be very handy.  The best part is that I can keep track of my checking accout on it too.  I am very bad about not keeping track of that.  That's about the only exciting event as of late.  No new guitar yet.  I'm kinda glad I don't have one around now because when I get home from work I am incredibly dirty and would just get the thing dirty too.  Mmmkay, well that's all.  Bye.

      I'm back.  I broke my computer a while ago and, well, decided to screw my faithful blog readers and not blog.  Since that fateful day I have decided that you people while not worthy of reading my thoughts will only seek other people's thought's instead of mine.  Damn, that was a conceited sentence.  Anyway, I now have a job and a love interest in my life.  Both are doing well, but one is much better, hehe.   I get to see her (Jessica) tomorrow, : ).  	I have no guitar this week, well, no guitar with strings on it.  This is my own fault, but I miss it.  Hopefully, I will have a new one soon.  I need some kind of creative output or my head will explode.  I'm looking into this one :  nice, huh?  Well, that's all.  See ya.

      Haha, ya know what I just noticed.  Well, the advertising on this site changes depending on what I write about in my blog (obviously), but it now says, "Elimate All Odors ..." and "Destoy Odors Naturally  ..." and it's all because I ended my last post with "it's time to clean my dirty self up".  Went up to see the Krinj guys play this weekend.  They keep getting better and better.  Ben is working at a new venue called Radio Down.  It opens tomorrow (New Years Eve) and that's where I will be.  No date and lots of alcohol is a good New Years to me....and a wonderful New Year to you(however you prefer to celebrate)!!!

      Well, Christmas was awesome.  Got everything I wanted and more.  A digital camera, a new printer, a label maker.  My brother and sister now have labels so we know who they are.  My computer is now named Xanaduex.com.  Not that it hosts a website or anything, but Jim's cat is a dot com, so I thought it would be appropriate.  I will be posting more pictures on here, as soon as I find the motivation to remember how to get into into my website and upload.  I'm going up to Cincy later today.  That'll be some fun too.  Well, it's time to clean my dirty self up, later.

      Hmmm, I think I'm staying up all night 2nite.  That's not such a good idea since I have to work at noon tomorrow then go up to Cincy.  Oh well, it's not the craziest stunt I've ever pulled.  Anyways, it's cold and snowy outside.  I spent my workday unloading 2 railcars, 2 wet slippery railcars.  It was super fun.  My work gloves were soaked.  The gloves I wear inside those were soaked.  Tomorrow my gloves will probably be stiff as hell.  Oh my, I'm bitching.  I'll stop.  Well, I guess the plan is to stay up, go shopping, go to work then drive up to the Nati, party, shop some more on Sat., then come home or stay and party depending on the party forcast for Sat. night.       I must say that I'm pleased with my PDA.  Oh, I never posted a pic.  Well, here it is:      I only wish I used it more.  It's come in so handy for keeping track of my checking account.  I just punch in what I spend or deposit and it does all the math for me, yay.  The WI-FI is kinda disappointing.  The best reception I've gotten is 50%, even when I'm right beside our wireless router.  It's no good for web browsing or IMing anyway, since it has a small screen and no keyboard.  I am looking forward to getting a large memory card(Dec 25th) so I can use it as an MP3 player too.       I will probably get my guitar back this weekend too.  I also have a working copy of Cubase so I can lay down some rock n roll track for everyone.  I wrote my greatest Fruity Loops song yet.  It's called "Orchesta" for now.  Yes, I spelled it wrong, but I kept it cuz it sounded cool when I tried saying it.  Try it.  You have to say it kinda with an accent or something, but it's cool.  Trust me.  I keep smelling vodka, but it's just oranges decomposing in my trash can.  It's odd how stuff smells like other stuff.  I suppose that means I should change my trash can.  Probably not gonna happen though.  Well, I'm done.  Time to not sleep, but do something else.  Later.

      Wow, Mondays suck.  It's the day that you know you've got another 5 days of work ahead of you.  The good part is that once Monday is over you have 6 more days before the next one.  Oh, and 3 more till I get paid.  Should be a nice one.  I still have lots of Christmas shopping to do and I still have no idea what to get some people.  Does anybody else find it strange that I stay up till 3 or 4 AM every night?  Not that you could tell me or anything.  That's the point.  This is the one place where everything revolves around me.  Although I would like some feedback sometimes.  Most of it would be crap anyways.  Not saying that everyone who reads this is dumb.  It's just that every open forum seems to have those people who take over and have lots of useless things to say.  Well, time for bed.  Night everyone.

      Well, there's snow on the ground.  There seems to be no food in this house and I'm hungry.  I think it's time for a late night trip to the Waffle House.  Anyways, days go by and still I think of you.  It has turned out to be a pretty fair weekend, at least as far as my life goes.  I always find snow relaxing.  The world just seems to slow down when the snow falls.  They still haven't cleared my street, but I'm hoping the other roads have been.  They almost have to be.  It's not like it's a blizzard or anything.  Well, time to find out.

            I guess during times of hardship or what-not it is usual to look to the future to sort out all the confusing and imperfect events in your life.  I kinda feel like I have been mindlessly whining the last couple of days now.  Everything so far this weekend has been satisfactory.  I have failed to let go of something and it still bothers me, but otherwise I'm looking forward to what lies ahead.  Someday I will learn to balance friends and work and such effectively, but for now I am just switching between the two.  Which seems to have gotten me nowhere with either.  It never seems to be in balance.  Perhaps that is my biggest problem.  If it is then it will be my biggest accomplishment.  Christmastime is always a stressful one.  Judging by the way people drive during it, I am not the only one who feels this way.  Anyway, must go to work...in 4 hours!!

      I'm very tired now, but I've found the will to stay awake and blog for hours and, nah, about 10 minutes.  Hmmm, I find myself speachless now, haha.  Well, lets see, I'm not sure what I'll do this weekend.  Anyways, i have found myself drifting into the useless web of websites to surf.  I must go to sleep.  Goodnight.

      More snow.  Next week I'll be in Eastern Kentucky for some stuff.  It'll suck, but I don't have to work so it might be better than a normal week.  Not getting a paycheck next week will suck though.  I think the final score is that this will be a sucky trip.  The Super Bowl is this weekend and I'm not sure who's playing.  Good luck to the winner, I guess.  Sounds like a good reason to do some drinkin though.  Still working 8 hours for now.  Speaking of work, I gotta go.

      I want  urlLink eternal life rings .  They are so cool.   Eternal life sounds nice right about now too.  It would be hard to plan for retirement though.  Think about it.  When you're sixty it would be like, "Well, I'm gonna live forever still.  Better keep workin".  At 90 the same thing.  It's a cruel joke.

      Well, apparently we're going to have another attempt at working 8 hour shifts again.   I'm giving it a week.  Hope everyone out there is having a good week.  I think I am.  Sometimes I find that I am the person with the most works in progress, but none finished.  Few things ever actually reach a definative end so I guess everyone has alot of unfinished stuff in their lives.  I dunno, just not having and eventful Monday night/Tuesday morning.

      A tumultuous(my new favorite word!!!) snowstorm today.  Snow isn't that bad until you have to drive a lond distance in it.  I have picture of the snow on my cell phone, but I need to get and FTP program to upload it.  Hell, I just thought of another way.  Just a sec.

      It's been a fluish kinda week.  Sorry, I haven't posted for a bit but I was in bed most likely.  I'm definately feeling much better today.  I finally got a new cell phone this week.  My new number is (502) ***-****,  but seriously, if I know you IM, call my house, or Email me to get it.  I'm not going up to the Nati 2nite cuz I'm probably still comtagious.  Maybe tomorrow.  We didn't actually start 8 hour shifts at work.  Somebody lied, or changed their mind the next day after they saw our workload for that day.  I'm somewhat disappionted, but it will make for a better bonus.  I wrote a song that's kinda based on Paranoid Android(Radiohead),  but it's up a step, faster and doesn't really sound anything like it.  It definately sounds like a Radiohead song though.  Like one of those songs they might have written (which is awesome).  I LOVE playing it too.  Over and over.  I think there may be a side project brewing again with me and some people (no names yet).  I will have to break it out with them.  Hehe, well, time to play it some more.  Bye!

      Well, for those keeping track, so far in 2004 I have....  Spent 1 night puking, Kissed too many people to count ( 0 of them implying more than just friendship), Reinstalled Windows 1 time, Read 1 book (The Shining, by Steven King), Had to kill 0 people ( and I hate it when I have to do that!!), Found 1 person insanely attractive, Been late for work 1 time, Seen 6 different bands, Written 4 songs (guitar only)  Oh, BTW, I'm BORED.  I'll probably update this again whenever I'm BORED again.  Well, now you have some idea how my year is going so far.  We go back to working 8 hour shifts tomorrow.  That means we come in an hour earlier and leave 2 hours earlier at a lovely 10:30.  This sounds wonderful.  I just hope I can find something to do with the extra time off.  I'll definately miss the overtime, esp. on payday, but I think I can live without it.  Speaking of work, this week has been SLOOOOOOOOOW.  Both in the amount of work and time passing.  I'm getting my bonus check tomorrow and I'm pumped.  I will have a new guitar soon, maybe, or I'll just satisfy myself with a new mic and some new guitar strings, maybe both (orgasm)!!  This is why I don't need/have a girlfriend, haha.  Actually, that's kinda sad.  Strike that last comment.  Well, gosh, I"m counting the hours till I have to work and, well, goodnight!!

      An interesting weekend to say the least.  Fizzgig was awesome.  I definately had a little situation with a parking lot.  There were like 4 cars parked in this bank parking lot  I went to a club only to come out to the lot full with lots of cars parked where they're not supposed to.  Thus, blocking me in pretty well.  Well, I'm not very patient especially in stupid situations and I was supposed to meet Ben and Andrew in a bit.  Well, worse came to worse and I had to force my way out between a pickup and a Cavalier breaking my side mirror in the process.  Then we went to the after party of the show and I got trashed (probably from my anger towards the idiots who blocked me in).  Definately spent the night over a sink.  I suppose that'll learn me.  Well, I'm very exhausted.  Would love to type more, but my bed is calling me right now, goodnight.

      Well, I have comments now thanks to Haloscan.  Big word up to them.  Be nice or I will take them away.  I think I'm gonna head up to the 'Nati after I get a shower 2nite.  The big Fizzgig/Moth show is tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to that.  I haven't gotten to see them yet since Matt started playing guitar for them.  I have to say I'm pretty satisfied right now for some reason.  I'd have to blame the nice bonus I'm getting on my next check on that.  For some reason when finances are going well I'm much more relaxed.  I now make over $11/hr at work.  Which is also relaxing.  I should start thinking about getting my own place in the next 6 months.  Problem is where.  I wanna be back in northern Kentucky with all my friends, but I have a good pretty secure job right now and would like to keep it too.  If only I could take it with me.  Seems like I keep seeing the same people everytime I go up that way and I'm not seeing a few that I'd really, really like to see.  I think most will be at the Fizzgig show so we'll hopefully get to hang out.  Well, time to clean up.  See ya.

      Sorry for my brief absence this new year, but I bought a new video card that didn't like my computer and stuff.  So I exchanged it and now I'm good to go.  Well, I finally put my new hard drive in so I'm installing all my software (yay, fun!!).  Don't get too jealous.  I had a wonderful New Year's, 'cept for my cigarettes getting all wet in the rain and the hottub.  The big surprise was that my lighter still worked the next day after it dried out from hangin out at the bottom of the hottub for a while.  I had a great time at Radio Down.  The place was super packed (I'm pretty sure I kissed every friend I had there, but if I missed you, muwah!!).  We're back to our regular shedule at work again and I can't say I enjoy it.  There's raises and a bonus coming on the next check though, so I have something to look forward to.  I'm beginning to miss working around people.  Yeah, there's people at work, but only like 4 others on my shift.  Mostly, I miss being around women.  Not like that, but I mean, you miss out on something when you're around all guys for 9 hours a day.  Haha, anyways, I think that means I need a girlfriend and I haven't recieved as many applications as I would like recently.  Well, goodnight.  If you would like to apply....apply in person!

      Someone's not posting much.  Well, I'm still alive.  You are too.  There's not too much to write about.  We're still on 8 hours at work.  I've been going up to Radio Down quite a bit on weekends.  It's still an awesome club.  Ben is now one of the bartenders sometimes.  It's weird having one of your friends behind the bar.  I now have the GR33 guitar synth and it friggin rocks!!!  There's way too much you can do with it and I've hardly started figuring it out, but I CAN play piano with my guitar now.  That's all for now.  Time for work.

I bet someone over there is posting in their blog right now and that makes me horny.  Horny?  Yes, it's true.  Anyway, I guess Europe doesn't really matter right now.  I need to get new boots for work today.  That's why I'm gonna cut this one short.  I would love to type more but...it's dragging, dragging me....away.

      I'm full of shit but I don't do shit.  Does that make sense?   Suddenly everything I do is wrong.  Everything I say is wrong.  I can't even play guitar right.  It feels as if I've forgotten everything I've learned so far in life and I'm starting from scratch.  This happens way too frequently too.  I've become insecure and that makes me bitter which means I don't care about anything.  Pretty soon I will have one of those traumatic experiences that puts everything in focus, but for now I'm on hold.  "We care about your call and will be with you soon."

      If everything goes to hell and you can still laugh about it then you win.   That's my quote for the day.  Write it down.  Use it.  Abuse it.  Say it don't spray it and shyte.  I've reached that point at which work and fun are delicately balanced and I feel one will take over soon.  It seems that I've got a nice little routine going.  However, there's a bunch of stuff on my calendar on days that I'm supposed to work and I can't do all of them.  It's the same problem I've always had.  Shucks.  Sometimes your heart breaks when you least expect it.  Sometimes the only moment that really matters is 5 days away and you would do anything to get there sooner although you know you are gonna wanna run like hell, but it's been set in motion and it has to happen now.  Best part is you have no idea what's going to happen.

      A great weekend!  Partied my ass off.  Twice.  Got to see most everyone.  Got to see Dillinger too!  Awesome show.  Left a little frightened, but that was expected.  I'm also working as a stagehand for the Early November show next Sunday.  That should be a pretty big show.  Work is pissing me off.  Actually, people at work are pissing me off.  I'm not sure why.  Well, time for work.  Wish me luck.

      HI, just wanted to post that absolutly nuthing has been going on recently.  Not true, but nuthing much worthy of posting about.  I partied alot this weekend and got out and played some frisbee golf.  Did pretty well at the frisbee golf.  I ate at Chipotle for the first time and it's exactly the same as Qdoba down in these parts.

      Well, did everything on time today.  Now it is time to party.  I believe at B-mig's place.  I have a long drive ahead and need to clean up so I'll see ya'll on Sunday probably.  If you'd like to party too give me a buzz.  Oh, I just realized no one reads this anyways, haha.  I still post for my own sanity.  It's nice to know noone will ever find out what's here.  Lol, see ya!

       The show must go on   It will.  We are simply having some technical difficulties...or some writer's block/laziness issues.  Haha, I was reading through my past entries and I can definately see that the ADD is kickin.  My mid-paragraph topic changes that drove all my English teachers nuts are in full effect.  It's nice to know some things never change.  I must go in to work at 2:00 tomorrow for a safety meeting.  If you know my cell phone number you should call me around 1:30 and remind me because I will forget.  I hate going in early on a Friday.  I suppose it means we might get off early.  Which would be wonderful since Ben is coming down tomorrow and we must have drinks.  Yes I almost forgot.  I need to call him tomorrow.  Someone should call and remind me about that too.

      Here are some fortunes I got out of cookies.  Only I will add "in the bedroom" to the end of each one.  Thanks B-Mig for the idea.  1. A light heart carries you through all the hard times... in the bedroom.    -What are these hard times?  Well, at least my light heart will get me through them.  2. Success is on it's way to you... In the bedroom.    -and I'm very glad :)  ...And the best by far:  3. You love challenge... In the bedroom.    -You speak the truth brother.  I certainly do!  That's all I can find for now.  Although, it reminds me to eat more Chinese food.  It also reminds me of all the Chinese buffets Kate and I used to go to, awww.  Bah, time to stop reminiscing about psychos.  Time for work.

      Yay, 4 more weeks until I can financially quit my job!!!  I can't wait.  It will be nice to have the option again.  It also means I don't owe anyone anything.  I had a pretty lovely weekend.  The weather was pretty damn lovely too.  My checkbook is a dollar off.  I can't figure out why it would be off exactly one dollar, but it is.  It would have to be some charge that someone added on.  I hate those.  I saw Kill Bill vol. 1 this weekend and I can't wait to see the second one.  Perhaps this coming weekend.  It's also Matt Z's birthday on Thursday.  So Happy Early Birthday!!!  OK, it's late, goodnight.

      I've completely lost my appetite this week.  Maybe I'm working too friggin much to eat.  Really, I don't want a 55 hour work week.  For reals.  Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.  I know what they're trying to do.  They're trying rip me apart from my blog and whoever the hell reads this thing!  Well, they just messed with the wrong guy and his blog.  From now on I'm Blog City.  Maybe not, but we will see.  Right now I must go cuz it's ummmm... 4 AM and I should be dreaming.

       Things that make you go hmmmm   ...Like where the hell is my ATM card.  I found it but I was quite flustered between the bank and my room and for about 15 minutes while I checked every pocket in every pair of jeans I had.  I remembered using it at the ATM on Vine St. and at the Chevron in Florence and it was oddly in my jean jacket wrapped in a twenty dollar bill(the way I put it away on Vine St.).  Next question is how the hell did I use it at the gas station if it is still wrapped in a twenty?  Perhaps I used my drivers license to pay for gas and they just didn't catch it.  The guy was half asleep anyway.  Maybe I used it at the gas station and put it back the way I had found it.  I dunno.  I'm perplexed.  Exasperated.  Pissed off, lol.  Oh well, all is well that ends without having to fight vampires or zombies.  I'm currently working my way through a very, very large box of Junior Mints.  All my Reese's eggs are gone and I am starting on good candy #2.  I will soon be down to just bad candy and that is where it really gets interesting.  In a strange turn of events I purposly left some of the bad candy in my Easter basket hoping the bunny would get the hint...or maybe just use the same ones next time.  It could save him some cash which he could use for a night on the town with Mrs. Bunny and then he could repay me next year with extra Reese's eggs.  Sounds like a good plan to me.

       I want to be someone else or I'll explode   Especially someone who's nose isn't runny today.  I slept for most of the day today and when I wasn't sleeping I was thinking about it.  Perhaps I'm sick.  I can't tell anymore.  I had a somewhat funny chat last night with my brother and Jim about women.  Especially how some will call and tell you every little detail of their day and you can't get a word in edgewise.  Jim recently had 14 missed calls in 3 hours from some girl he hadn't even gone out with yet.  That's impressive.  She was cute too, but she ruined it before it even got started.  We also discussed how much guys don't like the phone and how we only call people to give them a bit of important information.  Then we put an end to it as quickly as possible.  Guys just simply would rather chat with someone in person if it is at all possible.  I can understand long conversations if you're a long distance apart, but most of us would rather meet up somewhere so we can check you out too.  That's really all it is.  Guys forget stuff like how attractive you are and you must remind them frequently.  Oh, and guys like to feel useful too.  I'd gladly buy dinner every night and discuss how my day was.  I get to keep you from starving to death and we can chat at the same time.  How's that?  Anyways, I'm out.  You think about it.

       I can't take my eyes off of you   Well. Damien had a great show tonight.  Played pretty much the same show as the last time I saw him (which is pretty much everything they have written so far).  I still have yet to see  a show with Lisa (the incredible backup singer).  Which is disappointing to say the least.  I played some basketball today (first time in about 5 years) and I was pretty rough.  I was, however, not as rough as some.  Which was a relief.  The rest of this weekend was spent playing Madden 2004 on the Xbox with my brother and Jim.  I am the sack expert and not much else.  We still win most of the time (possibly always, but sometimes the computer just decides you are going to lose).  I feel I'm cutting things a bit short, but I must get a little sleep tonight.  So Goodnight.

       ...and drivin' through the night   Ahhhhh, the three day weekend has begun.  My moblog is up but I can't send pictures to it yet(must call Cingular and such).  I get to go shopping with Mom tomorrow.  It will be fun.  My brother is going too which makes me feel bad because I always end up finding more clothes.  Oh well, I can't help it if I'm an expert shopper.  Work was good today.  Very little irritation.  It should be this good every day.  REALLY, it should.  Missed Coheed tonight, obviously, but I'll get over it.  I've still got Damien Rice to look forward to.  Goodnight.

      Wow, my computer says that it's 72F outside!  I would be outside enjoying it but I'm too busy checking it on my computer.  I was gonna start a moblog (picture blog) today but Text America is having problems.  I think I might need to budget how many pics I send to my blog per week since multimedia messages costs $$$.  I still haven't found out how much it costs yet.  I think there is an advert in my garbage can for them.  No, I'm not gonna do that.  I'll just wait till they send me another advert.  That's why I keep them around anyways.  It's no secret.  Josh has the day off work today which is gonna be nice.  I desperately need a break from that guy.  He's found a way to get to my every last nerve I've got and I'm losing my cool with him.  Today should be very relaxing regardless of our workload (especially if I quit and go see Coheed, lol).  Oh well, time to go in and see what I can work out.

       I will not take these things for granted   So, I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the movie) today and Toad the Wet Sprocket is definately on the soundtrack.  It's strange how you never think of two things happening around the same moment in time (yet alone the same decade) but I suppose some things are timeless and some wear their age on their sleeves.  I wish I had been more into Toad before they had broken up.  I definately liked them and loved the stuff that was on the radio but never REALLY got into their music/bought an album until a few years ago.  I really wish Glen Phillips (the former lead singer) would come back to play a show around here ( I think that's what I'm getting at with this post).  The intimate, acoustic, one man show is such a wonderful thing to watch.  Especially when it's a good (talented) artist that really doesn't need anyone else to sound good.  THE END.

      BTW, yesterday was 04-04-04 which only happens once every hundred or so years or something.  Michael Stipe said something about 11/11 (the date that the REM concert was) and how whoever you spent it with was special.  I dunno about all that, but I stayed home all day yesterday.

      Sometimes I go out at night to the driving range by my house and just walk.  It amazes me that if you walked there during the day you would get pelted by golf balls.  You can, however, twist your ankle by stepping on one.  It's just the way life is.  Something makes you feel invincible and then reminds you that you are an IDIOT.  Makes me laugh though.  Coheed is this Thursday(not the band, lol) and I still don't know if I will be able to make it.  The problem is that if I ask for the day off (or to work first shift that day) I can't really call in.  Well, I suppose it's just one of those signs that you're growing up and you can't make all the shows that you would like... because you have a job.  Damien Rice on Saturday will definately happen though.  You can bet your ass.  He just better have the full lineup so they can play the Eskimo Song in it's full glory.  "Touch me Not with your hands But in a way that I can feel Touch me Not with your hands But with your soul"  good night/morning.

      Everybody's working for the weekend.  Too bad I have too work on mine.  Yep, 5 hours tomorrow.  I shouldn't complain since it was gonna be 8 hours.  I wanna vacation.  Actually a new job would really make me happy right now.  This one has me too spoiled, though, to get just any ol' job.  Eventually my patience will end and my happiness will get the best of me.  As it always does in these matters (and as it should).  My new work boots are hurting my ankles.  I think I fixed them by cutting some elastic that holds the toungue down, but I can't be sure since anything that touches them hurts.  Enough about work, lets talk about my new amp.  Wow, I haven't mentioned that yet.  Perhaps that's because I haven't posted since I got it.  Well, it's a Vox and it sounds sooooooo good.  It's everything I've ever dreamed of in an amp:  amp modeling, effects, delay (oh how I love delay), and most of all it has tubes (which you just can't imitate).  It even makes my strat sound good (and that's pretty difficult).  Of course, now I need a new guitar and that damn footswitch.  It will sound godly when I get my Gibson (lol) or maybe that Ibanez I keep playing at Guitar Center and Sam Ash.  Anyway, I must go now.

      I almost lost my "special stuff" in a horrible accident at work today.  It involved a belt, a roller, and the front of my pants.  I'm sure you can picture it.  At least everything came out alright.  The thing should have had a cover over it.  It's supposed to have a cover over it.  I also almost smashed my hand real good.  That one would have been my own stupid fault.  It was definately an accident prone day.  Well, there are accident prone days and then there are days where you really do hurt yourself repeatedly.  I'm ever grateful it wasn't one of those.  It's long weekend time!! Lets party and such.  I'm not sure what the plan is for this weekend.  It's usually either have lots of fun or head back early when I don't know what's going on.  I do need to do laundry.  Perhaps Monday will be laundry day.  Anyway, I'm out.

      I love contrast more than anything.  It surprises me everytime that something is both good and bad at the same time.  I love to see something modern alongside something ancient or something man-made in the middle of nature.  It is almost wrong and at the same time right.  *ding* bedtime!!

       OH MY, he's got a KNIFE...   ...or a fork.  Here are my ratings(between 1 and 5) for different ways to smash your finger.   In a car door          - between 3 and 5 (5 if the child protection is on and noone is around so you have to roll the window down and open it from the outside.  That is as long as you don't have power windows and the keys in you're pocket.  Then you're totally screwed.)   Sledge hammer          - 5 (Definitely  one of the worst ways to smash your finger.)   Someone else's foot    - between 1 and 5 depending on what the foot is wearing.   Aircraft landing gear  - 17 (Not only would it hurt the most but it would be the most difficult to explain)  I think I'm done.  Goodnight (actually it's search for food time for me).

      I owe an explanation.  My friend Kate passed away this week.  We were quite close for about 3 years then we had a falling out and haven't talked for almost 2 years.  It makes it somewhat worse when you're last memory of someone was an immature argument.  Still we had many good times and I wish she were still here.  I cried earlier today for the first time in a long time.  I almost did on my way to work as I listened to the song I posted earlier.  The line "..And you know there's only one more time you'll hear about her" made me shiver.  It was weird too.  I was thinking, "Glen will help" and popped the CD in and (it's pretty scratched up) the first song that would play was that one(#10).  So I get to work and hold it back and go back home.  Then Ben called and we decided to meet up before the service.  After that I locked my door to listen to some music and pout and my Dad comes up to offer his condolences and give me a hug (thanks Dad).  As soon as I closed the door and turned I hear, "may angels lead you in" coming from my headphones and, wow, I still remember how.

       Train Wreck   She looked just like a train wreck That could've been avoided In a third world country By a long stretch of farmland Where the waters had run high And the topsoil down the river So that next year there would be no crops. . . She was as desperate as a salesman At a company that's folding But they haven't told the staff yet That they're bankrupt and backordered And they're funneling the pensions To the CEO's back pocket So in one week they'll have nothing  I miss you girl. I hope you're fine Good luck, love Or goodbye  She's the girl from central casting Always played the sweet young orphan Or the hooker with the heart of gold But she got her SAG card pulled And turns tricks now on Cahuenga She tells herself it's research For her next and greatest role  I miss you girl, I hope you're fine Good luck, love Or goodbye  She'll call you up just to hear you say she's fine Then she's gone away And you know there's only one more time You'll hear about her again  Well it's life informing art informing life again Like every stupid kid That thinks that they're the first in pain The first to rip themselves apart The first to try and live without a heart  I miss you girl, I hope you're fine Good luck, love Or goodbye I want to see your face, even hear your lies Good luck, girl Or goodbye Goodbye   -by Glen Phillips

      I let her go.  This is the worst day ever.  I don't know what to do.  Part of me just wants to pretend that this never happened.  To run away from it.  Imagine that I might just bump into her again somewhere.  There is nothing I can do now.  My decision is now a permanent one.  I must go now.

      This weekend I clean.  No parties.  Cleaning and organizing my room is the order of business.  It's no small order since I have enough stuff to furnish a small apartment.  I rearranged the furniture and I seem to have more space.  That's always a good thing.  I went shopping today and got my Mom a bamboo plant for Mother's Day and my Dad a mouse for his laptop for his birthday.  I got myself some Sharpies (the extra fine point multicolored ones) and some deodorant (Degree - shower clean scent, I hope you don't care).  Tomorrow the agena is as such - Church, laundry, clean my bathroom and finish my room.  Oh, and spend time with Mom, of course.    Don't you just love it when you give something you don't use away to someone and they cherish it more than you did.  I don't really have a situation in mind, but it's a great feeling.  Then you take it back from them and they cry.  LOL, jk.

       ...And may I have this dance?   The weekend went well.  Bobby puked.  Markey puked the next day, as always.  I ate a caterpillar.  It was a party.  The next day Ben, Brandon and I went to Sam Ash and played around for about 3 hours.  It's like Discovery Zone for musicians.  I didn't buy anything this weekend and I don't really need to.  I do need new shoes.  Seriously, I haven't bought any for about 6 months now.    Here's some words that are spoken rhythmically with guitar, bass, and drums by the band Penfold to create music.  I would post the guitar chords but that would make no sense.  BTW, it's called "May I Have This Dance".  It's a shame they broke up.  :(   "I remember it was cold outside Waiting for spring for two hearts filled with hope And I remember it was cold out And may I have this dance And I hope it could last for the rest of my life Are you still afraid, the promises that I made in these hands These hands will never move And may I have this dance I'd pull you closer and you'd feel me tremble I could show you the world, just take my hand and I'd never let go I'd never let go"

      This weekend was craziness.  I hung out at Jessica's for a while on Friday night.  It was uber fun.  I won at pool pretty much all because of my partner.  Then I watched everyone play drinking games for a while.  Afterwards I headed over to Ben's but a phone call revealed that he was up at Radio Down watching Scallywagon.  They hadn't started playing so I decided to head on up there to watch the show.  They played pretty well for a last minute, "I don't care" show.  Still, everyone had a blast.  Then we headed over to Ben's house for some drinkin'.  It was a blast.  I'm not too sure who all was there so I won't try to name everyone.  I do know that Bobby was wasted and "just being silly" a lot.  Carlos got his shorts removed by Markie and then Bobby almost tackled him into me on the couch.  I wasn't having any of that fiasco so I jetted out to the porch for a smoke.  Markie and I were foiled again in fixing sandwiches because there was only a heel left in the bag.  Markie and Justin slept outside possibly because I took Ben's bed again after he crashed in the recliner.  We started drinking again that morning because we are stupid.  I think I had 2 before giving up on that plan.  Ben was going over to Hooter's (Jeremy) and Amber's new house to lay some carpet (no, literally lay some carpet perverts!!) and I had nothing better to do so I decided to join.  So after some Chipotle we headed over there.  It is a super-cool house with a big backyard and a neat attic space (with super ugly flooring) that is the future master bedroom.  I was not much help since I hadn't done carpet before but I'll do better next time.  It still came out looking excellent.  So we head over to Brandon's to pack up for their show.  Then we go to Frank's parent's house to pick up a grill to cook out on at the show.  So we're hanging out at the show and Andrew brings up the idea of getting a bottle of Jager so we don't have to pay so much to drink.  I decide this is a brilliant idea so we head to a liquor store to get that.  I end up getting the big Liter bottle because I always like the larger item.  It is cost efficient.  Well, we started with a plastic cup and then went to taking shots then I start taking shots by myself.  Then the bottle is empty which is somewhat of a relief to me since the lid didn't go back on at all and I was keeping it in my bag.  I also very much wanted to ditch my bag in someone's vehicle (since I wasn't driving, of course).  This all goes down over the course of an hour (which is not good it turns out).  All I really remember after that is being in Radio Down's bathroom for a moment, being in Ian's car for a moment, the hospital, and Ian's house.  I remember the shower at Ian's house being particularly unpleasant and trying to drink coffee and water making me quite sick to my stomach.  I remember walking with Ian's mom and Ben (at which moment I adamantly wanted to sleep).  Well, I was mostly being carried at first and then I reached the conciousness to walk on my own.  Then my brother showed up in Jim's car and took me to Jim's house.  I don't remember how I got to Jim's bed but I remember waking up there.  First thing I realized was that I didn't have my cell phone.  I really wanted to call people and apologize and such but it WAS 5AM and that probably was a bad idea.  So anyways, to make it short I survived.    I had a hell of a time getting all my stuff (cell phone, car, backpack, and a pair of shoes) back on Sunday.  I did eventually get everything back and even had some time to watch the race.  Then we played poker (Texas Hold Em) at Jim's.  I won $14 on pocket 3s.  A bunch of luck but much fun.  Then me and Bradley headed home.  Another near miss happened on the  way.  Some crazy assed deer runs diagonally in front of me while I'm cruising at 75 Mph.  I swerved and barely missed.  I was lucky it was heading in the same general direction I was so I had some time to react.  Crazy fucker needs to realize that's a good way to get yourself killed.  I guess I'm not one to talk though.  After such a weekend it's a good idea to chill out for a few days and that's my plan.  I may head back up tomorrow to see the Suicide Girls at the Southgate House but I hear it's not that interesting so....we'll see.  Anyways, I hope everyone's weekend was better than mine.

      So the fan that cools the power supply in my computer is not working.  This makes the computer overheat and automatically shutdown.  My fix for this is to duct tape a case fan on top of the nonworking one.  This doesn't work too well and it falls off regularly.  Earlier today I had a fairly long post to add up here and it fell off and I accidently turned the power supply off and destroyed the post.  That is why I haven't updated about my weekend and such.  If I feel like it tonight I will do a rewrite but don't count on it.  I'll probably just go on with my life.

      I am apparnetly going to watch the qualifying for the race at Kentucky Speedway tomorrow.  I suppose it's still cause to drink some beer.  I hope they have an assortment of domestics on tap.  Hahaha, I'm sarcastic.  Anyways, I've never been to a NASCAR event before.  I'm not sure what to bring.  Maybe a radio so I actually know what the hell is going on.  I dunno, I suppose I'll just wing it and bring myself and some cash.  Well, I must run. I'll be back on Sunday.

      I really must request that people download Windows updates and scan for viruses.  It is affecting my web surfing and blogging abilities.  Take me for example: I recently scanned for viruses for the first time since I got my new hard drive and had 13 viruses.  Well, one was a hacking tool (I didn't know those counted) but that's still a crapload.  Anyways, that's my public service announcement.  Today was not extremely eventful.  I mowed the yard, watched the brat(sister) while my parents went to church, and cleaned (a little) my car.  I got jumped by the parents when they came home and saw me cleaning.  My Dad decides he's going to reattach my side mirror and my Mom comes out and just sits in my car.  So I decide to take my cupholder (which was full of change) upstairs to empty and clean out.  When I return the story was much the same so I just gave up.  I was obviously being set up for some sort of "talk".  I would assume it was about something "bad" that I did although I can't think of anything I've done.  They haven't mentioned anything so I'd assume it to actually be good.  All I know is that I don't mind doing work and I don't mind being social, but I hate when the two collide.  I find it impossible to give the appropriate attention to either.  So I'll hopefully get to finish cleaning my car tomorrow.  Goodnight.

      I actually left the house today.  I went to St. Matthews Mall.  It is one of my favorite malls because it has my name on it.  I walked the length of the mall about 4 times before I decided to look at one of those maps.  I haven't been in that mall in a few years so I had no idea where anything was.  I actually thought it would be easier to look around and find what I was looking for.  I was looking for the FYE store because they had The Simpsons season 1, 2, and 3 for $14.99 each.  I finally found it along an entrance.  Silly me, I thought they only put non-shopping type places down those.  Maybe a bank, haircut place, or sit-down restaurant.  OK, maybe I'm a bit frustrated because I walked past one of those maps on my way in and thought, "Man, I don't wanna be one of those mall noobs who check those things out.  I'll find it.  I must not advertise myself to the opposite sex as a man who can't find his way around a mall.  Especially the closest mall to his house."  So anyways, I get to FYE and get my DVDs and ask nicely if they have the $5 rebate that goes with them.  He tells me that they don't and that Coconuts(also owned by their parent company) doesn't either.  This is right after he tells me how much he paid for the same DVDs(alot more).  So I don't complain and assume he is right(after all it's a great deal).  Well, guess what?  I'll tell you later, hehe.  After that... experience, I went to the Cherry Bomb(vintage clothing store) to check out their duds.  I should say that I tried to go there.  It took me 3 passes to get back on the interstate.  I need to quit getting in the other lane because it is shorter and I "might" be able to get to where I want to go.  It works sometimes, I swear.  So I passed up the Cherry Bomb twice because I don't really know where it's at on Bardstown Rd.  There's nothing much that I had to have there so I jet outta there.  I start heading home and I get the urge for some Qdoba(Chipotle with a larger menu).  So I go to the Summit (Rookwood for you Cincinnatians) and guess what's across from Qdoba?  That's right, a Coconut's Music.  I eat my fajita burito (which is fabulous!!) and head over to Coconut's.  I walk in and first thing I see is an advert for The Simpson's DVDs for $9.99 after rebate.  So I ask the guy if they have the rebates in and if they are good if you bought them at FYE.  He says yes and no in that order which somewhat infuriates me because I'm pretty sure that they are good at any of those stores.  So I leave half tempted to buy them there and return the other ones.  Of course I don't and head home where I find a copy(you can't use a copy BTW) on the internet and I was right.  I believe you also need separate reciepts(which I don't) too.  Anyway, I gave up on the matter and just decided to enjoy the DVDs at a pretty exceptional price.  That's pretty much my day or 3 hours or so of it. Hope yours was good.

      Well, nuthing much happened today.  I am currently hermiting in my room.  I do this thing where I hide in my room for like a week and I think that week is now.  There's actually alot I need to do in the outside world this week.  So I might not make it all the way through.  I've been thinking about how I've haven't dated a girl down here in Louisville yet.  That's why I need a new job.  Where I can at least see something other than men and steel.  I also prefer jobs that allow me to be creative.  Hmmm,  there's got to be something out there.

       If those guys only look at you and want you imagine how I feel.   It was a good weekend.  I didn't get to drink much at all.  I suppose that makes me a responsible person.  My PDA's battery died at some point so I lost everything that wasn't on a memory card.  That sucks.  I need to take more pictures.  Ummm, random thought... I would eat dirt if it tasted good.  Well, I think I'll take a nap.

      Well, I hate these thingies but this one looked good soooo...    You have a mysterious kiss.  Your partner never knows what you're going to come up with next; this creates great excitement and arousal never knowing what to expect.  And it's sure to end in a kiss as great as your mystery.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      So, I just woke up from a fucked up dream about a short leprechaun-ish guy who kills people by placing two fingers on them and then lightning comes down and shoots through their bodies.  I'm not kidding.  I saw him do it.  As I was running through his house to get away I came to the realization that he is the guy who rearranges things in my house at night.  He stays in the attic until everyone is asleep and then does it.  I'm not sure where I came up with that theory but it's possible.  Not likely but possible(cmon it's a dream).

      This is something that was on my PDA.  It could use some revision, but...  Can i have a drink from the love of my life whom i keep holding on to.  There's a hindsight that makes me hesitant.  Am i believing right?   Hardly knowing.  Believing you more than myself.  Simple facts marked mistakes.  Solutions feeling so fake.  It's like fate.  You find out it's wrong sometimes .  How did you ever desire it.  So love is the longest.  Can i forgive it.  What if i play ignorant?

      So, I have to work in 5 hours.  *blank stare*  I don't like the idea.  *blank stare*  It twon't even be a nice check cuz we were off Monday and apparently I don't get holiday pay.  The voices are saying, "Call in...call in...call in."  I won't though.  I've got nothing better to do between 8 AM and 4 on a Saturday.  I just hope it doesn't poop me out for the rest of the weekend.

       Episode 2   Went back to Brandon's after that.  Jessica(Brandon's Jessica) and I watched Pulp Fiction because she had never seen it all the way through.  She was deprived or something I swear, haha.  During the movie the rest of the band showed up and started practicing.  After the movie Jessica left to get cleaned up and I searched for NASCAR on the tube.  I didn't find any so I checked the website and it informed me that the race didn't start until 5:30(somehow I didn't get the memo).  Then we packed up the van and left for Josh's partey.  I rode with Markie and we had to stop by the ever generous Ryan's house to get an amp to power Brandon's new P.A. speaker's(his current one is about 1000 watts shy).  So then we were off to the Dairy Mart(maybe???) in Alexandria to meet up with the van.  It was not there, of course, and in fact they hadn't left yet.  Ben had decided that he was going to roll his own cigarettes(which blatantly looks like you're smoking pot) because that's what they do in Europe(specifically Ireland where he just got back from).  So we gave them directions and continued.   new paragraph please   So we arrived, got some food and a beer, and set up Markie's drums.  It was a cool bar/hall type place that had TVs with NASCAR on them(thank you, God!!).  A bit later the van/guys showed up and we finished setting up.  I got to show off my excellent problem solving skills when the mixer and the amp didn't have the same plugs on them.  The "stage" area only had one ungrounded plug (this is how guitar players get electrocuted) so we ran some extension cords and got enough juice.  My official title is now "general technician".  That's apparently a step up from "guitar tech" but it just seems like more work to me.  Anyways, the band played 2 sets.  One early and one late.  Both went well and sounded decent due to my Jedi training.  We brought the bubble machine which was a bad idea since it only made everything slippery and soaked Ian's amp.  Speaking of Ian's amp, it cut out about halfway through the first set and was only revived when I unplugged a fog machine on the same outlet.  He was just about to take his guitar off too, silly boy.  The parts of the party where I wasn't "working" were uber fun too.  Jimmy Johnson won the race handily, yay.  Jeff Gordon on the other hand...didn't do so well.  The keg was floated about the time that the race ended so we had to pay a small amount for drinks.  That was about the time that the family gathering was replaced by the youngsters (that doesn't include me, I have ceased to be young).  Quite a few people showed up too.  Jessica sucks at pool although she has a table in her house.  I don't understand how you can't at least be decent but no, she sucks, haha.  Amy however cheats at pool.  She was putting balls back on the table for like 15 minutes before anyone playing figured it out.  The lights went out for a second and the table looked completely rearranged.  I was worried for my life but not Amy.  Ian and I had a talk about God and we actually agreed on alot of stuff.  Amy and I then talked about finding me a girlfriend and we figured out that noone she knew would do.  Ben made fun of me for my NASCAR obsession alot.  I drank alot too.  Anyways, it was a great party.  Ian, Amy, and J.T. decided they were going to Waffle House and J.T. said I could sleep at his house.  So we go there and there are some girls at the table in front of me and some drunk, straight outta jail rednecks behind me.  The cute girl that works there isn't working either, poopies.  It was an intense meal.  The rednecks are lookin for a fight and basically trying to offend everyone in the place.  They kept talking to us way past the point where I was done.  Then some jockish guys start flirting with the girls at the other table and the rednecks are trying to start a fight over our table pretty much.  That's why we didn't sit around and chat but got the fuck outta there.  So I slept at J.T.'s which was cool, but it's always a little odd the first time you sleep at a house.  I had to change pants before I went to sleep because mine were wet from a mud puddle I jumped into (stupid me).  In the morning we smoked a cigarette with his sister(?) and went over to Brandon's.  I was going to head back home shortly after that but me and Brandon were watching VH1's most metal moment's and it was just too good.  Then I actually am about to leave and Brandon invites me to his parent's for a cookout.  How can I refuse free food?  Anyway, it's pretty much a family event but I know most of his family (Ben and his family, Tony, Debbie...).  I won twice (out of two) at cornhole but I think I will stick with frisbee golf as my main sport.  That reminds me that I need to play more frisbee golf.  Well, Ben is getting ready to leave and Frank (from Radio Down) calls and needs someone to run the door that night.  So I agree since it's $50 cash and I didn't really have anything planned.  So traffic was horrendous on the way to Covington.  I believe that is the fault of the Taste of Cincinnati but I could be wrong (I actually don't even know if that was going on on Monday).  I stopped to buy Ben cigarettes and me a Gatorade and the lady inside is super sweet telling me she had some of the same coupons that I was using and that she was gonna bring them in for some of the older ladies who come in because someday she will be like them.  Awwww.  Then I get to Radio Down at the same time as Ben (he was trying to get there quickly that's why he had me stop for smokes).  He tells me he was in a bumper thumper, a blatant lie.  Just kidding, he was but there was no damage just the usual chit-chat.  So we get there and start setting up the bar and Frank informs me that the register is downstairs (as opposed to up) since Tickets is closed and I have to make sure noone wonders in there.  This adds a twist since I am now going to have a boring night and only be able to hear the music (as opposed to seeing).  As predicted I had a boring night.  I counted to 53 on my little clicker before the night was through.  The cute girl from Waffle House came through but she didn't remember me.  I am so over her. Damn, she's too young anyways, 18, it musta slipped my mind.  I'm still holding a ketchup bottle ransom though.  In the event that I decide to be super cute and bring it back like, "I feel so guity.  I stole you're ketchup bottle and I'll do anything to make it up to you...  like make out", hahaha.  I saw a few people I knew and a few drunk people I knew but mostly people I didn't know.  Did I mention it was boring?  I'll bring a book next time.  I definitely wouldn't mind doing it again, though.  Hopefully the register will be back upstairs where it belongs.  The night ends with me and Ben cleaning up and going for grub to the Anchor Grill.  I recommend the biscuits and gravy.  They are intense.  We chatted about personal stuff that I won't mention.  Then I went home.  Sorry for the lengthy post but I started with the long version and had to finish with it.  I like long posts though.  You can actually tell the whole story instead of a synopsis.  I may do more, whatever my heart desires. So long, goodnight.

      It was a superb weekend.  Ben and I started out Saturday evening going over to Roy(Josh) and K-lub's(Caleb)for a cookout. All went well until Roy got on some rant and just wouldn't quit.  Ben woke up(he was passed out on a bean bag) and said we might have to leave.  Which I gladly said OK to.  So after talking to Roy some more we left to crash out at Ben's.  Not according to plan but better is how I would describe it.  Much better.  We woke up shortly before his family got back from camping.  They got rained on...alot.  Then it was time for breakfast.  We were gonna go to the Waffle House but we called Brandon and he was going to Garizelli's(possibly a horrible misspelling).  So we went there and had Calzones for breakfast.  Not bad.  To be continued...tomorrow.

      Well, I woke up late today and guess what had arrived from UPS?&nbsp; That's right another computer case along with the rest of my order.&nbsp; Hmmm, must be my lucky day.&nbsp; Not so much,&nbsp; two of the items I ordered didn't work out at all.&nbsp; I still come out ahead in the ordeal so I am 25% happier than when I started.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am considering sending it back but that will probably be a hassle.  I am definately ready for school to start.&nbsp; If all goes well this semester I will be one class away from my Associate's Degree.&nbsp; I'm not sure what an Associate's in Arts will get you but we'll see.&nbsp; Probably four more years getting a "real" degree.&nbsp; At least I'll have something to hang on the wall.&nbsp; Anyways, I'm starving and could probably use a shower.

      Well, I am writing this post from my PDA so I'm gonna keep it brief.   The last two weeks have been full of network and computer problems that made it nearly impossible to blog.  To start things off, a week and a half ago a lightening strike knocked out our cable modem, router, and the network port on my computer.  Then on Monday my duct tape job on the power supply of my computer falls off and it apparently overheats and fries.  At least that's  all I hope is wrong.  The real kicker comes on Tuesday when we receive hurricane type winds and a little rain.  Of course, to make sure that I can't fix any of these problems, the power goes out and stays out until Saturday evening.   At this point I have everything fixed except for my computer.  I have ordered a new case and power supply which should be here within a week.  This will have to suffice for now because I am tired of fighting with the on-screen keyboard.

      I have an enormous problem.  I can't seem to get "The District Sleeps Tonight" by The Postal Service out of my head.  It's the little bassline mostly.  I keep adding my own lyrics in my head.  Maybe I should stop listening to it although I've been listening to Muse more lately.  I guess it's not that bad.  I could have much worse songs stuck on my head.  Oh, and a big thanks to KP for burning the CD for me.  Well, that's about all that's going on in my head right now.

      I am unofficially going to school this fall.  I will officially register for classes on the 20th.  This only leaves my grants and transfer of credits in limbo but with a few phone calls that should be taken care of.  I bought a Bluetooth dongle today.  That means that my only Bluetooth device (my phone) can "talk" to my computer.  It's quite useless except that I can sync my Outlook calendar and contacts.  It will hopefully be more useful in the future once the price of Bluetooth devices comes down a bit.  I got attacked by ducks at Skyline Chili today.  Not so much attacked as there were gobs of them hangin out by the entrance.  There's a pic of them on my moblog.  I was worried that I would run one over on the way out.  If I did then I was oblivious to it.

      this girl saw my penis and said "awwww".  I heard it and thought it sounded like she had just seen a cute LITTLE puppy.  I failed to realize that puppies always get petted.  HEHE, that's my joke for the day.  I have come to the conclusion that I cannot do anything productive unless I can rock out to some tunes while doing it.  So I did the the dishes and it made a horrible mess of the floor and my shirt.  I guess I will have to stop doing the air guitar solos.

      So my parents seem to be ready to build a new house.  We looked at some land yesterday and I think they are sold on it.  The plot is much much larger than what they have now and they can pretty much build whatever they want on it.  The best feature is that there is a frisbee golf basket down by the creek.  I only hope the house doesn't get in the way so I can have a good par 4 to practice on.  I'm still not sure how much longer I plan on living here.  I suppose I should finish up school while living for free.  My little second monitor is making a horrible whining noise.  It will stop momentarily if you bang on the top of it but I'm afraid it may not last much longer.  I will certainly miss the extra desktop space but monitors are fairly cheap these days.  I would love to get another 19" so scolling between the two would be more smooth.  I was checking out the ViewSonic AirPanel yesterday.  It's totally rad.  A wireless touchscreen monitor, mmmmmmm.  I saw some bad reviews on it though so maybe not.  Something that expensive better be perfect.  I'll be heading up to the Nati today if Bradley ever wakes up so I can see if he wants to ride. I believe I'm going to Markie's for his Forth of July bash.  Anyways, right now I think I will try to get the Wireless Internet working on my phone.  Have a safe weekend.

      This weekend was fun although at parts a bit boring. I went to the Fizzgig show on Saturday. They rocked it, of course. The highlight of the night was shucking corn in the parking lot. It seems alot of my friends have no idea what shucking is. Damn city folk. After the show I headed to Jim's house because I was quite tired but he was not back from his night's activities yet. So I start to just drive around waiting for a call back when KP calls and asks if I want some Waffle House. Of course I did.  So we eat and then I finally get ahold of Jim and Brad.  They are at a friend's house down the which I assumed they would be leaving soon.  Wrong!  Well, half wrong.  They ended up going to some guys apartment and hanging out.  We watched some bootleg movies of stuff that is only in theatres now.  Didn't get out of there until about 6:30 AM.  I slept until about 4:30 on Sunday.  I woke up and cleaned up and went to Barnes & Nobles because it's the only place to go on a Sunday.  I called Cheryle because she had wanted to hang out after work.  So we go to Frische's and eat and then to Target.  Cheryle is planning on getting an apartment so we had fun looking at all the cool apartment stuff.  It's been a while since I had to look for apartment stuff so it was nice to see someone excited about it.  Then we went to the show.  They had a hell of a lineup;  Abigail, Krinj, Norust, Fizzgig and some out of town band.  I got a little tipsy and gave everyone Sharpie tattoos.  It was fun.  Cheryle got a little too drunk so Carlos and I had an interesting time getting her and her car home.  Then I headed home myself.

      So my car broke today. I should rephrase that. The battery in my car broke today. My car and it had a good six year relationship of which I was apart of four. It's sad when the original parts of your car become shot. You can't help but to think that things used to be different, better. I remember the first time the battery light came on. It was that time I parked in kinda hole thingy that was supposed to be a drain in Walmart's parking lot. That was a few hours before it rained horribly. So I'm leaving and I'm standing in water up to my ankles because that particular drain didn't work at all. So anyways, the water is up to my ankles while getting in my car and the front of my car you could almost call submerged. So I start up the little guy and it hesitantly works. I back out and start driving and the little battery light pops on telling me that the electrical system doesn't really like all that water. That was pretty much the first and only time that wonderful battery made it's presence known. We had a wonderful time together RIP.  Anyways, I got my new battery at Walmart appropriately. I really don't like driving my Dad's truck because it doesn't accelerate which gets me in trouble.  So I'm putting the battery in and I broke something (imagine that).  I broke off the piece that attaches the negative wire to the battery.  So since I needed to go to Sears to get my new glasses anyway, that's where I went to get a new piece.  So I get my new sexy glasses and go to the automotive department.  I find my part and answer a call and then notice that the girl behind the counter is smokin.  Anyway, I can't get into that without sounding dumb but I'm looking forward to breaking more stuff on my car in the near future :) .  Boy am I pathetic.  I didn't really talk to her but she was telling some other lady about trying to fix her car and it was quite hot.  That's enough of that.  BTW, I'm not in Nashville/didn't go because I needed to do other things (like fix my car) .  I AM going to Cincinnati shortly to see Fizzgig and then Fizzgig and Krinj tomorrow at the Radio Down.  Check it if you want.

      It's been a frustrating week so far. It seems like I keep messing stuff up when I need to be getting it together. Hopefully I will have a better weekend. I will be heading off to Nashville later today with the guys. They're playing a show somewhere down there. Maybe two since their Saturday show in Dayton got cancelled. I'm just not sure I want to be away for that long this weekend. Next week looks to be a busy one so I'd like some time to get stuff done. Anyone have any time for sale? I'm sure I'll get over it once I'm there. Nashville has a way of lifting the spirits. That may or may not be true. I kinda just made it up but I'm sure a change of scenery won't hurt. Anyways, I must take care of things here right now.

      The Cure show was awesome.  We didn't get in for free as I had hoped but it was almost worth the $36.  I talked to Andrew before we left and he informed me that Muse was going on at 7.  This was unfortunately at 5:30 which give me almost enough time to make the drive if I don't stop at all.  It turns out that I hit some construction on the way up and, well, had to push my little Escort to it's limits.  I had told Brandon to go ahead without me but I figured he hadn't left yet so I met him at his house.  Well, we were both starving at that point so we stopped at Wendy's and the gas station.  So we get off at the exit and stop to see how much the scalpers want for tickets.  They offer us 5th row for $50 each.  I had looked online and it said tickets were $17 to $51 so we passed thinking lawn seats were $17.  Wrong.  We end up paying the $36 at the door which is a bit more than I'm acustomed to but we could see and hear Muse playing and we couldn't turn back.  We got to see about half of their set.  They had a great light show which would have been much cooler if it had been dark.  Then we watched Interpol for their first song.  Then we went back to the second stage to get a good spot for Thursday.  I must admit I haven't listened to Thursday for about a year and a half but I was pretty impressed by their newer stuff.  The Cure was next and I can't say I'm super into the Cure.  They played their new single third which I thought was kinda odd.  Another oddity was that they played all their older hits right in the middle of their set, at least all that I could think of.  Anyway, Brandon and I left early and spotted a very strange looking tree.  It looked like it had people in the trunk.  I took some pictures which will be up shortly.  Then we rented movies and watched Waiting for Guffman until I headed home.

      So, I got this letter from school veryfying my grant moneys and there's a little more than I expected.  Turns out I qualified for a Pell Grant also.  It appears that I have more than enough to cover tuition and books now.  That makes me very, very happy:) .  So happy that to keep it going I'm going to try to go see the Cure and Muse tonight.  We made a very loose plan to get in and such while we were drunk Saturday night.  I'm not sure if the person that the plan depends most on remembered that plan.  We will find out soon enough.
