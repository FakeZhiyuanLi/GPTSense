       Long. That's all today was. I was in Moultrie all day with the band and didn't get in until like 11:30. Yep, I went to bed at like 1. So I'm really sleepy, if i make it though today at school then I'll write again this afternoon if somthing happens, but its Fitzgerald, so I doubt it will. But yes, until then. Caio!
