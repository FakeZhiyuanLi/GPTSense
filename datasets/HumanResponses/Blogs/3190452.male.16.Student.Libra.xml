       My last post was a near incoherent slap towards America's left. In the interests of balance therefore, I may as well present some of the more amusing idiocy from America's right. These are all genuine e-mails received by Left Wing websites (with proper liberals and everything):  (By the way, if you are offended by the repeated use of strong language, probably best to look away)   "Alright you queer Pinko Communist, So you like Socialism do y'all? You wanna pay for other bums health care fine with me you damn faggot. But I refuse to live in a socity ran by the United Nations and the New World Order. Bubba and his Queer pal Bradey wanna take ours guns do they? Well I have an Ar-15 That would like to discuss that with you and your fag loving Clinton, Read the bible you queer faggot You also appear to hate the Death Penalty, Well that is all that keeps us above Animals like the Canadians and Fag French Infact we should expand the death penalty to include anyone who does not accept Christ the Savior who died for gay fags like you you bloody queer, You are forgeting you asshole it was your beloved Government that MURDERED all the people in Waco Texas and MURDERED the wife of Randy Weaver one of the greatest Americans of all times, The whites are the superior race. all the Liberal trash are nothing next to the Arrians, Take a look at my website and find the Lord Queerboy, Maybe take a look at my website. www.godhatesfags.com"   Yeah that's good old fashioned Christian tolerance all right.  *Rolls eyes*   "Mike, I'm from the Midwest, have a middle class job, been married for some 25 years. You should know, however, that given the chance to place a liberal homo like you back in the promised land..."hello! taxi!"   Get out of America. Now. "  Mike, you silly fag! Wow, ever since Bill signed the "queers can't marry bill", not to much activism out there, huh?  Mike, have a suggestion for ya: call up Barney Frank, ask for a double date with his number one squeeze, and go f*%& yourselves. First one to develop AIDS wins.  Here's a special twist: If the oldest coc&%$$^ s*%#$# to develop AIDS was around during the Reagan admin, blame it on the Republicans! If the concept works, sell it to the B'Nai Beboring!  Rush rules. Hillary does 4-6. Bill becomes Babs love slave. Israel continues to persecute...everyone.  Black women who make more money with bastard children than they do with a married employed husband.   How do I find a picture of you? So that if, by the grace of God, I should chance stumble upon your AIDS ridden carcass, I could place Christian dollars in your swollen eye sockets?  For the love of God, Mike, develop AIDS and take a cocktail that doesn't work.  Trust me, God hates you."   More Christian tolerance, and the concept that someone that stands up for homosexual rights must be one themselves. Interesting.   "to bad you don't have enough grey matter to realize that idiot liberals like you will be the downfall of this country. rush is right, you can pretend to prove him wrong but fail. every time i look into my son's eyes i pray for the death of all liberals. his generation can not handle or pay for liberal ideology. of couse you don't care about children, as long as what you do makes you feel less guilty. someday you liberals should look back at history. remember rome and greece. if you have your way america will surley fall. then believe me you and your cohorts will pay for our demise."    Illegible, and thinks the fall of Rome was due to liberals. So not the poor position of Imperial forces and the hiring of German Cavalrymen Raiders to protect the capital wasn't then?   "ITS BECAUSE OF LIBERAL THINKING AND MENTALITY LIKE YOURS THAT THIS COUNTRY IS SO IN DEBT.IF OUR LIBERAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT WOULD FALL OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH IT WOULD ONLY PLEASE ME. ITS BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF THAT AMERICA IS ON THE DECLINE. WHEN PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO DESICRATE OUR NATIONAL SYMBOL AND HAVE HOMOSEXUAL SEX IN THE STREETS. THE DECLINE OF THE U.S. IS DUE TO OUR POT SMOKING,WOMANIZING,HOMOSEXUAL"POLITICALLY CORRECT" MILITARY HATING, LIBERAL GOVERNMENT. PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE WHY OUR DEBT IS SO HIGH. ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS TAX THE HELL OUT OF THE WORKING CLASS AND GIVE IT TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES WHO DO NOTHING BUT HAVE REVOLUTIONS. YOU GIVE IT DRUG USERS WHO DONT WANT TO WORK FOR A LIVING. YOU GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TO LAZY FEND FOR THEMSELVES. THAT IS WHY OUR COUNTRY IS WERE IT IS TODAY BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU."   Nice to see that insanity is back in passion this year. Lies and incorrect assumptions do not make an argument. Much less a logical one.   "Would you please explain to me why every liberal is a lire, every liberal without exception. For no liberal well survive in the market of ideas unless they lie and lie big, ??? If every liberal was honest about there ideas liberalism would be dead the next day. So you see Conservative ideologue can not survive apart from truth.  Children are taugh from scholl liberal ideologue when they are not reading books they get from movies, and if not there getting it from the news media, who for the most part are very liberal, Sam Donalson, and billions of dollars later America is still a conservative Country Yea, this has just got to frost your hide. "   Yes and honest liberalism didn't end slavery, grant universal sufferage and all those other fun things.  Well that was fun, a fairly amusing selection of letters and proof that crazy people exist regardless of ideology apparently. Though strictly speaking these guys are probably worse.  Probably the sort of people who think Bush is a communist or something daft like that.  Cheers.

       Time for some current affairs. Today's topic:  Liberalism, the Hijacking of.  Recently I paid a visit to what could quite easily be described as a fairly scary right-wing site. They were American, they were mobile and they were angry. Angry about America's Left, who they decry as hating America (and it's little buddy, Israel). I read for a while and realised that in a strange way they have actually managed to put together one decent point. Some of the liberals in America are crazy, hypocritical people. I'm inclined to agree. America's left wing "liberals" exist in three forms as far as I can see.   1. What we in Europe call a "conservative". 2. Your average common or garden liberal (not common). 3. Crazy hippies (the subject of this rant).  This third brand of liberals is extremely interesting because they are in no sense of the word, actually liberal.  lib·er·al    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (lbr-l, lbrl) adj.   1. Not limited to or by established, traditional, orthodox, or authoritarian attitudes, views, or dogmas; free from bigotry.  2. Favoring proposals for reform, open to new ideas for progress, and tolerant of the ideas and behavior of others; broad-minded.  3. Of, relating to, or characteristic of liberalism.  4. Liberal Of, designating, or characteristic of a political party founded on or associated with principles of social and political liberalism, especially in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States.   Let's take a look at AmLibs versus ClassLibs as defined here.  Not limited to traditional attitudes they may be, but bigotry is a different matter. Go to a peace rally some time. Really. A lot of people will be acting normally, but watch what happens if a group of conservatives arrive of the scene, they'll be booed, insulted and in some cases, attacked. This seems rather contradictory for those who espouse peace and freedom of speech, not to mention being predjudiced against the beliefs of conservatives. The second point in the dictionary definition deals with this as well "tolerant of the ideas and behaviour of others", yes, of course, but not if they are right wing, or a zealot, or a Zionist.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not particularly fond of any of the above groups but it's only civil to at least avoid attacking them for pities sake. This bastardisation of liberalism by some to mean "lots of social welfare, affirmative action and political correctness" is horrible and blights the name of proper liberals.  Ill informed rant over.  Cheers.

       I've decided to exchange this internet-word-thing for a paper equivalent. If anyone cares I'll be greatly surprised.

       These past two weeks have been rather dull. Much like everyone else I went to see Shrek 2 recently, and much like everyone else, I liked the cat. Hooray.  However, that is more or less the extent of my doing-stuffification, most of the time I stayed home and either wallowed in my own misery and self loathing or played System Shock 2 (Geekyness +1). I do not even currently have gainful employment, given that I cannot truly be arsed. Work may or may not be better than self loathing, I'm not quite sure, but I'm willing to bet that it isn't.
