      The light in the day The kiss of the wind The touch of your hand... Softly against my skin  My lips are waiting In patient time This moment of silence  As your lips meet mine  My breath is gone I'm flying free Holding you As you hold me  Time is stopped Everything lasts The futures within us And so is the past  Nothing else matters Now that were free, Holding you, As you hold me.   Roses are dead  roses are dead  violets are to im still in love  but not with you you thought you hurt me  and made me cry but i was in love with another guy simply cuz you got no class all you can do is kiss my ass you sit around and talk your sh*t so f**k you and you lil ass dick you thought you left me  but i left you you tell your homies you played me like a b*tch and i tell my gurls you have a lil dick you said you loved me  but it wasnt true well guess what mother f**ker i played you to  ur the one i wont forget  of all the boys that I have met ur the one i wont forget and if i die before u do ill go to heaven and wait for u and if ur not there on judgment day ill know u went the other way ill give the angles back there wings and risk the lost of everything just to prove my love is true  ill go to hell just for u   What friends seem to do  Take all the colors that you see, and set them right infront of me.  The shades of red, and yellow are fine, but the blue, and black, aren't favorites of mine.  They show me a side of you, I never see, and now I'm aware, is this the key?  The key to opening up to yourself? Or maybe its also for me as well.  I'll never know why, or even how come, but I know you'll be the only one.  But its okay, because I forgive you anyway

      Forgiveness is letting go of the hope that the past could have been any different  Get out right now, Its the end of you and me, Its to late, and I cant wait for you to be gone, Cause I know, about her And i wonder, how i bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right but you were just a waist of time.                                                                                                                                                                            Why are roses the symbol of love if roses always die"  "You don't love someone cause they're beautiful, they're beautiful cause you love them"

      Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am young again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am fun again  However far away, I will always love you However long I stay, I will always love you Whatever words I say, I will always love you I will always love you  Sometimes I feel | Like I don't have a partner | Sometimes I feel | Like my only friend | Is the city I live in | The city of Angels | Lonely as I am | Together we cry ||| I drive on her streets | 'Cause she's my companion | I walk through her hills | 'Cause she knows who I am | She sees my good deeds | And she kisses me windy | I never worry | Now that is a lie  __________________ Spiders legs for eye lashes, and charcoal round your eyes. Pierce your ears and paint your lips. Wrap yourself in glitter, and wrap yourself in lace. It does nothing other than, hide your pretty face. Even though you’re hideous, you’re beautiful you see. A cracked soul can be hidden, just not if it’s me. So talk here on your cell phone, and use your accented lines. Even if it is just, another lame disguise. They say they see behind the image, but the image is all they know. So keep it up forever now, life’s really just a show.     summer nights,dirnken fights, mistakes are made,did we live it right?  in peace, sons bury there fathers; in wars, fathers bury their sons. and in the end, the love you take... is equal to the love you make. do you see your heros as gousts?  its on like donkey kong playin with his ding dong!!!  ♥...close my eyes...♥ ♥...let the whole thing pass me by...♥ ♥...there is no time to waste asking why...♥  ♥...i'll run away with you by my side. ♥   Never knew I could feel like this Like I've never seen the sky before I want to vanish inside your kiss Seasons may change, winter to spring But I love you, until the end of time    I rememeber the look in your eyes... when i told you that this was goodbye. you were beggin me not tonight, not here.. not now.. were lookin up at the same night sky, keep pretendin the sun will not rise. be together for one more night somewhere.. some how!  I was a wayward child  With the weight of the world That I held deep inside Life was a winding road And I learned many things Little ones shouldn't know  But I closed my eyes Steadied my feet on the ground Raised my head to the sky And though time's rolled by Still I feel like that child  As I look at the moon Maybe I grew up a little too soon"-MC

            muffin joke  okay,  so there were these two muffins being cooked in an oven. One muffin turned to the other one and said, "Damn its so hot in here!" The other muffin replies, "OMG TALKING MUFFIN!"  Here's a Question...  I don't really know where this post should go, so I'll put it here and let the mods decide:  When you tell someone to "shut the fuck up", what are you really telling them to do? I mean, what exactly is "the fuck" that you want shutted up? And why is it that that person has to shut "the fuck" up? Why can't you do it yourself?!   How can you hide from what never goes away?  When we were together you always said you would die for me. Now that we are apart I think it is time you kept your promise.  ¤I’ve waited patiently for the one Who can quench my thirst. Seduce my mind and you can have my body. Find my soul, and Im yours forever.¤   Pass the poupon  (This is a true story.) If you have children you will probably relate to this father.  As ham sandwiches go, it was perfection. A thick slab of ham, a fresh bun, crisp lettuce and plenty of expensive, light brown, gourmet mustard. The corners of my jaw aching in anticipation, I carried it to the table in our backyard, picked it up with both hands but was stopped by my wife suddenly at my side.  "Hold Johnny (our six-week-old son) while I get my sandwich," she said.  I had him balanced between my left elbow and shoulder and was reaching again for the ham sandwich when I noticed a streak of mustard on my fingers.  I love mustard.  I had no napkin.  I licked it off.  It was not mustard.  No man ever put a baby down faster. It was the first and only time I have sprinted with my tongue protruding. With a washcloth in each hand, I did the sort of routine shoeshine boys do, only I did it on my tongue.  Later (after she stopped crying from laughing so hard) my wife said, "Now you know why they call that mustard..."Poupon.'"     there's not a [star] in the sky that can equal to the [sparkle] in your e y e s  holy mary full of grace bless my babyz gorgeous face bless hisz hair which tends to curl keep him safe him other girls bless his arms that hold me strong and keep his hands where they belong  The Blank Theory - Addicted I don't mind pretending I'm someone else Whoever you want me to be As long as I'm inside you You'll never want me to leave   why WOMEN are happier than men  1) no one expects us to open up ur doors or get ur coats 2) we dont have to buy engagement rings 3) we dont use cheesy pick up lines that backfire horribly 4) its easy for a girl to change her look  5) we can do anything you can, but you cant do everything we can   __________________ the three INTOLERABLE I's---  ignorance immaturity idiocey   1. can wear a skirt or a dress without anyone looking at us weird 2. dont have to shave our face 3. dont pee standing up 4. the toilet sit is always down 5.

      People never really say what they mean. Why? When your being truthful and telling someone they look okay in those pants, why not just tell them they look fat.. if they really do? I mean your lieing to them, dont be afraid to be brutally honest. CAN U BRING URSELF TO TELL UR BEST FRIEND THAT HER NEW BOY FRIEND IS CHEATING ON HER????? SO WHAT IF SHES IN LOVE SO SHES SAYS  BUT THE TRUTH U CANT SEEM TO BRING URSELF TO TEL HER RIGHT?IT RUNS THOUGH UR HEAD ABOUT TEN MILLION TIMES UNTILL U  TELL HER BUUT U CANT WHAT TO DO NOW? U GO CRAZY WITH THE  THOUGHT OF IT ITS TO MUCH PRESSURE TOO KEEP  BUT U DONT WANNA BREAK HER HEART ................

        WELCOME  TO MY WORLD OF HATE AND LOVE   I HAVE SOME INFO HERE ABOUT LIFE FROM MY POINT OF VIEW NONE ELSES IF U DONT LIKE IT BAD LUCK SO HERE SO STUFF READ IT AND ENJOY................  I will then trust the love untold  Which not my worth nor want has bought Which woooed me young and woos me old, And to this evening hath me brought,  -Henry David Thoreau "Inspiration"  how can i stand here with you  and not be moved by you?  would you tell me  how could it be  any better than this?It's just a bad dream... ♥  rthe flowers in the graveyard are all goner [her throat is soft][her lips are red]  [her thighs are white][her heart is dead]  ♥My heart bleeds through your soul Don't look at me.  God is a comedian, playing to an audience too afraid to laugh.  All things are part of God's plan. Even the most disheartening setbacks. They are all part of the plan.  Grieve not for the dead, for the dead feel no pain. Instead, weep for the living who heal to hurt again.    Fears are souveniers you never lose. The past is never far. Did you lose yourself somewhere out there? Did you get to be a star? And don't it make you sad To know that life is more than who you are? You grew up way too fast. Now there's nothing to believe Reruns all become your history.  ~Don't interupt me when I'm talking to myself~  Rhythym Is A Dancer, It's A Soul's Companion We can't keep thinking about the past- And worrying about the future-We gotta live life for now-Gotta grab the moment-Make it last somehow- Let's pretend yesterday never was-& tomorrow never will be-Make believe that here & now-Is all that the 2 of us need-  I believe what I believe is what makes me what I am.   "I am so smart!-S-M-R-T!"   Raise up the ghosts of the dead- I won't die like them Push past the point of raw emotion-I will breathe Exist with a broken spirit- I will die complete Ignore what the angel's say- Enjoy that special place where the demons speak to me Wont, pick out the lining, of my coffin yet Unless I'm sure this color satin is me Better yet go with crushed velvet That way I'll be damned sure to enjoy eternity My daily life writes the eulogy Engraved on tombstone diaries Laid to rest by the passing of time Seems to be that even love can die And the rituals, that fade away And the roses, that cease to be laid And to me it clearly appears that we're already one foot in a very shallow grave I WILL LIVE MY LIFE WITH PASSION  YOU LIVE LIKE YOUR ALREADY DEAD As each day dies are we living to the next Or passing on in the twilight.  Broken - 12 Stones 'Cause I'm broken You know I need you now Deep inside I'm broken See the way I live I know, I know your heart is broken when I turn away I need to be broken Take the pain away. For a second I wish the tide  Would swallow every inch of this city  As you gasp for air tonight  I'd scream this song right in your face If you were here  I swear I wont miss a beat  Cause I never  Never have before  From up here the city lights burn  Like a thousand miles of fire  And I'm here to sing this anthem  Of our dying day  I act like shit don't phase me Inside it drives me crazy My insecurities could eat me alive But then I see my baby Suddenly I'm not crazy...  i'm not supposed to love you, in not supposed to care. I'm not supposed to live my life, wishing you were there. I am not supposed to wonder where you are, or what you do, but i just cant help it, i am still in love with you

         Lo   ve crap  If you're not married yet, share it with a friend. If you are married, share it with your spouse or other married couples . . . and reflect on it. An African proverb states, "Before you get married, keep both eyes open, and after you marry, close one eye." Before you get involved and make a commitment to someone, don't let lust, desperation, immaturity, ignorance, pressure from others or a low-self esteem make you blind to warning signs. Keep your eyes open, and don't fool yourself that you can change someone or that what you see as faults aren't really that important. Once you decide to commit to someone, over time their flaws, vulnerabilities, pet peeves, and differences will become more obvious. If you love your mate and want the relationship to grow and evolve, you've got to learn how to close one eye and not let every little thing bother you. You and your mate have many different expectations, emotional needs, values, dreams, weaknesses, and strengths. You are two unique individual children of God who have decided to share a life together. Neither one of you are perfect, but are you perfect for each other? Do you bring out the best in each other? Do you compliment and compromise with each other, or do you compete, compare, and control? What do you bring to the relationship? Do you bring past relationships, past hurt, past mistrust, past pain? YOU CAN'T TAKE SOMEONE TO THE ALTAR TO ALTER THEM. You can't make someone love you or make someone stay. If you develop self-esteem, spiritual discernment, and "a life," you won't find yourself making someone else responsible for your happiness or responsible for your pain. Manipulation, control, jealousy, neediness, and selfishness are not the ingredients of a thriving, healthy, loving and lasting relationship. Seeking status, sex, wealth and security are the wrong reasons to be in a relationship. What keeps a relationship strong? : Communication Intimacy Trust A sense of humor Sharing household tasks Some getaway time without business or children Daily exchanges (a meal, shared activity, a hug, a call, a touch, a note) Leave a nice message on their voicemail or send a nice email. Sharing common goals and interests. Growth is important. GROW TOGETHER, NOT AWAY FROM EACH OTHER, giving each other space to grow without feeling insecure. Allow your mate to have outside interests. You can't always be together. Give each other a sense of belonging and assurances of commitment. Don't try to control one another. Learn to accept each others families regardless of the situation. Respect his or her parents regardless. Don't put pressure on each other for material goods. Remember, for Richer or for Poorer. If these qualities are missing, the relationship will erode as resentment, withdrawal, abuse, neglect, dishonesty, and pain replace the passion "Be as innocent as the dove but as wise as the serpent." "Share what you know, learn what you don't   "       My Dream... I watch you from afar but it's just a dream because to you i don't mean a thing in search of a soul mate i bide my time ,But you're always there in the back of my mind .I want to get closer to you but you're out of my reach ,A warning tells me you are out of my league ,So i'll watch you from a distance. And you'll just be a dream , because to you i'll never mean a thing .... Don't Don't talk to me, i don't want to hear it. Don't touch me,i don't wanna feel it Don't come by, i don't wanna see you Don't question me,i won't give you a answer Don't invite me,cause i won't come Don't call me,i won't pick up the phone Don't come here,i will walk away Don't cook me dinner,i aint hungry Don't put an ad in the paper,i will not respond Don't ask me a favour Don't say my name Don't talk to my friends  Cause if you do any of this i might just have to give into you...........    Why??? Why do we say something so mean to each other? Is it because we like to or is it something else? Why do we do somthing bad and deny it straight after? Is it our choice or are we afraid of laughter? Why do we say something that isn't really true? Maybe we're ashamed or we want something new? Why do we laugh at people and act like it's no big deal? Why can't people be nice and think how the person might feel ? Why can't the world just stop fighting and get along ?No war ,no fighting ,just admit they are wrong.             09/07/2004 what the hell is going on ???? Iam in a world full of love and hate,pain and suffering all around me why do we cause pain and hurt to each other ...What is the pleasure we get from it???  Harsh Death As i point this sharp knife towards my wrist the pain that flows through my mind wishing that it will end .It seems so easy i think to myself ....But it aint will i go to hell for this sin iam about to cause??? iam a coward for thinking this i cut myself deeply red liquid slowly drips out and onto the white tiles in front of me i catch a glimpse of myself in my mirror my makeup runs as my soul comes out through my tears ....I smash the mirror with my bloody wrist FUCK THIS LIFE i say. I wish i could end mine but surely it would not be right ...........

                  DARKNESS              I feel like iam stuck in a maze of unhappiness since febuary this year my life has changed big time I have happiness like I used to iam usually a bubbly chik friendly to everyone but now i don't talk to anyone new I don't open up I just sit away from the rest of the world writing my thoughts in my little journal I mean all the time in class mostly I may act happy on the outside the only reason I do this is so noone will hassel me like are you ok ??? I think iam hiding myself well I was hurt many times already this year Brad fucked me over so many times ,my friend died that was the first death I have gone through ,Mark hurt me I was falling for him big time he abused me for no reason leaving me lost and feeling like a failure, My sister is going through anxiety like I did but the difference is that she has friends there for her and mum and dad care more about her than they did when I was sick my friends didn't wanna know me after I told em what was wrong why I don't go to school anymore I felt like a freak already but they made it worse , My ex best friend got pregnant her asshole boyfriend she is still with said if you don't give it up I will leave you she had an abortion I went with her yeah good ole me sat in the room looing at poters of still born babies around me I don't believe in this shit abortions why termanate a life if I was her I would of kept it or gave it away after it was born that's a better way ..... Tafe I am stressed about what to do with my carrer childcare cause I left school I have to do year ten now untill iam 17 -18 ok then I have to do a year of studying straight after I finish my current studies stressfull or what??? Finance I dont get much money but I am trying to save for a car $100 a fortnight put away then birthdays I have 7 coming within a month and my other personal items smokes argh enough said .... Problems with friends is it wrong to stress about my friend she is having major probs at the moment at home,uni,and her car she is getting kicked out of home soon :( so i offered a place her with me but I am the type of person that worries about everyone else before me I can't help it..... My weight ok I am trying to be true to myself and everyone around me I feel worthless at this weight I don't eat honestley last time i ate was 2 weeks ago in the society we live in today it's all about appereance the only way to get a boyfriend is to be skinny and pretty good luck to me trying to be that .... I was hurt before so I am closing my self of from the males most of them want sex and to cheat on chiks any way  guy's feel free to post any comment bye                Voices..  Voices going through my head telling me i should be dead this is what  they said i know you can't put up with this so put the knife to your wrist don't cry don't shout just just let all the blood spill out don't run and hide you know you want it they all do to just kill yourself please do so l can go home sit alone hold the blade to your wrist please go through with it ....             my favorite songs ... i know guy's i have weird taste in music       linkin park :One step closer linkin park:in the end linkin park:papercut linkin park:points of authority linkin park: crawling linkin park:a place for my head linkin park:forgotten linkin park :it's going down linkin park:numb linkin park:from the inside nate dogg:music and me Jadakiss and sheek:j-a-d-a joe/50 cent: ride wit you next:wifie fatman scoop:be faithful jay-z:give it to me ruff endz:no more scribe:not many scribe:my lady scribe:stand up fabulous:trade it all fabulous:cant let u go bone thugs n harmony:change the world bone thugs n harmony:crossroads genuine :w crush genuine:keep it real blaque:im good Shawn desman:sexy    dj's Victor lopez dj jemini smith kost marky mark myth scribble carrasco dark angel snipe moto vinny fluke mixes artel maydonoz clue abdel scratch m          Why is it so hard to tell someone the truth??????  People never really say what they mean. Why? When your being truthful and telling someone they look okay in those pants, why not just tell them they look fat.. if they really do? I mean your lieing to them, dont be afraid to be brutally honest. CAN U BRING URSELF TO TELL UR BEST FRIEND THAT HER NEW BOY FRIEND IS CHEATING ON HER????? SO WHAT IF SHES IN LOVE SO SHES SAYS BUT THE TRUTH U CANT SEEM TO BRING URSELF TO TELL HER RIGHT?IT RUNS THOUGH UR HEAD ABOUT TEN MILLION TIMES UNTILL U REALLY NEED TELL HER BUT U CANT WHAT TO DO NOW? U GO CRAZY WITH THE THOUGHT OF IT ,ITS TO MUCH PRESSURE TOO KEEP BUT U DONT WANNA BREAK HER HEART ................ SO WHAT DO U DO U CAN LIVE WITH IT ALL THE PRESSURE OF HAVING IT BUILD UP INSIDE AND SEE HER LATER ON STILL WITH HIM ???? GO TELL HER AND RISK RUINING UR FRIENDSHIP AND U MIGHTNEVER SPEAK TO HER AGIAN MAKE UR CHOICE UP QUICKLEY BEFORE IT'S TO LATE...

          my life 8th febuary 2004 my first day at tafe . i was having a good day at tafe i saw nick in the morning i have known nick for about 2 years now i look after his daughter at my childcare centre i work at . i saw him i spoke to him for a while i remember he was teasing me because i love guy sebastian lol he's so cute then i was walking back to class with coojoe and i got a message on my mobile it was from wanessa i read it said "bek dion was in a car accident on sunday " dion is one of my friends that i meet through carl a local bum that hangs around whalan lol he's kool i did'nt conect in my brain that dion was dead untill that nite wen i was in the bath i broke down and cryed i was thinking to myself this is not true i just saw him on wednesday i found out he died on tuesday then my sister came home she came into the bathroom crying she told me all about his death ..... and we were going to go to his open coffen viewing on wednesday night i was scared cause i have never been to one before... The next day i went to tafe and i told nick all about it dion was one of his closet friends before he moved away from whalan he didn't believe it he was so angry he wanted to kill those guy 's who left dion there in the car . we organized to meet nick at dion's mum's house that night me my sister and my friend walked in with dion's older sister we sat down next to dion my sister sat next to his face i was next to his stomach and my friend was near his feet ..... He looked so peaceful like he was sleeping i kept thinking about all the funny things he did when we saw him like telling an old guy to give him a head job , jumping over peoples fences and that spastic dance he did the last time we saw him he dared me to chuck a brown eye at the cars's going past (he lived on a main road) and doing the reversing noise at the same time beep beep beep lol i was'nt gonna do it no way i refused i remember him teasing my friends snoop dogg shoes cause they were 30 bucks to buy at the local shops she paid 55 for them did'nt he tease her........ I never realised how much of a good friend he was untill he was gone iam not saying i was'nt close to him or anything he was so gorgeous just laying there with his eyes closed his hands felt so real i know they were real he was a human but like they were a bit cold but with a warmish touch to them his hair was so beatiful it was so soft lol..... his favorite song was playing music and me by nate dogg it was playing softley in the backround aroud us on the walls were baby photos of him wat a cute little boy he wasi said my goodbyes to dion and i headed off home i was still in shock from the whole thing my mind kept running why dion wat did he deserve to die? i was so confused and angry i was in the kitchen making myself a drink i could'nt help it anymore i screamed all the pressure of the death bottled up inside i had to get out off tha house but i stayed in side in stead i was'nt gonna make myself feel greedy by running away no way i had to stay there i had to comfort my sister ......the next day was the funeral i could'nt go my boss would'nt let me my sis and my friend did they put a rose down for me and the family let of baloons for dion i wish i went .....so there's the story that has been in my mind ever since dion died the 8 th of febuary 2004 he was 18 years old he was to young i know i can't bring him back i wish i could but i can't it's just a shame that we have all lost a beautiful young man he had so much going for him iam not gonna say anymore about him otherwise i will be dweling R.I.P dion i will see u later buddy look after ur son love bekky...   You are !!!!!You are my love you are my soul you are the one that i adore, you are racing in my mind, you are in my dreams ,you are the light i wish to seek ,you are the morning glow that always see,you are the stars i love to watch , you are the one i want to love , you are my life ,you are my boy.....  Be you!!When things get really tough and tears start to fly you will work things out if you hold your head up high just ask for some help when your feeling sad cause there are people out there to get you through find someone you trust in who you can confinde let all your emotions go keep nothing bottled up inside.Don't think your not good enough for anyone else everybody's unique just believe in yourself take my advice and do anything you can do to be that beautiful girl you know as you  Desire .........Absence makes the heart grow fonder they say while i sit here and ponder the lonleness i feel inside my body aches with desire my heart fills with emptiness because your not around your touch and presence are just an image.In my mind to hold and to cherish and i forever love you......   Sunday, May 02, 2004 WHY IS IT SO HARD BEING A TEENAGER?????All the pressure and stuff to be so called normal to be skinny like a model to be gorgeous for guys peer preesure with drugs and drinking and to have sex when your not ready exam stresses being teased feeling lonely when u don't have a boyfriend constantly trying to fit in at skool to feel accepted by other people changing the way u look hair dying etc whats the use we have teenagers with depression witch i have suffered from from 2 years. panic attacks,bulimia,anorexia, cutting urself makes u feel better see all of the shit we try to do to feel wanted and accepted no wonder why people go crazy all the damn pressure and parents don't help do well at skool blah blah blah groups at skool it seems like u have to belong to a "popular one" u have the girls that think there all it walking around all done up like there going to the ball the kool good looking boys enough said the nerds get picked on cause there smart so wat why are we changing ourselves for other people when i was at skool i was teased yes and bullied cause i was chubby so wat why do we all want to look the same will being skinny or built up make us happy??? music to gothic people have there slipknot and that teeny boppers have there britney spears rnb have snoop dogg and all that i get picked on a bit cause i like guy sebastian so wat i like him if u dont like it tuff u can deal with it cause i aint gonna change my music style for noone sorry   Good Morning Everyone It's 2:30am here in Sydney Australia and i can't sleep i have some shit on my mind i can't seem to shift away these feelings and thoughts that i have been having latley iam having issues at home about a family member is sick and its worrying me sick that the doctors don't know what's wrong and what's causing her sickness.....The second thing is school (well tafe) i have been having major issues with my study problems i can't concirtrate it's really annoying me i just cant seem too put my mind in some kind of state so i can work .... it's so damn hard ...The third problem is guys guys guys like every girl i want a boyfriend but i feel like i aint ready for one but in some sort of weird way i feel ready i need to find comfort in myself which will take me a long time i need to accept myself for who iam not what i look like.Also i feel lonely without someone with me i see other girls my age prettier than me with boys i feel sad and hopeless like iam useless and i will never be truly loved....Every girl dreams of a wedding right?not me i used to want a loving husband and 2 kids one boy one girl live a nice house have a good job POOF as soon as i ventured into my early teens it all changed for me i didn't want to get married cause i feel unwanted and fat the emotional pain i went though to try to fit in constantly checking urself "Is my make up ok?"

I miss crying in the corner   of my cold bedroom wanting to die. I miss your yelling and   screaming. I miss how you'ld tell me to kill myself and how you'ld be   happy. I miss knowing how I'd hate the next place I'd be at. I miss   the cold nights spent crying under the deck. I miss you freaking out   about every little thing. But most of all I miss my old life, as I knew I would.     Kiss me and tell me it's not broken.Kiss me and kiss me till I'm   dead.See, I'll give you the stars from the bruised ev 'nin' skyAnd a   crown of jewels for your head, now,For your head, now, for your   head, now, for your headOne last night in bed for a time,And two   more wishes. and both are for thine.And three guesses you’re the   angel's child,And four hopes this love's not spoiled     it's a picture-perfect eveningand i'm staring down the sunfully  loaded, deaf and dumb and donewaiting for sedation to disconnect   my heador any situation where i'm better off than dead    Heaven bent to take my handNowhere left to turnI'm lost to those I   thought were friendsTo everyone I knowOh they turned their heads   embarassedPretend that they don't seeBut it's one missed step You'll   slip before you know itI've fallen*       It's not easy to hide All this damage inside And I'll carry it with me Till I'm not alive ♥   On the day that you were born The angels got together and decided   To create a dream come true So they sprinkled moondust in your hair Of gold and starlight in your bye eyesesn't Feel Right    Together It Doesn't Feel Right At AllTogether, Together We've Built A WallTogether Holding Hands We'll Fall    "And when your back's against the wallJust turn around and you will seei will catch, i will catch your fallJust have a little faith, faith in me"    And if you don’t believeThe sun will riseStand alone and greet The coming night   I still remember a year agoThe times we spent I think that I'm   happier nowUp from the down By all meansIt's strange cause I feel the same way. ^*^ * ^
