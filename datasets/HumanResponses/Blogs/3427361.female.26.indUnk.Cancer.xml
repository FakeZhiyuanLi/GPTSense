        coffee. and we're waiting for them to deliver our new mattress set. i can't wait. yay! new furniture. it stormed last night again. lots and lots of big storms and some tornadoes and bright lightning and low deep rumbling thunder that rumbled on and on and on. it was such a strange afternoon. it was such a strange night. but we did get a lot done while we were down there on tornado watch. loran painted a bookshelf. i cleaned some. we decided to get rid of our couch down there and tear the floor up and we're gonna put new tile down and i love doing stuff like that. cleaning and fixing up. when the time is right, i love it.  i dreamt of a grocerystore last night. i dream about that a lot. going shopping at the market. walking up and down aisles. but it doesn't look like a normal grocerystore. and i'm always there w/a lot of people. and i never actually get through the checkout line. i always end up doing a lot of other things.   last night we sat in the garage while it poured rain outside. drank high life out of the can. i had on my slip and cardigan and pink rain boots and there were big puddles to walk in.

      i do love me some  urlLink carmizzle . & she's made her blog into a place where she can put her writing snippets. and since i don't have anything to post tonight, i thought i'd post some snippets of my own. and so.  ***this is from a piece i've had sitting around for awhile. i don't know where it's going and i don't know where it's been, but. so.       He reminds me of bus stations. And the only time I’ve actually ever spent time in bus stations were those dark cold nights when I’d ride with my dad to pick up my grandma.  And he’d give me a quarter to watch one of the little black and white teevees bolted to the chairs. I’d watch The Cosby Show or The Andy Griffith Show until the screen would pop and shrink and disappear. And by then, my grandma would be standing there, a slight smile on her face and a small hard navy blue suitcase in her hands.  The cold would be sitting on her collar, her short curled grey hair, smelling of Detroit.  And we’d ride into the west end of town, dropping her off at the sidewalk of her small white clapboard house.  I’d say goodbye to her and she’d always lean down and say goodbye back. But she wouldn’t look at me.  She rarely looked at me.  ***       He reminded me of bright red rainboots. The driving rain.  The Rolling Stones.  The best burrito I’ve ever had.  Staying up late and mimosas and lady jazz singers and cigarettes and Christmas eve and holding hands and the squeak of a guitar.  Big around the neck hugs when someone steps off the bus.  Someone you’ve waited your whole life to kiss.  Someone who will tear their hair out when you die.

      "ease your feet into the sea" by belle & sebastian is such a nice song. it's so calm and perfect. hammocks and water w/lemon wedges and bare feet and swimming and kissing.  i was gonna take some digipics but my camera is out of batteries. and i don't know where the others are. boo.  i was just gonna show you my new gap pants. b/c i love to shop. and i'm always stoked when i find something cool. they're sorta pinkish and capri and lovely.  one of my favorite outfits of all time is a tank top and panties. i'm telling you, i'd wear it out if i could. like to target and the coffeeshop and you name it. (even though i'm sure i'd slip on my jeans for church and all.)

      so strange having a blog. heh. but blogger sure has jazzed itself up, hasn't it? i do say so. hm. i always used to have an lj and a blog. so. since i don't have lovelylight anymore. i'll swing off of blogspot for awhile. why not.  and i guess i won't really be putting any sort of different stuff here than i do at my lj, but still. it's always fun making new online stuff. i do miss lovelylight. but it was time to let it go. it just was. and so i did. but who knows. i may own a domain again one day. or not. i never know stuff like that until it happens to me.  i think i'm addicted to mouthwash. the tingling. i love it.  i need to drink more water.

               On the way home, I was thinking of calling Nan to see if she wanted to get coffee or something,  but Ruby was sitting in front of my house.  She was on my stoop drinking a cherry slush. She smiled at me. Her mouth was stained bright red. 	“What are you doing here, Ruby?”	 	“Oh, hush.  You’re glad I’m here.  I’m coming up,” she said. 	“And what if I said no?” 	“You wouldn’t.” 	“What if I did?” 	She ignored me and stood up. We went inside. She saw Nan’s number on my arm. 	“So are you gonna call her?  Nan?” she said, sitting cross legged on my couch. She was wearing a slip under a little red raincoat. She tossed the coat on the floor. 	“Yes.   She likes me,” I said. 	“And what’s that mean? Because you know I like you.  I like you more than I’ve ever liked anything,” she said.  She looked like she was going to cry. Again. 	“And I don’t believe you,” I said. And I didn’t. 	“Well, can I stay here?” 	“What’s the point, Ruby?” I put my hands in my hair and didn’t look at her.  I just didn’t want to look at her.  I mean, I did, but I couldn’t. She was tearing my heart out. 	“There is no point, Brody.  Can’t friends spend the night together?  My toothbrush is here.” 	“Friends don’t have sex.” 	“So we won’t.” 	“Alright,” I said.  I went to the bathroom and washed my face.  When I came out, I went into my pocket for a cigarette.  I was going to go outside to smoke it, but looked into my bedroom and saw Ruby asleep on my bed, hugging my pillow. I took off my clothes and got next to her in bed.  She put her arms around me.          The driving rain against the windows woke me up.  I got out of bed and opened the window.  It was still the middle of the night.  I smoked my bedside table cigarette.  When I was halfway done, Ruby woke up and asked for some of it.  I handed it to her without looking over. 	“I would be so totally jealous if you hooked up with Nan again,” she said in her sleepiest voice.  The rain was coming down harder now.  I was loving it. 	“Why?”  	“Because you loved her,” she said. 	“No, I didn’t,” was all I said.

      He drove first. I had my bare feet on the dashboard and the radio was loud. We hadn’t talked for an hour or so, just listened to music and smoked and shared a warm Dr. Pepper. I was used to every thing about him. I was used to being with him all the time. (Incredibly used to the heat from his hand-hot on my thigh, his breath on my face, his worn-in sneakers and old Levi’s and how his kisses tasted in my mouth.)  I looked out the window at the flatness of Missouri whirring by, the brown green of its grass and the brighter green of the highway signs.	   We stopped at the Tulsa Holiday Inn for the night. The next morning we got sausage biscuits and coffee before getting back on the road, heading for his ungodly huge house hanging on the desert cliffs of Santa Fe.

      i remember when the snow fell in the streetlamp light and the coffeeshop door had a bell that jingled when people came and went. i remember that flannel shirt i used to wear every day and how you kissed me on the steps and i didn't close my eyes. i watched the snow.

      ...We didn't fight a lot, really. But when we did, people would threaten to call the cops. What I needed was for him to be more. More what? he'd ask. And then I'd get pissed. "Just more, you motherfucker!" I said one time drunk on whiskey. We were in his front yard. I kicked my shoes off and took aim. My sneakers thumped against his car door and plopped onto the grass. "Crazy bitch," was all he said before walking in the house. The screen door slammed once and twice and then softly smacked_getting quieter and quieter and stopped....

      ...I was always doing that - saying the same word twice to emphasize its importance. For example, saying that I have a crush on him is one thing.  That would be harmless.  But no, I have a crush-crush on him.  That’s  not  harmless. That consists of me mentally picturing what it would be like to be beneath him with my back arched, my mouth on his neck, him panting in my ear. Crush-crush. I was beginning to wonder how we were going to get home, since we were both gladly slouching toward drunkenness...

            ...His bedroom was steamy hot. His thin t-shirt was too big on me and it was sticking to the tops of my thighs. The windows were open, but there was no breeze and one of those loud, buzzy junebugs kept flying at the screen again and again and again. I thought of getting up to turn the air conditioning on, but I was too tired. I wanted to smoke. I wanted to cry. I wanted to sleep. 	Carter was on his back, snoring. He had a perfect twenty-five year old body. His hips were bony and those bones slid down into the sides of his underwear like smooth arrows. I took my finger and touched the skin underneath his bellybutton. He flinched a little but didn’t wake up.  I did it again. I kissed him on the mouth. He kissed me back in his sleep.  I rolled over. I wanted to be there. I really wanted to be there...

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin drove a little beige convertible.&nbsp; It was so cute and he looked great driving it.&nbsp; The wind whipping his hair across his forehead, his long fingers wrapped around the long black stickshift...I felt so lucky to be the only other person in the car with him.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “My mom’s really sick,” he said while we were waiting at a red light.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What’s wrong with her?”&nbsp; I asked gently.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Cancer.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m so sorry.”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “She loves the zoo,” he said, shifting and pressing down on the gas.&nbsp; We were almost there.&nbsp; The sun was&nbsp;too bright.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ate first.&nbsp; Over where the peacocks walk around like they own the place, their shiny green and blue feathers twitching in the spring wind.&nbsp; Colin popped open a can of pop and started talking about his mom again.&nbsp; He told me her name was Bee.&nbsp; She used to be a fashion model, and then she got pregnant with him and married his dad.&nbsp; She was in the hospital now.&nbsp; His dad sits with her and reads, even though they’re not sure if she can hear him or not.&nbsp; Colin goes to see her every other day.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I don’t go every day.&nbsp; I can’t go every motherfucking day,” &nbsp;he said, wiping his eyes quickly.&nbsp; I gasped when I noticed he was crying.&nbsp;&nbsp; It made me cry too.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You’re right,” I said, laying my hand, palm up on the picnic table .&nbsp; He put his hand softly in mine and used his t-shirt to quickly wipe his eyes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, when we were on our tiptoes staring down at the sea otters, he told me that I was the first person he’d told about his mom.&nbsp; I asked him why and he said he didn’t know.&nbsp; We held hands and walked through the rest of the zoo.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were back in his car now.&nbsp; He looked over at me and asked if I wanted to go to the hospital with him and I couldn’t say no.&nbsp; No way in hell.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospitals are always terrible, but it is a bit easier when the person hooked up to the machine is someone you‘ve never even met.&nbsp; It‘s less suffocating.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Mom?”&nbsp; Colin whispered as we walked over.&nbsp; Her eyes were closed and she was perfectly still except for her stomach slowly rising and falling with each breath.&nbsp; Somehow, she looked beautiful.&nbsp; Her hair was short and fuzzy and her hands were so small.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Mom, this is my pretty friend, Simone.&nbsp; She wants to go to Paris.&nbsp; I forgot to tell her that you used to live there,” Colin continued, sitting in a green leather chair next to the hospital bed.&nbsp; I stood next to him with my arms crossed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin got really quiet and sat back in the chair.&nbsp; After a moment, I took one of&nbsp; Bee’s hands and held it.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Colin took me to the zoo today.&nbsp; The peacocks were so excited to see us having lunch with them. You have the prettiest smallest hands. Nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands,” &nbsp;I was whispering now.&nbsp; Colin was leaning forward so he could hear me better.&nbsp; Bee barely squeezed and Colin beamed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “She does that sometimes,” he said to me, “Mom, can you hear me?&nbsp; Squeeze my hand,” he said, taking her hand from me.&nbsp; She squeezed it and Colin leaned up to kiss her pale cheek.

      We went for a walk and she held my hand a lot.  And that’s when I told her. 	“Ruby.” 	She looked at me and blinked. Her eyelashes were long and shiny and her messy black hair was in her face.  She pulled some of it behind her ear.  She put her hands in my pockets and standing there, she leaned her head against my chest. 	“I love you,” I said softly, “and I can’t let you treat me like this.” 	“Yes.  You can,” she said, never looking up at me.  And after a moment of quiet, she stepped back and walked away.  And without even thinking, I was following her again. 	And then I stopped.  I stood there and watched her walk away and she walked and walked and then she turned around.  I was in darkness and she was under the flickering streetlamp. 	“I can’t change. You have to be okay with how I am.  I’m okay with how you are.  And maybe I’m wrong.  Maybe we can be together,” she said. 	I just stood there at first.  My heart was beating so fast. So fast I didn’t know how long I could stand still.   	“Fuck you!” I hollered, before walking off in the opposite direction.  I didn’t take her home.
