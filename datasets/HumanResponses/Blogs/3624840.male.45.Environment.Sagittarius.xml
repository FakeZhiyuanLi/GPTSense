      Okay so I got over my recent enthusiasm for blogs and wondered just what I was doing? I look at other blogs and see people who often talk about how much they love to write and I wonder if I really want to go ahead with this blog - I DO NOT LIKE WRITING!  I sometimes think I must have been born with the wrong mother tongue - maybe I would have found writing much easier if I had been born in China or Germany.  I find it so hard to put the words together, and put those words into complete concise sentences.  Some people seem to have a real gift for writing and it just flows out of their brain through their fingertips onto paper.  Maybe its because I muddle through things and don't feel like I can think clearly and concisely a lot of the time.  I've often imagined my brain is like a bowl of porridge and it takes a lot of effort to dig into that sticky mess and find the right words to link together into sentences.  It could also be that my thought processes do not follow the rules of good grammar and so I find it hard to convert them into complete sentences.  Did I always hate to write?  I don't think so.  I think it arose when I went to university and became a biologist.  Being trained to write as a scientist has got to be one of the best ways to kill any creative writing endeavours.  You are told to write clearly and concisely which is fine (although they never showed you what they meant by being "clear and concise") but you are also forced to be objective which usually includes: writing in the third person                   writing in a passive voice                   just provide the facts and avoid any hint of partisanship  I became very good at scientific writing and obtained good marks on any papers I had to write even though I found the whole process to be unnatural and very stressful. Have you ever read a scientific paper??  Most of them will put you to sleep in no time.  But after all is said and done, I think I'll carry on.  At least putting my thoughts to keyboard does provide some therapuetic value.

      So after having gone through all of the steps to create a blog, I thought "Wow, this is so simple! - it's way easier than the time I tried to learn how to create a web page."  After admiring my first blog entry and the wonderful style and colours of my blog page (I think the template was called "Rounders 3") I noticed the only thing it said under my personal profile was my login name.  And I thought to myself "Well that doesn't say very much."  So I then started flipping between the different help screens and editing pages in blogger to figure out how to edit my profile.  It looked so simple - in the help file it said go to the dashboard and click on the "Edit Profile" button.  So of course I go to the dashboard and look for the "Edit Profile" button.  I can't see it! Where could they have hidden it?  Why didn't they show in the help file, exactly where this button is?  Maybe it's somewhere else and I'm really not on the correct page to edit my profile.   So I spent the next couple of hours flipping from page to page, clicking on a variety of links trying to find my "Edit Profile" button without any success.  So I gave up and though let's try it again later.    Next day - turn on the computer, sign on to the blog site, and, after copious cups of coffee to achieve an alertness I hadn't had the night before, I start hunting for the elusive "Edit Profile" button.  Again, I spend another hour or so without success.  So finally, I thought "Let's just fire off an email to the blog site and see what stupid thing I've been doing or not doing that will not allow me to edit my profile"  A few hours later I checked my email to find the following message from the blog site:    "Hi there,  We've had to temporarily disable profile-editing while we troubleshoot some performance issues with our servers. This should be back online very soon. Thanks for your patience, Blogger Support"   This was followed about 15 minutes later by the next email:    "Hi there,  We wanted to let you know that we've received your support request. We make every effort to respond quickly to all our users problems and questions. While you're waiting for us to respond, please check Blogger Help - http://help.blogger.com/ - many common questions are answered there. *** Notice *** As of 2004/06/12, Profile editing (as well as password recovery & changing) has been temporarily disabled as we troubleshoot some unresponsive servers. Blogger Status has further details: http://status.blogger.com/ Thanks for your patience, Blogger Support"   So, after all that, it wasn't my stupidity that was holding me back (It's also three days later and they still haven't enabled the "edit profile" button).    I have to remind myself less and less frequently as the years go by that it isn't always me that's the problem.  In the past, I use to think if I was reading a computer manual or listening to a lecture at university that if I couldn't understand something, it must be because I'm stupid.  But you know, 99% of the time - that turns out to be crap. I'm not the problem, it was the inability of the author or university prof to explain the issue in a clear, concise and unambiguous manner.  When I was a grad student, I worked as a lab instructor in a number of undergrad biology courses to help make ends meet.  One of my tasks was to write and mark lab quizzes and exams.  It became really obvious that the ability of a student to get a good mark depended in part on how carefully the quizz or exam questions were worded.  If there was any degree of ambiguity in the exam question, I often had to give those students who got it wrong the benefit of the doubt because they misunderstood the question because it was too vaguely worded.    How I wish I knew this when I was an undergraduate student.  I would have challenged the profs on a lot of those poorly-worded and vague exam questions - I always thought I just wasn't smart enough.

      So this is the very first posting.  I have very little idea of what I'm doing given that I'm not a computer junkie although I use computer almost every day for work.  I only became vaguely aware of blogs and blogging over the last year from reading Doonsbury comic strips about Howard Dean and his run for the presidency.  Then last week I happen to be watching the news on tv (Global)and heard the newscaster,????? (its wierd - I've been watching this guy deliver the news for over a year on tv almost every day and now I can't even think of his name!!  - either a sign of senility or just a brain fart)----say you can check out his daily blog on the web.  So I did - it was midly interesting - and thought there must be other blogs out there.  So after using google to do a search for blogs, I ended up spending three or four hours just surfing the net looking at blogs and blog-realted sites.  Wow! The web has become a lot more interesting than it use to be!  I've never been much of an internet surfer - I've looked at lots of web pages but because they change so rarely, once you've seen a given web page - that's it.  But blogs are so much more fascinating - there's an immediacy to seeing what others have been thinking about over the past day or two - and being able to leave comments is just great!  I do not easily get excited about things but this whole blog thing that I've been exploring over the past week has been really invigorating. I've seen great blogs and have thought this is something I want to try!    So what kind of blog do I want?  There is such a huge range out there both in content and structure.  Do I want to bare my soul? be entertaining? be controversal? be pretentious? -be someone else?   I DONT KNOW   I'm just going to let this thing: evolve? die a miserable death? and see what happens.    Why I came up with the blog name, treefodder, is beyond me - but, hey, it demanded I call this blog something and the fact that its too early in the day for me to think clearly - well thats the best I can do (I hope I have the option of changing the name but I suspect I'll just have to create a new site).  Now I remember!!! - His name is Kevin Newman

      Here I am bored out of my mind trying to create a stunning graphic in Illustrator CS when my knowledge of the program is pretty scanty.  I am flipping between blogs, playing Zuma (a fairly addictive game you can download off of the internet) and Illustrator.  I am definitely in a funk.  I have tried to read two books and just couldn't get into them.  The last book I managed to read was "Under the Skin" by Michel Faber.  This was one of those really wierd books like "Perfume" and "The Calcutta Chromosome" that stays with you for a long time.  Essentially it is a story about a woman in Scotland who daily drives the highways looking for big beefy male hitchhikers to pickup.  Why? You'll have to read the book to find out but it is definitely not what you would normally expect and actually turns out to be a very thought-provoking story.  I love reading for the most part - it is a great form of escapism and relaxation during the summer. Lately, I've been reading a lot of science fiction which is pretty unusual as I gave up reading that stuff in my early twenties when I got bored with the lack of character development that typified so much of the stuff out there and I just couldn't face reading another story about dragons (Anne McAffery).  Anyways, over the past couple of years I have started to read more and more science fiction.  The characters seem to be more developed with interesting storylines.  I've really enjoyed some of the stuff by Richard Morgan - his first novel, "Altered Carbon" reminded me very much of the movie "Blade Runner" and the idea that the "soul" or "person" could be digitally stored and simply downloaded into a human body was pretty fascinating.  Anyways its time to get back to Illustrator CS and try and make some pretty pictures.

      It has been so warm on the coast for the last month.  Typically, June is kinda wet and cool with temperatures in the low twenties.  But this summer it has been usually in the mid- to high-twenties and sunny every single day except on July 2nd where it finally rained.  I hate hot temperatures!  I like those nice balmy temperatures in the low twenties where there is a nice breeze from the ocean to keep things cool.  It's ironic (or just bad luck) that I spend about half of my time in Kamloops which is the hottest city in the country.  I spent much of last summer in Kamloops and the daily temperature stayed in the high thirties for several weeks during the worst of the forest fires.  I would stay at work in the air-conditioned office until about 8 p.m. just so I didn't have to go outside or go home to a stifling, warm apartment.  I've been reading billbored's blog who lives in Ontario who has been complaining about the cool, wet weather - I think I would trade him a few of his wet days for some of our hot sunny days.  At least with cool weather you can bundle up but there is not much you can do when its scorching hot.
