      OKEY DOCKEY! Today I would like to talk about another group that I really enjoy listening to:  urlLink The Beatles .  My favourite album is  The Blue Album :        You probably know most of their songs. My favourite is "All you need is love" because I just think it's true.  Enjoy!

      Yesterday night, Dylan and I had dinner with a friend, Adrian Murphy. Because of his last name, everyone calls him Spud. I met Spud 2 years ago when I first arrived in Australia and joined the  urlLink Adelaide Swords Club  where I fence. I met Spud through the Internet before I came to Australia and I thought at that time that he was a woman!! Yeap, "Adrian" sounds like a feminie name in France and I never thought that it could be different here!   Anyway, I was lucky to meet him because he is a great guy and I enjoy fencing with him as well as spending time doing everything and nothing. We help each other to teach fencing at the club. He is a very good fencer but also a physicist. Within his work he gets to travel everywhere in the world to help for the installation of radars. He is 39 years old yes, and the latest new is: he will be a daddy soon soon!  We are very happy for him, don't know yet if it is a girl or a boy, but he/she should come into the world in November!! Pictures will then be available!!

      Hey hey hey!!  How was your week end? Spent it in bed, plying sport, walking in the bush...Mmm, Dylan and I spent our Sunday with some friends in the South of Adelaide. We left the city at 11am to drive to Mount Compass, 45 min drive to stop at a little cafe where you can eat venison pie and other gourmet. 99% fat free, like kangaroos, and it is absolutely delicious!! Then, we drove a few km down south and we stop at a fishing farm. Everyone tried to fish trouts, big competition. Some people used hand line, others the usual stick (I don't remember how it is called in English!). Well, the results of the competition were as follows: Dylan caught 2 the biggest ones (2kg) - 1 with the hand line and the other with the stick Adeline caught 2 (1,9kg) (rrrr..!!) - all with the hand line Bruce caught 1 (500g)with the stick  Well, as you can see from the results, I AM THE ACTUAL WINNER OF THE COMPETITION! NA!!  Just jocking, in fact Dylan did really well, Bruce as well, and we wouldn't have caught them without the others! We came back home and stopped at Hamilton Wineries on the way to buy a couple of bottles. We ended the day with a delicious dinner at Bruce's place, we ate Fish & Chips (as you could imagine!), home recipe. We enjoyed our day very much and we look forward to go again!!

      I am reading a fantastic book at  the moment that Dylan advised me to put my eyes on:   The Stand  by Stephen King  I am not a big fan of King and I think I have only read  It  . Dylan told me that this book is the best of the author's collection and I thought I would give it a go. It is a 2000 pages book, so I'm not looking forward to finish it tomorrow but I enjoy it, especially before going to bed. It helps me to fall asleep.   If you haven't a book to read and you are looking for one, try  The Stand , you will enjoy it!  Thank you Dylan!  Ho, and if you want to check what the story is about go to the following website:  urlLink http://www.stephenking.com/pages/works/stand/  And there are much more works from Stephen King...

      Haaa now we can enjoy our new couch at home. We got the mattress yesterday and it is very comfortable than you very much!! The cushions fit perfectly with the cover of the mattress and the colour of the base of the bed. We can now watch the West Coast Eagles kick some Dockers' bums in a more comfortable position!! (hi hi!) Well, if you want to come at our place for a visit, you can enjoy a great couch, and if you want to stay at home for the night, pas de probleme our new bed will help you to rest!!

      Well well well! The end of the week has come, please welcome Mr week end!  Our plans are for Saturday and Sunday are as follows: Saturday - Adeline will spend her day at the Recreation and Sport Centre to pass her Level 1 Coaching - hopefully, she'll get it! Adeline's prince will probably relax and enjoy a day without his silly & smelly girlfriend! (hi hi hi!!) Sunday - Ha the BIG DAY! We are going with some friends up North from Adelaide to eat a Venison pie for lunch and to catch a trout in a farm. You pay for it before you catch it and then you cook it the way you like and enjoy it with your friends. Everyone will have one for dinner. I am quite excited to go because our friends are very nice, 100% South Australian and they enjoy telling stories about Australians.  Our friends are Bruce, Pam and their son Tom Dawson. I met Bruce at the fencing club, he is an epeist. He is a real champion and I enjoy fencing with him sometimes (even if he prefers the "crappy" weapon!) ;-)  Here are our plans for the week end, hope you'll enjoy yours...Tell me about it!

      Ok, Ok, I forgot to explain what is "the Block". It's a live TV show in Australia where 4 couples are trying to transform one apartment each to make it look nice. They have a certain budget to achieve this and they have to renovate a room per week. They can't live somewhere else during the show and they have to be outside the apartment between 9am and 4pm. At the end of the week, the room that brings the greatest value to the apartment wins some money to invest for the next room. The winner is the couple that brings the greatest value to the whole apartment. What is cool is that you learn some tips for renovqtion and the couples are quite funny except for one, they are real bastards!!  Anyway, you can check out the web site of the show, it's quite cool, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!!  http://theblock.ninemsn.com.au/theblock/default.asp  Enjoy!

      Hello hello!  Today is a special day! Dylan and I have decided to get a nice sofa for our living room as we don't have anywhere to properly seat when we watch TV. My mum bought us some bin bags but the problem is, when we invite some friends over, we have to tell them to bring their own chairs...Not very nice is it?  Well, because we wanted to be more social (ha ha!), we thought we would invest in a sofa. We found the base of a single bed for free and we are now deciding on the matress to put on. We found a second hand one, quite confortable and cheap, and we also found some cushions to go with it.  Total price = around 95 AUS dollars. Not bad hey! You probably need to see a picture of the "Unit 37 new sofa" so you'll be able to judge by yourself!  We will soon be able to seat properly to watch "the Block"!  To be continued...

      Alright let me introduce Audrey - she is my brother's fiancee, she is studying Medicine in Marseille (yes, she is quite smart thank you very much!) and she grew up in Nice, down South of France. Edouard and her met during their intern programs in Marseille and they are now engaged. She is a wonderful person and she is also very pretty, Edouard is a lucky guy!!  Anyway, I wanted to talk about Audrey  because it is her name's day today. So, as a French would say: "Bonne fete Audrey!".  Love to you and Edouard!

      Well, maud, my lovely sister, arrives soon from the country with smelly cheeses! We are looking forward for her to arrive as we have prepared a little surprise...well, I don't think I will tell you what it is but I can give you some clues: it is something that you eat, that is really australian and it has a bit of history - let me tell you...  During WWII, when the Australians were fighting away from home, the wife of the soldiers could only send this "Maud's surprise" to them because it could still be good after a very long trip...Now the Australians gave it a very famous name but I won't tell you what...  If you can't wait to find the answer, ask Bernadette, she should remember...

      Here we went!! Yesterday afternoon, Dylan and I went to see the movie "Shrek 2". it was really really good. My favourite character was the cat (with the voice of Antonio Banderas), he was so cute! Anyway, I advise you to go and see it because it is fantastic, you will laugh so much it's just great!  After the movie we went back home, prepared a nice dinner "en tete-a-tete" as the French may say, and watched some shows on TV before going back under the warm blanket...  Hope you will go and see "Shrek 2", the ogres, the donkey and the cat are really funny! Enjoy!

      I'm gonna start a serie of posts where I will talk about music, groups, artists, albums, etc.  My favourite group is  urlLink U2 , my favourite album would be Rattle & Hum and my favourite song...hum...maybe "I still haven't found what I'm looking for". Anyway, I love the Irish boys but I also enjoy listening to  urlLink the Beatles ,  urlLink the Rolling Stones ,  urlLink Jean-Jacques Goldman ,  urlLink Yann Tiersen  , and others.  I don't really like Rap and Heavy Metal but I enjoy listening to Classical music and all sorts of melody.  I let you go and have a look at the different web sites mentioned above, some of them are quite cool.  Today I will start with U2 by posting the lyrics of the song which introduced them to me: "One". Actually, the story behind it is quite nice. My brother Edouard spent a month or two in America, 14 years ago I think, where he went to play tennis at the Bollettieri Academy. Well, he came back home with doublsized muscles (good for him!!) and an album of U2: "Achtung Baby". He said that the song number 3 was great (which was absolutely true!) and here you go, I fell in love with the group. I bought all their albums, I am a fan and I would like to share some of their songs with you...    "One"   Is it getting better  Or do you feel the same Will it make it easier on you  Now you got someone to blame You say one love, one life  When it's one need in the night It's one love We get to share it It leaves you baby If you don't care for it  Did I disappoint you  Or leave a bad taste in your mouth You act like you never had love And you want me to go without Well it's too late tonight  To drag the past out into the light We're one but we're not the same We get to carry each other, carry each other One  Have you come here for forgiveness Have you come to raise the dead Have you come here to play Jesus  To the lepers in your head Did I ask too much More than a lot You gave me nothing Now it's all I got We're one but we're not the same We hurt each other, then we do it again  You say love is a temple Love a higher law Love is a temple Love the higher law You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl And I can't be holding on to what you got When all you got is hurt One love, one blood, one life You got to do what you should One life with each other Sisters, brothers One life but we're not the same We get to carry each other, carry each other One One   Enjoy...

      Hi everyone! Well well well, how was your week end?   Here, under the sun and clouds of South Australia, Saturday was very active and Sunday was calm.  Every saturday morning I sort of teach fencing to juniors for an hour. The kids are wonderful and we enjoy our time. I think they try hard to understand me, remember that my english is not perfect!! Ha ha!  Anyway, back to the subject. Saturday...Well, after talking swords and foils with the kids I went for a coffee with some friends before having lunch at home with my love. My day ended up working at my favourite restaurant where I usually do the dishies!! Finished worked @ 11pm, came back home, watched a bit of TV and went to bed under the warm quilt that Dylan was already stealing...rrr...rrr!  Sunday, ha...Sunday (my favourite day because there is nothing to do except staying in bed all morning long), got up early to go to referee a school team fencing competition at St John's College in a suburb called Belair, near where we live. The kids are cool and they tried so hard to make their team win it was quite fun. I Ccame back home in the afternoon, went for a walk with my prince and we ended up having a coffee at a new coffee shop:  urlLink The Perfect Cup . After this romantic moment we went shopping for food and DVDs for the night. Dylan cooked some kangaroo and I made a pumkin soup with milk. We finally watched Law & Order and then NCIS on TV before going back under the warm blanket again...I think we will keep the DVDs for today's night: we rented "Romeo & Juliet" and "Someone like you"...drama, romantic so everyone is pleased!!  Mondays...rrr...I wish Sundays could last forever...Today is special because we are officialy on holidays so we stayed in bed all morning before going to the city. We booked our seat on the train to go to Sydney and we will probably go to have a cup of coffee before going home...Tonight is fencing and then well, I let you guess...

      I, Adeline, love fencing. For the people who don't know what it is, you just have to imagine the Mousqueteers or Zorro, like them, I play with a foil.  I have been fencing for nearly 16 years now and I like to share my knowledge with any person who wants to try. In Adelaide, I joined the  urlLink Adelaide Swords Club  where I fence against children and adults, beginners or not. Back in France, my club is the  urlLink Masque de Fer de Lyon .  Because I enjoy teaching this sport, I decided to complete a Level 1 Coaching Principles at the  urlLink Volunteer and Coach Education Centre Courses  here in Adelaide. It is a day course and I am very excited. I am sure I will enjoy it.  So kids, as Inigo says in the movie "The Princess Bride": "My name is Inigo Montaya, you killed my father, prepare to die!"...Well, in fact maybe just a  bout should be enough!!

      Dylan and I are going to Sydney in a month but we are still wondering how to get there.  Sydney is approximately 2000 km North-East from Adelaide, the different modes of transport available are:  - the bus: foget it, last time Dylan spent 35h trying to fall asleep because there wasn't enough room for his tall legs!  - the plane: S.O.S.! we are both scared of flying!  - the train: haaa...here we go...12h on a train (yeah...it's not like the TGV! 50 km/h!!), sleeping on a seat with a blanket to keep warm...but the view is extraordinary! We get to cross the wild scenery between South Australia and New South Wales.  You can go to the web site of the  urlLink Australia's Great Train Journeys  to get some more information. There are only 2 trains per week, one thing is sure, we won't miss it!!

      Adeline has gone from her lovely country to go and live with her lover "Down Under". She spends her life in Adelaide, South Australia, and she studies at  urlLink Flinders University  to complete a Master of International Business Administration. She hopes to graduate in 2 years but knowing how lazy she is, she might be a student when she'll be 40!!  Anyway, the story starts; Adeline has completed the first semester of her degree and she has met a lot of very nice people in her class from different culture and background.  She is now on holidyas for a few weeks and she will take the opportunity to go to Sydney to welcome her sister Maud who is staying there to study for a year at the  urlLink University of New South Wales .  She will try to share with you all her adventures and stories during her stay in Australia. Don't hesitate to live comments (in any language, she will call for an interpretor in case she doesn't understand!!).  Have a great read and don't forget to enjoy your life!

      I went to my second class of the week this morning, the course is called "International Business in the Asia-Pacific Region". Our lecturer, Dr Tony English, has the reputation to be a very good teacher, interesting but tough and strict. He has been teaching for 5 years now at Flinders University and before that, he spent a lot of time as a business consultant in many countries in the Asia-Pacific Region.   This morning was an introduction of the topic and what we are going to study. His class seems to be very organised and I enjoyed a very important point he made about the objectives of this course: to get general knowledge about the historical, cultural, economic and political aspects of the countries in the Region.   Being French, I never had the chance to study a lot of those aspects of this Region when I was in High School. I studied French history, a bit of American and English history as well as WW I & II. Because the program is big and the time allowed for history/geography classes is short, I think we try to learn about our country first. I can't say I know everything about Fench history but I learned a few things that help me to understand the French society and culture today. " Our history builds our present!"   Anyway I am looking forward to learn from this topic and I am sure I will enjoy it as the lecturer seems to be really good and interesting!

       YEAAH!! I am lovin' it!!     &nbsp;   Well, hold on, hold on...I have to admit that I am very happy to be back at Uni because I will see my friends again, get to meet new students, learn about Finance, Marketing and Business in the Asia-Pacific Region... BUT I also have to admit that being on holidays is not bad at all, I get to know my bed better and become quite friendly with him... ;-)     &nbsp;   No tears, no no no!! Today was my first day and I was very excited to go. The first lecture of the Finance course was interesting and I look forward for the other two courses tomorrow and Wednesday. I bought my first text book, I have to start to read it... It&nbsp;sounds boring but I'm sure I will enjoy it very much!     &nbsp;   I sound probably positive and I have met some people who&nbsp;say "Uni is boring,&nbsp;I don't like it!". Well,&nbsp;believe me when&nbsp;I say that&nbsp;I am very lucky to be able to study where I am and at this level and I won't let this chance pass away. It can be hard but learning is a great opportunity, a gift and the benefits are much greater than the efforts to study. I enjoy studying, I hope I'll still enjoy it later and I hope more and more people will have access to it around the world!

        I would like to thank Dylan's parents - Agnes and Geoff - who live in Kalgourlie (Western Australia), for their message "Happy Bastille Day!" that we recieved on our phone on the 14th of July when we arrived in Sydney. It is very nice of&nbsp;them to have thought about it. I didn't get the chance to thank them and I hope it is not too late! - Thank you.     &nbsp;     If you wonder what "Bastille Day" is all about, check out    urlLink  here   .

       Okey dockey!!  &nbsp;  Here we are! Back in Adelaide for the start of the 2nd semester at Uni...Before telling you how excited I am to be back in class, I have to let you know that Dylan and I enjoyed our trip in   urlLink  Sydney   .  &nbsp;  We arrived at 10am on a Wednesday, happy because it meant that we would sleep confortably compared to the train - we forgot the pillow which can be quite useful sometimes! :-) - and after setting in the perfect hotel close to the airport - we could see it from our windows but it would cost us 35$ to go there in a taxi! - we decided to walk around in the city.  From the Harbour and its ferries to China Town and its City Market&nbsp;we were&nbsp;enchanted by the city. It was busy for sure but nice and enjoyable to visit.  &nbsp;  My sister Maud arrived well the next morning from Hong Kong, she stayed with us at the Formule 1 hotel for the week until we find a nice place for her to stay. We went to   urlLink  UNSW      with her, helped her with the paperwork and the accomodation - thanks to Dylan who passed all the phone calls ;-).  &nbsp;  Despite a couple of rainy days we decided to get out of bed and visit the town. We ended up most of the time in different shopping centres. I think that my sister will enjoy her time in Sydney and I am sure that Dylan loved our trip. We left last Wednesday and arrived in Adelaide the next Thursday. Tears didin't roll on our cheeks but it was a bit sad to say "Bye" to my sister. The good thing is that she will come in September to Adelaide and as my grand dad used to say "Good things need to end otherwise we wouldn't appreciate them so much!".  &nbsp;  We took some photos and we will post them up soon so you can have a look at our favourite sites in Sydney and our cutty little faces!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Dylan is doing much better than me! I am ranked 2,371 out of 10,483. I got 6 good results out of 8 this week end, which is not too bad. I hope to do better in the next two weeks. As we are going to Sydney, Dylan and I tipped in advance for the next two rounds. My tips are as follows:   Round 16 : West Coast, Kangaroos, Richmond, Brisbane, Adelaide, Geelong, Port and Melbourne.   Round 17 : Essendon, Kangaroos, Freo, Brisbane, Western Bulldogs, Port, Geelong and Melbourne.   GO THE EAGLES  !

      Hey hey hey!! One more day and we will be traveling on the Indian-Pacific to go to Sydney. I'm so excited!!  Dylan and I love to travel together. When we were in Europe we took the opportunity to visit some places from Spain to Switzerland and many more. I enjoy traveling because it's like going somewhere new, imagining that you will never come back. I have learnt a lot from my trips around the globe, not that I have been everywhere but being on your own in a completely different country makes you think and teaches you so much about the others and yourself. I wish I could do an around the world tour but I don't have the time and my wallet is too empty...:-(   Anyway, I hope I will do it one day with my Prince, but while waiting for the opportunity to come, we are looking forward to go to Sydney!!

      Today, I decided to get a better rank in the footy tips competition with  urlLink the Advertiser . I am ranked 2,499 out of 10,465 (not bad for a Frenchy!!) and I hope to go up.  My tips for this week end are: Collingwood - by 40 points West Coast (of course - this is the team I support!) Essendon Sydney Fremantle Brisbane Melbourne Port Adelaide - by 40 points  I don't know if I am right to tip those teams but I think they'll do great.  GO THE EAGLES!!

      Okey Dockey...Does everyone know when is "Bastille Day" and what it is? Let me tell you a bit about Frech history.  In 1789, the French "Third State" composed of the poorest people in the country decided to start a Revolution against the King (Louis XVI), the Nobles and the Church (the richest if you prefer). This Revolution strated officialy on the 14th of July when the Bastille prison in Paris was taken by the bourgeoisie and the peasants.         The prison doesn't exist anymore but if you go to visit the capitale of France, there is a square called "La Place de la Bastille" where the prison was before (Metro - Stop: Bastille).         The "totem" in the middle of the square represents what happen on the 14th of July 1789 as a symbol.  This date represents the beginning of the French Republic (as the Monarchy was taken over) and it became our National Day. We are now living in the 5th Republic, it seems strange but the history of France is quite big. I won't tell you everything in this page but I advise you to read and get some information about it if you are interested. I don't know any good website that I could recommend but the best would be a good book.  Anyway, all those words to tell you that Dylan and I will be in Sydney on the 14th of July, I wanted to surprise him by inviting him to have diner in a French restaurant in Sydney but I couldn't keep my mouth shut...It was too hard!! But but but, we are surely going to celebrate it, french cuisine and french wine...yumi...VIVE LA FRANCE!

      Well well well...I apology for my...lazzyness...My holidays are getting over my natural discipline and I realise that I fell in love with my bed a couple of days ago...:-)  One more week in Adelaide and we will then take the train to go to Sydney. I had my sister and my family on the phone two days ago: Maud (sister) seems very excited but also scared to spend one year with kangaroos, Bernadette (Mum) seems sad but also excited because she will have the appartment with Dad for them only...hum...I wonder what will happen... not another sister or brother please!!! ;-)  Anyway, lets get back to US...Our holidays are going very well, we spent most of our time together walking in the city, shopping (bad for our wallets) and doing some sport (besides the time spent in bed!!). Well, fortunatly we are going to travel a bit, I think we need to escape for  a week...In fact we are looking forward to welcome my sister and celebrate her arrival...with aussie beers of course!!

      Dylan and I entered a footy tipping competition with the local newspaper -  urlLink The Advertiser .  There are 22 rounds of Australian football during the season and the 16 teams play against each other until the 22nd round. After that, the 8 top teams on the ladder get to play in the final rounds, it is a bit like soccer in France (for the ones who don't know).  Well, this week end is round 14 and I got to be ranked 2,550 out of 10,449 tippers. Not bad for a Frenchy, hey!  Anyway, I hope I will get better and better, just for fun...In fact I wouldn't mind winning the first price, going on holiday with my prince in the Bahamas isn't a bad idea!! Hope makes you live!!

      Ok, today, let's talk about...fencing!  You probably know what the sport is about. I started fencing because I loved Zorro when I wsa a kid, and I didn't want to do the same sport as my brother.  I will talk about this fantastic sport regularly because I love it. I would like to give you some information about it and today I thought I would start with the number of weapon that you can play:  -  Foil         It is he lightest, you can hit only with the point and the target area is represented by the figure below (red area):        -  Epee         It is the heaviest, you can only hit with the point and the target is represented by the figure below (red area):        -  Sabre         You can hit with the point AND the blade and the target is reprsented by the figure below:        In terms of rules, epee "doesn't have any rules" which means that the first to hit the other gets the point and if the two fencers hit each other at the same time there is a point for each of them. Foil and Sabre work on the same rules: there is a pripority to the fencer who is attacking.   In the next lesson, I will talk about the equipment needed to fence.  If you are interesting in this sport and want to find more about it, I advise you to look up on the website of your country's federation. For the people living in France, you can click on the  urlLink French Federation website .

      Friday = no class at Uni, BUT as a good student that I intent to be, I try to study. I am spending my day at the  urlLink State Library  in the City.  I am meeting one of my fencing friend for lunch, her name is Sarah. I met her 2 years ago when I first arrived in Adelaide.   At 1pm I will be back at the library and I will try to think about International Finance, not that interesting but if I want to be a business woman one day, I have to deal with it I suppose.  Then at 5pm, let's go to work, I am doing the dishes in a pizzeria - pretty interesting job but lovely people I work with.  Finaly, the best part of my day will be to meet Dylan at home to have diner...I wish it could be 11.15pm already...  Hope you are having a good day!

      I hope that I didn't hurt anyone...I appology for my silence, I was busy trying to finish an assignment for my International Marketing class - we had to present (2 friends and me) the topic about the influence of culture in International Marketing. Interesting but long. the presentation lasted for 2h30min. a record I think in the history of the course.  Anyway, it can't be an excuse I suppose and I really appology for that. Dylan is is much more disciplined than me - and his blog is actually fantastic - have a look by clicking  urlLink here !!  Have fun!
