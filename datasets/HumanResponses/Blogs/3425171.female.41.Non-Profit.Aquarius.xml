						   I have been busy cataloging the music I am selling on eBay, so I really hadn't had the chance to blog the last day or so.    Yesterday when I went to feed the horses, they were pretty good about coming up, but I had to take a bucket of grain with me.  Today, they were not quite as far back, and they came right up for dinner.  They really didn't want to leave their stalls after they ate either - but we are already getting into that part of year that the heat is so oppressive that it really isn't doing them any favors by locking them up for the night.  Leavy rides his bike while the horses are eating, he also helps me catch them up and fill their feeders and water buckets.  He also plays with the wheelbarrow, and rakes designs into the sand with the rake.  He had kind of a dandy idea today - he was talking about putting fans on the handlebars of his bicycle, and he would have extra air moving over him while he was riding a little slower.  I thought it was a good idea.  :)  The baby's chin is healing up nice, and he is his normal rough and tumble self.  That is the happiest baby - he is at an age where he is into everything all the time, but he never complains.  He doesn't complain that he is hungry - even when he is - he just kind of goes into free range baby mode.  I try to keep him on three meals a day with snacks - but when he starts putting things into his mouth, you can pretty well bet he is ready for another snack.  Rex is doing a lot trying to help me out, between taking the pictures of the records I am listing, to watching his baby brother while I am either cataloging or feeding the horses.    Anyhow, enough for today.

						   Last night we went back out and caught up the horses and put them in their stalls to feed them.  I decided to leave them there overnight, so they would know where their rooms were at. We had fun trying to catch them to put them up for the night though.  The horses were at the furthest part of the pasture, and were still kind of nervous about the horses that were already established in the pasture.  Everything we got them halfway close to the barn, the other horses wanted to come take a sniff of them, and they would run off away from them again.  So after about an hour and 60 acres of crossways, back, forth and diagonally, we managed to get them into the barn.  All went pretty smooth after that.  This morning I went to feed them before I turned them out, and while they were eating, the guy that had all of the appaloosas in the field showed up - he seemed like a pretty nice guy.  But I got the grand and formal introduction to everyone, and he told me their quirks and kinks.  They are a pretty good bunch of ponies...  Anyhow, we talked for a little while, and then I turned Rosie and Houdini, and took a bit of a walk around the pasture.  Leavy got to drive one of his remote control cars around, and help with the horses...  He likes getting out and doing stuff like that...  enough for now - laters

						   I got the horses moved finally.  And as bad as I have been procrastinating, it felt good to go out and do everything that I did today.  When I removed Rosie from the pasture she had been, Dell tried to sneak out with her.  I closed the gate on her, and she took off screaming, bucking and running.  She was pretty heartbroken that she didn't get to come with, but she needs to finish her training.  Rosie was the bestest girl of all time - I can't believe I got a horse as well mannered and as sweet as her.  And Houdini/Dutch - not sure what I am going to call him, but he is pretty good kid too.  When I turned them loose out in the pasture here in Pasadena, they wandered out - then all the horses that were already out there started chasing them around.  I think it is Laird's horse Taz that did the most chasing - and he chased Rosie for no less than 20 minutes at a dead run.  He was trying to herd her somewhere - but I really couldn't tell where.  He would chase her into the herd, then back out of it - and this went on and on. Finally I think he just got tired of chasing her.  well, I am dirty, sweaty and tired.  Will try to post again later...

						   The chub is having a bad day.  He fell this morning, and split his chin open.  We took him to the Dr, and while the Dr really wanted to put stitches in it, I wouldn't let her.  I think that the anesthetic the give kids to numb it is more traumatizing than the original injury - or at least was in this case.  So at my request she put steristrips on it - and he is much much better now.  But it was pretty horrible - like a little gaping mouth on the underside of his chin.  Just horrible.  He fell just a short while ago - he is like a mountain goat, thinking he can climb anything.  I thought he was in with Rex, Rex thought I had him - end result?  the big cooking pot he was using to climb on slid out from under him and he landed on the floor with a pretty solid thump.  Glad he landed on his bottom.  Well, Rex is peeling shrimp right now - I really need to go help him.  catch ya laters.

						   Well - I got to learn that Orkut doesn't have any email attached to it.  That was kind of a disappointment - but then again, being it is a community type of setup, I suspect that I will at least find nice people to talk to.  Did have something kind of strange happen though.  Some guy started writing my son and demanding to know how he got his account - and started saying that it was an invite that was stolen from him.  After emailing back and forth with him, I went to gmail swap and discovered that he is buying these things up at a high rate of volume, and I would suspect that he is selling them.  He was being quite the jerk to people too - he would put out a cash offer, and then when they would accept his offer, he would drop his price.  It is kind of sad to see something that had such good intentions enable the worstest people with that kind of ability.  It would be a good thing if the thing could go public - and take this ability out of their hands.  Anyhow, it is nice and quiet in the house right now.  The baby is finishing up his late night snack, the ten year old is in bed asleep and the 18 year old is watching his movie in the other room.  Even the dog is quiet.  They say that Christmas eve is quiet - it isn't.  The little ones are too busy trying to catch Santa in the act.  This is a quiet night...

						   Well, I managed to get my son a gmail account today, and myself an orkut account.  I may be wrong - but I believe that orkut will be a more enjoyable thing to have once gmail goes public.  I got the one for the boy, because he is young and is still at that age where it is kind of neat to have what not that many of his friends have.  But my personal opinion is that once gmail goes public, while it would be nice to have it, it is going to be inundated with people too.  And more than that, since everyone will have it, it won't be that terribly special.  Anyhow, today was Rex's last day of school - and he was stoked.  I am glad for him too.  He has worked awfully hard, and due to the school district not keeping their word, he didn't get as much credit as he had worked for.  But being young, time is on his side, and we will just give it as much time as he needs to get what he needs done.  anyhow, enough for today.

						   Rex got off to school today - today is only a half day, and tomorrow - also a half day is the last day.  He is pretty happy about it.  I have been photographing and cataloging some old vinyl records that I am fixing to list on ebay.  It is time consuming, but I have been moving these things from room to room for the last 12 years, and it is time for them to go.  I hate to throw them away, because a lot of them are old, and from names that you no longer see - or names that have changed, like John Cougar Mellancamp's old album where he was Johnny Cougar.  And other things like that.  The collection belongs to my first husband, who died in 92.  I tried my best to keep them, but it is at the point that keeping them is damaging them more than getting rid of them.  Anyhow, I am keeping pretty busy with these - so it will be a few days before I have anything interesting to say.

						   We just got back from the hotwheel races at toys r us. Space city hotwheels set up the races for the kids, and while Leavy didn't win anything, at least he had fun.  He got a case of hotwheels while he was there - it had some new rare car with no paint on it - I can't remember what it is called, and a treasure hunt.  We need to look and see what all he needs to get to complete certain sets, and I need to check and see what are considered rares and what he is just as well off opening and playing with.  We got the stalls ready yesterday to move the horses to this side of town, but things keep coming up that I can't get over there to move them.  At least I know they are getting top of hte line care while they are where they are at, and being paid through the end of hte month kind of helps too.

						   I seem to be surrounded.  Three kids, four horses and one fat lipped dog.  They all do cute things - well, not all of them.  But I find them entertaining.  I hope you will find it cute too.  Let me introduce you to the kids - there is Rex, he is 18 and in dire need of a girlfriend.  As his mom, I think he needs a smart girl.  Then there is Leavy - my impudent genius.  He is ten.  Kind of sick at the moment, or he would want to create his own blog.  Then there is the Chubby Butt - Chub for short.  He swings wildly between being diurnal and nocturnal.  He seems to gain about two hours a day, so there is no telling what time he will be awake in say... June.  The horses: Houdini - he came off of the indian reservation near Cuba, New Mexico.  He was nearly starved out when I bought him.  We got him nice and fat, then he caught pnuemonia just before Christmas.  He dropped a lot of that weight when he was sick - but most of it is back on now.  I will be posting pictures.  Rosie - she too is a navajo horse - and has the offending bar n and navajo stack on her left hip.  She is about 6, and is just the sweetest, most demure mare you have ever seen.  Dell - she is a registered palomino quarter filly.  She just turned two about a month ago, and is training right now.  Jeffrey - part monkey and part elephant and all in a horse's clothing.  He is the most unique equine I have ever seen, and he is the old time drafty halfinger.  He is a 6 year old gelding.  The dog.  He has perfected the art of ignorance.  He snores louder than any man ever could, eats things that should by all rights kill him, can clear a room after raiding the garbage, and he yodels instead of barks.  He falls under the so ugly he is cute category.  Only he isn't cute, he is only ugly...  :)  The Evil Grandpa.  Boy - shame that every family doesn't have one of these.  Grandpa is off in China marrying some woman that he met on the internet - and she is a regular winner too.  Grandma died Nov. 21, had the evil grandpa tell her that getting cancer was the best thing that ever happened to her just days before she died.  He lied to her on her deathbed, is currently lying to his new bride.  He is just horrible beyond words.  Jason and Freddy doesn't hold a candle to him.  Grandpa's preferred method of dispatching old faithful dogs is shooting them with a .22 after a lifetime of service.  One of the dogs got to look down the barrel of the .22 about 6 times(kind of a misfired type of a deal), because the shell in there was too old/damp to fire, and he was too cheap to buy a fresh box.  He wouldn't even consider a vet.  But we can devote an entire gig to grandpa and his exploits - if you guys want to hear more about him, just say so. Otherwise I will just let you know - there is an evil grandpa lurking in our family.

						   They keep saying rain - then we get no rain.  For which I am kind of glad - but I hate leaving the horses locked up and then we get no rain.  So I am leaving them locked up for no reason.  Lairds old gelding is sick - there hasn't been any new horses to the pasture, so I think he just caught a cold from being out in the rain.  Poor old thing is snotting up, and he looks like he feels miserable.  He started him on penecillin last night - so I hope the old boy pulls through this pretty quick.  The evil grandpa is doing more shit, so now I have had to ask him to quit calling here - everythign he has to say I want via email, because he says one thing, then changes it to make him self look better and everyone else look worse.  But after sending him a couple of emails yesterday, where I could show him what he had to say, vs. what he is now claiming he had to say, and I haven't heard from him since.  He is crying about wanting nearly a thousand dollars for feeding a pony for 3 months, or he is goign to take his own grandsons pony and sell it to recoup to supposed costs.  The day we went to the sale, I went and registered - and he didn't.  So I bought the pony, he bought the paint filly, and the following day I bought the palomino filly.  He went ahead and wrote the check for all three, and I wrote him checks to pay him back for everything, except for his filly.  He is now trying to pull the "I still have the checks where I paid for all three of those horses, and you don't" kind of bullshit, to which I informed him that I still have the checks where I paid him back for everything.  That wasn't even teh good part.  Even after I paid him back for the pony, he kept harping and harping about how Leavy needed to thank him for the pony - and that if he hadn't had his checkbook with him at the time, Leavy never could have had the pony.  I had my checkbook, but he said it woudl be fine to just write a check his self and for me to pay him back, just as what did happen.  Anyhow, I asked Leavy to thank him, even though grandpa did nothing significant for the boy concerning the pony - and now he is threatening to sell the boys christmas present.  What a piece of shit.  That is just the tip of hte iceberg - but it is really upsetting to me to have to relive every back stabbing ass biting thing he has done in hte past three days.  anyhow, nuff for now.

						   Last night I went to feed and the Tacketts were already there.  First time in a while I had gotten to see Barbara - and it was good to see her.  After I got my two in, Laird showed up and so we all got to chatting and just talking - it was pretty enjoyable.  Grandpa started his shit again yesterday and I ended up having the phone we let him have suspended.  And then all the vicious emails.  I really don't want to talk to him.  I am sick and tired of listening to his ugly comments, fingerpointing, snide insults and so forth.  Now he is threatening to sell the pony we got Leavy for Christmas.  He offered to meet me in abilene with him in april then renegged.  I tried to pick him up in may before he went to china and he wanted to have a face to face confrontation, and I spent too many years getting beat up by that jerk as a child to not hurt him if he even makes a move towards me.  I don't want to get ugly about things and made arrangements pick the horse up someplace that wasn't there.  Now he is claiming that the horse broke buildings, and that he wants me to pay for new buildings.  A year or so ago, the very said building was burglerized and left open.  How am I to believe that the pony broke the door in and spent time in there - I just don't see it happening.  Anyhow, grandpa announced a will a few months ago that I believe was false.  Oh, I believe he went to a lawyer and had one drawn up, but I have a hard time believing that days after he told my mom that getting cancer and being in the process of dying was the best thing that ever happened to her - that she would just turn her back on the grandkids and leave it all to him so he could marry a (as she put it - her worst feat) a woman from a third world country.  So everytime I mention that I am going to probate her will, and would fight her will against the one he claims he has - he gets really loud, really offensive and starts all kinds of threats.  I wish god would take him home.

						   Did I tell you that I managed a trade for a kfc recipe book on gmailswap?  I liked it so much, I sent the guy a second invitation.  We could live on kfc coleslaw...  :)  Went to feed tonight, not really anything spectacular happened.  I got the horses in and eating, went over to talk to sam about that mare of his - she is a pretty bad jose.  I really don't sanction the slaughter of horses for meat, but she is one that it wouldn't be that bad a thing to have it happen.  She is nice enough when you are on the ground, but she has tried on multiple occasions to kill him and his son.  He doesn't realize she is trying to kill them, but she darned sure is.  She does this cutesy little runaway thing, to where she takes off running, heads straight for whatever she feels will do the most damage, and then goes to a dead stop.  With him she headed for a barbed wire fence.  With his son, she headed for a ship container, about a 40 foot steel box, full of hay.  She ran right to it and them dead stop.  I really don't feel this is a standard runaway, but heading them into something that will do great bodily harm, she is showing extreme malice.  I suggested to him that he pull her head around so she could only run in small circles, and he told me he tried that, and the sow just ran with her head pulled completely sideways, and she still just kept running.  The hell of it is, he works with her everyday, trying to get her to mind her manners, and she just keeps getting worse and worse.  She is without a doubt a smart horse.  Not the prettiest in the world, but sharp as a whip.  But there is a vein of really bad in her, and a novice doesn't need her.  He made the offhand comment to me today that he might offer her to me pretty cheap, I didn't say anything to him, but I can get good horses cheap.  Horses that may not know all the fancy stuff, but can at least mind their manners, and won't try to hurt you.  I want to try to ride her, and I am sure that Sam will let me try to ride her.  But Levi doesn't want me to ride her, and on that, I can kind of understand why. If I get hurt, he can't go back to the boat - and that would be compromising our life at many different levels.  But she needs someone to get on her and let her know that they aren't goign to tolerate that crap.  Then again on the other hand, I have straightened out spoiled horses before, and while I got something I could control, it really didn't help the next person in line if the horse thought it could get away with something.  Leavy is still feeling pretty crappy, Rex is back to sleeping at nights, the baby is just like a hurricane - and Gus is being stupid.  So - things are all good here.   The ponies were happy to see me last night, and why not.  I brush them, keep the flies off of them, give them goodies and send food.  Not too much to not like there...  :)  I can't tell everyone enough how the horses give me such a sense of well being and just give me something to do that is strictly leisure.  The neighbor said the other day that one time he wanted a horse for all of two hours, until he found out how much work they were.  I don't see it as work, I just go out and clean, feed and just enjoy every moment I spend out there.  I was goign to ride tonight, but then it started looking like the weather wanted to get bad, so I just went home after they were done eating...  'nuff for now...  :) /riding off into the sunset...

						   Well, I got Leavy to the dr today - he said it is time to call in a pediatric gi.  All of his blood and urine levels were normal, all of his enzyme levels tht they checked for were normal, remember when I said the ultrasound levels were normal?  Well - so that puts him at normal for now.  The dr did say that so much more could be determined by an upper gi and endoscopy, which is true, but he also felt that a gi would have more ideas of what could be creating these kinds of problems.  So first thing Monday morning, we start calling ped gi's and see how soon we can get the boy into one.  In the meantime, Rex, the baby, the horses and gus are all doing good.  nuff for now.

						   well - this morning I went and fed, waited for my auctions on ebay to end then went to bed.  When I got up, it was done raining for the day, so I went and turned the horses loose.  When I went to go catch them back up for dinner, while backing out of the driveway, I backed into the neighbors car.  Didn't even see it.  Guess that it what happens when you mix a really big truck with a really small car.  Anyhow, good thing Carlos x the street yelled when he did, or I would have done a lot more damage than I did.  So I am very thankful for that much.  I told them that they need to get an estimate on it - and if it is low, I will pay it out of pocket.  If it is high, I will submit it to the insurance company.  And I apologized profusely.  I really did feel bad about it.  About a year and a half ago, I was backing out of the driveway, and the little car honked it's horn at me.  I slammed on the brakes and managed to get stopped in time that time.  I do however (and don't think I am trying to get our of blame on this one - I keep almost hitting that same car over and over - maybe now it is out of my system) wish that they would start parking in their driveway and not on both sides of their driveway out on teh street.  It doesn't give me a wide spot in either direction to back out at.  Houdini is now starting to make all of his trips into the barn at a dead run.  All the other horses, especially Whiskey run at him, and quite frankly, beat the crap out of him.  Whiskey is quite smitten with Rosie, and I think he is jealous of them going into the barn together.  He is always with her in the pasture, when they are grazing.  Kind of funny - the social lives of horses - at first, cherry was her best friend.  Then star.  Now it is whiskey - and I think they graze around all day sharing their life's tales with each other.  No one likes Houdini.  And in truth, after he did bucky horse while trying to kick at me, I didn't like him too much for a moment either.  But I think he had just had a really bad day yesterday - being beat up by the other horses, getting his feet trimmed, then his stall wasn't done when he decided he wanted to eat - really not his fault.  Plus - it was a new shiny white bucket.  I don't think he much cared for the bucket.  Kind of funny when you think about it - he was trying to kick the bucket... (get it?  ;)  )  Kids are all doing about as good as they are going to do.  Leavy has a dr's appt tomorrow, maybe they can find something.

						   I have been busy-busy.  In a nutshell, I got the horses feet trimmed today, cleaned out stalls - was in the process of taking a bucket out of houdini's stall, and he decided to do bucky-horse at me with his hind legs.  wasn't real happy with him.  anyhow, that is about it for now - I have a chance to go to sleep, I am going to try to take it.  oh - and it has been raining all the time.

						   Yesterday morning (actually about noon'ish) I got to talk to Joe myself.  I think I got him straightened out.  I was talking to Levi, and Joe was bouncing around the wheelhouse like a 7 year old that ate too much chocolate, and everything Levi said to me, he had a smart assed comment for.  Then at one point, he took the phone from Levi's pocket, pulled the ear bud plug out of it, and started yelling "hey, hey" into my ear.  :)  I said "Joe?"  and he asked me what Levi's real name was.  I said "Joe - you and me are going to have a little talk."  He got quiet for a minute. Then he asked "about what?" and I proceeded to tell him that Leavy was very sick, that he couldn't eat, that we had been back and forth to doctors and that his calling every 15 minutes about stupid boat stuff just wasn't going to cut it.  He popped in with the smart assed comment about "can he wipe his ass?"  And I told him he could - and he said if he could wipe his ass, then he could feed his self.  Well...  about that time I started getting loud with him, and I told him that the boy was sick, that he was pulling Levi out of the dr's offices or imaging labs when he was calling and that I didn't care if the boat was sitting at the bottom of the bay, as long as Levi wasn't on it, it wasn't as important as the boy's health.  I told him that if he pulled Levi out of a dr's office ONE MORE TIME for some stupid lunch meat question, or anything that wasn't just dead serious, that if I could get my hands around his fat freaking neck, I was going to throttle him.  I told him that I was not going to tolerate his crap while we were trying to deal with Leavy being as sick as he is, and that if it happened one more time, I was going to go wherever the boat was, and just choke the living shit out of him.  He said ok.  I hope it meant ok, that he isn't going to do that shit anymore.  Then he started again about Levi's first name - I told him if he really needed to see it, he ought to ask if he could see his license.  Well, he took off hooting and jumping around the wheelhouse and hollering "it was your wife that told me to ask to see your license" and other stupid things.  Joe pissed me off - but he is like a kid in so many ways it is cute.  Thank god I didnt have any brothers, or I wouldn't have kind of laughed when he did that.    The boat blew that brand new engine last night.  That thing has been a lemon since it was installed.  They have been back in the shipyard quite a few times since they put it in about 3 weeks - a month ago?  So they are going back to the shipyard today, I guess they were pretty close in to port arthur when it happened.  Good thing it was there, and not between brownsville and corpus.

						   Today, I went and bought feed - and just left it in the back of the truck until I went to feed tonight.  When I got to the stable, I proceeded to pull into the pasture, so I could unload feed right from the barn.  As I pulled into the gate, I noticed an older red dually out by the barn, and a small silver car right in front of the barn gate.  I pulled on in, backed as close to the barn gate as I could - and saw the people there putting saddles back into the back of the truck.  Didn't think too much about it.  I left the truck running - the baby was asleep in the truck, and Leavy was watching a movie in there, and it was really nice and cool in the truck.  I went started getting a bag of feed out of the truck, and Laird came out and offered to help me carry feed in, so of course - I accepted his offer.  We get to the feed stall, and he says to me "you just missed the show", so I asked him "what show?"  He proceeded to tell me that the woman that owns that mare that is starving out in the pasture that is nursing the colt and the guy with her tried to catch her up and ride her.  They tied her to a tree, I don't know what they were doing, but apparently the colt took off, and the mare went nuts and got loose.  The woman tried to catch her again, but couldn't.  So she took off in her car, cussing and yelling, and as her horse took off running to try to escape the car, all the horses took off running.  She was driving in circles in the pasture yelling and screaming at the horse, all the other horses were weaving back and forth in front of the car which was racing around the field.  Finally they cut her out of the herd with the car, and managed to corner her.  Keep in mind - we had a heat index of about 104 at the time this was happening(late afternoon in houston in the summertime).  Well, from what he was saying, the fella put a saddle on the mare and she took off bucking.  Just a couple of days ago I seen her letting 2-3 kids on her back, and without a saddle or bridle or halter even, she was cruising around walking with them kids just as calm as could be.  I guess that wasn't the case today.  Anyhow the story goes she was trying to kick them and everything else, the woman still cussing and yelling at the horse, and at some point they let her go.  Then they went to the back pasture - which all the horses in that field were running when the great car chase was happening too.  Anyhow, they have a 4 year old filly that has a bad pastern, and they went out there, and as soon as they halfway close to her, they started the yelling and screaming bit again - so the horse took off.  Laird told them that no horse was going to go up to anyone that acted that way - took the lead rope from them, and walked up to her and dropped the rope around her neck.  He led her right up to them.  They took her into the front pasture where they had already been chasing the horses, and proceeded to saddle her up.  Did I mention that she isn't broke to ride?  It is my understanding that the guy hopped up on her and she took off bucking, and he pulled her head up enough that she couldn't buck, but she did start rearing up, and since they were right by the car that the lady was chasing the horses with, and the horse hit the car a couple of times with her front feet and dented it.  More beating, cussing and screaming ensued.  Anyohow this filly had a bad pastern to start with - and by the time they let her loose, she was hurting so badly that she could hardly walk on it.  I have said several times that I was goign to call the sheriffs dept about the way her horses are treated - she doesn't feed them, even in the worst of storms they are out in the lightening and rain, and that mare is about 250 lbs light.  You can see her backbone, you can see the top of her rib cage, as well as all of her ribs - you can see her spine pretty danged clearly on the top of her butt.  But David's horses aren't as fat as they could be and he doesn't want me to call.  So I let it go a week or so, and start thinking I am going to call the sheriffs dept again - and this time I am told that someone whose horses are there (they are all fat and healthy - well cared for)that their spouse works for the sheriff's dept and it would look bad if someone else called the spca or sheriff's dept.  So in trying to keep the peace, I wait to see if anything occurs in the turning of her in.  Nothing does.  I originally made the offer to donate the feed so that the skinny horse can at least have the resources needed to nurse her baby.  This is before I met the woman that owned them.  Everyone there kept telling me that she was a real peice of work(when I asked them to tell her), and that I would be a lot better off just not getting involved with her.  So I didn't make the offer to her.  But the more I got to thinking about it, I also realized that even if I did feed that mare until the colt was off of her, then what?  The horse would still belong to the same owner that didn't care about her, didn't care for her and that the horse would still be in the same boat.  About all that feeding her would accomplish would be for her to remain in that womans possession longer, and make it harder to prove that she is being starved slowly.  There is no grass out there, it is only about half an inch long and I would suspect that every bite that horse takes of that grass, she is getting dirt with it.  Tomorrow, I am going to implore the spouse of the boarder who is with the sheriff's dept to do what is needed to do, or regardless of proper protocol and I am going to turn her in.  That 4 year old is probably permanently crippled as a result of that woman's neglect, then trying to ride her on top of it.  And any idiot that would chase a horse with a car doesn't need to be around animals anyhow.  The truly tragic part of all of this is that even if they take the horses from her, they won't do anything to her.  Oh, she may get probation, but nothing will be done to prevent her from ruining and neglecting another animal.  Second point tonight - my dad hollered at me on yahoo, and he said that gal he married (she works in an imaging lab in Nanning) kind of agreed with me on it being Leavy's pancreas, and gave some very specific trails to follow.  And from what he was telling me she said, it was the most credible thing I have heard.  A hell of a lot more credible than what the one dr was saying anyhow.  I am goign to take him to the local dr, and ask that they request an imaging lab to do a cat scan on him - that is what she said was the best way to detect the problem she said it was.  This way when our regular dr comes back from vacation, it will all be right there in his hands.  I just hope that he is open to what she is saying she things.  And I hate to say it, I think she is right on the money from what he was telling me.  She said that Leavy shouldn't be eating solid foods, and that solid foods cause all the liquid to leave the pancreas (at least this is the way my dad was telling me - he might have gotten body parts wrong) and that is what is causing the nausea and pain.  But on a much, much brighter note, she told him that the way they treat this at the hospital she works at (is treatment the same all over the world?) is they take away all foods from them, start them on an iv, then slowly start them back on liquids, give them an antibiotic, and after the antibiotic has had a chance to work, then they start them back on foods.  Which if that is true, and how they treat it here, is very good news.  It means that no surgery is involved, and that there is a definite "cure" involved.  I don't think there is a thought in the world that is as relieving to parents as knowing that their child can be fixed.  I wasn't real happy that he lied to my mom on her death bed - but if she is right about Leavy, and this saves his life, I think even my mom would have approved of her.  My mom loved the kids way more than anyone could believe possible, and she would be a wreck right now if she was alive.  Those two things were big enough that I can't think of anything else noteworthy that happened today.  Oh - Houdini had a cut across his entire chest, like he ran into wire - don't know if that happened when the horses were freaked out by the car chase - or if one of the other horses chased him into it.  I think it was the former, because usually when they chase him, they only chase him 20 or 30 feet - and that is about as long as their attention span lasts when chasing him.  I think him retreating is enough to satisfy their need to prove dominance.  oh - if Yan Ling is right, I am about to eat a truckload of crow.  I don't know what I can do to make amends to her - for what I said.  Maybe in the process of finding a way to try to make it right, I can learn to not say ugly things to people.

						   Ok.  Got Levi back on the boat this morning - hated to see him go.  Having a hell of a problem with Joe Diggs on the boat - he is capt on the boat, and apparently it is a combination of Levi missing a few things as far as the fine details go - but also about Joe being too lazy to turn around and check the receipt from the store.  There was a big issue about the Gerlands lunch meat order.  Levi called in the lunch meat order before the boat got to the dock, because by the time the boat was goign to be in, the deli was goign to be closed.  I took him for the grocery order, they ran the lunch meat through the register(with all hte other groceries) and it went to the boat.  This past week while we were running Leavy back and forth to the dr, Joe kept calling and calling, too lazy to get the receipt out of the file cabinet, and look at it.  So while we were at an imaging lab, and Leavy was having an ultrasound done to see if they could see any anomolies with his pancreas, liver, gall bladder and kidneys, Levi had to leave the room (in the middle of the procedure) - it was Joe calling saying that the store was claiming that the boat didn't run the meat through the register, and ragging about it.  And I was just completely and totally disgusted by it.  I am about ready to contact the company, and write a letter of complaint about it.  I am certain that Mr. Blessey would consider the boy more important than the lunch meat.  And there were 5 or 6 calls about the lunchmeat - and (I can't say this enough) all he had to do was LOOK AT THE RECEIPT.  Anyhow, in the meantime, nearly every night Leavy just cries and cries - says he feels old, and that he doesn't think he is goign to survive this problem.  He is just cries all the time - saying he isn't going to live to see his brother grow up, and that he is going to miss me.  It is a heart rending thing when you have a ten year old that thinks he is going to die - and the really bad part of it is, I am afraid that this problem is goign to kill him too.  He doesn't hardly eat, he gets the shakes at night from not being able to keep warm enough - if you can imagine - being cold in Houston in the summertime.  Even when he is outside.  On an unrelated note, I feel that the insurance companies own the government, and that they get to write rules and we the people are just getting trampled by him.  Leavy needs to be in the hospital, and they won't put him in there, because it would cost money.  It is far easier to just as cheaply as possible - one test at a time, with weeks between them.  I am terrified that we are goign to lose him while they just kind of fiddlestick around.  anyhow, enough for now - I will get back to this later today.  Last night we were out messing with the horses - we had gotten the bareback pads in, and so we thought we would try them out.  They looked really good, but the darned thing for cinching them up didn't work as good as I had hoped it would.  I am going to have to modify the things.  Levi was riding rosie with one, and the things loosen up on their own - so we had one of those scenarios where rosie slipped in the mud, he lost his balance a little, because the pad had worked it's way loose, it slid down to her side, and he fell off.  Kind of freaked her out too.  Anyhow, I think I can put an english style girth on it, and it would be easy to have an upholstery shop sew in new buckles.  Also going to have to fix the stirrups on them - boy, those are about some cheap assed stirrups.  :)  But they are too long for Leavy to be able to reach his feet into them, so I am goign to have a shop take up the slack in one.  I really can't sew to save my life, but more than that, I don't have the heavy sewing machine needed to sew it in such a manner that it won't come undone while he is in need of them.

						   We went out and messed with the horses tonight.  Leavy rode Houdini around bareback and I rode Rosie real quick (long enough to make sure she wasn't going to buck), then Levi rode her around a bit.  She rides like a dream - not a vice in that good girl.  Leavy is feeling fair tonight...  Rex is doing good and the baby is finally asleep.  I dont thikn he sleeps much at all.

						   Leavy is getting worse again - he hardly ate yesterday, and now he says the pain is back.  Oddly enough - I am starting to get pains in my liver are - but I don't think anythign is wrong with me.  I suspect it is sympathy pains for Leavy.  But he eats something and a few hours later he is sick again.  Wished I knew of a dr in the area.  Levi just left to go clean stalls.  He really likes spending time with the horses, and I think he enjoys the solitude of the barn.  anyhow by this afternoon, something may have happened - will be back then.

						   We had more rain today, and the pasture was borderline flooded.  There was water as deep as 3 inches in someplaces today, had a few high spots where the horses that wanted semi-dry grass could eat.  Some of the horses were grazing in the deeper parts of the water - I guess it is a novelty to them.  All of the bumps are gone from the horses - except for one big one on Rosie.  It may be a bug bite.  I am pretty relieved about that.  Leavy is still eating pretty good.  He said he feels just a little bit sick, but overall, he is feeling pretty good.  He is eating way more than he did.  We went and took pictures of Dell today - that filly is a show stopper.  I cannot believe a horse can be built that good, have that kind of color and be mine.  Nothing short of incredible...  anyhow enough for now.  Oh - and grandpa got home from china.

						   Well, we had a hell of a rain today - glad we left the horses in while it rained.  I think they are the only horses in the back field that miss every big thunderstorm.  Rosie is in heat  - which is a good thing.  From what I am reading, the wnv shot causes mares to abort, or create truly horrendous birth defects, and so I am glad that she is open for the series of shots.  Also - the rash is slowly dissapearing on her, Houdini still has quite a bit of it on him.  Leavy rode Houdini for a while tonight, bareback and in the barn, but at least it is getting him used to it.  We put the baby on Houdini - he would take a step and stop.  Take a step and stop.  The baby layed down so his head was on the horse's neck, and Houdini wouldn't take a step.  He was worried that the baby would fall.  Levi held onto to the baby while he was on the horse - but I don't think Houdini knew that.  'nuff for now -

						   we took some pictures of the horses today - we managed to get some of Rosie and Houdini, but it started raining before we could go take some of Dell.  They still have their rashes, but they are looking good other than that.  Neither one of them were running a fever...  Let me see if I can figure out how the photoblogging works, maybe I can add some pics to this.

						   This evening when we went to catch the horses, Houdini was broke out in a rash on the front half of his body.  Tonight (late) when we went to turn them out, Rosie had it too, only hers was much worse.  She has oozing welts, and the same rash on the front half of her body.  At this point, I am just hoping that I don't lose them from the shot.  I am about halfway thinking about going back out there tonight, and taking their temperatures.  They are the only two horses in the field that are broke out in rash, and the only two out there that have had their shots.  I just don't know - this isn't a good thing.  Anyhow, we went out to the sale in Huffman, and got a bridle and a couple of curb chains.  I was goign to pick up a nylon bridle too, but they wanted way too much for them.  Enough for now, I need to do a few things  - I am pretty worried about them horses...

						   Oh - got an email from grandpa last night - he got married again, to that chinese woman that needs a ticket out of china.  He keeps telling me that she thinks this or she thinks that about my boy being sick - I am sorry.  An ultrasound tech is not a dr, and I finally had to tell him this morning that I am not interested in her opinion - and if she wants to keep the peace, she will keep her distance.  Did I tell you guys that he emphatically promised my mom on her death bed that he would never marry again?  I don't know why it is easier for him to tell lies than to just keep his mouth shut.  I guess he likes hearing his self make noise.    Anyhow, the rain stopped - now it is just really warm and humid.  I guess I ought to get busy and go clean stalls - just hadn't made it out of the house yet.

						   Well, this morning I did manage to get the voicemail for the nurse for our dr's office, and she called back within an hour.  I explained everything to her, and how disappointed I was by their whole handling of the situation, and she got it right.  Her name was Michelle, and she sounded disgusted and she was very professional.  But within the hour we had an appointment set up for tomorro for the boy.  Levi went and fed the horses this morning, said Rosie wasnt' quite feeling herself, and so I called the vets office - could be the west nile shot I gave her last night.  So we are hoping she gets to feeling better a little bit sooner.  Anyhow, enough for now, if the rain lets up, I will go clean stalls...

						   Had Leavy out to see Dr. Lyons last Thursday.  He said he wanted Leavy to get some bloodwork done, urine test and an ultrasound.  We got the bloodwork and urine test done immediately, and his office sent in the paperwork to River Oaks imaging to get an ultrasound scheduled.  River Oaks called back Friday to say that they had Leavy scheduled for a cat scan on Saturday.  I told them he wasn't supposed to have a cat scan, they were supposed to do an ultrasound.  They said for me to check with the dr, and get back to them - and they would reschedule whatever they had to.  At this point, I don't know if the doctor changed his orders and just didn't tell me, or if his office sent out the wrong paperwork - not a big deal either way, but I did want to be certain that he was scheduled for what the dr wanted, and so on.  So I called his office Friday, and the receptionist wouldn't let me talk to his nurse, I could only leave a message.  I gave them all day Monday to call back, and they never did reply.  I called back Tuesday, and no reply.  The husband called them about 5 times today, and they still won't let us talk to the nurse and only take messages which aren't answered.  We are getting ready to just go in tomorrow and confront them on the spot.  And in the meantime, the boy isn't hardly eating, and when he does eat, about two hours later he feels so badly that he can't sit up anymore.  He needs to go lay down.    On a much brighter note, since we started him on the pediasure and the boost juices, he is at least able to retain or create enough body heat that he doesn't go into the uncontrollable shakes at night.  Here we are in 90 degree weather and he has to go around wearing a sweatshirt most of the time.  I just worry that this is bad - and I can't get the damned dr.'s office to do something as simple as dial ten lousy numbers and just say yes or no to an ultrasound.  We gave the horses their west nile shots tonight - Rosie is so hypersensitive that she took off backing up and half rearing - I feel so bad having to give her shots especially.  Houdini didn't even seem to notice when I gave him his.

						   This morning Levi got off of the boat - 21 days gone is a long time.  Leavy and I went and fed the horses, then we ran up and picked up dad, ran back by the stable to make sure everyone had water buckets full - I got a headache, I think it was from not eating, so we stopped by a new restaurant on the way home.  Everyone here was still asleep, so we went and caught a nap too.  Went to feed the horses tonight, we cleaned out stalls, I rode both of them a few minutes, we fed then left.  We got home, and Levi was trying to fix the cable where the dog tore it out the other night (where it comes into the house).  We needed to run out to walmart to get another cable connector, and Leavy started complaining of feeling bad.  That kid has something seriously wrong with him - and I called the doctors office friday - trying to get the orders for the imaging place straight.  His office didn't call back.  I gave them a chance to call back Monday, and they didn't.  So I called them again this morning - and gee - what do you know.  They still haven't managed to call back.  I am starting to get pretty pissed about this.  Anyhow, in the meantime, we are starting him on pediasure and the boost juices - trying to get nutrition into him.  He isn't eating but a couple hundred calories a day, and apparently isn't pulling enough nutrition into his self that he can even remain warm.  On 85 degree houston days, he is wearing sweatshirts to try to keep warm.  I am really not feeling too goodly about this.  Anyhow, enough for now - back later maybe.

						   I gave myself a migraine today.  I like to get up early and feed the horses and get them out of the barn before it gets too hot. I asked the husband to call me before he went to bed, and he tried - but the baby had crawled into bed with me and was sleeping on the phone.  So when it rang, I didn't hear it.  I woke up, it looked a little brighter than it should have - I looked at the phone and it said 1140 or somethign like that.  I jumped out of bed, knowing it was already hotter than hell, and that the horses were probably out of water and sweating to death in the barn.  I was running around the house trying to get ready to leave, when I noticed the microwave clock - it was only like 700 am.  But by then, I already had a headache.  Feeding this morning was uneventful, which is always happy news.  Yesterday, I took all of the kids with me down to the barn.  I had Leavy brushing Rosie, and Rex brushing Houdini.  ( I need to change Houdini's name - it is just not him).  Anyhow, Leavy was brushing her all over, then I gave him the hair brush, and he started brushing her mane - and she just stopped eating her grain and closed her eyes and soaked it up.  I don't think I have ever seen a horse as sweet as she is.  But she just stood there and you could see her just absorbing all the attention from him that she could.  Houdini seemed pretty much indifferent to being brushed - he was too busy eating.  Anyhow, feeding tonight was pretty uneventful.  David - that has the apps got there just as I was getting ready to leave - so I stayed and talked with him a while.  He has a lot of interesting trivia - about texas history, and things like that.  I invited him to go riding with us this up coming week - and he thought that would be pretty good too.  Sherry called tonight - she was telling me that her nephew Travis died.  She was cryng hysterically - and as soon as I said that Travis had lived on borrowed time for his whole life, she just quit crying.  Real tears I can appreciate - attention whoring on someone else's tragedy I don't.  A real quick life history on Travis - he was born with pretty severe spina bifida, and his whole life has mostly been a result of hard work on his mother's behalf.  She was always at his bedside, a doting mother, and did everything that she could to give him as normal a life with as much quality of life that any human could do.  At one point, his sister who was going through nursing school wanted to take care of him, but she lived in Michigan - so they moved him up to Michigan so she could be near him.  But his mom went up there every chance she got, and every time he got sick.  He spent a lot of time in hospitals - and it was a heck of a struggle for life everytime he was in there.  She was truly a good mother to him - hell she was a good mother to all of her children.  But on the Sherry thing - everytime her sister had a family emergency, Sherry would be out there carrying on like it was her personal tragedy and it wasn't.  But when it was Sherry's personal tragedy( like both of her daughters getting hysterectomies) she was pretty tight lipped, instead of calling everyone in the country, like she did when something happened in her sister's family.  I got pretty brusque with her, and finally she found a reason to get off of the phone.  Well - enough depressing talk for now.  I am goign to close this up and try to get some rest.

						   Today was the busy day.  Check was in the bank, had to pay bills, then out to the stables to pay board, then up to the vets to pick up everyone's west nile shots, then to run general errands.  I was at walmart two times today.  How much more screwed up can things get?!?!  Sherry came by, miscontrued what Rex had to say then blew up at him.  She didn't get a promotion at work, was passed up on it by an 18 year old boy straight out of high school.  Was on the thin skinned side of things and was nearly in tears when she spotted me and followed me home.  At least she wasn't watching us from down the road like she did last time.  anyhow, lightening was striking all around, driving rain - horses didn't want to face into the rain, rosie tried to back to the barn so she could get her dinner without her face getting any wetter than it was, took Levi to go do boat groceries - and it is now 3:10 am and I am tired.  I have been up since 7 this morning and didn't get my nap - and I am dead tired.  I already know I am going to hate getting up in the morning - even thought of going and turning the horses out right now, so I could sleep in tomorrow...  Not going to do that though...  night...

						   Leavy has been pretty bad sick for a while.  When we went to get him from Pennsylvania, he couldn't hold anything down, not sodas, not food - not anythign at all.  And worse than that, he just wouldn't eat.  He would eat a portion that was suitable for a bird, then quit.  Then after he ate, he would keep asking if he was going to be sick during the evening, and almost be frantic in his asking.  But last month he went in to see the dr, and they gave him a meds and said that if it didn't clear up to bring him back.  Well, he has been getting progressively worse, so he went back in today.  Today they put him in for blood and urine tests, and scheduled him for an ultrasound.  So three days after the ultrasound he goes back in.  anyhow, I need to digest,then I need to go clean stalls...

						   I went to feed last night, had to fight with a few others horses to get mine into the barn.  Once I got Rosie and the gelding in, we just fed them - and hung around a while until they were done with their grain and then make sure they drank all they could before filling their water buckets for the night.  When I went this morning and fed, about the time I went to turn them loose, Dave that has the apps in the field came out.  He was getting ready to trim his horses, after he fed them.  He was telling me some of the better places to ride, and suggested that we go riding one day.  There is a mare with a colt at the pasture - I think he threw her some hay.  Her owner left the property once, then brought them back - she isn't feeding the mare anything, only letting her graze.  And the mare is losing weight badly.  A week ago, her backbone was a little bit visible, today the top of her rib cage is starting to show and you can start to see her ribs.  No doubt a week from now she will be exceptionally poor.  There really isn't enough feed on the pasture for the horses to subsist on grazing exclusively, and all the fat horses out there are being fed twice a day.  There are a few that are on pasture exclusively, and while they are dropping a little bit of weight, it isn't as bad as a mare nursing a baby.  I wished I could find who she belongs to, so I could volunteer to start graining her - but there is a standing rule at the stable (we had to sign off on this) to not feed other peoples horses.  So I can't do it without written permission.  The baby is up and active - and Leavy has spent the morning on the computer looking at lamborghinis, as if we could afford one of those...  :).    anyhow, enough for the moment - I need to make lunch.

						   Tonight when I went out to feed, I was trying to lead Maxi out to the little pen behind the barn - and she stepped on my foot.&nbsp; Now up until now, I thought her big pan sized feet were a problem - but I think those big flat feet are the reason I only have one fracture and not a whole mess of shattered bones...&nbsp; Stupid of me to be leading her with flip flops on.  Wormed Rosie and Houdini tonight...&nbsp; so that is out of the way.  nuff for now, the foot is burning.

						   Tonight when I got to the pasture, the tacketts were there.&nbsp; They had two of their horses in stalls, and then they had their yearling in the little open area, because no stalls were available for her.&nbsp; So she was eating in the open area, I brought my horses in, fed them, pulled Maxi's feed bowl up near the fence, fed her, and went out to smoke a cigarrette.&nbsp; After the tackett's filly got done eating, she started nosing towards where Maxi was, and Maxi pinned her ears back and took bite at her - and the filly took off down the breezeway of the barn.&nbsp; The tackett's son ran from behind their car which was in the pasture, got up to Maxi who was eating at that time, and started beating her about the head and neck.&nbsp; I hollered "no - you don't hit her" and he started screaming at me "I will hit her if she bites my horse".&nbsp; Well, Maxi never actually bit the tackett's filly.&nbsp; I told him again "you don't fucking hit any horse but your own" and he started screaming "I will hit any horse that bites one of mine".&nbsp; His mother started on him, and he got loud with her, and finally she made him sit in the truck.&nbsp; But then she started threatening me with telling John that I was feeding the horse, and that "he would scatter my horses all over Houston".&nbsp; Kind of burst her bubble when I told her that I talked to John about it before I ever fed her the first bite.   It would be one thing if their horse didn't do anything bad - but I have almost been kicked by their horse when he was kicking at my horse, and their horse has bit my horse, right when I was leading him.&nbsp; I nearly got run over in the process.  Day before yesterday, the tackett husband and boy showed up to feed - and while the other horses were eating, they went out to where Laird and I was, and started jacking with Karla's filly.&nbsp; John (the tackett husband) would mess with teh filly, and she would turn her butt to him and act like she was thinking about kicking - and he woudl jump out of the way.&nbsp; When she would just be walking by a few minutes later, he would reach out and smack her on the rump.&nbsp; Then he would start teasing her again.&nbsp; And this went on for a while.&nbsp; I think it is a lot of the reason that she is thinking right now that she is even justified in kicking.  I am goign to talk to the boy again tomorrow, and explain to him that it isn't nice to be hitting the horse, and try to explain to him that just as he wouldnt' want to see his horse hit, that no other horse deserves to be hit either.&nbsp; Horses just establish a pecking order, and that once established they learn to keep a clear path of each other.&nbsp; I just hope he learns something from it - if not, I am going to remove our horses from the field.&nbsp; I will not let my horses be smacked around by tobacco spittin' white trash, who can't manage to feed their horses but maybe one day in 5.   nuff for now...

						   When I hit the neighbors car, grandpa very generously offered to help me with it - when I paid them 200 bucks the other day, then told him I could use his help now, he exclaimed "I didn't mean I was going to pay for it" and then he continued on to tell me what a wonderful thing I had done and how much it was goign to save me on my insurance.&nbsp; Kewl.&nbsp; The insurance company said that they don't raise your rates unless the accident runs more than 500 bucks.&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; Oh well, that is the evil grandpa for you.  Today I was out feeding, fed Karla's horse and when they got done eating, her filly came up to me.&nbsp; I let her smell my hand, and when she realized I didn't have a goody in it for her, the little snot pinned her ears back and swung her butt around, and acted like she was goign to kick me.&nbsp; I have reached the point that I call her little stinky.&nbsp; Karla calls her black velvet, everyone else calls her baby - but to me she is little stinky.&nbsp; Bad baby!&nbsp; :)  Leavy had a hard time eating his pill tonight, it stuck in his throat and burned him.&nbsp; The pharmacist said there was nothing in it that should have burned - but he said it did.&nbsp; He kept coughing for a long time after, so I kind of suspect that something burned him.  Anyhow, all in all - every thing is going good.&nbsp; The horses all had their gumdrops tonight.

						   Yesterday we went up to centerville, and transferred the property from Levi's name to my dad's name.&nbsp; We put Grandma's name on it too - but I am afraid that before we get a chance to probate Grandma's will, that grandpa will find a way to put it in his name only.&nbsp; He is kind of greedy and grabby that way. &nbsp; It was hot, breezeless and miserable at the cabin yesterday.&nbsp; But we brought back another load of stuff - kid's movies, some furniture, and stuff like that.&nbsp; We had been having problems trying to get the Melcers&nbsp; to remove their cows for the past several months, and when we got there, there were no cows on the place so when we left we locked the front and back gates to the place.&nbsp; Just as Levi was putting the gate up (it had been knocked over and the cows allowed to walk over it) a bull was walking over in the direction of the gate, and looked kind of puzzled over the gate shutting.&nbsp; I am awfully glad that we got that gate put back up before he made it in there - we didn't have any grain or anything to persuade him back out of the place with.&nbsp; We do need to make at least one more trip up there - mostly to get garbage out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a multitude of cloth items like clothes and bedsheets that were ruined by mice and stuff - a lot of paper goods that were chewed up leaving the little bits of paper that mice usually do.&nbsp; So we need to go back up there and finish cleaning it up - I told grandpa that we would go up there in the fall when it cooled off some, but he said he wasn't in any great hurry about it.&nbsp; I think we had heat indexes in the 110's yesterday - not ideal weather to be doing heavy moving in. &nbsp; Leavy is finally taking his medicine and feeling better.&nbsp; He has started eating some again, and is feeling like going out and doing something - and I am so glad.&nbsp; He wants to go out and use his new saddle today, which I am just so thankful that he is actually feeling like doing some kind of activity right now. &nbsp; nuff for now, I am thinking about crawling back into bed.&nbsp; I am still tired...

						   We spend the morning working on the horses' stalls - we kept seeing these great big ugly spiders, on the rafters, and the fence posts in the stalls.  Levi sprayed them with regular can spray, kitchen spray for flying bugs and spiders.  Didn't kill them.  As a matter of fact, after he had dosed them so liberally that they were dripping spray off of them, they still kept staggering around.  We got home and I looked them up on hte internet - male black widow spiders.  tons of them.  Yech.

						   Last night I gave the horses their second west nile shot.  Also - day before yesterday (the 10th) I gave the horses first dose of the ivomec wormer - need to do it again in two weeks, then again two weeks after that.  That should kill all stages of most worms.  Maybe that will fatten them up a little bit...

						   I think I have just about had it with fark chat.  I was in there yesterday when some sorry little shrewish gal got her jollies out of making fun of and belittling some 18 year old boy that was working and going to college, because he didn't have a state of the art cutting edge computer.  Just some sorry little mousy bitch.  I got after her a bit - but realized that these kind of people are not the kind of people I choose to associate with, and I believe I am going to cancel my tf account on account of it.  But I am embarrassed to even be in the same species at a person that would act that way.  I just feel so bad for the young man that she was ragging on - and she didn't even have her facts straight.  She claimed he was whining because of this or that - and in reality all he did was ask what a dialer was.  She is a prime example of why abortion needs to be legal.  I have been sick the past week.  I think it is my heart.  The last time I got like this was when I prolapsed my heart valve, and no one either seems to believe it or care.  That is ok - I have been tired of life for a while now.  Leavy is still sick.  The other night Levi got after him for not eating, and even after Leavy started crying he kept it up.  I have been kind of fighting with him ever since - I don't even want to look at his face at his point.  I tried to talk to him, and he just kind of denies that he did what he did.  That is kewl - we just won't talk, or associate with each other until he acknowledges what he did, and agrees not to pursue that kind of behavior.  Leavy isnt eating because not eating is fun - he has real physical pain and he hurts.  He can't even go in a car ride across town without having severe physical pain.

						   Yesterday I had Leavy to the ped gi - he said that it sounds like it could be irritable bowel syndrome - so he gave him meds for that.  He also said that it could be giardia after hearing that he was drinking from mountain streams - and scheduled some tests for stool samples and what have you.  At this point, we are waiting for Leavy to eat something so he can try the medicine.  The dr said that they really can't test of ibs, but that if it responds to medicine, then that would be that.    I did my running yesterday.  I am reaching the point that I am so weak, I think my heart is messing up again.  I just feel like I am fading, and all I want to do is sleep.  I told the kids yesterday that if were living in africa, I would think that I had gotten bitten by a tsetse fly - and have sleeping sickness.  But I know a little better than that.  There was an issue when I was havign the baby that my heart had become enlarged, and I think that is contributing to some of what I am feeling now.  I took David from the stable with me to do my running yesterday - was worried that if I got on the far side of town and couldn't drive back, I would need someone that could drive the truck for me with me.  He was a good sport about it - and I really appreciated it a lot.  nuff for now, I find it nearly unbearable to move even my fingers, I just feel so wore out.

						   this is just one of those hot lazy summer houston mornings.  There are things that need to be done outside - but I just don't see them happening today.  I wished I could get an earlier start on a lot of these - but I can get rex up to watch the baby so I can do the things I need to do.    Oh well - tomorrow is Leavy's dr day, and we will get him to a ped gi right away.  I hope they can get that kid eating again - he is in pretty bad shape.  nuff for now, I need to chase the baby

						   Yesterday when Leavy got up, he was so weak that he was staggering when he walked, and just really didn't seem with it.  I tried to contact the ped gi, and they said he wouldn't be back until tuesday.  Finally - worried that he wouldn't live long enough to see the ped gi, I took him to the hospital - we ran around and got his lab results and what have you first so they could see what was found so far, and finally got to the hospital about 4:30.  When they finally got him into a room,they started an iv, infiltrated the vein, refused to acknowledge the mottling of the skin on his hand as the fluids built up in his hand.  He moved his hand so it was the highest part on his arm, and when they finally removed it, he couldn't move his shoulder area.  But once again, they claimed it wasn't infiltrated, they just said he was picking up on my queues.  Personally I think that is the excuse of those that are deficient of skills in the medical field to cover their screw ups.  By the way folks - that is clear lake regional hospital.  didn't get to feed the horses last night - we got in around midnight and it was too late to go feed them.

						   Yesterday, Levi got off of the boat, and as soon as he got home, he mowed the lawn.  When he got done, we went to feed the horses and as we were leaving the stable, we got a call that Dell had cut herself.  So we rushed up to crosby to meet the vet for stitches on her, and by the time we got home we were too tired to move.  I have been corresponding with Sherry's daughter about her - and today I called Sherry to try to set stuff straight with her.  She started trying to change all the facts of things that have happened - anyhow, long story short I am goign to go pick up diamond in the next day or so.  So I no longer have to worry about what is happening with him and if he has lost anymore weight - or anything.  Laird and his son are really interested in him - and I know that Laird will take good care of him.   I am seriously thinking about breeding Rosie to a paint stud.  He is out of a heck of a nice horse, and would probably go about 15 hands and 1000 lbs right now - but he is only 2 years old - with it being this time of hte year, probably about 2 1/2.  Good looking meaty kid...    Between her size and his breadth, I think/hope I can get a nice big standup horse out of them...  anyhow, nuff for now - I need to get a few things done...
