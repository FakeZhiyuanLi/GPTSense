      My first blog, my first post. i'm starting this all by myself, so this'll be kinda messy.   My name's Jonathan. i live in the most  boring  place on earth, Singapore.   I had an argument with a friend on tuesday night. kinda guilty and sorry i cracked, and i will apologise to him when i get the chance.  I also pang-seh-ed Quek for watching a movie. Geez, i was in a lousi mood after losing to someone in Initial D.   I'm starting to suck in Initial D. i'm simply too far from the best. There was this guy using a level 17 FD Spirit, racing this level 13 Evo6 user. I wasn't really paying attention (was juz looking at his lvl 17 aura. BIG) but i think the FD challenged the Evo6 on Irohazaka and won. sorri for the ppl who have no idea what i'm talking abt.  I want to be a drummer in a nice, ambient pub. there'll be a really good clarinetist and a really good saxophonist, along with a really good pianist in a four-piece band, and we'll play jazz and swing and stuff like that.   The feeling after you play a song well, and you KNOW you played it well, is BLISS.   Played pool till about 3am. Classic pool is a nice place to play. it's just sad my concentration is lost in about one hr into the game, and i juz kinda space out. I was looking at the Grand Prix showing on TV. not sure where it was held, but the camera from the driver's view was "wah kaoz DAT's FAST". The bill (for pool) was kinda ex though.  I got lots of shit to talk about, bear with me. I somehow don't seem to talk enough when i'm with my friends though.  Must...Talk...More...Cock...  I really like my girl alot. She's this cute and bubbly girl that just brightens up my day when i hear her voice. I don't seem to spend enough time with her. Or talk enough to her. Her friends though... are interesting, to say the least. I think i have gotten off on the wrong foot(that's an idiom)with her best friend's father. Wasn't my fault, i cant stand a stranger scolding me. so well i fucking scolded back. i hope he's not too mad about it though.  Must...Restrain...More...   Roald Dahl  is good. His works often bring unrealistic situations in very realistic situations. Thinking that way in real life is not advisable, In My Honest Opinion (IMHO).My English teacher in Sec2 told me to read something, which i have not read till this very day. I think its something call "The Chemist".   Next, some nonsense.  When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead, And the White Knight is talking backwards And the Red Queen's "off with her head" And Remember what the doormouse said: "Feed your head. Feed your head."  taken from the last verses of the song  White Rabbit  by  Jefferson Airplane . i havent heard the song though, will d/l it. Speaking of songs,  System Of A Down's Toxicity  is freaking nice.   And now, the lyrics from  Wind , by  Akeboshi . No, no, don't read it yet. Open   and d/l it NOW. And sing along.  Cultivate your hunger before you idealize. Motivate your anger to make them all realize. Climbing the mountain, never coming down. Break into the contents, never falling down.  My knee is still shaking, like I was twelve, Sneaking out of the classroom, by the back door. A man railed at me twice though, but I didn't care. Waiting is wasting for people like me.  Don't try to live so wise. Don't cry 'cause you're so right. Don't dry with fakes or fears, 'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.  You say, "Dreams are dreams. "I ain't gonna play the fool anymore." You say, "'Cause I still got my soul."  Take your time, baby, your blood needs slowing down. Breach your soul to reach yourself before you gloom. Reflection of fear makes shadows of nothing, shadows of nothing.  You still are blind, if you see a winding road, 'Cause there's always a straight way to the point you see.  Don't try to live so wise. Don't cry 'cause you're so right. Don't dry with fakes or fears, 'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.  This song is the first ending song for  Naruto . Full of insight, if you grasp the meanings behind the lyrics. The english pronunciation is NOT good at all, however it is a credible attempt for a japanese. Even more impressive, if you take into account that he wrote the lyrics and composed this song himself.   Anime is GOOOD.   I feel like cycling. I guess tomorrow at sunset. Cycling while listening to  Jay Chou  is relaxing.   Sometimes, i feel like i'm just a log, in the middle of the bright blue ocean. i drift around some distance, i feel it, but its such a miniscule amount compared to the ocean's sheer size. Cliche, but oh so true.  During the times during sec 1 and/or 2 i used to take the really early bus to school. The bus would arrive at like, 5.50am, and i would reach school at 6.20am(school starts at 7.15. i really wondered what i was doing back then). The journey to school in the bus was really, really brooding and depressing. it was before the TVMobile broadcasting hrs start (it starts at 6.30am), so the speakers would play some really sad and mysterious music, of which i will never find out the title of any song. Really enjoyable.   Somehow i am thinking of the Australia Trip i had back in December. I liked some parts of the trip, really hated some parts. i really wished for Mama or Lychee to come. oh well, they had their fun in Cambodia, along with AhDog, Monkey, Bui^Gia, Gay(Ryo. wahaha) and Lucky. LOTS of photos of their trip. The stars in Australia at night were bright and twinkly (Orion's belt..), unlike the sky in Singapore. Here, its dark and non-starry. ITS BORING IN SINGAPORE. i will not forget the bus rides on the farm. That crazy driver actually jumped the old bus (Magic School Bus-model type. -_-)  with like, 40+ people in it. Oh yeah, fantastic.  I started to blog at 3.24am. it is now 5.25am. lol.  Seeya

      It seems that Hitler took   urlLink amphetamines   daily. no wonder he is so... eccentric? the title of my history textbook is "Modern World History". it should be titled "Wars of the 20th Century" instead. the chapters were focused on the two World Wars, and some stuff i cant remember. i'm not too good in my studies, so wad? sue me? well anyway, my History(War Stories) teacher never failed to tell us the one thing that the textbook did not seem to stress enough. WAR IS WRONG, HUMANITY IS EVIL IN ITS ROOTS. allrite so she didnt say the last part of the sentence, but she sure sounded like it. she also had a morbid fascination with Hitler, and the Nazis. Ahem, SShhhhhh... Big Bro P.A.P is watching....  Initial D. THE GAME. this game ate... $300(still not sure, don't dare to count actually!) of my MOOLAH since i started. Well spent, IMHO. although Mama is someone i aspire to reach, i now know my limits. Sadded! but the feeling of KICKING someone's ASS on AKAGI UPHILL... OOOHHHH..... thanks to this game, i find out that gaming culture is alive and kicking in Singapore. More on this, i dunt feel like talking about it now.  Speaking of   urlLink gaming culture  ... Japan is a country where culture is very extremely rooted in the daily life of its inhabitants. that's in my opinion however, because i have read and have heard of the "degeneration" of Japanese culture. However, my exposure to Japan (which most recently is anime, but last time i kinda visited Japan quite frequently for the school holidays) is just what i said in the second sentence. A culture focused on politeness, ettiqueite (how the $#@# you spell it), and self-grooming(is that a real word?). Lots of shit i talk now. lol    urlLink She's    Mogi. not too bad.  Edison Chen's  Takumi. WAD THE FUCK???  Jay Chou  is gonna be Takashi Ryosuke. pls pls pls!!!   Back to my life. You people think i don't have one right? well yessss i do. Lemme see... Monkey woke mi up, he wanted to play Need for Speed Underground. A really good game, although the physics are kind of unrealistic... he played till he CARSICK. nonsensical, to get carsick when he blardy hell isnt even in a car.. just playing a game only. hahaha!   I wanted to meet my girl after that... she had bowling practise. Unfortunately she wanted to go home, and i juz went to BuiGia's house. VERY BORING it was there. I just sat around and we ordered pizza and we ate. the new tuna pizza was kinda good, but my first bite into the hawaiian was like "OOH YEAH!". maybe i didn't eat pizza properly for the first time in a long time...   FLASHBACK! for my girl's birthday about a week back she, a few of her friends and i went to TM Pizza Hut to eat. i wont bother to type much, but i can safely say we left the tables like a WARZONE. hohoho.  Back to BuiGia's hse. oh yeah i watched american idol. i dunt hate it much, i'm actually kinda impressed at how Kelly Clarkson and Clay Ailken and Ruben Studdard got more and more "star-like". i duno if you will get what i mean though.    Did some totally boring stuff ( i was kinda spaced out, as usual you'll have noticed by now ) and wad i did remember was to catch the last bus home. And so i am here now.. posting... allrite so i dunt have a life! =(  Songs Songs Songs.  Dogfight  by  Move  is R0X0r.  Eminem  is good when you've had an argument with a fucking retard, and fucking wanna scold some shit at someone.   all right i'm starting to lose steam here. dunwanna post no more. its 2:16 now, i started posting dunno when...  Peace

      I managed to stay at home for 24 hrs!!!!   Thank you thank you... Such a major achievement!! I think i didn't stay at home for 24 hrs for like... 3 months? i meant the 'extended boring version'.. like REALLY STUCK at home. yeah i was. craziness and very brainwashing. but yeah, what can i do when i need to save money... (saving for what? i'm not sure myself really!)  okay, so i didn't really stay in for 24 hrs straight...  I succumbed to alternate homesickness at 8pm. I decided i would lend my cousin's bike and go to the beach for a while. Nice.. Windy... there's this section of East Coast Park, before the Bedok Jetty and all the way till before the place with the short trees. When you go to that section, the whole air is just sooooooooo cool and easy to breathe... You'll know what i talk about when you go there and cycle or jog personally. However, i onli experienced it during early morning and night. i guess the afternoon's too hot...   Listening to Initial D eurobeat tracks makes me get a headache. On another note, I almost crashed into two people. One was a small kid who was roller-blading, when he juz kinda lost control and swerved into my direction. I had an easy time dodging. The other guy whom i almost crashed into wanted to cross the road, but had no confidence that he'll make it. So he decided to stand like a fucking stone in the centre of the road. I was expecting him to cross, but NOOOOO he didn't, making me brake right in his fucking face. Kaoz. Nvm i'm not too pissed...  After that, i came back... around 9pm. It was gonna rain, so i decided to get back sooner. watched some show called The Dead Zone. A very interesting show. This guy (shit i forgot the name) can see the future. GYAAAH i'm lazy to type this out. For those who watched that show, its cool ain't it? For those who haven't, watch it cos its one of the few INTELLIGENT shows on tv.  Erm, after that i started to read a book about  urlLink  Confucius  . He is the man. Trying to learn a few pointers from what i've read... >.   A Gentleman has Nine Points to Ponder...   When looking, he must think of seeing clearly. When listening, he must think of hearing clearly. When expressing moods, he must appear amicable. Behave in a courteous manner. When speaking, he must first think of honesty. When working, he must think of putting in his best. When in doubt, he must think of questioning. When angry, he must think of the consequences. When a benefit is upon him, he must ponder if he deserves it.   That are nine tough rules.  P.S. I love my girl.

      I think i sabo-ed someone. Without intention to.   Me and my big mouth.  I'd like to say no matter how i say and complain, the fact that i still complain means i still do acknowledge that someone. And when i do, that means usually the argument (or misunderstanding or wadever) will work out.   when i don't acknowledge someone, i usually will never ever talk to them again.  I really really sometimes really really wish i can go back back back and right some wrongs.   Since the wrongs will be forever scarred onto me. Wif constant reminders as i try to forget. And when i try to act something, try to be helpful, i'll end up messing it up.  Sad reality is that i'm a useless loser.   Struggle, Jon... Struggle............  On another related-not-so-closely note, a close friend of mine broke up. i'm not sure how she's dealing with it... but she's dealing with lots of stuff other than that... i really very look up to her... cos she's got lots of willpower and she works hard for what she wans, and she knows she will get it.   but she thinks alot.. she plans alot... she doesnt go wif the flow u noe? -_-  Allrite so she has her bad side too... her bf criteria... is like a textbook long. she really badmouths ppl sometimes. she really looks down on ppl sometime,s but she got liang xing one later she will regret. -_-  I've also got another close friend... i must admit i was an idiot in front of him... a real idiot... and even sometimes now.. i seem to do stupid things in front of him. i dun't know why... den he'll go all sour... and i know its my fault and i feel shitty.   the fact that he still counts me as a close friend..   however, he is a possessive boyfriend. i think he's really in control of his life and thus, this attitude unwittingly and unintentionally towards his girlfriend too.   i will point out he really treats his girlfriend very extremely well. thus he expects the same out of her. i wont go into background. i must say that no matter how close someone is to you, that someone still needs space to breathe.  Ah.. this blog shall remain as private as i can try it to be. As you can see, consequences if this leaks out may be dire. However, i do have everyone's well-being at heart...  Now back to reality. tommorow i gotta meet him, but i really fucking lazy to go. i will try to wake up at 10, though.  Maybe i shld put the bad comments first, then the good comments? cos if you read a glowing article that degenerates into a bad one, you'll naturally get angry right? But if its the other way round, the person will think the other way round rite? hmmz....  Ah, fuck it.    Confucius said :   "Without steadfastness, the gentleman would not command respect, and his learning will not be sound. Advocating trustworthiness and loyalty, he has no friend or peer who is not his equal. He would not hesitate to correct his faults."  2:42AM.

      A day and night out. i went out at 3pm yesterday. i came back at 7am. Geeez.... tiring...  the last Initial D qualifying rounds today at Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. too freaking hard to qualify... 2"50"1xx the "worst" time to beat. TOO HARD!   I play Initial D so much, i wonder why i dunt have a dream car. Nothing has come along and knocked me off my feet yet.  I beat Bunta 2 stars though... not too bad lah... okay so there's so many ppl more better then me. sadded.  on the other hand, i went to play at XSquare. i guess my Soul Caliber 2 is not too bad... can beat most of my friends more than they beat me. Lolz SPAWN is GOOD! Mitsurugi is also good! so is Kinik (or whatever its name is).   To Zanarkand is HARD. VERY HARD!!!!!! Grade 8... =( managed to play the right hand part (w/o the accompaniment left hand you know?) thru till the semi-demi quavers.. GYAAHHHHHHH!  Shit that friend of mine. I really dun't wanna argue and all that. haiz i dunno. Maybe my mental capacity is really up to here. Sadded then. NO!!! i will not yield!!! i will try to increase mental sharpness.   purposely being an idiot in front of them is a stupid thing to do. Laughing at idiocy is evil. i really very fake in front of him and i really very stupid in front of him. that's how i am. maybe i shall stay away from him liao. cos although our interests are the same, the way we appreciate it is not.    Confucius  said:  "Do not be concerned about others not appreciating you. Be concerned about your not appreciating others."  Some light shone to my small insignificant mind...  Alright so i'll not care about him belittling me.. I'll care about other's good points...   Didn't manage to meet my girl. ARGH VERY THE FRUSTRATING. She's over in TM and i'm in PS.. wad the hell lohz... da bai nv see her... miss her...   Security (The Lack Of It) Issues abound. i really know i'm not doing enough to keep this relationship. But i'm really feeling from the bottom of my heart that i wouldn't want anyone else in the world but her to be my girlfriend.   I gotta shop for clothes liao... i also gotta save money.   my life... really a speck in the whole wide world...  8.12am.

      First post in 10 days... or 11?  Many things happened... or did nothing happen at all?  Didn't spent a cent today!!! so proud of myself.. >.  The clock in my living room is TICKING and TICKING so LOUDLY. Irritating.  Ayumi Hamasaki's songs make good listening. I wont say anything about her 'live' ability, or the astounding numbers of remixes, videos, singles and other what-have-you's to milk the money out of her, that fat cash cow. I get her songs online, so there. =X  Initial D : Arcade Stage Version 3. Bunta Challenge on the map Irohazaka; I gotta 8 stars!!!!!! My target : 10, to at least see the BuntaCar... I've got this inferior complex to Bunta. Dunno why... he just freaks me out. Well... MORE STARS ON MY CARD!!! I also finally managed to chase up to my 2'32 on Akagi up. hehehehehehehehehehehehehehe of course there's lots of improvement.  I also have a nagging feeling in my heart. About my girl... geez... i don't know... like quek said... "just a damn kid..." She's sweet, she's polite(not to everybody but well yeah), she's pretty, she's cute, she's tactful, she's smart, she's kind. I know there isn't another gerl out there in the whole wide world that appeals to me. Why then, you will ask. Why then, you're unsure of yourself? Well here comes... She's only just turned 14 a month ago. I am 16, 5 months to 17.  Dunno how larh... we like each other, yeah... the age difference nags me... cos my friends will say, "wad? sec 2 ONLI?" It gets to me larh... Sad.  But I love her.   I shall also say to you assholes who ask mi "wad stage liao arh? ^_~" I and her have NOT done anything. You pervertic assholes all of you.   Lackadaisical...... i like that word. Read it up. You'll find that it describes me pretty well. Although "Slacking around being lifeless like a fucking zombie" fits me pretty well too.  A random thought : Ah_Dog still hasn't gotten over Sasa. Haiz...He said he's not gonna get a girlfriend till after his degree... Well yeah, I'll support his decision.  I'm listening to Duke Nukem's Theme by MegaDeth. ROXOR! well MegaDeth sounds like a typical hardcore band to me. so i won't bother to d/l any of their music.  I'm an absent-minded bastard. Pass the ginko nuts!  Haiz lazy to type liao.

      Hmmmm... this will be a confessional blogpost.   I'm sorry.  I haven't done my best to everyone.    urlLink Monkey   has posted a really touching testimonial for me on  urlLink friendster . Of course, there are other really touching testimonials that have been written for me... But Monkey, the one whom i suan (insult) most of the time, has written a serious one. so i resolved to myself... i shall not treat monkey like an ass (although he behaves like one sometimes mwahahha). Bah, you have launched me into this sentimental mood that has sent me thinking about stuff... and i realise i dunt appreciate my friends enough...   i have a point of argument in here though. To be honest, just a really few (really really few) frens i have confided in... I'll name just one, Juriana, cos i feel she is deserves to be named. she's just a being of goodness...   However, its my fault, since i usually dunt say anithing. Well... i'm sorry for that... But i feel that i shld keep private matters to myself. >.  I love my parents, whom i dunt really talk to all the time. I feel that i was not brought up by them... because i remember growing up in my grandmother's house... with a really scary auntie who terrorised me. Not the crazy auntie, another auntie. All my parents did for me last time... i forgot already... maybe i didn't remember... All i know is that now, my parents provide for me financially, and provide me with a house to stay. So i shall get a job, and provide for them when i get one.  Cocked up, aren't I?  To Juriana... Thank God for this angel on earth.  To Princess Tomato... we were good friends for a period... you symbolise the ultimate success woman to me. In everything. The only flaw in you is your tendency to crumble under stress. i wish i could actively help.. but you have enough friends that are 100 times better than me who will help you. Go on and succeed in life, and prove me right.  To Quek... i'm always looking stupid and dumb and cant be bothered to you... cos you are smart and tactful so i can't get back at you! You chose your path in life yourself, i hope you've accepted it...   To Ah_dog, Gay, Monkey, and Mama... you guys i've known since sec 1, knew each other better in sec 2... i know i've been stupid and idiotic and a jerk for most of the time.. thanks for bearing with me. Especially Mama.  To Bui_Gia... i known you onli from a little way into the year when we were in sec 3... became close cos you were very friendly, and were close wif the grp of frens i was close to (above paragraph the people lar). However in this short period of time you've been a blast. Given me a different perspective on how to deal with life. I know you've been through a few rough patches in here. I just hope things turned out the best possible way they can be.   To Lychee... We knew each other since... not too sure. You and I, i admit, aren't too close... i dun't know why. i think you have your fair share of confidants... But i'll say that when there's anything up that requires my help, i'll help. You'll be successful in life, thats for sure.   To Levis... We've known each other very recently onli. Your views on life and mine differ greatly... Hope you're doing well in USA. Just pay Lychee a bit more attention...  To Raven... I owe you 3 million and 65 dollars. I'll pay them back when i become a billionaire.   To Yip Teng... You're a great friend i've known for since primary one to sec 4... 10 years... Wow... we've changed alot hor?   To my primary sch frens... You guys rock.  To piggy jie... we dunt talk much liao... but i hope you will do well in your A's! Den when you free, lez go eat eat ok? >.  Last but not least, to the girl who i love... You are really perfect. You are everything good in the world bundled and wrapped up. I'm just really nervous around you sometimes.  To all my friends (if i nv name you, too bad larh... its onli mi, a noname nonsensical slacker wad, no big deal rite?), who've been there for me, and who've just accompanied me and cheered me up without knowing it, thanks guys (and gals).  I know there are some posts i made here in this blog that are 'controversial', but i cannot lie. Thus, scold me if you want.   However, I shall say it now that every one of you have inspired me in little different ways.   All right enough with the mushy stuff.    DOVES OF PEACE AWAY!

Everything intact, especially my initial D cards. those bastards who stole my wallet don't know value when they see it! kekekekekekekekeke! Thanks to Joanne who called me... _ _""  That day.. when was it? Tuesday? Monday??? nono yesterday... Tuesday!!! I was just about to make my IC again somemore... luckily i slacked, and just nice when i was about to go out and get my IC done when Joanne called me and told me my wallet had been found. lolx. so i saved $100 of my parents' money... too bad my girl's purse cannot find... haizzzzz... she's got a brand new 8250... my daughter say so touching get same old phone as mine, but i'm thinking... REALLY MEH SHE WILL GET THE SAME FONE AS ME?!?!?!?! I VERY TOUCHED LEH LIKE DAT!!!! T_T"  Well, so i went to collect the damned wallet along with my cousin, and after that we went to play some InitialD... He chose the BNR32. Well not too bad car... only the 3rd suckiest of the lot.. as quoted by Mama:"the pick up is 3rd from bottom...after tureno 86 and cappu"... haha.. however, its strong in wet conditions. thus , as quoted by Mama :" A must for wet specialists". Well i told my cousin to juz work on technique, can choose a car another time... And well he's addicted!! he wanted to play at arnd 830pm, but i was kinda lazy (and wanted to save up for stuff) so i didnt wanna go. so he didn't. Well, helped him (and me) save $10 tonight. hahaha  Saw my primary sch fren at the beach 2day cycling with her present classmates. she turning more and more chio siah. unfortunately she also got more and more pimples.. =X =X =X Why was i at the beach you ask? well quek ask me out go cycle lorh... she so lazy in the end cycle so slow >.  We cycled for abit, along with Cass who came later. Talked about children. >.  Random Note: urlLink Howie Day  is someone i kinda envy. Hansem, young, talented with the guitar, can sing. Stylo siaaaah. Too bad, seems he's not what he seems. Got jailed for something or other.  Hmmmm. i wanna go Cleo's hse for jamming! but i dunt think its possible anymore... I still owe my girl a lesson on drums too. =/  I wanna learn howto roller blade.   I wanna play drums so fucking well, Travis of Blink182 will worship me (cos now, its the other way round.)  Worthless track i'm gonna recommend and you're not gonna listen to anyway : Remember Me by Leslie Parrish.   Leslie. hmmm... doesn't sound too nice. =X  Rise of Nations is NICEEEEE. Mainly cos i can kick the fucking comp's ass and use half my remaining force to clear its bases on tough difficulty. Haven't tried tougher or toughest difficulty yet though.  Rufio. Not sure whether its a band, or he's a singer, but Rufio plays some emo/semi punkrock/pop and some of his/their songs are not too bad.   Shit i'm running out of things to say.   Fuck you, i'm off to slack.

      it has been studied that 'bright' people (more alert and sharp than others) make use of "bright sparks" in their brain.   Tis true. Look it up d00ds.   Booze is good.  how the hell did i get 100+ hits already? i didn't do nothing!!!    its the internet.. some webbies get 100 hits in a MINUTE. DUH.   I wonder... if i will ever get to seriously settling down and learning some good drums in the future...   I saw a band playing thru a window, thru my bus window, as i was going back from P.S last nite. aahhh, it was a 4 piece band playing classical quartet music. i could feel the class oozing just from the window. And in the adjacent window, you could see the bar, wif da bartender mixing good alcohol, and all those bottles in the background. Imagine the atmosphere in the bar.. everyone chatting and smiling and drinking good stuff and the sound of glasses clinking and the band would play a nice, upbeat melodic piece... and when they finish everyone would stand and clap and toast them. good clean classy fun.. aaahhh the CLASS....................   Maybe when i'm 50.  I wont mind playing the bass...   Of course.. i expect my polytechnic to be a hectic and busy life, even though ppl say its gonna be slack. Cos i wanna excel in it.  I guess i'll find the time. i swear i'll find time for my girl too. she's so cute omg.  Geez... Booze, extreme fatigue or extreme depression are the factors for me to ramble and ramble.  That's baaaaad. What the hell, i'll sleep it through anyway.   Reminiscing about old times... Primary Two... Primary 3... Primary 4... Primary 5 and 6... Sec 1.. Sec 2... Sec 3.. Sec 4... itme erlayl lfeis... I think 20% of my total brain power has been glitched to run staringintospaceandactinglikeanass.exe.   hahaha.

      Accompanied my gerl to the music shop. GEEEZ... NOT ENUFF SLP....  There were Japanese at the bugis arcade today. the pro from bedok qie-ed them all, and cos of his fugly blocking skills won most of the matches. No matter though, because i realised that every turn that he did with his GDB, the Japanese's FD3S turned faster. Of course, he was BLOCKED to oblivion.   On one hand, i'm kinda proud we s'poreans can hold our own against the Japs in ID. However, all i see is stinky blocking techniques... no honour....   Irohazaka Time : 3"05"4xx   I tried a different set of tyres... but i'm waiting for the 5 spoke Enkei wheels turn up again. i also change the muffler to Creative. GOOOOD acceleration. surprisingly, i got a 0.5 sec reduction in time.. i guess i can improve on technique more.  Had a fun dinner with Jas, Ju, Ah_Pui, Bernard, Hazel and BenChua. Exploding sotongs... geez...   Join the SWS Youth??? aiyoh see Hazel the face i xin tia leh... dunno how..  Thanks Ah_Dog.   $20 for you.  I WILL PICK UP MY SIM CARD 2ML!!!!!!!!!

      aahhhh its been so long since i woke up in the morning and smelled the roses.  south korea still wants to send troops, even after Al-Queda threatened to kill its S.Korean hostage. THAT IS CRUEL. they can't just toss away a life, no matter how low it is, for the sake of sucking up to the U.S of A.   The recording of the hostage was just so pathetic. He was begging and near to tears about returning to his homeland.   That isn't what i was brought up to do. What is the world coming to?  I believe that EVERYONE will find a loved one. EVERY PERSON in the world, be it white, black, yellow, wadsoever. They will find their other half in their lifes. Some when they're young as babies. Some on the day they lay on their death bed. Others in between. However, I believe that each of us will come to a realisation that "Yeah, he/she's the one for me. I know in my heart." Perhaps everyone may have a slight variation in the view of the 'ideal' one, i know that the warm fuzzy feeling is universal.   Thanks Ju, i understand now... so long after you told me...   Gonna accompany my gerl, cos she wanna buy some stuff at Eunos. I went before, but i scared they nv open so early in the morning.   After that, i'm gonna accompany my cousin to play Initial D at bugis again. I'm gonna be serious this time.  AFTER THAT, i'm going to Tampines to have a dinner... Jasmine plan one de. A motley crew of ppl are going, that's what i can say. Oh well, since we're all in different places, in different lives, i guess my appetite will hold.  I can't say that for my wallet, however.   I know that i missed out on several important and saddening episodes that tested the friendship of this close group of my friends, namely Lychee, Levis, Bui_Gia, Gay, Ah_Dog, Monkey, and Mama. I wasn't there for them, in times of need. Therefore they all have a 'bond' towards each other. I can feel it. I am immensely glad that they have not forgotten me...  Haiz, i'm unsure of my existence... I got a girlfriend, yo. I play drums, yo. I'm good in computer games, yo. I'm a player in initial d, yo.   I and my girl... i can say we like each other very much. But i'm unsure of the far future. I play drums, but i dun't play them anymore. I wanted to get a drumset, but my parents decided it too much of a bother, and didn't approve of it. I'm good in computer games, but not god-like. I can say that, because i got a lousy comp at home, and the games like AOM, Rise of Nations, CS, all i play at cybercafe. I aspire to be god-like in games, not just good. Same with Initial D. I (used to) hold my own against others, but now my skills have deteoriated. Compared to Shini, i am just a peon.  No worth in life...

I try not to say the word 'i dunno' le.   Haiz...........................................  I guess things must change. i used this blog as a means for me to reflect on myself. to make sure that what i say, i wont forget. A personal checkpoint.  After all, its the mind that makes us human.

      Its kinda intriguing how sometimes my girlfriend and me display flashes of telepathy.   Like the time she presented me with the heart shaped bottle full of folded stars last friday... I was at Popular the night before, wondering whether to buy a heart shaped bottle and fill it up with stars. I felt that i couldn't make it in time for the next day, so i dropped the idea. Imagine the surprise when i unwrapped the box she gave me.  Or the many instances when i took my hp and wanted to sms her, but suddenly the hp vibrates in my hand and she sms me first. >.  Sagara Sousuke: "Guzen-ka..."  LOL dat monkey from last time spells "Riddick" as "Riddle". RIDICULOUS!!! When i saw  urlLink this , i was immediately reminded of the uncanny resemblance to monkey when he's sleepy. WAHAHAHAHA!!! AGREE WITH ME RITE?!?!?!  Er-hem i'm being mean... sshhh i'll stop...

      Hiya boys and girls, its new-blog-post-that-is-so-boring-you're-gonna-fall-asleep-reading-it time!  Aggh... i'm reading this autobiography on a strange man... smt Windgate ( UPDATE:  his name is Orde Wingate), i'll tell y'all later. he is a STRANGE guy...   Hmmmm.... Political stuff...  urlLink johnkerryisadouchebagbutimvotingforhimanyway ...  The band concert was disappointing... the repetoire was repeated for the choir (GEEEZ) and the band played extremely bad. i could HEAR the different pitches in the long notes whenever that happened. grating to the ears... Salman and Surin cocked up on the timpani solos... Not that i've nver cocked up on them, but of course i'ma disappointed loh...   My girl very sad abt her seniors leaving... well DUH, like i wasn't SAD abt my seniors leaving.. missed them sorely.. but my batch worked hard for silver.. and we DID get it. maybe she doesnt see the whole picture... maybe she doesnt want to. i didn't know howto react to that... cos my reaction was to sulk for awhile and then accept it. she will too... i know she will... haiz she's so fragile that way... she cried lei. make me worried onli..  I think she is someone with a naive and childlike outlook on life. some of you may come and tell me "Oh yeah, she's like, 14?" Well i'll tell you, you haven't seen the attitudes of some kids (of which Mama rightly calls them "stupid kids who act beng only", among others).  Of course she has a more mature side to her, but i'm talking too much, arent' I?  She's one of the few people that aren't "cocked up", in my honest opinion. The term "cocked up" i need to think properly through before defining, but basically she's just plain cool and cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Enough of my rambling.  I'd like to say that sleeping in a freezing cold room is better than sleeping in a steaming hot room.  Eyes on Me by Faye Wong for the game FFVIII still moves me to this day. Blink182's I'm Sorry is so, so sad.  My dad's coughing away. Hope he gets well soon... he alwaes recovers aniway...  Good night..

King of Chaos' Tuberacer is HARD. but its addictive... try it out!!! But you gotta sign up...  urlLink so sign up under me !!! Well i got 202 for Tuberacer, but the top score's like friggin 1338. >.   urlLink This  looks promising. Got lots of philosophical crap to rant abt, but i'm lazy. Stupid looking  urlLink transformers dancing  for your brainwashing pleasure!   Reading  urlLink this  infuriates me. The Quran is THE holy book for all Muslims... Its the same with The Bible for Christians. Therefore it's kinda obvious the way this training manual tries to brainwash people with extensive quotes from the Quran, used in Al-Qaeda's context. Shit, i know that last sentence can be rephrased in another better way. Ah fuck it.  Yeah Sasa jie sms me 2day!!! we sms so much stuff arh... nv knew 160 chars were enough for a decent, intelligient conversation. Wait... Its been awhile since i did have a decent, intelligient conversation with anyone.   What you staring at?  Hmmmm... Nice fun times we had... She's someone i admire very much. So smart, yet able to communicate well. Friendly and tactful. Someone who i feel i can communicate with the best. The person i communicate with worst is Mama.   WhAATTT you STARRINNgg ATTTttT???   But Mama and me got some common indulgences... like Warcraft III, Initial D, drums, and Diablo II, among others. All these he takes seriously and is good in them. Me leh, macham bo chap arh... play for fun nia... MWAHAHAHAHAHHA SEASON 2 COMING OUT I'MA CHIONGING RANKING LIAO HOHOHOHOHOHO. Skelly+Revive+IronMaiden Necro.

      Yoz. I'm sleepy and bored. I'm always sleepy... and bored. hmm. That's me. Boring and... sleepy.  Went to watch Spider Man 2 with my gal. Nice. Read da reviews and all that shyt. Ah.. i respect Dr Octo Octavius. Worked his life, but his formula proved wrong in the end. In the comic things turned out differently i think... forgot abt it.  I read a Marvel comic, The Exiles. Cooooool... Marvel comics' animation style is nice man.   Wah fuck man school starts so fast... 1 more day liao.....  Reminder to self : PHOTOCOPY THE SCORE...  Aiyah i sad larh Joanne so mean to me today. >.  Good to hear that Bui_Gia's mother does NOT have stage 4 (the most lethal) breast cancer. She has stage 2, which can be treated. She'll recover fully... thank the big guys up there.   Yeah all that's all bye.

      I'm fed, and i'm bathed. By myself of cuz. I'm happi! gywahaha  Mrs Chua my Mathematics lecturer will be my avatar of death by year's end. But i'll try my bez to do well in the Maths module... (i know i can't..) Her english is okokok lah, but she mispronounced "Nowadays" as "NowSAday"... lol.. she was talking abt her hair and she say "NOWSADAY arh, bla bla bla" very funny sia!  And then Mr Ng, the Java Programming lecturer was a sarcastic cynical wisecracker. We laffed at his lame jokes ("KNOWLEDGE is 96% but ATTITUDE is 100%") but as the lesson progressed it grew more and more boring.. =X   Went to the library, and realised how messy the NYP online thingys are. I got 2 accounts, 1 of which i totally didn't know howto get in. I ended up being late for a problem solving lecture (not sure if that's what the module called) which was kinda simple...   I guess the hardest modules would be the Maths and Java programming... haiz... muz chiong maths.  I end at 4pm on Monday, 5pm on Tuesday (2ml), 3pm on Wednesday, and 5 pm on Thursday. Not too bad lah.. what i expected.   On the bright side... there's Raven and Mama in my sch... along with A.E and Teresa. And frens are being made fast. So i guess it won't be that bad...   No excessive breaks except on Tuesday, of which i have a break from 10am to 12noon. 2 hrs arh.. do wad sia...  Monday my break 1pm-3pm. Wed and Thurs beak at 1110-1200.  I HAV NO LESSONS ON FRIDAY!!!!!!! SONG BOZZZZZZZZZ....  Saw ChuanZhi and Ah Boon's Xing Gan Mei Nu. Both nv recognise me lah. haha Ah Boon she wear very xing gan lei!

      1/24th of your day. 1 hr of 24hrs of your day. 60 mins of 1440 mins of your day. Is it too much?  I just want to see your face.   So many chiobu in my sch, but i'm looking at my neoprint wif you.  Time flies, people pass by. Crack jokes, laugh, talk about nothing, passing by. Like they're all flying past me.  I stop.  I'm still there, yeah. I'm listening in class, i'm taking notes. I laugh when people joke, i groan when homeworks' addressed. I make small talk, I gossip.  But you're in the back of my mind everytime.  Fuck this mushy shit. I'm gonna go Changi Airport, go eat some fucking ice-cream.   Many things to type about, but i'm feeling fucked right now.

      Long Time No Update.   I'm getting better with my school. Teh usual shyt stuff, getting early, eating bfast, lunch, dinner... The daily grind of life which i hate..   The school had the taste to broadcast Naruto's Main Theme. The song blasting arnd the Block A.. woo hoo nice nice. Friends' support strengthened.   Chuen Long was totally not who i thought he was. I thought looked (somewhat) like Daniel Huang. i remember Daniel very well. He was a nerd with an attitude. He's got a faaast comp, and he plays the latest games. He listens to Eminem, other rappers, and lots of hardcore rock. He's VERY good with english (better than me, i'll admit) and he is very ready to express his discontentment with something, whether people wanna hear it or not. His mother passed away during sec 4 due to cancer... he handled it quite well i must admit. He bonded with his father during this period, i can feel it. A real unique individual.  Chuen Long on the other hand, was totally disappointing. He is a PC-modder. He knows OS, programming, all that shyt. But he doesn't have a LIFE. I thought he sounded like daniel, but i found out he SUCKED at english, he stutters, and he onli noes MATHS MATHS MATHS. however, he's doing a good job researching stuff. Ppl no life mah.. bo pian...  On the other hand, Jeannette and Ryan are kinda interesting.  Opinions of classmates may change during polytechnic experience, however.   Haiz. 3 hrs a day wasted in commuting to and from poly. I see the same cars passing everyday. The new Blink CD has a detrimental effect on me siah... fucks it nv fails to make me depressed.   Fucks.   Gotten much closer to my ah dear in these short short period. Why she sleep always nv tell me de...   I watched Spirited Away. its nice. Ah boon, Mama, anime junkies, watch it.   Watching The Outsiders. Its Dou Yu in chinese, meaning Fighting Fish. watched 2 eps, left 12... haha..  New Cd needed. Remind self to sms and call and pay more attention to ah dear. Remind self to do hw tomorrow. Remind self of a million things which i forget a second later and remember at the most "desirable" times.    urlLink America is fucking itself up ...   urlLink This  is kinda gripey, but this will be what i say to myself if i'm in that position.  Insecurity Issues Abound.

      i wanna go and sleep.   sleep.  sleep.  sleep.  but if i sleep, problems wont solve themselves.  i hear Ju's words "Stop your self denial!". i wish i had someone to confide in. i really wish. wish so bad.   i chose to go nangyang was to start anew. to stop depending on frens. to start doing things on my own.   and i find out that cynthia liked me cos of a fren.  i'm really scared a very hansem guy, who's humorous without being lame, who watches all the latest drama serials, who plays the piano really well, who is really good in chinese, who is really good in basketball, who is really tall, who isn't gong, who has the capacity and time to dote on cynthia comes along and snatches her away.   i want to find out what i can do w/o reliance on anyone.   P.S this is my voice of despair. my voice of reason's opinion shall be heard. but i wont have the time or mood to post it.

      Dots dots dots....   I wrote a LONG post, but somehow it got deleted and was never posted up. shitty.   Things did not go well for Cat's BBQ. It was drizzling slightly, and there was someone i did not want to meet who was going. Sian ji bua, all the ppl there are not ppl i can say i'm comfortable with, except Jasmine. Although i can also count Ahpui and Zonka as friends lah... Last time Cat oso help mi alot... but i duno why i nv talk to her liao.   Passive peer pressure from friends teasing me abt her, i guess. Sorry Jas, for pang-seh you.   I think noneed to go Kimage liao, i go cut somewhere le... Been talking abt it for so long, haiz 4get it.   The past is what makes me.   And I hate the past.   Bleh... Listening to Glay - Kimi Ga Iru right now... and its reminding me of the few (a week and a half, or less, i think) extremely late nights (right up to 6am i think) I spent during the holidays chiong-ing Initial D seasons 1 and 2, and the movie. Waahhaha..... nice show!   Going to watch Mean Girls with Quek and Jas... Sorri Boon, its she suggest the movie one.   Lol, Lindsay Lohan&nbsp;is teh hot on&nbsp; urlLink F.U.B.A.R. . Some really sick, really perv, really funny stuff there. To the typical Singaporean, its a revolting perv site. But the people are just really being asses and pervs for the fun of it. People being total assholes and pervs, cos they can't in real life. They've got normal lives, i can assure you. Oh yeah, the webmaster Justin is from Brunei.   Just watched finish the first episode of GTO : Drama Serial. The sequel to Great Teacher Onizuka (GTO), its kinda interesting. I feel for the characters, especially the O himself. He seems to love attention and does outrageous stuff, but i guess its cos of his upbringing. He also appears not to have self-confidence (notice it) at least in the drama serial.&nbsp;The O&nbsp;also said "I like girls like  and Hirosue Ryoko". WOOOOOOO I and him&nbsp;the same taste!&nbsp;Gwahahahahaaha.&nbsp;I would (probably wont, lol) watch the anime and read the manga.   Java Programming and Mathematics. Killer subjects.   Got some stuff that slip my mind&nbsp;when i wanna type it out. Farkz.   I'm gonna wake up early and send my girl to school. I dunt care lah, she's indirectly making me become the procastinator again. Cos there's a present in my bag, waiting to be unwrapped.   Last time i met my girl : Friday.  Last time talked to her : 1030pm just now. She fell asleep b4 sms-ing me. Farkz lah cb canot sms mi good nite arh.   Bth her sometimes. But i never tell her arh. Haiz... I love her so much.   Went out to Suntec City's Marche to eat yesterday nite. WOW SOFT SHELL CRAB YUMMMMYYYY!!!! I think the cheese sausage is a waste. $8.20 siah. ouch............   Must control my finances... I've got a $130&nbsp;soft toy&nbsp;and&nbsp;an MP3 player on my mind(IRiver perhaps). There's also the long term goal of saving up to buy a drumset with mufflers. My classmate Jasper gian me into jamming again...    urlLink Chio bo?  &nbsp;That's just for the super convenient one.. If i really wanna buy, i'll buy  urlLink this . But if got 40 or 80 GB versions loh.   2ml got 4 hrs of maths... (maniacal laughter) I'm dead!   I just wanna while my time away, doing nothing much out of the ordinary... Live in the country perhaps, living a day for a day.  But no, i'm born in Singapore. The fast-paced,  kiasu  metropolis, trends changing as fast as PCs come out.  So i've settled to venture into the computer entertainment industry (read : PC GAMES) and earn a healthy $10 million and retire. Oh yeah, $100 million , why not?  Then i'll buy a farm. She said she'll like to have a farm. Of course, we'll hire people to do the dirty work.   Dream on..........   Sorry to Joanne for not helping you. I'll make it up somehow.   Written testis for Ju and Sarah. No creative energy to write to anyone else.   I wrote one for my girl too... But she nv put it up...   Ryan said: "Have more self confidence" . I realise you do not know me well enough yet. I also feel that I do not need to know you more than what i am comfortable enough with. I dislike being pressured into a friendship. You think i haven't been through anything right? I say, FUCK YOU. You seem like a stupid emo immature ass bitching about every other thing anyway, what right you got to say anything to me?   And you seem gay.   Jeannette is a nice ger arh. Very like a da jie siah... if i got a da jie, she'll be the bez!   I cant behave normally in school. Why????? muz try to be my normal weird self.   I'm going to be a sour bastard this week. I hope my girl can brighten my day, if not i'll drown myself in homework and music.   Music, music. I bought BoxCar Racer... Every song in the album is good. They're gonna alleviate some of the emptyness in my bus rides to and from school.   A JBallad classic- First Love by Utada Hikaru.   I dig  urlLink Transformers . Shut the fuck up, they're nice. Did you know that  urlLink Spiderman  had a cameo in TF? And  urlLink G.I. Joe  too!   Yay Morrowind is nice. My cousin introduced me to levitation, where its essentially the noclip cheap from Half-Life. Ah, the game that started the FPS boom. And Counter-Strike. I may have a future in Gaming History, if there is such a thing.    urlLink The Duel Project . Two films i would wanna watch. And the other films by both the directors too. Got this off F.U.B.A.R. , so i apologise if it seems like a ripoff, but the point is, i dig. And yeah Sarah, its along the lines of Battle Royale.   I woke up with a stiff neck. It hurt, and made me grumpy. But its gone now, magically. I'll sleep in a proper position 2nite. Maybe i have a mastery of yoga, but only when i'm asleep. Cos when i get up, i'm in some weird yoga-ish postition, with my arms and legs all over. Lol, just bs i noe.&nbsp;But i'm a lamer at heart, bo pian. So says my girl... grrrr... she complain i make her lame.. but the temptations of being lame are just too irresistable...   PH342 T3H L4l\/l3!11!!one!1   I also realise that i have a different lingo from everyone. From Boon and guys, from my classmates, from my gf and her friends, from my pri sch friends, from Jas and Quek and all of them.   Where do i belong??? Why am i what i am?????    urlLink "I think, therefore I am." - René Descartes. &nbsp;I will read the article soon... but the line itself has lots of thought-provoking stuff.   I see myself in an alternate reality as a professional drummer, in a world-reknown rock band.&nbsp;In another alternate reality, I'll be a good ol' ranger, living off the land, and rearing a white tiger. Or a storybook writer. Or a philosopher.   Dream on...   Ah.. finally i'm starting to feel sleepy. Blogging is therapeutic.

      Is it a coincidence that my nick (minus z) means  urlLink this ? Look under the Japanese definition.   I think i'm a melodramatic, reflective, nostalgic bastard. You guys think so too.   I saw Mean Girls wif Quek and Jas. I feel Lindsay Lohan's boobs are too big. But she's teh hot all right. The movie was also full of crap, i laughed from my soul today, rather than making sour lame jokes. I wanted to go home early. I wasn't in the mood for talking, i wasn't in the mood for anything. I wanted to go home to talk to Cynthia.  Go home, we got to talk for only half an hr. She wasn't really in the mood for talking on the fone, and i wasn't in the mood to get her in the mood to talk&nbsp;over the fone.&nbsp;To think i could have talked with Jas and Quek abt so much if i was willing to open my fucking mouth, but all i was thinking abt was Her Her Her. I went back straight to my hse sumore, i forgo Popo's dinner. To have a lousy conversation, and to wait in anticipation for her call, when she was talking to Cleo. She sees Cleo in sch all day lor. Wad the fuck talking to me so hard arh.  Sumore she keep on dunwan me meet her, she last time also go out wif me is cos "I feel very bad leh, pang seh him so many times." quoted by her.You so busy can tell me rite? You can sms me when you going to bed rite? so i can at least say good nite to you WHEN UR AWAKE NOT WHEN UR ASLEEP? I am sending sms to you and half the time you're not replying me. I'm asking you out ALL THE TIME and you say dunwan 3/4 of the time. I understand you say you dunwan to 'explode the landmine' of your parents, but that was like 3 weeks ago? Then there's the fucking nagging worm called JEALOUSY. i'm JEALOUS of the fuckers in her class, who see her everyday and have fun wif her everyday. I'm jealous of the fuckers she plays bball with, and are so gam wif her. Why she reject that Chung Cheng guy that stays near her for me? I really dunt know why. But my stupid mind keeps on saying "Suzhen influence her".&nbsp;  I admit it now. My relationship with Cynthia is not going smoothly. Yea yea giv me that crap about every relationship has its ups and downs, but WHAT THE FUCK, this is MY relationship. I care so much abt others, but now, when i finally feel that this relationship is worth the time and effort, I'm faced with this.   Suzhen may say, "It may be me who help, but all the jio-ing is done by youself wad." But i still dunt know larh.  I said to Ju that i'll always be the one giving in. I do that now, in seemingly every little thing. I ask myself now, "Is it worth it?" And i shall say now, "Yes it fucking is. Remember how Ju helped you? For her sake, be a nice guy. In the face of problems, do not change your principles." I shall continue to grit my teeth and give in to her.  The super realistic and pessimistic bastard in me burns me&nbsp;by saying," Wah lan eh, she's only 14 lei,&nbsp;how she will understand this stuff one?"   And I&nbsp;sigh. I am resigned to this. I am resigned to the hard,&nbsp;foolish path i&nbsp;chose for myself. But i will push on.   I not going overseas cos&nbsp;I dun't want to&nbsp;leave overseas and waste 2 or 3 valuable years without her. I'm in poly liao, i'm growing old liao, there's no time in life liao, canot waste time. That means i need to&nbsp;do extremely well in my poly studies.&nbsp;Oh&nbsp;God, is this worth it?   Its worth it.&nbsp;  Pua cheebye i sound like a fucking moron/lamer/old-fashioned bastard.   But be realistic abit, after&nbsp;Poly,&nbsp;i go NS and U. Where got time to enjoy wif her?   I am really very paranoid that a hansem guy will whisk her away.  Sec 2, 3, and&nbsp;4 are the most happiest days I have experienced in my life. I want Cynthia to experience the same thing.   If i with her, i demand so much of her time. I stifle her fun. I think i am&nbsp;making BGR a chore. I&nbsp;think she'll be happier&nbsp;if&nbsp;all&nbsp;that feelings&nbsp;we had towards each other were&nbsp;left unsaid.   But now stead le.&nbsp;3 months le. How? Should i pull myself together and grit my teeth, or shld i give it all up?   Is it worth it?   I really dunno how larh.   Is&nbsp;Suzhen making&nbsp;Cynthia feel more&nbsp;than what she actually really feels&nbsp;towards me? &nbsp;  Its really very hard to dig into Cynthia to find out her feelings. My brain really want to explode....................   On another unrelated note, i have the answer as to why i got so little guy friends. Guy friends have&nbsp;a few steady ones i feel is enough liao.   I duno 2ml i wait for Cynthia to call or reply me. Or whether i shld call her.   I tired le lah.... i really want to giv up and be a nerd liao... no girls, no frens,&nbsp;juz me, my books, and pr0n.   Lol. joking. But you fuckers will suan me abt the above sentence anyway... so there.   Anyway... This fucking blogpost let me complain so much liao. I oso got a chance to type out all my thoughts ( or at least some lah, i got some thoughts blur blur one). Thus i oso sort out my thoughts lah... at least somehow... haha...  I am lame shit lah... where has the reasoning Quek taught me gone to??????????????????????????? Last time everything seems so simple. Now.... everything is unsure..........   It doesnt help that peer influence has started to make me sound like a fucking gay. stupid fucking ryan, sounds like a cheebye gay, sing britney spears songs so fucking irritating cheebye go get a life idiot, and cut off ur fucking cock so i can stick in up ur ass. I dunt care how readily you defend yourself, you're still GAY.   I put up with gayish-ness, with Chuan long's eliticism. I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT.   Da jie Jeannette.............. haiz.......... i will smile and shrug it off.... i will smile... i will smile 2molo.... i will smile.... i will laugh............ i will crack lame jokes..... i will be the crapper. i will be JChou, the bhb lame ass who has a crooked smile to match his crooked glasses.   I am pathetic.   Let me see the light of day........ like last time....... now stress is cracking me.... i muz carry on... canot juz shut off and bo chap Cynthia, or my studies. kkk i wont repeat my mistakes.

      Yozzzzzz. Sorry for my emo posts... Poly is fucking me up seriously.  Ryan sent me  urlLink this . Seriously, check it out. The vid is only 11 mb. It seriously had me laughing non-stop. Look around the site too. He ain't so bad if i'm in a tolerable mood... haha...  I no longer have insecurity issues with Cynthia. She and I are officially crazy over each other. hahaha...  Mama has a personal  urlLink homepage  up. A very normal site, nothing out of the ordinary. But Mama contructed this page from the ground up using HTML code ONLY, no frontpage or wadever, so he deserves some credit.  I'm crazy now, as you can see. I don't have enough sleep... NUTS... i got to do a powerpoint presentation on Virtual Reality. I'm only half-done.. i started at...1230am i think. Was on the fone with Cynthia, i talked to her for practically the whole day today... from the morning when i took the cab to school, when i was in the lectures, when i got home( my hp ran out of batt 1/2 way during sch time). I took a nap at 630pm and woke up at 930 (lol i wanted to wake up at 730 but oh wad the hell) and we talked again at 10pm. until 1230.  Told you we're officially crazy over each other.  Can't wait for December to come...  She said Friday can ponteng class for me... cos friday is National Day celebrations, bo chap. haha  Ok back to Earth. My A Maths is NOT fine. I got drawings to pass up by this week, i got that fucking powerpoint, i got Creative Media Design Qns to be typed out by Thursday. Thats 50 fucking questions, 2 fucking days from now. Its a night and 2 days, but wad the hell, i'm gonna sleep for 4 hrs only again anyway.  I can go thru this crazy week. I know i can.  I've got some blogger posting material, but i forgot them when i just begin to type. Shit man...  I've been taking a cab to sch... But its fine, cos i dunt spend my money except this cab, the food in sch, and dat's all.  Weekend dunt count lah.. movie, clothes..$60 for the weekend, $20 each day (Friday no sch, counted as a weekend lah). Can lah...  Must remind self to wake up in 3 hrs time...

      I shall resolve to be a better man.  Its been hard to survive without feeling love. Ya, that's right, i have never felt love in my life.Not strong enough by my parents, or anyone else. The person who really imprinted the definition of love into me was Ju. Then i tried to believe in myself. i was too plain stupid to try for ash. Too dumb...  Then time flew... Straight to December, where the school band went to Australia for an exchange program. I remembered I got play with Cynthia at the pool during the farmstay. Then we on the plane also got play alot... although its hazy. I remember talking to Jasmine and Juri about Cynthia... and they were like: "cYnNnThIaAaA~~". Haiz how i miss last time...  Time flew again.. a couple of months. I went back to band practise with Ju and Jas, and she came and asked for my number. Then we started sms-ing each other from there.  Then suddenly Suzhen come and sms mi. She essentially enabled the "iseedeadpeople" cheat onto me. But it was for the better good, because on the same day I asked for Cynthia to be my stead (which was... 2 weeks after Suzhen first sms), some guy asked Cynthia earlier in the day.  Thank God she chose me.  (P.S. I typed out every single detail what happened that caused us to be so close, but i decided it was too personal... everyone needs his/her secrets!) Well, here i am now, with this beautiful pretty girl as my girlfriend. She may only be 14, but I don't care about age and what people think anymore. I really love her, because of who she is. I wanna grow with her, I wanna be her knight in shining armour.  I have now resolved to be a better man. And with Cynthia as my beacon, along with all whom i respect (who are all my family and friends) and for the sake of finding out my true worth in life.  wahaha all of you who read this blog think i take life too seriously rite? dunt wori lah, i just typing all of this down so that i can prove to myself that i DID write this things down(  i feel i got a memory prob ).  Song Plug of the day that you won't even bother to download : Blink182 - Shut Up. (fuck, download EVERY blink song. You won't regret any of them.)  Went with Monkey to cut hair at Bapok. Haiz... made mi miss last time... I suggested we go eat ban mien for old time's sake. And we did. He took the guitar back too...  Kino signs off here.

      Damn comp. I cant even open my webpage properly. But i've been looking thru the HTML and there's nothing wrong. I guess its just my computer. This lousy computer is as antiquated as a Soviet-era Russian oil rig (where the hell did i think of that?) and its holding up until now only because i frequently run maintenaince stuff. The only saving grace of this comp is the sound system (i feel its even better den Brandon's). Of course i not so kua zhang as Mama go and make surround sound lah, but this speakers sound goooood-ah.  Monkey is online. His nick is "tWinS cuMinG on 12 aUg 04... steady pals pls feel free 2 contact mi We can go there 2gether !!steady ma!! go la!! or else i psyco".wahahaha  I got crazy stomach probz... damnit.  2ml going crystal jade...  remind self to do hw and studi.  Geeezzz i'm becoming more guai liaoz... yay!
