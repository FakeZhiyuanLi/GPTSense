						   I work in a financial services office. One of my bosses' elderly clients sent a $35 money order in to her account, and it was returned to us for the following reason:   Per the USA Patriot Act the following monetary instruments are no longer accepted: Money Orders, Cashier checks, Traveler's Checks, and Bank Drafts  .  Apparently she is going to have to pay $5 for a bank check, and then write a letter indicating where she got the money - was it from Social Security? A gift, perhaps? Is the icy wind which is raising the libertarian hairs on the back of my neck only felt by me?  It is fascinating to me that Republicans style themselves to be against government regulation when that is clearly not the case. I live in Illinois, where we may soon have a black male senator - Barack Obama. Now the Republicans in the state are fronting their own black man, Alan Keyes. The white guy in my office thinks that Keyes is very cool - you can stay Republican while at the same time feeling progressive by voting for a black man.  I turned to his official website to see how Mr. Keyes justifies running for senate in a state in which he has never lived. Instead of speaking authoritatively about how he would address any of the challenges which face Illinois, Mr. Keyes pretty much says that he is compelled to run because Obama is a baby-killer.  The following link is to Mr. Keyes' coyly sickening announcement speech:   urlLink http://www.renewamerica.us/archives/speeches/04_08_08illinois_announce.htm   I'm so glad that the Republicans are here to protect us from alleged Democratic baby-killers and octogenarian money-launderers. Knowing that I can count on them, I feel my personal threat level moving from Code Magenta all the way down to the warm and fuzzy Code Goldenrod.

						   Okay, so today I was in the office building's locked bathroom and heard voices outside. To be helpful, I opened the door so that they didn't have to use their key.  The middle-aged white woman smirked, pinched my brown arm, and said, "I hope you don't want a tip for this!"  I don't know, do you think I should have let her live?

						   About two years ago I suddenly began hiccuping poetry.  The following is my first poem, written for the brilliant but hygiene-challenged English English professor for whom I pined in my twenties.      Love Stinks   My nose is lonely for your scent; if you had washed more often, I probably wouldnâ€™t miss you at all.

						   Well, friends, I have needed to do something in order to express myself. I was unemployed for about a year, and I started a new job in the middle of July.  I am alone in an office where everyone has quit, and apparently it is my job to recruit their replacements. I have a 27-year-old assistant who resents me, sabotages my work, and laughs long and hard whenever I make a mistake; a remote manager who has never provided any training but who calls me periodically to yell at me for forgetting to do things that I was never told to do; and an on-site manager who hates my remote boss so much that he orders me to do the opposite of everything my boss tells me to do. These guys can't even agree on when my workday starts - remote guy says 8 a.m., onsite guy doesn't want me there until 9.  It is now the middle of August. My stomach always hurts, my right eye has begun to twitch, and I periodically distress my children by bursting into tears. Whether or not anyone reads these postings, I hope that they will serve as a safety valve until I figure a way out of this mess.
