      it is official: i have no life. wednesday, i went to silks practice from 8-10am. we learned more to our routine (which is gay because miss staats made it up) and found out the theme this year is "latino music". oh, how fun it will be to see our 10-person marching band try to play latino. i went home, and slept for the rest of the day.  thursday, i slept and watched tv all day. it was very productive. i probably gained like 5 pounds from eating so much too. i went to king buffet for dinner. cassie brought me over a present. it was a long-sleeved shirt from steve & barry's that said "banana hammock" on it.  friday, more sleeping and tv. that night, i went to matt's house for a movie night. i'll try to remember all the people who were there: me, cassie, emily v, beth, matt's cousin, matt, nate, zach, paul, jeff, bobby, kevin, boop, and roadie. we watched wrong turn and half of the butterfly effect. we also had a huge whipped cream fight and got it all over matt's house. it was sticky.  today i went to the pool with cassie. emily v showed up and we swam for a little but the water was freezing. we went to matt's and made him feed us, and we went to bilo and got pop and chips. i came home and i wasn't feeling good so i layed down for a while. i think i might go down to floodway park and check out that heritage festival soon.

      yay! "the blog" is back! oh, how i missed it...  today emily vargo, nate, jeff, and i went to indiana county's friendly man-made beach, also known as yellowcreek. the water was somewhat cold, but a few spots were really warm (creepy). we had mud fights and played on the little playground. we also bought an inflatable beach ball and played volleyball with it. we took the ball in the water and started playing "monkey in the middle" with it (yes, we were reliving our childhoods) when this little 7-year-old girl swam up to us and kept asking us to throw her the ball. she was really annoying and we tried to ignore her, but she started asking our names. jeff told her his name was jesus, nate was jebadiah aka todd, i was betty lou, and emily was sue. it was a lot of fun and i got tan so it was a good day.   now i am sitting here on the computer, talking to my friend zack from florida. i met him last night and we talked all night. he's 16, he surfs, he's on the football team at his high school, he plays paintball, and he plays bass in a band (they won 3rd place in battle of the bands last year). he also sent me a picture and he's pretty good looking. i also made a friends with a drummer named andy and jamie from new jersey.   well i am going to go eat a lovely dinner (porkchops yuck!) and then maybe go hang out with my friends or something tonight.
