      ...from now, I'll be setting up a tent in the North Georgia mountains.  Now, that might not sound like fun to some folks, but when you live every day in a dirty, ugly city like Atlanta (actually, it's only really dirty and ugly in the heart of summer and winter), you look forward to fresh air, green grass, trees, and clear water.  Also, 22 hours from now, I will be dropping off my roommate's 18-year old kid at college.  Big day for him - bigger day for me.  Two months ago when he called to ask if he could stay with us instead of his mom, I figured, "Sure, no sweat."  I must have been smokin' some crazy shit back then.  The irony is that he was hardly ever there, but boy, when he was...  I just thought my little brother was a lazy ass, but he ain't got nothin' on this kid.  I think he also has short-term memory problems and he might even need a hearing aid.  I mean how many times do you have to say, "Throw  the empty fucking Coke can away!!!!"  OK, enough about that especially considering my roomie might be checking my rants.  In any event, we're headed to the mountains to camp, kayak, eat, drink, and be merry.  I am so jazzed about breathing real air and enjoying my first vacation since January!!  It ain't France, Malaysia, or Peru, but it ain't Altanta either. If I see a beer-swigging bear, I'll be sure to take a picture.  Everyone have a great weekend as I will be sans-technology for the next three days.

      This from "The Blotter" in Creative Loafing.  (The "Loaf" is our avant-garde, bourgeois, liberal local paper):  I probably shouldn't be posting shit from the Blotter 'cause it only undermines my attempt to prove to outsiders that Atlantans aren't backward-ass, knuckle-scratching hicks, but this is a good one.   An officer was patrolling Mayson Turner Boulevard. A white SUV pulled into the intersection, and the officer noticed that the driver was holding a crack pipe to her lips.  The officer stopped the SUV and spoke with the driver, a 23-year-old woman, and the passenger, a 31-year-old man. The man shoved something into his right pocket. The officer asked, "Do you have any weapons or drugs on you?" No, the man said. The officer asked, "Can I search you?" Yes, the man said.  The officer found 1.7 grams of cocaine in the man's pocket. The officer asked, "Why did you give me consent to search you if you had drugs on you?"  "Man, I've been snorting all day," the man replied.  The woman was not arrested, since there was no residue in the crack pipe.

      This is an awesome idea.  Of course, I realize the "tastes like chicken" jokes could go a long way, but think about it.  Let's say you're insane enough to live in Manhattan and you're insane enough to have a cat that you want to take with you every where.  Wouldn't you just love to take the furry critter to dinner?  I know Emmett would empty my bank account and my evil, terrorist cat, Willow, would shred me to a pulp if I tried taking her out of the house.  From the BBC: Cafe cool opens for New York cats Eartha Kitt Eartha Kitt lent her name to the opening of New York's cat cafe A US cat food company has found the purr-fect way of spoiling its feline clients - by opening a Manhattan cafe for them and their owners.  The Meow Mix cafe serves up dishes such as Deep Sea Delight and Cluck a Doodle Doo for the cats, and baguettes and soda drinks for the owners.  There are just two rules, says the Meow Mix Company - no dogs and no catnip.  The firm says the New York cafe will open and, if successful, others could be created around the country.  Movie star Eartha Kitt, who played Catwoman in the hit film Batman, was among those who attended the launch.  "Well, I think the Cat Cafe is a very good idea because it is a wonderful way for us to get acquainted as people because if you have a cat and we have a cat we can all sit at the same table and nosh," she told Associated Press Television.  Cat happy  Other cat owners agreed.  "It would be fun to try it," said Frank Guiterman, who owns a Persian cat called Scarlett O'Hara.  "You know there is no place for people to take their cats, so may be this would work out nicely," he told Reuters television.  "I think if it is going to succeed anywhere, it is going to be right here on 5th Avenue, definitely," said Ellen Levin.  But some, such as Lauren Lazarus, were more doubtful.  "I decided to torture my cat and bring her here but she is not having fun," she told Reuters television.  Richard Thompson, CEO of New Jersey-based Meow Mix Company, said: "Our goal is to keep cats happy. The idea is that you can bring them and start socialising them."

      Bear downs 36 beers, passes out at campground Rainier, not Busch, the beverage of choice for thirsty black bear The Associated Press Updated: 7:26 a.m. ET Aug. 19, 2004  BAKER LAKE, Wash. - When state Fish and Wildlife agents recently found a black bear passed out on the lawn of Baker Lake Resort, there were some clues scattered nearby — dozens of empty cans of Rainier Beer.  advertisement The bear apparently got into campers’ coolers and used his claws and teeth to puncture the cans. And not just any cans.  “He drank the Rainier and wouldn’t drink the Busch beer,” said Lisa Broxson, bookkeeper at the campground and cabins resort east of Mount Baker.  Fish and Wildlife enforcement Sgt. Bill Heinck said the bear did try one can of Busch, but ignored the rest. The beast then consumed about 36 cans of Rainier.  A wildlife agent tried to chase the bear from the campground but the animal just climbed a tree to sleep it off for another four hours. Agents finally herded the bear away, but it returned the next morning.  Agents then used a large, humane trap to capture it for relocation, baiting the trap with the usual: doughnuts, honey and, in this case, two open cans of Rainier.  That did the trick.  “This is a new one on me,” Heinck said. “I’ve known them to get into cans, but nothing like this. And it definitely had a preference.”

      I mean really sad.  This looks like the stadium crowd for a little league basket weaving contest.  Little would you guess it's the stadium crowd for one of the 2004 Athens Olympic games.     I was talking to a friend of mine here and he asked if I had seen any reports of how slack the attendance is at the games.  Both of us are vets of the 1996 Atlanta games and we remember, VIVIDLY, the crowds that hounded our streets for two weeks.  Because we were working in the Olympic Village (Georgia Tech), we didn't have the luxury of escaping the city for the games like the rest of the locals.  I can understand some skepticism and concern regarding security and terrorism, but get real.  We had one hell of a security set up here and that was BEFORE 9-11.  Can you imagine what Athens has?  Not only did we have awesome security, but look where it got us.  We allowed a skinhead-dipshit-assbrain murderer to kill two people with a pipe bomb in the city park.  If your turn is up, your turn is up.    The Olympic Committee thought about giving tickets away, but they said that wouldn't be fair to those who paid.  On the one hand, that pisses me off, because I would KILL to go to Greece, especially since the hotels and restaurants are giving such mass discounts.  On the other hand, if I dropped thousands of buckies to get tickets, fly over there, stay in a hotel... and then they started giving away tickets - hmmmm, yeah, I can see their point.  It's too bad attendance is so poor.  I have a TV in my office and I get to watch all the games live.  Some of the contests are really good, but I feel like I'm the only one watching.

      From CNN this morning:   "A man who stepped outside his house to smoke a cigarette died when a banyan tree fell on him in Fort Myers, authorities said."  As an ex-smoker, I never could master the art of smoking a cigarrette in 120 mph wind and driving rain.    How the fuck do you do that?    Why the fuck would you want to do that?    For Christ's sake, fool!  If you need that smoke so badly, go to the bathroom and turn on the exhaust fan.  Maybe God was trying to save him from the cruel death of cancer.  But really, how is he gonna look arriving at St. Peter's gate and the Great Key Master is laughing his ass off?  St. Pete: (laughing his ass off) A banyon tree?  Ha ha ha That's a good one. What the fuck is a banyon tree?  But, better yet, why were you outside, under the FUCKING tree, in a CAT 3 hurricane?  Stupid Ass Person from Ft. Myers: "I dunno.  I guess 'cause I ain't got no fan in the double wide."  Kiss my ass and call me, Skippy.  Every day is a new day in the Deep South.

      http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3562236.stm  Not that I would recommend this type of justice for everyone, but I think certain criminal types, rapists most definately included, should consider their options when headed for the courtroom.  I mean, is it really so bad to have security protecting  your scumball, criminal ass when you walk into the court?  I guess if I were one of the 25 women, I wouldn't have hesitated - except to perhaps determine the best method of retaliation.

         Yup, this is vaccuum-brain Emmett again (you can tell by that Mafioso look on his face).  This time it's a view of his sleek profile.  Remember that scene in King Kong when the giant ape came through the jungle splitting the trees?  Well, my little man here is only a kitten, but when he drops on the floor, the whole fucking house trembles.  I would imagine he'll tip the scales around 30 LBs by the time he's finished his growth spurt.  When he jumps on the waterbed, it feels like a goddamn tsunami, but what can I do? I wuv my wittle boy.

      OK, I've only been doing this blogger thing for a while, but this one I couldn't resist.  This is the hands-down winner of the Stupid Pet Tricks contest.  This is Emmett and his trick is trying to eat the lens off the camera.  Reminds me a bit of a photo IbeJO put on his site, but at least Nala looked like she had a modicum of intellegence.  Emmett's brain is a pure vaccuum.

         To those of you who want to know what I do when I'm not doing anything... behold, my very own labour of love.  For the past three years, I have been renovating this monster.  Why, you ask?  Because I'm a fucking moron, that's why.  However, after three years, I finally have the basement enclosed (mostly) and once I get next year's tax return, I will install the bathroom downstairs.  It has been hell only having one bathroom (especially when my roommate indulges in too much of his homemade chili), but soon I'll be able to kick him downstairs!!  I have to remember to buy the commercial grade exhaust vent for the downstairs bathroom.     Take note of the party tent.  My roomie picked up two of them from work.  These things are awesome!!

         This little ditty was taken off Sanibel Island yesterday.  Charley looks like a mean MF with a little attitude to boot.  To all of those in west FL, north central FL, and northeast FL (to include you, IbeJO), be careful.  105 MPH winds and 18 foot tidal surges are really no joke.  They also expect Charley to hold together until it reaches the Virginia area.

      OK, so if you don't already know, I live in the Ghetto.  By that I mean I am what some folks call an "Urban Pioneer".  OK, still don't get it?  I live in a neighbourhood where I am considered the cream of the OREO cookie, or should I say the generic chocolate flavoured cookie.  In any event, the Kroger (local grocery chain in the south) is the closest place for us to shop.  That's not to say I can't drive to hoity-toity land (where I used to live) and shop in a real store, but proximity is important when you are tired.  This evening I had to run to the store to get some staples and a "thank you" card for a "friend" of my dad's (more about that in another rant-a-log).  She sent me a cookbook and it was the least I can do, but I didn't think it would be an issue buying a card at the grocery.  Little did I rememeber that I was looking in the "ghetto" Kroger.  Now, most of the time, if you need a card from the grocery, it's no bid deal, however, today was a different experience.  First, there was not one card in the slot it should have been in, i.e., the "wedding" cards were in the "sympathy" section - OK maybe THAT was not an accident - but in any event, it was chaos trying to find the right area.  Once I finally found the "thank you" area, the cards were mixed and so were the envelopes.  Thank God my mum taught me to always check to see if the envelope and card fit.  Well, enough about my stupid idea to buy a greeting card at ghetto Kroger.  However, let me enlighten those who are clueless as to other aspects of ghetto Kroger:  Number One: You can ALWAYS find enough pig-feet for any occasion.  Having a family reunion with 300 people, including your Uncle Gus?  Pig feet fit the bill every time.  If pig-feet aren't enough and you're lookin' for variety, don't forget to stop by the hamhock and gizzard sections - my mouth be waterin' as I write.  Yummy, can I have some chitlins', too.  Don't forget the kidney gravy.  And Americans have a problem with haggis because????  Number Two:  Rotted tomatoes are a show stopper.  Nevermind that any dim-wit, buttface can grow tomatoes eight months out of the year in their own backyard in the south, but ghetto Kroger makes sure their supply is efficiently rotted so you can spend five dollars a pound to be proud.  Number Three:  The assortment of cheeses is astounding.  France is a distant fourth in the type and quality of cheese that ghetto Kroger provides.  There's mild cheddar, sharp cheddar, and very sharp cheddar.  If you're very lucky, you can find some mutts-a-rella, but I ain't got no clue what to do with this.  Maybe waterproof the roof?  Number Four:  Melted ice cream is a real treat.  Considering most folks don't have air conditioning in the ghetto, why bother freezing the stuff in the first place?  If you do find it frozen in the store, be sure that when you get it home, you scrape off all the freezer burn before poisoning yourself.  5)  The pregnant, toothless, teenage cashiers add a real sparkle to my shopping experience.  Every time I see "Shaniquala", or "Diamnondiana" or "Asskissmyfatassa" and they ask me, "What dis be?", I always smile back and tell them, "Oh yes, that is a rare vegetable called a potato."     Well, that's enough of a rant about ghetto Kroger.  I'm finding that by publishing it in my blog, I'm less likely to go postal on my roommate when I get home.  Hail, little Bro, for the blogger into.

       urlLink    OK, so what if the Sudanese are killing each other?  They ain't got no oil so we ain't goin' over there to help.  And these are Arabs, too.  I would have thought at least one of those variables would bring the subject to the front page, but I guess not.  Besides, there's no need to start another war we cannot finish - me thinks Vietnam, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq, are just a nifty, relatively recent few.  Yes, I realize we've finished plenty of wars, Grenada... um, Grenada and...  Well, I know there were others.  Democrats have long been accused of being the party that loves to get involved in other country's business (in the name of preserving or enforcing Democracy), but people!!!!  Come on! CONSISTANCY should be an operative term when we talk foreign policy.  However, when we talk domestic policy, there's plenty of consistancy in the media.  I mean, when someone goes missing or winds up dead, as long as they are white, female, upper-middle class folks from Utah or Califonia, BAM! - Headliners.  Me thinks Polly Class, Elizabeth Smart, Laci Peterson, Lori Hacking.  Now, there's also Kobe.  He isn't white, or female, or upper-middle class, but I bet the girl he had sex with is.    Maybe I'm jsut generalizing.  But can anyone name a black, male, upper class man from Alabama that was killed recently?  No? That's because there is no such thing as an upper-class black man from Alabama.  It's a trick question, but you still get my point.

However, even 33 deserves a personal phone call or something, especially considering the lame gift I sent him.    Sorry I didn't get a chance to talk to you, Little Man, and I hope you had a great birthday!!!!  Love, me

       Disclaimer:  I am Roman Catholic so I reserve the right to unabashedly insult and criticize my own Church:  Starting with this little diddy in today's AJC...  "Atlanta Archbishop John F. Donoghue put local Roman Catholic churches in the middle of the presidential race last week, declaring politicians who support abortion rights should be denied Holy Communion."  Dear Father:  Please keep your goddamned nose out of politics.  The brightest idea the founding fathers had was that separation of Church and State and I can't go around bashing Bush for his line-crossing if you sit there saying the same thing.  Also, this points to another issue I've previously discussed, and that is, abortion is not your decision either.    Keeping on this religious theme, I should take a moment to es-plane my theo-notions.  I happen to be what one could call a "progressive" Catholic (a good friend of mine who happens to be gay and his partner, who happens to be an ex-Communicated Catholic priest, gave me that term.)  Progessive Catholics believe whole-heartedly that the Church needs to rethink some things.  The first Nicean councils were held in the 3rd and 4th centuries.  These come to Jesus meetings were held to determine certain critical aspects of Church dogma.  Then, almost 1500 years later the Church had another Council.  It was kinda like the Pope and the Bishops said, "Shit, we haven't had a pow-wow in a while.  Let's hook up and shoot the shit and change some stuff to keep those lemmings on their toes."  But as far as I remember from Catechism, all they decided to do hear was eliminate the requirement for Mass in Latin and that women had to wear head covers.  My point is that I (and many others) think a lot has happened since JC walked the earth and the Church needs to really reconsider some very important issues.  Some of those topics include:  Christ's marital state (more on this in another blog) Women as priests Homosexuality as moral sin Abortion Birth Control Priest's celibacy ... and there are plenty of others, but getting back to my bud, Archbishop Donoghue, apparently there weren't a bunch of folks at Mass yesterday backing him up so I do feel a little relieved.  Just so I don't appear as a total heretic, I do believe in most of the fundamental Church doctrine, just not some of the ideas that the ancient men chose have us follow.  In other words, I believe in the rules, not the guidelines.  I guess I need to start watching out for lighting bolts.

      Referring to the criticism that Bush endured during the moments he was reading to kindergarten kids and just heard the news about planes hitting the WTC:  "You never saw the seven minutes because they don't want our leader to look like a deer in the headlights... Which is actually being unkind to deer." – Michael Moore  This was a quote heard on the new Bill Maher show that comes on Friday nights 11PM EST on HBO.  Last week was absolutely hilarious as Billy had Mr. Moore, David Dreier, Bill Owens, Kim Campbell and Ralph Nader as his guests.  You really have to wonder how pompous and arrogant Dreier and Owens must be to agree to appear on a show hosted by a liberal, watched by liberals, and including other guests such as Frm. PM (Canada) Campbell and - of ALL PEOPLE - Michael Moore.  The esteemed assface Dreier even said, "By the time this show is over, I will convert you, Bill Maher and even you, Michael Moore, into Republicans.  Mr. Moore's retort was resounding, "Well, wouldn't we be considered 'flip-flopping'.  I missed last Friday because I was half dead and -really- 11 PM???  I am definitely a morning person.  If anyone saw it, pass along some notes as they haven't updated the website as of 6 this morning.  Off to another wonderful - oh, so busy (not) week.

      OK, the thing that really chaps my ass about these girls is that nobody wants to talk about the real "why".  If you haven't heard about these two "heavenly creatures", they are from south of Atlanta and they are 15- and 16- year old lesbians who stabbed to death their grandparents.  The one girl, Holly (the granddaughter) has a Mommy Dearest who is in the state pen for drug possession.  When mum went to the can, grandma and grandpa took Holly in to "save" her.  Now for those who have a real brain, in the south, being "saved" is a little different that tossing someone a cookie when they're starving.  Being "saved" means repenting to the LAUD, that's right the big J.C. himself.    These two geezers were "upstanding members of the Fayette Southern Baptist church" notice they didn't say "community" because in Fayette County, if you ain't part of the baptist church, you ain't part of the community.  One thing that really makes my point hit home is if you look at the picture.  These two girls had to wear bulletproof vests to their arraignment.  This is because the true members of the SBC aka "community", want to kill them.  Hummmmmm, must be that eye-for-eye thing.  But if someone is truly full of shit, they can justify anything by dis-interpreting The Good Book.  http://www.ajc.com/news/content/metro/fayette/0804/08fayetteteens.html

      CNN: "A 74-year-old murderer became the oldest U.S. inmate put to death in decades Thursday after courts and the governor refused to stop his execution."  OK, so Alabama killed a geez.  Not surprising in the least, but what really jerks my chain is that the same Bible-thumpin', conservative, dipshit that pulled the trigger (actually stuck in the needle in this case) is the same Bible-thumpin', conservative, dipshit that voted against a woman's right to abortion.  What's the deal?  Oh, I know, someone has to actually breathe air before it's perfectly sane to kill 'em.  That logic probably works in Alabama, but sadly, it's also the anti-logic of lots of other backward thinking people.  For the record, until men grow a uterus, vagina, some ovaries and other necessary tools, they have NO RIGHT to an opinion on abortion.  'Nuff said.

      Well, as I said, I have to continue the practice of becoming the Almighty QFO so I'm taking off and going to my house.  I have to waterproof the foundation so we can finish building out the basement.  As soon as I can figure out how to post photos, I'll add some so everyone can see that I do actually do something.  Since I come to the office around 6 AM and read all the news stuff I can via the Internet, get ready for some real pinko liberal shit to hit the waves.

       OK, baby bro suggested I start a blog like the millions of other folks out there, but I'm not sure my psycho-babble is worthy.  On the other hand, I don't get a chance to vent my superbly intellectual liberal jargon much considering I live in the ultra-conservative, flag-waving, right-winged, Bible-thumpin' deep south.  Besides, my employers stupidly decided to try to screw me, so I'm going to return the favour and continue to collect a paycheck while I hone my new skills as the "QFO" (not an acroynm I devised, but I think it's clever).  I'm the official "queen of fucking off" at Georgia Tech.  Shouldn't I get an award or a certificate or something?  Maybe I'll design something once I get more practice.  As this is my first blog, I'll keep it short.  I don't want to sound like a conceited little thing, but I can type faster than I can speak so I will probably have a tendancy to rant.
